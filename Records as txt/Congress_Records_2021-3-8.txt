LET’S NOT RESTRICT AMERICANS’ 
FREEDOMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, here in this Chamber, I have 
pledged to support and defend the 
United States Constitution in its en-
tirety. The Second Amendment is a 
key tenet of the U.S. Constitution and 
Americans’ inalienable rights. 
The right to keep and bear arms is a 
basic freedom that was enshrined in 
law by the Framers of our Constitu-
tion, the leaders who overcame tyr-
anny to form a representative govern-
ment of, by, and for the people. More 
than two centuries later, their extraor-
dinary vision for our country still en-
dures. 
In Congress, it is our job to uphold 
the Constitution and to protect Ameri-
cans’ fundamental rights. Yet, this 
week, the House will consider radical 
legislation that would encroach on citi-
zens’ freedoms while doing so little to 
prevent mass shootings or illicit vio-
lence. If enacted, both H.R. 8 and H.R. 
1446 would impose restrictive back-
ground checks and unnecessarily bur-
den law-abiding gun owners. 
Thanks to the work of the previous 
administration 
and 
Republicans 
in 
Congress, our Nation already has safe-
guards in place to prevent wrongdoers 
from acquiring firearms. Rather than 
impose new restrictions, we should 
work together to ensure that the cur-
rent laws on the books are enforced. 
Instead of attempting to defund the 
police, we should equip our law en-
forcement officers with the necessary 
resources and training that they need 
to identify and respond to threats. 
Rather than make criminals out of 
law-abiding citizens, we should in-
crease penalties for those who break 
the law. These are commonsense steps 
that would save lives and protect con-
stitutional rights of citizens in my 
home State of Pennsylvania and across 
our country. 
In recent months, I have heard from 
hundreds of Pennsylvanians who are 
concerned by the mounting attacks on 
the Second Amendment. I share these 
concerns, and I will continue to oppose 
any attempts to restrict Americans’ 
lawful gun rights. Unfortunately, the 
majority is set on restricting Ameri-
cans’ personal freedoms and propelling 
an extreme agenda. This playbook is 
not the answer. 
Right now, Congress should be fo-
cused on crushing the pandemic, get-
ting Americans back to work, allowing 
our kids to safely return to the class-
room. Instead of attacking Americans’ 
constitutional rights, we could be mak-
ing real progress on accelerating vac-
cine production, rebuilding our econ-
omy, and restoring our American way 
of life. 
As we consider H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 
this week, I urge all of my colleagues 
to reject this challenge to our Con-
stitution, to uphold Americans’ intrin-
sic freedoms, and return this body to 
good-faith legislating that drives re-
sults for all of the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1084 
March 8, 2021 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the passing of Oma-
ha’s last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, 
Robert Holts, who passed away on Feb-
ruary 12 at his retirement home in 
Bellevue. 
He joined the still-segregated U.S. 
Army in November 1942, and quickly 
landed in an aviation training program 
that would lead to a slot in the 332nd 
Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee 
Airmen. Not only did he and other 
members make history as the first all- 
Black unit, but they also made history 
through their exemplary service, and 
they changed America for the better 
and forever. 
The famed Tuskegee Airmen pro-
tected Allied bombers during the last 2 
years of World War II. They were the 
first group of African-American mili-
tary pilots and airmen in the U.S. 
Army Air Corps, and Holts was one of 
the 21 Tuskegee Airmen that had ties 
to Omaha. 
Holts continually surmounted the 
challenges of racism, segregation poli-
cies, and the Great Depression faced in 
his life. 
Born in 1924, Holts attended Kellom 
Elementary School and Omaha Central 
High School. Holts had a strong high 
school record, and he was given the op-
portunity to join an aviation program 
that flew P–51 Mustangs. They became 
known as the Tuskegee Airmen, a nod 
to the name of the base they trained 
at. More than 15,000 missions were 
flown by the Tuskegee Airmen, and 
they destroyed 261 German aircraft. 
After the war, Holts worked as a U.S. 
Postal Service employee for nearly 40 
years before settling in North Omaha 
near family. A little more than 60 
years 
later, 
Holts 
and 
his 
fellow 
Tuskegee Airmen were awarded the 
Congressional Gold Medal for their he-
roic actions in World War II. Not only 
have they been lauded for their actions 
as fighters for our country in a world 
war, but as fighters for civil rights for 
all. 
Our country is better and stronger 
because of the Tuskegee Airmen and 
heroes like Robert Holts. We shall al-
ways remember the legacy of Robert 
Holts. 
HONORING GINA PONCE AND B.C. CLARK 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor two women from our 
district for Women’s History Month be-
cause of their commitment to advanc-
ing opportunities and experiences for 
women. Gina Ponce and B.C. Clark are 
historymakers, as they work to em-
power women in our community. 
Born and raised in the Bronx, Gina 
has been in Nebraska for 25 years and 
is the mother of two sons and grand-
mother to one granddaughter. She 
credits her father as her inspiration in 
serving others, as he led by example in 
his service to the community. 
Gina has been in her current position 
as director of Latino community out-
reach at Bellevue University since 2015, 
where she is responsible for managing 
outreach and admissions including the 
Latino community. 
She sees her two biggest accomplish-
ments as founding the Women on a 
Mission nonprofit 11 years ago and 
opening the El Camino Latino Center 
at Bellevue University. Women on a 
Mission engages in outreach to build 
up and empower women and girls spir-
itually, physically, and emotionally. 
Recent awards she received include 
the 2020 Heartland United for Puerto 
Rico Award, the 2017 Women of Color 
Leadership Award, and the 2013 Latina 
of the Year. However, Gina says she 
sees her award every day in the success 
of those she has helped, and she credits 
her own success to the passion and 
gifts that come out of the South 
Omaha community. 
Also 
passionate 
about 
assisting 
women in their visions and dreams is 
the founder and president of the Metro 
Omaha Women’s Business Center, B.C. 
Clark. She continues to inspire women 
and accelerate their success by cre-
ating economic opportunities through 
programs offered by her center. Those 
opportunities include a monthly busi-
ness forum, quarterly Success Series, 
and various workshops and trade shows 
to educate, inspire, and encourage en-
trepreneurs and businessowners. 
In 2014, B.C. also started the Business 
Connection Nebraska, a local tele-
vision show on public access TV, where 
she showcases businessowners from 
across the State. She is also a well-re-
spected speaker and mentor for several 
community 
and 
minority 
business 
groups, where her knowledge of how to 
increase profitability and operational 
efficiency, as well as satisfy customer 
expectations, 
has 
helped 
many 
businessowners excel professionally. 
In 
addition, 
B.C. 
volunteers 
at 
Carole’s House of Hope, where she men-
tors inner-city young women. She is a 
former 
president 
of 
the 
Midlands 
Latino Community Development Cen-
ter, encouraging and promoting Latino 
businesses. 
B.C. credits her faith as a factor in 
her own achievement and is quick to 
recognize others who have helped her 
in her quest to help others find success. 
She also recognizes that a belief in 
yourself will make you successful. As 
she told her own granddaughters: ‘‘You 
don’t have to wait for a man to give 
you a diamond ring. If you want it, you 
can work for it.’’ 
Both Gina Ponce and B.C. Clark are 
role models not only for women, but 
for our community, as they have dem-
onstrated their service to help others 
succeed. Because of leaders such as 
they, the numbers of businesses owned 
by women in the United States has in-
creased by 114 percent in the last 20 
years, and 64 percent of new women- 
owned 
businesses 
were 
started 
by 
women of color.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Tender and loving God, we come to 
You on this International Women’s 
Day in gratitude for the care and ex-
ample You have lifted up before us in 
the women whose lives in some way 
have touched our own, and those whose 
virtue in the face of untold and incon-
ceivable challenges has provided for us 
a legacy of fortitude and faith. 
For women like Rahab and Deborah 
whose bravery and courage challenged 
expectations and changed the course of 
nations. 
For countless and hidden figures who 
continue to challenge institutional 
norms, influencing and enriching na-
tional research, advancements in tech-
nology, social sciences, and the arts. 
For the unheralded mothers who 
challenge the hours in a day and find 
ways to manage households and nur-
ture young leaders. 
For the faithful, like Mary, Ruth, 
and Esther who in the face of cultural 
challenges, nonetheless yielded to Your 
will and effected Your loving plan for 
Your people. 
As we go about our business and ad-
dress the concerns of these days, may 
we hear from the wisdom of these para-
gons, the teaching of kindness. May we 
learn from their lives’ work, the impor-
tance of courage. May we be inspired 
by the strength and honor of these 
women, that our conduct would be wor-
thy of their virtuous history. 
Like them, Almighty God, call each 
of us to choose to challenge the lim-
iting prejudice of expectations, the de-
structive norms of injustice, the over-
whelming crush of daily living; that in 
facing these challenges, each of us 
would prove faithful to and honor the 
gift of life You give us this day. 
We pray in the abiding love of Your 
holy name. 
Amen.

March 8, 2021 
Ms. NORTON led the Pledge of Alle-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

AMERICANS WANT TO BE 
RESCUED NOW 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, with 
final 
passage 
of 
President 
Biden’s 
American Rescue Plan expected tomor-
row, the priorities I pressed for, includ-
ing $1,400 in direct payments per person 
and $26 billion in rental assistance 
makes the Rescue Plan live up to its 
name. 
The rescue extends to the District of 
Columbia, which retrieves $755 million 
taken from the District when Repub-
licans treated the District as a terri-
tory in the CARES Act. Instead, the 
new bill treats D.C. as a State as usual 
because D.C. residents pay full Federal 
taxes, and it funds D.C. for city, State, 
and county levels because D.C. provides 
services at all three levels. 
This bill resisted the Republican plan 
for less money because the American 
people want to be rescued now, not 
later. The American Rescue Plan Act 
will hasten doing our business together 
again on this House floor and getting 
the American people back to business 
and to school. 
f 
CONGRESS IS MAKING PROGRESS 
(Mr. POSEY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, over the 
past 10 years we have made a lot of 
progress in making Congress more 
transparent and accountable. 
After years of persistence, I was 
pleased to see that the House finally 
adopted the comparative text rule that 
I proposed. 
The comparative text rule made it 
possible for Members of the House and 
the public to actually see and under-
stand exactly what a bill changes. 
Every legislature in the country does 
that. But sadly, boom, in an instant 
this year the House abolished that 
rule, even though it was a top priority 
with the bipartisan Government Effi-
ciency, Accountability, and Reform 
Task Force for commonsense solutions 
to a better government. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, that is shameful. 
f 
HELP IS ON THE WAY 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the 
COVID pandemic and economic crisis 
are destroying the lives and livelihoods 
of tens of millions of Americans across 
the country. And our most vulnerable 
communities are bearing the brunt. 
Thankfully, help is on the way. The 
American Rescue Plan will save lives 
and livelihoods by putting vaccines in 
arms, putting children safely back in 
school, putting money in people’s pock-
ets, and finally putting people back in 
jobs. 
I am proud to note the inclusion of 
provisions in this bill for the Virgin Is-
lands and other territories that we all 
in this House have been fighting for. 
This plan creates equality in the child 
tax credit, the earned income tax cred-
it, including an advancement of the 
child tax credit in 2021. 
The child tax credit provision in the 
bill will be transformational in the 
lives of hundreds and millions of chil-
dren, lifting them out of poverty. This 
is generational change. This will re-
duce poverty and improve the eco-
nomic standing of Americans through-
out our country. We are grateful for 
this bill. 
f 
THE MARS ROVER IS AN 
INCREDIBLE MARVEL 
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, 2 weeks ago our country witnessed 
the incredible marvel of American in-
genuity when NASA successfully land-
ed its Perseverance rover on Mars, lay-
ing the groundwork for the next gen-
eration of space travel and exploration. 
Perseverance has four primary goals: 
determine whether life ever existed on 
Mars, understand the climate of the 
planet, characterize the geology of 
Mars, and finally, make any prepara-
tions necessary for human exploration. 
These goals are crucial not only for our 
Nation’s eventual mission to send hu-
mans to Mars, but also for the contin-
ued advancement of mankind as a 
whole. 
Before making its journey to the red 
planet, Perseverance spent some time 
in my backyard in northeast Ohio. It 
was researchers and scientists at Cleve-
land’s NASA Glenn Research Center 
that developed the rover’s power source 
and oversaw testing the rover’s para-
chute needed to land safely on Mars. 
Mars truly is the next frontier in 
space travel and exploration. I am in-
credibly grateful that northeast Ohio 
has added yet another chapter to our 
State’s already rich history in space 
travel and exploration. 
I look forward to what Perseverance 
can teach us about this new unknown 
and what our next endeavor will be. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE GREAT 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WOMEN 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, today is 
International Women’s Day, a day to 
recognize the great accomplishments 
of women and the great possibilities 
that lie ahead. 
During the course of the day we will 
be having some recognitions. But one 
very important one is that: As we 
speak here now, on the Senate side, 
they are finishing up the engrossment 
of the American Rescue Plan. 
This plan, as my distinguished col-
league from the Virgin Islands pointed 
out, does so many great things for 
America’s children, America’s families, 
and America’s women. If you are a 
caregiver, whether for a child or a sen-
ior or whatever, childcare is substan-
tially supported in this legislation. 
If you are a teacher, schools will be 
able to be open more safely with in-
creased funding to do so with ventila-
tion, separation, and the rest to have 
our children and teachers return safely 
as well. 
The child tax credit and the refund-
able child tax credit, the earned in-
come tax credit—as was mentioned by 
the distinguished chairwoman on the 
Ways and Means Committee, which was 
largely responsible, along with ROSA 
DELAURO, 
RICHIE
NEAL
and 
MIKE 
THOMPSON in getting all this done—the 
point is, we will be having a further 
discussion about this bill as we move 
forward to its passage in the next 24, 48 
hours. 
It is important to acknowledge on 
International Women’s Day the con-
nection between the advancement of 
women, the recognition of the con-
tributions of women, and the needs 
that are met in the American Rescue 
Plan. 
As President Biden said, help is on 
the way. That promise is kept in this 
legislation to all Americans. I wanted 
to acknowledge specifically the women 
of America. 
f 
VETERANS NEED VACCINES 
(Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I join Madam Speaker in cele-
brating International Women’s Day. 
Today, I rise in support of the VA 
VACCINES Act. This is a bipartisan 
bill that will expand the VA’s ability 
to provide COVID–19 vaccines to all 
veterans and their caregivers, regard-
less of whether or not they are enrolled 
in the VA healthcare system. 
Mr. Speaker, the VA should not turn 
away any veteran who wants this life-
saving vaccine. You know, where I live 
in Florida—and I am sure it is like this 
in most places—it is still like playing 
the lottery to get a vaccine. 
This vaccine is free to all Americans 
and is paid for by our tax dollars. So, 
in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, for our 
veterans who have selflessly served our

EQUALITY ACT DESTROYS 
WOMEN’S RIGHTS 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, on International Women’s Day, I 
would like to discuss the Equality Act. 
The Equality Act has completely de-
stroyed women’s rights. It has taken 
away women’s rights in sports. It has 
completely canceled women, and I 
think it is a terrible thing that has 
happened to the women in America 
who have come so far. 
Our 
grandmothers 
and 
mothers 
worked so hard to achieve our rights, 
and now with the passage of the Equal-
ity Act, they have put men in our little 
girls’ bathrooms, sports locker rooms, 
playing fields, and seem to care less 
about women’s rights whatsoever. 
They have also completely destroyed 
religious freedoms and violated our 
freedoms and rights in every single 
way. 
The Equality Act is atrocious and 
evil. It completely erases gender. God 
created us male and female in His 
image. He created us. 
Women deserve their rights. We de-
serve our sports. We deserve our pri-
vacy and should not have the invasion 
of biological men in any of these areas.

RECOGNIZING JEANNETTE RANKIN 
ON INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
this international day of women, I re-
mind everyone that the first Member of 
this body who was a woman was 
Jeannette Rankin. 
She was elected from the State of 
Montana in 1916 and again in 1940. She 
served us well; she served us admi-
rably. 
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to remind ev-
eryone that my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle do not have a monop-
oly on having women represent them.

tleman from California is recognized

Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
for the purpose of debate only, I yield 
the customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota, pending 
which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
today, the Committee on Rules met 
and reported House Resolution 188, pro-
viding structured rules for consider-
ation of H.R. 842, H.R. 8, and H.R. 1446. 
For H.R. 842, the rule self-executes a 
manager’s amendment by Chairman 
SCOTT, makes in order 19 amendments, 
and provides for 1 hour of debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair 
and the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
For H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, the rule 
makes in order eight and four amend-
ments, respectively, and provides 1 
hour of debate for each bill equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking member of the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
The rule further provides en bloc au-
thority and a motion to recommit for 
each bill. 
The rule also adds an additional mi-
nority member to the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis. 
Finally, the rule provides for recess 
instructions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority from March 13 
through April 22, and activates the 
Consensus Calendar. 
Madam Speaker, this is the first time 
I have been able to be on the floor and 
present in almost a year. A year ago, 
as some of you know, I had an accident 
and proceeded to spend 6 weeks in the 
George Washington University Hos-
pital intensive care unit, 4 of those 
weeks on a ventilator. 
My sons came from California to be 
told by the doctors in a windowless 
room at George Washington that I had 
about a 10 percent chance of survival. 
The next day, they got a phone call, ex-
pecting to hear that their dad had died. 
Instead, the doctor told them that I 
was doing better. 
Madam Speaker, I know that you 
know how grateful we are to have the 
wonderful gift of life, to share it with 
our children, and to be here in this 
sanctum sanctorum of American de-
mocracy. I am grateful. I am grateful 
to my staff, to the providence of our 
creator, and to my family. 
Madam Speaker, our Nation is strug-
gling, and not only because of the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Our 
Nation 
needs bold, meaningful changes to 
make a real difference for average 
Americans. That is what the three bills 
before us today do. Each addresses its 
own epidemic: gun violence; inequality; 
and, unfortunately, an ugly part of 
human nature, greed. 
Madam Speaker, nearly 40,000 people 
died from firearm injuries in the 
United States in 2019. History would 
show that enacting smart, evidence- 
based policies based on public health 
premises reduces this sad phenomenon. 
Madam Speaker, 22 percent of U.S. 
gun owners acquired their most recent 
firearm without a background check. 
That means that millions of Americans 
got millions of guns with no questions 
asked. Approximately 80 percent of all 
firearms acquired for criminal purposes 
are obtained through private party 
transfers, which currently do not re-
quire background checks. 
b 1615 
Ninety-six percent of the inmates 
surveyed, who were prohibited from 
possessing a firearm at the time they 
committed their crime, had obtained 
their firearm from an unlicensed pri-
vate seller, avoiding the background 
check altogether. 
In California, where I am proud to 
live and serve, all private gun sales 
must be completed through a licensed 
firearms dealer, requiring a back-
ground check—a universal background 
check and a mandatory waiting period. 
Not 
coincidentally—and 
the 
public 
health experts will let us know through 
their 
evidence-based 
research—Cali-
fornia has the ninth-lowest rate of gun 
violence across the United States. Gun 
killings in Connecticut, similarly, fell 
by 40 percent after it required a manda-
tory background check and a gun safe-
ty course before the purchase of a gun.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1088 
March 8, 2021 
We know what we need to do to help 
protect millions of Americans. Uni-
versal background checks are sup-
ported by decades of evidence. The Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act, H.R. 
8, 
institutes 
universal 
background 
checks. 
Additionally, the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act, H.R. 1446, ends the 
arbitrary rule that if a background 
check hasn’t been completed in 3 days, 
the gun can be sold regardless. 
I proudly support these bills because 
the evidence is clear that they will 
make our communities safer and save 
lives. 
Madam Speaker, next, the rule will 
allow us to consider the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act, or the PRO Act. 
The rise in inequality in this country 
has coincided with a decline in union 
membership. By most estimates, de-
clining 
unionization 
accounted 
for 
about one-third of the increase in in-
equality—one-third—from 1980 through 
the 1990s through today. 
If you watch the data over the years, 
as States move as a group toward less 
union coverage, those same States 
have much worse income inequality. 
You cannot address inequality without 
increasing access for working people to 
representation. Unions do not only 
raise wages for the workers they rep-
resent, but they have also been shown 
to moderate the compensation of ex-
ecutives. 
On top of the obvious benefits you 
think of that are associated with the 
labor unions, like higher wages, safer 
workplaces, some of the others that 
come along with union membership 
also help address the inequities in our 
society. 
Union workers are more likely to re-
ceive paid leave, are up to 28 percent 
more likely to have employer-spon-
sored health insurance, and are up to 54 
percent more likely to be enrolled in 
employer-sponsored pensions. Not only 
do workers have better access to pen-
sions, but their employers contribute 
an average of 28 percent more toward 
those pensions, retirement security for 
Americans, than nonunion employers. 
As the chairman of the subcommittee 
of jurisdiction, I know that the PRO 
Act simply updates labor law to ensure 
that workers in today’s economy are 
able to create and join labor unions to 
receive the same kinds of protections 
they see in other sectors. Nothing 
more. 
As President Eisenhower once said 
during the largest expansion of the 
American economy in history, when 
labor unions had one-third of the work-
force: ‘‘Only a fool would try to deprive 
working men and women of the right 
to join the union of their choice.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from California for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I am also happy to see him back 
doing well. I appreciate that, and that 
we are here in the Chamber together. 
Madam Speaker, we are here consid-
ering the rule for three controversial, 
divisive bills being moved forward by 
the majority with very little input 
from Republicans or the millions of 
Americans these bills will affect. Two 
of these bills are highly controversial 
gun control bills that undermine the 
constitutional right to bear arms. 
H.R. 8, the so-called universal back-
ground check bill, would criminalize 
the private transfer of firearms. Com-
bined with the restrictions already 
placed on private transfers during the 
pandemic, this makes it impossible for 
law-abiding gun owners to acquire or 
even borrow or lend firearms. 
Universal background checks do not 
stop criminals. In fact, the majority of 
the criminals in State and Federal 
prisons who used a firearm during their 
offense got that firearm by stealing it, 
taking it from a family member or 
friend, or just an underground market. 
In 2013, the Department of Justice’s 
National 
Institute 
of 
Justice 
re-
searched universal background checks 
and determined that they would not be 
effective without additional restric-
tions on firearms. 
The other gun control bill, the 
Charleston loophole bill, would permit 
the Federal Government to delay a 
firearm transfer indefinitely without 
any proof that the person is ineligible 
to possess a firearm. This bill under-
mines the ability for Americans to le-
gally purchase a firearm, as it subjects 
firearm dealers to the mercy of the 
Federal bureaucracy. 
Before we jump straight to this kind 
of constitutional overreach, it is im-
portant to remember that gun control 
legislation isn’t going to stop criminals 
from gaining access to guns. 
In the rural district I represent, 
many of my constituents are hunters, 
sportsmen, and law-abiding gun owners 
who utilize their Second Amendment 
rights. These bills undermine their 
ability to do so, and flies in the face of 
unity that has been promised by the 
President and Democrats. 
Lastly, we are considering a bill that 
amounts to a union boss wish list that 
the majority is pushing, circumventing 
regular order and without input from 
the minority. 
Madam Speaker, labor law must 
strike a balance—a careful balance be-
tween labor unions’ rights to organize 
and employers’ abilities to respond to 
these efforts. However, the PRO Act, a 
monumental rewrite of Federal labor 
law, will massively tip the scales in 
favor of unions, leaving employers and 
small businesses with massive costs 
and burdensome or vague legal stand-
ards. 
Among the most egregious, a section 
of this bill is applying a one-size-fits- 
all standard for union contracts, ren-
dering the franchise industry com-
pletely unviable by imposing a burden-
some joint-employer Obama rule and 
requiring the disclosure of private in-
formation of employees to union orga-
nizers without their consent. 
My great home State has a proud his-
tory of supporting organized labor, and 
I support employees’ right to collective 
bargaining. However, this legislation 
before us today represents a misguided 
and unbalanced approached to labor 
law. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to think twice before sup-
porting these bills that could perma-
nently alter our job market and threat-
en our constitutional rights. I urge op-
position to this rule, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the 
distinguished chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I am so glad he is back. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in 
support of the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act, or the PRO Act. 
I am the daughter of a garment 
worker. So the fight for workers’ rights 
has always had a special place in my 
heart. My mother toiled and worked 
every single day in the sweatshops in 
New Haven, Connecticut, sewing shirt 
collars and dresses. She was piecework, 
which meant she got pennies on the 
dollar. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, and Related Agencies, I 
work every day to ensure that her 
early struggles were not in vain. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of the PRO Act, introduced by the 
chair of the Committee, Congressman 
BOBBY SCOTT. It strengthens the right 
of working people to come together in 
unions to secure better wages and bet-
ter working conditions. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has further 
exposed the single biggest economic 
challenge of our times, which is that 
people’s pay does not keep up with the 
rising costs of healthcare, education, 
and childcare. 
And from 1980 to 2017, average in-
comes for the bottom 90 percent of 
households stagnated to a 1.1 percent 
increase, 
while 
skyrocketing 
more 
than 180 percent for the wealthiest 1 
percent in this country. It is no coinci-
dence that at the same time, union 
membership fell for a record low to 10 
percent. 
Economists at Princeton found that 
the alarming rise of income inequality 
since the 1970s can be at least partially 
attributed to the decline in union 
membership. 
The PRO Act is about leveling the 
playing field for working people. It 
would directly address the issues facing 
workers across the entire economy and 
give equal access to the collective bar-
gaining process. In sum, it would en-
sure workers’ rights keep pace with the 
new economy. 
As Nobel prize winning economist Jo-
seph Stiglitz has said: ‘‘Inequality is 
not inevitable. It is about the public 
policy 
choices 
we 
make, 
not 
globalization, not technology.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1089 
March 8, 2021 
Madam Speaker, we have the oppor-
tunity today to choose a public policy 
that, in fact, will defend and protect 
working people in this country. Pass 
the PRO Act. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), 
my good friend and colleague from the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
FISCHBACH for yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today makes in order two pieces of leg-
islation that this Chamber already con-
sidered last Congress. I am incredibly 
disappointed, yet once again, that we 
are considering legislation that makes 
it harder for law-abiding citizens to ex-
ercise their Second Amendment rights, 
but does nothing, nothing at all, to ad-
dress the root cause of gun violence. 
Despite what the majority claims, 
these bills would not have prevented 
any recent, high-profile mass shoot-
ings. These bills would not have pre-
vented criminals from obtaining fire-
arms. The overwhelming majority of 
criminals who commit crimes or are in 
possession of a firearm, they commit 
those crimes with firearms that were 
acquired through theft, the under-
ground market, or straw purchases; 
and these are already illegal. Nothing 
in these bills would stop criminals 
from continuing to break the law. 
Instead, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 would 
make it harder for domestic violence 
victims to protect themselves. It would 
give unelected bureaucrats the power 
to indefinitely delay legal gun pur-
chases. It could even be used to create 
a national gun registry. 
If you don’t believe me, the Obama 
administration even said that uni-
versal background checks are unwork-
able unless you have a national reg-
istry. But let’s just get back to the 
text. 
As we pointed out last Congress, H.R. 
8 is so poorly drafted that a transfer of 
a firearm to another person during a 
life-threatening emergency could land 
somebody in jail. That is how poorly 
this is drafted. So, again, these bills do 
nothing except penalize law-abiding 
citizens. 
You know, I learned to shoot from 
my grandfather. I was very young and 
learned how to shoot in Westmoreland 
County, Pennsylvania. Guns and fire-
arms are very important to me and to 
a lot of my constituents. I can attest 
and I can assure you that the vast ma-
jority of gun owners are hardworking, 
law-abiding citizens looking to protect 
their families, looking to hunt and 
shoot with their friends. 
b 1630 
But my colleagues on the left would 
be 
wise 
to 
just 
stop 
their 
grandstanding and focus on solutions 
that have been proven to work, like 
improving law enforcement coordina-
tion, increasing information sharing, 
and giving authorities more resources 
to actually prevent, deter, and pros-
ecute firearm violence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule, vote 
‘‘no’’ on H.R. 8, and vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 
1446. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD an article pub-
lished in the March 3 USA Today ti-
tled: ‘‘Congress renews gun safety push 
with background check bills.’’ 
[From USA TODAY, Mar. 3, 2021] 
CONGRESS RENEWS GUN SAFETY PUSH WITH 
BACKGROUND CHECK BILLS 
(By Amanda Becker) 
Congressional lawmakers this week re-
vived an effort to enact significant gun safe-
ty laws for the first time in more than 25 
years by introducing bills to establish a uni-
versal background check system that has 
broad support from the public. 
The bills introduced Tuesday in the House 
and Senate would extend current federal 
background check requirements to trans-
actions conducted by unlicensed and private 
sellers. 
Legislation was reintroduced in Congress 
to extend background checks to transactions 
conducted by private and unlicensed gun 
sellers. 
The gun safety group Giffords estimates 
that 22% of U.S. gun owners purchased their 
last firearm without completing a back-
ground check. Polling shows that more than 
90% of Americans support a universal back-
ground check system. 
The measures are what gun safety advo-
cates predicted would be a first step in pur-
suing new gun laws now that Democrats con-
trol the White House and both chambers of 
Congress. In recent years, gun safety bills 
stalled even when they had bipartisan public 
support, in part because Republican Majority 
Leader Mitch McConnell did not bring them 
up for votes when he led the Senate from 2015 
to 2021. 
Rep. Mike Thompson, a California Demo-
crat who chairs a congressional gun violence 
prevention task force, on Tuesday reintro-
duced bipartisan House legislation that 
would require background checks for all fire-
arm sales. The House first passed the bill in 
2019, one year after a mass shooting at Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas High School in Park-
land, Florida, left 17 dead. 
‘‘Time and time again, we have seen that 
the American people want universal back-
ground checks, in fact public polling shows 
that the majority of people, Democrats, Re-
publicans and independents, support this,’’ 
Thompson said in a statement. 
The Senate is evenly split between Demo-
crats and Republicans, and the measure 
would have to pick up bipartisan support to 
pass that chamber given that most legisla-
tion must clear a 60-vote threshold. 
‘‘This Congress we will finally bring com-
mon sense gun reforms up for a vote in the 
House and the Senate, and the single most 
popular and effective proposal we can con-
sider is universal background checks,’’ Mur-
phy said in a video about the effort. 
When the House passed background checks 
legislation in 2019, the bill ran aground in 
the 
then 
Republican-controlled 
Senate, 
where McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, 
did not bring it up for a vote. 
‘‘Now, with Senate Democrats in the Ma-
jority, we have the opportunity to act on 
this overwhelmingly popular, lifesaving leg-
islation to protect American communities,’’ 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said 
in a statement on the bill’s introduction. 
Advocates for new gun safety laws have 
hoped that with President Joe Biden in the 
White House and Democrats controlling the 
House and Senate, there is an opportunity 
for action. The NRA is also grappling with 
multiple crises: New York’s attorney general 
is investigating whether its leaders mis-
appropriated more than $60 million for per-
sonal use, and the NRA filed for bankruptcy 
in January. Its remaining officials insist the 
organization remains solvent, and it plans to 
reincorporate in Texas. 
‘‘This is the moment,’’ said Shannon 
Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, 
a grassroots organization started in late 2012 
that now has nearly 6 million supporters. 
‘‘We have a trifecta and they have a man-
date to act on this. We have a grassroots 
army to support them and the NRA is weak-
er than they’ve ever been,’’ she added. 
Already this week, Rep. Jim Clyburn, a 
key Biden ally from South Carolina, reintro-
duced a bill that would close the so-called 
‘‘Charleston loophole’’ that allows firearm 
purchases to move forward after three busi-
ness days, even if a background check has 
not been completed. It is named for the 2015 
mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Caro-
lina, where nine died after the gunman was 
able to purchase a firearm when the three- 
day window expired. 
Last month, to mark the third anniversary 
of the Parkland shooting, Biden called for 
the passage of ‘‘common sense’’ gun safety 
laws. He cited a background checks bill 
among his top priorities. 
The last major law passed to curb gun vio-
lence was the Federal Assault Weapons Ban 
enacted by Democratic President Bill Clin-
ton in 1994. But even that had a 10-year sun-
set provision that has since expired. Several 
attempts to renew it, including by President 
Barack Obama in 2013 after Sandy Hook, all 
derailed in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
Groups pushing for gun safety measures 
told The 19th earlier this year that a back-
ground check bill would probably be the 
starting point early in the Biden administra-
tion because it has broader bipartisan sup-
port than other measures. President Donald 
Trump acknowledged in 2019 that there was 
a ‘‘great appetite’’ for such a proposal after 
mass shootings in Ohio and Texas, as did 
McConnell, though he did not go on to bring 
it up for a vote. 
A ‘‘red flag’’ bill giving courts the power to 
temporarily confiscate firearms from indi-
viduals deemed at risk or anti-gun traf-
ficking legislation could be taken up next, 
the advocates said. 
Biden advisers Susan Rice and Cedric Rich-
mond met last month with gun safety groups 
that included Everytown for Gun Safety, 
Moms Demand Action, Giffords and Brady to 
discuss background checks, the proliferation 
of so-called ‘‘ghost’’ guns (homemade fire-
arms or those with serial numbers removed) 
and violence intervention programs, the 
White House said. 
Biden has also pledged to work with Con-
gress to reauthorize the Violence Against 
Women Act, which he worked on as a senator 
in the 1990s. In 2019, the House approved a 
VAWA provision to close the so-called ‘‘boy-
friend loophole’’ that allows current and 
former unmarried partners convicted of 
abuse and stalking to continue to purchase 
firearms. That effort also stalled in the Sen-
ate. Democratic House leaders said this week 
they will be taking up VAWA reauthoriza-
tion later this month. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
more than 90 percent of Americans sup-
port a universal background check sys-
tem. Passing this legislation is simply 
common sense, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

March 8, 2021 
the 26th District of Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS), who is another one of my col-
leagues on the Rules Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for the time. 
Madam Speaker, I am concerned 
about H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act, that is part of this 
rule. This bill would eliminate the 3- 
day waiting period for a National In-
stant Criminal Background Check sys-
tem determination. Under current law, 
if no determination is made within 3 
days, a firearms sale may proceed. This 
bill that will be before Congress this 
week would expand the 3 days to re-
quire a 10-business-day waiting period 
with an additional 10 days allowed for 
the Attorney General to process any 
petitions. 
But rather than eliminate the 3-day 
waiting period, we should be removing 
from commerce those firearms that are 
sold to individuals who are later found 
to be ineligible. 
In 2016 the Department of Justice In-
spector General audit found that less 
than 1 percent of those who were sold a 
firearm and then found later to be in-
eligible through the delayed back-
ground check were investigated and 
prosecuted. 
According to a 2018 Government Ac-
countability Office report, the FBI con-
ducted just over 25 million firearm 
background checks through the NICS 
system that year. One percent of at-
tempted purchases were denied, or 
about 181,000. If only 1 percent of those 
denials were investigated, that still 
leaves 179,000 NICS denials where an in-
dividual may have been inappropri-
ately sold a firearm, but, in fact, were 
never investigated. Even one firearm 
illegally in commerce, unfortunately, 
can lead to tragedy. 
Rather than place further burdens on 
law-abiding gun owners, we should be 
investigating and prosecuting those 
who have obtained a firearm illegally. 
Enforcement of our existing laws would 
be the first step to preventing gun vio-
lence. 
During rules consideration, I sub-
mitted an amendment to H.R. 1446 to 
require the Department of Justice In-
spector General to report to Congress 
on the number of NICS denials referred 
for investigation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Texas an ad-
ditional 15 seconds. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for the time. 
Madam Speaker, this will provide an 
accurate accounting of the inefficien-
cies in the NICS system and provide a 
starting point to ensure full enforce-
ment of our laws. 
I was pleased that this amendment 
was made in order, and I hope all Mem-
bers will support it when it comes to 
the floor for a vote. 
But the underlying bill, H.R. 1446, 
should not pass this House. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I agree with my col-
league and friend on the Rules Com-
mittee that we should enforce existing 
laws. In States like California where 
we have universal background checks, 
we have seen that gun violence has 
gone down, as I said in my earlier re-
marks. We have also seen that 30 per-
cent of the guns used in criminal activ-
ity are actually imported into the 
State from other States. 
To the previous comments that we 
need a national standard, that is why 
we need a national standard. It doesn’t 
mean that States like California, Con-
necticut, and Massachusetts can’t do 
these things, and it is a good labora-
tory, as Justice Brandeis said, that 
States should be the laboratory for in-
novation. We know these things work. 
So I would agree that we should en-
force and get the revenue, the existing 
law. 
But clearly, eliminating the back-
ground checks loophole would help 
make Americans safe. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the Fifth District of Oklahoma 
(Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to the combined rule and to the 
underlying measures, including H.R. 
842, the PRO Act. 
We find ourselves today, Madam 
Speaker, at a time when businesses are 
struggling just to stay afloat, and in 
many States, unemployment numbers 
remain high. The last thing Congress 
should be doing at a time like this is 
making it harder for workers to find 
good employment. 
But that is just what the PRO Act 
would do. It cuts the opportunity for 
employers to make decisions based on 
what is right for their businesses, 
takes away the freedom of choice for 
workers who want to keep more of 
their paychecks, and makes it impos-
sible for entrepreneurs to operate as 
independent contractors. 
Proponents of this bill don’t want 
you to know that the so-called ABC 
test, based off a flawed California State 
law and used in this bill to define em-
ployment, would essentially abolish 
independent contracting and upend the 
gig economy. 
There is a reason that in the last few 
decades 27 States, including my home 
State of Oklahoma, have passed right- 
to-work laws. We the people want free-
dom in the marketplace, not a bill that 
does the bidding for union bosses. I im-
plore my colleagues to oppose this bill 
and instead focus on solutions that 
make it easier for Americans to find 
good jobs in the economy. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, the bottom line is this rule would 
advance unconstitutional legislation 
that undermines the Second Amend-
ment for law-abiding citizens. It is 
amazing that lawful gun ownership has 
been so politicized by the left that it is 
now common to ask someone their po-
sition on the Second Amendment, as if 
our constitutional rights are subject to 
opinion. 
The question before us is not: Do we 
believe in gun rights? It is rather: Do 
we believe in the Constitution? 
Currently, any firearm purchase from 
a federally licensed dealer is subject to 
a background check. But this legisla-
tion would expand this system—along 
with the fees and bureaucracy that 
comes with it—to private transfers. 
For what other constitutional rights 
will we now assign a fee or a tax? 
Our First Amendment rights? 
Our Fifth Amendment rights? 
This bill creates a de facto gun reg-
istry by involving the Federal Govern-
ment in every gun transfer, including 
private transfers and gifts. 
How else would we enforce these re-
quirements? 
For my Democrat friends who sug-
gest that Conservatives and gun own-
ers are paranoid about a national reg-
istry, Madam Speaker, you bet we are. 
We know our history, and we know 
what has happened in other countries. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose this rule 
and all three of these bills. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
was hoping when I flew back last night 
that the fence would be gone from 
around the Capitol. Unfortunately, it is 
still there. But given the bills we have 
before us today, maybe it is only fit-
ting when you look at the Capitol you 
see a fence around it. It makes the Cap-
itol appear as if it is a capital of a 
more totalitarian state looking at the 
bills we have before us today. 
The first bill is H.R. 8, the Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act. They call this 
an assault on the Second Amendment, 
something our forefathers put in the 
Constitution because they knew that 
the power in this country has to rest 
with the people. Instead, we have a bill 
here making it much more difficult to 
transfer a firearm and putting one in a 
position where they could face prison 
or a $100,000 fine if they do something 
wrong. 
It is just beyond belief. It is hard to 
believe when you look at this bill, 
Madam Speaker, that until 4 years ago 
when they began a war on the police, 
the murder rate in this country had 
fallen over 20 years in a row. Unfortu-
nately, the majority is going to try to 
make it much more difficult to trans-
fer a firearm as well as create a situa-
tion when you are waiting for your 
NICS check, if the FBI doesn’t get back 
to you, you are delayed in getting a 
firearm.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1091 
March 8, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge rejection of 
the rule. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I have one com-
ment. The idea of opinions in the inter-
pretation of the Second Amendment, 
there are 13 States, as I understand it, 
right now, who have universal back-
ground checks. All of them are working 
consistent with upholding the Second 
Amendment. Californians who have a 
universal background check can go out 
and legally buy a gun. It just decreases 
the number of deaths and injuries when 
you have this kind of law, Madam 
Speaker. 
So I agree with the gentleman who 
spoke and said it shouldn’t be about 
opinion. Neither of us decides what is 
constitutional in this instance. The 
courts do, and the courts have allowed 
local and State governments to imple-
ment these commonsense laws. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the First District of Iowa (Mrs. 
HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to the rule. I think we can all 
agree that guns should not be allowed 
to fall into the wrong hands. But these 
bills do nothing to stop the bad guys 
from illegally purchasing guns or re-
duce gun violence meaningfully. In-
stead, they punish law-abiding gun 
owners and arbitrarily deny Iowans 
their Second Amendment rights. 
H.R. 1446 allows the government to 
delay the sale of a firearm for an in-
definite amount of time. H.R. 8 in-
fringes on the rights of law-abiding gun 
owners, criminalizing everyday trans-
fers of guns between friends, family, 
and neighbors, including lending of 
weapons that were obtained lawfully. 
Madam Speaker, these bills trample 
on the constitutional rights of Iowans, 
and I strongly oppose them. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
a correction. The bill doesn’t say in-
definitely for the background checks. 
It says 10 days with the availability of 
an additional 10 days for a maximum of 
20 days. So it is not indefinite. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the Third District of Florida 
(Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to this rule as 
well as H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, a/k/a the 
legislation to deny Americans their 
Second Amendment rights. 
Common sense and data tell us that 
these bills will do nothing to prevent 
criminals from obtaining firearms or 
stop mass shootings in the United 
States. Instead, these bills will make it 
more difficult for law-abiding citizens 
to exercise their constitutionally pro-
tected rights. 
H.R. 8 would lead to a national gun 
registry which every American should 
be 
concerned 
about. 
Even 
former 
Obama officials acknowledge that uni-
versal background checks are only ef-
fective with a national registry in 
place. H.R. 1446 would lead to unneces-
sary and potentially indefinite delays 
in law-abiding citizens purchasing the 
tools necessary to defend their families 
and their homes. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle claim that H.R. 1446 would 
close a loophole, but we know the 
truth. The only loophole will be that 
the criminals will continue to get guns 
on the black market while lawful citi-
zens are denied their rights. 
As Members of Congress we swore an 
oath to defend the Constitution, and 
that includes the Second Amendment; 
and it reads plainly: shall not be in-
fringed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand up for all Americans’ 
rights to bear arms, uphold their con-
stitutional oath, and reject this rule 
and these horrendous bills. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I would just like to point out 
that having a gun in your home actu-
ally makes you more likely to be a vic-
tim of gun violence. 
Of the over 40,000 Americans who lost 
their lives from gun violence in 2018— 
the last year we have up-to-date statis-
tics—two-thirds of those were by sui-
cide. This is one of the big contributing 
factors to what are the so-called dis-
eases of despair which happen every-
where in this country right now in 
these difficult times, and it has gotten 
worse under COVID. But the proximity 
to the guns actually leads to more of 
an opportunity for people to be the vic-
tim of gun violence. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a February 18 Washington Post 
editorial titled: ‘‘Maryland just closed 
a gun loophole. The state is safer for 
it.’’ 
[From The Washington Post, Feb. 18, 2021] 
MARYLAND JUST CLOSED A GUN LOOPHOLE. 
THE STATE IS SAFER FOR IT. 
(By Editorial Board) 
Given America’s lurid history of gun vio-
lence, it is confounding that buyers can pur-
chase firearms in some places without back-
ground checks. It’s even more astonishing 
that it remains the case in a liberal strong-
hold such as Maryland, which suffered its 
own recent trauma owing to a deranged gun-
man bent on mass murder. 
Lawmakers in Annapolis last week finally 
closed a loophole in state law that waived 
background checks for buyers who make pri-
vate purchases of shotguns and rifles. Sales 
of handguns as well as shotguns and rifles 
from licensed dealers in Maryland have long 
been subject to mandatory checks through a 
federal database, but long guns were exempt-
ed when the transaction took place through 
private dealers, including those at gun 
shows. 
The 
Democratic-controlled 
legislature 
pushed through the change this month by 
overriding a gratuitous veto cast last year 
by Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, who 
made no public argument to defend the loop-
hole beyond the fact that he had not pro-
posed closing it. The change takes effect 
next month. 
Gun rights advocates and their Republican 
allies in the legislature characterized the 
legislation as an assault on rural Maryland’s 
way of life and a burden for hunters. In fact, 
whatever (probably slight) inconvenience 
some sportsmen might undergo because of 
the new law is outweighed by the obstacle it 
may pose for buyers who have no business 
owning firearms. 
It does not take a feat of imagination to 
foresee an act of gun violence carried out by 
someone who, stymied by a background 
check conducted by a licensed dealer, turns 
to a private seller instead. Less than three 
years ago, a gunman nursing a grievance 
massacred five people and injured two others 
on a rampage through the newsroom of the 
Capital Gazette newspaper, in Annapolis. He 
used a shotgun. As it happens, he passed a 
background check when he purchased it; a 
previous conviction, in 2011, for criminal har-
assment, was a misdemeanor, not serious 
enough to forbid the sale. Yet even if he had 
been convicted of a felony, he might still 
have obtained a weapon easily by seeking 
out a private dealer—through an online in-
quiry, for instance. The chances that such a 
gunman would now succeed are diminished 
in Maryland. 
No legislative measure is foolproof, and 
none will reliably defeat a determined gun-
man. The idea of gun control, rather, is to 
build a matrix of laws that deter and detect 
individuals who, were they to obtain a fire-
arm, would pose a threat to themselves or 
others. Maryland’s new law advances that 
cause. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
this isn’t about taking away the rights 
of 
law-abiding 
Americans. 
Those 
claims are nonsense. This is about pro-
tecting the lives of all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
the Ninth District of Georgia (Mr. 
CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the rule pro-
viding combined consideration for H.R. 
8, H.R. 1446, and H.R. 842. 
I want to focus on the first two. That 
is where Democrats are peddling their 
dangerous gun control agenda under 
the guise of working to stem the tide of 
firearms used in crime and under the 
guise of helping make our communities 
safer. These Democratic efforts are 
part of their larger radical and shame-
ful ploy to slowly chip away at the Sec-
ond Amendment rights of law-abiding 
citizens. 
As a Federal firearms dealer by 
trade, I remain staunchly opposed to 
any effort that abridges our God-given 
Second Amendment right to keep and 
bear arms—those inalienable rights 
recognized by the Constitution. 
b 1645 
If enacted, H.R. 8 will criminalize 
many common and often necessary 
firearm transfers between law-abiding 
citizens while not reducing criminals’ 
access to guns at all. I predict we will

illegal possession or transfer of a fire-
arm than we will violent gang members 
or criminals. 
How on Earth will criminalizing 
moms and pops curtail firearms used in 
a crime? The answer is that it won’t. 
My Democrat colleagues are naive to 
think that criminals are suddenly 
going to rush to the closest firearms 
dealer to buy a gun. I know. 
Even more egregious than H.R. 8 is 
H.R. 1446, as it not only sets up a proc-
ess by which American citizens would 
have to petition the government to ex-
ercise their right to bear arms, but it 
also extends the amount of time before 
a dealer can legally transfer a pur-
chased firearm. 
Current law provides a 3-business-day 
safety valve to ensure the government 
doesn’t further infringe on the cus-
tomer’s constitutional rights, and that 
must not be extended. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and 
‘‘no’’ on the underlying bills. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to point out to my friends 
and colleagues that, again, even Jus-
tice Scalia, in the Heller majority deci-
sion, said that local and State govern-
ments could enact reasonable gun vio-
lence protection laws. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Alabama’s 
Second 
District 
(Mr. 
MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, if enacted, H.R. 8 would turn 
law-abiding citizens into criminals in 
the name of preventing crime. 
H.R. 8 would establish universal 
background checks that aren’t uni-
versal at all, nor would we have pre-
vented any of the recent crimes involv-
ing firearms. The criminals involved 
either passed a Federal background 
check or stole the firearms they used. 
This should prove that background 
checks aren’t the problem. 
This bill doesn’t stop at the transfer 
of firearms, but it also requires back-
ground checks for temporary transfers 
of possession. Under this bill, simply 
handing a gun to someone could result 
in a penalty of up to 1 year in prison 
and a $100,000 fine. 
For example, this weekend, my son 
brought some of his friends over to the 
house to shoot skeet, and one of the 
young men borrowed my gun. So now, 
are we criminals when we loan a young 
man a gun for learning to shoot skeet? 
I don’t understand how in the world 
we are going to start to criminalize ev-
eryday activities in this country. 
We are talking about a waiting pe-
riod. Remember, when we got this 
mask, they told us 2 weeks to flatten 
the curve? We are a little over a year 
now. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Tennessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER). 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the attempts to take away our Second 
Amendment rights. 
As a gun owner myself, I am a strong 
supporter of the Second Amendment, 
and for me, this support is personal. 
Years ago, myself and my employees 
were held at gunpoint in my own phar-
macy. Fortunately, we all made it out 
safe. Do you want to know why we 
made it out safe? Because we had a gun 
as well. 
But I know we were more fortunate 
than most who have a similar experi-
ence. I have utilized my gun carry per-
mit ever since. 
I believe Americans should have the 
right to defend themselves like I did. 
This experience is just one reason why 
I oppose attempts to weaken our right 
to carry. 
Without 
our 
Second 
Amendment 
rights, we undermine our own rights to 
self-defense for ourselves, our busi-
nesses, and our families. This would be 
a terrible mistake, to try to take away 
our inalienable right to self-defense. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will join me in opposing any 
legislation that threatens our Second 
Amendment rights, including H.R. 8 
and H.R. 1446. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Just a brief comment. In that same 
decision of Justice Scalia that I men-
tioned earlier, he said that Second 
Amendment protections are not unlim-
ited, and that is the point of this bill. 
They have been done. They have been 
done constitutionally, as I said, by 13 
States. And they statistically work. 
I, too, have been robbed at gunpoint, 
but I didn’t have to have a gun to sur-
vive. That was providence and the San 
Francisco Police Department. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, if 
we defeat the previous question, I will 
offer an amendment to the rule to pro-
vide for consideration of Congress-
woman HINSON’s bill, H.R. 682, the Re-
open Schools Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
materials, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, pro-
vides a safe and responsible path for-
ward to reopen our schools and to get 
our students back in the classroom. 
To speak further on the bill, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. HINSON), my colleague. 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota for yielding the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as a 
voice for the thousands of students 
across this country who have not 
stepped foot in a classroom or on a 
playground for over a year. 
In Iowa, our Governor has put stu-
dents’ education, their mental health, 
and their safety first. Our schools have 
reopened safely in Iowa. 
My kids got on a school bus this 
morning and went to a classroom, and 
they rode that same school bus home. 
They got to play with their friends. 
They got to learn in a classroom. 
Schools nationwide have to have a 
plan to reopen before it is too late for 
our students. The mental health toll of 
long-term school closures on our stu-
dents is staggering. Recent data shows 
that mental healthcare claims for chil-
dren ages 13–18—these are our teen-
agers, our next generation—have dou-
bled over the past year, according to 
that data. 
Emergency room doctors are saying 
that they are treating more and more 
young people in crisis than ever before. 
Now, it is being reported that students 
across the country have fallen off the 
grid. That is right. We don’t know 
where they are. School districts can’t 
find them. 
As weeks out of school have turned 
into months, and months have turned 
into a year, our kids are the ones who 
are falling through the cracks, aca-
demically, 
emotionally, 
and 
phys-
ically. 
Thousands of our youngest, most vul-
nerable Americans are unaccounted 
for. Enrollment is dropping, especially 
in rural areas in States like Iowa. So 
now, 1 year out of the classroom is 
turning into 2, at least. Who knows? 
We must act. We must act today. We 
must act quickly. That is why I intro-
duced the Reopen Schools Act. This 
legislation 
would 
ensure 
that 
our 
school districts are using money that 
was appropriated from this body, $54 
billion of it, on proven safety measures 
that will allow them to reopen safely 
as soon as possible and have a plan to 
do so. 
Throwing more and more money at 
this problem, and then letting it go un-
used, is truly a disservice to taxpayers, 
and it is an injustice to our students. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in standing with our 
kids by defeating the previous ques-
tion. It is an important issue for our 
next generation. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
On the last point, I would just say 
that in California, in particular, in my 
district, having had multiple conversa-
tions with teachers, their labor rep-
resentatives, and superintendents, we 
are getting schools back open, but we 
are doing it in a way to make sure that 
it is done efficiently and safely for ev-
eryone, the students, most particu-
larly, their families, and their teach-
ers. 
We have come so far in this country, 
those of us who have listened to the 
science and the Centers for Disease

Control. We just want to make sure it 
is done right, in the most efficient, ef-
fective way for the kids. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control has indicated schools can 
operate safely with students in the 
classroom, yet many schools across the 
country remain closed. 
President Biden has chosen to side 
with political allies and big labor 
groups over scientists, and our stu-
dents are being denied their right to a 
good education as a result. 
Kids need to be in school, and we 
should follow the science and reopen 
the schools for in-person instruction 
now. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ on the 
previous question and ‘‘no’’ on the un-
derlying measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league. Nicely done. 
First, on the gun bills, of course, we 
are all respectful of the Speaker pro 
tempore’s courage and the experience 
that she has had. For those of us who 
have had family members who have 
lost their lives because of gun vio-
lence—my dad is buried over at Arling-
ton. He is a combat veteran from World 
War II who, a little over 30 years ago, 
took his own life. 
As we know, the tragedies of homi-
cide, as the Speaker pro tempore 
knows personally, and losing a loved 
one, as I know from losing a loved one 
to suicide—suicide is two-thirds of the 
total of people who die—both are awful. 
All we are trying to do, at least in 
my mind, is listen to the research, lis-
ten to the examples of other developed 
countries and other States, and imple-
ment public health policy. It informs 
us that if we do it, we will save lives 
and injuries, and we will save billions 
of dollars that all of us pay for. 
All of us respect the Constitution. We 
took an oath to it. All of us respect the 
Second Amendment. We might not 
have all agreed if we were there, but it 
is the law. The courts have allowed us 
to implement these laws, and they 
work. 
I really don’t understand, and maybe 
it is because of my own personal belief 
and also from my experience as a city 
council member, a mayor, a member of 
the California Legislature, and now in 
Congress, why we don’t follow the re-
search and the evidence that it saves 
lives, out of respect for all those people 
who have lost their lives to gun vio-
lence. 
Then, on the PRO Act, as a former 
member of a Teamsters union, that job 
helped me to get through college when 
my dad had lost his job. I loaded 
trucks. It was that union that provided 
me protection and enough for myself 
and my coworkers. 
When I moved to San Francisco, I 
didn’t have any money. I got a job in a 
hotel restaurant business, and I was in 
that local. Then, I was able to save 
enough money to go open my own busi-
nesses. 
There have been some comments that 
somehow this bill would hurt small 
businesses. The reality is that people 
organize in environments where their 
employer is not treating their employ-
ees appropriately. 
We know the inequality that Ms. 
DELAURO talked about, this historic in-
equality that is strangling our country 
and hurting so many working Ameri-
cans, destroying the middle income 
that we have all benefited from, that 
opportunity to move up and to give to 
our kids something better than we had. 
That is the legacy of this country, and 
labor unions are a big part of that, and 
entrepreneurs and individual business 
owners are a big part of that. But it is 
the balance between these two. 
As John Kenneth Galbraith said a 
long time ago, and he wrote a boring 
book about this, but it is interesting: 
Wages and capital have to have coun-
tervailing institutions. They have to 
balance each other. 
As my friend from Minnesota said, it 
is a balance. Right now, after 50 years 
of attacks, starting with President 
Reagan, the working people in this 
country don’t have the voice they once 
had. That not only hurts them and 
their kids; it hurts all of us. 
When you have a robust middle class, 
and you have workers represented ap-
propriately and proportionately, the 
country grows; there is more money to 
spend in businesses like mine; and 
there is a camaraderie, having team-
work. A good employer knows that, 
whether they have a unionized work-
force or a nonunionized workforce. 
Your employees are what make your 
business work. That is what gives you 
goodwill. That is what Americans took 
so much pride in, in the 1950s and 1960s, 
after World War II, after we had come 
to the great country we were after 
World War II, with a middle class that 
no one has ever seen on this planet. 
Since then, we have eroded that middle 
class. 
The one most important thing to im-
prove our economy is to give working 
Americans a voice. Let them join to-
gether. Let it be fair. A good employer 
will respect that and work with that. 
As Eisenhower said, as I quoted in 
my opening, only a fool would try to 
keep a working American from orga-
nizing into a union. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 188 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 19. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 682) to encourage local educational 
agencies to resume in-person instruction at 
elementary and secondary schools, and for 
other purposes. The first reading of the bill 
shall be dispensed with. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
General debate shall be confined to the bill 
and shall not exceed one hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. After general debate 
the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the five-minute rule. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. When the committee rises and re-
ports the bill back to the House with a rec-
ommendation that the bill do pass, the pre-
vious question shall be considered as ordered 
on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except 
one motion to recommit. If the Committee 
of the Whole rises and reports that it has 
come to no resolution on the bill, then on 
the next legislative day the House shall, im-
mediately after the third daily order of busi-
ness under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into 
the Committee of the Whole for further con-
sideration of the bill. 
SEC. 20. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 682. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question.

COVID RELIEF PACKAGE 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I know that 
no one in this Chamber needs to be re-
minded that we are here to represent 
people. In my community and nation-
wide, many people have been facing un-
precedented financial hardship and per-
sonal struggles for a year now. Despite 
that fact, some people in this town will 
grow louder and louder in saying that 
the American Rescue Plan is too large 
and that after passing tax cuts for the 
super-rich, we can’t afford to come to 
the aid of everyday working people and 
small business owners. 
The truth is that we are in danger of 
doing too little, not too much. As 
Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph 
Stiglitz wrote: ‘‘Congress must pass 
this legislation or risk an anemic and 
devastatingly incomplete recovery.’’ 
After the 2008 financial crash, Wash-
ington bailed out the largest financial 
institutions without passing a large 
enough relief package. The resulting 
recovery was weighted heavily against 
working people. We cannot make that 
same mistake today. 
Passing the American Rescue Plan 
means saving as many as 4 million jobs 
and returning to full employment as 
quickly as possible. It means setting up 
more vaccination sites in our commu-
nities. 
Let’s pass this bill this week and get 
it to the President’s desk for signature. 
f 
HONORING JIM KENNEDY, EAGLE 
SCOUT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and legacy of my dear friend and 
fellow Eagle Scout, Jim Kennedy. I got 
to know him well over the years 
through the Juniata Valley Council 
where he was the Council Scout Execu-
tive. 
Jim embodied the Scouting oath and 
law. He was trustworthy, loyal, helpful, 
friendly, and courteous, to name just a 
few. Jim dedicated himself to service 
and worked diligently to better his 
community, making significant im-
provements to the Seven Mountains 
Scout Camp and earning national rec-
ognition for the Council. 
Jim is survived by his wife of nearly 
40 years, Andrea, and their three sons: 
Matthew, Phillip, and Lincoln. Jim, his 
family, and the Juniata Valley Scout-
ing community are all in our prayers 
as we grieve this loss together. 
Trail signs taught in Scouting, Mr. 
Speaker, show a circle of stones with 
one stone in the center as the sign for 
gone home. Jim Kennedy reached the 
end of his trail in life and returned 
home living Scouting values. 
Rest in peace, Scouter. 
f 
HONORING ARIEL GIBBS 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life and 
memory of Ariel Gibbs whom we lost 5 
years ago. 
Ariel was a beloved neighbor and 
friend to so many members of our East 
Harlem community. She loved working 
with seniors and children and helping 
improve the lives of those around her. 
She was a direct care worker at United 
Cerebral Palsy and often volunteered 
at after-school programs in her com-
munity. 
Ariel will continue to be remembered 
as a strong, wise leader and a dedicated 
friend and daughter, as well as a loving 
mother. Her two energetic and inquisi-
tive sons, now 6 and 7 years old, as well 
as her many friends and family mem-
bers—including her dynamic dad, Eddie 
Gibbs, a leader in East Harlem—will al-
ways hold her in their hearts.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, today 
is International Women’s Day, and I 
rise to celebrate three special women 
who are in my life. 
My mother, Joyce Burchett, was the 
youngest of seven. One of her brothers 
was actually killed by the Nazis short-
ly after D-day in the Second World 
War. 
She flew planes in World War II to 
help with the war effort. That is my 
wonderful mama right there. She was 
doing that when my dad was off fight-
ing the Japanese during the Second 
World War. 
She was the youngest of seven, as I 
stated, and she didn’t even have elec-
tricity until she was a senior in high 
school. 
This is my wife, Kelly, and my 
daughter, Isabel. Kelly was a single 
mom when I met her. Being a mom is 
already a really tough job, and doing it 
alone is even tougher. I am blessed to 
raise Isabel along with Kelly and to be 
a father to her. She has been one of the 
greatest joys in my life. They both 
have been. 
My mother was and Kelly and Isabel 
are strong and determined women. 
They influence and inspire me every 
day, and I am grateful to have them in 
my life. 
f 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
today is International Women’s Day, 
and 
the 
theme 
is 
#ChooseToChallenge—choose to chal-
lenge gender bias and discrimination, 
choose to challenge poor pay, and 
choose to challenge desperate condi-
tions that women are in to be opposed 
to. So we ask that in this day that 
women will realize that they are ready 
and able to challenge what is wrong. 
This is International Women’s Day, 
and I know that the American Rescue 
Plan Act will take women out of the 
quagmire of COVID–19 and economic 
depression. 
As well, we look forward this evening 
to introducing the Violence Against 
Women Act of which I am the lead 
sponsor with over 150 cosponsors, so 
women again can have the protection 
that is needed by law. International 
Women’s Day, yes, we should choose to 
challenge. 
f 
GUN CONTROL 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
week our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle are proposing more gun 
control measures under H.R. 1446 and 
H.R. 8. 
Mr. Speaker, our Constitution pro-
tects all your rights, not selectively by 
the State or issue. One bill makes you 
ask permission via background checks 
with no limits when and how you can 
purchase a firearm. If they don’t com-
plete their work in time, then no gun 
for you. 
This is an indefinite delay of your 
rights. 
Another supposed background check 
bill is designed to make criminals out 
of Americans who are merely trying to 
help out others. Under this bill if a 
neighbor with issues, domestic vio-
lence, or maybe a suicidal situation de-
cides to give you their gun for safe-
keeping, you could end up with a fine 
and a year in prison—$100,000 fine and a 
year in prison for helping them by pos-
sessing that gun for them. 
The same if someone has a problem 
with stalking or domestic violence. 
Maybe you loan a woman a gun. You 
could be also threatened with prosecu-
tion under that guise. 
Neither of these bills work because 
they violate a simple truth: criminals 
don’t follow gun laws. They are crimi-
nals. I have a more reasonable path: 
amendments to guarantee your rights 
under the Second Amendment. 
f 
b 2015 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF NORM 
NITSCHKE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
celebration of the life of a great and 
rare 
American, 
Toledoan 
Norm 
Nitschke. 
Mr. Nitschke passed away in Feb-
ruary at the age of nearly 101. He led a 
full and exceptional life. As an inven-
tor, an engineer, and a renowned pio-
neer of glass and solar manufacturing, 
Norm Nitschke literally changed the 
world. 
He was pivotal in the development of 
tempered glass and creating a market 
for it in the automotive industry. It is 
a technology many of us take for 
granted today, but it has been instru-
mental in saving lives and making 
modern cars safer. 
Then, he went on to found Glasstech 
Solar and Solar Cells, pioneering thin- 
film cadmium telluride technology, 
central to modern solar panels like 
those installed on homes and buildings 
across our country and now the world. 
His pathbreaking work with Dr. Har-
old McMaster created America’s most 
important company in solar energy, 
First Solar in Toledo, Ohio. 
In retirement, he gave back gener-
ously to our community and is a bene-
factor of so many educational institu-
tions: University of Toledo’s engineer-
ing school, Bowling Green State Uni-
versity, Toledo Symphony, and Toledo 
Museum of Art. 
I simply cannot say enough about 
this great American. 
COMMEMORATING 56TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES
of New York). Under the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
any extraneous material on the subject 
of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it 
is my great honor that I will be intro-
ducing members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus for this Special Order, in-
cluding the distinguished chair, who 
has led us to understand our power– 
hour message. I thank the distin-
guished CBC chair, Congresswoman 
JOYCE BEATTY. 
As we begin to do a Special Order on 
Bloody Sunday and a tribute to the 
honorable late John Robert Lewis, who 
was and continues to be the conscience 
of the Congress, it is my privilege to 
yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Mrs. BEATTY), the chairwoman of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great honor to thank our co-chair, 
the gentlewoman from Texas, Con-
gresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, the 
CBC’s parliamentarian, a true con-
stitutional scholar, and someone who 
is fighting for us every day to reau-
thorize the Voting Rights Act, and her 
co-anchor, 
Congressman 
RITCHIE 
TORRES, from New York, but he would 
say the Bronx. Tonight, he is in the 
Speaker’s chair. 
I am very honored to have as our 
guest co-anchor today Congresswoman 
TERRI
SEWELL, another scholar, an-
other lawyer, a person who has led us 
every year across that bridge. She is 
known as a daughter of Selma. 
Tonight is about Our Power, Our 
Message. As we also celebrate Women’s 
History Month and International Wom-
en’s Day, it is fitting that our anchors 
tonight are women. 
I rise this evening for the Congres-
sional Black Caucus’ Special Order 
hour, the first–annual John Lewis Spe-
cial Order hour, on the 56th anniver-
sary of the Bloody Sunday march, and 
to echo Our Power, Our Message. You 
will hear that a lot tonight. 
This is a solemn moment and gives 
us the opportunity to speak directly, 
Mr. Speaker, to the American people 
and reflect on the critical importance 
of voting and voting rights in our coun-
try and on why we must do everything 
in our power to fight attempts to curb 
voting participation and continue to 
promote and advance voting rights. 
Fifty-six years ago, our late col-
league Congressman John Lewis, a true

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1097 
March 8, 2021 
American hero, alongside hundreds of 
others, marched and risked his life to 
protect the voice of the many. His 
courage, and that of so many others, 
brought us the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, a law passed by a bipartisan Con-
gress 
whose 
conscience 
had 
been 
shocked awake. 
These Members of the Congress, Re-
publicans and Democrats, could no 
longer turn their eyes from the bru-
tality that they witnessed on tele-
vision at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 
Selma, Alabama. They knew it was 
time in history to come together for 
justice against all the injustices. 
Without the Voting Rights Act, Mr. 
Speaker, our democracy would be in 
name only. 
We are here tonight at another in-
flection point in this country, where 
we shall decide to follow the forces of 
partisanship, divisiveness, and anger, 
or we will do the right thing. I am so 
pleased to be here today for that right 
thing. That right thing is for us to do 
good and to make good trouble because 
history will judge all of us on our good 
trouble. 
Let me end by saying, tonight, the 
Congressional 
Black 
Caucus 
stands 
here to remind you, as our late great 
brother, friend, and colleague John 
Lewis said: 
I say to the people here today, we must be 
prepared because if you believe in some-
thing, if you believe in something, you have 
to go for it. As individuals, we may not live 
to see the end. 
Tonight, through our message, the 
Congressional Black Caucus will con-
tinue his fight in his name and the 
names of all others who laid the foun-
dation for the work we do. I call on all 
Members to do the right thing because 
it is always the right time to do what 
is right. 
Let’s pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act and H.R. 1 for 
the people. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the distinguished gentle-
woman from Ohio for setting just the 
right tone of why members of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus are on the 
floor today. 
Let me acknowledge the gentleman 
from New York, who is now Speaker 
pro tempore, who is my co-anchor. How 
appropriate for him to be presiding 
over this Special Order dealing with 
the deeply embedded segregationist, 
violent period when we were fighting 
for voting rights. 
Isn’t it interesting that we are now 
in the midst of fighting for the passage 
of H.R. 1, but we are in the midst of a 
battle to ensure the passage of H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act? 
Let me just briefly set the tone, as 
my members continue to do, and to tell 
the story. Maybe many of us may not 
know the significance. I realize that 
there has been some discussion on the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge, which I have 
crossed now for almost 30 years during 
Bloody Sunday, which was, in fact, yes-
terday, March 7. 
It was named after Edmund Pettus. 
Isn’t it interesting that it was named 
more than three decades after his 
death? They wanted to honor a symbol 
of the Confederacy. They wanted to 
honor someone who was soaked in the 
blood and the anguish of slavery. 
This river, the Alabama River, was a 
key route for the slave plantation and 
cotton economy during slavery. That is 
what the Edmund Pettus Bridge was, a 
key route for the cotton economy dur-
ing slavery and Reconstruction. The 
route for the slave plantation and cot-
ton economy crossed this bridge during 
our darkest hour. 
That is who the bridge is named 
after, and this is the bridge that the 
foot soldiers Martin King, Hosea Wil-
liams, 
Andy 
Young, 
John 
Robert 
Lewis, Albert Turner, and many others 
crossed. 
This 56th commemoration is ex-
tremely important today, and it is to 
recognize that the fight and struggle 
still goes. It is to recognize that this 
was not, in fact, a simple process. This 
was not a circumstance where this was 
an easy task. This was a dark moment. 
It was based on the courage of those 
who were willing to lose their life. It 
was based on the courage of these men 
and women and little children as young 
as 8 years old. It was based on the 
death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, in 1964, 
who had gone to one of the meetings 
and was actually shot by a law enforce-
ment officer. 
Tonight, this is a serious moment in 
history. This is a moment in history 
that the Congressional Black Caucus is 
more than able to present to the Amer-
ican people. Listen to us over these 60 
minutes as we tell the story of how im-
perative it is to ensure that the Voter 
Advancement Act named after John 
Robert Lewis is actually passed. 
Let me just give you the words of 
John Robert Lewis as we also pay trib-
ute to him. John Lewis said recently: 
‘‘My philosophy is very simple. When 
you see something that is not right, 
not fair, not just, say something, do 
something. Get in trouble, good trou-
ble.’’ 
Recently, of course, preceding his 
death, this is something we are always 
reminded of. We can see John Lewis, 
who gave all that he could so that we, 
in America, African Americans, Black 
Americans, and all people, could have 
the precious right to vote. 
Tonight, you will hear these stories 
in tribute to him, in tribute to all 
those whose lives were lost in that bat-
tle, that their memory never be forgot-
ten, their fight never be forgotten. The 
Congressional Black Caucus makes 
them a promise that it will not. 
Mr. Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in Selma, 
Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls risked their 
lives for freedom and to secure the right to 
vote for all Americans by their participation in 
marches for voting rights on ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ 
‘‘Turnaround Tuesday,’’ or the final, completed 
march from Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, who were 
led by our beloved colleague, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brave 
and determined men and women, boys and 
girls, persons of all races and creeds, who 
loved their country so much that they were 
willing to risk their lives to make it better, and 
to bring it even closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the 
right to equal treatment under the law, and in 
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote. 
On March 15, 1965, before a joint session 
of the Congress and the eyes of the nation, 
President Lyndon Johnson explained to the 
nation the significance of ‘‘Bloody Sunday’’: 
I speak tonight for the dignity of man and 
the destiny of democracy. . . . 
At times history and fate meet at a single 
time in a single place to shape a turning 
point in man’s unending search for freedom. 
So it was at Lexington and Concord. 
So it was a century ago at Appomattox. 
So it was last week in Selma, Alabama. 
The previous Sunday, March 7, 1965, more 
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including 
our beloved colleague, Congressman John 
Lewis of Georgia whose skull was battered by 
police batons, were brutally attacked by state 
and local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
as they marched from Selma to Montgomery 
in support of the right to vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the 
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and 
effective federal law to protect the right to vote 
of every American. 
No one who witnessed the violence and 
brutality suffered by the foot soldiers for justice 
who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
will ever forget it; the images are deeply 
seared in the American memory and experi-
ence. 
Mr. Speaker, what is so moving, heroic, and 
awe-inspiring is that the foot soldiers of Selma 
faced their heavily armed adversaries fortified 
only by their love for their country and for 
each other and their audacious faith in a right-
eous cause. 
The example set by the foot soldiers of 
Selma showed everyone, here in America and 
around the world, that there is no force on 
earth as powerful as an idea whose time has 
come. 
These great but nameless persons won the 
Battle of Selma and helped redeem the great-
est nation on earth. 
But we should not forget that the victory 
came at great cost and that many good and 
dear persons lost their lives to win for others 
the right to vote. 
Men like Jimmy Lee Jackson, who was shot 
by Alabama state trooper as he tried to protect 
his mother and grandmother from being beat-
en for participating in a peaceful voting rights 
march in Marion, Alabama. 
Women like Viola Liuzzo, a housewife and 
mother of five, who had journeyed to Selma 
from Detroit to join the protests after wit-
nessing on television the events at Edmund 
Pettus Bridge on ‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ and who 
was shot and killed by Klansmen while driving 
back from a trip shuttling fellow voting rights 
marchers to the Montgomery airport. 
Persons of faith, goodwill, and non-violence 
like the Reverend James Reeb of Boston, a 
minister from Boston who heeded the call of 
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to come

to Selma and who succumbed to the head in-
juries he suffered at the hands of his white su-
premacists attackers on March 9, two days 
after ‘‘Bloody Sunday.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, in the face of unspeakable 
hostility, violence, brutality, and hatred, the 
foot soldiers of Selma would not be deterred— 
would not be moved—would not be turned 
around. 
They kept their eyes on the prize and held 
on. 
And help came the very next week when 
President Johnson announced to the Nation 
that he would send to Congress for immediate 
action a law designed to eliminate illegal bar-
riers to the right to vote by striking down ‘‘re-
strictions to voting in all elections—Federal, 
State, and local—which have been used to 
deny Negroes the right to vote.’’ 
On August 6, 1965, that legislation—the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965—was signed into 
law by President Johnson and for the next 48 
years did more to expand our democracy and 
empower racial and language minorities than 
any act of government since the Emancipation 
Proclamation and adoption of the Civil War 
Amendments. 
But our work is not done; the dreams of Dr. 
King and of all those who gave their lives in 
the struggle for justice are not behind us but 
still before us. 
Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the Supreme 
Court’s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Hold-
er, which severely crippled the Voting Rights 
Act, we have seen many states across our na-
tion move to enact legislation designed to limit 
the ability of women, the elderly, and racial 
and language minorities to exercise their right 
to vote. 
To honor the memory of the foot soldiers of 
Selma, we must rededicate ourselves to a 
great task remaining before us—to repair the 
damage done to the Voting Rights Act by 
working to pass legislation like H.R. 4, the 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019, intro-
duced in the 116th Congress, which I was 
proud to be one of the original co-sponsors. 
As I have stated many times, the 1965 Vot-
ing Rights Act is no ordinary piece of legisla-
tion. 
For millions of Americans, and for many in 
Congress, it is sacred treasure, earned by the 
sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary 
Americans who showed the world it was pos-
sible to accomplish extraordinary things. 
As we remember and honor the foot sol-
diers of Selma, let us resolve also to restore 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 so that the Vot-
ing Rights Act remains a lasting monument to 
their heroism and devotion to the country they 
loved. 
Our leader on this, who has taken up 
the mantle, who has worked with John 
Robert Lewis, is, how should I say, a 
sister of the South, of Alabama, a 
scholar and a lawyer, but with a pas-
sion and a heart for voting rights, for 
justice. And, yes, as we both have said, 
our 
beloved 
brother, 
John 
Robert 
Lewis, has a special place in our 
hearts. I know that he has a special 
place in mine, and he has a special 
place in the heart of the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Alabama, TERRI SE-
WELL. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL). 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, JOYCE BEATTY. 
I would like to thank the original an-
chors of tonight’s and every CBC Spe-
cial Order hour, the distinguished gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) and the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. TORRES). I thank 
them for relinquishing to me, just for 
tonight’s Special Order hour, the op-
portunity to be a guest anchor. 
Yesterday, we commemorated the 
56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, an 
event in American history where ordi-
nary Americans in my hometown of 
Selma, Alabama, brought about ex-
traordinary social change as they 
peacefully demonstrated for the equal 
right to vote. 
Each year, those foot soldiers would 
return to the Edmund Pettus Bridge to 
seek renewal, rededication, recommit-
ment to the cause for which they 
fought, the cause of justice and equal-
ity. These heroes, known and unknown, 
risked their very lives for the oppor-
tunity of all Americans to vote. 
b 2030 
So many people got to read about it 
in their history books. I got to live it, 
being a native of Selma, Alabama, a 
daughter of Selma, but also a lifetime 
member of the historic Brown Chapel 
AME Church, where those marchers 
gathered peacefully before they walked 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
Yesterday was a solemn day. I did so 
walking across that bridge without 
John Lewis. Congressman Lewis is 
known to so many as an icon. But when 
you grow up in Selma, Alabama, he is 
more than just that. He was our hero. 
Only in America could a little, Black 
girl grow up and watch her hero, year 
after year after year, always during 
Bloody Sunday, come back to Selma to 
remind the world that his cause, their 
cause, was not over yet. 
We know that progress is elusive. We 
know that every generation must fight 
and fight again for the progress that 
was made by the previous generation, 
and they must advance it as well. 
When I look at John Lewis on the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge, I can’t help but be 
reminded of the very young John Lewis 
who, 56 years ago, carried a backpack. 
Now, you know, madam co-anchor, 
that in that backpack, he had an apple, 
he had a toothbrush, and he had a 
Bible. He said that he wanted to be pre-
pared to spend the night in jail. 
He and Hosea Williams and 600 
marchers peacefully marched for the 
right to vote. But they were met on 
that bridge by a sea of Alabama State 
Troopers who told them that they had 
5 minutes to disperse—5 minutes to dis-
perse. They wanted to gather and pray. 
They almost started to kneel, but they 
didn’t have time to do that, because 
the very people whose job it was to pro-
tect and serve the people were the ones 
who beat them with billy clubs while 
riding horseback and gassed them. 
When I think about John Lewis, it is 
this iconic picture of John being beat-
en at the foot of the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. 
He wasn’t alone. So many people that 
people don’t know about, like Amelia 
Boynton Robinson, who I had the great 
fortune, during the 215th State of the 
Union, on the 100th anniversary, to be 
my special guest. Ms. Boynton, not 
quite as known as John Lewis, but nev-
ertheless a foot soldier for justice, 
beaten and battered on a bridge. As 
John would say, he shed and they shed 
a little blood on a bridge for America 
to live up to its promise, its promise of 
equality and justice for all. 
Old battles have become new again, 
and John knew that that progress was 
elusive. He started a pilgrimage, con-
gressional bipartisan pilgrimage. He 
wanted his colleagues in Congress to 
experience walking in his footsteps 
through 
Birmingham, 
Montgomery, 
and Selma. Year after year we would 
march; year after year we would 
march. 
Faith in politics. I know so many 
people who will be speaking tonight 
will be pictured right here on this 
amazing photo. People like STENY 
HOYER, BARBARA LEE, SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE, so many would come year after 
year with John. 
Why was it important for us to come? 
It was important, because as John said, 
we must never forget. 
When I got the news that John 
passed—you know, we knew that pan-
creatic cancer, stage 4, was a kiss of 
death, but we also knew if anyone 
could fight it, it would be John. I can 
remember sitting in my bedroom, as I 
heard about John’s death, having spo-
ken to him only 2 weeks prior, my 
heart was heavy. But at the same time, 
my spirit soared, because I knew that 
we had an opportunity to walk among 
an angel right here on Earth, that he 
gave us the roadmap, he told us that 
we must never give up, that we must 
never give in, that we have to keep the 
faith. 
He believed, more than anything, 
that America’s best days were ahead of 
it. It is now incumbent upon us to pick 
up that baton and to carry it to the 
next leg. 
Who would have ever thought when I 
was a child sitting in Brown Chapel, 
singing in the choir, singing in the 
choir on those commemorative Bloody 
Sundays, with Coretta Scott King 
there, Juanita Abernathy there, C. T. 
Vivian there, Joseph Lowery there, and 
John Lewis there—but one, by one, by 
one, they are now gone. And we, who 
are their beneficiaries, must pick up 
their cause. Their cause must become 
our cause, too. 
I never would have thought that 56 
years would pass, and I, as Alabama’s 
first 
Black 
Congresswoman, 
would 
have to seek congressional action in 
order to enforce the very bill that John 
Lewis and so many unknown Ameri-
cans bludgeoned on a bridge in Selma— 
that we, Congress Members, 
must 
stand up to the task. 
The Shelby v. Holder decision struck 
down section 4. But H.R. 4, the John

Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act, would fully restore the pro-
tections of the Voting Rights Act. 
What a befitting tribute to John Rob-
ert Lewis, the Boy from Troy, that we 
not only walk the walk and talk the 
talk, but that we pick up that mantle 
and we pass H.R. 4. 
Now, I know we are going to get it 
through the House. I know that. I know 
that my colleagues are committed. I 
also know that the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration wants to sign a bill that 
will put section 4 back into the Voting 
Rights Act. 
What I am not sure is if we can get 
enough of our Republican colleagues— 
so many of whom came on those pil-
grimages with John Lewis, walked side 
by side in a bipartisan effort to show 
the world that what happened on those 
sacred places in my district, Bir-
mingham—to visit the 16th Street Bap-
tist Church where the four little girls 
were killed, to see in Montgomery the 
very spot where Rosa Parks could not 
sit on a bus, to walk across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge. It was not just a 
photo op, I pray, but rather a call to 
action that now they, too, can pay it 
forward. 
When we file H.R. 4, it will be after 
we have prepared, had an evidentiary 
hearing and all the evidence. We will 
be informed. That formula will be in-
formed by the most egregious of actors, 
because we know it has to be narrowly 
tailored. We know that we can’t just 
submit the same formula, and we 
won’t. Because here is what is impor-
tant: What is important is Federal 
oversight, as we have seen State after 
State recently impose more egregious, 
restrictive photo I.D. laws and restric-
tive barriers to voting. 
I am honored today to be a part of 
this tribute to John Lewis. I know so 
many want to speak. I am just going to 
say in closing, John is always in our 
midst, because John’s call to action 
was very familiar to all of us. He told 
us that ours was not a struggle of one 
day, not even one lifetime. He told us 
that ours was a struggle for a cause 
greater than us and that that beloved 
community was possible if people of 
goodwill, Black and White, Republican 
and Democrat, Christian and all the re-
ligions, if we would just do the right 
thing, that when we see such injustice, 
we have to stand up and fight it out. 
Can’t you hear him? I can. Never give 
up. Never give in. Get into some good 
trouble, necessary trouble, and we look 
forward to doing that for John Robert 
Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, I’m Congresswoman TERRI SE-
WELL and I proudly represent Alabama’s Sev-
enth District—the Civil Rights District—which 
includes the historic cities of Birmingham, 
Montgomery and my hometown of Selma. 
It’s an honor for me to guest anchor with 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE tonight. I am honored to 
participate in the First Annual John Lewis 
Good Trouble Special Order Hour on the 
heels of the 56th Anniversary of the Bloody 
Sunday March. 
In 2020 we mourned the loss of a giant: the 
late, great Congressman John Lewis; my dear 
friend and mentor. 
Though I am reminded daily of the sacrifices 
made by John and the known and unknown 
foot soldiers on that bridge 56 years ago, this 
commemoration feels unmistakably different. 
Each year, John would lead a congressional 
delegation onto the bridge in my hometown 
where he was bludgeoned for the sacred right 
to vote. Every time, you felt like you were 
there with him, overwhelmed with emotion and 
grounded by courage as he stood before the 
brigade of police officers telling him and the 
rest to turn back. 
In March 2020, John, battling cancer, sur-
prised everyone, arriving at the 55th anniver-
sary of the march to speak at the apex of the 
bridge. 
That was John—relentless in the fight for 
what he believed in and willing to risk his life 
for the betterment of humanity. 
The horrific events of Bloody Sunday 
brought the reality of the fight for voting rights 
to living rooms across our country. It was 
there, in my hometown of Selma, where ordi-
nary Americans dared to follow through on 
their extraordinary commitment to justice and 
equality for all, that led to the signing of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
For me, growing up in Selma, under the 
shadow of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the his-
tory of the voting rights movement was not 
something I had to learn in school. 
The foot soldiers of the movement were not 
pictures or names in a history book, they were 
a vital and vibrant part of the community in 
Selma—they were my teachers, my church 
members, my piano teacher, our firefighters 
and even my babysitter. 
Their valiant, collective efforts put Selma on 
the map in a way that no one could have 
imagined, so much so that we still celebrate 
and commemorate those efforts today. 
The 
movement 
continues, 
because 
it 
must—because the fight for equity is as impor-
tant now as it was in 1965. Selma is still now. 
Old battles have become new again. Since 
the Supreme Court in Shelby v. Holder gutted 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in 2013, state 
legislatures all across the Nation have passed 
restrictive voter laws making it harder for cer-
tain people to vote. 
As a result of November’s historic electoral 
victories, many Republican state legislators, 
Members of Congress, and far-right interest 
groups are working overtime to keep voters 
from the ballot box by introducing hundreds of 
new voting restrictions across the country. 
Without federal protections against discrimi-
nation, States across the country have en-
acted new voter suppression tactics that sub-
ject voters to: longer lines; inaccessible polling 
places; strict voter ID requirements; broken 
voting machines; and more. 
Twenty-eight states have enacted and im-
plemented voter ID laws since 2010 and, in 
just two months, 250 restrictions have been in-
troduced in 43 states. 
Indeed, voter suppression is still alive and 
well. 
Never did I think the cause for which John 
Lewis marched for 56 years ago—the VOT-
ING RIGHTS ACT would require congres-
sional action to restore its full protection. 
It reminds us that progress is elusive and 
every generation must fight and fight again. 
The legacy of my district requires that I pick 
up this baton of voter equality and continue 
the next leg—their cause is my cause too. 
I look forward to introducing H.R. 4, The 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act, because the 
reality is—we have not yet achieved the Amer-
ica that John dreamed of. 
John knew that our Country’s best days lie 
ahead of us, but we must seize the opportuni-
ties to enact change every day. 
He understood that democracy is not the 
whim or edict of one person; it is a constant, 
collective act of reinvention. We are a Nation 
founded on a call to action—to strive daily for 
a more perfect union. 
Every one of us has a role to play. As lead-
ers we must lead and as citizens we must 
vote. 
May we all be renewed by the 56th Bloody 
Sunday anniversary and recommit ourselves 
to the ideals of equality and justice for which 
the foot soldiers marched. Let our words and 
actions stir the soul of our Nation. 
John gave us his final call to action: John 
said, ‘‘Never give up, never give in, keep the 
faith, keep your eyes on the prize.’’ 
Let’s get into good trouble. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her power-
ful message on good trouble and doing 
the right thing. I can hear John Lewis 
right now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON), the 
distinguished chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
56 years ago, our beloved colleague, the 
late Congressman John Lewis, and 
hundreds of other heroes marched 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
We now know this infamous day in 
American history as Bloody Sunday. 
These warriors of justice were bru-
tally harassed, beaten, and murdered 
by Alabama State Troopers and county 
citizens, all fellow Americans. 
But it was because of their courage 
on that day, because of their unwaver-
ing commitment to finishing that 
march that inspired President Lyndon 
Johnson to sign into law the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
And it was because of their continued 
advocacy that the Voting Rights Act 
was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982, 
1992, and again in 2006. 
When I was chair of the CBC in the 
107th Congress, we worked diligently in 
a bicameral fashion to protect voting 
rights in this country. 
I teamed up with former Senators 
Tom Daschle, Chris Dodd, and our cur-
rent Senator DICK DURBIN, to pass the 
Help America Vote Act of 2002. 
Specifically, this bill was signed into 
law by President Bush on October 29, 
2002. 
Help America Vote provided funds to 
our States to improve voting equip-
ment and train workers at polling 
places. 
But even with all of the policy work 
to level the playing field, why are we 
still advocating for our right to vote in 
2021? 
The answer is that there has been a 
widening gap of epic proportions be-
tween the ideals of the Voting Rights 
Act and the harsh reality that many

Black and Brown Americans face; that 
is, blatant and recognizable acts of 
voter suppression. 
Some of the ways it manifests itself 
is through partisan gerrymandering, 
obstructive voter I.D. laws, felony dis-
enfranchisement, just to name a few. 
b 2045 
But, today, we have doors of oppor-
tunity open, and we still must refer 
back to Bloody Sunday and to John 
Lewis’s leadership. Take this Special 
Order hour, hosted by the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, and in the mem-
ory of John, as a prime example of our 
progress. 
Mr. Speaker, it is in that spirit that 
I call upon Congress to pass the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
We must eliminate that type of dis-
crimination, and we must protect and 
preserve widespread voting access for 
all Americans. 
I thank Congresswoman BEATTY and 
Congresswoman SEWELL
for hosting 
this Special Order tonight on behalf of 
the Congressional Black Caucus. It is 
time. 
My last question is: How long? 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for that ques-
tion of how long. Now it is my privilege 
to yield to a distinguished leader of the 
House, the co-chair of the Steering and 
Policy Committee, a senior member on 
Appropriations, the Honorable BAR-
BARA LEE. 
Ms. LEE of California. Thank you, 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON
LEE, 
for 
yielding, for your tremendous leader-
ship on so many issues, and for once 
again bringing us together tonight. 
You and our Speaker pro tempore who 
is managing the floor tonight, Con-
gressman RITCHIE TORRES, I thank you 
both so much for really continuing to 
beat the drum throughout the country 
about so many issues that are so im-
portant to not only the African-Amer-
ican community, but to our entire 
country. 
Also, to our Chairwoman, Congress-
woman JOYCE BEATTY, I just want to 
salute you for your leadership and for 
really ensuring that the Congressional 
Black Caucus stays the conscience of 
the Congress in so many ways on so 
many issues, being such an inclusive 
caucus under your leadership, which is, 
I guess, the largest one ever now on our 
50th anniversary. So thank you so 
much. 
And to Congresswoman TERRI
SE-
WELL, daughter of Selma, I know your 
mother is very proud of you, and I 
know that John Lewis is shining his 
light upon you and Selma and this 56th 
anniversary of Bloody Sunday. 
Congresswoman SEWELL, I just have 
to say that I have been with her many 
times in Selma, in Alabama. She fights 
so hard for her constituents, but also 
to make sure that Selma gets the rec-
ognition, the credit, and also the re-
sources that it so deserves as being 
that historical place where, had it not 
been for Bloody Sunday and Selma, we 
would not be here tonight as a strong 
Congressional Black Caucus leading 
the way on so many issues. 
A year later, after John Lewis’s pass-
ing, of course, we celebrate his life and 
his legacy, but also we honor him for 
really passing the baton to our young 
people, who he knew would take that 
baton and run this next lap of the race. 
I had the privilege to attend the 
Faith & Politics pilgrimages for many, 
many years, at least 17 or 18 years. I 
took children, young people from my 
Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Cen-
ter on these pilgrimages. We crossed 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge many times 
each year. John Lewis was so com-
mitted. Even with the 500, 600 people 
there, he took time to talk to young 
people, to explain to them not only the 
historical context upon which we were 
marching across that bridge, but he 
took time to encourage them and to 
empower them to take that baton and 
run this lap of the race for justice. 
I just have to tell you now with what 
is going on in the country now with 
voter suppression efforts throughout, 
we cannot go back to the days of Jim 
Crow. I am thinking now, 56 years later 
after Bloody Sunday, the moment that 
we are in, because we must run this lap 
of the race and we must run it much 
faster now. 
Bloody Sunday was just that. It was 
bloody. It was bloody. Those who were 
beaten and bloodied 56 years ago, they 
deserve our gratitude and our honor by 
passing the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act, H.R. 4. Because of those heroes 
and sheroes, we all stand here as Mem-
bers of Congress. 
Because of John Lewis, he believed in 
the promise of liberty and justice for 
all and the beloved community, which 
we all are fighting for and insisting 
that we come together to pass H.R. 4. 
This is a moment—a defining mo-
ment, I believe, for our democracy be-
cause we shouldn’t have to stand here 
56 years later, after so many people 
were bloodied, and say we once again 
have to fight this battle again. 
I hope tonight that those who are lis-
tening will really understand this de-
fining moment we are in and help us 
pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. We owe it to John 
Lewis 56 years later. We owe it to those 
foot soldiers, those heroes and sheroes 
who marched across that bridge. We 
owe it to those who are still helping us. 
We owe it to those seniors, those elders 
in Selma and in Alabama, who are still 
out there fighting to make sure that 
liberty and justice for all prevails. 
Tonight, I just want to thank the 
Congressional Black Caucus for hon-
oring Congressman John Lewis, for 
lifting up Selma and Bloody Sunday. I 
missed being there this weekend. This 
is quite a moment for me because I 
miss seeing John sitting right over 
there, getting into some good trouble, 
talking to all of us, saying, ‘‘Okay, 
now, this is what we have got to do to-
morrow. This is what we have got to do 
today. Are you coming down?’’ You 
know, talking about votes on the floor. 
I mean, John was such a mentor to 
all of us and he encouraged us. Tonight 
is just very powerful for all of us to be 
able to recognize him, thank him, and 
say we must pass H.R. 4 in his honor. 
This is our power and this is our mes-
sage. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her re-
marks. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time is re-
maining, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 25 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure now to yield to the dis-
tinguished gentlewoman from Detroit, 
the co-chair of the Women’s Caucus, 
and an officer with the Congressional 
Black Caucus. That is the Honorable 
BRENDA LAWRENCE. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of a legend and the con-
science of this Congress, a civil rights 
hero and a dear friend, the late Rep-
resentative John Lewis. 
I stand here today also to give honor 
to the facilitator for this hour, and 
that is SHEILA JACKSON LEE; and also 
to honor the current chair of the Black 
Caucus because we in the Black Caucus 
remind ourselves that we are the con-
science of Congress. We could never 
forget that with John Lewis and his 
guidance because the pictures that you 
saw displayed by TERRI SEWELL are the 
things that when we looked at John 
Lewis, we have flashbacks of the sac-
rifices he made so that we could enjoy 
the freedoms that we have. 
Yesterday marked the 56th anniver-
sary of Bloody Sunday, the first of 
which 
was 
commemorated 
without 
John standing there welcoming all of 
us. Although he is not with us, his life 
serves as a blueprint of how we can 
make this country a better place. 
Every single day John was committed 
to justice, equality, and a little bit of 
good trouble. We must carry on this 
legacy by working to restore the Vot-
ing Rights Act. 
I remember one time being chal-
lenged by John. He said, ‘‘Why do you 
think they worked so hard? Why do 
you think they worked so hard to take 
away your right to vote?’’ He said that 
we have to stand up, and we can’t allow 
that freedom and the right in our de-
mocracy to vote. 
We passed the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act once before. 
And I stand with my colleague, TERRI 
SEWELL. We will pass it again. In honor 
of John’s memory and the hundreds of 
civil rights activists who were beaten 
on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the 
countless others who have fought for 
voting rights, we must pass this bill 
again. 
As John famously said, ‘‘Never, ever 
be afraid to make some noise and get 
into good trouble.’’ 
He reminded us that that good trou-
ble was necessary trouble for the rights 
and freedoms of Americans—all Ameri-
cans. 
While we say we miss John, he has 
not left because of the memories, the

blood he shed, the example he led, and 
his constant voice in our ears to never, 
ever give up. I stand here today to 
honor him. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her re-
marks. She reminded us that his sac-
rifice was not a simple one. He shed 
blood. John Robert Lewis shed blood 
because of his beliefs and his commit-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege 
to be able to yield to the distinguished 
gentlewoman, the chair and founder of 
the Historically Black College Caucus, 
a longtime academician and professor 
at a historically Black college, and 
that is the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina, ALMA ADAMS. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Texas and our 
co-anchors. I want to thank our Chair-
woman, Congresswoman BEATTY; Con-
gresswoman SEWELL, as well; and to all 
who have participated tonight. Thank 
you, Brother TORRES, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of my 
colleague and friend, my hero, a hero 
to all of us, John Lewis, and to mark 
the anniversary of the Bloody Sunday 
march. 
When our country was founded al-
most 250 years ago, African Americans 
were denied full access and participa-
tion in society, and we have been fight-
ing to rectify these wrongs ever since. 
Among the most important influential 
agents of this mission was John Lewis, 
the conscience of this Congress; a mas-
termind of good, good, good trouble; a 
courageous and compassionate man 
who gave everything, including his 
blood and his body, to the civil rights 
movement. 
From Selma to the U.S. House, John 
wasn’t afraid to put everything on the 
line for what he believed in. Fifty-six 
years ago, he marched so that people 
who look like me could be full partici-
pants in our society. Fifty-six years 
later, we are still fighting to be seen, 
to be heard, to be counted in our de-
mocracy, a democracy that we helped 
to build. 
For centuries, this country has made 
promises to marginalized communities 
that have gone mostly unmet, promises 
of freedom, equality, and access to op-
portunity. 
In my home State of North Carolina, 
discriminatory 
voter 
regulations 
plague our past and even our present. 
Most recently, we have experienced a 
decade of voter suppression laws that 
target minority voters with surgical 
precision and illegally gerrymandered 
maps that have thrown our election 
into chaos. Voting in North Carolina 
has never been treated as it should be, 
as a fundamental right for all citizens. 
The For the People Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
will address this by cleaning up corrup-
tion in Washington and returning us to 
a government of, by, and for the peo-
ple. 
H.R. 1 will protect and expand voting 
rights, restore integrity to govern-
ment, and put the priorities of the 
American people ahead of special inter-
ests. The John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act provides the tools to 
address discriminatory election prac-
tices and will protect all Americans’ 
right to vote. 
These important bills are critical 
first steps toward healing our democ-
racy. I won’t allow voter suppression to 
continue to be the norm in North Caro-
lina or in our Nation. That is why we 
must honor our friend John’s legacy by 
passing the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act and sending both of 
these bills to the President’s desk. 
Our power, our message. 
b 2100 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman ADAMS for say-
ing what our power is all about. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD), the first 
vice chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus and a leader in the fight for 
labor rights that brought him to the 
United States Congress. 
Congressman HORSFORD is the distin-
guished gentleman from Nevada, and I 
hope I have gotten that right because I 
have been there many times, and I 
know that I have to get it right. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the designees 
for this Special Order hour, Congress-
woman SEWELL
and, of course, our 
chair JOYCE
BEATTY
and all of the 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Today I rise to honor my friend, my 
mentor, my colleague, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis and all of those 
who marched for justice across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge 56 years ago. 
As they marched, each of those he-
roes carried an unshakeable belief that 
America would answer their call for ra-
cial equality. But at the end of that 
bridge they were met with a violent 
mob that was determined to preserve 
the status quo of brutality against 
Black 
Americans. 
Bloody 
Sunday 
shocked the world, and it shamed our 
government into action. 
Just 
days 
after 
Bloody 
Sunday, 
President Johnson sent a voting rights 
bill to Congress. By August of 1965, the 
Voting Rights Act had passed the 
House and Senate with bipartisan ma-
jorities. 
For decades, the Voting Rights Act 
protected the right to vote and was re-
authorized. But 8 years ago, a conserv-
ative majority on the Supreme Court 
turned 
their 
back 
on 
decades 
of 
progress and struck down critical sec-
tions of the law. 
After the Supreme Court’s decision, 
State governments began to imme-
diately purge voter rolls and institute 
burdensome requirements on voting to 
block communities of color from the 
ballot box. 
In the last election, many States re-
fused to expand vote-by-mail options 
that would have kept voters safe. In-
stead of using billy clubs and dogs, 
they used the pandemic’s deadly toll on 
communities of color to try and sup-
press the vote. 
In the face of this cruelty, we fought 
back with record setting voter turnout. 
But voter suppression continues to be a 
stain on our democracy. 
So we must restore every inch of the 
Voting Rights Act, and we must do it 
now. 
Two years ago, House Democrats in-
troduced and passed H.R. 4, the Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. This bill, 
which is now named for Congressman 
John Lewis, would restore the protec-
tions that were eliminated in Shelby v. 
Holder and end voter suppression. 
Last Congress, this bill passed with 
just one Republican vote. This session, 
I am calling on all of my colleagues to 
follow the example that our prede-
cessors set back in 1965 and to come to-
gether for the American people. Be-
cause the right to vote is fundamental. 
I wanted to share in closing this pic-
ture that I treasure in my office. As a 
freshman Member, I had the honor to 
stand with Congressman John Lewis 
and STENY HOYER, the minority leader 
at the time, when we introduced the 
Voting Rights Act. 
And the picture captured me in the 
middle as we were talking about the 
Voting Rights Act, and its importance, 
and it is something that I look at for 
inspiration. And so to Congressman 
John Lewis I say to you my friend, We 
will carry on your baton. We will carry 
on your legacy. And we will carry on 
the fundamental right to protect the 
vote for all Americans. That is our 
message. That is our power. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished gentleman. We 
will carry on the fight. Thank you for 
challenging us tonight. I think that ev-
eryone knows that we will not rest 
until the Voter Rights Act, H.R. 4, the 
John Robert Lewis bill is passed. 
Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege 
to yield to the distinguished gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS), who 
stood at this podium some years ago as 
the leader of the Special Order. And I 
am delighted to seek to grow as tall as 
he is in this job, because he is now a 
leading member of the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from the great State of 
Texas for that introduction and along 
with my colleague from the great State 
of Alabama. 
When I had my first visit ever in my 
life to Alabama it was because of TERRI 
SEWELL who got me down there, and to 
the chairwoman of our fantastic cau-
cus, Congresswoman BEATTY. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my col-
leagues from the Congressional Black 
Caucus in honoring the memory of 
Congressman John Lewis and renewing 
his call for good trouble. 
I was 10 years old when I first saw 
Congressman Lewis on television walk-
ing across the Pettus Bridge. And I had

March 8, 2021 
to be here to stand at this anniversary 
of the Bloody Sunday march in Selma 
when Congressman Lewis and so many 
others risked their lives for the right 
to vote. 
This year we have seen more than 250 
State-level bills that will restrict vot-
ing. Members of the Pennsylvania leg-
islature have introduced at least 14 re-
strictive voting measures, 14 bills in-
cluding some that would require a 
State-approved excuse to vote absen-
tee. That would be a rollback of the 
vote-by-mail law. 
It is important to stand, Mr. Speak-
er, to stand tall and for us to learn 
from the great John Lewis that if you 
see something, do something. There is 
no way that I could not add my voice 
to this effort. I must stand because I 
see something, and I plan to do some-
thing. 
It is important to understand that we 
need to keep working on the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
by getting into good trouble. We need 
to all be prepared, Mr. Speaker, to con-
tinue this fight. 
Although 
Congressman 
Lewis 
is 
physically not with us, his spirit is 
with us, and we all must recognize that 
only through the collective effort in 
the spirit that he has imparted upon us 
that we must continue this effort. 
So I wanted to make sure that my 
voice is added to the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act, and I 
want to do everything that I can to en-
sure that it takes place because it is 
for these types of efforts that we need 
a constant reminder. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to Congresswoman 
SEWELL, yes, we must continue our 
journey to Alabama, to Selma. We 
must continue these discussions and 
raise our voice. We must continue to 
show people that until this happens, we 
are not going to stop. It is important 
to all of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
BEATTY
for showing the leadership, 
along with Congresswoman JACKSON 
LEE, for us showing this collective ef-
fort, for us working together to pass 
this act today. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania, who has provided our road map 
that we are going to use to take this 
long journey, and we are not going to 
stop until we finish the job. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
This distinguished Congresswoman has 
a voice of passion for an issue that 
John Lewis had a voice of passion for, 
and I believe that it clearly was before 
she came, if I am not mistaken, that 
John Lewis led a floor boycott so that 
gun legislation could be passed. 
You see, he is and was the conscience 
of the Congress. I think he must have 
known that Congresswoman MCBATH 
was coming to Congress. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague Representative SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the 
56th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday 
march, but for the first time we ob-
served the solemn anniversary feeling 
the tremendous absence of our col-
league, our friend, our brother, John 
Lewis. 
Though John is no longer with us, his 
spirit and his soul still fill this Cham-
ber. And even amidst the noise and the 
bitter rancor, one can still hear his 
words ringing so loudly that they can-
not be ignored. ‘‘Get in good trouble, 
necessary trouble, and help redeem the 
soul of America.’’ 
John Lewis was widely known as the 
conscience of Congress, and I can’t 
think of a more fitting description of 
our friend, a man who nearly lost his 
life on that bridge in Selma in the 
struggle for voting rights. 
John went on to represent his com-
munity in Congress for 33 years. 
Whether 
marching 
for 
freedom 
in 
Selma or sitting on the House floor in 
support of safer gun laws, while I was 
on the outside leading a rally for the 
very same thing, John reminded each 
of us of the importance of getting into 
good, necessary trouble. It was one of 
the greatest honors of my life to be his 
colleague and fellow Member of Geor-
gia’s congressional delegation. 
As Americans we owe a great debt of 
gratitude to those who were on that 
bridge in Selma, for sacrificing their 
blood in pursuit of a more perfect 
Union. We honor the legacies those 
men and women left behind by picking 
up the mantle of equality and justice 
for all and supporting the fight for 
what is right and for what is just. 
Because even in this moment we are 
painfully reminded that the work re-
mains unfinished. For many years be-
fore we mourned the death of John 
Lewis, we grieved the loss of the Fed-
eral protections which the Voting 
Rights Act once afforded all Ameri-
cans, rights for which John Lewis near-
ly gave his life long before he ever had 
the chance to serve his community in 
Congress. And 56 years later the strug-
gle to protect voting rights continues 
back home in my State of Georgia and 
in State legislatures all across this 
country. 
As John would often say, we have a 
moral obligation, a mission, and a 
mandate to do what we can to make 
our country and our world a better 
place and to help usher in a loving 
community where no one is left out or 
left behind. 
Those words ring louder and louder 
for every day that goes by without the 
sacred protections of the Voting Rights 
Act. And so today, we must again step 
forward with a renewed unity of pur-
pose to do what is necessary to restore 
and protect the right to vote for all 
Americans and to fulfill the vision laid 
forth by those heroes who marched be-
fore us. Heroes like our John Lewis. 
And it is more important than ever 
now to pass H.R. 4, the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for reminding 
us of how broad Congressman Lewis’ 
civil rights fight was. And he was the 
conscience to change all that was bad 
to make it good. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 31⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it 
is my privilege now to yield to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from New York 
(Mr. JONES), who has come with a sto-
ried history on fighting for those who 
cannot fight for themselves. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, 56 years 
ago, 600 peaceful protesters, led by the 
late John Lewis, prepared to cross the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right to 
vote. On the other side stood Sheriff 
Jim Clark and his armed patrolmen 
ready to stop them. 
The protesters marched on. Clark 
and his troopers put on their gas 
masks, blasted the marchers with tear-
gas, and then brutally beat them with 
billy clubs and cattle prods. 
Some of Clark’s men mounted their 
horses and charged into the crowd 
trampling protesters while unleashing 
a rebel yell. They beat John Lewis so 
hard, they broke his skull. He and doz-
ens of his fellow marchers were hos-
pitalized. 
b 2115 
Mr. Speaker, 5 months after Bloody 
Sunday, Congress enacted the Voting 
Rights Act. As we remember Bloody 
Sunday, let us also recognize the Jim 
Clarks who blocked the bridge to de-
mocracy today. 
Five decades after Bloody Sunday, 
the Supreme Court struck down the 
heart of the Voting Rights Act in a de-
cision in 2013 called Shelby. As we com-
memorate our first Bloody Sunday 
without John Lewis, Republicans in 
Georgia have passed a new law crack-
ing down on the right to vote. 
Today, as we answer John’s call to 
cross the bridge to democracy once 
again, let us hope that no Supreme 
Court Justices stand in our way on the 
other side. If they do, may we, like our 
ancestors, march on. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman very much. Con-
cise but powerful. We know what our 
guidepost is. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t think that the 
history of the United States has had a 
more civil rights activist as Speaker, 
one who is a fighter for justice. We are 
delighted to have her joining us this 
evening. Her voice has been alongside 
John Robert Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
our 
distinguished 
Speaker 
of 
the 
House, joining us on the commemora-
tion of Bloody Sunday. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I will take a few sec-
onds to say thank you to the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, to Congress-
woman JACKSON LEE; Congresswoman 
TERRI SEWELL; the chair of the Con-
gressional 
Black 
Caucus, 
JOYCE 
BEATTY; and so many members.

H1103 
March 8, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I have been watching 
the 
presentation. 
It 
is 
so 
heart-
warming, but I did not want to miss 
the chance to say thank you to all of 
you for this commemoration of this 
56th anniversary. For so many of us 
who have gone there many times over, 
it is a hole in our heart not to be able 
to be there for our precious John 
Lewis, who gave us so much. 
In the next couple of days, we are 
going to be talking about justice, jobs, 
healthcare, and all the things that he 
stood for. And we are going to pass 
H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 and have the John 
Lewis language become law. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to Congressman John Lewis on the 
56th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday March. 
Congressman Lewis spent more than 30 
years in Congress, marched with Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., and fought for racial equality 
across the country during his storied and his-
toric life. The civil rights icon died on July 17, 
2020, after a tragic fight with cancer. 
It was a devastating loss for me and our en-
tire country. Congressman Lewis was such a 
great fighter for the right thing in our nation. 
With his passing, I lost one of my fathers on 
the floor of the House. He was a colleague of 
my father, Congressman Donald M. Payne, 
Sr. and one of the men who inspired me to 
run for office. I was in awe of how he could 
convey such power and strength with a gentle 
demeanor. His passion and love for his coun-
try and people brought out a ferociousness in 
such a mild-mannered man. He didn’t just 
speak for civil rights, he stood up against 
abuse and suffered for it to make this country 
better for all Americans. 
I learned so much from him and his leader-
ship was evident in hundreds of actions in and 
out of the U.S. House of Representatives. One 
of my greatest honors happened when we 
held a ‘sit-in’ on the floor of the House in 2016 
to try and get a vote on gun control legislation 
after 49 people died during a shooting at a 
nightclub in Orlando, FL. It was his drive and 
dedication that inspired me and so many of 
my colleagues to join him that day. There 
were so many situations like that I could men-
tion. Congressman Lewis always said it was 
important to ‘get into good trouble’ and those 
words have inspired me to this day. He was 
a hero, a mentor, a leader, and a great, great 
friend.

BIDEN’S EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER) is recognized until 
10 p.m. as the designee of the minority

Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS), my colleague. 
COMMEMORATING 56TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY 
SUNDAY 
Ms. 
WILLIAMS 
of 
Georgia. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I am here tonight as a daugh-
ter of Alabama, as the Congresswoman 
representing Georgia’s Fifth Congres-
sional District in the seat that was 
held by Congressman John Lewis for 
over 30 years. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Congressman 
John 
Lewis already laid the blueprint for us. 
We are here as the Congressional Black 
Caucus to honor him 56 years after 
Bloody Sunday. We have an obligation 
to get in good trouble and continue 
Congressman Lewis’ legacy. 
As Congressman Lewis told us, when 
we see something that is not right, 
when we see something that is not fair, 
when we see something that is not just, 
we have an obligation to speak up, to 
stand up, to find a way to get in the 
way. As we continue the work for the 
people on this floor, we will do that in 
the legacy of John Robert Lewis. Thus, 
our power, that is our message. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the 56th an-
niversary of Bloody Sunday, the day my 
friend, mentor and predecessor, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis and hundreds of dem-
onstrators nearly lost their lives attempting to 
peacefully cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 
the interest of voting rights. 
The images of Black men, women being 
brutally beaten by police officers wielding billy 
clubs and tear gas are still haunting. The vio-
lence sent many of the activists to the hospital 
because of the extent of their injuries. Con-
gressman Lewis often remarked that he ‘‘shed 
a little blood’’ on that bridge that day, when his 
skull was crack by state troopers—people who 
were supposed to protect and serve. Why? 
Because, people who look like him, look like 
me, wanted the right to vote, the right to have 
a voice in our democracy. 
Bloody Sunday is still one of the darkest 
days in our nation’s history, but we commemo-
rate it because the courage and the violence 
Congressman Lewis and the over 600 march-
ers endured put the atrocities of this nation 
centerstage for the world to see and served as 
a catalyst for the Voting Rights Act being 
signed into law. 
More than five decades later, after that hor-
rific display of intimidation and overt suppres-
sion and signing of the VRA, we are still fight-
ing for voting rights for communities of color. 
It is shameful, that the same frustrations our 
ancestors felt—being denied at the ballot box 
for failing a literacy test, having to travel far 
distances to vote only to be told they were at 
the wrong polling location, having to pay a poll 
tax just to vote—are the same frustrations with 
our democratic process that people of color 
are experiencing today. These tactics are 
once again rearing their ugly head and it is 
disheartening that some of the same forces 
are trying to impose barriers to the ballot box 
using old tactics, new tricks. 
In Georgia, legislators just passed a bill that 
restricts access to absentee ballots, restricts 
ballot dropbox locations and early voting 
hours. We saw in the 2020 election how poll 
closures created long lines in Georgia. And, 
now, to add insult to injury, Georgia law-
makers are proposing making it a crime to 
give people food and water while they stand 
hours in line to vote—food and water! It is 
shameful and inhumane. 
There is not a day that goes by that I don’t 
think about Congressman Lewis. We all miss 
him dearly. This year, the Bloody Sunday Ju-
bilee weekend was not the same without him. 
However, it is bittersweet that he is not here 
to witness the country he loved, the country 
he had such high hopes for still making it 
harder—not easier—for people to vote. 
But as the first Black woman to represent 
Georgia’s 5th District, a seat formally held by 
Congressman Lewis and Ambassador Andrew 
Young, I came to Congress to assure my con-
stituents and the American people I will not let 
the trauma suffered on March 7, 1965 or bat-
tles fought for the sake for voting rights since 
then be in vain. The spirit of Congressman 
Lewis lives in all of us and we will protect his 
legacy. With our power, our message. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, in the 
weeks since President Biden took of-
fice, we have seen a dramatic reversal 
from the America First policies that 
we saw under President Trump. 
Mr. Speaker, after 4 years of policies 
that empowered middle-class Ameri-
cans to prosper, the working class is 
now getting the shaft under Joe Biden. 
And it is all happening through heavy- 
handed executive orders, not through 
legislation that reflects the voice of 
the people’s representatives. 
On day one, he acted recklessly to 
cancel the Keystone Pipeline, which 
provided thousands of good-paying en-
ergy jobs to the American people. 
From there, it was only worse. 
Rejoining the Paris climate agree-
ment, reentering the communist-com-
promised World Health Organization, 
and reducing security on our southern 
border were all executive actions that 
will make America less safe and pros-
perous. The President’s radical pro-
posal to grant amnesty to 11 million il-
legal immigrants, while 11 million 
Americans are unemployed, is the defi-
nition of putting Americans last. 
As it relates to immigration, this ad-
ministration’s reckless policies know 
no bounds. Due to President Biden’s 
loosening of security on our southern 
border, we are sending a message to the 
world that our immigration laws can 
be violated without consequence. 
Stopping construction of the wall 
and weakening enforcement, especially 
during a pandemic, is a huge national 
security and health risk to the Amer-
ican people. The Biden administration, 
specifically the Department of Home-
land Security, must answer questions 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form has asked about how they plan to 
keep the American people safe as they 
incentivize illegal immigration. 
Rather than focus on the unity out-
lined in his inaugural speech, President 
Biden has issued divisive executive or-
ders and hurt the safety of the Amer-
ican people. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for this Presi-
dent to work in a bipartisan way to 
take his duties seriously and enforce 
our immigration laws. It is also long 
past time to reopen schools and get 
Americans back to work. These are the 
things the American people expect us 
to be working on, not engaging in ex-
cessive partisanship. 
If we continue to see an approach to 
governing focused on pandering to our

CONGRATULATING GRAVES COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL 
JROTC 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the Graves County High 
School JROTC for their first-place fin-
ish in the All-Service Raider National 
Competition, 
Co-Ed 
Division, 
in 
Molena, Georgia. 
The cadets, led by Lieutenant Jason 
Caldwell, competed against 12 other 
schools, 
including 
military 
prep 
schools, in various physical activities. 
They should be proud of this out-
standing achievement. 
Over the summer, many competitions 
were canceled due to COVID–19, leaving 
each cadet to train individually to pre-
pare for the competition. This victory 
is a testament to the hard work and 
dedication of each of these students 
under unusual circumstances. 
Graves County was very well-rep-
resented by this talented group. The 
Junior ROTC program at Graves Coun-
ty High School cultivates leadership 
and service skills in its cadets that will 
benefit their local community, the 
First District of Kentucky, and our Na-
tion for many years to come. 
Once again, congratulations to the 
Graves County High School Junior 
ROTC for their victory in this very 
prestigious competition. 
HONORING ALLEN COUNTY JAILER LARRY PIPER 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor my good friend and a political 
powerhouse, Larry Piper, of Allen 
County, Kentucky, who recently re-
tired after serving as Allen County jail-
er since 2007. At the end of January, 
Larry stepped aside after faithfully 
serving his community for years in this 
important role. 
During his time in public office, 
Larry was known for always per-
forming his duties well, treating every-
one with respect, and doing what was 
asked of him. These traits are the hall-
mark of a good and honest public serv-
ant and describe Larry to a tee. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
my 
friend, Larry Piper, on a successful ca-
reer, and I wish him and his wife, Pa-
tricia, the very best in a well-earned 
retirement. 
ELECTION SYSTEM CONCERNS 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
talk a little bit about H.R. 1, which 
passed the House of Representatives 
last week. 
Speaker PELOSI and the Democrats 
made clear what their top priority in 
this new Congress would be: a swamp 
takeover of America’s elections. 
At its heart, this radical legislation 
is a massive Federal takeover that en-
ables ballot harvesting, requires mass 
mail-in 
voting, 
and 
uses 
taxpayer 
money to fund political campaigns. 
This bill, mistakenly named the ‘‘For 
the People Act,’’ is targeted toward 
helping politicians, not the people. At 
a time when the American people are 
struggling, why is helping politicians, 
like herself, Speaker PELOSI’s top pri-
ority? 
Whenever Washington gets involved, 
chaos and dysfunction follow closely 
behind. If somehow signed into law, 
H.R. 1 will follow in that familiar pat-
tern. 
Mr. Speaker, 2020 brought to light se-
rious concerns with our election sys-
tem. We saw dramatic delays, uncer-
tainty, and chaos from policies like 
universal mail-in voting and allowing 
votes to be counted for days after the 
election—and in the case of New York, 
weeks and months after the election. 
These concerns are real and present 
the need for fundamental reforms, but 
these reforms should be addressed by 
States, not Congress. And they should 
be the exact opposite of the disastrous 
H.R. 1. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation sanc-
tions the very practices that created 
chaos and uncertainty in the 2020 elec-
tion and sowed widespread voter dis-
trust. Banning voter ID laws and tak-
ing other actions to prevent States 
from promoting a safe and secure elec-
tion is a massive Washington power 
grab. 
The legislation allows absentee bal-
lots to come in up to 10 days—10 days— 
after the election date. Does anyone in 
this body think that is a good idea? 
Mr. Speaker, I would invite anyone 
in America to come to my home com-
munity of Monroe County, Kentucky, 
and come down on election night in 
2022—the primary election because it is 
a pretty Republican county, 91 percent 
Republican, to be exact. I would invite 
anyone to come to my community on 
election day when all the people who 
voted in person, which would be about 
95 percent of the voters, voted. Let’s 
say a magistrate, a constable, or a jail-
er candidate gets the most votes on 
that primary election day. Then, 10 
days later, a wad of absentees comes in 
the mail to the clerk, and lo and be-
hold, that person loses. 
I would invite anyone in America to 
come tell that magistrate candidate, 
constable candidate, or jailer can-
didate, ‘‘I am sorry. I know you won on 
election day, but 10 days later, these 
ballots came in and you lost.’’ 
That is what H.R. 1 would do. It 
makes no sense. This bill is nothing 
but a Democrat attempt to consolidate 
power. It places Washington in control 
of elections and enables voter fraud. 
And like every other priority bill we 
have seen from this body, it is a dis-
grace for the taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I proudly voted against 
H.R. 1, as did every Republican in this 
body. Let’s hope, when that bill makes 
its way to the Senate, that there are 
some Senators with some common 
sense on the Democrat side, like JOE 
MANCHIN, who will stand up for not just 
the American taxpayer but the Amer-
ican citizen and reject H.R. 1.

HONORING PADUCAH COMMUNITY KITCHEN 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Paducah Community 
Kitchen for the outsized role they have 
played in helping the city of Paducah 
weather some of our storms of this past 
year. 
This Christ-centered nonprofit pro-
vides crucial services, like free meals 
and housing, along with laundry and 
shower services. Their efforts to care 
for the needy have been instrumental 
in helping individuals and families fac-
ing hardships. In 2020 alone, they dra-
matically increased the number of 
meals served daily, a critical need due 
to the economic fallout from the 
COVID pandemic. 
The Paducah Community Kitchen 
would not be what it is without the 
caring and dedicated volunteers who 
spend a significant amount of time 
serving their community. These hum-
ble volunteers share love and compas-
sion by lending a helping hand to their 
friends and neighbors. The Paducah 
Community Kitchen’s volunteers, spon-
sors, and donors should be commended 
for all they have done to support their 
friends and neighbors. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of everyone in 
Kentucky’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, I want to thank them for all of 
their compassionate work to help so 
many families in need. 
ANTI-GUN CONTROL 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
talk about something very important 
to the people of Kentucky, and that is 
the Second Amendment. 
With President Biden taking office, 
there are renewed concerns with the 
safety of Second Amendment rights of 
law-abiding citizens and Americans. 
Given his longtime record of pushing 
extreme gun control measures through 
Congress, and given his stated intent 
to enact those very policies, my con-
stituents have every right to be con-
cerned. 
This is especially true given that 
House Democrats are putting bills on 
the floor this week that are the first 
step in rolling back our basic constitu-
tional rights. These proposals come in 
addition to the bills which implement 
new registration requirements for fire-
arms and ammunition, and disallow 
adults under 21 from owning firearms. 
So you can join the United States 
military and fight, and even die on the 
battlefield when you are 18, but you 
can’t own firearms until you are 21. Se-
riously? 
These radical proposals coming from 
the Democrat majority infringe on the 
basic rights and privacy of gun owners, 
and should be stopped in their tracks. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose these 
measures, which are extremely radical 
and the opposite of what Kentuckians 
sent me to Congress to do. Instead, I 
will continue to work to support and 
promote legislation that upholds the 
fundamental rights found in the Sec-
ond Amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of 
the law-abiding gun owners in Ken-
tucky, 
whose 
continued 
advocacy 
makes a real difference in the fight 
against gun control.

RECOGNIZING SARAH BRIDGES 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Sarah Bridges of Reidland, 
Kentucky, a Marshal County High 
School student who is using her talent 
at sewing to provide swaddling blan-
kets for infants at the ICU. 
According to recent reporting from 
the Paducah Sun, Sarah has been busy 
crafting swaddling blankets for Baptist 
Health Paducah’s neonatal intensive 
care unit. She rose to this challenge 
and produced over 20 blankets in the 
last 2 months, which are used by nurses 
at Baptist Health Paducah to meet the 
comfort needs of local infants. 
Sarah’s drive to use her talents to fill 
a vital need reflect her high character 
and desire to positively impact her 
community and region. Given her ex-
tensive track record of community 
service and school involvement, it is no 
surprise that she is now giving back in 
this admirable way. 
On behalf of the entire First Congres-
sional District of Kentucky, I thank 
Sarah Bridges for this outstanding and 
caring project she has taken on. 
HONORING OCIE KEY ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mrs. Ocie Key of the 
First District of Kentucky, who is 
turning 100 years old on March 18. 
Mrs. Key was born in Burkesville, 
Kentucky, and continues to reside in 
Cumberland County. 
In 1939, Mrs. Key married Paul, and 
together they have three daughters, six 
grandchildren, and five great-grand-
children. 
She is a lover of quilting, sewing, and 
basket-making, and enjoys spending 
time with family and friends. 
Mrs. Key is a woman of faith and a 
member of the Christian Chapel Church 
of Christ in Burkesville, Kentucky. She 
is also the queen of the Cumberland 
County Red Hat Society and has been a 
member of the Cumberland County 
Homemakers for over 50 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rep-
resent Mrs. Ocie Key, and I join with 
everyone in Cumberland County and 
throughout 
the 
Commonwealth 
in 
wishing her a very happy 100th birth-
day. 
NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY IN SPENDING 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to talk about transparency in gov-
ernment spending. That is one of the 
main objectives of the House Oversight 
and Reform Committee. Not only do we 
ensure the prevention of waste, fraud, 
abuse, and mismanagement in govern-
ment, we also want and expect govern-
ment transparency, just like the people 
who send us here to be their voice in 
Washington. 
There is no greater disgrace to the 
taxpayers than the nearly $28 trillion 
in debt we are facing as a nation. But 
instead of taking this burden we are 
leaving to our children and grand-
children seriously, Democrats are bar-
reling through a partisan $2 trillion 
package through Congress, $2 trillion 
of deficit spending. 
Congress has already spent $4 trillion 
to fight the coronavirus in a bipartisan 
manner. And $1 trillion of that $4 tril-
lion we have already appropriated is 
unspent. That is why I introduced a 
resolution 
with 
Budget 
Committee 
Ranking Member JASON SMITH requir-
ing President Biden to provide this 
body with information about the $1 
trillion in unspent funds. 
Congress should have the informa-
tion before we spend more taxpayer 
money. The American people must 
have transparency and accountability 
for how their money is spent. 
People find that hard to believe, that 
25 percent of the last COVID relief bill 
hasn’t been spent, and we don’t have a 
full accounting of where that money is, 
where the unspent funds are, where it 
is going, why it hasn’t been spent. 
But we are going to appropriate an-
other $2 trillion? 
We are not. You all are. Two trillion 
dollars more of deficit spending. 
Transparency 
and 
responsibility 
weren’t on the minds of the House last 
week when the Democrats passed in a 
partisan manner $2 trillion additional 
deficit spending. 
This is not responsible governing, es-
pecially in light of concerns from 
economists that the Democrats’ mas-
sive spending bill most likely will 
cause an economic crash. It is defi-
nitely causing inflation. 
If you have gone to fill up gas, if you 
have gone to Lowe’s or Home Depot or 
anywhere for home improvements, or if 
you tried to buy any commodities, you 
have gone to refinance your house, you 
are starting to see inflation. 
And with the $2 trillion in that fund, 
along with the $1 trillion that still 
hasn’t been spent, you are going to cre-
ate the kind of inflation that I studied 
about in the 1970s. 
This bill wasn’t about relief for 
Americans. I have supported targeted 
relief, including the direct stimulus 
checks supported by President Trump. 
I voted for the $2,000. I was one of the 
few Republicans that voted for the 
$2,000 in direct stimulus to the individ-
uals who qualified economically. That 
is called targeted relief. 
I also support funding to help with 
vaccine distribution and actually win 
the fight against COVID–19, but only 9 
percent of NANCY
PELOSI’s and Joe 
Biden’s so-called relief bill went to-
ward fighting COVID, and less than 1 
percent went towards vaccines. In-
stead, the focus was on satisfying the 
far left political agenda. 
This relief measure inserted unre-
lated pork projects in NANCY PELOSI’s 
backyard and bailed out blue States, 
which chose lockdowns over recovery. 
In other words, that COVID bill re-
warded the States that kept their 
economies locked down, the States 
that have the highest unemployment 
rate, and they got rewarded with this 
blue State bailout bill. 
The no-strings attached, $350 billion 
in State bailout money comes at a 
time when, collectively, State revenues 
have hardly budged. 
For example, California has a $15 bil-
lion budget surplus. We played a video 
in the House Oversight Committee 
where 
California 
Governor 
Gavin 
Newsom was bragging about his $10 bil-
lion budget surplus. But you want to 
send more money to California. 
My home State of Kentucky saw a 
higher tax revenue during the pan-
demic months of 2020 than they did 
during the same period of 2019. That is 
because we had a strong economy. If 
you take COVID away, it was the 
strongest economy in my lifetime. The 
biggest impediment to the economy 
over the past year has been mayors and 
governors who have locked their cities 
and States down. 
The truth is, Congress has already 
provided 
States 
with 
funding 
for 
COVID expenses through the CARES 
Act. Now we must look out for our tax-
payers. This includes our senior citi-
zens. Instead of helping our citizens 
who are most vulnerable to the virus, 
Biden’s bailout bill smacks Kentucky 
seniors with a $6.4 billion Medicare cut 
over the next 10 years. That is not an 
America-first proposal. 
Before Democrats even attempt to 
spend another dime of taxpayer dollars, 
Congress needs to act to prevent gov-
ernment waste, fraud, and abuse; and 
we need to refocus our attention on ac-
tually helping the American people. 
I hope to see the United States Sen-
ate exercise the due diligence that tax-
payers deserve, and that the House did 
not provide, in only passing funding 
that is targeted directly to the pan-
demic. 
HONORING VETERAN THOMAS BRUZAN 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and legacy 
of Thomas Bruzan, who passed away in 
December at his home in Cadiz, Ken-
tucky, at the age of 71, after a lifetime 
of service to his country. 
Tom was a decorated Marine Corps 
veteran, who received a Purple Heart 
for his service in Operation Meade dur-
ing the Vietnam war. After his mili-
tary service, Tom assisted combat vet-
erans as a volunteer at Pennyroyal 
Veterans Center in Christian County. 
Tom was also a member of the Amer-
ican Legion and a charitable giver to 
Nonnie’s Place, a nonprofit in Lyon 
County, 
Kentucky, 
which 
supports 
women and mothers going through 
hard times. 
Mr. Speaker, I join Tom’s family, 
friends, and all impacted by his sac-
rifice, in celebrating his life of devoted 
service to our country and the First 
Congressional District of Kentucky. 
Tom was a true American patriot, and 
his bravery and kindness will not be 
forgotten.

EARMARKS 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
conclude my remarks with mentioning 
an issue that will be debated by my

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1106 
March 8, 2021 
matter, where I stand on this issue, and 
that is the issue of earmarks and 
whether or not to end the ban on con-
gressional earmarks. 
I am opposed to that for many rea-
sons. First of all, I have learned this 
over the 4 years I have served in Con-
gress: Congress is not a democratic 
place, especially when it comes to 
money. We are going to have a debate— 
and it is going to be in the press— 
about whether or not to bring back 
earmarks. 
But, in fact, there have always been 
earmarks. This last COVID bill had 
earmarks in there for Speaker PELOSI. 
The CARES Act had earmarks for leg-
islative leaders on both sides, Demo-
crats and Republicans. 
Bringing back earmarks will only 
give certain people the ability to spend 
more money at the expense of a major-
ity of Members, and I can’t believe that 
Republicans would put a whole lot of 
consideration 
into 
supporting 
the 
bringing back of congressional ear-
marks. 
Another reason why I oppose ear-
marks is common sense. We have to get 
serious about deficit spending. We are 
$28 trillion in Federal debt. 
Congress has to set the example. And 
the example is standing up and saying 
that we are going to do more earmarks, 
bring earmarks back, bring back pork? 
More pork? 
That is a terrible example, and some-
body has to stand up for the American 
taxpayer. Somebody has to stand up 
for the children and grandchildren who 
are going to inherit this $28 trillion in 
debt, and I want to stand up for those 
people and oppose earmarks. 
Lastly, as the top Republican on the 
House Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee, one thing I have studied in 
oversight, not just in Congress, but in 
my time in the Kentucky General As-
sembly and in my study of history and 
American politics, is that there is al-
ways a direct correlation between ear-
marks and corruption. 
I said that to some Members, and 
they said: Oh, no, my earmarks won’t 
be corrupt, they are going to go to 
building projects. 
The corruption is seldom with the 
municipalities. The corruption is with 
the contractors and the subcontractors 
in the pork projects. There is usually a 
direct correlation between earmarks 
and campaign contributions. 
At a time when we have got too 
many special interests with their paws 
in the pot in Washington, bringing 
back earmarks is a bad idea. 
I want everyone in Kentucky to 
know exactly where I stand on that 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
PUBLICATION OF COMMITTEE 
RULES 
RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES FOR THE 
117TH CONGRESS 
COMMITTEE ON RULES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 8, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to clause 
2(a)(2) of rule XI, the Committee on Rules’ 
rules of procedure for the 117th Congress are 
transmitted herewith. They were adopted on 
January 12, 2021 by a nonrecord vote and 
amended on February 2, 2021 by a nonrecord 
vote. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, 
House Committee on Rules. 
RULE 1.—GENERAL PROVISIONS 
(a) The Rules of the House are the rules of 
the Committee and its subcommittees so far 
as applicable, except that a motion to recess 
from day to day, and a motion to dispense 
with the first reading (in full) of a bill or res-
olution, if printed copies are available, are 
non-debatable privileged motions in the 
Committee. A proposed investigative or 
oversight report shall be considered as read 
if it has been available to the members of the 
Committee for at least 24 hours (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays except

of any current or proposed conduct of such 
Member, officer, or employee. 
(c) The Office of Advice and Education may 
provide information and guidance regarding 
laws, rules, regulations, and other standards 
of conduct applicable to Members, officers,

ities. 
(d) In general, the Committee shall provide 
a written opinion to an individual only in re-
sponse to a written request, and the written 
opinion shall address the conduct only of the 
inquiring individual, or of persons for whom 
the inquiring individual is responsible as em-
ploying authority. 
(e) A written request for an opinion shall 
be addressed to the Chair of the Committee

ploying authority. A representative shall 
disclose to the Committee the identity of the 
principal on whose behalf advice is being

4(c), 4(e), or 4(h), the next ranking member of 
the requester’s party is authorized to act in 
lieu of the requester. 
(j) The Committee shall keep confidential 
any request for advice from a Member, offi-
cer, or employee, as well as any response

ing the request, and any Committee advisory 
opinion or travel letter issued to that indi-
vidual in response. The Committee shall not 
release any internal Committee staff work 
product, communications, or notes in re-
sponse to such a request, except as author-
ized by the Committee. 
(k) The Committee may take no adverse 
action in regard to any conduct that has 
been undertaken in reliance on a written 
opinion if the conduct conforms to the spe-
cific facts addressed in the opinion. 
(l) Information provided to the Committee 
by a Member, officer, or employee seeking 
advice regarding prospective conduct may 
not be used as the basis for initiating an in-
vestigation under clause 3(a)(2) or clause 3(b) 
of Rule XI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, if such Member, officer, or em-
ployee acts in good faith in accordance with 
the written advice of the Committee.

clause 5 of House Rule XXV (the House gift

shall be treated in all respects like any other 
request for a written opinion. 
(n) A written request for a waiver of clause 
5 of House Rule XXV (the House gift rule) 
shall specify the nature of the waiver being 
sought and the specific circumstances justi-
fying the waiver. 
(o) An employee seeking a waiver of time 
limits applicable to travel paid for by a pri-
vate source shall include with the request 
evidence that the employing authority is 
aware of the request. In any other instance 
where proposed employee conduct may re-
flect on the performance of official duties,

quester submit evidence that the employing 
authority knows of the conduct.

mittee shall coordinate with the Clerk of the 
House of Representatives, Legislative Re-
source Center, to assure that appropriate in-

Title I of the Ethics in Government Act filed 
by Members of the Board of the Office of 
Congressional Ethics that are forwarded to 
the Committee by the Clerk shall not be sub-
ject to paragraphs (d) through (q) of this

ness and completeness of filings by Members

ics office. 
(d) The Chair and Ranking Minority Mem-
ber are authorized to grant on behalf of the 
Committee requests for reasonable exten-
sions of time for the filing of Financial Dis-
closure Statements. Any such request must

may be granted by the Committee only in 
extraordinary circumstances. Such exten-
sions for one individual in a calendar year 
shall not exceed a total of 90 days per State-
ment, including any amendment required by 
the Committee in accordance with clause

izing a nonincumbent candidate to file a

cient action to withdraw as a candidate be-
fore the date on which that individual’s Fi-
nancial Disclosure Statement is due under 
the Ethics in Government Act shall not be

shall not be excused from filing a Financial 
Disclosure Statement when withdrawal as a

required by law to be made public, shall be 
forwarded to the Legislative Resource Center 
for such purpose. 
(j) The Committee shall designate staff 
who shall review reports required to be filed 
under Title I of the Ethics in Government 
Act and, based upon information contained 
therein, indicate in a form and manner pre-
scribed by the Committee whether the State-
ment appears substantially accurate and 
complete and the filer appears to be in com-
pliance with applicable laws and rules. 
(k) Each report required to be filed under 
Title I of the Ethics in Government Act shall 
be reviewed within 60 days after the date of 
filing. 
(l) If the reviewing staff believes that addi-
tional information is required because (1) the 
report required to be filed under Title I of 
the Ethics in Government Act appears not 
substantially accurate or complete, or (2) the 
filer may not be in compliance with applica-
ble laws or rules, then the reporting indi-
vidual shall be notified in writing of the ad-
ditional information believed to be required, 
or of the law or rule with which the report-
ing individual does not appear to be in com-
pliance. Such notice shall also state the time 
within which a response is to be submitted. 
Any such notice shall remain confidential.

plete, or that other action is required, shall 
submit the necessary information or take 
appropriate action. Any amendment may be

ment Act or an explanatory letter addressed 
to the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

Act shall review any amendment thereto. 
(o) Within the time specified, including 
any extension granted in accordance with 
clause (d), a reporting individual who does 
not agree with the Committee that the re-
port required to be filed under Title I of the 
Ethics in Government Act is deficient or 
that other action is required, shall be pro-
vided an opportunity to respond orally or in 
writing. If the explanation is accepted, a 
copy of the response, if written, or a note 
summarizing an oral response, shall be re-
tained in Committee files with the original 
report.

a majority of its members, that there is rea-
son to believe that an individual has will-
fully failed to file a report required to be 
filed under Title I of the Ethics in Govern-
ment Act or has willfully falsified or will-
fully failed to file information required to be 
reported, then the Committee shall refer the 
name of the individual, together with the 
evidence supporting its finding, to the Attor-
ney General pursuant to section 104(b) of the

tained only for the duration of that par-
ticular investigation or proceeding.

(c) Information offered as a complaint by a 
Member of the House of Representatives may 
be transmitted directly to the Committee. 
(d) Information offered as a complaint by 
an individual not a Member of the House

the complainant has provided an exact copy 
of the filed complaint and all attachments to 
the respondent(s).

regulatory authorities, or when the Com-
mittee determines that it is appropriate for 
the conduct alleged in the complaint to be 
reviewed initially by law enforcement or reg-
ulatory authorities. 
(g) A complaint may not be amended with-
out leave of the Committee. Otherwise, any 
new allegations of improper conduct must be 
submitted in a new complaint that independ-
ently meets the procedural requirements of 
the Rules of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee’s Rules. 
(h) The Committee shall not accept, and 
shall return to the complainant, any com-
plaint submitted within the 60 days before a 
Federal, State, or local election in which the 
subject of the complaint is a candidate. 
(i) The Committee shall not consider a 
complaint, nor shall any investigation be un-
dertaken by the Committee, of any alleged 
violation which occurred before the third 
previous Congress unless the Committee de-
termines that the alleged violation is di-
rectly related to an alleged violation which 
occurred in a more recent Congress. 
RULE 16. DUTIES OF COMMITTEE CHAIR AND 
RANKING MINORITY MEMBER 
(a) Whenever information offered as a com-
plaint is submitted to the Committee, the 
Chair and Ranking Minority Member shall 
have 14 calendar days or 5 legislative days, 
whichever occurs first, to determine whether 
the information meets the requirements of 
the Committee’s rules for what constitutes a 
complaint. 
(b) Whenever the Chair and Ranking Mi-
nority Member jointly determine that infor-
mation submitted to the Committee meets 
the requirements of the Committee’s rules 
for what constitutes a complaint, they shall 
have 45 calendar days or 5 legislative days, 
whichever is later, after the date that the 
Chair and Ranking Minority Member deter-
mine that information filed meets the re-
quirements of the Committee’s rules for 
what constitutes a complaint, unless the 
Committee by an affirmative vote of a ma-
jority of its members votes otherwise, to— 
(1) recommend to the Committee that it 
dispose of the complaint, or any portion 
thereof, in any manner that does not require 
action by the House, which may include dis-
missal of the complaint or resolution of the 
complaint by a letter to the Member, officer, 
or employee of the House against whom the 
complaint is made; 
(2) 
establish 
an 
investigative 
sub-
committee; or 
(3) request that the Committee extend the 
applicable 45-calendar day period when they 
determine more time is necessary in order to 
make a recommendation under paragraph (1) 
or (2) of Rule 16(b). 
(c) The Chair and Ranking Minority Mem-
ber may jointly gather additional informa-
tion concerning alleged conduct which is the 
basis of a complaint or of information of-
fered as a complaint until they have estab-
lished an investigative subcommittee or the 
Chair or Ranking Minority Member has 
placed on the agenda the issue of whether to 
establish an investigative subcommittee. 
(d) If the Chair and Ranking Minority 
Member jointly determine that information 
submitted to the Committee meets the re-
quirements of the Committee rules for what 
constitutes a complaint, and the complaint 
is not disposed of within 45 calendar days or 
5 legislative days, whichever is later, and no 
additional 45-day extension is made, then 
they shall establish an investigative sub-
committee and forward the complaint, or 
any portion thereof, to that subcommittee 
for its consideration. If at any time during 
the time period either the Chair or Ranking 
Minority Member places on the agenda the 
issue of whether to establish an investigative 
subcommittee, then an investigative sub-
committee may be established only by an af-
firmative vote of a majority of the members 
of the Committee. 
(e) Whenever the Chair and Ranking Mi-
nority Member jointly determine that infor-
mation submitted to the Committee does not 
meet the requirements for what constitutes 
a complaint set forth in the Committee 
rules, they may (1) return the information to 
the complainant with a statement that it 
fails to meet the requirements for what con-
stitutes a complaint set forth in the Com-
mittee’s rules; or (2) recommend to the Com-
mittee that it authorize the establishment of 
an investigative subcommittee. 
RULE 17. PROCESSING OF COMPLAINTS 
(a) If a complaint is in compliance with 
House and Committee Rules, a copy of the 
complaint and the Committee Rules shall be 
forwarded to the respondent(s) within 5 days 
with notice that the complaint conforms to 
the applicable rules. 
(b) A respondent may, within 30 days of the 
Committee’s notification in clause (a), pro-
vide to the Committee any information rel-
evant to a complaint filed with the Com-
mittee. The respondent may submit a writ-
ten statement in response to the complaint. 
Such a statement shall be signed by the re-
spondent. If the statement is prepared by 
counsel for the respondent, the respondent 
shall sign a representation that the respond-
ent has reviewed the response and agrees 
with the factual assertions contained there-
in. 
(c) The Committee staff may request infor-
mation from a respondent or obtain addi-
tional information relevant to the case from 
other sources prior to the establishment of 
an investigative subcommittee only when so 
directed by the Chair and Ranking Minority 
Member. 
(d) The respondent(s) shall be notified in 
writing regarding the Chair and Ranking Mi-
nority Member’s determination under Rule 
16(e) or the Committee’s decision either to 
dismiss the complaint or to create an inves-
tigative subcommittee. 
RULE 17A. REFERRALS FROM THE BOARD OF THE 
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS 
(a) The Committee has exclusive jurisdic-
tion over the interpretation, administration, 
and enforcement of the Code of Official Con-
duct pursuant to clause 1(g) of House Rule X. 
Receipt of referrals from the Board under 
this rule does not limit the Committee’s dis-
cretion to address referrals in any way 
through the appropriate procedures author-
ized by Committee Rules. The Committee 
shall review the report and findings trans-
mitted by the Board without prejudice or 
presumptions as to the merit of the allega-
tions. 
(b)(1) Whenever the Committee receives ei-
ther (A) a referral containing a written re-
port and any findings and supporting docu-
mentation from the Board; or (B) a referral 
from the Board pursuant to a request under 
Rule 17A(k), the Chair shall have 45 calendar 
days or 5 legislative days after the date the 
referral is received, whichever is later, to 
make public the report and findings of the 
Board unless the Chair and Ranking Minor-
ity Member jointly decide, or the Committee 
votes, to withhold such information for not 
more than one additional 45-day period. 
(2) At least one calendar day before the 
Committee makes public any report and 
findings of the Board, the Chair shall notify 
in writing the Board and the Member, offi-
cer, 23 or employee who is the subject of the 
referral of the impending public release of 
these documents. At the same time, the 
Chair shall transmit a copy of any public 
statement on the Committee’s disposition of 
the matter and any accompanying Com-
mittee report to the individual who is the 
subject of the referral. 
(3) All public statements and reports and 
findings of the Board that are required to be 
made public under this Rule shall be posted 
on the Committee’s website. 
(c) If the OCE report and findings are with-
held for an additional 45-day period pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(1), the Chair shall— 
(1) make a public statement on the day of 
such decision or vote that the matter re-
ferred from the Board has been extended; and 
(2) make public the written report and 
findings pursuant to paragraph (b) upon the 
termination of such additional period. 
(d) If the Board transmits a report with a 
recommendation to dismiss or noting a mat-
ter as unresolved due to a tie vote, and the 
matter is extended for an additional period 
as provided in paragraph (b), the Committee 
is not required to make a public statement 
that the matter has been extended pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(1). 
(e) If the Committee votes to dismiss a 
matter referred from the Board, the Com-
mittee is not required to make public the 
written report and findings of the Board pur-
suant to paragraph (c) unless the Commit-
tee’s vote is inconsistent with the rec-
ommendation of the Board. A vote by the 
Committee to dismiss a matter is not consid-
ered inconsistent with a report from the 
Board that the matter is unresolved by the 
Board due to a tie vote. 
(f) Except as provided by paragraph (g): 
(1) If the Committee establishes an inves-
tigative subcommittee respecting any mat-
ter referred by the Board, then the report 
and findings of the Board shall not be made 
public until the conclusion of the investiga-
tive subcommittee process. The Committee 
shall issue a public statement noting the es-
tablishment 
of 
an 
investigative 
sub-
committee, which shall include the name of 
the Member, officer, or employee who is the 
subject of the inquiry, and shall set forth the 
alleged violation. 
(2) If any such investigative subcommittee 
does not conclude its review within one year 
after the Board’s referral, then the Com-
mittee shall make public the report of the 
Board no later than one year after the refer-
ral. If the investigative subcommittee does 
not conclude its review before the end of the 
Congress in which the report of the Board is 
made public, the Committee shall make pub-
lic any findings of the Board on the last day 
of that Congress. 
(g) If the vote of the Committee is a tie or 
the Committee fails to act by the close of 
any applicable period(s) under this rule, the 
report and the findings of the Board shall be 
made public by the Committee, along with a 
public statement by the Chair explaining the 
status of the matter. 
(h)(1) If the Committee agrees to a request 
from an appropriate law enforcement or reg-
ulatory authority to defer taking action on a 
matter referred by the Board under para-
graph (b)— 
(A) The Committee is not required to make 
public the written report and findings of the 
Board pursuant to paragraph (c), except that 
if the recommendation of the Board is that 
the matter requires further review, the Com-
mittee shall make public the written report 
of the Board but not the findings; and 
(B) The Committee shall make a public 
statement that it is deferring taking action 
on the matter at the request of such law en-
forcement or regulatory authority within 
one day (excluding weekends and public holi-
days) of the day that the Committee agrees 
to the request. 
(2) If the Committee has not acted on the 
matter within one year of the date the public 
statement described in paragraph (h)(1)(B) is 
released, the Committee shall make a public

statement that it continues to defer taking 
action on the matter. The Committee shall 
make a new statement upon the expiration 
of each succeeding one-year period during 
which the Committee has not acted on the 
matter. 
(i) The Committee shall not accept, and 
shall return to the Board, any referral from 
the Board within 60 days before a Federal, 
State, or local election in which the subject 
of the referral is a candidate. 
(j) The Committee may postpone any re-
porting requirement under this rule that 
falls within that 60–day period until after the 
date of the election in which the subject of 
the referral is a candidate. For purposes of 
calculating any applicable period under this 
Rule, any days within the 60–day period be-
fore such an election and the date of the 
election shall not be counted. 
(k)(1) At any time after the Committee re-
ceives written notification from the Board of 
the Office of Congressional Ethics that the 
Board is undertaking a review of alleged con-
duct of any Member, officer, or employee of 
the House at a time when the Committee is 
investigating, or has completed an investiga-
tion of the same matter, the Committee may 
so notify the Board in writing and request 
that the Board cease its review and refer the 
matter to the Committee for its consider-
ation immediately. The Committee shall 
also notify the Board in writing if the Com-
mittee has not reached a final resolution of 
the matter or has not referred the matter to 
the appropriate Federal or State authorities 
by the end of any applicable time period 
specified in Rule 17A (including any permis-
sible extension). 
(2) The Committee may not request a sec-
ond referral of the matter from the Board if 
the Committee has notified the Board that it 
is unable to resolve the matter previously re-
quested pursuant to this section. The Board 
may subsequently send a referral regarding a 
matter previously requested and returned by 
the Committee after the conclusion of the 
Board’s review process. 
RULE 18. COMMITTEE-INITIATED INQUIRY OR 
INVESTIGATION 
(a) Notwithstanding the absence of a filed 
complaint, the Committee may consider any 
information in its possession indicating that 
a Member, officer, or employee may have 
committed a violation of the Code of Official 
Conduct or any law, rule, regulation, or 
other standard of conduct applicable to the 
conduct of such Member, officer, or em-
ployee in the performance of the duties or 
the discharge of the responsibilities of such 
individual. The Chair and Ranking Minority 
Member may jointly gather additional infor-
mation concerning such an alleged violation 
by a Member, officer, or employee unless and 
until an investigative subcommittee has 
been established. The Chair and Ranking Mi-
nority Member may also jointly take appro-
priate action consistent with Committee 
Rules to resolve the matter. 
(b) If the Committee votes to establish an 
investigative subcommittee, the Committee 
shall proceed in accordance with Rule 19. 
(c) Any written request by a Member, offi-
cer, or employee of the House of Representa-
tives that the Committee conduct an inves-
tigation into such person’s own conduct 
shall be considered in accordance with sub-
section (a) of this Rule. 
(d) An investigation shall not be under-
taken regarding any alleged violation that 
occurred before the third previous Congress 
unless a majority of the Committee deter-
mines that the alleged violation is directly 
related to an alleged violation that occurred 
in a more recent Congress. 
(e)(1) An inquiry shall be undertaken by an 
investigative subcommittee with regard to 
any felony conviction of a Member, officer, 
or employee of the House of Representatives 
in a Federal, State, or local court who has 
been sentenced. Notwithstanding this provi-
sion, the Chair and Ranking Minority Mem-
ber have the discretion to gather informa-
tion pursuant to subsection (a) of this Rule, 
and the Committee has the discretion to ini-
tiate an inquiry upon an affirmative vote of 
a majority of the members of the Com-
mittee, at any time prior to conviction or 
sentencing. 
(2) Not later than 30 days after a Member 
of the House is indicted or otherwise for-
mally charged with criminal conduct in any 
Federal, State, or local court, the Com-
mittee shall either initiate an inquiry upon 
a majority vote of the members of the Com-
mittee or submit a report to the House de-
scribing its reasons for not initiating an in-
quiry and describing the actions, if any, that 
the Committee has taken in response to the 
allegations. 
(3) In addition to any other evidence which 
the 
Committee 
or 
investigative 
sub-
committee may consider, the Committee or 
investigative subcommittee may take into 
evidence any information related to the sub-
ject of an investigation contained in trial 
transcripts and all exhibits admitted into 
evidence at trial. 
RULE 19. INVESTIGATIVE SUBCOMMITTEE 
(a)(1) Upon the establishment of an inves-
tigative subcommittee, the Chair and Rank-
ing Minority Member of the Committee shall 
designate four members (with equal rep-
resentation from the majority and minority 
parties) to serve as an investigative sub-
committee to undertake an inquiry. Mem-
bers of the Committee and Members of the 
House selected pursuant to clause 5(a)(4)(A) 
of Rule X of the House of Representatives 
are eligible for appointment to an investiga-
tive subcommittee, as determined by the 
Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the 
Committee. At the time of appointment, the 
Chair shall designate one member of the sub-
committee to serve as the Chair and the 
Ranking Minority Member shall designate 
one member of the subcommittee to serve as 
the ranking minority member of the inves-
tigative subcommittee. The Chair and Rank-
ing Minority Member of the Committee may 
serve as members of an investigative sub-
committee, but may not serve as non-voting, 
ex-officio members. 
(2) A respondent shall be notified of the 
membership 
of 
the 
investigative 
sub-
committee and shall have 10 days after such 
notice is transmitted to object to the par-
ticipation of any subcommittee member. 
Such objection shall be in writing and must 
be on the grounds that the subcommittee 
member cannot render an impartial and un-
biased decision. The members of the Com-
mittee shall engage in a collegial discussion 
regarding such objection. The subcommittee 
member against whom the objection is made 
shall be the sole judge of any disqualifica-
tion and may choose to seek disqualification 
from participating in the inquiry pursuant 
to Rule 9(e). 
(b) In an inquiry undertaken by an inves-
tigative subcommittee— 
(1) All proceedings, including the taking of 
testimony, shall be conducted in executive 
session and all evidence or testimony pro-
duced pursuant to subpoena or otherwise 
shall be deemed to have been taken or pro-
duced in executive session. 
(2) 
The 
investigative 
subcommittee, 
through any of its members or the staff, 
shall ask the respondent(s) and all witnesses 
whether they intend to be represented by 
counsel. If so, the respondent or witnesses or 
their legal representatives shall provide 
written designation of counsel. A respondent 
or witness who is represented by counsel 
shall not be questioned in the absence of 
counsel unless an explicit waiver is obtained. 
(3) The subcommittee shall provide the re-
spondent(s) an opportunity to present, orally 
or in writing, a statement, which must be 
under oath or affirmation, regarding the al-
legations and any other relevant questions 
arising out of the inquiry. 
(4) The staff may interview witnesses, ex-
amine documents and other evidence, and re-
quest that submitted statements be under 
oath or affirmation and that documents be 
certified as to their authenticity and accu-
racy. 
(5) The subcommittee, by a majority vote 
of its members, may require, by subpoena or 
otherwise, the attendance and testimony of 
witnesses and the production of such books, 
records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, 
documents, and other items as it deems nec-
essary to the conduct of the inquiry. Unless 
the Committee otherwise provides, the sub-
poena power shall rest in the Chair and 
Ranking Minority Member of the Committee 
and a subpoena shall be issued upon the re-
quest of the investigative subcommittee. 
(6) Required testimony shall be given 
under oath or affirmation. The form of the 
oath or affirmation shall be: ‘‘Do you sol-
emnly swear (or affirm) that the testimony 
you will give before this subcommittee in 
the matter now under consideration will be 
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 
the truth (so help you God)?’’ The oath or af-
firmation shall be administered by the Chair 
or any individual designated by the Chair to 
administer oaths. 
(c) During the inquiry, the procedure re-
specting the admissibility of evidence and 
rulings shall be as follows: 
(1) Any relevant evidence shall be admis-
sible unless the evidence is privileged under 
the precedents of the House of Representa-
tives. 
(2) The Chair of the subcommittee or other 
presiding member at any investigative sub-
committee proceeding shall rule upon any 
question of admissibility or relevance of evi-
dence, motion, procedure, or any other mat-
ter, and may direct any witness to answer 
any question under penalty of contempt. A 
witness, witness counsel, or a member of the 
subcommittee may appeal any rulings to the 
members present at that proceeding. A ma-
jority vote of the members present at such 
proceeding on such appeal shall govern the 
question of admissibility, and no appeal shall 
lie to the Committee. 
(3) Whenever a person is determined by a 
majority vote to be in contempt of the sub-
committee, the matter may be referred to 
the Committee to determine whether to refer 
the matter to the House of Representatives 
for consideration. 
(4) Committee counsel may, subject to sub-
committee approval, enter into stipulations 
with a respondent and/or the respondent’s 
counsel as to facts that are not in dispute. 
(d) Upon an affirmative vote of a majority 
of the subcommittee members, and an af-
firmative vote of a majority of the full Com-
mittee, an investigative subcommittee may 
expand the scope of its inquiry. 
(e) Upon completion of the inquiry, the 
staff shall draft for the investigative sub-
committee a report that shall contain a com-
prehensive summary of the information re-
ceived regarding the alleged violations. 
(f) Upon completion of the inquiry, an in-
vestigative subcommittee, by a majority 
vote of its members, may adopt a Statement 
of Alleged Violation if it determines that 
there is substantial reason to believe that a 
violation of the Code of Official Conduct, or 
of a law, rule, regulation, or other standard 
of conduct applicable to the performance of 
official duties or the discharge of official re-
sponsibilities by a Member, officer, or em-
ployee of the House of Representatives has

leged, such Statement shall be divided into 
separate counts. Each count shall relate to a 
separate violation, shall contain a plain and 
concise statement of the alleged facts of 
such violation, and shall include a reference 
to the provision of the Code of Official Con-
duct or law, rule, regulation, or other appli-
cable standard of conduct governing the per-
formance of duties or discharge of respon-
sibilities alleged to have been violated. A 
copy of such Statement shall be transmitted 
to the respondent and the respondent’s coun-
sel. 
(g) If the investigative subcommittee does 
not adopt a Statement of Alleged Violation, 
it shall transmit to the Committee a report 
containing a summary of the information re-
ceived in the inquiry, its conclusions and 
reasons therefore, and any appropriate rec-
ommendation. 
(h) An investigative subcommittee may 
transmit a single report regarding multiple 
respondents, but shall adopt a separate 
Statement of Alleged Violation for each re-
spondent where applicable. 
RULE 20. AMENDMENTS TO STATEMENTS OF 
ALLEGED VIOLATION 
(a) An investigative subcommittee may, 
upon an affirmative vote of a majority of its 
members, amend its Statement of Alleged 
Violation any time before the Statement of 
Alleged Violation is transmitted to the Com-
mittee; and 
(b) 
If 
an 
investigative 
subcommittee 
amends its Statement of Alleged Violation, 
the respondent shall be notified in writing 
and shall have 30 calendar days from the 
date of that notification to file an answer to 
the amended Statement of Alleged Viola-
tion. 
RULE 21. COMMITTEE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
(a) 
Whenever 
an 
investigative 
sub-
committee does not adopt a Statement of Al-
leged Violation and transmits a report to 
that effect to the Committee, the Committee 
may by an affirmative vote of a majority of 
its members transmit such report to the 
House of Representatives; 
(b) 
Whenever 
an 
investigative 
sub-
committee adopts a Statement of Alleged 
Violation but recommends that no further 
action be taken, it shall transmit a report to 
the Committee regarding the Statement of 
Alleged Violation; and 
(c) 
Whenever 
an 
investigative 
sub-
committee adopts a Statement of Alleged 
Violation, the respondent admits to the vio-
lations set forth in such Statement, the re-
spondent waives the right to an adjudicatory 
hearing, and the respondent’s waiver is ap-
proved by the Committee— 
(1) the subcommittee shall prepare a report 
for transmittal to the Committee, a final 
draft of which shall be provided to the re-
spondent not less than 15 calendar days be-
fore the subcommittee votes on whether to 
adopt the report; 
(2) the respondent may submit views in 
writing regarding the final draft to the sub-
committee within 7 calendar days of receipt 
of that draft; 
(3) the subcommittee shall transmit a re-
port to the Committee regarding the State-
ment of Alleged Violation together with any 
views submitted by the respondent pursuant 
to subparagraph (2), and the Committee shall 
make the report, together with the respond-
ent’s views, available to the public before 
the commencement of any sanction hearing; 
and 
(4) the Committee shall by an affirmative 
vote of a majority of its members issue a re-
port and transmit such report to the House 
of Representatives, together with the re-

views respondent may submit for attach-
ment to the final report; and 
(d) Members of the Committee shall have 
not less than 72 hours to review any report 
transmitted to the Committee by an inves-
tigative subcommittee before both the com-
mencement of a sanction hearing and the 
Committee vote on whether to adopt the re-
port. 
RULE 22. RESPONDENT’S ANSWER 
(a)(1) Within 30 days from the date of 
transmittal of a Statement of Alleged Viola-
tion, the respondent shall file with the inves-
tigative subcommittee an answer, in writing 
and under oath, signed by respondent and re-
spondent’s counsel. Failure to file an answer 
within the time prescribed shall be consid-
ered by the Committee as a denial of each 
count. 
(2) The answer shall contain an admission 
to or denial of each count set forth in the 
Statement of Alleged Violation and may in-
clude negative, affirmative, or alternative 
defenses and any supporting evidence or 
other relevant information. 
(b) The respondent may file a Motion for a 
Bill of Particulars within 10 days of the date 
of transmittal of the Statement of Alleged

quired to file an answer until 20 days after 
the subcommittee has replied to such mo-
tion. 
(c)(1) The respondent may file a Motion to 
Dismiss within 10 days of the date of trans-
mittal of the Statement of Alleged Violation 
or, if a Motion for a Bill of Particulars has 
been filed, within 10 days of the date of the 
subcommittee’s reply to the Motion for a 
Bill of Particulars. If a Motion to Dismiss is 
filed, the respondent shall not be required to 
file an answer until 20 days after the sub-
committee has replied to the Motion to Dis-
miss, unless the respondent previously filed 
a Motion for a Bill of Particulars, in which 
case the respondent shall not be required to 
file an answer until 10 days after the sub-
committee has replied to the Motion to Dis-
miss. The investigative subcommittee shall 
rule upon any motion to dismiss filed during 
the period between the establishment of the 
subcommittee and the subcommittee’s trans-
mittal of a report or Statement of Alleged 
Violation to the Committee or to the Chair 
and Ranking Minority Member at the con-
clusion of an inquiry, and no appeal of the 
subcommittee’s ruling shall lie to the Com-
mittee. 
(2) A Motion to Dismiss may be made on 
the grounds that the Statement of Alleged 
Violation fails to state facts that constitute 
a violation of the Code of Official Conduct or 
other applicable law, rule, regulation, or 
standard of conduct, or on the grounds that 
the Committee lacks jurisdiction to consider 
the allegations contained in the Statement. 
(d) 
Any 
motion 
filed 
with 
the 
sub-
committee pursuant to this rule shall be ac-
companied by a Memorandum of Points and 
Authorities. 
(e)(1) The Chair of the investigative sub-
committee, for good cause shown, may per-
mit the respondent to file an answer or mo-
tion after the day prescribed above. 
(2) If the ability of the respondent to 
present an adequate defense is not adversely 
affected and special circumstances so re-
quire, the Chair of the investigative sub-
committee may direct the respondent to file 
an answer or motion prior to the day pre-
scribed above. 
(f) If the day on which any answer, motion, 
reply, or other pleading must be filed falls on 
a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday, such 
filing shall be made on the first business day 
thereafter. 
(g) As soon as practicable after an answer 
has been filed or the time for such filing has 
expired, the Statement of Alleged Violation 
and any answer, motion, reply, or other 
pleading connected therewith shall be trans-
mitted by the Chair of the investigative sub-
committee to the Chair and Ranking Minor-
ity Member of the Committee. 
RULE 23. ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS 
(a) If a Statement of Alleged Violation is 
transmitted to the Chair and Ranking Mi-
nority Member pursuant to Rule 22, and no 
waiver pursuant to Rule 26(b) has occurred, 
the Chair shall designate the members of the 
Committee who did not serve on the inves-
tigative subcommittee to serve on an adju-
dicatory subcommittee. The Chair and Rank-
ing Minority Member of the Committee shall 
be the Chair and Ranking Minority Member 
of the adjudicatory subcommittee unless 
they 
served 
on 
the 
investigative 
sub-
committee. The respondent shall be notified 
of the designation of the adjudicatory sub-
committee and shall have 10 days after such 
notice is transmitted to object to the par-
ticipation of any subcommittee member. 
Such objection shall be in writing and shall 
be on the grounds that the member cannot 
render an impartial and unbiased decision. 
The members of the Committee shall engage 
in a collegial discussion regarding such ob-
jection. The member against whom the ob-
jection is made shall be the sole judge of any 
disqualification and may choose to seek dis-
qualification from serving on the sub-
committee pursuant to Rule 9(e). 
(b) A majority of the adjudicatory sub-
committee membership plus one must be 
present at all times for the conduct of any 
business pursuant to this rule. 
(c) The adjudicatory subcommittee shall 
hold a hearing to determine whether any 
counts in the Statement of Alleged Violation 
have been proved by clear and convincing 
evidence and shall make findings of fact, ex-
cept where such violations have been admit-
ted by respondent. 
(d) The subcommittee may require, by sub-
poena or otherwise, the attendance and testi-
mony of such witnesses and production of 
such books, records, correspondence, memo-
randa, papers, documents, and other items as 
it deems necessary. A subpoena for docu-
ments may specify terms of return other 
than at a meeting or hearing of the sub-
committee. Depositions, interrogatories, and 
sworn statements taken under any investiga-
tive subcommittee direction may be accept-
ed into the hearing record. 
(e) The procedures set forth in clause 
2(g)(1)–(4), (6)–(7) and (k) of Rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives shall 
apply to adjudicatory hearings. All such 
hearings shall be open to the public unless 
the adjudicatory subcommittee, pursuant to 
such clause, determines that the hearings or 
any part thereof should be closed. 
(f)(1) The adjudicatory subcommittee shall, 
in writing, notify the respondent that the re-
spondent and respondent’s counsel have the 
right to inspect, review, copy, or photograph 
books, papers, documents, photographs, or 
other tangible objects that committee coun-
sel intends to use as evidence against the re-
spondent in an adjudicatory hearing. The re-
spondent shall be given access to such evi-
dence, and shall be provided the names of 
witnesses committee counsel intends to call, 
and a summary of their expected testimony, 
no less than 15 calendar days prior to any 
such hearing. Except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances, no evidence may be introduced 
or witness called in an adjudicatory hearing 
unless the respondent has been afforded a 
prior opportunity to review such evidence or 
has been provided the name of the witness. 
(2) After a witness has testified on direct 
examination at an adjudicatory hearing, the 
Committee, at the request of the respondent,

shall make available to the respondent any 
statement of the witness in the possession of 
the Committee which relates to the subject 
matter as to which the witness has testified. 
(3) Any other testimony, statement, or 
documentary evidence in the possession of 
the Committee which is material to the re-
spondent’s defense shall, upon request, be 
made available to the respondent. 
(g) No less than 5 days prior to the hearing, 
the respondent or counsel shall provide the 
adjudicatory subcommittee with the names 
of witnesses expected to be called, sum-
maries of their expected testimony, and cop-
ies of any documents or other evidence pro-
posed to be introduced. 
(h) The respondent or counsel may apply to 
the subcommittee for the issuance of sub-
poenas for the appearance of witnesses or the 
production of evidence. The application shall 
be granted upon a showing by the respondent 
that the proposed testimony or evidence is 
relevant and not otherwise available to re-
spondent. The application may be denied if 
not made at a reasonable time or if the testi-
mony or evidence would be merely cumu-
lative. 
(i) No later than two weeks or 5 legislative 
days after the Chair of the Committee des-
ignates members to serve on an adjudicatory 
subcommittee, whichever is later, the Chair 
of the adjudicatory subcommittee shall es-
tablish a schedule and procedure for the 
hearing and for prehearing matters. The pro-
cedures may be changed either by the Chair 
of the adjudicatory subcommittee or a by a 
majority vote of the members of the sub-
committee. If the Chair makes prehearing 
rulings upon any question of admissibility or 
relevance of evidence, motion, procedure, or 
any other matter, the Chair shall make 
available those rulings to all subcommittee 
members at the time of the ruling. 
(j) The procedures regarding the admissi-
bility of evidence and rulings shall be as fol-
lows: 
(1) Any relevant evidence shall be admis-
sible unless the evidence is privileged under 
the precedents of the House of Representa-
tives. 
(2) The Chair of the subcommittee or other 
presiding member at an adjudicatory sub-
committee hearing shall rule upon any ques-
tion of admissibility or relevance of evi-
dence, motion, procedure, or any other mat-
ter, and may direct any witness to answer 
any question under penalty of contempt. A 
witness, witness counsel, or a member of the 
subcommittee may appeal any ruling to the 
members present at that proceeding. A ma-
jority vote of the members present at such 
proceeding on such an appeal shall govern 
the question of admissibility and no appeal 
shall lie to the Committee. 
(3) Whenever a witness is deemed by a 
Chair or other presiding member to be in 
contempt of the subcommittee, the matter 
may be referred to the Committee to deter-
mine whether to refer the matter to the 
House of Representatives for consideration. 
(4) Committee counsel may, subject to sub-
committee approval, enter into stipulations 
with the respondent and/or the respondent’s 
counsel as to facts that are not in dispute. 
(k) Unless otherwise provided, the order of 
an adjudicatory hearing shall be as follows: 
(1) The Chair and Ranking Minority Mem-
ber of the subcommittee shall open the hear-
ing with equal time and during which time, 
the Chair shall state the adjudicatory sub-
committee’s authority to conduct the hear-
ing and the purpose of the hearing. 
(2) The Chair shall then recognize Com-
mittee counsel and the respondent’s counsel, 
in turn, for the purpose of giving opening 
statements. 
(3) Testimony from witnesses and other 
relevant evidence shall be received in the fol-
lowing order whenever possible: 
(i) witnesses (deposition transcripts and af-
fidavits obtained during the inquiry may be 
used in lieu of live witnesses) and other evi-
dence offered by Committee counsel, 
(ii) witnesses and other evidence offered by 
the respondent, 
(iii) rebuttal witnesses, as permitted by 
the Chair. 
(4) Witnesses at a hearing shall be exam-
ined first by counsel calling such witness. 
The opposing counsel may then cross-exam-
ine the witness. Redirect examination and 
recross examination by counsel may be per-
mitted 
at 
the 
Chair’s 
discretion. 
Sub-
committee members may then question wit-
nesses. Unless otherwise directed by the 
Chair, questions by Subcommittee members 
shall be conducted under the five-minute 
rule. 
(5) The Chair shall then recognize Com-
mittee counsel and respondent’s counsel, in 
turn, for the purpose of giving closing argu-
ments. Committee counsel may reserve time 
for rebuttal argument, as permitted by the 
Chair. 
(l) A subpoena to a witness to appear at a 
hearing shall be served sufficiently in ad-
vance of that witness’ scheduled appearance 
to allow the witness a reasonable period of 
time, as determined by the Chair of the adju-
dicatory subcommittee, to prepare for the 
hearing and to employ counsel. 
(m) Each witness appearing before the sub-
committee shall be furnished a printed or 
electronic copy of the Committee rules, the 
relevant provisions of the Rules of the House 
of Representatives applicable to the rights of 
witnesses, and a copy of the Statement of Al-
leged Violation. 
(n) Testimony of all witnesses shall be 
taken under oath or affirmation. The form of 
the oath or affirmation shall be: ‘‘Do you 
solemnly swear (or affirm) that the testi-
mony you will give before this subcommittee 
in the matter now under consideration will 
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth (so help you God)?’’ The oath 
or affirmation shall be administered by the 
Chair or Committee member designated by 
the Chair to administer oaths. 
(o) At an adjudicatory hearing, the burden 
of proof rests on Committee counsel to es-
tablish the facts alleged in the Statement of 
Alleged Violation by clear and convincing 
evidence. However, Committee counsel need 
not present any evidence regarding any 
count that is admitted by the respondent or 
any fact stipulated. Committee counsel or 
respondent’s counsel may move the adjudica-
tory subcommittee to make a finding that 
there is no material fact at issue. If the adju-
dicatory subcommittee finds that there is no 
material fact at issue, the burden of proof 
will be deemed satisfied. 
(p) As soon as practicable after all testi-
mony and evidence have been presented, the 
subcommittee shall consider each count con-
tained in the Statement of Alleged Violation 
and shall determine by a majority vote of its 
members whether each count has been 
proved. If a majority of the subcommittee 
does not vote that a count has been proved, 
a motion to reconsider that vote may be 
made only by a member who voted that the 
count was not proved. A count that is not 
proved shall be considered as dismissed by 
the subcommittee. 
(q) The findings of the adjudicatory sub-
committee shall be reported to the Com-
mittee. 
RULE
24. SANCTION
HEARING
AND
CONSIDER-
ATION OF SANCTIONS OR OTHER RECOMMENDA-
TIONS 
(a) If no count in a Statement of Alleged 
Violation is proved, the Committee shall 
prepare a report to the House of Representa-
tives, based upon the report of the adjudica-
tory subcommittee. 
(b) If an adjudicatory subcommittee com-
pletes an adjudicatory hearing pursuant to 
Rule 23 and reports that any count of the 
Statement of Alleged Violation has been 
proved, a hearing before the Committee shall 
be held to receive oral and/or written sub-
missions by counsel for the Committee and 
counsel for the respondent as to the sanction 
the Committee should recommend to the 
House of Representatives with respect to 
such violations. Testimony by witnesses 
shall not be heard except by written request 
and vote of a majority of the Committee. 
(c) Upon completion of any proceeding held 
pursuant to clause (b), the Committee shall 
consider and vote on a motion to recommend 
to the House of Representatives that the 
House take disciplinary action. If a majority 
of the Committee does not vote in favor of 
the recommendation that the House of Rep-
resentatives take action, a motion to recon-
sider that vote may be made only by a mem-
ber who voted against the recommendation. 
The Committee may also, by majority vote, 
adopt a motion to issue a Letter of Reproval 
or take other appropriate Committee action. 
(d) If the Committee determines a Letter 
of Reproval constitutes sufficient action, the 
Committee shall include any such letter as a 
part of its report to the House of Representa-
tives. 
(e) With respect to any proved counts 
against a Member of the House of Represent-
atives, the Committee may recommend to 
the House one or more of the following sanc-
tions: 
(1) Expulsion from the House of Represent-
atives. 
(2) Censure. 
(3) Reprimand. 
(4) Fine. 
(5) Denial or limitation of any right, 
power, privilege, or immunity of the Member 
if under the Constitution the House of Rep-
resentatives may impose such denial or limi-
tation. 
(6) Any other sanction determined by the 
Committee to be appropriate. 
(f) With respect to any proved counts 
against an officer or employee of the House 
of Representatives, the Committee may rec-
ommend to the House one or more of the fol-
lowing sanctions: 
(1) Dismissal from employment. 
(2) Reprimand. 
(3) Fine. 
(4) Any other sanction determined by the 
Committee to be appropriate. 
(g) With respect to the sanctions that the 
Committee may recommend, reprimand is 
appropriate for serious violations, censure is 
appropriate for more serious violations, and 
expulsion of a Member or dismissal of an of-
ficer or employee is appropriate for the most 
serious violations. A recommendation of a 
fine is appropriate in a case in which it is 
likely that the violation was committed to 
secure a personal financial benefit; and a 
recommendation of a denial or limitation of 
a right, power, privilege, or immunity of a 
Member is appropriate when the violation 
bears upon the exercise or holding of such 
right, power, privilege, or immunity. This 
clause sets forth general guidelines and does 
not limit the authority of the Committee to 
recommend other sanctions. 
(h) The Committee report shall contain an 
appropriate statement of the evidence sup-
porting the Committee’s findings and a 
statement of the Committee’s reasons for 
the recommended sanction.

Violation concerning a respondent, it shall 
make such information known and available 
to the respondent as soon as practicable, but 
in no event later than the transmittal of evi-
dence supporting a proposed Statement of 
Alleged Violation pursuant to Rule 26(c). If 
an investigative subcommittee does not 
adopt a Statement of Alleged Violation, it 
shall identify any exculpatory information 
in its possession at the conclusion of its in-
quiry and shall include such information, if 
any, in the subcommittee’s final report to 
the Committee regarding its inquiry. For 
purposes of this rule, exculpatory evidence 
shall be any evidence or information that is 
substantially favorable to the respondent 
with respect to the allegations or charges be-
fore an investigative or adjudicatory sub-
committee. 
RULE 26. RIGHTS OF RESPONDENTS AND 
WITNESSES 
(a) A respondent shall be informed of the 
right to be represented by counsel, to be pro-
vided at the respondent’s own expense. 
(b) A respondent may seek to waive any 
procedural rights or steps in the disciplinary 
process. A request for waiver must be in 
writing, signed by the respondent, and must 
detail what procedural steps the respondent 
seeks to waive. Any such request shall be 
subject to the acceptance of the Committee 
or subcommittee, as appropriate. 
(c) Not less than 10 calendar days before a 
scheduled vote by an investigative sub-
committee on a Statement of Alleged Viola-
tion, the subcommittee shall provide the re-
spondent with a copy of the Statement of Al-
leged Violation it intends to adopt together 
with all evidence it intends to use to prove 
those charges which it intends to adopt, in-
cluding documentary evidence, witness testi-
mony, memoranda of witness interviews, and 
physical evidence, unless the subcommittee 
by an affirmative vote of a majority of its 
members decides to withhold certain evi-
dence in order to protect a witness, but if 
such evidence is withheld, the subcommittee 
shall inform the respondent that evidence is 
being withheld and of the count to which 
such evidence relates. 
(d) Neither the respondent nor respond-
ent’s counsel shall, directly or indirectly, 
contact the subcommittee or any member 
thereof during the period of time set forth in 
paragraph (c) except for the sole purpose of 
settlement discussions where counsels for 
the respondent and the subcommittee are 
present. 
(e) If, at any time after the issuance of a 
Statement of Alleged Violation, the Com-
mittee or any subcommittee thereof deter-
mines that it intends to use evidence not 
provided to a respondent under paragraph (c) 
to prove the charges contained in the State-
ment of Alleged Violation (or any amend-
ment thereof), such evidence shall be made 
immediately available to the respondent, 
and it may be used in any further proceeding 
under the Committee’s rules. 
(f) Evidence provided pursuant to para-
graph (c) or (e) shall be made available to 
the respondent and respondent’s counsel 
only after each agrees, in writing, that no 
document, information, or other materials 
obtained pursuant to that paragraph shall be 
made public until— 
(1) such time as a Statement of Alleged 
Violation is made public by the Committee if 
the respondent has waived the adjudicatory 
hearing; or 
(2) the commencement of an adjudicatory 
hearing if the respondent has not waived an 
adjudicatory hearing; but the failure of re-
spondent and respondent’s counsel to so 
agree in writing, and therefore not receive 
the evidence, shall not preclude the issuance 
of a Statement of Alleged Violation at the 
end of the period referenced to in (c). 
(g) If the Committee issues a report with 
respect to a claim referred to the Committee 
by the Office of Congressional Workplace 
Rights pursuant to Section 416(e) of the Con-
gressional Accountability Act of 1995, the 
Committee shall ensure that the report does 
not directly disclose the identity or position 
of the individual who filed the claim. 
(h) A respondent shall receive written no-
tice whenever— 
(1) the Chair and Ranking Minority Mem-
ber determine that information the Com-
mittee has received constitutes a complaint; 
(2) a complaint or allegation is trans-
mitted to an investigative subcommittee; 
(3) that subcommittee votes to authorize 
its first subpoena or to take testimony under 
oath, whichever occurs first; 
(4) the Committee votes to expand the 
scope of the inquiry of an investigative sub-
committee; and 
(5) the Committee or an investigative sub-
committee determines to take into evidence 
the trial transcript or exhibits admitted into 
evidence at a criminal trial pursuant to Rule 
18(e)(3). 
(i) 
Whenever 
an 
investigative 
sub-
committee adopts a Statement of Alleged 
Violation and a respondent enters into an 
agreement with that subcommittee to settle 
an investigation, in whole or in part, on 
which the Statement is based, that agree-
ment, unless the respondent requests other-
wise, shall be in writing and signed by the 
respondent and the respondent’s counsel, the 
Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the 
subcommittee, and outside counsel, if any. 
(j) Statements or information derived sole-
ly from a respondent or respondent’s counsel 
during any settlement discussions between 
the Committee or a subcommittee thereof 
and the respondent shall not be included in 
any report of the subcommittee or the Com-
mittee or otherwise publicly disclosed with-
out the consent of the respondent. 
(k) Whenever a motion to establish an in-
vestigative subcommittee does not prevail, 
the Committee shall promptly send a letter 
to the respondent(s) informing the respond-
ent(s) of such vote. 
(l) Witnesses shall be afforded a reasonable 
period of time, as determined by the Com-
mittee or subcommittee, to prepare for an 
appearance before an investigative sub-
committee or for an adjudicatory hearing 
and to obtain counsel. 
(m) Prior to their testimony, witnesses 
shall be furnished a printed or electronic 
copy of the Committee’s Rules and the provi-
sions of the Rules of the House of Represent-
atives applicable to the rights of witnesses. 
(n) Witnesses may be accompanied by their 
own counsel for the purpose of advising them 
concerning their constitutional rights. The 
Chair may punish breaches of order and de-
corum, and of professional responsibility on 
the part of counsel, by censure and exclusion 
from the hearings; and the Committee may 
cite the offender to the House of Representa-
tives for contempt. 
(o) Each witness subpoenaed to provide tes-
timony or other evidence shall be provided 
the same per diem rate as established, au-
thorized, and regulated by the Committee on 
House Administration for Members, officers, 
and employees of the House, and, as the 
Chair considers appropriate, actual expenses 
of travel to or from the place of examina-
tion. No compensation shall be authorized 
for attorney’s fees or for a witness’ lost earn-
ings. Such per diem may not be paid if a wit-
ness had been summoned at the place of ex-
amination. 
(p) With the approval of the Committee, a 
witness, upon request, may be provided with 
a transcript of the witness’ own deposition 
or other testimony taken in executive ses-
sion, or, with the approval of the Chair and 
Ranking Minority Member, may be per-
mitted to examine such transcript in the of-
fice of the Committee. Any such request 
shall be in writing and shall include a state-
ment that the witness, and counsel, agree to 
maintain the confidentiality of all executive 
session proceedings covered by such tran-
script. 
RULE 27. FRIVOLOUS FILINGS 
If a complaint or information offered as a 
complaint is deemed frivolous by an affirma-
tive vote of a majority of the members of the 
Committee, the Committee may take such 
action as it, by an affirmative vote of a ma-
jority 
deems 
appropriate 
in 
the 
cir-
cumstances. 
RULE 28. REFERRALS TO FEDERAL OR STATE 
AUTHORITIES 
Referrals made under clause 3(a)(3) of Rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives may be made by an affirmative vote of 
two-thirds of the members of the Committee.

E207 
March 8, 2021 
IN HONOR OF DR. ANDREW 
BROOKS 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with Congressman SOTO, to 
honor the life of Dr. Andrew Ira Brooks, a hero 
of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Brooks, a 
longtime Research Professor at Rutgers Uni-
versity in New Jersey, passed away on Janu-
ary 23, 2021 after a vibrant life filled with nu-
merous professional and personal accomplish-
ments. 
Dr. Brooks led the effort to develop the Rut-
gers COVID–19 diagnostic assay in early 
2020. This COVID–19 rapid test received FDA 
Emergency Use Authorization in March 2020 
as the first approved saliva diagnostic and 
was the first test approved for home use. It is 
particularly important because this low-contact 
collection method helps protect our frontline 
medical workers. To date, there have been 
over four million clinical tests, undoubtedly 
saving the lives of many around our country 
and providing a practical tool for pandemic 
control. 
Born and raised in New Jersey, Dr. Brooks 
went on to receive his Ph.D. degree in Neuro-
science from the University of Rochester and 
became their Director of Medical Center Core 
Facilities. Four years later, he returned to his 
home state to direct the joint Rutgers/UMDNJ 
EOHSI Bionomics Research and Technology 
Center with an appointment as Research Pro-
fessor in the Rutgers University Department of 
Genetics. 
In 2009, Dr. Brooks became Chief Oper-
ating Officer and Director of Technology De-
velopment of RUCDR, Infinite Biologics, a Rut-
gers public/private partnership. He also served 
17 years as an advisor to the Food and Drug 
Administration, as Director of the Harlan 
GeneScreen Laboratory and as Co-Founding 
Director of the BioProcessing Solutions Alli-
ance. In June 2020, Dr. Brooks founded Infin-
ity BiologiX and became its Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Brooks 
also made significant academic contributions 
to the improvement of human health and the 
field of biomedicine which can be seen in the 
70 publications he coauthored, several with 
over 1000 citations in the literature. 
Dr. Brooks loved golf, playing the sport 
throughout his life. He was an extraordinarily 
accomplished amateur, winning international 
tournaments with his skill, concentration, and 
friendly competitive spirit. He is survived by 
his mother, Mrs. Phyllis Brooks, his sister, 
Janet Green, his children Lauren, Hannah and 
Danielle, and his loving wife, Jil Brooks, as 
well as many dear friends and colleagues. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my 
colleagues will join me in honoring Dr. Andrew 
Brooks for his dedication to the medical field 
and the countless lives he saved by leading 
the effort to develop the Rutgers COVID–19 
saliva test. 
IN MEMORY OF REVEREND 
BRYANT WARDELL RAINES 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay homage to an 
outstanding man of God, dedicated public 
servant, courageous soldier, and friend of 
longstanding, 
Reverend 
Bryant 
Wardell 
Raines. Reverend Raines transitioned from 
labor to reward on Wednesday, February 24, 
2021. His homegoing service was held on Sat-
urday, March 6, 2021, at 11 a.m. at the Macon 
City Auditorium in Macon, Georgia. He leaves 
behind a loving family, his dedicated church 
congregation at the New Pilgrim Missionary 
Baptist Church (NPMBC), and an appreciative 
community for his extraordinary life of service 
to God and humankind. 
A native son of Macon, Reverend Bryant 
Wardell Raines was born on February 3, 
1977, to the union of Mrs. Barbara Tharpe 
Raines and the late Reverend Curtis Raines, 
Sr. He thirsted for knowledge and self-im-
provement. He was a 1995 graduate of Cen-
tral High School and a 1999 graduate of Clark 
Atlanta University, where he received B.A. De-
grees in English, Philosophy, and Religion. In 
addition to attending Georgia Southern Univer-
sity (in pursuit of an M.A. Degree in Public Ad-
ministration) and The Morehouse School of 
Religion at the Interdenominational Theo-
logical Center, he was also a 2001 graduate 
of the United States Army Chaplain Center 
and School. He was pursuing an M.A. Degree 
in Evangelism and Church Planting at Liberty 
University when the Lord called him home. 
Reverend Raines served his country honor-
ably in the United States Army as the Chap-
lain Assistant for the Installation Garrison 
Command, 3rd Infantry Division and the 4th 
Battalion 64th Armor Regiment of Fort Stew-
art, Georgia. He received awards for his val-
iant service including Army Service Ribbon 
(2001); Army Commendation Medal (2001, 
2002, 2003, and 2004); National Defense 
Service Ribbon (2001); Primary Leadership 
Development Ribbon (2003); Presidential Unit 
Citation (2003); and Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal (2003). 
Reverend Raines was a man of God, truly 
devoted to his calling—a calling from God, 
passed to him through his father, Reverend 
Curtis Raines, Sr., who was his predecessor 
at NPMBC and the past president of the Gen-
eral Missionary Baptist Convention of Georgia. 
As the beloved Pastors of NPMBC, they uti-
lized their roles as spiritual leaders to fully en-
gage with their community by creating numer-
ous outreach programs and opportunities to 
enrich the lives of those around them. Before 
his transition, Reverend Bryant Raines worked 
tirelessly with The Curtis Raines, Sr. Founda-
tion on the development of The Curtis Raines, 
Sr. Health and Wellness Facility. This holistic 
community center seeks to minister to the total 
person by providing programs and resources 
to 
promote 
both 
physical 
and 
spiritual 
wellness. 
Reverend Raines believed strongly that in-
volvement in his local and state-level sacer-
dotal communities was an integral part of his 
calling as a Minister of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Accordingly, he served in numerous 
roles that had as their purpose the uplift of hu-
mankind. In addition to being the beloved Pas-
tor of NPMBC, he served the Deacon, the 
Audio and Video, and the Evangelism Min-
istries at NPMBC; President of the Sixth Dis-
trict of the General Missionary Baptist Conven-
tion of Georgia, Inc.; Vice President of the 
Sixth District of the General Missionary Baptist 
Convention of Georgia, Inc.; Member of the 
Board of Trustees at Wesley Glen Ministries; 
Member of the Rotary Club of Macon, Geor-
gia; Member of the Baptist Minister’s Union of 
Macon and Vicinity; and as Founder of the 
Heal the Hood Initiative, a community initiative 
to combat violence and address the needs of 
the total community. 
Mother Teresa once said that ‘‘At the end of 
life we will not be judged by how many diplo-
mas we have received, how much money we 
have made, how many great things we have 
done. We will be judged by ‘‘I was hungry, 
and you gave me something to eat, I was 
naked and you clothed me. I was homeless, 
and you took me in.’’ Reverend Bryant Wardell 
Raines, in his life, did just that, and the world 
is better because he passed this way. On a 
personal note, the advice, counsel, friendship, 
and support that I have received from Rev-
erend Raines as Congressman for the Second 
Congressional District has been immeas-
urable. He never told me what I wanted to 
hear, but he always told me what he felt I 
needed to hear. And, for that, I will be forever 
grateful. 
Reverend Raines accomplished much in his 
life, but none of it would have been possible 
without the Grace of God and the love and 
support of his family including his wife, Mrs. 
Ilashia Brezial Raines; and his siblings, Shun, 
Curtis, Jr., and Varina. He loved his family. 
His family loved him back. And they will miss 
him along with all of us whose lives he 
touched. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join my wife, 
Vivian, and me, along with countless others 
throughout Georgia and the nation in saluting 
Reverend Bryant Wardell Raines for his serv-
ice in the ministry, to his country, and to hu-
mankind; and in extending our deepest condo-
lences to Reverend Raines’ family, friends, 
loved ones, and all those who mourn his loss. 
We pray that they will be consoled and com-
forted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit 
in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

HONORING ROSE CORDASCO’S 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Rose Cordasco’s 100th 
birthday. Rose is a loving, kind mother, sister, 
grandmother and great-grandmother. She is 
beloved by her family and from how her family 
has described her, it is clear that she has 
made the most of each of her one-hundred 
years. 
I wish her the best on achieving this mile-
stone.

HONORING JOSEPHINE MORSE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to recognize the ex-
traordinary service of Josephine Morse, who 
served in the House Office of General Coun-
sel as a Deputy General Counsel. During her 
tenure, Ms. Morse, a District of Columbia resi-
dent, played an integral role in safeguarding 
the legal interests of the House and its Mem-
bers, Officers, and employees in federal court 
litigation involving issues of the highest institu-
tional importance. 
Ms. Morse provided invaluable legal counsel 
and representation to numerous House com-
mittees, greatly assisting them both in fulfilling 
their constitutionally authorized oversight func-
tions and defending those prerogatives in liti-
gation. Ms. Morse provided vital legal counsel 
to the House in both impeachments of Presi-
dent Trump and in defense of longstanding in-
stitutional prerogatives. Those prerogatives in-
cluded the House’s constitutional authority 
under the Appropriations Clause and the 
power of House committees to issue sub-
poenas for both documents and testimony 
from the White House and Executive Branch 
agencies. 
Of particular importance to the District of 
Columbia, Ms. Morse’s legal work in litigation 
involving the District’s quest to obtain the fun-
damental right of voting representation in Con-
gress was exceptional, and her oral advocacy 
on behalf of the House’s position in support of 
voting representation for the District before a 
three-judge district court was highly effective. 
Ms. Morse’s work on behalf of the House 
was of the highest caliber, and I have no 
doubt that the Office of Management and 
Budget, which she recently joined, will benefit 
from her outstanding legal counsel. On behalf 
of the entire House community, I thank Ms. 
Morse for her dedicated service to the House, 
and I wish her the very best in all of her future 
endeavors. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES 
WALKER PREWITT SR. 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to observe and mourn the passing of a 
talented scientist, college professor, and most 
notably a ‘‘citizen of the world’’ who passion-
ately advocated for world peace and justice, 
Mr. Charlie Prewitt, of Mansfield Hollow, Con-
necticut. My friend Charlie passed at the ex-
traordinary age of 102 on January 7, 2021, 
sadly due to complications related to the 
coronavirus. 
My statement today could not begin to en-
capsulate all that Charlie had accomplished 
during his industrious life. Born in Indiana in 
1918, he showed such academic aptitude from 
an early age when he entered the second 
grade by age five. A prolific musician, playing 
both piano and violin, he received a scholar-
ship to play in the Transylvania University or-
chestra where he would then go onto earn a 
bachelor’s degree in chemistry. Charlie also 
met the love of his life, Virginia Stewart, at his 
alma mater—a love that would last 65 years. 
Charlie went on to continue his education at 
Louisiana State University when his graduate 
work was interrupted by World War II. Due to 
his background in chemistry, he was con-
scripted to work at Dupont Chemical on ex-
tending the burn rate of gunpowder. That work 
led him to the Manhattan Project where he 
collected samples from reactors and ran titra-
tions on plutonium. His involvement in the cre-
ation of nuclear weapons and intimate knowl-
edge of their terrifying power was a driving 
motivation for his determined commitment to 
nuclear nonproliferation. 
When the war ended, Charlie completed his 
graduate work, obtaining a Master’s in Edu-
cation at University of Kentucky, followed by a 
Doctorate in Science Education at Columbia 
University. In 1952, he and Virginia finally 
landed in Willimantic, Connecticut when he 
moved to take a professorship at the then 
named Willimantic State Teachers College, 
now Eastern Connecticut State University. His 
commitment to his students and his passion 
for educating educators was unmatched. His 
leadership led to the establishment of a minor 
degree in Peace and Human Rights at the 
University and the development of a scholar-
ship program for students pursuing this de-
gree. 
While he remained in Connecticut for the 
rest of his life and career, Charlie never lost 
sight of foreign affairs. He accepted a Ful-
bright Scholarship to Myanmar, a U.S. AID po-
sition in Afghanistan and finally joined a Ford 
Foundation project in Pakistan. His commit-
ment to war resistance, social justice, peace, 
and advancement of human rights never 
wavered. 
Charlie and I crossed paths many times dur-
ing my time in public service, and while we 
would engage in healthy debate, our con-
versations always left me with a deeper under-
standing of the issues and an even deeper re-
spect for his commitment to them. Charlie’s 
loss leaves a deep void in the activist commu-
nity in Eastern Connecticut and around the 
world. He now goes on to join his loving wife 
Virginia, who regretfully predeceased him in 
2007. Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues and this Chamber to join me in ex-
pressing our deepest respect for Charlie’s 
work and life and send our deepest condo-
lences to the Prewitt Family. Charlie is sur-
vived by his children Charlies Walker Jr., 
(John) David Prewitt and Mary Stewart Prewitt 
and their families who carry the indelible mem-
ory of Charlie and Virginia in their hearts so 
that their example of compassion and kind-
ness will carry on.

GAYLE 
GRIFFIN, 
AFGE’S DISTRICT 7 WOMAN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to pay tribute to the career and ongo-
ing legacy of Gayle Griffin, a retired nurse for-
merly employed at Milwaukee’s Clement J. 
Zablocki VA Medical Center and President of 
the American Federation of Government Em-
ployees (AFGE) Local 3. She is an exemplary 
voice in our community and has consistently 
used her position to defend others. I want to 
congratulate her on her recent selection as 
AFGE’s District 7 Woman of the Year. 
Gayle is the first African American to ever 
be elected president of her Local AFGE 
branch. During her time in AFGE leadership, 
she has continually used her position to advo-
cate for her members against anti-union exec-
utive orders, racism, and other inequities as a 
fierce champion for social justice. 
Throughout her eleven-year career as a 
nurse serving our veterans at the Milwaukee 
VA, Gayle was one of many Black nurses who 
endured racism in her workplace. However, 
rather than backing down, she resolutely 
sought to protect and defend the rights of 
workers at the Local AFGE branch. She has 
spoken out about the tremendous struggles 
that VA nursing staff are facing amidst the 
COVID–19 pandemic and has repeatedly 
called for more honest communication from 
the Department of Veterans Affairs with its 
employees. 
On February 21, 2021, Gayle was selected 
as AFGE’s District 7 Woman of the Year. This 
important award is granted to those who ex-
hibit selfless dedication to union solidarity, 
public service, and workplace health and safe-
ty. This is an honor that Gayle has truly 
earned. She has fought tirelessly to protect 
the health of veterans, for workers’ rights, and 
for commonsense workplace safety and eq-
uity—especially during the devastation of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Her altruistic spirit and inspiring dedication 
to her colleagues and community are why 
Gayle is so deserving of the title of AFGE’s 
District 7 Woman of the Year. Wisconsin’s 4th 
Congressional District, and the veterans who 
depend on the VA for their health care, have 
been made better as a result of Gayle’s phe-
nomenal work. I sincerely respect her deter-
mination and applaud her accomplishments. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor my con-
stituent and her recent accomplishment and 
celebrate the great work that she and others 
in AFGE District 7 are doing in service to our 
veterans, our country and the state of Wis-
consin.

Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam Speaker, by

HONORING THE LIFE OF HECTOR 
F. ELIZALDE 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a true champion for veterans, 
a dear friend, a wonderful employee and col-
league, a proud resident of the City of Mon-
rovia, and a dedicated, caring gentleman in 
Hector Elizalde, our beloved Deputy District 
Director of the 32nd District, who died on Feb-
ruary 7, 2021, from complications due to 
COVID–19. For the past 11 years, Hector was 
truly devoted to his job of defending, advo-
cating for, and serving veterans and their fami-
lies, and tackling any problem that came his 
way. He was the embodiment of what it 
means to serve one’s nation and one’s com-
munity, holding true to his pledge to never 
leave a soldier behind, whether on the battle-
field or city street. 
Hector F. Elizalde was born in Chicago, IL 
on February 15, 1946. He served in the United 
States Army from July 31, 1964, until he was 
honorably discharged on July 28, 1967. Hector 
later graduated from California State Univer-
sity, Los Angeles with a Bachelor of Arts de-
gree in Political Science. He worked for some 
of America’s most recognized companies, 
such as Anheuser-Busch, Stroh Brewery Com-
pany, PepsiCo, and Don King Productions. His 
career advancements led the Elizalde family to 
live throughout the country, from 1984, in the 
states of Michigan, Connecticut, New York, 
and Florida until his return to California in 
1997. Hector could have continued excelling in 
lucrative professions, but he had a great 
sense of duty to any and all fellow veterans, 
and also to his neighbors. 
From the very first day he entered our office 
in the spring of 2010 until his very last on this 
earth, Hector honorably served the veteran 
community. Whether it was helping a home-
less veteran find shelter or escorting the cas-
ket of a fallen servicemember at the airport, 
Hector’s compassion for helping veterans 
touched countless lives. Giving out his per-
sonal cell phone number was nothing out of 
the ordinary, and whenever he did so, he 
made sure everyone knew that it was a 24/7 
number. 
Hector understood the frustration many vet-
erans felt because of delays in VA benefits 
and routine health checkups that would take 
an entire day. He took this personally and 
vowed we must do better. Under his tenure as 
Military/Veterans Liaison, we began to hold an 
annual Veterans Forum, to bring the VA to the 
San Gabriel Valley, which grew in size and 
reach each successive year. As a result of 
Hector’s persistence and laser-focus on the 
mission, the San Gabriel Valley VA Health 
Clinic was opened in May 2019 in Arcadia, 
CA. 
A sharp dresser, but very humble individual, 
he never sought nor wanted praise. He was 
there for everybody. He served not only the 
people of the 32nd District, but all of Los An-
geles County, as Chair of the Los Angeles 
County Veterans Advisory Commission, to 
which he was appointed by LA County Super-
visor Kathryn Barger. 
Since his passing, the outpouring from peo-
ple whose lives he touched has been immeas-
urable, because he was a true believer in pub-
lic service. From the many hours he spent re-
solving constituents’ casework, to the city 
council meetings, weekend veteran and com-
munity events he would attend; for Hector, the 
public’s needs always came first. 
Hector is survived by his ex-wife, Elaine, the 
mother of his two adult children; sons Phillip 
and Edward; Edward’s wife Ingrid; and their 
two children, Isabella and Aiden. Hector truly 
loved and was proud of his family, especially 
his grandchildren. 
Hector made us all feel like family. He was 
kind, respectful, thoughtful, and helpful to ev-
eryone he met. His charisma and smile will 
never be forgotten. His laughter and the way 
he cared for others will forever live on in our 
memories. It was our honor to be able to work 
alongside him. 
The world has lost a hero. Hector was the 
best of the best, and we are all better people 
because of him. There is no one else like him 
and probably never will be, but it is safe to 
say, our world needs more Hectors.

IN MEMORY OF LAURA COLE 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember an extraordinary 
Maine woman, Laura Cole. 
Laura lived her life purposefully, offering 
help and engendering hope and happiness as 
a partner, parent, volunteer, friend, business 
owner, and citizen of Maine. She understood 
the power of one person’s voice and helping 
hand, and her spirit was contagious. 
Laura exemplified the words of Edward 
Hale, ‘‘I am only one, but still I am one. I can-
not do everything, but still I can do something; 
and because I cannot do everything, I will not 
refuse to do something that I can do.’’ 
It seems there was very little that Laura did 
not do, and she received several awards for 
her efforts, including the Presidential Volunteer 
Service Award in 2012, the Responder of the 
Year Award in 2013, and the New Maine Busi-
ness of the Year for York County, Maine, in 
2019. She spearheaded her community’s Op-
eration Santa program for kids and the annual 
Lebanon Community Festival. In the midst of 
this winter that has been darkened by a pan-
demic, she created two acres of holiday lights 
for the community to enjoy from their cars and 
drop off canned food to donate to local food 
pantries. And she used proceeds from her 
event photography business to support End 68 
Hours of Hunger and buy lunches to support 
local restaurants and donate to first respond-
ers. 
Not only did Laura devote her life to acts of 
kindness and caring, her final gifts were organ 
and tissue donations, providing lifesaving help 
and health to over a dozen people. In her 
honor, the family has established Laura’s Leg-
acy of Love as a living memorial project with 
a simple mission—to promote kindness by 
paying it forward in her name. 
I am proud to have represented Laura Cole 
in the U.S. Congress—an indefatigable young 
woman who loved Maine and set an extraor-
dinary example for us all.

100TH BIRTHDAY OF EMMIE 
‘BOOTS’ BURK 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, it 
is with great honor that I rise today in celebra-
tion of Mrs. Emmie ‘Boots’ Burk to commemo-
rate the very significant milestone of her 100th 
birthday. 
Emmie Fulton Burk was born on Texas 
Independence Day, March 2, 1921 in Koblenz, 
Germany to an American military family sta-
tioned overseas. Growing up in the State of 
Georgia she learned the importance of family 
and tradition. She was a member of the first 
Girl Scout troop on Ft. Screven, Georgia 
(Tybee Island). When her father, MSgt. Ben-
jamin Fulton was later stationed at Ft. Sam 
Houston, San Antonio, Emmie moved to finish 
high school in 1939. She has been a proud 
Texan ever since. 
In 1942, she married the love of her life, 
James William Burk. She helped raise their 
son and daughter and became very active in 
their children’s school and extracurricular ac-
tivities, as well as church and other community 
service. She was independent and career driv-
en. After the passing of her husband in 1979, 
she worked to solely support herself eventu-
ally going on to work in the early stages of 
market research. After several years in the in-
dustry, she began her own company, Burk 
Market Research, growing it into a successful 
venture through the 1970s to 1990s. 
A faithful public servant, she worked with 
the United States Census Bureau assisting 
with many monthly studies, to include current 
population studies. This led her to travel 
across our great country to many different 
areas, where she helped lead the count. In 
1991, she received the Bronze Medal for meri-
torious service. Mrs. Burk retired in 2011 at 
the age of 90 with 43 years of service, making 
her one of the longest serving members in the 
Bureau’s history. 
Today you will find Mrs. Burk attending one 
of her great grandchildren’s events. A strong 
family-driven mind, Mrs. Burk dedicates her 
time to family and making new joyful memo-
ries. Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor 
Mrs. Burk and a tremendous life well-lived. I 
thank Mrs. Burk for her many years of public 
service. It is my hope that she will share her 
100th with all her loved ones.

SUMGAIT, KIROVABAD, AND BAKU 
MASSACRES 
HON. BRAD SHERMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I stand in 
solidarity with the Armenian American commu-
nity in commemorating the pogroms against 
Armenians in the cities of Sumgait (February 
27–29, 1988), Kirovabad (November 21–27, 
1988) and Baku (January 13–19, 1990). 
Thirty-three years ago, in the Azerbaijani 
town of Sumgait, peaceful Armenian residents 
were brutally targeted on the basis of their 
ethnicity and subjected to unspeakable crimes. 
The New York Times reported Armenians 
being ‘‘hunted’’ down and an account of a 
pregnant Armenian woman, who had been 
disemboweled. The U.S. Senate passed an 
amendment in July of 1989, noting that even 
the Soviet government had termed the murder 
of Armenians in Sumgait a ‘‘pogrom.’’ 
The Sumgait Pogroms were the beginning 
of an escalation of violence against the Arme-
nian minority, with a wave of anti-Armenian vi-
olence spreading to Kirovabad in November 
1988 and to Baku in January 1990, which cul-
minated in the forcible expulsion of 390,000 
Armenians from Azerbaijan and the 1991–94 
war over Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh). 
In response to the Sumgait and Kirovabad 
pogroms, over 100 leading academics and 
human rights advocates, including the Execu-
tive Director of the NAACP and Elie Wiesel, 
placed an advertisement in The New York 
Times titled: ‘‘An Open Letter to International 
Public Opinion on Anti-Armenian Pogroms in 
the Soviet Union.’’ The letter appealed to the 
international community to condemn the atroc-
ities and prevent further violence by stating: 
‘‘The international community of states . . . 
must prove the authenticity of its commitment 
to human rights in order to ensure that, due to 
indifference and silence bordering on com-
plicity, another genocide does not occur.’’ 
(July 27, 1990, The New York Times) 
Unfortunately, Azeri attacks against Arme-
nian civilians have only continued. In its latest 
bout of aggression against Armenia and 
Artsakh in the fall of 2020, Azerbaijan carried 
out indiscriminate attacks against civilians. A 
report by Human Rights Watch found that 
Azeri forces used inherently indiscriminate 
cluster munitions and artillery rockets or other 
weapons that did not distinguish between mili-
tary targets and civilian objects. Multiple 
strikes hit residential homes in less than a 
minute, suggesting bombardment of civilian 
areas. 
Today, Armenians are still held captive in 
Azerbaijan, with no planned date to be re-
turned to Armenia. Armenian prisoners of war 
have been subjected to physical beatings and 
other inhumane treatment at the hand of Azer-
baijan. The government of Azerbaijan must be 
held accountable by the international commu-
nity, and I will continue to work in Congress to 
shed light on and learn the lessons of such 
past and present atrocities. 
REMEMBERING BOB SMITTCAMP 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of a San Joaquin Valley leg-
end, Robert Smittcamp, who passed away on 
March 4, 2021, at the age of 79. I am deeply 
saddened by Bob’s passing. 
Bob was a one-man Valley institution. A 
businessman, philanthropist, and community 
activist, he headed both Lyons Magnus food 
company and Wawona Packing. He had a 
particular passion for expanding healthcare 
access and improving education, donating mil-
lions of dollars to enhance both sectors 
throughout the Valley. 
I’m lucky to have had Bob as a close friend 
and mentor. I was among countless Valley 
residents who frequently turned to him for ad-
vice on Valley issues. His assistance was in-
valuable on critical issues such as the Valley 
water crisis and the 2008 recession. 
Bob and I also spent many hours discussing 
how 
to 
bring 
high-quality, 
affordable 
healthcare to every Valley family. I valued his 
insights on that question because he devel-
oped innovative ways to provide healthcare for 
his employees, who he always viewed as part 
of his own family. I’m convinced Bob’s ap-
proach provides a model for drastically im-
proving healthcare for the entire country. 
Bob epitomized all the virtues of the San 
Joaquin Valley. He was always available to 
help those of us who sought his guidance. But 
if you were looking for someone to sugarcoat 
a tough situation, then Bob was not your best 
option. He was an honest straight-shooter 
who’d give you candid answers whether you 
wanted them or not. That’s why I always con-
sulted him when I had especially tough prob-
lems that needed realistic solutions. 
Bob’s love for the Valley ran deep, and the 
region is richer in countless ways thanks to his 
contributions. He created jobs, ran companies 
that fed millions of people, shared his wisdom 
and experience with anyone who asked, gen-
erously funded deserving community institu-
tions, and raised an exceptional family. 
Bob was simply irreplaceable. He’ll be deep-
ly missed, but he leaves behind an incredible 
legacy 
of 
hard 
work, 
success, 
and 
unconcealed passion for the Valley and its 
people. I offer my deepest condolences to his 
wife Annette, his children Brent, Lisa, and 
Brandon, and the rest of his family.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 2, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 1 on account of several 
major issues with the bill. First, this bill did not 
go through committees and proper delibera-
tions. Second, this bill takes drastic steps to 
federalize our elections and infringe on States’ 
rights. Third, this bill increases opportunities 
for fraud without proper guardrails or internal 
controls. To mitigate some fraud risks, I pro-
posed an amendment dealing with election au-
dits, which was rejected by Democrats on the 
House Rules Committee.

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MEM-
BERSHIP 
ON 
CAPITOL 
POLICE 
BOARD ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Membership 
on Capitol Police Board Act, which would 
make the chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police 
Department (MPD) an ex officio, non-voting 
member of the Capitol Police Board (Board). 
The Board oversees the U.S. Capitol Police 
(USCP) and security for the U.S. Capitol com-
plex and is comprised of three voting mem-
bers (the House Sergeant at Arms, the Senate 
Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper and the Ar-
chitect of the Capitol) and one ex officio, non- 
voting member (the USCP chief). My bill 
would give the MPD chief the same status on 
the Board as the USCP chief. 
The events and aftermath of the attack on 
the Capitol on January 6, 2021, demonstrate 
the need for D.C. membership on the Board. 
Not only would the MPD chief’s membership 
on the Board help improve coordination be-
tween USCP and MPD, which helped save the 
Capitol and its occupants after USCP was 
overrun during the attack, it would force the 
Board to consider the interests of D.C. resi-
dents in its decision-making. The Board’s deci-
sions affect D.C. residents more than any 
other Americans, but no member of the Board 
has any obligation to consider the perspective 
and needs of D.C. residents. D.C. residents 
continue to bear the brunt of the security deci-
sions the Board has made since the attack. 
For example, the fencing around the Capitol 
complex has forced D.C. emergency vehicles 
and residents to take detours and has pre-
vented access to the Capitol grounds, which 
are used by neighborhood residents for recre-
ation and relaxation. 
I support the calls to evaluate whether the 
Board is the right mechanism to oversee secu-
rity at the Capitol, but as long as the Board is 
in existence, D.C. should have membership on 
it. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BOB 
EGOLF 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of Mr. Bob Egolf of 
Churubusco, Indiana. 
For 65 years, Egolf worked in the grocery 
business. He started his career at John 
Shelton’s IGA, located on North Main Street in 
Churubusco in 1956 when he was 14 years 
old. Seven years later, he purchased the gro-
cery from Shelton in 1967, and in 1982 built 
a new store south of Churubusco on US 33. 
Egolf’s IGA is known throughout the area for 
its freshly cut meats and daily baked bakery

items. Egolf opened the store early and closed 
late, operating from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven 
days a week. He made it a point to talk with 
his customers and would take special orders 
of items that people wanted. 
Egolf was one of the longest continuous 
business owners in Churubusco’s history. In 
addition to running his business, he frequently 
gave his time and money to local causes. But 
for Egolf’s partnership with the Churubusco 
News, the newspaper would not exist today. 
He also contributed to the community through 
various organizations, such as with the 
Churubusco 
Area 
Jaycees, 
Churubusco 
Chamber of Commerce and as a longtime 
Smith Township trustee. 
The story of Mr. Egolf is one that is uniquely 
American: defined by hard work, sacrifice, and 
service to others. Though Bob is no longer 
with us, his spirit of good will and generosity 
to those in Churubusco and beyond endures.

RECOGNIZING REVEREND FLOYD 
L. WHITE, III 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Reverend Floyd L. White, 
III on his retirement. During his over twenty 
years of service, Reverend White has been a 
stalwart of the community, always putting oth-
er’s needs before his own. 
Since 1988, in his private capacity, Rev-
erend White has served as a Pastor for the 
Woodland Avenue Presbyterian Church, pro-
viding spiritual leadership to church members. 
In his public capacity, since 1988, Reverend 
White has served America’s servicemen and 
woman. Beginning as Battalion Chaplain, Rev-
erend White administered to the spiritual and 
moral needs of approximately 150 soldiers 
and their families. Eventually, from 2012 to 
2019, Reverend White served as the Director 
of Camden County Veteran Affairs where he 
worked to better the lives of veterans and their 
families. After twenty years of service, Rev-
erend Floyd L. White, III more than deserves 
a peaceful retirement and I wish him the best. 
I commend Reverend Floyd L. White, III for 
his dedication to serving the people of New 
Jersey and I know the Woodland Avenue 
Presbyterian Church will be sad to see him 
go.

HONORING DELWYN SHOWALTER 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Delwyn Showalter, a long-time coach, 
athletic director, and mentor to many students 
in Mount Ayr, Iowa. Delwyn is set to retire 
from his roles this year, and I wish to recog-
nize him as my Iowan of the Week for his out-
standing service to his community. 
Delwyn has been with the Mount Ayr Raid-
ers since 1984, serving in a number of roles 
from teaching social studies, coaching numer-
ous sports, and as athletic director. Under his 
leadership as co-coach of the Mount Ayr foot-
ball team, the program has seen continued 
success with a recent playoff appearance. In 
fact, Delwyn and his co-coach Derek Lambert, 
are the winningest coaches in program history 
with 135 wins in 19 seasons. Even more im-
pressive, the pair has had only one losing 
record. Delwyn’s coaching prowess doesn’t 
end there, however, as he has also coached 
the basketball team to three conference cham-
pionships. 
Beyond leading his teams to victories, 
Coach Showalter has also been a leader for 
his student athletes. His friends and col-
leagues describe him as a caring and sup-
portive man with an ability to lead young men. 
His players talk about his work ethic and how 
he’s a man you can look up to as a mentor. 
He sets high standards for his students yet 
connects through humor and humility. We all 
know that there is much more to high school 
athletics than simply winning, and Coach 
Showalter is an example to all on the positive 
influence a coach can have on young stu-
dent’s lives and their community. 
For Delwyn, sports is also a family affair. 
His two sons, Daniel and David, followed in 
his footsteps. Daniel coaches with his father 
on the Mount Ayr staff and David is a teacher 
and coach in Ackley, Iowa. While I know his 
players and community will miss Delwyn on 
the sidelines, I am sure he’ll stay connected to 
the sport through his family. After 36 years 
with the Mount Ayr Raiders, Delwyn deserves 
this retirement and we all can be thankful for 
his service to his community. I am proud to 
recognize Coach Delwyn Showalter as my 
Iowan of the week.

GHANAIAN COMMUNITY IN 
AMERICA 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 8, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, the United States of America is 
home to hundreds and thousands of people of 
Ghanaian heritage including those who were 
born on this soil to those whose family emi-
grated here for education, job, or economic 
opportunities—for the American dream. 
Ghanaian Americans are an important fabric 
in the tapestry of America from the cab driver 
to the medical doctor. You will find them in all 
parts of the country from Chicago to New York 
to suburban Ohio and Massachusetts. The 
culture is hard to ignore with rich food, the 
iconic Kente cloth, storytelling, inventions, ar-
chitecture, and music. 
Today more than ever Ghanaians living in 
the United States worry about racial injustice, 
home ownership, access to education, access 
to small business and immigration support. 
Like many Americans, the Ghanaian com-
munity in America is not exempt from the 
COVID–19 crisis. Ghanaian Americans are es-
sential workers and are very active in the 
health care industry, especially as nurses, per-
sonal care aides, and nursing assistants. Gha-
naians are included in the 27.5 percent of all 
Black immigrant workers in the U.S.—more 
than 750,000—who work in the healthcare 
sector. Additionally, essential workers include 
frontline workers in other key industries like 
food and service & hospitality and leisure. 
And Ghanaian Americans have been con-
tributing to the success and business con-
tinuity of important industries during these dire 
times. Ghanaian Americans are included in 23 
percent of immigrants in the U.S. who work in 
the food and service industry, as well as 20
