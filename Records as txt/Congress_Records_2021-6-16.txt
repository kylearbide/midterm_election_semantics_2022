HONORING DR. BETSY 
OUDENHOVEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the career of 
Dr. Betsy Oudenhoven, president of the 
Community College of Aurora, and con-
gratulate her on her upcoming retire-
ment. 
Dr. Oudenhoven joined CCA in 2011, 
as the vice president for student af-
fairs. She possessed an extensive lead-
ership background, serving students at 
institutions in Wisconsin, Minnesota, 
New York, and Illinois. 
CCA recognized her commitment and 
exceptional service when they ap-
pointed her president in December 2013. 
In her time at CCA, Dr. Oudenhoven 
is recognized for advancing the institu-
tion’s commitment to diversity and in-
clusion, prioritizing equity, and sup-
porting student success. 
During her tenure, CCA also re-
affirmed its role in the community by 
expanding enrollment in high school 
equivalency and English as a second 
language programs. 
Dr. Oudenhoven faithfully served stu-
dents across the country for 42 years 
and helped transform CCA over the last 
decade. 
I congratulate Dr. Betsy Oudenhoven 
on her retirement and thank her for 
her commitment to our community. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR. 
FELIX GILBERT 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the life of Dr. 
Felix Gilbert following his passing on 
April 27 of this year, 2021. 
Dr. Gilbert was a pastor, an Air 
Force veteran, a professor, a mentor, a 
father, a brother, and a grandfather. He 
built his ministry, Restoration Chris-
tian Fellowship, and the community 
development corporation, Restoration 
Christian Ministries, in Aurora, with 
his wife, Pastor Kotane Gilbert. 
Through these organizations, Dr. Gil-
bert built collaborative partnerships 
with members of the community to 
meet their needs where they live, 
learn, work, play thrive, and worship. 
These efforts include establishing 
Restoration Christian Academy and 
working with the Food Bank of the 
Rockies and the city of Aurora to feed 
hundreds of families per month. 
During the pandemic, Dr. Gilbert de-
voted his time to public health and 
housing. He worked with the city of 
Aurora and UC-Health on testing and 
vaccination efforts, and with Interfaith 
Alliance of Colorado and other local 
agencies to support his ministry’s Af-
fordable Housing and Unhoused Resi-
dents Village Initiatives. 
Dr. Gilbert was an inspiration to his 
community and worked to mentor 
local pastors. To honor his legacy, may 
we strive to build people up and love 
them just as they are. 
CONGRATULATING DEPUTY CITY MANAGER 
NANCY FREED 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Deputy City Man-
ager Nancy Freed and congratulate her 
on her retirement following 28 years of 
service to the city of Aurora. 
During Nancy’s career, she oversaw 
nearly every department in the city. 
Nancy’s impact can be felt across every 
part of Aurora, as she was integral in 
the planning, construction, and oper-
ation of many community services 
across the municipality, including li-
braries and recreation centers. 
Nancy saw Aurora through incredible 
challenges, through drought, unprece-
dented population growth, and tragedy. 
She rose to each occasion, creating the 
Prairie Waters Project, one of the 
country’s first reuse water projects; 
helping plan Colorado’s light rail sys-
tem, including bringing the RTD’s R 
Line to Aurora; and founding the Au-
rora Strong Resilience Center and the 
7/20 Memorial Garden project following 
the 2012 Aurora Theater shooting. 
In 2018, Nancy was named an Unsung 
Hero of Aurora by the Aurora Chamber 
of Commerce. 
A powerhouse of knowledge and cre-
ativity, I thank Nancy for her dedi-
cated service and leadership. 
RECOGNIZING ARAPAHOE RESCUE PATROL 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the lifesaving 
work of the Arapahoe Rescue Patrol. 
Formed in 1957, in Arapahoe County, 
Colorado, the search and rescue oper-
ations by this team are managed by 
local high school students. These stu-
dents dedicate hundreds of hours to

field search and rescue training, wil-
derness survival, winter operations, 
aircraft crash rescue, and more. They 
live their high school career on call 
prepared to save lives. 
When a person is lost in the Colorado 
mountains, the patrol’s teenage volun-
teers handle dispatch, patrolling, ac-
tive search and rescue, emergency 
medical care, and command of the op-
eration. 
In towns like Littleton, Englewood, 
and 
Aurora, 
they 
manage 
block 
searches and neighborhood canvassing 
to find lost children and elderly neigh-
bors. Patrol members are also on scene 
for disasters like blizzards, floods, 
chemical spills, and commercial plane 
crashes, providing assistance to local 
police, fire, and the sheriff department. 
I am proud to take a moment to 
honor the hundreds of young heroes 
who served admirably in the Arapahoe 
Rescue Patrol over the last 60 years, 
balancing their high school careers 
with the commitment to saving lives. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to these 
dedicated, service-minded young folks. 
f 
THE SIREN SONG OF EARMARKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
ever since the Magna Carta, it has been 
a settled principle of good governance 
that the power that appropriates public 
funds should not be the same power 
that spends them. This is at the heart 
of our Constitution, the separation of 
powers. 
Simply speaking, it is mother’s rule 
writ large. Mother has one slice of pie 
left and two hungry sons. How does she 
cut the pie so that both brothers are 
satisfied? One slices, the other chooses. 
One brother cannot abuse his powers 
precisely because of the powers ac-
corded to the other. 
And it is the same with our Constitu-
tion. One brother makes law, but can-
not enforce it; the other enforces law, 
but cannot make it. One brother appro-
priates money, but cannot spend it; the 
other spends money, but cannot appro-
priate it. 
Now, imagine how differently moth-
er’s rule would work if the same broth-
er who sliced the pie also chose his 
piece. 
Yet that is exactly the principle of 
congressional earmarks: Choosing the 
same slice of pie you have just cut or, 
more precisely, spending the same 
money that you have just appro-
priated. Nearly 1,500 earmarks, total-
ing $5.7 billion, have been dropped into 
the so-called infrastructure bill alone 
since a bipartisan spending frenzy re-
vived this corrupt practice this year. 
This monumentally bad idea rests on 
two arguments. The first is that elect-
ed Members of Congress, and not 
unelected bureaucrats, should spend 
the people’s money. The problem, of 
course, is that Representatives aren’t 
elected by all the people, only by their 
distinct 
constituencies. 
Representa-
tives are inherently biased toward 
their own districts. That is why Con-
gress is designed to act collectively. 
Only the executive answers to the en-
tire Nation and can resist the manifest 
excesses of a body controlled by 535 de-
manding constituencies and their dis-
trict-focused Representatives. That is 
why appropriating money is a congres-
sional function, and spending it is an 
executive one. 
The second argument is that ear-
marks can grease legislation by buying 
off the votes of individual Members 
whose judgment would otherwise op-
pose a measure. Add a few local 
projects for that Member, and suddenly 
a bill he would never vote for on its 
merits becomes a local imperative 
overriding his sound judgment. 
Please explain to me how that is a 
good thing. 
And if earmarks are to be handed out 
as a reward for voting legislation, 
Members will prudently keep a list of 
earmarks handy as the demand for vote 
for any bill, whether or not they al-
ready plan to vote for it. 
And this is not a theoretical discus-
sion. We have learned the hard way 
what comes from breaching the Con-
stitution’s checks and balances. 
The first problem is the corrupting 
nature of earmarks. When we place the 
power to appropriate and the power to 
spend in the same hands, we bypass the 
most important check that we have 
against corruption. 
A local company produces a product 
the Pentagon neither needs nor wants. 
Well, what to do? 
Ingratiate yourself with the local 
Congressman; have him tell the Pen-
tagon what it needs and who will pro-
vide it; and then reward him lavishly 
at election time and repeat. It should 
come as no surprise that many of the 
congressional scandals of the 1990s and 
2000s arose from earmarks. 
Second, earmarks bypass the normal 
process in which projects compete on 
their merits. Worthy projects don’t 
need earmarks if appropriations are 
spent by the executive branch, accord-
ing to well-established competitive, 
open-bid 
procedures. 
Earmarks 
are 
only required to protect unworthy 
projects from merit-driven competi-
tion. And even if there is such a thing 
as a good earmark, the price invariably 
is logrolling all the bad ones. 
Third, earmarks harm the central 
tenet of federalism: That local projects 
should be financed by local commu-
nities, and Federal expenditures re-
served for the Nation’s general welfare. 
When a local government proposes an 
earmark, what is it saying? 
It is saying the project is so low on 
its priority list, it won’t spend its own 
local taxpayers funds; but it is per-
fectly happy to have taxpayers in other 
communities foot the bill. The result is 
a grab bag of dubious projects that rob 
St. Petersburg to pay St. Paul for 
projects St. Petersburg doesn’t deem 
worthy enough to spend its own funds 
on, and that St. Paul pays for but re-
ceives no benefit from. 
We have sung this old song many 
times before and it has never ended 
well.

REPEAL AUTHORIZATION FOR USE 
OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST 
IRAQ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
urge all my colleagues to join me in 
voting for H.R. 256, Congresswoman 
LEE’s legislation to repeal the 2002 Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force 
against Iraq. 
In 2002, Congress voted to authorize 
the use of force against Iraq based on 
what would later prove to be false, 
baseless, and misleading intelligence 
provided by the Bush administration. A 
year later, Saddam Hussein was over-
thrown; a democratic government was 
established; and, finally, in 2011, a for-
mal declaration of the end of our mis-
sion was announced. 
But 10 years later, this authorization 
for the use of force remains on the 
books. 
We must repeal this 19-year-old au-
thorization that has been used and 
abused to justify expansive military 
actions across the globe. If we are seri-
ous about preventing forever wars, we 
must repeal the AUMF and exercise 
Congress’ constitutional authority to 
declare war and peace. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this impor-
tant legislation. 
INCREASING CORPORATE BOARD DIVERSITY 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I also rise in 
support of H.R. 1187, the Corporate 
Governance Improvement and Investor 
Protection Act, and, specifically, the 
Meeks-Maloney amendment that we 
will consider today. 
We show our priorities by our ac-
tions; and, today, we are not just talk-
ing about diversity, we are acting to 
improve diversity in the corporate 
boardroom. 
I want to thank Mr. MEEKS, the spon-
sor of this amendment. He and I have 
worked on this issue a long time to-
gether, and I thank him for his leader-
ship. 
The goal of our amendment, the Im-
proving Corporate Governance Through 
Diversity Act, is extremely important, 
increasing 
diversity 
on 
corporate 
boards. This is something I believe in 
passionately; and while we have made 
great progress, we still have a long way 
to go. 
Getting more women, minorities, and 
individuals from historically underrep-
resented communities into corporate 
leadership positions is extremely im-
portant. Leaders set the tone, and they 
set the priorities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2823 
June 16, 2021 
Back in 2015, I asked the Government 
Accountability Office to look at the 
gender makeup of corporate boards, 
and the results were discouraging, and 
they convinced me that we need to do 
more. 
Women make up roughly 47 percent 
of the workforce, yet they hold roughly 
29 percent of corporate board seats. 
The GAO found that even if we assume 
that equal proportions of women and 
men started joining boards starting 
right now, it would take more than 40 
years for there to be an equal number 
of women and men in the corporate 
boardrooms. 
We can’t wait 40 years for parity. 
Something needs to change. 
But let’s also be clear: Increasing di-
versity on corporate boards is not just 
a moral issue; it is good for business, 
too. Study after study has shown that 
companies with greater diversity on 
their boards perform better financially, 
which is why investors want the com-
panies they invest in to make diversity 
a priority. 
In fact, I started working on this bill 
at the request of investors and investor 
organizations that wanted to more eas-
ily be able to track diversity on boards. 
This legislation would help investors 
accomplish this by requiring public 
companies to report the voluntary, 
self-identified racial, ethnic, gender 
identity, and sexual orientation com-
position of their board members and 
executive officers in their annual proxy 
statement. 
b 1015 
By putting this information in one 
place for investors, the bill would help 
investors to quickly sort the compa-
nies that do and do not have diverse 
boards. 
The legislation would also establish a 
diversity advisory group at the SEC, 
which would study strategies to in-
crease diversity on corporate boards 
because the truth is that making 
meaningful progress on board diversity 
is going to require a range of different 
policies in addition to the improved 
disclosures in this legislation. 
The diversity advisory group at the 
SEC would continue to study these 
issues and would continue to make rec-
ommendations of best policies for the 
future. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
effort, support this bill, support our 
amendment, and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 
1187.

HONORING MICKEY STEPHENS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Georgia Representative Mickey 
Stephens for his remarkable career in 
the Georgia General Assembly. 
Mr. Stephens is a native of Savannah 
and a proud graduate of Savannah 
State College. He served one term in 
2002 and was reelected in 2014 to the 
Georgia House, representing the 165th 
District. 
As an educator, he was a great asset 
to Savannah High School, Shuman 
Middle School, and John W. Hubert 
Middle School. Additionally, he served 
on 
the 
Savannah-Chatham 
County 
Board of Public Education and the Sa-
vannah Zoning Board of Appeals. 
Mr. Stephens is known throughout 
Georgia for his civic service, including 
his commitment to the community and 
his efforts in supporting the education 
of youth and adults. 
Thank you, Mr. Stephens, for all of 
your hard work to make Savannah a 
better place to live. You are an inspira-
tion to us all about giving back to your 
community. 
REMEMBERING MICHAEL MAMALAKIS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Michael 
Mamalakis of Savannah, Georgia, who 
passed away on May 16 at the age of 37. 
Michael was a lifelong resident of Sa-
vannah and a graduate of Jenkins High 
School. 
He had many passions in his life, but 
one of his greatest passions was the Sa-
vannah Country Day School sports 
teams. 
Michael spent 20 years inspiring ath-
letes with his incredible spirit and un-
surpassed devotion. He taught players 
and coaches alike that passion, effort, 
and dedication are far more important 
in sports than wins and losses. 
In 2014, Michael was honored as Sa-
vannah Country Day School’s Best of 
Preps Unsung Hero. 
He touched many lives in the Savan-
nah community, and his irreplaceable 
presence will be missed by all. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him, 
during this most difficult time. 
CONGRATULATING DAVION MITCHELL 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Davion Mitchell for winning the 2021 
NCAA men’s basketball national cham-
pionship with Baylor University. 
Davion has never been a stranger to 
achieving success and making an im-
pact on his team. 
During his time at Liberty County 
High School in Hinesville, in the First 
Congressional 
District 
of 
Georgia, 
Davion led his team to their first State 
title in school history. 
As a junior at Baylor University, 
Davion led Baylor in an impressive sea-
son that resulted in a win over Gonzaga 
in the national championship game. 
Some of Davion’s impressive acco-
lades include the AP All-American 
Team, the All-Big 12 First Team, the 
2021 All-Tournament Team, and the 
National Defensive Player of the Year. 
Davion’s long list of accomplish-
ments stems from his countless hours 
of work and his determination to win. 
I, along with the rest of the First 
Congressional 
District, 
congratulate 
you, Davion, on your achievements and 
know that you will continue to make 
us proud. 
HONORING CARL HAMILTON ALEXANDER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor retired Chief of Police Carl Ham-
ilton Alexander of Brunswick, Georgia, 
who peacefully passed away at the age 
of 72. 
Chief Alexander was a man of strong 
character and deep devotion to his life-
long profession of public service. 
He began his career in public service 
with the Glynn County Fire-Rescue in 
1970, and he would eventually rise 
through the ranks of the police depart-
ment to become chief of police. 
Under his leadership, 
the 
Glynn 
County Police Department became the 
14th nationally accredited agency in 
the State in 1994. 
Chief 
Alexander 
modernized 
the 
county emergency radio system and 
brought computer technology into po-
lice vehicles. 
Through every position he had, he 
worked to better his community and 
every life he touched. His commitment 
to Glynn County has changed countless 
lives, and we are forever grateful. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
f 
HONORING MARCOS MUNOZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor my 
friend and activist Marcos Munoz, who 
lived a life of service and commitment 
to workers’ rights. 
Marcos 
migrated 
to 
the 
United 
States from Coahuila, Mexico, when he 
was 13 years old. He was looking to 
make money to help his mother and his 
siblings after his father left them. 
He worked for a Texas rancher, who 
had him deported when Marcos asked 
for money he was owed after 5 months 
of backbreaking work. 
When Marcos returned to the U.S. in 
his twenties, the abuse he experienced 
turned him into an activist, fighting 
for basic labor rights for farmworkers. 
The late Cesar Chavez, leader of the 
United 
Farm 
Workers, 
recognized 
Marcos’ leadership skills and asked 
him to lead efforts across the United 
States on behalf of the United Farm 
Workers union. 
I met Marcos when he came to Chi-
cago seeking support for the second 
grape boycott. I was a student at the 
University of Illinois at Chicago and 
learned a lot about labor organizing 
from him. 
Marcos later made Chicago his home, 
settling in our neighborhood of Little 
Village, where he organized block clubs 
to create unity and elect representa-
tives from the community. 
He 
later 
became 
a 
steelworker, 
joined the United Steelworkers union, 
and spent his last years before retire-
ment as manager of supplies and linen 
at Cook County Hospital. 
Marcos passed away on May 15. I was 
lucky to call Marcos a mentor and a

SUPPORTING UNITED STATES 
SPACE FORCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARCI´A) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GARCI´A of California. Madam 
Speaker, mankind has existed on this 
beautiful blue marble that we call 
Earth for nearly 200,000 years. Yet, just 
118 years ago, we learned to fly in our 
own planet’s atmosphere. 
As a nation, we are thirsty for some-
thing to rally behind, something that 
unifies us, something that we can all 
be invested in, be intrigued by, be im-
passioned about, and something to be 
positive about. 
There isn’t a better movement to get 
behind than our Nation’s modern space 
program. Some question the value of 
spending precious taxpayer dollars to 
overcome our planet’s gravity to go to 
space, but those people aren’t seeing 
the big picture. 
In the early 1900s, many questioned 
the value of spending so much capital 
and risking so many lives in hopes of 
conquering flight, and now we can’t 
imagine a world in which we don’t have 
the luxury of modern aviation. 
We had no idea that a little canvas 
glider flown on a beach in North Caro-
lina would evolve into the modern 
fighter jet. 
We have no choice but to think out-
side the box, think outside of our own 
solar system even, to make sure that 
we not only understand the answers to 
our most profound questions but also 
discover new questions for tomorrow 
that we can’t even fathom asking 
today. 
We have no choice but to better un-
derstand the extensions of God’s cre-
ations, to know if we are alone in the 
universe, to know if there is a second 
home somewhere out there beyond our 
sights and imaginations. 
Failing to press on is a disservice to 
previous generations who have sac-
rificed so much and worked so hard to 
get us here today. Failing to press on is 
a disservice to current and future gen-
erations who benefit from our progress 
today. 
You see, space is a domain where we, 
as a nation, can thrive, but it is also a 
domain where we can be vulnerable and 
susceptible to the malicious intent of 
foes such as China, Russia, and Iran. 
There are existential threats right now 
in space. 
Any decision on our part to divest 
from this adventure will not dissuade 
our foes from advancing their own 
space programs. It would only serve to 
highlight a massive strategic vulnera-
bility and potentially create capability 
gaps that will be impossible to fill in 
the future. 
A path of divestment is an unfor-
giving one and the damages irrep-
arable. While we as a nation currently 
hold an advantage in space, our lead, 
like the nearly 118 years that separates 
today from the Wright brothers’ first 
flight in 1903, can vanish in the blink of 
an eye. 
In this new frontier, time is as pre-
cious as money. Now is not the time to 
slow down. 
As big as space is, we must, as a na-
tion, be bigger, be bigger as a united 
team. As a nation, we must recognize 
that this investment in our future is 
more than science and curiosity; it is 
more than resolve and perseverance; 
and it is more than just discovery and 
challenges. It is about survival, excel-
lence, and inspiration; it is about na-
tional security; and it is about plan-
etary security against threats that are 
not slowing down. It is about a new 
golden era for the American space pro-
gram. 
As a result of the construction of the 
International Space Station, we have 
not had all humans together on this 
planet for over 20 years. That is re-
markable to think about. 
In 2020, SpaceX, a critical commer-
cial partner in our quest for low-cost 
and frequent space travel, averaged one 
rocket launch every 2 weeks. That is 26 
launches in a year or almost three 
times the number of flights that the 
space shuttle did in its best year. 
Earlier this year, NASA successfully 
landed a JPL Mars rover on the Mar-
tian surface for the fifth time. We were 
the first and only nation to have done 
this until recently when the UAE and 
China just landed on Mars. 
In April, we flew a helicopter in the 
Martian atmosphere. No other nation 
has done that, but the United States 
now has. 
In 2024, we plan to once again land 
Americans on the Moon and further 
make history with the first woman on 
the Moon. Still, to this day, no other 
nation has done that. 
During our lifetimes, we will land 
Americans on Mars. No other nation 
has done that. The U.S. will be the 
first. 
As Americans, we are, in fact, excep-
tional. Our successes in space are testi-
monies to this. We should take pride in 
those successes, take pride in our 
exceptionalism, especially in the space 
domain. 
In 1962, JFK had to inspire us with 
his moonshot speech. Today, we have 
no excuses not to be inspired. We in 
Congress have no excuses to not sup-
port these exceptional programs in ear-
nest and with pride. We have no choice.

URGING SENATE TO PASS FOR 
THE PEOPLE ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge the Senate to pass 
the For the People Act, or H.R. 1. 
This 
urgently 
needed 
legislation 
would fight corruption and the over-
whelming influence of money in poli-
tics by strengthening ethics rules and 
reforming our campaign finance sys-
tem. 
It would protect the foundation of 
our democracy, the right to vote, at a 
time when it is under attack in many 
States. 
I am proud that my home State of Il-
linois is not one of them. In fact, our 
legislature recently voted to expand 
ballot access. But for those who aren’t 
lucky enough to live in Illinois, H.R. 1 
is a much-needed defense against wide-
spread voter suppression. 
As the Senate considers these long- 
overdue reforms, I rise today, here in 
the House of Representatives, to insist 
that representation matters. 
That is Congress’ role in our rep-
resentative democracy: to represent 
the American people. If the Members 
elected to this Chamber don’t represent 
the diversity of the American people’s 
backgrounds and their experiences, we 
can’t do a good job of representing 
their perspectives and advocating for 
their needs. 
Consider that women make up just 
over a quarter of the 117th Congress, 
and that is the highest percentage it 
has ever been. We see the effects of this 
lack of diversity in the way our gov-
ernment works for women, or, rather, 
the fact that it doesn’t work for 
women. 
Women have been hit harder than 
men by job loss during the pandemic. 
This is partly because women still do 
more childcare than men, and the pan-
demic triggered a childcare crisis. But 
this doesn’t come out of nowhere. It is 
a result of chronic failure to address 
areas that disproportionately impact 
women. 
Because women haven’t had a seat at 
the table, our needs have been side-
lined. As a result, everybody loses, not 
just women. All Americans are part of 
an economy that depends on childcare 
to function. 
It is no coincidence that the Biden- 
Harris administration’s bold plan to in-
vest in human infrastructure comes 
just months after our first female Vice 
President was sworn in. This is just one 
of many instances in which everybody 
benefits when different perspectives 
and life experiences are represented in 
our elected leadership. 
When we talk about candidate diver-
sity, we are talking about growing our 
economy, 
improving 
childcare, 
and 
strengthening our infrastructure. Good 
policy starts with good representation. 
H.R. 1 will give Americans the gov-
ernment we deserve by enabling us to 
elect people who truly represent us. 
One of the most important provisions 
in the bill for improving representation 
is the creation of a small-donor public 
financing program. 
b 1030 
In the States and cities where it is 
already in use, public financing is pop-
ular because it empowers candidates to 
get their message out to voters, even if

they don’t have deep pockets or cor-
porate connections. 
But the Brennan Center for Justice 
found that public financing doesn’t just 
increase the socioeconomic diversity of 
candidates for public office, it also 
boosts racial and gender diversity. 
That is why I introduced an amend-
ment to H.R. 1 to include an assess-
ment of the impact on candidate diver-
sity in the required report to Congress 
on the new public financing program, 
and I am grateful that my colleagues 
voted to pass my amendment. 
This is personal for me because I 
firmly believe that we can have a Con-
gress that looks like America if we just 
give people a fair shot. 
I became the first woman and the 
first person of color to represent my 
district because I refused to be counted 
out as unelectable in my own commu-
nity. I know that women and people of 
color are electable everywhere. No seat 
in Congress should be deemed out of 
reach for certain types of candidates. 
When everybody has a fair shot, all 
candidates are electable, and small 
donor public financing gives people 
that fair shot. Small donor public fi-
nancing and the other crucial reforms 
in H.R. 1 would make our representa-
tive democracy both more representa-
tive and more democratic. In other 
words, it would make America more 
American, aligning our system of gov-
ernment with our highest national val-
ues. 
So I urge my colleagues in the Sen-
ate to pass the For the People Act with 
the small donor public financing pro-
gram intact and help America live up 
to our values.

REMEMBERING MARINE CORPORAL 
JEFFREY STANDFEST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the memory of Ma-
rine Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest, 
a St. Clair County native who was 
killed while serving his country 11 
years ago today. 
Corporal Standfest was only 23 years 
old when an IED struck and killed him 
and his K–9 partner, Sergeant Rupert, 
in Afghanistan. 
Like all of our fallen heroes, Jeff was 
not just a soldier in war. He was a son, 
a brother, a nephew, a grandson, and a 
friend. A star runner at St. Clair High 
School, Jeff was an all-American kid 
who loved his country and followed in 
the footsteps of his grandfather by 
serving in the Marine Corps. This is 
who he was, and this is how he will be 
remembered. 
I recently introduced bipartisan leg-
islation to rename the St. Clair County 
Post Office after Corporal Standfest. 
Renaming this post office would serve 
as a permanent reminder of his selfless 
service to our country. To his friends, 
family, and loved ones, it will dem-
onstrate that the United States will 
never forget his bravery and ultimate 
sacrifice. 
It 
is 
the 
courage 
of 
Corporal 
Standfest and all of those who have 
worn the uniform that protects the 
freedoms we hold so dear. 
Today, on the anniversary of his 
tragic death, I hope all of those who 
knew and loved him find comfort 
knowing that Corporal Jeffrey Robert 
Standfest will forever be remembered 
in history as a patriotic American 
hero. I am hopeful my colleagues in 
Congress will join me in honoring this 
courageous American. 
f 
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR 
GEORGIANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to address a serious problem 
facing our country, one that many of 
us have been dealing with firsthand 
since the beginning of the COVID–19 
crisis. As I do so, I also want to ac-
knowledge that while we are headed in 
the right direction, earlier this week 
we crossed the solemn milestone of 
more than 600,000 American lives lost 
in the pandemic. 
Today, I speak for millions of Ameri-
cans from across the country who lost 
their jobs as a result of COVID–19. 
They then did exactly what they had 
been told to do and filed for unemploy-
ment insurance, and then they waited. 
But in Georgia, for many, that unem-
ployment check never came. 
Many of us have received a flood of 
calls and emails regarding this issue. 
Currently, my office is processing near-
ly 150 cases dealing with unemploy-
ment insurance, our second highest of 
any issue area, and the stories are 
truly frustrating. 
There is a substitute teacher in my 
district who couldn’t find work due to 
the COVID pandemic. When Georgia 
schools reopened to in-person instruc-
tion, she was unable to go back, as she 
lives with a high-risk family member. 
In April of 2020, she applied for unem-
ployment benefits and received them 
for just a short amount of time before 
they 
mysteriously 
stopped, 
even 
though she is still eligible. She con-
tacted my office in February, and we 
have sent five inquiries on her behalf, 
and not a word of response from the 
Georgia Department of Labor. 
We have another person who was ap-
proved for benefits in July and began 
filing claims weekly but has never re-
ceived a single cent. That person con-
tacted our office in March. We sent 
four inquiries. Not a word in response 
from the Georgia Department of Labor. 
Let me be clear: This isn’t just the 
slow gears of government bureaucracy. 
Every day delayed means a human 
being has to decide between putting 
food on the table or keeping a roof over 
their heads. One such person my office 
has talked to had their car repossessed 
and are on the verge of eviction be-
cause their government can’t get it to-
gether. 
Along with the rest of the Georgia 
Democratic congressional delegation, I 
sent a letter in March asking the U.S. 
Department of Labor’s Office of the In-
spector General to conduct an audit of 
the Georgia Department of Labor, and 
they recently replied. 
What they found was that they 
couldn’t figure out what was going on 
because Georgia couldn’t even supply 
basic data on a number of key issues, 
including the timeliness of benefit dis-
tribution and the number of Georgians 
who requested the federally funded un-
employment insurance supplement. 
There are two other States which 
were unable to provide data on the 
timeliness of claims through all three 
Federal enhanced unemployment in-
surance programs. There were four 
other States which apparently did not 
report the required claims volume 
data. Georgia is the only State that 
was unable to provide data on either. 
In other words, the Georgia Depart-
ment of Labor stands out as uniquely 
unable, by either choice or com-
petence, to report on its administra-
tion of enhanced unemployment bene-
fits. 
While factors such as initial under-
staffing and limited technology may 
have prevented the Georgia Depart-
ment of Labor from processing claims, 
after over a year and after over 67 mil-
lion in Federal dollars to help the 
State, 
extensive 
questions 
remain 
about how the agency plans to identify 
solutions to address the serious back-
log that currently exists. 
Georgians are lawfully entitled to 
the benefits they applied for. They are 
also entitled to transparency and ac-
countability from their government. It 
is time for answers and for solutions.

CLARENCE CUMMINGS, JR. IS 
OLYMPIC BOUND 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with great honor and pride to an-
nounce that Clarence Cummings, Jr., a 
21-year-old constituent of mine from 
Beaufort, South Carolina, will be an 
important part of the 2021 Olympic 
weightlifting team and their effort to 
bring home the first gold in over 60 
years for the red, white, and blue. 
Mr. Cummings’ record is extensive, 
to say the least. He holds 23 American 
records in weightlifting. In his weight 
class, he holds the Junior World Record 
in the snatch, clean and jerk, and 
total. 
He is world respected and well re-
garded for his feat in the clean and 
jerk. 
He was the IWF Junior World Cham-
pion in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. In 2016 
and 2017 he was the IWF Youth World 
Champion. He is also the Pan-Amer-
ican Champion for 2019 and 2020. I also

I am immensely proud, as I know ev-

determination and dedication he has 
given to his sport and to his country. 
I cannot wait to watch him win the

REPEAL THE 2002 IRAQ AUMF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to end the 
war in Iraq. That is right, it is still 
going on. The 2002 AUMF that author-
ized military force in the Iraq war is 
still active, but today we will be voting 
on it, and it is long past due for us to 
vote on it. The original text of the 2002 
AUMF was disturbingly broad and au-
thorizes the United States military to 
enforce United Nations Security Coun-
cil resolutions. 
We have wasted $750 million on the 
world’s largest embassy in Iraq. When 
we get out of Iraq, it is time to put a 
for sale sign on that embassy. We may 
get only pennies on the dollar for that 
embassy, but that is better than sacri-
ficing lives. We don’t want another 
Libya; we don’t want another Benghazi 
to happen in Iraq. It is time to scale 
down the embassy, put what is there 
for sale, and bring our troops and our 
diplomats home. 
Saddam Hussein’s regime was de-
feated in 2003. That is 18 years ago. 
Obama declared the Iraq war ended in 
2011. But the AUMF was never re-
pealed, and it gives a blank check to 
any current or subsequent administra-
tion to keep American soldiers in Iraq 
indefinitely and puts us at risk of get-
ting into another war if things esca-
late. 
By 2013, a majority of Americans be-
lieved that the Iraq war was a mistake. 
Approximately 4,586 U.S. soldiers have 
died in Iraq, lost their lives since the 
beginning of the war, and 32,000 have 
been seriously wounded or injured in 
Iraq since the start of the war. 
Although it is hard to know the esti-
mated number of civilian casualties 
during this period of time in Iraq, it is 
somewhere between 800,000 and 1.3 mil-
lion civilians. Think about that. A mil-
lion civilians have died in this conflict. 
It is time for us to leave. We owe it 
to our soldiers. They signed up to pro-
tect our country. They didn’t sign up 
to be the world’s policemen. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF today. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO MARY DUFFY 
SHEAFFER BURTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and pay tribute to 
Mary 
Duffy 
Sheaffer 
Burton, 
who 
passed away earlier this year. I cer-
tainly appreciated Mary’s friendship 
and support over the last several dec-
ades. She was an incredible lady. 
Mary 
made 
an 
indelible 
mark 
through her works and service to the 
Lancaster County community. She was 
a lifelong entrepreneur, a pioneer of 
the manufacturing industry in Lan-
caster, starting her first business in 
her garage, HDJ Company, in 1960, 
which became a leader in the design 
and manufacture of precision machin-
ing parts and would later become spe-
cialized medical devices and implants. 
Her businesses would employ many 
individuals over the years, building 
lasting relationships with many, posi-
tively impacting their lives. 
Mary received the Golden Microm-
eter Award from the Precision Ma-
chined Products Association of Amer-
ica, which is the highest honor of the 
industry in 2008 and was a recognition 
of her outstanding efforts and achieve-
ment. 
She was just as devoted to improving 
her community, generously supporting, 
with her time and talents, many orga-
nizations 
which 
built 
Lancaster’s 
thriving arts community, historical or-
ganizations, and organizations sup-
porting women and children. 
Mary is survived by her three chil-
dren, who we express our sincerest con-
dolences to, Duffy, Mary, and Edward, 
and by her grandchildren and her 
great-grandchildren. 
We are sad at Mary’s passing, but she 
brought happiness to the lives of so 
many, and for that we give thanks. 
TAXING THE MIDDLE CLASS 
Mr. 
SMUCKER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
President Biden is raising taxes on the 
middle class. Make no mistake about 
it. Middle-class Americans are feeling 
the squeeze of inflation as well—at the 
gas pump, at the grocery store, at the 
hardware store, and everywhere in be-
tween—as a result of the President’s 
reckless 
Big 
Government 
spending 
plans. 
This irresponsible $6 trillion budget 
doubles down on taxing the middle 
class, breaking his pledge to only tax 
the wealthy. And we know he wants to 
tax the middle class because the Presi-
dent’s budget would let the working- 
and middle-class tax hikes from the 
Tax Cut and Jobs Act expire. 
b 1045 
By the way, from 2017 to 2019, the 
TCJA raised the median household in-
come by over $5,000. This was a real 
positive impact for families across the 
district that I represent, for families 
across the country. And it also led to 
the lowest poverty rate in history, lift-
ing more people out of poverty than 
ever before and historically slow unem-
ployment. 
But, apparently, Biden wants to 
throw away those policies that built 
the strongest economy that we have 
seen in generations and, instead, will 
force greater dependence on the Fed-
eral Government. 
Even with all of the radical socialist 
policies included in the President’s 
budget, their own projections indicate 
the worst economic growth of any dec-
ade since the Great Depression, at the 
cost of more than $17 trillion added to 
the national debt. 
Madam Speaker, the President says 
he wants to build back better, but I 
fear that he will end up building back 
bankrupt. 
America can simply not afford his 
middle-class tax hikes and socialist 
spending wish list.

and call on You. We are impatient to 
hear Your word. Hurry to our assist-
ance. 
May our prayers be like incense be-
fore You. 
May the effort of our hands be as a 
sacrifice to You. 
Set a guard over our mouths, O Lord. 
Watch over the words that come from 
our lips. Do not let the thoughts that 
emerge into speech be shaped with evil 
intent. 
And do not allow our hearts to be in-
clined to compete in wrongdoing with 
those who wrong us. 
But may our eyes be ever on You, for 
in You do we find shelter. And to You 
we entrust our whole selves. 
We pray this in the strength of Your 
name. 
Amen.

ACT ON UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND 
CHECKS 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, last Sat-
urday, we remembered the murder of 49 
people at the Pulse massacre 5 years 
ago. Tomorrow, we will mourn 6 years 
since nine people were killed in their 
place of worship at Mother Emanuel 
AME Church. 
It sits with me every single day that 
in this country we lose friends and 
family to the tragic and avoidable 
scourge of gun violence. 
As of this weekend, we have reached 
272 mass shootings in this country. It is 
madness. These acts of violence, some-
times motivated by hate, continue. 
Yet, we—and the Senate in par-
ticular—have failed to enact common-
sense gun violence prevention legisla-
tion that would stem bloodshed and 
end this loss. I implore the Senate to 
hear the cries of those in their commu-
nities, our constituents, and pass the 
two universal background check bills 
that the House sent over to the Senate 
in March. 
Families should no longer have to 
bury their loved ones when we have the 
ability and the responsibility to close 
deadly loopholes in our system. 
Gun ownership is an important part 
of our American culture and our Con-
stitution, and now is our chance to 
come together in a way that preserves 
this part of our heritage while pro-
tecting our constituents and saving 
lives.

HONORING ROBYN RICHARDSON 
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a milestone in the 
life of one of Russellville, Arkansas’ 
most admired citizens, Robyn Richard-
son. 
He is a beloved fixture in the commu-
nity and one of the River Valley’s big-
gest sports fans. I first got to know 
Richardson when playing football for 
my alma mater, Russellville High 
School, and, later, Arkansas Tech Uni-
versity. Robyn never missed a game. 
I will always remember him in the 
end zone of football games, ready to 
catch field goals and extra points, then 
promptly returning the football to the 
game officials. He was as much a part 
of the game as the players on the field. 
But, Mr. Speaker, the milestone I 
speak of is the fact that he is now the 
longest-serving 
employee 
of 
Pope 
County, Arkansas, celebrating his 50th 
anniversary of employment. 
I had the pleasure of joining the city 
and county last week in a tribute to 
Robyn’s service. Not surprisingly, he 
told me he feels great and has no inten-
tion of retiring anytime soon. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of Robyn 
Richardson, and I want the Nation to 
hear of his amazing record of service. 
Congratulations to my friend.

CONGRESS SHOULD MAKE 
DECISIONS TO DECLARE WAR 
(Mr. WELCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, the most 
solemn decision a country can make is 
to send its sons and daughters to war. 
The most solemn responsibility Con-
gress has is to make that decision. Yet, 
Congress has delegated that authority 
too often and too long to the executive. 
It resulted from an AUMF vote, Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force, 
for a lie-based war in Iraq, resulting in 
the loss of life of over 4,500 of our fel-
low citizens, 200,000 Iraqis killed, and 
destruction and instability in the Mid-
dle East. 
That authorization will be repealed 
by a vote of Congress, and I will vote to 
repeal that authorization and restore 
to the Congress its responsibility to 
make 
that 
solemn 
decision 
about 
whether and when we send our sons and 
daughters to defend us abroad. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF THE HELP 
WANTED ACT 
(Mr. JACOBS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
legislation, 
the 
Help 
Wanted 
Act, 
which would reinstate work search re-
quirements for unemployment benefits 
and end disincentives to work. 
We have now gotten two job reports 
that fell short of projections. Mean-
while, it was reported that there were 
a record 9.3 million job openings in the 
United States. 
In my home of western New York, 
there are reports that restaurants are 
turning customers away when they 
need them most because they are 
short-staffed. 
In February, the Congressional Budg-
et Office published a report stating our 
economy would return to pre-pandemic 
strength without additional govern-
ment spending. Yet, the President and 
Democrats forced through a highly par-
tisan and unrelated $2 trillion package. 
The result is it has now become more 
lucrative to stay at home than to seek 
employment, a detriment to our over-
all economic recovery. 
Vaccines are rolling out; the CDC has 
updated their guidance; and positivity 
rates are dropping. It is time to get 
back to work.

CONGRATULATING 
BOULDER 
COUNTY, 
COLORADO, 
ON 
JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION 
(Mr. NEGUSE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Boulder County 
on their inaugural Juneteenth celebra-
tion this year. 
In 1863, President Lincoln issued the 
Emancipation Proclamation, freeing 
millions of enslaved people. Two years 
later, on June 19, 1865, the impact of 
this 
proclamation 
reached 
Texas, 
where the last enslaved people were 
liberated when Union soldiers marched 
into Galveston to deliver the news. 
Over 150 years have since passed, and 
while there is still much work to be 
done in the fight for racial justice and 
equality, we celebrate the resilience of 
Black Americans and the long struggle 
for freedom and justice that they have 
led. 
I am incredibly proud that Boulder 
County 
is 
holding 
an 
inaugural 
Juneteenth event. By exposing more 
people to the importance of this day 
and educating our community, we have 
the power to make a difference in Boul-
der County. 
Thank you to everyone for putting 
the work in to organize this event, and 
I look forward to celebrating the event 
with you.

H2828 
June 16, 2021 
life of Brycen Gray, a talented and 
bright young man who was sadly taken 
away from us this past April. 
A native of Strongsville, in my dis-
trict, Brycen was a student-athlete at 
St. Edward High School. Dubbed a co-
median by his friends and family, he 
had the power to bring a smile and joy 
to everyone he encountered. 
Unfortunately, we lost Brycen in 
April. Following a battle with COVID– 
19, Brycen began to exhibit symptoms 
associated 
with 
COVID 
psychosis. 
Though he fought to the bitter end, he 
tragically passed after taking his own 
life. 
Mr. Speaker, when I hear these sto-
ries and when I talk to the family, it is 
impossible not to get emotional. We 
lost a gifted, talented young man. And 
the hurt and pain that is inflicted upon 
those left behind is something no one 
should ever have to endure. 
This is a moment where we should 
turn grief into action and actively find 
solutions. To start, we should work 
with the scientific community to gain 
a better understanding of the mental 
health implications of COVID–19 on 
Americans and other root causes of sui-
cide, in particular amongst young 
Americans. This will help us look for 
further warning signs and make sure 
that young Americans get the help 
that they need. 
We must not let Brycen’s memory be 
forgotten. I pray for his parents, Shawn 
and Tara, and his two brothers, Ricky 
and Patrick, and the rest of the Gray 
family that has had to battle this hor-
rible loss.

INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
couldn’t be prouder of this House for 
passing the American Rescue Plan, an 
aggressive response to the pandemic, to 
pull us out of the doldrums in this 
country. 
As a result, millions and millions of 
Americans are back in jobs; millions 
and millions of American kids are back 
in schools; and so many people are vac-
cinated. We are back on the road to re-
covery. 
But we can’t stop there. We have in-
frastructure to address. I have been 
waiting for close to 10 years for us to 
pass an aggressive infrastructure pro-
gram. We have 7,500 miles of sub-
standard roads in Pennsylvania alone 
to fix. 
China is investing in itself: its roads, 
its bridges, its rail systems, its transit 
systems. What would make us think we 
don’t have to compete with China? 
What would make us think that our 
companies don’t need every advantage 
to compete on the world stage? 
Let’s get infrastructure done, and 
let’s do it boldly and aggressively to 
build up and invest in our own country. 
TAKE ACTION ON SOUTHERN 
BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, America’s southern border is 
in crisis, and this issue has been solely 
facilitated by the destructive policies 
of President Joe Biden. 
Illegal aliens attack the border, 
while dangerous drug cartels take ad-
vantage of weak policies, putting chil-
dren at risk. This is truly a disaster, 
and it is time that the border czar, 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS, take 
action to protect American families. 
The numbers speak for themselves. 
Encounters at the border reached a 21- 
year high in May of 180,034 persons. The 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
agency seized 934 pounds of fentanyl at 
the border in May, which is a 300 per-
cent increase in a year capable of kill-
ing every American citizen. Criminal 
crossings have almost tripled since the 
previous fiscal year to 6,918 convicted 
criminals. Drug trafficking and human 
smuggling have also increased, putting 
children’s lives in danger. 
Biden named the Vice President with 
overseeing the crisis. It has been 84 
days, and she still has not visited to 
see the children at risk. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we should never forget September 
the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Congratulations 
to 
Julianne 
and 
Hunter Wilson on the upcoming De-
cember blessed event.

EL PASO IS A 2021 ALL-AMERICA 
CITY 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, for the 
fourth time since 2010, the city of El 
Paso is honored to be named an All- 
America City for our resiliency, re-
sponse to tragedy, and vaccination ef-
forts against COVID–19 this year. 
The National Civic League awards 
the All-America City award to commu-
nities where residents, organizations, 
and government work together to ad-
dress challenges and improve quality of 
life. When President Biden announced 
his goal to vaccinate 70 percent of our 
Nation, El Paso not only met the goal 
a month early, but we have surpassed 
it and currently lead the country by 10 
percent. 
The All-America City award reaf-
firms our resiliency and outstanding 
civic accomplishments in the face of 
the tragic August 3 domestic terror at-
tack and the devastating COVID–19 
pandemic as well as our continued 
goodwill toward migrants seeking ref-
uge at our Nation’s front door. 
El Pasoans are no strangers to chal-
lenges, and our strength is tested over 
and over. Each time we grow stronger 
because we are and always will be El 
Paso Strong. 
It is an honor to represent this ex-
traordinary community here today, 
and I congratulate the city of El Paso.

INVESTIGATING COVID’S ORIGINS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address an incredibly 
important national security issue. 
We all know that Wuhan, China, 
where the COVID–19 virus originated, 
is the home to the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology. The WIV is China’s only cel-
lular level 4 biosafety super laboratory 
that researches human infectious dis-
eases. This lab is in very close prox-
imity to the wet market that is re-
puted to be the origin of COVID–19. 
Last year, Senator TOM COTTON was 
thoroughly dismissed for questioning 
the true origins of this virus, citing the 
Chinese Communist Party’s duplicity 
and dishonesty from the very begin-
ning. 
We all know that the Chinese Com-
munist Party lied to the world about 
the severity of COVID–19, how it is 
transmitted, and the dangers associ-
ated. There needs to be a thorough and 
serious investigation into the origins 
of COVID–19, what the Chinese Com-
munist Party knew, and when, and 
what the World Health Organization 
knew and when. 
Uncovering 
the 
true 
origins 
of 
COVID–19 will be incredibly helpful in 
helping us prepare for the next pan-
demic, which I think is something we 
can all agree on.

OPEN THE UNITED STATES- 
CANADA BORDER 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, it was recently announced 
that the European Union is lifting 
travel restrictions to allow Americans 
to visit once again. 
Over a year under the crush of a dev-
astating global pandemic, highly effec-
tive vaccines have made this game- 
changing moment possible. 
Still, our border between the United 
States and Canada remains closed, 
leaving people unable to access their 
property and keeping loved ones sepa-
rated 
for 
over 
15 
heartbreaking 
months. 
This move by the EU would allow my 
Buffalo neighbors to take a 9-hour 
flight to Paris, France, but they can’t 
take a 90-minute drive to Paris, On-
tario. 
The administration has set a goal of 
returning to a pre-pandemic sense of 
normalcy by July 4. For many living 
along the northern border, normalcy 
includes the ability to cross to check

CRISIS AT THE BORDER MUST BE 
ADDRESSED 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, earlier this 
year I had the opportunity to join with 
my other Republican colleagues to 
visit the southwest border. This was 
not a gesture, as the Vice President 
has referred to these visits. It was, in-
stead, a learning opportunity. 
The conditions we saw and the sto-
ries we heard conveyed a situation far 
worse than we had previously imag-
ined. We learned that border encoun-
ters are at a 20-year high. We spoke di-
rectly to Border Patrol and law en-
forcement officers who told us that 
they are so overwhelmed with the care 
of migrants that they are unable to 
execute essential core roles of their 
job. We learned how drug cartels are 
taking advantage of the overwhelmed 
system and saw the routes they use to 
smuggle drugs and people across the 
border. 
What we witnessed could only be de-
fined as a crisis. This is why I encour-
age all of my colleagues and the Vice 
President to set aside political games-
manship, visit the border, and see the 
crisis firsthand. 
f 
PROJECT ENLIGHTENMENT 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a pioneering institution in 
the field of early childhood education 
located in my district, Project Enlight-
enment. 
Project Enlightenment provides ex-
traordinary services to families and 
children, and I was privileged to visit 
with them last week. 
In the late 1960s, insightful staff from 
the Raleigh city schools, Wake County 
Mental Health and Dorothea Dix Child 
Psychiatry recognized that strength-
ening a child’s social and emotional de-
velopment in the early years would 
have long-term benefits. They were 
right, and the American Families Plan 
recognizes this fact. 
Project Enlightenment has offered 
prevention and early intervention serv-
ices to young children by providing 
services to the primary caregivers in 
their lives. Over the years, they have 
helped people all over the State of 
North Carolina and all over the coun-
try. 
I am grateful for the attentive staff 
that includes a variety of professionals. 
Because of their commitment to our 
children, they truly make our county 
and State a better place. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 
WINGATE UNIVERSITY BULLDOGS 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I chose this photo—I could 
have picked a formal team photo—be-
cause I thought this captured the joy 
of the moment I am bringing to the Na-
tion’s attention. 
Today, I rise to honor the Wingate 
University Bulldogs and Coach Jeff 
Gregory for a spectacular victory in 
the Division II College World Series. 
When Bulldogs fans filled the bleachers 
at the USA Baseball National Training 
Complex in Cary last Saturday, they 
witnessed history. Playing in their 
first ever College World Series final, 
the Wingate Bulldogs defeated Central 
Missouri, the number two ranked team 
in the Nation, 5–3. 
In 
reaching 
the 
championship, 
Wingate joined the ranks of only two 
other 
North 
Carolina 
Division 
II 
schools, and despite losing their open-
ing game, the Bulldogs won four 
straight to become the first team in 16 
years to overcome an opening round 
loss to win it all. 
Bulldogs, through your tenacity and 
persistence, you have won an incredible 
victory. I am proud today and always 
to represent Wingate University. 
Congratulations, Bulldogs.

REMEMBERING JERROD WITHROW 
(Mr. LAMB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, on June 11, 
2021, western Pennsylvania lost Officer 
Jerrod Withrow of the Mount Lebanon 
police, who passed away after a heroic 
battle with cancer. 
Officer Withrow had a long and dis-
tinguished career in law enforcement, 
but one moment stood out. In October 
2018, he responded to the Tree of Life 
Synagogue in Pittsburgh where a mass 
murderer attacked a peaceful religious 
gathering with an assault rifle and 
killed 11 members of our community. 
It is hard for most of us to under-
stand the bravery and the raw physical 
courage that it takes to run toward 
gunfire rather than away from it, but 
that was the kind of person that Offi-
cer Withrow was. It was who he trained 
himself to be, and we thank him and 
honor him for his courage. 
On behalf of the people of western 
Pennsylvania and on behalf of our na-
tional government, I wish to extend 
our condolences to Officer Withrow’s 
wife, Lisa; his sons: James, Brayden, 
and Ben; and all of his family. 
I am proud to remember Jerrod 
Withrow today in our Nation’s Capitol 
and hopeful that our service here will 
be worthy of all those Americans like 
him who every day put their commu-
nity and their country first. 
MICHIGAN SHERIFF OF THE YEAR 
KIM COLE 
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my friend, Sheriff Kim 
Cole of Mason County in Michigan. He 
was named Michigan Sheriffs’ Associa-
tion Sheriff of the Year this past week. 
This award recognizes the sheriff who 
has made outstanding contributions to 
law enforcement and the criminal jus-
tice profession, demonstrates excep-
tional service to their community, and 
has contributed to the betterment of 
the Michigan Sheriffs’ Association. 
Kim Cole was first elected sheriff in 
2012 and is currently serving in his 
third term. He started at the Mason 
County Sheriff’s Office as a reserve 
deputy, and then was hired by the 
Mason County Sheriff’s Office as a full- 
time deputy in 1985. He was then pro-
moted to sergeant in 1993. 
What is interesting, Mr. Speaker, is 
that Cole’s great-great grandfather, 
Henry Cole, served as one of Mason 
County’s first sheriffs. 
Now, Kim will be the first one to tell 
you that you are only as good as the 
people you surround yourself with, and 
he is extremely proud of all of those 
who he serves with. 
Kim leads with integrity, courage, 
fortitude, and compassion, and has a 
passion to serve his community. 
Kim Cole, I want to say thank you. 
Mason County is a better place to 
work, live, and raise a family because 
of you.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN HELPS 
FAMILIES 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the significant 
struggles 
facing 
working 
families 
across America, struggles that have 
been exposed and exacerbated by the 
COVID pandemic. 
That is why, through the American 
Rescue Plan, we took action to expand 
the child tax credit, helping to uplift 
families and reduce poverty. In my 
community, more than 40,000 house-
holds will receive an average benefit of 
nearly $3,000 that will begin being dis-
bursed in just a few short weeks. This 
is projected to lift 8,200 children out of 
poverty in my district alone. 
When we talk about transformative 
investment to support working fami-
lies, this is exactly what we mean, and 
it is why we need to make the ex-
panded child tax credit permanent, to 
put kids and parents on the path to 
success, because when we ease the fi-
nancial burden on families, they have 
the security and flexibility to con-
tribute to the workforce, strengthen 
our economy, and set our children up 
for a stable and successful future.

LIFESCAPE HELPS FAMILIES 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of efforts to build back our 
care economy. I recently toured a place 
called Lifescape in Rockford, Illinois, 
where I met a woman named Miss 
Selma. 
Miss Selma lives with her daughter 
and her granddaughter, and she has 
three 
generations 
under 
one 
roof. 
Three generations where she was the 
major caretaker for many years. 
About a decade ago she had a stroke, 
and so now her daughter has to take 
care of her. But she has to go to work 
also. So it is places like Lifescape that 
help families get back to work so they 
can make sure that their loved ones 
are cared for while they also make a 
living. 
The global pandemic put a spotlight 
on the need to invest in our care econ-
omy and places like Lifescape. Because 
of the CARES Act, Lifescape expanded 
their home meal delivery service by 800 
meals every single day and allowed for 
the care of people like Miss Selma. 
As we continue to negotiate an infra-
structure package, we need to invest in 
our care economy in order to get our 
national economy back in place.

THE TERRITORIES HEALTH 
EQUITY ACT 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3434, 
the Territories Health Equity Act of 
2021. 
This bill will address the existing in-
equalities the territories face under 
Medicaid, Medicare, and other Federal 
health programs. Importantly, regard-
ing Medicaid, it would provide us with 
the equitable share of Federal funding 
for Medicaid beyond the upcoming fis-
cal cliff when much of the existing 
funding for the territories is scheduled 
to expire at the end of September 2021. 
In the midst of a global pandemic, 
with more Federal attention on how 
healthcare funding disparities have had 
a deleterious impact on the finances of 
local 
governments 
and 
hospitals 
throughout the country, we believe 
this is an opportune time to press for 
equity in Medicaid and Medicare. 
The inequities in Federal funding 
provided to the territories for Medicaid 
and Medicare have put access to afford-
able healthcare out of reach for too 
many in the Virgin Islands and the 
other territories, making our hospitals’ 
emergency 
rooms 
the 
primary 
healthcare provider for one-third of our 
population without health insurance, 
which contributes to unmanageable 
costs. Please support H.R. 3434.

CONGRESS MUST INVEST IN AN 
INCLUSIVE CARE ECONOMY 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues to in-
vest in an inclusive care economy to 
help our families recover from the dev-
astating effects of this pandemic. 
As 
the 
price 
of 
childcare 
and 
eldercare increases, many mothers and 
women in my district had to leave the 
workforce. In a country like ours, this 
is totally unacceptable. Mothers are 
the backbone of our society and the 
pillar of my district. 
This is why, during our week of ac-
tion last week, I visited a childcare 
center run by a constituent in Deer 
Park servicing children with special 
needs; and I also visited an eldercare 
center in Pasadena, in my district. 
I witnessed firsthand the lifesaving, 
life-changing benefits out of an inclu-
sive care economy for our children and 
our seniors. 
Investing in an inclusive care econ-
omy could benefit my district and com-
munities of color that lack resources 
to overcome the impacts of this pan-
demic. 
Let’s invest in our most vulnerable 
with the American Families Plan. 
We can recover. ‘‘We can do it,’’ ‘‘Si 
se puede.’’

ESG DISCLOSURE SIMPLIFICATION 
ACT OF 2021 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 473, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 1187) to provide for disclosure 
of 
additional 
material 
information 
about public companies and establish a 
Sustainable Finance Advisory Com-
mittee, and for other purposes, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

TITLE IV—CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE 
SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Climate Risk 
Disclosure Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 402. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) climate change poses a significant and in-
creasing threat to the growth and stability of 
the economy of the United States; 
(2) many sectors of the economy of the United 
States and many American businesses are ex-
posed to climate-related risk, which may include 
exposure to— 
(A) the physical impacts of climate change, 
including the rise of the average global tempera-
ture, accelerating sea-level rise, desertification, 
ocean acidification, intensification of storms, in-
crease in heavy precipitation, more frequent and 
intense 
temperature 
extremes, 
more 
severe 
droughts, and longer wildfire seasons; 
(B) the economic disruptions and security 
threats that result from the physical impacts de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) including conflicts 
over scarce resources, conditions conducive to 
violent extremism, the spread of infectious dis-
eases, and forced migration; 
(C) the transition impacts that result as the 
global economy transitions to a clean and re-
newable energy, low-emissions economy, includ-
ing financial impacts as climate change fossil 
fuel assets becoming stranded and it becomes 
uneconomic for companies to develop fossil fuel 
assets as policymakers act to limit the worst im-
pacts of climate change by keeping the rise in 
average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius 
above pre-industrial levels; and 
(D) actions by Federal, State, Tribal, terri-
torial, and local governments to limit the worst 
effects of climate change by enacting policies 
that keep the global average surface tempera-
ture rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-indus-
trial levels; 
(3) assessing the potential impact of climate- 
related risks on national and international fi-
nancial systems is an urgent concern; 
(4) companies have a duty to disclose finan-
cial risks that climate change presents to their 
investors, lenders, and insurers; 
(5) the Securities and Exchange Commission 
has a duty to promote a risk-informed securities 
market that is worthy of the trust of the public 
as families invest for their futures; 
(6) investors, lenders, and insurers are in-
creasingly demanding climate risk information 
that is consistent, comparable, reliable, and 
clear; 
(7) including standardized, material climate 
change risk and opportunity disclosure that is 
useful for decision makers in annual reports to 
the Commission will increase transparency with 
respect to risk accumulation and exposure in fi-
nancial markets; 
(8) requiring companies to disclose climate-re-
lated risk exposure and risk management strate-
gies will encourage a smoother transition to a 
clean and renewable energy, low-emissions 
economy and guide capital allocation to miti-
gate, and adapt to, the effects of climate change 
and limit damages associated with climate-re-
lated events and disasters; and 
(9) a critical component in fighting climate 
change is a transparent accounting of the risks 
that climate change presents and the implica-
tions of continued inaction with respect to cli-
mate change.

‘‘(2) DISCLOSURE.—

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, is debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Financial Services. 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Member 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H.R. 1187 and to insert extra-
neous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1187, the Corporate Governance Im-
provement and Investor Protection 
Act. 
H.R. 1187 is a package of bills de-
signed to strengthen investor protec-
tions and require companies to provide 
environmental, social, and governance 
disclosures, known as ESG. I thank my 
colleague, 
Representative 
JUAN 
VARGAS, for his leadership on this 
package. 
This bill provides investors with crit-
ical information on ESG matters by re-
quiring public companies to disclose 
key information to shareholders re-
garding corporate political spending, 
worker pay, CEO compensation, cli-
mate risk, and country-by-country tax 
reporting; and provides issuers with 
clear, consistent standards to disclose 
this information. 
This is key information that inves-
tors have been demanding in order to 
make the best decisions on the short- 
and long-term viability of the compa-
nies they are investing in. 
It is surprising that, to this day, 
there are no explicit ESG requirements 
and investors are left to piece together 
the story of a company’s material risk 
with insufficient information. This is 
unacceptable. 
So I am pleased that this package of 
bills will improve investor protections 
by holding public companies account-
able 
and 
providing 
greater 
trans-
parency. 
This package includes a number of 
bills authored by several hardworking 
members of the Financial Services 
Committee, specifically: Representa-
tive JUAN VARGAS, Representative BILL 
FOSTER, Representative Nydia Velaz-
quez, Representative SEAN CASTEN, and 
Representative CINDY AXNE. 
Specifically, Mr. VARGAS’ bill, the 
ESG Disclosure Simplification Act, re-
quires public companies to disclose cer-
tain ESG information to shareholders, 
as well as the impact of the ESG poli-
cies on their strategies. 
Mr. FOSTER’s bill, the Shareholder 
Political Transparency Act, requires 
public companies to submit quarterly 
reports to the SEC on any and all polit-
ical 
expenditures, 
including 
dark 
money. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ’s bill, the Greater Ac-
countability in Pay Act, sheds light on 
pay disparities, helping to close the 
gender and racial pay gap. 
Ms. AXNE’s bill, the Disclosure of Tax 
Havens and Offshoring Act, requires 
disclosures that discourage companies’

use of tax havens and encourages repa-
triation of taxes to the United States. 
Mr. CASTEN’s bill, the Climate Risk 
Disclosure Act, requires disclosures 
that encourages companies to plan for 
the impact of climate change on their 
company. 
Each of these bills passed the Finan-
cial Services Committee with unani-
mous Democratic support. I thank all 
these Members for their work on these 
bills, their contributions to the legisla-
tive package, and their leadership on 
these important reforms to protect in-
vestors and hold corporations account-
able. 
This package is the right thing to do 
for investors and our markets. It is 
past time that Congress make ESG re-
quirements explicit. For these reasons, 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am opposed to this bill, and I rise in 
opposition to H.R. 1187. 
Mr. Speaker, today, my Democrat 
colleagues, once again, are seeking to 
hijack our securities laws to push left-
wing political and social agendas, de-
spite dressing it up as investor protec-
tion. 
Make no mistake, this bill will in-
crease costs on publicly owned compa-
nies, 
discourage 
private 
companies 
from going public; and, frankly, could 
encourage not only private companies 
to stay private, but even have and en-
tice public companies to go back to 
being private companies. 
This is going to result in fewer in-
vestment opportunities for everyday 
American investors, also known as our 
constituents, who are saving for retire-
ment, a college education or simply 
looking to just build a better life. 
In short, this bill will increase the 
number of government-directed, man-
datory disclosure requirements on pub-
licly traded companies, which will in-
crease compliance costs on companies 
and divert company resources that 
could have been used to create more 
jobs. 
Now, to be fair, this is a job-creation 
bill. However, the only jobs created by 
this bill will be for a special tranche of 
attorneys, corporate compliance coor-
dinators, and the occasional scientist; 
not exactly what an economist would 
call productive-types of jobs. 
Under this bill, public companies 
would be required to disclose: 
Environmental, social, and govern-
ance issues, as well as climate risk. 
These metrics would be set by the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission, not 
Congress; 
Descriptions of any expenditure for 
political activities and donations to 
political candidates or trade organiza-
tions by executives, these are duplica-
tive of existing requirements, for ex-
ample; 
The ratio between the pay raise per-
centage of the company’s executives 
and the pay raise percentage of the 
company’s median employee. This is, 
in some ways, duplicative of the man-
datory CEO pay ratio disclosure that 
Democrats put into the Dodd-Frank 
Act, which itself is an especially use-
less metric; country-by-country tax 
and 
financial 
reports 
from 
multi-
national enterprises. This will upend 
the current country-by-country tax re-
porting rules overseen by the IRS. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear. My 
friends across the aisle are using the 
Federal securities laws to implement 
their partisan wish list of social policy 
priorities. They are doing it through 
mandatory disclosure regimes that are, 
at best, tangentially related to actual 
investment decisions. 
To be clear, if information presents a 
material investment risk to a publicly 
traded company, the company is—wait 
for this—already required to disclose 
it. That information is out there for 
those companies that have material 
risk. 
Materiality has been, and continues 
to be, the touchstone of our public 
company disclosure regime for more 
than eight decades and has actually 
even been affirmed by the U.S. Su-
preme Court. It has held the test of 
time, and we simply cannot just dis-
card it to appeal to the Democrats’ 
progressive agenda. 
Our capital markets are the best in 
the world in no small part because ma-
teriality is the basis of our disclosure 
regime here in the United States, yet 
my Democrat friends, apparently, want 
to throw it all away for the sake of ap-
pealing to leftwing stakeholders. 
Additionally, H.R. 1187 will greatly 
expand the SEC’s jurisdiction by re-
quiring the SEC to promulgate disclo-
sures 
on 
environmental, 
climate 
change, political spending, tax report-
ing, and foreign policy issues, among 
others. 
This is not the sweet spot for the 
SEC. It does not have the experience in 
any of these issues, and is not the ap-
propriate entity for determining these 
metrics or industry standards, nor is 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion the appropriate entity to review 
and enforce such disclosures. 
The SEC knows how to regulate ma-
teriality. That is their expertise. They 
are not climatologists or climate sci-
entists. They are not election law ex-
perts. And they most certainly do not 
know international tax law. That is 
the purview of the EPA, NOAA, the 
FEC, and the IRS. 
Furthermore, smaller public compa-
nies will bear the burden of additional 
compliance costs. This bill fails to ac-
count for the impact it will have on 
smaller businesses and companies, es-
pecially those who are looking to go 
public. Or maybe I should say, were 
looking to go public. They certainly do 
not have the infrastructure or re-
sources to spend on fixed costs of com-
pliance like this. 
H.R. 1187 will result in fewer invest-
ment opportunities for American inves-
tors. It will discourage private compa-
nies from going public and encourage 
public companies to go private to avoid 
these burdensome new nonmaterial and 
useless disclosure requirements. 
Sadly, this will hurt the everyday in-
vestors, our constituents, that the 
Democrats claim they want to help. In 
other words, this bill stands to harm 
everyone saving for retirement, a col-
lege education, or just looking to build 
a better life. 
This is just a bad bill, and I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on H.R. 1187. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1245 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. VARGAS), our leader and the 
real sponsor on this legislation. 
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support the Corporate Govern-
ance Improvement and Investor Pro-
tection 
Act. 
I 
particularly 
thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for her support of 
the environmental, social, and govern-
ance metrics. Her efforts have been he-
roic, and I appreciate it very, very 
much. 
Mr. Speaker, when we talk about in-
vestors, we are not only talking about 
large, wealthy institutions. We are 
talking about teachers. We are talking 
about people who are working hard for 
their money. We are also talking about 
nonprofessional investors who have 
found in the stock market a way to 
build their savings toward, for exam-
ple, homeownership, college tuition, 
and retirement. When we are talking 
about investors, we are also talking 
about pension funds that hold many 
hardworking 
Americans’ 
retirement 
savings. 
When a company engages in practices 
that put its business at risk, it also 
risks the funds these investors have en-
trusted with it. 
That is why the SEC requires public 
companies to disclose material infor-
mation, meaning information that a 
reasonable investor needs in order to 
make a voting decision or decide 
whether to continue investing in that 
company. Mandated and standard dis-
closures of environmental, social, and 
governance, or ESG, metrics would 
provide improved insight into long- 
term business performance and areas of 
potential future risks. 
These metrics are material to inves-
tors and central to their protection. 
Together, I and my colleagues have 
worked to write legislation that would 
ensure such protection. My bill—the 
first in the package—requires the SEC 
to mandate standard ESG disclosures. 
My colleagues’ bills require reporting 
on specific ESG metrics that investors 
have been advocating for over many 
years. I applaud Representatives FOS-
TER, VELAZQUEZ, CASTEN, and AXNE for 
their legislation. 
Additionally, I thank Chair Gensler 
for his advocacy that investors’ voices 
are central to materiality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2836 
June 16, 2021 
I have to say, climate change is real, 
and we have to take it seriously. It is 
not a Member of this House or the 
other House taking a snowball, throw-
ing it, and saying: See, there is no cli-
mate change. 
Climate change is real. Look at what 
happened in Texas this summer. They 
were begging for energy because they 
were not prepared because of climate 
change. They were melting snow in 
their bathtubs so they could flush their 
toilets. 
If you take a look at what is hap-
pening out in the West today: drought, 
the unfortunate reality that we face 
the risk of catastrophic fires. 
All of this is climate change, and it is 
about time that we take this very, very 
seriously as a country. 
Some companies already do this. 
They already disclose the ESG metrics. 
That is why it is important to have an 
equal playing field where all companies 
disclose. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman WATERS 
for her heroic efforts here. I also thank 
my colleagues. 
I urge my colleagues on the other 
side: Take climate change for real. Ac-
cept that it is happening. It is real, and 
it is catastrophic. And we must take it 
seriously. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL), a leader on this 
issue. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member HUIZENGA
for the 
time on the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I would say to my 
friends on the other side of the aisle: 
We are not debating climate change 
here. We are debating the proper way 
to financially disclose risks on finan-
cial statements of companies that may 
or may not experience impact from cli-
mate change. 
No one is over here denying about 
climate. We are here talking about 
what the right way is to do this. And 
H.R. 1187 is not the right way to do cli-
mate disclosure on behalf of taxpayers, 
shareholders, and employees of public 
companies. 
I have spent the better part of four 
decades in leadership in both public 
and private companies, and I have been 
engaged throughout those years in 
calling for quality corporate govern-
ance practices. I can say with absolute 
authority that mandating these disclo-
sures as outlined in H.R. 1187 is not 
only not necessary but would be expen-
sive and lead to increased litigation 
costs. 
As my colleagues have already said, 
the information is already to be dis-
closed if it meets the materiality 
standard. The idea of materiality has 
been refined over many decades, and it 
is what makes our capital markets the 
envy of the world. 
As Justice Marshall stated in the Su-
preme Court opinion from 1976: ‘‘Some 
information is of such dubious signifi-
cance that insistence on its disclosure 
may accomplish more harm than good. 
. . . If the standard of materiality is 
unnecessarily low . . . management’s 
fear of exposing itself to substantial li-
ability may cause it simply to bury the 
shareholders in an avalanche of trivial 
information, a result that is hardly 
conducive 
to 
informed 
decision-
making.’’ 
We articulated this in a letter to the 
SEC that my colleagues and I sent re-
garding their plans for financial disclo-
sure. In that letter, signed by 22 of my 
Republican colleagues in the House, we 
outline our concerns about the SEC 
going far afield of its statutory mission 
to protect investors; maintain fair, or-
derly, and efficient markets; and facili-
tate capital formation. 
We also warn that the nature and 
scope of climate change disclosure 
rightfully depends on a particular com-
pany’s business line and their carbon 
footprint. 
One-size-fits-all, 
uniform 
mandates would be deeply misguided 
for an issue as complex as the impact 
of the climate over many, many years 
on individual businesses. 
This rings more true here in Con-
gress. Congress does not know what is 
best for a public company. These deci-
sions are best left up to the board that 
already has a fiduciary obligation to 
its shareholders to manage this kind of 
issue. 
Our publicly traded companies are re-
sponsive to shareholder engagement. 
Over the last two decades, they have 
dramatically improved their govern-
ance practices by increasing diverse, 
independent directors and increasing 
their boards’ attention to the business 
judgment rule and fiduciary duty of 
care. 
Look at Procter & Gamble as just 
one U.S. iconic company. In 2000, their 
annual proxy statement was 56 pages. 
Today, it is 111 pages. 
Like the vast majority of public com-
panies in the S&P 500, P&G has signifi-
cant disclosures of ESG initiatives, 
their political contributions, and their 
sales around the world. 
Let’s not make it more difficult for 
public companies. As policymakers, we 
should be promoting policies that bol-
ster investment options for Americans, 
not limit them. This bill limits that. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote against the legislation. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. CASTEN). 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my legislation, the Climate 
Risk Disclosure Act, H.R. 1187. 
I would like us all to imagine for a 
moment that you had all of your 
wealth tied up in a single company, 
and you knew that that company was 
on track to lose nearly 20 percent of its 
value thanks to a known and avoidable 
threat. You call the CEO, and the CEO 
responded by saying: We have it taken 
care of, but I am not going to explain 
how. 
That is the reality that the climate 
crisis is creating for our global econ-
omy. 
Swiss Re recently found that global 
GDP will decrease by 4 percent if we 
meet the Paris climate accords, and if 
we stay with business as usual, 18 per-
cent. 
Domestically, the CFTC has come to 
roughly the same conclusion, esti-
mating that for every 1 degree Celsius 
rise in temperature, we can expect a 1.2 
percent 
reduction 
in 
annual 
GDP 
growth. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends that 
that is material. It is a big deal. 
Those economic losses are due to the 
wildfires, 
droughts, 
blackouts, 
and 
superstorms that have already caused 
$500 billion of damages in the past 4 
years, and investors understand this. 
The fossil fuel industry has spent 10 
years slashing prices. And do you know 
what? They are still losing market 
share to lower-cost renewables and effi-
ciency. 
ExxonMobil didn’t write down $20 bil-
lion because they are woke. They wrote 
down $20 billion because the free mar-
ket is beating them. 
Investors want to know how to re-
allocate their capital in response to 
that risk. They want to know how to 
allocate it to more productive uses. 
That is why there were over 140 cli-
mate-related shareholder proposals at 
U.S. companies during the 2020 proxy 
season. But we, in this body, have not 
done our job to protect those investors. 
Let us be very clear. When we talk 
about investor protection, every com-
pany in the world would like to have 
asymmetry of information. Our job is 
to make sure that if you love free mar-
kets as much as I do, as much as those 
of us on this side of the aisle do, then 
you have to make sure that they have 
full transparency of information. Right 
now, public companies have no obliga-
tion to disclose their exposure to cli-
mate-related risks, nor is there a con-
sistent format for those disclosures. 
This bill would fix that. 
It directs the SEC to issue a rule re-
quiring every public company to dis-
close its direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas emissions, the total amount of fos-
sil fuel-related assets that it owns or 
manages, how its valuation would be 
affected if climate change continues at 
its current pace or if policymakers suc-
cessfully restrict greenhouse gas emis-
sions to meet the Paris goals, and its 
risk management strategies related to 
the physical and transitional risks of 
the climate crisis. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
reassure my friend from Arkansas that 
the bill does direct the SEC to tailor 
those disclosure requirements to dif-
ferent industries to make sure that the 
burden is borne most heavily by those 
companies with the greatest contribu-
tion to that risk. 
When it comes to making this transi-
tion, markets are some of the most

powerful tools we have, but efficient 
markets depend on transparent infor-
mation. It is on us to provide that effi-
ciency, to unleash the power of our en-
trepreneurs and our capitalists to cre-
ate jobs and economic growth, and to 
leave a better planet than the one we 
inherited—but only if we act. 
This is a win for capitalism, a win for 
consumers, and a win for the planet 
that we will pass on to our grand-
children. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in support of this legislation. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), who has been an out-
standing voice on these particular 
issues. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Michigan. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1187, with all due respect 
to my good friends from California and 
Illinois. We have enjoyed a robust dis-
cussion and debate on this, which I 
would argue is a very important topic. 
Mr. Speaker, the statutory mission 
of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission is to protect investors; main-
tain fair, orderly, and efficient mar-
kets; and facilitate capital formation. 
Its mission, though, is not to reduce 
carbon emissions. Its mission is not to 
solve climate change. 
Now, those may be laudable public 
policy objectives, but they are best 
handled by the Congress or other Fed-
eral agencies. This is simply not the 
job of the SEC. 
This bill is, unfortunately, the next 
episode in the Democrats’ saga to 
weaponize 
financial 
regulation 
to 
achieve partisan social and environ-
mental goals. Congressional Democrats 
and the Biden administration know 
that they cannot pass the Green New 
Deal and other extreme far-left policy 
priorities through a Democrat-major-
ity Congress, so they are corrupting an 
independent Federal financial regu-
lator to do their bidding. 
The majority claims that this bill is 
an effort to improve corporate govern-
ance when, in reality, it is a thinly 
veiled attempt to open a back door to 
achieve their socialist wish list and cut 
off financing to legal but politically 
unfashionable industries that they de-
spise. 
The result will be higher energy costs 
for the American people, a regressive 
energy tax on the people in this coun-
try who can the least afford it. 
As always, the Democrats think that 
the government knows best and is bet-
ter equipped than the private market 
to meet demand. They give no consid-
eration to the impacts of significant 
cost increases, the bill’s effect on retail 
investors, or the actual utility of the 
information they are requesting and its 
materiality for informing investment 
decisions. 
My friend from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) 
made this point. But the seminal Su-
preme Court case that defines the ma-
teriality standard was TSC Industries 
v. Northway. In that majority opinion, 
Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote, and 
it bears repeating: ‘‘If the standard of 
materiality is unnecessarily low, not 
only may the corporation and its man-
agement be subjected to liability for 
insignificant 
omissions 
or 
misstatements, but also management’s 
fear of exposing itself to substantial li-
ability may cause it simply to bury the 
shareholders in an avalanche of trivial 
information, a result that is hardly 
conducive 
to 
informed 
decision-
making.’’ 
So, this is not about investor protec-
tion. This is about weaponizing Federal 
securities law to discriminate against 
law-abiding American energy compa-
nies. This is an effort to pick winners 
and losers in the marketplace by the 
government. It is an effort for central 
planning of our economy. It is not 
about markets. This is about market 
distortion by the Federal Government. 
In committee, I tried to make a com-
monsense change to ensure the bill 
covers only material information so 
that investors aren’t buried by that av-
alanche. The majority rejected my 
amendment. This shows they are more 
interested in naming and shaming com-
panies than providing useful informa-
tion to investors. 
b 1300 
Mr. Speaker, my last point is this: 
the job of the SEC is to protect inves-
tors, but this bill would compromise 
investor returns by elevating nonpecu-
niary factors above and ahead of finan-
cial performance. 
How do we know this? Because fees of 
ESG funds are 43 percent higher than 
non-ESG funds. And many low-ranked 
ESG stocks not only outperformed top- 
ranked ESG stocks, they outperformed 
the market overall. 
We must not harm American inves-
tors. We must not harm American re-
tirement savers by subordinating in-
vestor returns to promote nonpecu-
niary policy objectives like social jus-
tice, diversity quotas, and lower carbon 
emissions. 
Financial regulations should not be a 
tool for social change. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. AXNE). 
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for putting to-
gether such an important set of cor-
porate governance reforms, one that 
absolutely supports investors in this 
country, like our teachers who are in-
volved in institutional investment for 
their safety and a dignified retirement. 
Mr. Speaker, this package will abso-
lutely give everyone more information 
about how companies are investing for 
the long term, and that includes my 
bill, the Disclosure of Tax Havens and 
Offshoring Act. 
Last year, 55 profitable U.S. corpora-
tions paid no Federal corporate income 
taxes. Let me repeat that. Last year, 55 
profitable U.S. corporations paid no 
corporate income taxes—I can tell you, 
that is not what happened on Main 
Street back in my district in Iowa. 
They paid their taxes—and many more 
paid far below the statutory rate of 21 
percent. 
It is not hard to see why this hap-
pens. 
In 
2018, 
U.S. 
multinationals 
booked hundreds of billions of dollars 
of tax havens where they basically paid 
no taxes, including $100 billion alone in 
Bermuda. 
This costs the U.S. more than $50 bil-
lion per year in taxes. And beyond the 
damage that that does, which is exten-
sive, it hurts all of the businesses who 
are doing the right thing, those that 
are on Main Street in all of our com-
munities, including many small busi-
nesses across this country who don’t 
have a subsidiary in Barbados just to 
avoid taxes. 
That is why last weekend, seven of 
the world’s largest economies agreed to 
end the race to the bottom and require 
a global minimum tax rate of 15 per-
cent for our corporations. That is going 
to have a big impact on the corpora-
tions who have been using tax havens, 
but the investors and the public don’t 
know which corporations are using 
these loopholes and where they are 
booking their profits. 
My bill will fix that, by requiring dis-
closure of very basic information about 
a company’s operations on a country- 
by-country basis, including revenue, 
profit, taxes paid, and number of em-
ployees they have. This would take in-
formation large multinational corpora-
tions already have and give us much– 
needed transparency into the inter-
national tax avoidance strategies com-
panies use if they are shipping jobs 
overseas. It gives us the information 
that we need, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following let-
ters, a June 14 letter from the National 
Association of Manufacturers, a June 
15 letter from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, and a June 16 letter from 
the American Securities Association, 
all in opposition to this bill. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
MANUFACTURERS, 
June 14, 2021 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
National Association of Manufacturers, I 
write to express opposition to H.R. 1187, the 
Corporate Governance Improvement and In-
vestor Protection Act. 
Manufacturers are taking the lead in inno-
vating solutions to climate change, ensuring 
clean air and water, and enhancing diversity 
and inclusion—and, importantly, in pro-
viding information about this critical work 
to their investors. Public company reporting 
related to climate change and other environ-
mental, social, and governance topics should 
allow for principles-based disclosure of finan-
cially material information relevant to these 
efforts. The NAM is concerned that the ESG 
Disclosure Simplification Act, the Share-
holder 
Political 
Transparency 
Act, 
the 
Greater Accountability in Pay Act, and the 
Climate Risk Disclosure Act would impose 
disclosure mandates that focus on costly 
one-size-fits-all metrics rather than mate-
rial, decision-useful information for inves-
tors.

Similarly, the Disclosure of Tax Havens 
and Offshoring Act would impose a signifi-
cant compliance burden—while also risking 
exposure of valuable and proprietary data— 
by requiring public reporting of country-by- 
country tax information by U.S. companies. 
The United States’ support for Action 13 of 
the OECD/G20’s BEPS country-by-country 
reporting initiative was based on the re-
quirement that these reports, which are ex-
changed between the IRS and other tax au-
thorities, would remain confidential. 
The NAM is engaging with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission as it considers 
ways to enhance the comparability of cli-
mate and ESG information disclosed by pub-
licly traded companies. Manufacturers are 
hopeful that any new climate or ESG report-
ing framework will be flexible, principles- 
based, and materiality-driven while pro-
viding clarity to publicly traded companies 
and supporting their efforts to furnish mate-
rial information to investors in a com-
parable manner. We encourage Congress to 
provide appropriate oversight of the SEC’s 
ongoing work without mandating a one-size- 
fits-all approach. 
Sincerely, 
CHRIS NETRAM, 
Vice President, Tax and 
Domestic Economic Policy. 
U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, June 15, 2021. 
TO
THE MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. HOUSE
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: The U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce strongly opposes H.R. 1187, the 
‘‘Corporate Governance Improvement and In-
vestor Protection Act.’’ While some of the 
underlying goals of H.R. 1187 are laudable, 
the bill would likely result in significant 
costs for Main Street investors and it would 
fail to achieve its stated objectives. The 
Chamber will consider including votes on 
this legislation in our ‘‘How They Voted’’ 
scorecard. 
Over the last several years, the Chamber 
has worked closely with stakeholders to pro-
mote a corporate disclosure framework for 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
factors. This framework acknowledges the 
inherently complex nature of these issues 
and allows companies to disclose industry 
specific information. We believe this ap-
proach would help ensure investors receive 
material, decision-useful information while 
eliminating the cost of burdensome and im-
practical mandates. 
By contrast, H.R. 1187 would result in an 
unworkable, one-size-fits-all disclosure re-
gime for public companies on ESG issues in-
cluding climate change, executive compensa-
tion, and pay practices. This misguided ap-
proach would impose enormous compliance 
costs on public companies. It would be espe-
cially harmful to small issuers and emerging 
growth companies (EGCs) without the same 
compliance resources as large companies. 
H.R. 1187 would create yet another barrier to 
going public in the United States, thus re-
moving opportunities for retail investors to 
build wealth and contribute to the economy. 
Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s land-
mark decision on materiality in 1976 (TSC 
Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.), compa-
nies today are already required to disclose 
material information related to climate 
change and ESG. H.R. 1187 could veer away 
from this traditional standard for disclosure 
that has served as a centerpiece of America’s 
well-functioning capital markets for dec-
ades. In that decision, the Court rejected the 
idea that a fact is material if it ‘‘might’’ be 
important to an investor, and explained that 
in formulating a materiality standard, it 
sought to avoid a scenario in which investors 
would be overwhelmed ‘‘in an avalanche of 
trivial information—a result that is hardly 
conducive to informed decision making.’’ 
This legislation is incompatible with Justice 
Marshall’s opinion on materiality—a stand-
ard that is recognized by SEC Chair Gary 
Gensler. 
In addition, the Chamber has supported 
previous versions of legislation introduced 
by Representative Gregory Meeks on disclo-
sure of corporate board diversity, which have 
garnered bipartisan support. The Chamber 
believes this legislation should be considered 
separately. It is regrettable that Representa-
tive Meek’s thoughtful legislation has been 
included in this flawed H.R. 1187. 
The Chamber opposes H.R. 1187, the ‘‘Cor-
porate Governance Improvement and Inves-
tor Protection Act,’’ and urges you to vote 
against this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
JACK HOWARD. 
AMERICAN SECURITIES ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, June 16, 2021. 
Re H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance Im-
provement and Investor Protection Act 
of 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER MCCARTHY, 
AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVES: The American Securities Association 
(ASA) provides this letter regarding H.R. 
1187, the ‘‘Corporate Governance Improve-
ment and Investor Protection Act of 2021,’’ 
which is scheduled to be considered by the 
House of Representatives this week. For 
multiple reasons set forth below, ASA must 
oppose H.R. 1187 and we urge members to 
vote against the bill. 
POLITICAL SPENDING 
H.R. 1187 includes a section that would 
force corporations to disclose their political 
activities. Moving forward with a policy in-
tended to stifle protected speech suggests 
this bill is less about providing investors 
with useful information, and more about si-
lencing political opponents. Enacting poli-
cies to erect barriers for companies to en-
gage in the political process on policy issues 
that are fundamental to their business vio-
lates the First Amendment. 
The ASA strongly opposes this legislation. 
Given that companies are already required 
to disclose their political contributions and 
lobbying activity, we fail to see what value 
duplicative regulation in this instance would 
add. We also question how the information 
required by this bill could possibly meet the 
test of ‘‘materiality’’ when comparing the 
actual dollar amounts associated with a pub-
lic company’s political activities to the total 
revenue of the company. 
We note that a study found the market’s 
perception of a company’s value based on its 
stock prices is not related to a corporation’s 
decision to either engage in or refrain from 
corporate political speech. Shareholders of 
public companies also seem to understand 
this as large majorities have consistently re-
jected activist shareholder proposals in this 
area. In short, the owners of the company do 
not believe management’s political spending 
impacts a company’s value or its financial 
performance. While these facts may be in-
convenient, they should not be dismissed 
lightly. 
As important, this section of the bill seems 
to run afoul of the First Amendment because 
some provisions could have a chilling effect 
on free speech. Certain politicians have al-
ready made it clear that this disclosure will 
be used to target companies who engage in 
the political process or choose to support 
certain organizations. This would allow the 
securities laws to be used as a public rela-
tions tool to silence political opposition. 
Congress should respect the First Amend-
ment rights of all Americans and vote this 
bill down. 
IMPROVING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE THROUGH 
DIVERSITY AMENDMENT 
The ASA appreciates that Congress will be 
considering, as an amendment to H.R. 1187, 
this bipartisan legislation to inform inves-
tors about the diversity of public company 
directors. ASA members have long recog-
nized the benefits of workforce inclusion and 
have taken actionable steps to hire and train 
individuals of all backgrounds. The boards 
and workforce of ASA members reflect this 
view. We believe the best way to build a sus-
tainable economy is though inclusion. 
While ASA supports the Improving Cor-
porate Governance Through Diversity Act, 
in April we recommended a number of 
changes to strengthen the bill prior to its 
markup by the Financial Services Com-
mittee. We continue to believe the diversity 
criteria should be expanded to include indi-
viduals of diverse viewpoints and diverse 
professional/educational backgrounds. The 
inclusion of individuals of different genders, 
races, ethnicities, viewpoints, and experi-
ences is necessary to achieve the policy goals 
Congress rightly seeks to achieve. 
Congress should refrain from adopting poli-
cies that would promote boards composed of 
a club of individuals whose experience tracks 
a certain managerial/educational path or re-
quires adherence to a particular point of 
view. Today, more than ever, public compa-
nies need the benefit of hearing from individ-
uals with different experiences who will 
question and engage with executives about 
the appropriate direction and decision-mak-
ing of public companies. Unfortunately, 
changes to reflect this important priority 
have not been made to the underlying legis-
lation. 
REP. HILL AMENDMENT—SEC STUDY 
The ASA supports the approach taken by 
Representative 
Hill’s 
amendment, 
which 
would require the SEC to study the incon-
sistencies and differences between ESG re-
porting frameworks prior to mandating new 
disclosures for public companies. 
To date, the SEC has failed to conduct 
such a study. As a result, the Commission 
has no way to know how current ESG disclo-
sure practices already inform investors, or 
what specific areas could be improved upon 
to ensure companies only disclose material 
information. This study would lead to a 
more targeted approach that would mitigate 
unnecessary compliance costs and protect in-
vestors from unworkable mandates. 
MANDATORY ESG DISCLOSURES 
The ASA letter to the Financial Services 
Committee in April outlined a number of 
recommendations and concerns we had with 
a series of ESG-related bills that were 
marked up by the Committee. Unfortu-
nately, none of those concerns or questions 
have been answered. 
In that letter, we noted the following: 
ESG disclosure mandates would create an 
unequal and unfair playing field for Amer-
ican businesses vis-a`-vis Chinese companies; 
Businesses 
would 
spend 
an 
enormous 
amount of time and resources reorienting 
their compliance systems to comply with 
ESG mandates at a time when policymakers 
should want companies to be focused on hir-
ing to help the American economy recover; 
Company management should be permitted 
to determine what is ‘material’ to its busi-
ness using its own business judgment—just 
as management is now permitted to do for 
other risks that companies face;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2839 
June 16, 2021 
Judgements about material disclosure can 
be challenged by investors or the SEC in 
court, which provides an important check 
that incentivizes companies to provide accu-
rate and full disclosure. This process is not 
broken, and we see no reason to change it in 
this instance; 
The costs of one-size-fits-all disclosure 
cannot be justified; 
The beneficiaries of a prescriptive one-size- 
fits-all ESG disclosure regime would be an 
entrenched professional class on Wall Street 
of well-heeled corporate attorneys, auditors, 
mega-asset managers, proxy advisors, index 
providers, standard setters and investment 
banks. This begs the question: why is Con-
gress using climate change as a reason to 
adopt policies that will transfer money from 
the public companies owned by America’s 
mom-and-pop investors directly to the Wall 
Street-industrial-complex? Retirees, work-
ing families, and those investing for a better 
future should have an answer to that ques-
tion before the bill moves forward; 
The bill imposes a significant cost burden 
on small companies and undermines capital 
formation, which is one part of the SEC’s 
three-part mission. Imposing these costs on 
small, emerging growth, and mid-sized com-
panies will only serve to further entrench 
the large and mega-cap companies in our 
markets who can easily absorb them. We 
question why Congress would adopt a policy 
that tips the scales in favor of the same com-
panies that many in this body believe are 
using their market power to harm consumers 
and distort our political economy; and 
An unintended loophole will exempt Chi-
nese companies in indexes from this disclo-
sure. This will unfairly disadvantage Amer-
ican companies and deprive mom-and-pop in-
vestors of disclosure about Communist Chi-
na’s emission of greenhouse gases, or wheth-
er any CCP-controlled Chinese company is 
involved in commission of crimes against hu-
manity and genocide that Congress. 
CONCLUSION 
While ASA opposes this bill, we will con-
tinue to engage with members and the SEC 
to preserve our current disclosure system 
which ensures investors are provided with 
material information, including information 
that falls into the bucket of ESG. H.R. 1187 
frustrates this goal, and therefore, we urge 
members to oppose it. 
Sincerely, 
CHRISTOPHER A. IACOVELLA, 
Chief Executive Officer, 
American Securities Association. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DONALDS), who is a new Mem-
ber to this House Chamber and an out-
standing Member. 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, full dis-
closure, I actually do not sit on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee, but my 
career has actually been in financial 
services. I spent the last 17 years of my 
life working in banking, insurance, and 
financial services. 
I understand the importance of pro-
tecting investors and ensuring fairness 
in the market, which is part of the mis-
sion of the SEC. In fact, it was so im-
portant to me that during my time in 
the Florida legislature, I introduced 
legislation that was designed to pro-
tect vulnerable investors, and that leg-
islation has actually become law in the 
State of Florida. 
H.R. 1187 is inconsistent with the 
mission of the SEC. It does not protect 
investors; it is not fair or efficient. It 
is the exact opposite. It is nothing 
more than a government-run litmus 
test that politicizes the SEC and con-
tradicts the very important mission of 
the SEC. 
Mandating public companies to dis-
close details that are not financially 
relevant or material is an abuse of 
power. Not to mention, we see compa-
nies who are willing to disclose this in-
formation on their own, and they are 
taking steps to address some of the 
issues that my friends on the other side 
of the aisle might want to mandate. 
Just the other day, Ralph Lauren came 
out and they said they were going to 
publicly disclose this information. It is 
good for them to do, if they choose to 
do so, but this puts companies in a po-
sition to compete for capital based off 
of virtue signaling rather than the 
metrics that are relevant in capital 
markets. 
I ask my friends on the other side of 
the aisle: How does this move the nee-
dle for everyday Americans? Does dis-
closing diversity quotas and carbon 
emissions impacts, does that promote 
efficiency in the market? I know it 
does not. And it also doesn’t promote 
capital formation in these markets. 
This mandate only promotes what we 
have seen from this Congress and the 
administration, an out-of-touch and 
misguided political agenda. This is 
nothing more than liberal fascism, yet 
another way to push a social agenda in 
our capital markets. This bill will es-
sentially create good companies and 
bad companies, and have their future 
be based off the opinions of the mob 
and not their business success. 
Just last year, we saw a company 
like Goya Foods come under fire for its 
president’s affiliation with the Repub-
lican Party. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, the at-
tempt to cancel Goya Foods failed, but 
it exposed the underbelly of the left’s 
attempt to coerce companies into 
bending the knee to the extremists in 
the court of public opinion. 
In short, Mr. Speaker, this is a bad 
bill. It does not promote efficient mar-
kets, it destroys them. And it sends our 
financial markets into a place where 
we should not go in the United States 
of America. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES). 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues, Mr. VARGAS
and Chair-
woman WATERS, for leading on these 
important issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill and my amendment that we will be 
considering later today. 
My colleague from Florida just ac-
cused us of being out of touch. I wonder 
if he remembers that 2 weeks ago the 
Nation was out of gas. We were out of 
gas because of a successful cyberattack 
on Colonial Pipeline. And it is a daily 
thing, JBS Foods, ferry services, met-
ropolitan transit authority, and the 
list goes on and on and on and on. So 
we were out of gas, not out of touch. 
And my amendment is simple, it just 
requires a straightforward, relatively 
moderate, disclosure of corporations. 
Do you have a board member that un-
derstands cybersecurity? And if you 
don’t, tell us how you are thinking 
about it. Tell us what your plan is. 
I am hearing a lot about pecuniary 
interest. Let’s ask Colonial Pipeline 
whether there was a pecuniary interest 
in not having what happened to them 
happen. If you care about addressing 
this problem, we are giving companies 
a choice, either tell us where your ex-
pertise lies or how you are going to 
deal with it. 
Mr. Speaker, if you care about it, 
vote in favor of this amendment and 
vote in favor of this legislation. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD an article from 
The Wall Street Journal dated from 
2018, 
‘‘California 
Public 
Employees 
Vote Against Pension-Fund Activism.’’ 
[From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 18, 2018] 
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES VOTE AGAINST 
PENSION-FUND ACTIVISM 
(By Paul S. Atkins) 
Playing politics with other people’s sav-
ings is never popular. 
The California Public Employees’ Retire-
ment System this month said no thank you 
to pension-fund activism. Government work-
ers unseated Priya Mathur, the sitting 
Calpers president. She was defeated by Jason 
Perez, a police-union official who criticized 
Ms. Mathur’s focus on environmental, social 
and governance investing, or ESG. Mr. Perez 
emphasizes the agency’s fiduciary duty to 
maximize investor returns. 
Calpers represents almost two million 
California public employees, retirees and 
families. Yet it mostly makes headlines for 
its activism, such as divestiture from the to-
bacco industry. ‘‘It’s been used more as a po-
litical-action committee than a retirement 
fund,’’ said Mr. Perez. ‘‘I think the public 
agency [employees] are just sick of the she-
nanigans.’’ 
Americans have always invested to achieve 
personal goals, such as saving for a house or 
their kids’ college tuition. Some find that an 
ESG or issue-specific approach to investing 
accords with their personal philosophies. 
There is nothing wrong with people investing 
their own money however they like. But 
Calpers has a fiduciary duty to California 
public employees, who rely on it for retire-
ment security. 
Hester Peirce, a commissioner of the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission, recently 
observed, ‘‘When a pension-fund manager is 
making the decision to pursue her moral 
goals at the risk of financial return, the 
manager is putting other people’s retire-
ments at risk.’’ The danger for Calpers is 
real: In 2016 a consultant found that the 
fund’s beneficiaries missed up to $3 billion in 
investment gains from 2001–14. The reason? A 
divestiture from tobacco holdings for polit-
ical purposes. 
All this happens as Calpers remain under-
funded. Worse, its beneficiaries are stuck. 
They are locked into the system and cannot 
vote with their feet. 
While Calpers beneficiaries are demanding 
a renewed focus on returns, activists con-
tinue to work other channels to impose

agenda-driven requirements on public com-
panies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren last month 
unveiled a bill that would direct the SEC to 
mandate that all public companies disclose 
fossil-fuel use and greenhouse-gas emissions. 
This month a petition signed by 17 law pro-
fessors and institutional investors, including 
Calpers, asked the SEC to develop manda-
tory rules for public companies to disclose 
ESG information. 
The petition argues that since there are al-
ready so many requests to the SEC for issue- 
specific disclosures human-capital manage-
ment, climate, tax, human rights, pay ratios 
by sex, and political spending—the agency 
should impose a broader ESG disclosure 
framework. The laundry list of possible dis-
closures underscores the problem. Requiring 
companies to account for an ever-changing 
list of hard-to-quantify social issues dis-
tracts from disclosure’s real, statutory pur-
pose: giving the reasonable investor material 
information he needs to make investing deci-
sions. 
These proposals always tout purported 
benefits to investors, but mandatory disclo-
sure of additional immaterial information 
would be harmful. In a 2013 speech, former 
SEC Chairman Mary Jo White decried the 
‘‘information overload’’ in already bloated 
annual reports that obscures pertinent dis-
closures for investors amid a sea of extra-
neous information. She summarized: ‘‘What 
some investors might want may not be what 
reasonable 
investors 
need.’’ 
Translation: 
More information is not necessarily better 
information. 
Mandating politicized corporate disclo-
sures doesn’t align with the SEC’s mission to 
protect investors and facilitate capital for-
mation. Instead, it would divert resources 
away from business operations and growth. 
It is simply an attempt to shame public com-
panies into compliance with activists’ de-
mands. 
As Mr. Perez put it, criticizing a proposal 
to divest from some gun retailers earlier this 
year: ‘‘This is nothing more than a political 
ploy.’’ His push to prioritize performance 
over politics clearly resonated with Cali-
fornia public employees; lawmakers and pen-
sion-fund managers should take note. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. ROSE), and I thank him for 
his work on the Financial Services 
Committee. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to H.R. 1187. This legislation is 
just the latest attempt by my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
implement a far-left social agenda, this 
time through our securities laws. 
Contrary to the principles-based dis-
closure standard that is typical of most 
material risk disclosures, President 
Biden and the Democrat-led Securities 
and Exchange Commission have advo-
cated for a separate standardized set of 
disclosure requirements related to cli-
mate risk and environmental, social, 
and governance or ESG, concerns. This 
legislation would impose disclosure 
mandates that focus on costly one-size- 
fits-all metrics rather than material, 
decision-useful information for inves-
tors. 
During the markup process, several 
of my colleagues submitted common-
sense amendments that would have 
added an important materiality stand-
ard. These amendments would have re-
quired 
disclosure 
of 
ESG, 
climate 
change, or compensation metrics where 
there is a substantial likelihood that a 
reasonable shareholder would consider 
such a disclosure important with re-
spect to making an investment deci-
sion. However, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle refuse to support 
them, including this simple standard. 
By adding these additional disclosure 
requirements to the already substan-
tial list of mandatory disclosures for 
public companies, H.R. 1187 would also 
increase the cost of compliance for 
public companies, thereby discouraging 
private companies from going public. 
Further, I think it is important to 
point out that this legislation misses 
an opportunity to address China and its 
daily human rights atrocities. If we 
were serious about disclosure, not just 
a political agenda, we would be looking 
at security and democracy threats like 
those that the Chinese Communist 
Party and their state-owned enter-
prises pose. 
Bottom line, this legislation would 
add even more costly and confusing 
disclosure requirements, hurting every-
day investors, and discouraging initial 
public offerings, all while failing to in-
clude important national security pro-
tections. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the legislation. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. UNDERWOOD). 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of this legislation and 
my amendment with Representatives 
FRANKEL, NADLER, SPEIER, and BLUNT 
ROCHESTER, which would require public 
companies to report on workplace har-
assment settlements in their SEC fil-
ings. 
The amendment is pulled from the 
EMPOWER Act, a bipartisan bill I am 
proud to co-lead alongside Congress-
woman FRANKEL and my Republican 
and Democratic colleagues. 
For too long, many employers have 
tolerated, and even encouraged, a cul-
ture of secrecy surrounding workplace 
harassment, writing settlements off as 
a cost of doing business. 
This amendment would shine a light 
on major employers that fail to protect 
their employees, improve transparency 
for shareholders, and encourage compa-
nies to ensure a safe, healthy, and pro-
ductive workplace. 
This is an important bipartisan pol-
icy, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the amendment and the un-
derlying bill. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, could I 
inquire as to the remaining time on 
each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan has 111⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
California has 161⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 1187. 
This legislation would impose unneces-
sary and expensive compliance costs on 
publicly traded companies. 
Publicly traded companies are al-
ready subject to extensive disclosures 
regarding various risk factors under 
Federal law. These existing disclosures 
must already reflect material climate 
change information, such as compli-
ance with greenhouse gas emissions 
and carbon offsets. 
I am concerned this bill would do lit-
tle to provide information on how cli-
mate change would affect a particular 
investment, but would instead be used 
by activist shareholders with no real 
duty to a company or its shareholders 
to impose progressive political views 
on that company. 
The burden of these costs would fall 
largely on smaller public companies 
with fewer resources. The burden of 
these costs would, again, I think, put 
this entire issue off in a different direc-
tion than where it should be. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the bill. It would only benefit large in-
cumbent 
corporations 
while 
others 
may avoid going public altogether, 
limiting their growth.

FICE, 
June 14, 2021. 
Subject: H.R. 1187, The Corporate Govern-
ance Improvement and Investor Protec-
tion Act. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the California 
Public Employees’ Retirement System, I 
write to express support for the overall di-
rection of H.R. 1187, the ‘‘Corporate Govern-
ance Improvement and Investor Protection 
Act,’’ which would require public companies 
to disclose material information on the link 
between environmental, social, and govern-
ance (ESG) metrics and their long-term busi-
ness strategy, as well as political expendi-
tures, compensation practices, climate-re-
lated risk and tax expenditures, among other 
issues. This bill will improve and enhance 
corporate disclosures essential to maintain-
ing the competitiveness of U.S. financial 
markets. 
As the largest public defined benefit pen-
sion fund in the United States, we manage 
approximately $465 billion in global assets on 
behalf of more than two million members. 
Our fiduciary duty requires that we take a 
long-term view in assessing whether the 
companies that we hold in our portfolio are 
effectively managed and able to provide the 
sustainable, risk-adjusted returns that allow 
us to meet our commitments to pay benefits 
earned by these dedicated active and retired 
public servants for decades to come. 
We fundamentally depend on the integrity 
and efficiency of financial markets to meet 
these commitments and rely upon financial 
reporting to provide transparent and rel-
evant information about the economic per-
formance, conditions, and operations of the

June 16, 2021 
companies in which we invest. We believe 
corporate disclosure of material financial in-
formation is a precondition to maintaining 
effective and consistent corporate account-
ability and sustainable economic growth. As 
the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘SEC’’) has said in the past: 
‘‘Only through the steady flow of timely, 
comprehensive, and accurate information 
can people make sound investment decisions. 
The result of this information flow is a far 
more active, efficient, and transparent cap-
ital market that facilitates the capital for-
mation so important to our nation’s econ-
omy.’’ 
Critically, CalPERS and other pension 
funds are inhibited from adequately exer-
cising their fiduciary duty without such dis-
closures. Disclosure of material financial in-
formation is necessary to close the informa-
tion gap that occurs when management of a 
company is aware or should be aware of cer-
tain risks, yet such information is not avail-
able to shareowners. We believe H.R. 1187 
will address critical areas in which more 
high-quality, consistent, and comparable dis-
closures by public issuers are necessary, and 
build a more robust reporting regime that 
enhances shareowner value over the long- 
term. We are pleased that the following 
measures, which CalPERS has been on the 
record in supporting, are included in the Cor-
porate Governance Improvement and Inves-
tor Protection Act: 
H.R. 1187, the ESG Disclosure Simplifica-
tion Act, which would, among other things, 
require issuers to disclose certain ESG 
metrics to shareholders, the connection be-
tween those metrics and the issuer’s long- 
term business strategy, and the method by 
which 
the 
issuer 
determines 
how 
ESG 
metrics impact its long-term strategy. We 
believe the current quality and quantity of 
relevant ESG reporting does not meet inves-
tors’ needs and support the SEC playing a 
prominent role in standardizing and assuring 
the accuracy of ESG data reporting, and that 
it is reflected in company financials. 
H.R. 1087, the Shareholder Political Trans-
parency Act, which would require public 
companies to disclose detailed information 
about their political spending to the SEC 
and shareholders in specified quarterly and 
annual reports. The CalPERS Governance & 
Sustainability Principles call for responsible 
board oversight, including disclosures of cor-
porate charitable and political activity to 
ensure alignment with business strategy and 
to protect assets on behalf of shareowners. 
As fiduciaries, we need to know how our cap-
ital is being used, including if and when po-
litical expenditures are made. SEC rule-
making would bring clarity and consistency 
in the format and scope of disclosures and 
provide a cost-effective alternative to pri-
vate ordering. Furthermore, political ex-
penditure disclosure is consistent with the 
SEC’s requirement for public companies to 
disclose meaningful financial information 
and would encourage prudent use of cor-
porate shareowner resources for political ac-
tivities. 
H.R. 2570, the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, 
which would require public companies to re-
port financial risks posed to them by climate 
change, the processes they use to identify 
those risks, and the actions they take to 
mitigate those risks. Our investment strat-
egy is to make sure our portfolio is resilient 
to short-term and long-term risks, both of 
which include some dimension of climate 
change. We seek to find the investment op-
portunities 
that 
the 
energy 
transition 
brings, and to bring down emissions that 
contribute to global warming. We believe it 
is vital that companies identify, manage, 
and disclose material environmental risks 
and opportunities relevant to their short- 
term and long-term success. We support the 
establishment of a uniform reporting regime 
for climate change risk disclosures that 
would 
address 
key 
issues 
that 
impact 
shareowner 
value, 
including 
minimizing 
risk, maximizing returns, and ensuring ac-
countability from all those involved. 
H.R. 3007, the Disclosure of Tax Havens and 
Offshoring Act, which would require public 
companies to annually disclose information 
on their subsidiaries and specified country- 
by-country financial information including 
total pre-tax profits, total amounts paid in 
State, Federal, and foreign taxes, employees, 
and tangible assets. As an investor in many 
of the largest public companies in the world, 
we are acutely aware of the complexities of 
international taxes, and the increasingly im-
portant role that taxes play in corporate 
profitability. However, current tax disclo-
sures in the United States do not provide in-
vestors with sufficient tax-related informa-
tion to adequately assess companies’ valu-
ations and risks. We believe increasing 
transparency and requiring the disclosure of 
overly aggressive international tax planning 
arrangements helps to reduce systemic risk 
that threatens global markets and ensure 
stronger long-term outcomes. 
In addition, we are supportive of including 
additional provisions in the Corporate Gov-
ernance Improvement and Investor Protec-
tion Act, such as the following disclosures 
related to human capital management, board 
diversity, and cybersecurity: 
H.R. 3471, the Workforce Investment Dis-
closure Act, which would require public com-
panies to disclose information about their 
Human Capital Management (HCM) policies, 
practices, and performance in their annual 
reports. CalPERS expects fair, accurate, and 
timely reporting on how companies identify 
and manage risks related to the three forms 
of capital: financial, physical, and human. 
The fact that there are few standards for 
measuring and reporting on human capital 
topics makes it difficult for investors to 
truly understand related risks and opportu-
nities when assessing individual companies. 
We believe that rules-based disclosures with 
numeric metrics provide crucial information 
to long-term investors, like CalPERS, who 
are concerned about sustainability over 
time. We have made recommendations in our 
comment letter on the SEC’s proposed rule-
making under Regulation S-K for metrics 
that should be disclosed by all registrants, 
including the number of full-time, part-time, 
and contingent workers; employee turnover 
rates; health and safety, employee engage-
ment and diversity statistics. 
H.R. 1277, the Improving Corporate Govern-
ance Through Diversity Act, which would re-
quire public companies to annually disclose 
the voluntary, self-identified racial, ethnic, 
gender, and veteran status of their board of 
directors, nominees, and senior executives, 
and establishes an advisory group to rec-
ommend strategies to increase diversity in 
these leadership positions. We support initia-
tives that promote talent diversity—includ-
ing a broad range of education, experience, 
thoughts, perspectives, and competencies—to 
help enable effective board leadership. We 
view board diversity in terms of skill sets, 
sex, age, nationality, race, sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, disability, and histori-
cally underrepresented groups, and believe 
requiring public companies to annually dis-
close the self-identified racial, ethnic, gen-
der, and veteran status of their board of di-
rectors, nominees, and senior executives is 
an 
important 
step 
toward 
challenging 
‘‘group think’’ in corporate boardrooms and 
C-suites, which can severely limit compa-
nies’ ability to innovate and effectively en-
gage with shareowners and other stake-
holders. 
H.R. ll, the Cybersecurity Disclosure 
Act, which would require companies to dis-
close in their annual reports to the SEC, or 
in their annual proxy statements, whether 
any member of their board of directors, or 
similar governing body, has expertise or ex-
perience in cybersecurity and the nature of 
such expertise or experience. If there are no 
members of a company’s governing body that 
have experience or expertise in cybersecu-
rity, it would require the company to de-
scribe what other cybersecurity aspects were 
taken into account by persons responsible 
for identifying and evaluating nominees for 
the company’s governing body. We believe 
requiring the disclosure of cybersecurity ex-
pertise—or lack thereof—on corporate boards 
will increase transparency for investors and 
help to ensure that public companies are ap-
propriately prioritizing cybersecurity and 
data privacy matters. It represents a reason-
able and timely response to the increasing 
prominence of cybersecurity threats in our 
financial markets and the broader economy. 
In sum, CalPERS believes that clear, con-
sistent, and substantive disclosures of cli-
mate risk, charitable and political expendi-
tures, 
human 
capital 
management, 
and 
board diversity are critical to the long-term 
success of capital markets and, more criti-
cally, of investors. Disclosures of such infor-
mation will help investors allocate capital 
and exercise stewardship at companies to en-
sure long term sustainable value creation. 
Such disclosures will also encourage cor-
porations to be more mindful of these risks 
that could impact their financial success 
over the long term, and will provide for 
greater transparency regarding cash flow, 
corporate expenditures, and public policy en-
gagement. 
Thank you for considering our views. We 
look forward to working with Congress to 
advance initiatives that will improve cor-
porate disclosures in both the public and pri-
vate markets. Please do not hesitate to con-
tact me directly, or your staff can contact 
Danny Brown, Chief of our Legislative Af-
fairs Division, if we can be of any assistance 
as this measure proceeds. 
Sincerely, 
MARCIE FROST, 
Chief Executive Officer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2842 
June 16, 2021 
and other groups are permitted to make un-
limited political expenditures, as long as 
they are not directly given to candidates or 
parties. The Court assumed, however, that 
this spending would be disclosed to investors 
so they could have input. Not addressed by 
the Court, however, was the fact that share-
holders might not be aware of this spending 
or specific details of where the money might 
be going. In response, a bipartisan group of 
securities law experts filed a petition with 
the SEC to require corporations to disclose 
their political spending activities, and drew 
more than 1.2 million comments, the most in 
SEC history. The SEC has not yet addressed 
this decade-old petition, and passage of this 
legislation would jumpstart the rulemaking. 
Public Citizen has long championed this 
important disclosure requirement. Political 
spending exposes a company to reputational 
risk when it involves itself controversial 
issues. Many corporations recognize this 
problem. For example, a number of compa-
nies ceased campaign contributions to cer-
tain lawmakers associated with the January 
6; 2021 insurrection at the Capitol and in con-
nection to the voter suppression bills moving 
through statehouses. 
While some corporate political spending is 
already voluntarily disclosed, a considerable 
amount is funneled through trade associa-
tions such as the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, which deploys large numbers of 
agents to meet with members of Congress. 
Often, the Chamber advances or promotes 
policies that an individual company may 
find uncomfortable were they associated 
with it openly, such as opposition to climate 
reform or worker safety measures. If compa-
nies’ spending on backward issues became 
known to the public, it could lead to mate-
rial, reputational harm and ultimately sub-
tract from shareholder value. 
Public Citizen heartily endorses this meas-
ure. 
H.R. 1188, THE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY IN PAY 
ACT (VELA´ ZQUEZ) 
This bill would require public companies, 
excluding emerging growth companies, to 
disclose certain employee pay raise informa-
tion, comparing the CEO with the median- 
paid employee at the firm. This measure 
builds on a reform in the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
that first required identification of the me-
dian-paid worker at a firm. This requirement 
meant that firms were required to add one 
more item regarding employees to the sole 
requirement existing, namely, the number of 
employees. 
For a half-century, the fruits of produc-
tivity gains have clotted in the C-suite, with 
average workers receiving little or no in-
crease in real compensation. This has led to 
income and wealth inequality. During the 
pandemic, this played out in the need for 
trillions of dollars in emergency relief, as av-
erage people lacked the savings to survive a 
temporary loss of employment. Disclosures 
of these pay gaps can help lawmakers devise 
more ambitious reforms to address the wid-
ening gap between those workers who truly 
drive the economy and elites. 
Public Citizen urges you to support this 
bill. 
H.R. 2570, THE CLIMATE RISK DISCLOSURE ACT 
(CASTEN) AND H.R. 1187, THE ESG DISCLOSURE 
SIMPLIFICATION ACT (VARGAS) 
Both of these bills deal with the increasing 
demand from investors and the public for in-
formation related to environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) issues. H.R. 2570 would 
require public companies to disclose in their 
annual reports information relating to the 
financial and business risks associated with 
climate change. The bill also requires the 
SEC to establish, in consultation with other 
relevant financial agencies, climate-related 
risk disclosure metrics and guidance, which 
will be industry-specific, and will require 
companies to make both quantitative and 
qualitative disclosures. H.R. 1187 requires 
the SEC to define what ESG metrics means 
and requires firms to disclose those metrics 
along with how ESG metrics accord with a 
firm ’s long-term strategy. It also requires 
the SEC to establish a committee that would 
provide advice to the commission on sustain-
able finance issues. 
Given the physical and transition risks in-
herent to the ongoing climate crisis and the 
shift away from fossil fuels and carbon-in-
tensive industry, investors need more infor-
mation about companies’ growing climate fi-
nancial risk, their contribution to climate 
change, and their plans for remaining viable 
in a low-carbon future economy. Requiring 
the SEC to establish climate-related risk 
disclosure metrics falls squarely within the 
agency’s mission to protect investors; ensure 
fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and fa-
cilitate capital formation. Indeed, the agen-
cy has expressed its intention to explore a 
climate disclosure rule. Adopting this legis-
lation would explicitly clarify the SEC’s au-
thority to adopt such a rule in the face of po-
tential legal challenges from issuers and ide-
ological opponents alike. 
At the same time, it is important to re-
member that climate change is not just an 
environmental crisis, but one of social jus-
tice, wealth distribution, equity and human 
rights. It is vitally important that disclo-
sures from issuers include elements of envi-
ronmental and climate justice, as well as 
other ESG issues like political spending; tax; 
lobbying; diversity, equity, and inclusion; 
and human capital management practices to 
allow investors to make a holistic assess-
ment of an issuer’s overall sustainability and 
make more informed investment decisions. 
Despite many firms reporting some ESG 
data, the available information has not sat-
isfied the needs of investors because it essen-
tially allows firms to self-determine and re-
port which climate risks are material. Many 
firms provide only vague, boilerplate disclo-
sures or do not address climate risk at all. 
Management is often overly optimistic about 
a firm’s climate resilience, may not fully un-
derstand what investors actually believe is 
material or want to know, and may have an 
interest in obscuring parts of the picture, 
leading to drastic under-reporting of risks. 
The provisions in this bill represent a major 
step forward in terms of the quality of infor-
mation that would be available to investors. 
We strongly encourage you to support 
these bills. 
H.R. 3007, THE DISCLOSURE OF TAX HAVENS AND 
OFFSHORING ACT (AXNE) 
This bill would require public companies to 
disclose their total pre-tax profits, and total 
amounts paid in state, federal, and foreign 
taxes on a country-by-country basis. The bill 
would also require companies to disclose a 
number of specific tax-related items for each 
of its subsidiaries, as well as on a consoli-
dated basis, such as total accrued tax ex-
penses, stated capital, and total accumulated 
earnings. This legislation would ensure in-
vestors and the public at large are provided 
with enough information to discern if the 
companies they are invested in are partici-
pating in risky behavior like corporate tax 
avoidance. Many U.S. multinational compa-
nies use accounting maneuvers to book their 
profits in low- or no-tax jurisdictions, or 
‘‘tax havens.’’ This legislation to mandate 
public country-by-country reporting would 
indeed aim to discourage and curb the trend 
of corporations’ profit shifting to tax havens 
as these public reports would shed light on 
corporations that aggressively use avoidance 
practices to shirk their tax responsibilities, 
which creates both reputational and finan-
cial risk. 
We urge you to approve this bill. 
We also ask your support for amendments 
expected to be offered to this suite of bills, 
including: 
H.R. 3471, the Workforce Investment Dis-
closure Act (Axne): this bill would require 
the SEC to implement petitioned rule-
making that would require public companies 
to disclose human capital management poli-
cies, practices, and performance. While cor-
porations often claim that employees are 
their most valuable asset, shareholders know 
too little about investments in these assets. 
H.R. 1277, the Improving Corporate Govern-
ance Through Diversity Act (Meeks): This 
bill would require public companies to annu-
ally disclose the voluntarily, self-identified 
gender, race, ethnicity and veteran status of 
their board directors. This measure helps 
corporations better identify how they are 
promoting diversity in the highest ranks. 
H.R. ll, the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act 
(Himes): This bill would require the SEC to 
issue rules to require companies in their an-
nual reports to the SEC or in their annual 
proxy statements to disclose whether any 
member of their board of directors, or simi-
lar governing body, has expertise or experi-
ence in cybersecurity and the nature of such 
expertise or experience. If there are no mem-
bers of a company’s governing body that 
have experience or expertise in cybersecu-
rity, the bill would require the company to 
describe what other cybersecurity aspects 
were taken into account by persons respon-
sible for identifying and evaluating nomi-
nees for the company’s governing body. 
With high-level hacks recently grinding 
important companies to a halt and cyberse-
curity affecting all walks of life, investors 
should be aware of how well corporations are 
prepared to defend themselves against at-
tack. 
Public Citizen strongly urges you to vote 
yes on these important pieces of legislation 
and amendments to provide greater informa-
tion to investors, watchdog organizations, 
and the public at large. 
For questions, please contact Bartlett 
Naylor. 
Sincerely, 
PUBLIC CITIZEN. 
NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES 
ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION, INC., 
Washington, DC, June 15, 2021. 
Re H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance and 
Investor Protection Act of 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of the North American Secu-
rities 
Administrators 
Association, 
Inc. 
(‘‘NASAA’’), 
I 
am 
writing 
to 
express 
NASAA’s support for several provisions of 
H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance and In-
vestor Protection Act, which the House is 
scheduled to consider this week, as amended 
and favorably reported by the House Com-
mittee on Rules on June 14, 2020. As further 
detailed below, NASAA also strongly sup-
ports two amendments to H.R. 1187 that were 
made in order by the Committee on Rules. 
The first such amendment addresses disclo-
sure of information related to the diversity 
on the boards of directors of U.S. public com-
panies, while the second amendment address-
es disclosure of cybersecurity expertise at 
the leadership level of such companies. I sin-
cerely appreciate your attention to NASAA’s 
views.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2843 
June 16, 2021 
(1) THE ESG DISCLOSURE SIMPLIFICATION ACT 
(TITLE I) 
Increasingly, investors view a company’s 
environmental, social, and governance, or 
‘‘ESG’’ practices, as a material metric for 
determining whether to invest. To date, how-
ever, there are no uniform standards for the 
reporting of environmental and certain other 
ESG factors in the United States. In the ab-
sence of such standards, public companies 
lack clarity when making disclosures relat-
ing to ESG considerations. In some cases, 
they may have incentives to make selective 
or potentially misleading disclosures about 
the benefits of their practices, products, or 
services. Title I of H.R. 1187, the Corporate 
Governance and Investor Protect Act, seeks 
to remedy that problem. 
The ESG Disclosure Simplification Act, as 
embodied in Title I, would require public 
companies to disclose in filings with the U.S. 
Securities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission 
(‘‘SEC’’) and any proxy or solicitation mate-
rials that describe the ‘‘views of the issuer 
regarding links between ESG metrics and 
the long-term strategy of the issuer’’ and 
any process the issuer uses to determine the 
long-term business strategy of the issuer. 
Further, the bill would express the non-
binding ‘‘Sense of Congress’’ that ‘‘environ-
mental, 
social, 
and 
governance 
[ESG] 
metrics’’ are ‘‘de-facto material’’ for the pur-
poses of disclosure under the Securities Ex-
change Act of 1934. The bill would also create 
a new permanent ‘‘Sustainable Finance Ad-
visory Committee’’ within the SEC, that 
would, within 18 months of its first meeting, 
be required to submit ‘‘recommendations 
about what ESG metrics’’ the SEC should re-
quire to be disclosed. 
The time has come to provide investors 
seeking to understand factors relating to a 
company’s ESG profile with the ability to 
accurately understand and weigh ESG risks 
in their investment decisions, and Congress 
can play an important role in this regard. 
NASAA has previously called for Congress to 
enact legislation that would direct the SEC 
to develop a uniform standard for ESG re-
porting by public companies so that inves-
tors can understand companies’ real prac-
tices and impact, and ‘‘make ‘head-to-head’ 
comparisons 
between 
competing 
invest-
ments.’’ NASAA has also urged that Con-
gress consider legislation that would direct 
the SEC to establish a task force to consoli-
date, to the extent possible, themes from ex-
isting reporting frameworks and standards 
in order to catalyze faster progress toward 
standardization.’’ Title I of H.R. 1187 marks 
an opportunity to ‘‘move the ball forward’’ 
on both of these recommendations; there-
fore, NASAA is pleased to support its pas-
sage. 
(2) THE CYBERSECURITY DISCLOSURE ACT 
(AMENDMENT #1) 
The Cybersecurity Disclosure Act, as filed 
as an amendment to H.R. 1187, is identical to 
stand-alone legislation recently introduced 
in the Senate as S. 808. NASAA was pleased 
to support this important legislation at the 
time of its introduction, and we are pleased 
to support its inclusion in H.R. 1187. 
The Cybersecurity Disclosure Act would 
require publicly traded companies to include 
in their annual disclosure filings with the 
SEC information detailing whether any 
member of their governing body, such as 
their board of directors or general partner, 
possesses expertise or experience in cyberse-
curity. If no member has such expertise or 
experience, companies would be required to 
detail what, if any, other cybersecurity con-
siderations were considered by the persons 
responsible for identifying and evaluating 
nominees for the governing body. 
For nearly a decade, the list of public com-
panies and financial institutions targeted by 
organized cyber-attacks has continued to 
grow with ever-increasing frequency. Over 
the past year, moreover, this threat has ac-
celerated further due in part to the COVID– 
19 pandemic. Because many millions of 
Americans are conducting much or most of 
their lives online—and because an unprece-
dented number of U.S. employees arc work-
ing remotely—cybercriminals and scammers 
have an abundance of opportunities to infil-
trate business security networks to install 
malware, steal personally identifiable infor-
mation (‘‘PII’’) of customers and clients, and 
create other problems. 
Incentivizing publicly traded companies to 
consider whether they have appropriate cy-
bersecurity expertise on their governing 
body is a common-sense way to promote 
greater attention to cybersecurity risk by 
public corporations. Investors and customers 
are well-served by policies that encourage 
companies 
to 
consider 
such 
risks 
proactively, as opposed to after a data 
breach has already occurred when investors 
and customers have already been harmed. 
Importantly, the Cybersecurity Disclosure 
Act does not require companies to do any-
thing beyond disclosing information; the bill 
encourages companies to act in their own 
best interests by creating an incentive for 
them to prioritize cybcrsecurity expertise at 
the senior levels of leadership. 
NASAA shares Congress’s interest in ad-
dressing the threat cybersecurity risk has on 
public companies and investors. We are 
pleased to support Amendment #1, and we 
urge its passage. 
(3) THE IMPROVING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
THROUGH DIVERSITY ACT (AMENDMENT #11) 
The 
Improving 
Corporate 
Governance 
Through Diversity Act, as filed as an amend-
ment to H.R. 1187, is identical to stand-alone 
legislation entitled H.R. 1277, the Improving 
Corporate Governance Through Diversity 
Act. NASAA was pleased to support H.R. 1277 
was it was considered and approved by the 
House Financial Services Committee in 
April 2020 and is pleased to again support the 
bill as an amendment to H.R. 1187. 
The 
Improving 
Corporate 
Governance 
Through Diversity Act would require public 
companies to disclose annual information on 
the voluntary self-identified racial, ethnic, 
gender, and veteran composition of their 
boards of directors and executive officers. 
The bill would also require that such compa-
nies disclose whether their boards of direc-
tors have adopted any ‘‘policy, plan or strat-
egy’’ to promote diversity among these bod-
ies, and would instruct the SEC’s Office of 
Minority and Women Inclusion to develop 
and publish ‘‘best practices,’’ in order to help 
public companies comply with the new diver-
sity reporting requirements. In addition, the 
Act would establish a new ‘‘Diversity Advi-
sory Group’’ within the SEC, which would be 
exempt from the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee Act, and be comprised of representa-
tives from the Federal government, state 
and local governments, academia, and the 
private sector. Under the Act, the Advisory 
Group would be tasked with identifying 
strategies to ‘‘increase gender, racial and 
ethnic diversity among members of the 
board of directors of the issuer,’’ and be re-
quired to report periodically to Congress and 
the public. 
NASAA has repeatedly called for Congress 
to examine the current state of corporate 
board composition with an eye toward en-
couraging greater diversity. In doing so, 
NASAA has noted that leading research indi-
cates that greater board diversity correlates 
with sound corporate governance and en-
hances the performance of public companies. 
We have also noted evidence that shows that 
investors themselves increasingly regard 
corporate board diversity to be an indication 
of good governance, which improves both 
corporate performance and investor rela-
tions. Most recently, in NASAA’s Legislative 
Agenda for the 117th Congress, state securi-
ties regulators called for Congress to pass 
legislation ‘‘to require public companies to 
disclose information that demonstrates the 
diversity on their boards, or the lack there-
of, as well as information regarding the di-
versity of their corporate operations.’’ 
NASAA congratulates the House for its de-
cision to consider including the Improving 
Corporate Governance Through Diversity 
Act as an amendment to H.R. 1187, and we 
urge its passage. 
Thank you for your consideration of 
NASAA’s views. If we may be of further as-
sistance, please do not hesitate to contact 
me or Michael Canning, NASAA’s Director of 
Policy and Government Affairs. 
Sincerely, 
LISA HOPKINS, 
NASAA 
President, 
General Counsel and 
Senior Deputy Com-
missioner of Securi-
ties, West Virginia. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time 
until the gentleman from Michigan 
yields back. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, just a 
point of information for the chair from 
California: We have one more speaker, 
and I will be prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, the bill we 
have been considering today is puzzling 
for Republicans, as it probably is for a 
large number of my Democratic friends 
as well. 
On the one hand, the far left seeks to 
blame so much of what is bad in the 
world on large public companies. But 
then they turn around and claim that 
these same companies will see the light 
and embrace extreme leftwing policies 
if only they disclose more of their ac-
tivities in obscure SEC reports. Mind 
you, these are perfectly legal activi-
ties, too. 
But no serious Member of the House 
can believe the world works like this. 
The far left wants to claim they are he-
roes using the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to fight the scourges of 
our time, from foreign dictatorships to 
environmental degradation. But in re-
ality, they are weaponizing financial 
regulation, and their support for this 
bill comes in the form of empty polit-
ical rhetoric masquerading as sound 
corporate governance. Make no mis-
take, Mr. Speaker, this bill is about po-
liticizing securities regulation. 
Far from this fantasy land live the 
majority of House Members who under-
stand that there are actual urgent 
problems we can solve only if we work 
together to address them. 
Perhaps the gravest of these prob-
lems is represented by the goals of the 
Chinese Communist Party, which is 
perpetrating the great crime of our age 
against the Uighurs and other minori-
ties in China. Beijing is also working 
to stamp out the vibrant democratic

June 16, 2021 
culture in Hong Kong, hoping all the 
while that Congress will look the other 
way. 
If we are truly concerned by public 
companies that may be working with 
bad actors—particularly bad actors re-
sponsible for China’s worst human 
rights 
abuses—then 
burying 
their 
names on the SEC’s website will 
achieve absolutely nothing. We need to 
ensure that they are referred to the 
Treasury Department so that we can 
impose sanctions, and that is what my 
motion to recommit will do. 
Under this MTR, instead of reporting 
on malign Chinese companies to the 
SEC—an agency that has long ac-
knowledged its lack of expertise and, 
frankly, its lack of capability and in-
terest 
in 
pursuing 
foreign 
policy 
goals—we will instead make sure that 
entities in corporate supply chains are 
flagged for the Treasury when public 
companies have reason to believe they 
are involved in atrocities in Xinjiang, 
from mass surveillance to forced labor 
and other violations of basic human 
rights. 
Companies will also be able to sound 
the alarm on entities complicit in Chi-
na’s assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms, 
allowing OFAC at the Treasury to de-
termine whether it can impose new 
sanctions. 
We must cut off offenders from the 
global economy until China changes 
course. We must rely on appeals to 
their bottom line and not their con-
science. That is the power of U.S. sanc-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion 
to recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on Financial Services to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 1178. My 
amendment doesn’t pretend we can 
fight genocide, authoritarianism, mass 
detentions, 
mass 
surveillance, 
and 
other human rights violations with 
meaningless 
rhetoric 
on 
corporate 
transparency, none of which keeps Chi-
na’s leaders up at night. 
There are over 1 million Uighurs de-
tained in China and over 100 facilities 
covering millions of square feet sus-
pected as sites of forced labor. It is an 
insult to Beijing’s victims to claim 
that disclosure tweaks from the SEC 
will stop this. Securities regulation 
will not stop this. 
Mr. Speaker, we can either pass half 
measures that we know won’t work and 
then wring our hands later when the 
problem remains unresolved, or we can 
articulate what we want to target and 
take real action. The former is beneath 
the dignity of this House. 
Measly disclosures in securities fil-
ings, transforming 10–Ks from 100 pages 
to thousands of pages, that is not going 
to solve the problem. The former is be-
neath the dignity of the House. The 
latter is embodied in my amendment: 
sanctions, OFAC using the power of the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. I want 
to make sure we are clear not only 
with my colleagues but to those who 
may be listening and watching today. 
Our side of the aisle has a couple of 
problems with this legislation today. 
First and foremost is the structure; 
next is the content; and then third, we 
have to question motivation. 
What is the problem with the struc-
ture? 
My friend from Connecticut talked 
about an issue that we have a lot of 
agreement on, and I say to him: Amen, 
hallelujah, let’s talk about cybersecu-
rity. Let’s talk about how corporations 
are going to be held responsible for 
that. 
However, my colleague from Iowa is 
talking about corporate tax law and 
country-by-country 
tax 
reporting. 
Now, that might be a good issue, but it 
is the wrong committee. I wondered to 
myself 
if 
Chairman 
DINGELL, 
who 
chaired the Ways and Means Com-
mittee for a few decades, and my col-
league from Michigan, would have al-
lowed this committee mission creep. 
Actually, I don’t wonder. I know ex-
actly what he would have said: Hell, 
no. This is in my committee. 
This issue is in the wrong committee, 
and Financial Services is not the right 
and proper place to be doing that. 
Let’s look at the content of these 
bills. We are not debating climate, and 
we are not debating these social issues 
that need to be addressed. We are de-
bating who is responsible for enforcing 
these. We are not debating the failures 
and flaws of humans. We are ques-
tioning who should be the enforcer of 
these regulations and if they are 
equipped to do so. 
Now, not that long ago, before 
defunding the police was a popular 
item to discuss, the SEC was com-
monly called on all sides the cop on the 
beat. They were the cops on the beat 
who were the enforcers. They were the 
ones who were coming along and say-
ing: We are going to make sure that 
there is no fraud as we protect inves-
tors; we are going to make sure that 
we have efficient markets; and we are 
going to make sure that we are build-
ing capital. 
Here is the problem: They are not 
prepared and equipped to do so. 
Don’t take my word for it. Let’s look 
at President Obama’s head of the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission, Mary 
Jo White, who said: ‘‘When disclosure 
gets to be too much or strays from its 
core purposes, it can lead to ‘informa-
tion overload,’ a phenomenon in which 
ever-increasing amounts of disclosure 
make it difficult for investors to focus 
on the information that is material 
and most relevant to their decision-
making as investors in our financial 
markets. To safeguard the benefits of 
this ‘signature mandate,’ the SEC 
needs to maintain the ability to exer-
cise its own independent judgment and 
expertise when deciding whether and 
how best to impose new disclosure re-
quirements.’’ 
She also said at one point that the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
was not prepared to do enforcement on 
areas that they had no expertise. She 
was referring to conflict minerals. 
That was also part of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. 
So, we have a number of issues that 
are in this content. Earlier, my col-
league, the chair from California, sub-
mitted a letter from CalPERS in sup-
port of this. Earlier, just prior to that, 
I had submitted an article from The 
Wall Street Journal where CalPERS 
had actually had a massive regime 
change—this was in 2018—regarding 
this pension fund activism. 
At the time, Mr. Perez, who was 
elected as the president of CalPERS, 
said: 
CalPERS has been used more as a political 
action committee than a retirement fund. I 
think the public agency employees are just 
sick of the shenanigans. 
Hester Peirce, a Commissioner with 
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, recently observed: ‘‘When a pen-
sion fund manager is making the deci-
sion to pursue her moral goals at the 
risk of financial return, the manager is 
putting other people’s retirements at 
risk.’’ 
She was referring to the person 
whom Mr. Perez had beaten in that 
election. 
The danger is real. In 2016, a consult-
ant found that the CalPERS fund bene-
ficiaries missed up to $3 billion in in-
vestment gains from 2001 to 2014. The 
reason? A divestiture of tobacco hold-
ings for political purposes. 
I wonder if this might be why some of 
the motivation for those on the other 
side, that they want to cover them-
selves. They want to make sure they 
are not open to the liability of retirees 
or others with a fiduciary being held 
responsible for bad decisionmaking 
when they use these amorphous, non-
defined issues to make political state-
ments rather than investment choices. 
Madam Speaker, at the end of the 
day, what we have here is a problem 
not just of the issues but of the en-
forcement. I believe that if we are ask-
ing the ‘‘cop on the beat,’’ the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission, to do a 
job that is up to the streets and main-
tenance department, then no one could 
expect that they are prepared for that. 
How can we expect that they are going 
to be able to do this? 
With that, and including my opening 
statement where we looked at the dis-
incentive to make sure there are more 
investment opportunities for everyday 
investors—our constituents—I must re-
main opposed to H.R. 1187. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time is re-
maining.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2845 
June 16, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
MCBATH). The gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia has 161⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this bill provides 
urgently needed investor protections 
by requiring the Securities and Ex-
change Commission to adopt clear, 
consistent standards for ESG metrics. 
Without the information requirements 
in this bill, investors are left with in-
consistent information across compa-
nies and are ultimately unable to fully 
assess their investment decisions. 
Investors deserve to know the risks 
they are exposed to with relation to 
climate change, political expenditures, 
and other important factors. We must 
make this right and take action to 
bring accountability to public compa-
nies. 
Some or all of the provisions of this 
package have been supported by Public 
Citizen, AFL–CIO, SEIU, California 
Public Employees’ Retirement System, 
Americans for Financial Reform, Coun-
cil of Institutional Investors, United 
Nations Principles for Responsible In-
vestment, Americans for Tax Fairness, 
North American Securities Adminis-
trators Association, FACT Coalition, 
Oxfam America, Ceres, and Sierra 
Club, among others. 
For years, investors and market par-
ticipants have been demanding more 
and better disclosures regarding ESG 
matters, which research shows can 
have significant impacts on the short- 
and long-term values of companies. 
For example, a report issued by the 
BlackRock Investment Institute found 
that companies that score high on ESG 
measures are better able to adapt to 
environmental and societal changes, 
use resources more efficiently, have 
more productive employees, and tend 
to face lower risk of reputational dam-
age and regulatory action. 
Matters related to climate risk, the 
ways companies invest in their workers 
and further diversity, spend their cash 
on political expenditures, their global 
human rights records, their tax avoid-
ance strategies, and how they invest in 
crucial corporate infrastructure such 
as cybersecurity are all significant and 
material factors in companies’ short- 
and long-term viability. 
Investors, who are the true owners of 
our Nation’s public companies, recog-
nize the importance of this information 
to their decisionmaking and have been 
demanding this information for years. 
For example, in 2018, a coalition of 
public pension funds asset managers 
and others representing over $5 trillion 
in assets petitioned the SEC for rule-
making on mandatory ESG disclosures. 
Over 2,300 investment managers, asset 
managers, and service providers rep-
resenting over $80 trillion in assets 
under management have become sig-
natories to the United Nations Prin-
ciples 
for 
Responsible 
Investment, 
which commits to incorporating ESG 
factors into their investment decisions. 
A group of 35 institutional investors 
representing over $6.6 trillion in assets 
form the Human Capital Management 
Coalition has petitioned the SEC to 
adopt rules to require issuers to dis-
close information related to their 
human capital management policies, 
practices, and performance. 
b 1330 
When the SEC solicited comments on 
political spending disclosures in 2011, it 
received over one million comments; 
by far more comments than any other 
SEC rulemaking petition, and the vast 
majority of which were overwhelm-
ingly favorable. Yet the SEC’s efforts 
were stymied because the Senate mi-
nority leader has personally insisted on 
statutorily prohibiting the SEC from 
even studying the issue. 
However, we are currently without 
clear, consistent standards for this in-
formation to be disclosed. Investors 
will continue to be left in the dark. It 
is time we give investors and markets 
the information they have been de-
manding for so long. 
And let me be absolutely clear about 
who we are fighting for. The other side 
has taken up the issue, as it tends to 
want to protect these big public cor-
porations from disclosures. 
It is for the American workers, the 
retirees, who worked their whole lives 
to save for retirement, for the public 
pension funds investing on behalf of 
our Nation’s teachers and our fire-
fighters, and other frontliners. We are 
fighting to ensure they have been given 
the tools they need to protect what 
they have worked so hard for, to 
achieve the American Dream. 
So I would urge all of my colleagues 
who are concerned about not only the 
retail investors, but concerned about 
the institutional investors who are re-
sponsible for these teachers and these 
firefighters and these others that I 
have alluded to, and their ability to 
feel safe and comfortable that deci-
sions are being made that are in the 
best interest of the people who are in-
vested in them. 
So I would ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote on 
this very, very comprehensive and seri-
ous legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 1187. Importantly, this 
package contains language from my legisla-
tion, the Greater Accountability in Pay Act that 
requires public companies to disclose the pay 
raise percentage of its executives and the pay 
raise percentage of its median employees 
over the past year and compare each to the 
rate of inflation. It also requires these compa-
nies to disclose the ratio between the two pay 
raise percentages. 
This legislation is the next logical step of the 
CEO pay ratio disclosure requirement in the 
Dodd-Frank Act. The COVID–19 pandemic 
has left millions of working-class Americans 
feeling vulnerable and uncertain about their 
economic future—with many individuals and 
families facing reduced hours, furloughs, or 
outright dismissals. 
However, an article published by the New 
York Times in April demonstrates the extraor-
dinarily successful year it’s been, financially, 
for America’s biggest CEOs—even at many of 
the companies hit hardest by the events of the 
pandemic. The Times highlights how compa-
nies like AT&T, Hilton, Boeing, and Norwegian 
Cruise Line all took billions of dollars in losses 
in 2020 but still managed to pay each of their 
CEOs more than $20 million. 
Unfortunately, 
excessive 
compensation 
packages received by many of America’s 
CEOs is not a new or isolated event. The dis-
parity between executive compensation and 
the average worker pay has been growing for 
decades. In August 2019, the Economic Policy 
Institute produce a report which highlights that, 
even before the pandemic, CEOs were earn-
ing far more than the typical worker, with CEO 
pay growing 940 percent between 1978 and 
2018 while the wages for the typical worker 
grew by just 11.9 percent over that same pe-
riod. 
Additional transparency on pay ratios will 
also benefit investors, as data is key to their 
decision-making process. A balanced pay ratio 
is an indicator of a company’s strong long- 
term performance and further pay ratio disclo-
sures would provide better insight on a com-
pany’s strategy, its values, and long-term out-
look. 
In order to get our economy back on track 
for everyone, we must increase worker pay 
and ensure that CEO pay ratios are in line 
with a corporation’s fundamentals. I urge my 
colleagues to vote YES on bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

‘‘(3) INCLUSION OF NOTICE WITH RESPECT TO

TAX
INCREASES.—With 
respect to each disclosure made by a covered 
issuer pursuant to paragraph (2), if the Fed-
eral corporate tax rate in effect during the

the disclosure shall contain the following ad-

‘‘(A) With respect to any disclosure of 
taxes paid to the Federal Government, the 
disclosure shall include a calculation of what 
such payment would have been had the Fed-

it was on June 1, 2021. 
‘‘(B) The following notice: ‘As a result of a 
change in U.S. Federal corporate tax law en-
acted during the 
lllll 
Administra-
tion(s), our company has lll fewer dollars 
to pay its workforce, invest in our business, 
or return capital to its investors.’. (With the

issuer to the Federal Government during the 
reporting period and what that payment

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 473, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
This amendment is designed to high-
light the impact that increased taxes 
have on companies and their work-
force. 
Like many Members of this body, I 
owned my own business prior to being 
elected to Congress. I know firsthand 
what it takes to make a payroll, ex-
pand your business, keep the lights on. 
Running a business takes the owner’s 
blood, sweat, and tears to succeed, but 
it also requires capital. Heavier taxes 
can have significant impacts on a com-
pany’s operation, certainly a com-
pany’s access to capital and their over-
all fiscal health. 
If we are to follow the premise of this 
bill, that investors need the Federal 
Government to mandate the disclosure 
of immaterial information, then the 
impact of tax hikes must be included. 
That is why I am offering this amend-
ment. 
This amendment would require pub-
licly traded companies that pay Fed-
eral taxes to disclose the effects of any 
future U.S. corporate tax increases. 
Specifically, the company must cal-
culate and disclose the difference be-
tween the amount in taxes it would 
have paid under laws in effect on June 
1, 2021, and the actual amount paid 
after the taxes were increased. 
Additionally, the company must ac-
knowledge in writing which President 
signed the higher taxes into law. 
Finally, the company must specify 
the decreased amount of capital that it 
now has to pay its workforce, reinvest 
in the company, or return capital to 
shareholders. 
So I do want to be clear. I am op-
posed to Congress forcing disclosure of 
immaterial information, as H.R. 1187 
would require. But if Congress is going 
to require companies to disclose other 
immaterial information, then it is only 
appropriate for Congress to require the 
disclosure of the effects of higher 
taxes. Requiring disclosures of certain 
tax-related information will not pro-
vide the whole picture without also 
looking at the impact of tax hikes. 
If we are forcing disclosure of all this 
tax-related information that we have 
heard the Democrats propose, then why 
shouldn’t investors know exactly and 
plainly how a President’s tax increase 
bill impacts the bottom line of the 
companies, those same companies in 
which they have invested their life sav-
ings? 
As our economy continues to recover 
from the pandemic, the public deserves 
to know how these policies, good and 
bad, would impact economic growth 
and their livelihoods. 
Since Congressional Democrats are 
insistent in using this legislation to 
push their agenda on social changes 
and climate change, then I urge my 
colleagues to support this amendment, 
as it will tell investors a more com-
plete story. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
claim time in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
strongly oppose Mr. BURGESS’ amend-
ment. This amendment is interesting 
to me because Republicans have, with-
out fail, consistently cited the materi-
ality standard both here on the House 
floor and in the Financial Services 
Committee as a basis to oppose very 
important disclosures. 
Republicans have argued over and 
over again that we do not need to enact 
any new disclosures because companies 
are already required to disclose any 
and all material information. But, with 
this amendment, it seems their pur-
ported commitment to materiality has 
gone out the window so that they can 
bring attention to their massive tax 
cuts for the rich. 
In 2018, when the United States Gov-
ernment should have been focused on 
growing the real economy for Amer-
ican workers, the former President 
pushed forward the largest tax give-
away to our country’s largest corpora-
tions and executives in history. This 
government handout provided corpora-
tions and executives with $2 trillion in 
tax cuts and giveaways, saddling the 
United States Government with debt. 
Make no mistake, these tax cuts did 
not go primarily to workers, but, in-
stead, they went overwhelmingly to 
the top 1 percent. The year after the 
Trump tax cuts were implemented, 
public companies spent nearly $1 tril-
lion in stock buybacks, rather than in-
vesting in research and development, 
increasing worker wages, or shoring up 
their bottom lines to make sure they 
could weather times of crisis. 
According to the Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities, Trump’s tax plan 
gave the top 400 highest income tax-
payers an additional $15 million per 
year. Compare this to the $2.8 million 
the average college graduate will earn 
in their lifetime. 
This amendment absolutely and com-
pletely ignores the harm done to hard-
working Americans and focuses on al-
leged harm to the large corporations. 
This amendment suggests our Nation’s 
largest companies should not be paying 
their fair share, while American work-
ers are forced to pay for Republicans’ 
corporate handouts. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject this amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Look, I am not enthusiastic about 
Congress forcing disclosure of immate-
rial information. But if we are going to 
do it, if we are going to do it, then, at 
the very least, we should be honest. 
And to the extent tax increases are 
going to harm the company’s ability to 
invest in its workers and invest in 
itself, we should disclose that as well. 
Look, there was a time where cor-
porate inversions were a big problem in 
this country. You haven’t heard of cor-
porate inversions since December of 
2017, and the reason was because the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made it unnec-
essary for companies to take their dol-
lars and their jobs overseas. So now 
those dollars and those jobs stay for 
American workers. 
After the passage of the American 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, actual revenues 
to the Treasury rose. And had it not 
been for the imposition of the pan-
demic, those tax cuts would have been 
paid for because the Congressional 
Budget Office assigned a very anemic 
rate of growth to their projections 
when they cited the CBO score prior to 
that bill’s passage. 
This is an important concept. If we 
are going to level immaterial informa-
tion into a company’s disclosures, let’s 
disclose what happens when Congress 
applies additional tax rates to those 
companies as well. It is the right thing 
to do. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
amendment. It is the only thing that 
can make the underlying bill perhaps 
make a little more sense. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS’ amendment is a gim-
mick intended to distract from the im-
portant goals of this package. It in-
sinuates that corporations should not 
be paying their fair share, while hard-
working taxpayers foot the bill. So I 
urge my colleagues to join me in re-
jecting Mr. BURGESS’ amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MRS. AXNE OF 
IOWA 
Add at the end the following: 
TITLE VI—WORKFORCE INVESTMENT 
DISCLOSURE 
SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Workforce 
Investment Disclosure Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 602. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) One of the keys to the 20th century 
post-war economic success of the United 
States was the ability to prepare workers 
over the course of their lives for success 
through multiple sectors across society. Un-
fortunately, during the several decades pre-
ceding the date of enactment of this Act, 
there has been a shift in business norms and 
in society. While Congress recognizes that 
the technology and job skills required for 
some jobs has changed dramatically, the pri-
vate and public partnership to hire workers 
at different education levels and invest in 
them for the long-term is broken. 
(2) Available data from the 10-year period 
preceding the date of enactment of this Act 
suggests that businesses are investing less in 
worker training during that time period, not 
more. 
(3) In the wake of the 2008 global financial 
crisis, there was a well-documented decline 
in overall business investment. That decline 
coincides with the wage polarization of 
workers and an increase in spending on share 
buybacks and dividends, leading several re-
searchers to conclude that companies are de- 
emphasizing investment at the expense of in-
creasing returns for shareholders. The onset 
of a global pandemic may make that trend 
worse, especially with respect to invest-
ments in workers. 
(4) As part of the overall decline in invest-
ment described in paragraph (3), publicly 
traded companies are being provided with in-
centives to prioritize investments in phys-
ical 
assets 
over 
investments 
in 
their 
workforces, meaning that those companies 
are investing in robots instead of individ-
uals. In fact, there are already signs that au-
tomation has increased during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
(5) More than ever, the Federal Govern-
ment, through company disclosure practices, 
needs to understand exactly how companies 
are investing in their workers. Over the sev-
eral months preceding the date of enactment 
of this Act, companies across the United 
States have taken extreme actions to adapt 
and respond to evolving workforce chal-
lenges presented by COVID–19. 
(6) JUST Capital has been tracking the re-
sponses of the Standard and Poor’s 100 larg-
est public companies to their workers and 
has found wide variation in the policies im-
plemented, as well as with respect to the dis-
closure of those policies. Through different 
responses to their workforces, from layoffs 
to workplace safety to paid leave, the 
COVID–19 pandemic is exposing the myriad 
ways that workforce management practices 
of 
companies 
pose 
operational 
and 
reputational risks for short- and long-term 
financial performance. 
(7) Even before the COVID–19 pandemic, 
there was a growing body of research estab-
lishing a relationship between measurable 
workforce management, which is the way 
that companies manage their employees, and 
firm performance. In a study of 2,000 large 
companies, Harvard Law School’s Labor and 
Work Life Program found that forward- 
thinking workforce policies that prioritize 
workers, such as how companies train, re-
tain, and pay their workers, are correlated 
with long-term financial performance. 
(8) Disclosure of workforce management 
policies should be part of a Government-wide 
economic recovery strategy. Just as a set of 
generally accepted accounting principles 
(commonly known as ‘‘GAAP’’) was urgently 
adopted after the Great Depression, stand-
ardized, comparable metrics of workforce 
disclosure requirements in the context of the 
COVID–19 pandemic are critical for investors 
to accurately measure and project company 
performance, both in the present and in the 
future. 
(9) Because many companies already track 
workforce metrics internally, moving to-
wards a transparent disclosure regime would 
allow investors to better judge whether com-
panies are managing risks and making the 
investments in their workforces that are 
needed for long-term growth. 
(10) Businesses increasingly rely on work-
force innovation and intellectual capital for 
competitiveness. Workplace benefits, par-
ticularly paid sick leave, medical leave, and 
flexible work arrangements, critically sup-
port employee mental and physical well- 
being. 
(11) Race- and gender-based workplace dis-
crimination have been tied to negative 
health outcomes, as well as lower produc-
tivity, trust, morale, and satisfaction and 
higher rates of absenteeism and turnover. 
Organizational reporting on practices to re-
duce discrimination can increase employee 
job satisfaction, performance, and engage-
ment. 
(12) According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, work-related stress 
is the leading occupational health risk and, 
per the American Institute of Stress, job 
stress costs United States industry more 
than $300,000,000,000 per year in accidents, ab-
senteeism, employee turnover, diminished 
productivity, and medical, legal, and insur-
ance costs. 
(13) Employee health and well-being is a 
key asset to delivering long-term value, with 
80 percent of public companies that took 
concrete actions on health and well-being 
having seen larger improvements in finan-
cial performance. 
(14) Organizational well-being interven-
tions can create cost savings of up to 10 dol-
lars for every dollar invested. Specifically, 
for every dollar that employers spend on 
workplace disease prevention and well-being 
programs, there is a $3.27 reduction in em-
ployee medical costs and a $2.73 reduction in 
absenteeism costs. Employers that imple-
ment workplace health promotion programs 
have seen reductions in sick leave, health 
plan costs, and workers’ compensation and 
disability insurance costs of approximately 
25 percent. 
(15) The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 
has 
found 
that 
preventable 
chronic conditions are a major contributor 
to insurance premium and employee medical 
claim costs, which are at an all-time high, 
and a Milken Institute study shows that em-
ployers paid $2,600,000,000,000 in 2016 for the 
indirect costs of employee chronic disease 
due to work absences, lost wages, and re-
duced economic productivity. 
(16) The COVID–19 pandemic has severely 
impacted employee physical, mental, and 
emotional well-being by increasing stress, 
depression, burnout, and mortality rates of 
chronic disease and by reducing work-life 
balance and financial security, with these 
challenges likely to persist due to uncer-
tainty and instability even as employees re-
turn to work. Before the COVID–19 pan-
demic, but especially in the face of that pan-
demic, employers that advance policies and 
practices that support workforce health, 
safety, and well-being are likely to out-
perform competitors and benefit from lower 
costs.

Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the amendments en bloc, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this en bloc package of Demo-
cratic amendments to H.R. 1187, the 
Corporate 
Governance 
Improvement 
and Investor Protection Act. 
These amendments include critical 
provisions offered by my colleagues, 
Representative HIMES, Representative 
AXNE, Representative PHILLIPS, Rep-
resentative 
WEXTON, 
Representative 
FRANKEL, and Representative MEEKS. 
These provisions strengthen H.R. 1187 
by requiring public companies to dis-
close key information related to cyber-
security, corporate board diversity, 
human rights abuses, human capital 
management, and the ways companies 
are investing in and protecting their 
workforce. 
Investors, the true owners of public 
companies, need this information be-
cause of the significant effects they 
can have on the bottom lines and oper-
ations of the companies they are in-
vesting their hard-earned money in. In-
vestors need this information to hold 
companies accountable. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support these important 
measures, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendments 
en bloc, and I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, let’s be honest. If 
the original bill wasn’t bad enough, 
Democrats’ en bloc amendments com-
plete the picture. With this amend-
ment, Democrats are packaging even 
more non-investment-relevant social 
priorities that only serve to feed pro-
testers and dissidents with information 
to be used in naming and shaming com-
panies. 
I had mentioned earlier that in some 
of the bills in this package, we have 
some potential impossibility of work-
ing with each other. There are others 
that don’t belong in our committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2851 
June 16, 2021 
Then there are other bills that don’t 
make sense if we really, truly are try-
ing to protect investors from fraud and 
trying to build capital in our country, 
which is the directive of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
Let’s look at some of the specific in-
formation companies would be required 
to disclose under these amendments 
and how it benefits everyday investors. 
Take the workforce and human cap-
ital management disclosure amend-
ment, for example. How exactly is a 
company supposed to measure and dis-
close, in a comprehensible and com-
parable manner, ‘‘employee engage-
ment’’ and ‘‘alignment with business 
strategy’’? 
Additionally, how does disclosing the 
company’s policies relating to ‘‘free-
dom of association and work-life bal-
ance initiatives’’ help everyday inves-
tors evaluate the risks of investing in 
that company? 
My friends on the other side have 
been pretty adamantly opposed to 
Robinhood, but those who are looking 
to use Robinhood might actually like 
that work-life balance. That is kind of 
millennial type of language that is 
being used in here. 
This amendment might as well re-
quire companies to disclose their pol-
icy on dogs in the office and whether 
their canine coworkers are purebreds 
or mixed breed types of rescue dogs. 
This doesn’t have relevance and mate-
riality to investors. 
It is also worth highlighting an 
amendment that requires American 
companies to disclose whether the 
company or an affiliate of the company 
directly or indirectly engaged with an 
entity or the affiliate of an entity re-
garding the importation of not only 
goods from the Xinjiang Uighur Auton-
omous Region but also goods that have 
materials originally sourced from the 
XUAR. 
Well, this is a redo from last Con-
gress, and now that Democrats have 
one-party control, their motives are 
clear. The bill requires companies to 
show if their affiliates are indirectly 
engaged with affiliates of certain com-
panies. 
To put it simply, American compa-
nies would be required to disclose un-
knowable information and face securi-
ties 
fraud 
charges 
for 
any 
misstatements or omissions. 
Now, let’s not have any doubt: This 
side of the aisle has been highlighting 
the Uighur situation for a very long 
time through bills, through amend-
ments, through sanctions, advocating 
those and holding China and the CCP 
responsible. 
But, again, under this legislation, 
they will violate the law for trying to 
disclose unknowable information. 
Why would a company want to go 
public under that regime? And how 
does disclosing such indecipherable in-
formation 
help 
everyday 
investors 
make more informed investment deci-
sions? 
Now, just to make sure my Democrat 
friends don’t twist my words, like I 
said, I very much care about the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s human rights 
abuses. We need to be focused on that. 
I think many of the underlying con-
cerns that motivate this legislation 
and amendment are important. But the 
public company disclosure regime is 
simply the wrong vehicle for address-
ing those concerns. 
The SEC’s mission is to: one, protect 
investors from fraud; two, maintain 
fair, orderly, and efficient markets; 
and, three, facilitate capital formation. 
These packages of bills do not do that, 
and nothing in the SEC’s mission looks 
remotely like enforcing foreign policy 
goals or labor law. 
Mary Jo White had pointed that out 
regarding the conflict minerals portion 
of the Dodd-Frank law. Once again, 
Democrats are more than comfortable 
with shoving the SEC into subject mat-
ter areas where they have zero exper-
tise rather than getting the policy 
right. 
There are real downsides to this ap-
proach my colleagues are taking. Man-
datory disclosure increases compliance 
costs. The more complicated and tech-
nical the information required to be re-
ported in disclosures, the more special-
ized the attorneys and compliance ex-
perts a company needs to adhere to a 
law. 
If I need to spell that out for you, 
that is money that companies cannot 
spend on its workforce and investing in 
their business, in equipment, and in 
their wages, or returning money to ev-
eryday investors who have invested in 
those companies. 
Moreover, just to be clear, because 
my Democrat friends keep talking 
about how badly investors want this 
information, under the disclosure re-
quirements in these amendments, ev-
eryday investors aren’t the ones who 
benefit. Social activists, as well as 
compliance professionals—that is, law-
yers and accountants—are the ones 
who will reap the biggest reward under 
these amendments. 
We are helping the elite workforce 
with the bill and these amendments. 
Instead of helping investors participate 
in our capital markets and helping 
American workers, these amendments 
will leave everyday investors buried in 
disclosures that are, at most, tangen-
tially related to investment. 
Meanwhile, smaller public companies 
with shoestring compliance budgets 
will have to delay raising wages for 
workers in order to reallocate that cap-
ital to hiring more lawyers. 
At its core, this amendment just 
heightens the key problem with the 
original bill. The additional disclosures 
will disincentivize private companies 
from going public, which will inhibit 
everyday investors, our constituents, 
from participating in our capital mar-
kets and will limit their choices of 
public companies to invest in. 
Let’s not eliminate access and oppor-
tunities to everyday investors, espe-
cially when rich investors will still 
have access to investing in companies 
that have gone private or stayed pri-
vate in response to these amendments. 
I think that is one of the things, 
Madam Speaker, that is getting lost in 
this. Those that have will continue to 
have those options. Those that are try-
ing to build a future are going to get 
frozen out once again. 
For that reason, I oppose this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. AXNE). 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, in the 
last century, businesses have become 
much less reliant on physical assets 
and more reliant on their workers. 
In fact, virtually every business that 
I talk to says that the people are their 
most important asset. Yet, we have 
minimal information about the em-
ployees and what we are doing to in-
vest in our workers. 
My amendment would address that 
by giving us more information from 
public 
companies 
about 
workforce 
training, pay, benefits, health and safe-
ty, and turnover and promotion rates. 
By the way, these are sets of data that 
are already being collected by most 
public companies. 
The pandemic, though, has only driv-
en home how important it is for com-
panies to make sure that their workers 
stay safe and healthy for their com-
pany’s success. It is obvious that com-
panies with workers who are more en-
gaged and invested will do better, 
which is why investors want this infor-
mation. 
My amendment would encourage bet-
ter corporate practices by giving inves-
tors and the public the information 
they want about which companies are 
truly investing in their workers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS). 
Mr. 
MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Chairwoman WATERS
for her 
leadership on the Financial Services 
Committee. 
Today, I urge bipartisan support for 
H.R. 1187, including the passage of my 
amendment, the Improving Corporate 
Governance Through Diversity Act. 
As we continue these conversations 
about equity and closing the racial 
wealth gap, this amendment is a key 
component because it will empower in-
vestors with better data to drive diver-
sity efforts in corporate America. This 
is precisely because investors recognize 
that profit, performance, and inclusive 
governance are logically intertwined. 
That is why my amendment, which I 
want to thank Representative MALO-
NEY
and Representative TORRES
for 
working with me on, seeks to enhance 
the SEC’s current diversity disclosure 
regime by requiring public companies 
to disclose race, ethnicity, gender iden-
tity, sexual orientation, and veteran

status on the boards and in the C- 
suites. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New York. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, the 
American economy cannot reach its 
full potential without fully redressing 
persistent barriers that have kept 
whole communities from being able to 
build wealth and share in opportunities 
of prosperity. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive WATERS for her leadership on this 
issue. 
Madam Speaker, I want to highlight 
some language in this en bloc amend-
ment that is very important to the 
working women of this country. The 
provision requires publicly traded com-
panies to disclose the number and mon-
etary amounts of settlements and judg-
ments in connection with workplace 
harassment claims. 
This will not only improve trans-
parency and accountability for public 
companies, but it will provide incen-
tives for them to foster respectful, safe 
workplaces free from harassment and 
to make sure that there are con-
sequences 
when 
workplace 
abuses 
occur. 
Here is the thing. Up to 80 percent of 
women have experienced some form of 
workplace harassment, and there are 
serious implications that often result: 
physical and mental health problems, 
career interruptions, and lower earn-
ings. Enduring this kind of harassment 
at work can even discourage women 
from advancing their careers, which 
only makes the gender wage gap worse. 
All persons must have safe work-
places to reach their full potential, and 
investors should know more about the 
workplaces they are putting their 
money behind. Transparency should 
add motivation to employers to keep 
their employees safe, and that is good 
for everyone. 
b 1400 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
Madam Speaker, this was claimed 
earlier by one of the authors that in-
vestors wanted this information, I be-
lieve was the quote. 
Well, I ask the question: If investors 
want this information, as claimed, 
then they can bring a vote to the 
shareholders to require these disclo-
sures. 
Evidence, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
would dictate and show that precious 
few of these types of issues have actu-
ally been brought to shareholder meet-
ings, where they are voted on. In the 
rare times that they have, even fewer 
have actually been approved. 
So, no, investors don’t look at this 
information. They don’t want this in-
formation, and they don’t view it as 
material to the investment decisions 
that they are making. 
So you have to ask the question, 
then: Who is requiring or requesting 
this information? I suspect it is more 
about appeasing social activists. It is 
not about the workers and it is cer-
tainly not about the investors. This is 
about making sure that the virtue sig-
naling that is required in today’s cor-
porate world—may I add, for large cor-
porations, because there are plenty of 
small and medium-sized, even publicly 
traded companies that are bucking 
this. 
But for these large corporations who 
have massive, massive compliance de-
partments that are chock-full of attor-
neys, chock-full of CPAs and others 
that are going to work through this, 
and they are going to hire their friends 
in the consulting world to make sure 
that they are dotting the I’s and cross-
ing the T’s, that is who it is really 
about. 
Sadly, unfortunately, who ultimately 
ends up losing in that equation is the 
worker and the investor, our constitu-
ents. 
Madam Speaker, with that, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
standing up for our Nation’s investors 
and workers to vote ‘‘yes’’ for these 
Democratic amendments. 
I do believe that Mr. HUIZENGA cor-
rectly described who they are working 
for. He just talked about how big these 
corporations are and how much they 
have to manage. 
Of course, prior to him, Mr. BURGESS 
talked about, yes, the tax breaks that 
they receive, and they should receive 
more tax breaks. However, they are 
worried about these corporations and 
their ability to comply, despite the 
fact they have all of the accountants 
they need, they have all of the per-
sonnel they need, they have all of the 
management they need. They have ev-
erything that they need to be in com-
pliance. 
We are simply saying it is time for 
them to disclose information that the 
investors have been asking and begging 
for. 
And, of course, they often refer to 
the retail investors. But the institu-
tional investors must be included in 
this decision because they are the ones 
that are in control of the teachers and 
the firefighters and the workers on the 
front lines and all of that money that 
they are investing for them, and they 
have got to protect them. The way that 
you protect them is making sure that 
the investors understand how to make 
good decisions based on information. 
If the big corporations, with all that 
they have to be able to operate, do not 
give them this information, do not 
have this information, do not share 
this information, they are at a great 
disadvantage. 
And so I would simply ask my col-
leagues to understand whose side we 
are on. We are on the side of the retail 
investors and the institutional inves-
tors who are handling all of the money 
of our frontline workers who are in-
vesting for their retirement. 
I would ask for a ‘‘yea’’ vote on these 
en bloc amendments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2853 
June 16, 2021 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, as I noted in 
our debate earlier today, I stand in op-
position to the legislation en bloc of-
fered by the majority, and that is why 
I am offering an amendment that re-
places the entire underlying bill with a 
study to be conducted by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
The amendment would require the 
SEC to summarize and describe any in-
consistencies in the methodologies re-
lated to environmental, social, and 
governance metrics before—repeat, be-
fore—they mandate any type of disclo-
sure from public companies. 
My amendment will provide us with 
much-needed information on the dif-
ferences between the five or six stand-
ard setters, among many others, cur-
rently in the market. They all have dif-
ferent approaches and ways to measure 
climate and other ESG risks. This 
causes confusion, Mr. Speaker, and tur-
moil, both for the public companies 
trying to determine these metrics and 
issue their financials and for investors 
trying to understand what has been 
disclosed. 
As we have discussed during the gen-
eral debate, H.R. 1187 is a compilation 
of five different bills. During this 
amendment debate, I want to focus 
particularly on the bills offered by the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
VARGAS) and the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. CASTEN). 
When we marked these bills up in the 
Financial Services Committee, I point-
ed out that even though Democrats be-
lieve these bills are in alignment, as 
they both address the need for climate- 
related disclosure, they are in tension 
with one another. 
For example, Congressman VARGAS’ 
bill suggests that a disclosure system 
is sufficient by providing an annual re-
port describing the long-term ESG 
strategy 
and 
ESG-related 
metrics, 
which presumably would include cli-
mate risk. 
On the other hand, Congressman 
CASTEN says that a disclosure should 
report the same metrics, but addition-
ally needs to disclose the social and 
human impact of a company’s actions, 
analyze how the company’s reputation 
might be affected by climate, detail 
the board’s oversight, and has a long 
list of statutory additions. 
The Democrats often say that we 
need to mandate measuring climate 
risk 
because 
this 
is 
science. 
But 
Deloitte 
& 
Touche 
reported 
that 
science has not agreed on the method-
ology for measuring climate risks, and 
even when companies try to measure 
these risks, the information isn’t meas-
ured consistently, timely, and in a rel-
evant way, increasing uncertainty. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I strong-
ly oppose the amendment offered by 
Mr. HILL. This amendment would gut 
the entirety of H.R. 1187. Bizarrely, 
this amendment offered by my col-
league has an odd focus on climate 
change, suggesting that we need more 
study about the financial risk of cli-
mate change. Let me be very clear: cli-
mate change is real. We cannot alter 
the Earth’s orbit or the Moon’s orbit or 
click our heels three times and wish for 
climate change to magically disappear. 
In fact, the impacts of climate 
change are already apparent and are af-
fecting global financial markets. Un-
fortunately, studies show that market 
prices currently fail to factor in the 
risks of climate change to the tune of 
trillions of dollars. 
Mr. HILL’s amendment would also 
allow companies to continue to engage 
in legally risky tax-avoidance schemes 
to funnel limitless amounts of cor-
porate dark money into politics and to 
enrich CEOs while worker wages re-
main stagnant. This is precisely the in-
formation that investors want to know 
about the companies that they own. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
amendment. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, we are not in 
Kansas anymore, since we are using 
‘‘Wizard of Oz’’ analogies. To put a 
finer point on it, we are not debating 
climate. We are debating the right way 
to disclose financial risk for climate, 
from climate. 
To put a finer point on it, a report re-
leased by the Governance & Account-
ability Institute features a breakdown 
of all the Standard & Poor’s 500 pub-
licly traded companies that are cur-
rently disclosing climate risk and 
which standard setter they are using. 
The outcome shows that 51 percent 
use one company, 14 percent use an-
other, and 5 percent use another. Vast-
ly different outcomes. And, in fact, the 
bill proposed by the majority dictates 
which one of those should be used, and 
it happens to be the one that only 5 
percent of companies are currently 
using. 
So there are five or six of these dif-
ferent standard setters out there, and 
it is important for the commission to 
figure out which one of these makes 
the most sense before we mandate in a 
rulemaking. 
Bogging down these companies with 
additional, unclear, unwieldy disclo-
sures just to prove a political point is 
not just unfair, it is expensive. It leads 
to increased litigation risk and hurts 
long-term capital formation. This is 
not how we should be operating as pol-
icymakers and precisely why I am of-
fering this amendment to get the work 
done right up front before it turns into 
another government mandate. 
My amendment is simply good gov-
ernance. It will replace the bill with a 
study of all disclosure frameworks re-
lated to the environment, social and 
governance metrics, as well as those 
particularly related to climate that 
any public company may use when 
making disclosures to our investors, 
whether voluntarily or pursuant to a 
statute. And it would analyze the dif-
ferences and conflicting factors be-
tween the reporting frameworks. This 
information is what we need in Con-
gress, and we should be able to review 
it before drafting, let alone voting on 
legislation that will lead to a man-
dated new disclosure framework. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment is sim-
ply good governance that will replace 
the bill with a study, and I believe that 
is the right way to go. I urge my col-
leagues to support this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. HILL’s amendment would com-
pletely gut H.R. 1187 and would prevent 
investors from accessing critical envi-
ronmental, social, and governance in-
formation that they need to make the 
best investment decisions possible and 
hold the companies they own account-
able. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
Mr. HILL’s amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 473, the pre-

(B) recommendations with respect to small 
business compliance with such disclosure re-
quirements. 
(b) DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘small business’’ has the 
meaning given the term ‘‘small business con-
cern’’ under section 3 of the Small Business 
Act (15 U.S.C. 632). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 473, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
SCHRIER) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment to this 
bill is very simple. It would ensure that 
this important legislation does not 
place undue burden on small busi-
nesses. 
In so many areas throughout my dis-
trict, our Main Street businesses are 
just now finally getting back on their 
feet. They have faced unprecedented 
challenges during this past pandemic 
year. In fact, one small business owner 
in Auburn almost didn’t apply for any 
Federal financial assistance because 
she was so overwhelmed by the poten-
tial paperwork. 
Even before the pandemic, small 
businesses were bogged down with pa-
perwork and administrative burdens, 
things that can be easily handled by a 
large corporation but that really are 
too much of a burden and can put a 
Main Street shop out of business. 
When we implement this legislation, 
we should also understand what effect 
it will have on small businesses and 
make it as easy as possible for them to 
disclose this important information. 
That is why my amendment requires 
the 
Sustainable 
Finance 
Advisory 
Commission to study issues small busi-
nesses may face when complying with 
requirements of this bill and order rec-
ommendations to ease regulatory bur-
dens for these businesses. 
As we move forward in creating 
transparency for large corporations, it 
is important that we do so without cre-
ating burdens that could really hamper 
the recovery of small businesses. 
This is a commonsense amendment, 
and I urge my colleagues to support its 
adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to this amend-
ment, although I am not opposed to it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Michi-
gan is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the goals of this amendment, 
and I applaud my colleague from Wash-
ington. We should be concerned about 
the effects of this bill and ESG report-
ing on small businesses, and I would 
say that this is a step in the right di-
rection. 
However, I don’t believe this amend-
ment actually goes far enough. The 
ranking member of the full committee 
submitted an amendment to the Rules 
Committee that would have exempted 
small businesses from the onerous and 
unnecessary requirements of this bill, 
and, sadly, that amendment was not 
made in order. I think that may have 
achieved the same goal in a certainly 
much more clear manner for the au-
thor. 
This bill will be particularly burden-
some on small businesses that don’t 
have the resources to pay all the ex-
penses associated with complying with 
these disclosures, such as lawyers, ac-
countants, and other ESG consultants. 
I know the chairwoman had men-
tioned that somehow my statements 
earlier and the statements of my col-
leagues were supportive of large busi-
ness and their support of this. It is ac-
tually the exact opposite. I could really 
care less what the Fortune 50 think 
about this. 
I am concerned about that bottom 50. 
I am worried about those up-and-com-
ing companies that are going to have 
those precious resources sucked into 
more compliance that, again, does not 
have relevance or materiality to inves-
tors, nor is it actually requested by in-
vestors. 
But this bill is a prime example of 
Wall Street versus Main Street, and I 
commend my colleague for fighting for 
Main Street with this amendment. 
I am prepared to accept this amend-
ment because I hope it will help small 
businesses. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for his commendation on 
the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS), the chairwoman of the House 
Committee on Financial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment offered by Representative 
SCHRIER requires the SEC to work with 
the Office of the Advocate for Small 
Business Capital Formation and the Of-
fice of the Investor Advocate to study 
the issues smaller public companies 
may face in reporting ESG disclosures, 
and to make recommendations for the 
SEC to consider. 
Disclosures of ESG-related matters 
are critical to investors in markets, 
and it is imperative that public compa-
nies provide investors, the true owners 
of these companies, with this impor-
tant information. However, it is just as 
important for us to ensure that public 
companies of all sizes are able to com-
ply with these disclosure requirements. 
To address this, my colleague, Rep-
resentative SCHRIER, has introduced an 
amendment that requires the SEC to 
work with the Office of the Advocate 
for Small Business Capital Formation 
and the Office of the Investor Advocate 
to study the issues that smaller public 
companies face in disclosing ESG mat-
ters, and to make recommendations for 
the SEC to tailor these disclosure re-
quirements to assist smaller public 
companies. 
Ms. 
SCHRIER’s 
amendment, 
along 
with Mr. VARGAS’ provision in H.R. 
1187, will help smaller public compa-
nies by ensuring that the SEC is fac-
toring in the unique issues that small-
er public companies face while also cre-
ating 
clear, 
consistent 
regulatory 
standards that reduce regulatory un-
certainty, all while providing investors 
and markets with this critical informa-
tion. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to support this amendment, and I 
am happy to accept it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment that is a commonsense amend-
ment to support our local small busi-
nesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 473, the pre-
vious 
question 
is

the

woman

printed in House Report 117–59. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-

will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield

I rise in support of this amendment. 
This amendment proposes a technical 
change in title 5 of this bill, the Disclo-
sure of Tax Havens and Offshoring Act, 
to simply clarify that a ‘‘tax jurisdic-
tion’’ includes either a country or a ju-
risdiction that is not a country but has 
fiscal autonomy. 
My concern, as the bill presently 
states, is that certain words used in 
that part of the bill will be highly

June 16, 2021 
problematic to U.S. territories, includ-
ing my district, and our efforts to ad-
dress very important tax policy issues 
that have arisen in the last few years. 
My amendment seeks to correct the 
bill’s definition of a tax jurisdiction by 
removing its words explicitly analyzing 
U.S. territories without the United 
States. While these specific words sepa-
rating the territories from the rest of 
the United States would be removed, 
the rest of the language would be left 
as it currently exists in the bill: A ‘‘tax 
jurisdiction’’ would mean either a 
country or a jurisdiction that is not a 
country but that has fiscal autonomy. 
My concern is with the language to 
explicitly distinguish U.S. territories 
from the sovereign United States in 
such a way. 
First, it would be inconsistent with 
the current structure of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, which this bill 
seeks to amend. Under that law, each 
of the U.S. territories are defined and 
treated as States. 
Secondly, it would be contrary to the 
position that the United States has 
taken in its deliberations with the Eu-
ropean Union and the OECD in re-
sponse to blacklisting of U.S. terri-
tories in 2017 and 2018. 
A letter from the Secretary of Treas-
ury to the Council of the European 
Union addressing this issue reads: ‘‘The 
United States disagrees with the Coun-
cil’s decision to consider U.S. terri-
tories 
separately 
from 
the 
United 
States.’’ 
It would be more difficult for the 
United States to make this argument if 
legislation is adopted by Congress lend-
ing credence to the argument that U.S. 
territories should be treated as tax ju-
risdictions without the United States 
as a whole. 
Importantly, treating the U.S. terri-
tories as separate tax jurisdictions dis-
tinct from the sovereign United States 
would also be inconsistent with efforts 
that U.S. territories have been making 
for relief from tax increases intended 
for foreign tax jurisdictions that were 
unfairly imposed on U.S. territories by 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Lastly, I have concerns about the 
language at issue categorizing U.S. ter-
ritories as fiscally autonomous. They 
are, in fact, legally possessions of the 
United States under the tax code to 
this day. One of the U.S. territories is 
currently in a state of bankruptcy. The 
U.S. Virgin Islands has no control over 
its income taxes and cannot sever itself 
from the mirror code tax system of the 
United States, and has extensive and 
longstanding written agreements in 
place with the IRS requiring exchange 
of tax information. 
Thus, all I have requested with this 
technical amendment is that the bill 
language be slightly adjusted to re-
move words explicitly referencing U.S. 
territories as tax jurisdictions distinct 
from the sovereign United States. I be-
lieve this would be more fair to the 
sponsors of this measure because it 
would in no way impede the effect of 
its policy; the meaning of tax jurisdic-
tion would remain as either a country 
or ‘‘a jurisdiction that is not a country 
but has fiscal autonomy.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS), the chairwoman 
of the Financial Services Committee. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I under-
stand that my friend and colleague, 
Ms. PLASKETT, has raised some con-
cerns about the treatment of terri-
tories in this bill, and I want to assure 
her that the staff has done everything 
possible in the bill text to ensure that 
territories are included in this bill and 
not treated disparately. 
The language in this bill is con-
sistent with regulations promulgated 
under the Obama administration re-
garding country-by-country tax report-
ing, which were carefully written to 
ensure territories were not excluded. 
I want to make clear that nothing in 
this bill should be intended to suggest 
that territories are tax havens. In fact, 
I have worked with my colleague, Mr. 
SAN NICOLAS, on this bill text. We be-
lieve that the enhanced disclosures in 
this bill, which will include territories, 
should help encourage investment in 
the territories and hold corporations 
accountable for lack of investment in 
territories. 
I want to ensure Ms. PLASKETT that I 
take her concerns seriously, and I in-
tend to work with her to make sure 
that what she is identifying as perhaps 
incorrectly being defined as tax havens 
is an issue that I will deal with. 
b 1430 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, since I 
have assurances from both the chair-
woman and the committee that they 
will continue to work with us to ensure 
that U.S. territories are not treated as 
tax havens but that we are, in fact, in-
dividuals who intend and continue to 
intend, through our governments, to 
pay our taxes to the Internal Revenue 
Service and continue to be treated eq-
uitably as part of the United States, at 
this time, I yield back the balance of 
my time and I withdraw my amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
amendment is withdrawn. 
Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration of H.R. 1187 is 
postponed.

ACT 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I

for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 479 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (S. 475) to amend title 5, 
United States Code, to designate Juneteenth 
National Independence Day as a legal public 
holiday. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform or their respective 
designees; and (2) one motion to commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time is yielded for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, today, 
the Committee on Rules met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 479, 
providing for consideration of S. 475, 
the Juneteenth National Independence 
Day Act, under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form and one motion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
consider an important and timely bill, 
S. 475, which parallels H.R. 1320 intro-
duced by our colleague, SHEILA JACK-
SON LEE from Texas. This bill would 
make Juneteenth a Federal holiday. 
We are happy and not a little sur-
prised to see that the Senate was able 
to quickly pass this bill with unani-
mous consent. It is not every day that 
one sees the Senate move more quickly 
than the House, and it is my hope that 
today the House of Representatives 
would be able to act with similar swift-
ness. 
Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June 
19th, celebrates a seminal moment in 
Black American history, and it is well 
past time that our country recognizes 
the importance of this day by making 
it a Federal holiday. 
While the Emancipation Proclama-
tion outlawed slavery in the South, 
and the Civil War effectively ended 
with the surrender of the Confederacy 
in April of 1865 at Appomattox, slavery 
did not immediately end throughout 
the United States. 
During 
the 
Civil 
War, 
many 
slaveholders migrated to Texas to 
avoid conflict and continued to hold 
Black Americans in bondage after the 
formal end of the Civil War. 
On June 19, 1865, Union troops finally 
arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, to en-
sure that slaves were freed, a full 21⁄2

June 16, 2021 
years after the Emancipation Procla-
mation was signed by President Lin-
coln. 
On that date, Major General Gordon 
Granger issued General Order No. 3, 
which announced that, in accordance 
with the Emancipation Proclamation, 
all slaves are free. 
In the years following, Black Texans 
began to celebrate Juneteenth, also 
known as Emancipation Day, Jubilee 
Day, 
and 
Juneteenth 
Independence 
Day. Over time, they developed time- 
honored traditions for celebration, in-
cluding parades, cookouts, family re-
unions, prayer gatherings, historic and 
cultural readings, and musical per-
formances. As Texans emigrated to 
other parts of the United States, those 
traditions came with them and became 
enshrined in Black communities across 
our country. 
Today, Juneteenth is celebrated by 
communities throughout the United 
States. Forty-eight States and the Dis-
trict 
of 
Columbia 
recognize 
Juneteenth. It is time for the Federal 
Government to do the same. 
My own district in southeastern 
Pennsylvania takes great pride in its 
Juneteenth celebrations. From parades 
and flag raisings and picnics to musical 
performances and community gath-
erings, our community will celebrate 
at dozens of events throughout the dis-
trict this weekend. 
On a planning call this week for one 
of our local celebrations, a resident 
from the Eastwick neighborhood in 
southwest 
Philadelphia 
proclaimed 
that ‘‘Juneteenth is the holy grail’’ of 
celebrations for the community be-
cause it represents America’s true day 
of freedom. 
Upon hearing the news that this bill 
would come up for passage today, one 
of my staffers said: ‘‘As an African- 
American woman raising five beautiful 
children, it would mean so much to 
make Juneteenth a Federal holiday. 
. . . It allows people to reflect on what 
my ancestors had to deal with. It gives 
the history of how they fought and con-
tinued to fight as they passed the torch 
on to the next generation.’’ 
Another community member just 
shared: ‘‘I hope this provides an acces-
sible, teachable moment so people 
across the country can talk with their 
neighbors about why we need this holi-
day and how it helps to address the 
erasure of Black contributions to hu-
manity and history.’’ 
I know that this move to make 
Juneteenth a Federal holiday will 
mean so much to members of the Black 
community in my district, and I am so 
excited to have the great honor of re-
turning home to celebrate this week-
end after we pass this bill. 
Juneteenth, like many of our other 
Federal celebrations, serves as a day of 
remembrance and reflection and a cele-
bration of emancipation and freedom. 
So, as we consider the rule today, 
and 
as 
we 
approach 
this 
year’s 
Juneteenth celebrations, I ask my col-
leagues in this Chamber to think and 
reflect on our Nation’s complicated 
history, the events that led us to where 
we are, and what we need to do to reck-
on with our past and continue to work 
toward creating a more equitable and 
inclusive society. 
America has historically failed to 
fully address the horrors of the abuse 
wrought upon enslaved people during 
the early years of our country, and to 
this day, we live with the long-term ef-
fects and consequences of slavery in 
America. 
Racism, both interpersonal and insti-
tutional, continues to plague our coun-
try. And despite monumental efforts, 
from the Civil War to the civil rights 
movement and beyond, to get our Na-
tion to live up to the ideals proclaimed 
in the Declaration of Independence, 
Black Americans still face disparate 
treatment 
and 
disparate 
outcomes 
across our society, from housing and 
healthcare to education and the work-
place. 
To move forward with the work of 
dismantling institutional racism that 
continues 
to 
disenfranchise 
Black 
Americans, it is essential that we start 
by looking critically at how we get 
here. 
If we all truly commit ourselves to 
striving toward a more perfect Union, 
where all people are not only legally 
equal but actually have a fair shot at 
achieving the American Dream, we 
must recognize our current failings and 
take the necessary steps to end racial 
discrimination, the racial wealth gap, 
and racial injustices in our social, eco-
nomic, environmental, and judicial in-
stitutions. 
While some may feel that making 
Juneteenth a Federal holiday is a pure-
ly symbolic act, symbols hold power. 
Holidays hold power. 
While millions of Americans already 
celebrate Juneteenth and use the day 
to reflect on our collective past and fu-
ture, this is an important step to for-
mally commemorate a crucial part of 
our culture and history that for too 
long has been canceled. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on other meaningful steps 
we can take to honor the legacy of 
enslaved people who contributed so 
much to our history and to address the 
lasting impacts of this cruel chapter in 
our history that still persist today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the distinguished gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCAN-
LON) for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
provides for consideration of S. 475, a 
bipartisan bill establishing a national 
holiday 
on 
June 
19, 
known 
as 
Juneteenth 
National 
Independence 
Day. The June 19th date marks the 
date 
that 
Major 
General 
Gordon 
Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, 
and announced the end of slavery and 
the Civil War. 
I am honored to stand here with my 
colleague from Pennsylvania as the 
Battle of Gettysburg, of course, took 
place in Pennsylvania, involving the 
largest number of Civil War casualties, 
and marked the turning point of the 
war. 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Keystone 
State played a crucial part in the Civil 
War. My State provided over 350,000 
soldiers and sailors, more than any 
other Northern State except New York. 
Pennsylvania also served as a vital re-
source for military equipment and food 
for the Union Army. As I already men-
tioned, the Commonwealth was the site 
of the world’s largest battle, that of 
Gettysburg. 
So, it probably comes as no surprise 
that Pennsylvania already recognizes 
Juneteenth. In fact, since 1980, 47 
States, including, as I said, my home 
State of Pennsylvania, as well as the 
District of Columbia, have issued legis-
lation recognizing Juneteenth as a hol-
iday or as a day of observance. 
Designating June 19 as a national 
holiday would increase awareness and 
education on Juneteenth; it would cele-
brate Black history and culture; and it 
would recognize the Americans who 
fought and died to end slavery. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I now 
recognize my distinguished colleague, 
the chairwoman of the Subcommittee 
on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland 
Security in the House Committee on 
the Judiciary. Representative SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE is a tremendous advocate 
and leader in the fight for racial equity 
and an inspiration to many of our col-
leagues, including myself. Coming from 
the great State of Texas, she is all too 
familiar with the history and impor-
tance of Juneteenth for African Ameri-
cans and for all Americans to recognize 
and reconcile our history. 
In Congress’ past, Representative 
JACKSON LEE led the charge to recog-
nize Juneteenth as a national holiday 
by introducing legislation to federally 
recognize this historic day. In the 117th 
Congress, she, again, introduced H.R. 
1320, which I understand formed the 
basis for the Senate bill. 
Through the tireless work of her and 
her Senate colleagues, we now have the 
privilege of voting on this historic leg-
islation. I applaud the tremendous 
work of the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. How humbled I 
am to be on the floor of the House with 
fellow Americans who can speak elo-
quently about the history that is so 
deeply seated in my history and the 
history of so many Americans. 
How honored I am, Congresswoman 
SCANLON, that you come from the great 
State of Pennsylvania that has a sto-
ried history. For some of us, we re-
member Gettysburg, but there are 
many other aspects, which I have had 
the privilege of visiting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2857 
June 16, 2021 
I always say to America: Learn 
America. It is a beautiful place, but it 
is a historic place. 
To my friend from Pennsylvania, the 
manager and Rules Committee mem-
ber, how honored I am to have you, a 
fellow Pennsylvanian, in terms of the 
minority’s 
manager, 
on 
the 
floor 
today. You know full well the fight of 
the Union soldiers, and I am sure that 
you have in your constituency or in 
the State descendants of those fights. 
Mr. Speaker, I can stand here today 
to say, with Senator MARKEY, Senator 
CORNYN, Senator SMITH, and my col-
league of long-suffering, DANNY DAVIS, 
who began this journey with me, the 
act or the thought of racial divide 
crushes to the floor on this bright and 
sunny day as we bring from the Senate 
the legislation that I offered, H.R. 1320, 
in the form of S. 475, the Juneteenth 
National Independence Day Act, com-
panion legislation to H.R. 1320 in the 
House. 
The House was the leader, although I 
am always glad to embrace the dy-
namic leadership of the Senate. We 
have over 160 more sponsors coming, 
bipartisan sponsors. 
My good friend and colleague from 
Texas, RANDY
WEBER, actually rep-
resents Galveston, and I want to share 
his name on the floor. 
b 1445 
But 
I 
introduce 
this 
to 
make 
Juneteenth a Federal holiday to com-
memorate the end of chattel slavery, 
America’s original sin, and to bring 
about celebration, crushing racial di-
vide down to a point of unity to this 
Earth, and it is because of the perse-
verance, the strength of our mutual 
communities, African Americans that 
struggle for equality. 
Now, I would be remiss if I did not at 
least appoint that slavery was real. 
These are the brutal backs upon which 
the whip went over and over and over 
again, not only men, women, children, 
possibly, as history recounts. 
The history is limited because it is 
slave narrative, that I might very hum-
bly and respectfully say, those stories 
are in broken English. But I remember 
one where a woman slave said to a hus-
band that had been either taken away 
or had been a freed slave to another 
plantation; she said, Husband, come 
back, come back, they are about to sell 
me and your children to different 
places. That is what this moment in 
time in history represents for us. 
But look where we are today. Look 
where we are. In the midst of what peo-
ple have described as racial divide, we 
have now come to a place where we ac-
knowledge the 47 States that have done 
a celebratory, unified, and multicul-
tural celebration of Juneteenth. Let 
me tell you why, just for a moment. 
Juneteenth is as significant to Afri-
can Americans as it will be to Ameri-
cans because we, too, are Americans, 
and it means freedom. 
Juneteenth. On June 19, 1865, General 
Granger found himself on the shores of 
Galveston—Senator CORNYN and myself 
will 
be 
in 
Galveston 
this 
very 
Juneteenth. How coincidental. Can you 
imagine, how short I am, I will be 
standing maybe taller than Senator 
CORNYN, forgive me for that, because it 
will be such an elevation of joy, but we 
will be there for a historic celebration. 
But Juneteenth came in June of 1865, 
and shortly thereafter, in the next few 
months, the 13th Amendment declared 
slavery unconstitutional in the United 
States. I think it is important to read 
these words. These are the words of 
General Granger, coming all the way 
from Washington, D.C., of General 
Order No. 3. 
You know, we like legislation, but I 
will tell you, can you imagine all of the 
slaves who were not free 2 extra years? 
They gathered around, they knew 
something was happening. There was 
no telegram and there was no cyber, 
there was no email or tweets. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
people of Texas are informed that, in 
accordance with a proclamation from 
the Executive of the United States, all 
slaves are free. This involves an abso-
lute equality of rights and rights of 
property between former masters and 
slaves, and the connection therefore 
existing between them becomes that of 
employer and hired labor. It is a day of 
freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
Rules Committee, Chairman MCGOV-
ERN, and Ranking Member COLE. I want 
to thank them for their commitment 
in bringing this to us. I want to thank 
Majority 
Leader 
HOYER, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, the whip, Mr. CLYBURN, the 
chairman, Mr. JEFFRIES, and all of the 
leadership on both sides of the aisle 
that have brought us to this point. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
House Judiciary Committee, the Chair of the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Crime, 
Terrorism, 
and 
Homeland Security, and the principal sponsor 
in the House of the Juneteenth National Inde-
pendence Day Act, I rise in strong and enthu-
siastic support of the Rule and the underlying 
legislation, S. 475, the Senate companion to 
the Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act, which establishes June 19 as a federal 
holiday. 
I applaud the U.S. Senate for passing S. 
475, Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act, companion legislation to H.R. 1320, which 
I introduced to make Juneteenth a federal holi-
day to commemorate the end of chattel slav-
ery, America’s Original Sin, and to celebrate 
the perseverance that has been the hallmark 
of the African American struggle for equality. 
I thank Senator MARKEY of Massachusetts, 
my senior senator, Senator JOHN CORNYN of 
Texas, and others who spearheaded this effort 
in the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader 
SCHUMER for his support and for using his leg-
islative skills to ensure the bill was voted on 
and passed. 
Mr. Speaker, now it is time for the House of 
Representatives to act swiftly and bring to the 
floor, vote on, pass the Juneteenth National 
Independence Day Act, and send it to the 
desk of President Biden for signature. 
With the President’s signature, the federal 
government will join 47 states in recognizing 
as a holiday Juneteenth, the day that has 
been celebrated by African Americans for 156 
years and has been called rightly as ’Amer-
ica’s second Independence Day.’ 
Let me extend on behalf of all of us who 
have labored to pass this important legislation 
our deep appreciation to the House leader-
ship, particularly Majority Leader Hoyer, for 
their support which paved the way for the 
House last year to pass by unanimous con-
sent H. Res. 1001, the resolution I introduced 
recognizing Juneteenth Independence Day. 
As I have said many times, Juneteenth is as 
significant to African Americans as July 4 is to 
all Americans because on that day, June 19, 
155 years ago, General Gordon Granger, the 
Commanding Officer of the District of Texas, 
rode into Galveston, Texas and announced 
the freedom of the last American slaves; belat-
edly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly 
two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln 
signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
When General Granger read these words of 
General Order No. 3 set off joyous celebra-
tions of the freedmen and women of Texas: 
‘‘The people of Texas are informed that in 
accordance with a Proclamation from the Ex-
ecutive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
rights and rights of property between former 
masters and slaves, and the connection there-
fore existing between them becomes that be-
tween employer and hired laborer.’’ 
Juneteenth thus made real to the last per-
sons living under the system of chattel slav-
ery, of human bondage, the prophetic words 
of President Abraham Lincoln delivered No-
vember 19, 1863, at Gettysburg ‘‘that this na-
tion, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom—and that government of the people, 
by the people, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earth.’’ 
Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas 
state capital in 1867 under the direction of the 
Freedmen’s Bureau and remains the oldest 
known celebration of slavery’s demise, com-
memorating freedom while acknowledging the 
sacrifices and contributions made by coura-
geous African Americans towards making our 
great nation the more conscious and accept-
ing country that it has become. 
Juneteenth is as significant to African Amer-
icans as July 4 is to all Americans because on

known celebration of slavery’s demise. It com-
memorates freedom while acknowledging the 
sacrifices and contributions made by coura-
geous African Americans towards making our 
great nation the more conscious and accept-
ing country that it has become. 
As the nation prepares to celebrate July 4th, 
our nation’s independence day, it is a time to 
reflect on the accomplishments of our nation 
and its people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2858 
June 16, 2021 
General Granger’s reading of this order 
ended chattel slavery, a form of perpetual ser-
vitude that held generations of Africans in 
bondage in the United States for two-hundred 
and forty-eight years and opened a new chap-
ter in American history. 
Recognizing the importance of this date, 
former slaves coined the word ‘‘Juneteenth’’ to 
mark the occasion with a celebrations the first 
of which occurred in the Texas state capital in 
1867 under the direction of the Freedmen’s 
Bureau. 
Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of 
freedom for people who did not have it. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of slavery’s demise. 
It commemorates freedom while acknowl-
edging the sacrifices and contributions made 
by courageous African Americans towards 
making our great nation the more conscious 
and accepting country that it has become. 
The celebration of Juneteenth followed the 
most devastating conflict in our country’s his-
tory, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted 
brother against brother, neighbor against 
neighbor and threatened to tear the fabric of 
our union apart forever that America truly be-
came the land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once 
said, ‘‘Freedom is never free,’’ and African 
American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph 
often said ‘‘Freedom is never given. It is won.’’ 
Truer words were never spoken. 
We should all recognize the power and the 
ironic truth of those statements, and we 
should pause to remember the enormous 
price paid by all Americans in our country’s 
quest to realize its promise. 
Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years 
of suffering African Americans endured under 
slavery and celebrates the legacy of persever-
ance that has become the hallmark of the Afri-
can American experience in the struggle for 
equality. 
In recent years, a number of National 
Juneteenth Organizations have arisen to take 
their place alongside older organizations—all 
with the mission to promote and cultivate 
knowledge and appreciation of African Amer-
ican history and culture. 
Juneteenth celebrates African American 
freedom while encouraging self-development 
and respect for all cultures. 
But it must always remain a reminder to us 
all that liberty and freedom are precious birth-
rights of all Americans, which must be jeal-
ously guarded and preserved for future gen-
erations. 
I urge all members to support the rule and 
the underlying legislation. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. I would like to thank my good 
friend and colleague from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) for the kind words for 
my home State of Pennsylvania, and 
for recognizing the descendants of 
those who fought to end slavery, espe-
cially those in Pennsylvania. 
Additionally, I would like to com-
mend her on working on the House 
companion for, from what I am under-
standing, years and years. So this cer-
tainly says volumes about the work 
she put into the bill, and I would just 
like to thank her. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
President 
Lincoln 
issued the Emancipation Proclamation 
in 1863, but it took 21⁄2 years for slaves 
in Texas to learn of their freedom. S. 
475 will finally designate June 19 as a 
national holiday and highlight the im-
portant history and contribution of 
Black Americans and those who fought 
and died to end slavery. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. I want 
to echo the remarks of my distin-
guished 
colleague, 
Representative 
SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE, in mentioning 
Pennsylvania’s history in this moment. 
I want to highlight Philadelphia’s role 
in our Nation’s abolitionist movement, 
the Quakers, Lucretia Mott, who em-
braced that movement and pushed this 
country forward, the role of our resi-
dents in fighting and winning the Civil 
War, and being the birthplace of Amer-
ican ideals at Independence Hall. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that in passing 
this rule and the underlying bill we 
will take a collective step forward in 
achieving those goals that all Ameri-
cans are equal under the law, treated 
fairly in our schools, our workplaces, 
our courts, and our public institutions. 
Symbols hold power. Holidays hold 
power. While millions of Americans al-
ready celebrate Juneteenth and use the 
day to reflect on our collective past 
and future, this is an important step to 
formally commemorate a crucial part 
of our culture and history. I urge, 
again, that all my colleagues vote for 
the rule and the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time, and I move the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The previous question was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the adoption of the reso-
lution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 214, nays 
208, not voting 8, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

June 16, 2021 
S. 475 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Juneteenth 
National Independence Day Act’’. 
SEC. 2. JUNETEENTH NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE 
DAY AS A LEGAL PUBLIC HOLIDAY. 
Section 6103(a) of title 5, United States 
Code, is amended by inserting after the item 
relating to Memorial Day the following: 
‘‘Juneteenth National Independence Day, 
June 19.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform or 
their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) and the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Member have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and insert extra-
neous material on S. 475. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Today, I rise in strong support of S. 
475, the Juneteenth National Independ-
ence Day Act. 
I thank my good friend and col-
league, SHEILA JACKSON LEE, for intro-
ducing the House companion bill, H.R. 
1320, which has over 170 cosponsors. 
This bill would establish Juneteenth, 
which is celebrated on June 19th, as a 
Federal holiday. 
Our Federal holidays are purpose-
fully few in number and recognize the 
most important milestones in our 
country’s history. I cannot think of a 
more important milestone to com-
memorate than the end of slavery in 
the United States. 
At the end of the Civil War in 1865, 
hundreds of thousands of people re-
mained enslaved, despite the Emanci-
pation Proclamation being issued near-
ly 2 years earlier. 
On June 19, 1865, Major General Gor-
don Granger traveled to Galveston, 
Texas, and issued General Order Num-
ber 3, which declared that all slaves are 
free. That is when 250,000 enslaved indi-
viduals in Texas finally learned that 
they were free. The celebration that 
they held in Galveston on that day is 
the basis for the Juneteenth celebra-
tions today. 
Juneteenth is considered the longest- 
running 
African-American 
holiday 
marking the end of slavery in the 
United States, and it has been cele-
brated across the Nation for over 150 
years. 
First 
known 
as 
Jubilee 
Day, 
Juneteenth is marked by food, music, 
and 
fellowship. 
These 
celebrations 
honor freedom, recognize life, and up-
lift the complex history and the beau-
tiful culture of the African-American 
community. 
Forty-seven States and the District 
of Columbia have made Juneteenth a 
public holiday, including my own State 
of New York. 
While millions of Americans have 
celebrated this important day for gen-
erations, the Federal Government has 
failed in its responsibility to recognize 
its significance. Today, we can change 
that. 
It is often said that those who do not 
remember their past are doomed to re-
peat it. If we want to confront the sins 
of slavery and move forward towards a 
more equitable, fair, and free society, 
it is incumbent upon us to recognize 
not only our past evils, but the mo-
ments of triumph over those evils. 
Making Juneteenth a Federal holiday 
is a crucial step in remembering our 
past, and it will undoubtedly help us 
build a better future. 
I thank Senator ED MARKEY for his 
longtime leadership on this bill. As a 
result of his hard work, yesterday, the 
Senate unanimously passed S. 475 to 
make Juneteenth an official Federal 
holiday. Democrats and Republicans 
passed it unanimously. 
Senator CORNYN, a conservative Re-
publican from Texas, stated: ‘‘The free-
dom of all Americans that Texas cele-
brates every Juneteenth should be cele-
brated all across the Nation. The pas-
sage of this bill represents a big step in 
our Nation’s journey toward equality.’’ 
In this time of increasing partisan-
ship, Senator CORNYN’s strong support 
speaks to the importance and urgency 
of this bill. 
I also thank again my good friend, 
Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
who 
has 
been 
advocating 
for 
Juneteenth to be a Federal holiday for 
over 12 years. This bill would not be 
possible without her steadfast support 
and hard work. 
It is now our responsibility to swiftly 
pass this bill and finally enshrine this 
important celebration in national law. 
As we strive toward a more perfect 
Union, it is critical that we acknowl-
edge 
the 
national 
significance 
of 
Juneteenth. This day not only honors 
the past and celebrates the present, but 
it offers an opportunity to reflect upon 
ways to create an even more just soci-
ety. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this vitally im-
portant bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, Juneteenth is an 
important day, and remembering and 
celebrating the emancipation of Afri-
can Americans in the United States is 
certainly worthy of commemoration. 
All Americans should celebrate our 
fight for freedom. 
It is a fitting tribute first celebrated 
in the State of Texas to commemorate 
the day in 1865, when President Abra-
ham Lincoln’s Emancipation Procla-
mation was recognized in that State. 
I do plan to vote in favor of this bill 
that passed unanimously in the Senate 
yesterday. However, I would be remiss 
if I did not discuss the procedure lead-
ing up to consideration of this legisla-
tion. 
Just a few mere hours ago, the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform, which 
has jurisdiction over Federal holidays 
in the Federal workforce, learned that 
this legislation would be taken up 
today. Our committee’s job is to ensure 
the efficient and effective operation of 
the executive branch agencies. 
Unfortunately, 
we 
have 
not 
had 
ample time to consider the effects of 
granting the entire Federal workforce 
another day off work. And we do not 
know what effect, if any, this bill will 
have on Federal programs and missions 
that our government delivers to the 
American taxpayer each day. 
For instance, due to the rushed proc-
ess, we do not yet have an estimate 
from the Congressional Budget Office 
of how much this bill will cost. I know 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle have never really been concerned 
about the cost of a government pro-
gram, but the people on this side of the 
aisle and the American taxpayers have 
a concern about the cost of legislation 
that we pass on the floor of the House 
of Representatives. 
According to a 2014 analysis by Presi-
dent Obama’s Office of Management 
and Budget, it cost Federal taxpayers 
$660 million in payroll and holiday pre-
mium costs when Federal employees 
were given an extra holiday on the day 
after Christmas that year by executive 
order. 
Because we are not following regular 
order, which would have included a leg-
islative hearing and committee mark-
up, we do not fully understand the im-
pacts of this new Federal holiday and 
the true costs of lost productivity. 
Nevertheless, I thank my colleagues 
for the time to speak on this historical 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished Speak-
er of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I com-
mend our distinguished chair of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, 
and the Congress, for bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor within 
24 hours of it passing the Senate. 
It is a pretty exciting historic day. 
I thank Congresswoman JACKSON LEE 
for her sponsorship of this legislation 
for such a long time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to join my 
colleagues in the spirit of joy and pride 
as the Congress passes this legislation 
to declare Juneteenth a national holi-
day. 
With this step, Congress is ensuring 
that one of the most momentous

June 16, 2021 
events in our history—which has been 
celebrated by millions, particularly 
Black Americans for 150 years now—is 
officially recognized; that it is en-
shrined in our history books, and it 
takes its place of honor in our Nation. 
b 1800 
Juneteenth is a beautiful and proud 
celebration of freedom for Black Amer-
icans. It marks the day, 2 years after 
President Lincoln issued the Emanci-
pation Proclamation, when Major Gen-
eral Gordon Granger and Union sol-
diers delivered the news of liberation 
in Galveston, Texas, not far from the 
district the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE) represents. 
That day, General Granger conveyed 
the declaration that all are free with 
‘‘an absolute equality of rights and 
rights of property.’’ 
I know that Texas’ special place in 
our Nation’s history is cherished by its 
delegation, especially, as I mentioned, 
the Chair, Representative SHEILA JACK-
SON LEE, representing Houston. Thank 
you for being the author of the legisla-
tion, the House companion of S. 475. 
Thank you to the Congressional 
Black Caucus and its distinguished 
chair, Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY 
from Ohio, and the Texas delegation 
and all Members who have worked for 
this official recognition over many 
years, including Representative DANNY 
DAVIS. Thank you, also, to Committee 
on Oversight and Reform chair, CARO-
LYN MALONEY. 
We salute Senators ED MARKEY and 
JOHN CORNYN, leading in the Senate, 
and congratulate them on yesterday’s 
passage of S. 475 without objection. 
And let me salute the activists and 
leaders who carried this fight to this 
day, including the late Dr. Ronald 
Myers. For decades, until his passing, 
Doc Myers led the campaign to make 
Juneteenth a national day of observ-
ance. 
Over the past century and a half, 
Juneteenth has evolved into a day not 
only of celebration but of reflection. 
This day reminds us of a history much 
stained by brutality and injustice, and 
it reminds us of our responsibility to 
build a future of progress for all, hon-
oring the ideal of equality that is 
America’s 
heritage 
and 
America’s 
hope. 
I feel very honored to be here with 
the Congressional Black Caucus, as I 
mentioned already, to speak on behalf 
of this legislation. I thank them for 
making this day possible. I also had 
the honor of traveling with them to 
Ghana almost 2 years ago at the end of 
July as we observed the 400th anniver-
sary of the first slaves coming to 
America. 
John Lewis was with us on that trip 
to go to the Door of No Return, which 
is now the Door of Return, as it urges 
people to come back. Almost 402 years 
ago, the first slaves were pushed from 
Africa into dungeons, which were dead-
ly, and onto slave ships, which were 
death ships, to come across the ocean 
to a place where they would be 
enslaved for hundreds of years. 
It challenges the conscience of the 
world, and certainly of America, to 
even think about what happened to 
people in our country over that period 
of time. But to be there with the Con-
gressional Black Caucus was a very, 
very special honor, and to see the con-
nection between that Door of No Re-
turn and Ghana and the connection to 
our Members of Congress on the floor 
of this House today serving with such 
dignity and pride. 
Madam Speaker, we know that the 
fight against racism and toward equal-
ity has far to go, but it is a fight that 
continues with a renewed sense of ur-
gency all the time, now sparked by the 
murder of George Floyd and so many 
others. 
We salute Congresswoman KAREN 
BASS as she continues negotiations on 
the George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act, which now must become law. 
As we fight for its passage, the 
Democratic House remains committed 
to real, effective action to advance jus-
tice, fairness, and opportunity for all. 
That is the purpose of our Congres-
sional Black Caucus in this Congress. 
The Congressional Black Caucus is the 
conscience of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a bipartisan 
vote on this important legislation and 
thank all Members who have led this 
effort which strengthens America. 
I hope we can have, again, a strong 
bipartisan vote. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
me time. 
Madam Speaker, today, the House 
moves to establish June 19 as the 
Juneteenth 
National 
Independence 
Day, a national holiday commemo-
rating the end of slavery in the United 
States. 
June 19 marks the day Union troops 
arrived in my district in Galveston, 
Texas—I wasn’t alive back then, let me 
get that out there—in the heart of 
what is now the 14th Congressional 
District of Texas, the Gulf Coast of 
Texas. Those troops arrived to an-
nounce and enforce the Emancipation 
Proclamation. 
On that day, General Gordon Granger 
delivered the news of President Abra-
ham Lincoln’s proclamation, which had 
abolished slavery more than 2 years be-
fore, on January 1, 1863. That was his 
intent. It was the law, and it should 
have been done. But we had a ways to 
go, didn’t we, to abolish slavery? We 
really did. 
The abolition of slavery was a key 
milestone toward fulfilling our Found-
ers’ promise, underwritten by the self- 
evident truths of natural law, that all 
humans are created equal and should 
enjoy the same protections under the 
law. 
Ingrained in Texas culture, my great 
Texas, this special day has already 
been recognized, which the chairwoman 
eloquently spoke about, in 47 of the 50 
States here in the United States, and it 
is long overdue to be recognized as a 
Federal holiday. I have been working 
on it myself for several years with my 
friends, SHEILA JACKSON LEE and JOHN 
CORNYN, and others. 
This year’s celebration should be 
rooted in the works of repair we have 
done, still need to do, and will continue 
to do, Lord willing, as a country that 
has endured periods of racial tension, 
which have tried to divide our people. 
Let it not be so. 
As President Abraham Lincoln nota-
bly quoted from the Bible, he said: ‘‘A 
house divided against itself cannot 
stand.’’ Our country can and should— 
and, Lord, I will say ‘‘will’’—unite be-
yond the divisions that we have faced. 
And this is a long way toward that. 
The forces that try to divide our Na-
tion will not prevail as we stand firm 
in our identity as Americans. We are a 
people refined through the trials of fire 
and made stronger and stronger than 
ever. 
Juneteenth reminds us of the free-
dom so bravely defended by many, 
many Americans, and it encourages us 
to remain steadfast in the good fight 
against division. It also reminds us we 
have a ways to go. 
‘‘A house divided cannot stand.’’ 
That is absolutely true. But a house 
that is united is unshakeable. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a step toward 
that unification. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE), the author of the com-
panion to the Senate bill. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from New 
York for her courtesies. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been a long jour-
ney. It has not been yesterday, the day 
before, or last month, or a few years 
before. One could argue that it has 
been 12 years on this floor of the 
House. 
So many people have been involved: 
DANNY
DAVIS; my colleagues in the 
United States Senate, Senator CORNYN 
and Senator MARKEY; Barbara-Rose 
Collins, some 25 years ago with a reso-
lution; others unnamed; and organiza-
tions across the Nation and some inter-
national. 
It has been a long journey. It has not 
been an easy journey. When we stand 
here today, we should be reminded of 
the fact that there were people who 
continued to experience the whips of a 
whip for 2 more years, even as Abra-
ham Lincoln stood in the shining sun 
in the aftermath of Gettysburg to 
unite the Union and proclaim the 
slaves free in 1863. 
Just a few years ago, I had the teary 
privilege of being, at midnight, in the 
National Archives, looking at that doc-
ument. Then, of course, it took 2 years 
for General Granger to get to Texas. 
But in that 2 years, we realize that 
tragedy continued and brutality con-
tinued, even into the 20th century.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2866 
June 16, 2021 
I salute the miraculous coming to-
gether today of the House leadership, 
the Speaker, Leader HOYER, Whip CLY-
BURN, Chairman JEFFRIES, and others 
who brought this to the floor through a 
rule, Chairman MCGOVERN, and then a 
debate. Then, of course, here we are 
today. It is a long journey, but here we 
are. 
I am grateful, as I said earlier, that 
racial divide has fallen out of the sky, 
and we are crushing it to the Earth for 
this day, for the Juneteenth holiday. 
H.R. 1320 was a bipartisan bill with 
over 166 sponsors, as well as now S. 475. 
We are delighted to note that the 
President will sign this bill. 
When the words of General Granger 
were said—the people of Texas and 
other places are informed that in ac-
cordance with the proclamation from 
the executive, all slaves are free—then, 
in the same year, the 13th Amendment 
was passed. 
This bill and this day are about free-
dom. At Gettysburg, that is what 
President Lincoln said in 1863, that 
this Nation under God shall have a new 
birth of freedom. 
Why can’t we continue on this path-
way as we push the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act, as we come to-
gether on the Voting Rights Act, as we 
realize that there is another path for 
America to take, that my freedom is 
your freedom and your freedom is my 
freedom? 
Yes, slaves suffered continuously. 
Even in the 20th century, they were 
hung. Yet, we have a time today, mi-
raculously, to be able to debate and 
vote on the floor of the House. Diverse 
persons can stand and join this. 
So, I offer to my colleagues: Be re-
minded that this has been a long jour-
ney. There have been mountains and 
valleys, but we stand here today, free 
to vote for the Juneteenth National 
Independence Day, a Federal holiday 
for America. Freedom is now. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
House Judiciary Committee, the Chair of the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Crime, 
Terrorism, 
and 
Homeland Security, and the principal sponsor 
in the House of the Juneteenth National Inde-
pendence Day Act, I rise in strong and enthu-
siastic support of S. 475, the Senate com-
panion to the Juneteenth National Independ-
ence Day Act I introduced on February 25, 
2021, which establishes June 19 as a federal 
holiday. 
I applaud the U.S. Senate for passing S. 
475, Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act, companion legislation to H.R. 1320, which 
I introduced to make Juneteenth a federal holi-
day to commemorate the end of chattel slav-
ery, America’s Original Sin, and to celebrate 
the perseverance that has been the hallmark 
of the African American struggle for equality. 
I thank Senator MARKEY of Massachusetts 
for contacting my office with his request to in-
troduce the Senate companion to H.R. 1320 
for this Congress, and to my senior senator, 
Senator JOHN CORNYN of Texas for his stead-
fast support of the Juneteenth holiday over the 
years, and others who spearheaded this effort 
in the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader 
SCHUMER for his support and for using his leg-
islative skills to ensure the bill was voted on 
and passed. 
Mr. Speaker, the process that has brought 
us to this day has been bipartisan, bicameral, 
cooperative, and constructive beginning with 
my collaboration in the 116th Congress with 
former Senator Doug Jones of Alabama and 
Senator CORNYN of Texas to coordinate the in-
troduction and cultivate the necessary support 
for the Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act. 
That partnership has continued through the 
117th Congress with the addition of Senator 
MARKEY of Massachusetts as the lead Demo-
cratic sponsor in the Senate. 
The bipartisan H.R. 1320, the House 
version of S. 475, is sponsored by 166 Mem-
bers from all regions of the country, including 
two of my Republican colleagues from Texas, 
Congressman VAN TAYLOR and Congressman 
RANDY WEBER. 
Mr. Speaker, now it is time for the House of 
Representatives to act swiftly and bring to the 
floor, vote on, pass the Juneteenth National 
Independence Day Act, and send it to the 
desk of President Biden for signature. 
With the President’s signature, the federal 
government will join 47 states in recognizing 
as a holiday Juneteenth, the day that has 
been celebrated by African Americans for 156 
years and has been called rightly as ’Amer-
ica’s second Independence Day.’ 
Let me extend on behalf of all of us who 
have labored to pass this important legislation 
our deep appreciation to the House leader-
ship, particularly Majority Leader HOYER, for 
their support which paved the way for the 
House last year to pass by unanimous con-
sent H. Res. 1001, the resolution I introduced 
recognizing Juneteenth Independence Day. 
As I have said many times, Juneteenth is as 
significant to African Americans as July 4 is to 
all Americans because on that day, June 19, 
155 years ago, General Gordon Granger, the 
Commanding Officer of the District of Texas, 
rode into Galveston, Texas, and announced 
the freedom of the last American slaves; belat-
edly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly 
two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln 
signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
When General Granger read these words of 
General Order No. 3 it set off joyous celebra-
tions of the freedmen and women of Texas: 
The people of Texas are informed that in 
accordance with a Proclamation from the 
Executive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
rights and rights of property between former 
masters and slaves, and the connection 
therefore existing between them becomes 
that between employer and hired laborer. 
Juneteenth thus made real to the last per-
sons living under the system of chattel slav-
ery, of human bondage, the prophetic words 
of President Abraham Lincoln delivered No-
vember 19, 1863, at Gettysburg ‘that this na-
tion, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom—and that government of the people, 
by the people, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earth.’ 
Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas 
state capital in 1867 under the direction of the 
Freedmen’s Bureau and remains the oldest 
known celebration of slavery’s demise, com-
memorating freedom while acknowledging the 
sacrifices and contributions made by coura-
geous African Americans towards making our 
great Nation the more conscious and accept-
ing country that it has become. 
As the Nation prepares to celebrate July 
4th, our Nation’s independence day, it is a 
time to reflect on the accomplishments of our 
Nation and its people. 
The celebration of Juneteenth followed the 
most devastating conflict in our country’s his-
tory, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted 
brother against brother, neighbor against 
neighbor and threatened to tear the fabric of 
our union apart forever that America truly be-
came the land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years 
of suffering African Americans endured under 
slavery and celebrates the perseverance that 
has been the hallmark of the African American 
experience in the struggle for equality. 
But as the poet Langston Hughes reminds 
us in his famous poem, ‘‘Mother to Son,’’ life 
in America for African Americans ‘‘ain’t been 
no crystal stair.’’ 
The post-bellum period in America was 
marked by violence and terrorism against Afri-
can Americans as they sought to make real 
the promises of the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the Constitution. 
General Granger’s reading of General Order 
No. 3 ended the remaining vestiges of the 
system of chattel slavery, a form of perpetual 
human bondage that held generations of Afri-
cans in captivity in the United States for 248 
years and opened a new chapter in American 
history. 
Recognizing the importance of this date, 
former slaves coined the word ‘‘Juneteenth’’ to 
celebrate the occasion, the first of which oc-
curred in the Texas state capital in 1867 under 
the direction of the Freedmen’s Bureau. 
Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of 
freedom for people who did not have it. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of America’s freedom from slavery. 
It commemorates freedom while acknowl-
edging the sacrifices and contributions made 
by courageous African Americans in the quest 
to make our lives more perfect. 
The celebration of Juneteenth followed the 
most devastating conflict in our country’s his-
tory, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted 
brother against brother, neighbor against 
neighbor and threatened to tear the fabric of 
our union apart forever that America truly be-
came the land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once 
said, ‘‘Freedom is never free,’’ and African 
American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph 
often said ‘‘Freedom is never given. It is won.’’ 
Truer words were never spoken. 
We should all recognize the power and the 
ironic truth of those statements, and we 
should pause to remember the enormous 
price paid by all Americans in our country’s 
quest to realize its promise. 
In recent years, a number of National 
Juneteenth Organizations have arisen to take 
their place alongside older organizations—all 
with the mission to promote and cultivate 
knowledge and appreciation of African Amer-
ican history and culture. 
I am reminded that the first legislation intro-
duced in Congress recognizing Juneteenth oc-
curred a quarter century ago, in 1996, when 
H.J. Res. 195 was introduced by Congress-
woman Barbara Rose Collins of Michigan, and 
I have introduced similar legislation annually 
since the 109th Congress. 
So it has been a long road we have trav-
elled to get to this day, even longer that the

H2867 
June 16, 2021 
15-year journey taken to pass the bill making 
the Birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. a national holiday. 
Juneteenth celebrates African American 
freedom, and in so doing celebrates America’s 
history and promise, while encouraging self- 
development and respect for all cultures. 
But it must always remain a reminder to us 
all that liberty and freedom are precious birth-
rights of all Americans, which must be jeal-
ously guarded and preserved for future gen-
erations. 
In conclusion, I wish to take a moment to 
salute two of the unsung heroes who helped 
bring us to this day: the late Texas State Rep-
resentative Al Edwards and nonagenarian 
Opal Lee, known affectionately as the ‘‘Grand-
mother of Juneteenth.’’ 
In 
1852, 
Frederick 
Douglass 
famously 
asked: ‘‘What to the slave is the 4th of July?’’ 
In 2021, we can reply that it is the beginning 
of the American Promise that would be fulfilled 
and made real for all Americans, including the 
descendants of slaves, on June 19, 1865, 
‘Juneteenth Day.’ 
That is why we celebrate Juneteenth and 
that is why I urge all Members to join me in 
voting to pass S. 475, the ‘‘Juneteenth Na-
tional Independence Day Act.’’ 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
holiday and in objection to the means 
by which the Democrats have brought 
this to the floor. 
It is just wrong that this holiday, 
which should be recognized—arguments 
against it are vacuous. A CBO score is 
not real because it doesn’t recognize 
the productivity of Americans during a 
holiday week in anticipation of a holi-
day and increased productivity after 
the holiday, and it doesn’t recognize 
the positive impact of the economy by 
those who celebrate the holiday, and 
the money they spend. 
So, the CBO score is not an argu-
ment. We support the holiday. But why 
would the Democrats want to politicize 
this by co-opting the name of our sa-
cred holiday of Independence Day. Why 
would it not be named the Juneteenth 
National 
Emancipation 
Day? 
Why 
would we want to inject conflict about 
this? 
I don’t understand this body and the 
way it moves forward contrary to the 
best interests of the American people. 
We all support the holiday. I am voting 
in support of the bill, but the objec-
tion—and my Democrat friends know 
this—the objection would be to the 
naming of the bill. 
Where would that have been con-
fronted? In committee. But this bill 
was not brought to committee, was it? 
It was brought directly to the floor for 
a vote, a trap set by my Democratic 
colleagues for conservatives on this 
side of the aisle who they knew would 
object to the naming of this bill and 
the co-opting of our Independence Day. 
They did not bring it through com-
mittee where we could have this con-
versation legitimately and for the his-
torical record. 
Everyone on the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, we have jurisdiction 
over national holidays. We would have 
wanted to speak on this. We would 
have wanted to offer amendments. Did 
that happen? No. Were our amend-
ments accepted? No, because this was 
brought directly to the floor. 
That is what is wrong with this body. 
That is what is wrong about this bi-
zarre realm of Washington, D.C. 
Despite that, we are going to support 
the bill. I am going to support the bill 
because I support the holiday, and I 
support the Black communities. My 
Black brothers and sisters, Americans 
all, have been celebrating this holiday 
for 100 years. What is wrong with that? 
It is recognized by most States in the 
Union. This legislation just brings the 
Federal Government more in align-
ment with the sovereign States, which 
as a constitutionalist, I certainly sup-
port. 
Mr. Speaker, I object for the histor-
ical record since there was no com-
mittee activity. I object on the floor 
this day to the process that Democrats 
used to bring this bill to the floor and 
the name by which it is entitled. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
MFUME), a member of the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Juneteenth National Independ-
ence Day Act and to recognize and 
honor a day that symbolizes freedom 
for all African-ancestored Americans. 
My thanks to my colleague, Rep-
resentative SHEILA JACKSON LEE, for 
taking the lead on this important leg-
islation and for doing the hard work to 
put the imprimatur of the United 
States Congress on this day, a day that 
means so much to so many. 
b 1815 
As an original cosponsor of the legis-
lation, I am proud to say that, once 
again, we are at the doorstep of his-
tory, and to finally acknowledge that 
history in a new light. 
Juneteenth is a reminder that we 
must continue to move forward in 
honor and in recognition of ourselves, 
our families, our neighbors, and the 
nameless and faceless generations of 
African Americans that we will never 
know. Their plight and this history are 
all captured in the words of the poet 
Langston Hughes when he wrote: 
I, too, sing America. 
I am the darker brother. They send me to 
eat in the kitchen when company comes, but 
I laugh, and eat well, and I grow strong. 
Tomorrow, I’ll be at the table when com-
pany comes. Nobody’ll dare say to me, ‘‘eat 
in the kitchen’’ then. 
Besides, they’ll see how beautiful I am and 
be ashamed. 
I, too, am America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this Juneteenth National Independence 
Act, and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I applaud 
the work by Congresswoman JACKSON 
LEE, my colleague from Texas, on her 
work on this important recognition. 
And the gentlewoman knows that we 
discussed on the floor some of the con-
cerns that I have that I share with my 
colleague from Louisiana. 
I wish—because I do believe that 
there will be some division that comes 
out of embracing this so quickly, rath-
er than running it through committee, 
by embracing a name that is going to 
be seen as conflicting, whether cor-
related with, or something with our 
July 4th national independence rec-
ognition. 
And I understand it has been referred 
to as Independence Day over the years, 
and I understand why. I think for pur-
poses of recognition by the United 
States Government, it would be my 
preference, and I would offer an amend-
ment—if such things were ever done on 
the floor of this body. It is not, which 
is a sad state of affairs for the people’s 
House. We literally never amend any-
thing on the floor of this body. 
I would offer an amendment embrac-
ing the recognition of this important 
day, June 19, 1865, and what that meant 
for the actual end to slavery, and obvi-
ously, we then passed the 13th Amend-
ment, I believe, later that year in De-
cember. That is from memory, if that 
is right. 
And I think it would be important, 
and I believe it has often been referred 
to in our history as Jubilee Day, as 
Emancipation Day, as Freedom Day, I 
would be amenable to any of those 
names. I don’t believe that the title 
National Independence Day, I think, 
works. I would prefer that we just have 
a debate on that, and I wish we would 
have done that in committee. 
I agree with the gentleman from Lou-
isiana that it would have been pre-
ferred that we have that ability to do 
that, and that we should remember 
why regular order matters. As I told 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) earlier, I would prefer 
that we have this be unanimous, and I 
am afraid that it is not going to be 
unanimous. It will pass and it will pass 
overwhelmingly. It is good that we will 
pass it and that this day will be com-
memorated, as it should, as we have 
been commemorating it in Texas for a 
long time. 
But it would be my strong pref-
erence, and I just wish this body—I 
wish we could get back to a time where 
we could sit down and work together 
when we have these minor differences, 
because I believe if we did, we really 
would probably pass this unanimously. 
There may be one or two that would 
vote ‘‘no’’ because of the 660 million, or 
whatever, people would say. 
But we recognize the importance of 
the day, and I would just implore my

colleagues going forward that on all of 
these issues, particularly where there 
is so much agreement, that we would 
find a way to come together to be able 
to hash out some of these differences so 
there could be a more unanimous belief 
and buy-in to what we are doing. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 min-
utes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the Demo-
cratic whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me 
this time. I do have some prepared re-
marks here, but don’t tell my staff 
that I’m not going to use them. 
I want to speak just a little bit about 
what I just heard and what I think 
some of our challenges are in this great 
country of ours. And it is a great coun-
try. It does not need to be made great 
again. Our problem is making this 
greatness accessible and affordable for 
all of its citizens. 
I think one of the ways that we do 
that is to recognize that we have a 
shared history in this country, but it is 
a history that is spotted with a lot of 
inequities, inequalities, and a lot of 
things that we ought to be about the 
business of working to try and level off 
the so-called playing field. One of 
those, I think, is really about the abil-
ity to communicate. 
When we talk about Juneteenth, I 
often equate the history of Juneteenth 
with our country’s inability to commu-
nicate, 
because 
the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation, signed by Abraham Lin-
coln in 1862, was to be effective Janu-
ary 1, 1863, freeing all the slaves in the 
Confederate States not under Union 
control. 
Now, when that happened, there was 
a big meeting down on the banks of a 
river in Beaufort County, South Caro-
lina, near Port Royal, and 4,000 slaves 
came to listen to General Saxton read 
the Emancipation Proclamation. On 
that day they were free. 
However, it was June 19, 1865, 21⁄2 
years later before it was communicated 
to those who were enslaved in Texas. 
The failure to communicate kept them 
in slavery for another 21⁄2 years. 
The failure to communicate is what 
seemed to keep us from coming to-
gether as one people today. 
If we learned the lessons of history, 
as George Santayana once said to us: 
When we learn the lessons of history, 
we are bound to repeat them if we 
don’t. 
So I would hope that as we turn this 
piece of legislation into law and create 
a national holiday for Juneteenth, I 
hope we will keep a couple things in 
mind. It is not lost on me that this 
building we all meet in was built by 
slaves. 
And one of the little known facts was 
a man named Philip Reid, who was 
enslaved in Charleston, South Caro-
lina, and who came, after being bought, 
to Washington, D.C., worked in the 
foundry. And when the foundry made 
the Statue of Freedom, they couldn’t 
get it up on top of the building. 
All of those learned people who had 
been free all of their lives could not 
figure out how to get that statue on 
top of this building. 
Philip Reid, enslaved, figured it out, 
and he showed them how to get that 
statue on top of this building. He was 
able to communicate some lessons that 
he could teach, though he was un-
learned. In fact, it was against the law 
to be able to teach him to read. His 
name was Reid, spelled a little dif-
ferently. 
Now, I would hope that we would pass 
this law. I suspect we won’t do what 
the Senate did and do it unanimously, 
though I think it would be a tremen-
dous demonstration of unity for every 
one of us who vote to pass this law rec-
ognizing June 19 as a national holiday. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, the 
bill before us rightly commemorates 
June 19, 1865, the day Major General 
Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, 
Texas, announcing the end of the Civil 
War, and the formal end of slavery. It 
is effectively freedom day for the last 
enslaved Americans. 
Of course, that was only in law. In 
practice, America failed to secure the 
blessings of liberty for those formerly 
enslaved 
Americans. 
Instead, 
when 
Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, the 
assassin effectively muted reconstruc-
tion. 
Leaders, like Pennsylvania Congress-
man Thaddeus Stevens, rightly called 
for a much more aggressive reconstruc-
tion, but he failed to persuade his col-
leagues. The long struggle in defense of 
freedom is part of America’s history. 
At our founding, in the Declaration 
of Independence, our Founders elo-
quently stated that all people are en-
dowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among them 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness. 
Winning the revolution offered the 
potential for leaders like John Adams 
to rightly persuade their colleagues to 
end slavery, but they failed. Their fail-
ure set the stage for the Civil War, and 
the failure to complete reconstruction 
meant 100 years of Jim Crow, and sepa-
rate but equal, that continued into my 
dad’s lifetime. 
America’s failure to rightly recognize 
our painful and often unjust history 
has 
meant 
ongoing 
division, 
open 
wounds that continue to fester. 
So, today, let us not fail to persuade 
our colleagues. Let us recognize this 
holiday. I mean, it should, however, be 
known as Freedom Day or simply 
Juneteenth, not National Independence 
Day, which recognizes the Declaration, 
not freedom, but the Declaration of 
Independence. I hope we can correct 
that in the future, but let’s not allow 
perfect to become the enemy of this 
good bill, and I urge its passage. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Ms. TLAIB), a member of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
our 
wonderful 
colleague, 
Congress-
woman JACKSON LEE, for this amazing, 
incredible effort, and for me to be here, 
and to actually witness this is an 
honor. 
The passage of the Juneteenth Na-
tional Independence Day Act is long 
overdue recognition for generations of 
pain and suffering of our Black com-
munities. 
This comes at an important time, 
Madam Speaker. Across the country, 
we are seeing efforts to eliminate the 
teaching of our country’s history, like 
the injustices of slavery, from being 
taught in our own schools. 
This national holiday will serve as a 
powerful reminder that we cannot run 
from our past. That we must educate 
future generations of all of our history 
no matter how many want to delete it 
or to whitewash it. 
It is important to note, Madam 
Speaker, that this is just a minor step, 
far from really truly addressing the ills 
of our country. We must go further. 
Colleagues, we must go further. We 
must pass the For the People Act, to 
H.R. 40, which is the Commission to 
Study and Develop Reparation Pro-
posals for African Americans Act. We 
must do more. We need to transform 
the lives of our Black neighbors in a 
bold and meaningful way, and it will 
truly save lives. It will truly address 
why we need to take a moment and ad-
dress this in a way that becomes a na-
tional holiday. 
We must, again, take action to actu-
ally deliver for our Black neighbors.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, I fully 
support creating a day to celebrate the 
abolition of slavery, a dark portion of 
our Nation’s history. However, naming 
this day National Independence Day 
will create confusion and push Ameri-
cans to pick one of those 2 days as 
their Independence Day based on their 
racial identity. 
Why can’t we name this Emanci-
pation Day and come together as 
Americans and celebrate that day to-
gether as Americans? 
Black 
and 
White—all 
colors, 
all 
races, and all ethnicities—can then 
come together on Independence Day, 
which celebrates the creation of our 
country, throwing off an oppressive 
government, and come together as 
Black, White, and all races to celebrate 
that day, too? 
Why ask Americans to pick one of 
the two Independence Days to cele-
brate? I think it is wrong to do that. 
I think this day is misnamed. I do 
support creating a holiday and recog-
nizing that wonderful day and that 
wonderful time when we got rid of slav-
ery in this country. But let’s celebrate 
both of those days: Independence Day

and the day that we celebrate emanci-
pation and ridding our country of slav-
ery. Let’s celebrate those 2 days to-
gether as one Nation under God indi-
visible. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the distinguished gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), 
who is a member of the Oversight and 
Reform Committee. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the recognition of Juneteenth 
as a national holiday to celebrate the 
ending of the most horrific period and 
the most horrific policy and practices 
this Nation has ever known: slavery. 
I heard one of my colleagues suggest 
a moment ago that perhaps the cost of 
Juneteenth is not known. I guarantee 
you, Madam Speaker, that whatever 
the cost, it will not come close to the 
cost of slavery. 
Juneteenth is the recognition that 
darkness can come to light and that 
there is a celebration as my forefathers 
and -mothers struggled to endure the 
horror they experienced. So, cele-
brating Juneteenth as a national holi-
day is simply an idea whose time has 
come. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to vote 
for the resolution. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), who is 
a member of the Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise here today in strong support of 
Juneteenth 
National 
Independence 
Day. 
I want to say to my White colleague 
on the other side: Getting your inde-
pendence from being enslaved in a 
country is different from a country 
getting independence to rule them-
selves. It is not a day that you can loop 
together. That is inappropriate. 
It is a day for reflection and com-
memorating the end of slavery. It is 
also a recognition that we have so 
much work to do to rid this country of 
systemic racism, discrimination, and 
hate. 
Let’s talk about the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act and H.R. 4, the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. We still 
have much work to do. 
Juneteenth, what we are doing today, 
should empower us to fight even harder 
every single day for criminal justice 
reform, for racial equality, and for eco-
nomic empowerment of Black people in 
America. 
We are still today living through the 
blatant racism and slavery that denied 
us education, denied us opportunity for 
economic development and empower-
ment for ourselves, and denied us the 
right to have a job and own property. It 
is still today an issue in America. 
We have a responsibility to teach 
every generation of Black and White 
Americans the pride of a people who 
have survived, endured, and succeeded 
in these United States of America de-
spite slavery. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legisla-
tion because Black history is American 
history. We cannot hold our heads and 
try to ignore the sins of this country, 
but we can come together and cele-
brate a time when we made the right 
decision. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. LEE), who is a cardinal on the Ap-
propriations Committee. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON for her per-
sistent and consistent leadership on so 
many issues, especially getting this 
bill to the floor today. 
As another daughter of Texas, I am 
deeply connected to the history of 
Juneteenth. My grandfather, William 
Calhoun Parish, who helped raise me, 
was born in Galveston, Texas, just 10 
years after General Granger announced 
that enslaved Africans were freed from 
the brutal and barbaric legal institu-
tion of slavery. My ancestors—my 
great-grandmother—were enslaved in 
and around Galveston, Texas. 
Like myself, so many in the African- 
American community have celebrated 
Juneteenth as our liberation day. To 
us, it represents the day that enslaved 
African Americans were recognized as 
free men, women, and children. 
Yet, the end of slavery did not stop 
with the brutal treatment of African 
Americans in the United States. The 
persistence of racial disparities in 
housing, income, education, the wealth 
gap, and other areas of injustices Afri-
can Americans really are experiencing 
today are a direct result of the racism 
embedded in our institutions from our 
founding. 
So, it is not purely symbolic to make 
Juneteenth a holiday. It is an impor-
tant step toward the country reck-
oning the truth of its legacy of slavery 
in the past as manifested today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield the gen-
tlewoman an additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. LEE of California. It is mani-
fested in the racial injustices which all 
of us must work together to end. So, 
yes, it is so important that we have the 
truth told of this legacy of slavery so 
that we can move forward and work to-
gether to end these racial injustices. 
I am reminded of Dr. Maya Angelou 
and what she once wrote. She said, ‘‘I 
am the dream and the hope of the 
slave. I rise,’’ in ‘‘Still I Rise.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank you 
today for bringing this forward, and I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY), who is the chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, we 
cannot change the future if we can’t 
acknowledge the past. Juneteenth is 
the oldest nationally celebrated and 
commemorated ending of slavery in 
the United States. Emancipation did 
not free all slaves, only those in the 
Confederate States. Independence is 
freedom for all people. 
I rise today in strong support of S. 
475, a top priority of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, to enshrine Juneteenth 
as a legal public holiday and a bill with 
tremendous historical implications for 
our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you, Con-
gresswoman SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE, a 
member of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, for your work. 
I thank Speaker NANCY PELOSI for 
speaking truth to power on this floor. 
Lastly, as the chair of the powerful 
Congressional Black Caucus, I stand 
here leading our 58 members saying to 
you: We are the conscience of the Con-
gress. 
And today, I ask all of my Members 
to join us. Let us unite and pass this 
bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD), who 
is a former civil rights attorney, judge, 
and chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, on January 1, 1863, 
President Abraham Lincoln issued the 
Emancipation Proclamation to eman-
cipate 4 million slaves residing in the 
11 Southern States that were combat-
ants against the Union. 
The proclamation was significant but 
not totally effective. It did not include 
slaves who resided in the States that 
were not in rebellion. Lincoln was of 
the opinion he could only use his au-
thority against the States who were re-
belling. 
In addition, there was doubt about 
the legal efficacy of the proclamation 
since Congress had not participated. 
There were legal questions of whether 
the proclamation would expire fol-
lowing Lincoln’s Presidency and, very 
importantly, whether States would not 
free slaves without Federal interven-
tion. 
Juneteenth is significant because it 
marks the day when Federal troops ar-
rived in Galveston to take control of 
the State and ensure that all enslaved 
people were free. These Federal troops 
arrived 21⁄2 years after the signing of 
the proclamation. 
By passing this legislation, Madam 
Speaker, every American can now bet-
ter understand the African Americans’

ship. Every American can now partici-
pate in recognizing the end to slavery 
in America. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, may I inquire 
how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 15 minutes 
remaining. The gentlewoman from New 
York has 6 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT), who is a 
member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
enthusiastically 
support 
the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act. 
I am glad that Congress is finally 
taking action to formally memorialize 
Juneteenth as a Federal holiday just a 
year after my home State of New York 
took this step. 
Juneteenth is a reminder of a sad 
chapter in our history but one that we 
overcame, and this holiday will be a re-
minder that our freedom is not guaran-
teed but rather something that we will 
always fight for. 
While this new holiday is an impor-
tant step, in the backdrop, there are 
numerous efforts underway to limit the 
teaching of uncomfortable parts of our 
history, and there is an insidious plan 
to restrict the most important of our 
rights, the right to vote. Let this new 
holiday be not just a reminder but also 
a call to action that we must continue 
to work to secure our rights and free-
doms. 
b 1845 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
DAVID SCOTT), the chair of the Agri-
culture Committee. 
Mr. 
DAVID 
SCOTT 
of 
Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, let me say to some of 
my Republican friends: If our African- 
American slave ancestors were here 
today, they would say to you: 
You know, them that’s got should get, and 
them that’s not should lose, because the 
Bible says, and it still is news, your mama 
may have, and your papa may have, but God 
bless the child that’s got his own. 
God bless the child who can say I am 
free. Two hundred years in the deep 
slavery south, but God put hope in our 
hearts and a song in our mouths. All 
we are asking is for you to express the 
feeling and the depths of the African- 
American people today who need you, 
all of us, White and Black Members of 
Congress, to stand together and vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield an addi-
tional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ And by doing so, you will say 
not: This is my country. 
You will say in one united voice: This 
is our country, Black and White. This 
is our country, the greatest country, 
and we thank God Almighty for this 
blessing. 
Please, let us do as the Senate. Vote 
unanimously for passage of this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from New Jersey 
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN). 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, Juneteenth is a day for me of 
commemoration, not of celebration, 
because it reminds us of something 
that was delayed in happening. 
It also reminds me of what we don’t 
have today, and that is full access to 
justice, freedom, and equality. All of 
these are often in short supply as it re-
lates to the Black community, and it is 
still delayed. 
So, as we take this time to acknowl-
edge 
Juneteenth 
and 
to 
recognize 
Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act—something I definitely support—I 
pray that we do not lose track of the 
fact that we have so much more work 
to do to ensure that we have the fair-
ness, the equality, the opportunity, 
whether it is voting, working, or just 
living healthfully in the United States 
of America. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
VEASEY). 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, as a 
Texan, this is obviously a very impor-
tant day for me, and I am going to tell 
you what Juneteenth symbolizes for 
me. 
Juneteenth symbolizes 100 years of 
oppression that we faced after June 19, 
1865, after General Granger made his 
announcement in Galveston, Texas. 
It symbolizes Barbara Jordan coming 
to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the first Black woman 
from the south, 100 years after June 19, 
1865. 
It symbolizes three teenagers who 
died, handcuffed by law enforcement, 
in a boat in Mexia, Texas, at a 
Juneteenth gathering after they were 
arrested for celebrating this day with 
their family in 1981; over 100 years 
after June 19, 1865. 
It symbolizes Opal Lee, from Fort 
Worth, Texas, long known as the moth-
er of Juneteenth in Fort Worth, and 
now known nationally for her endeav-
ors to help make today possible. 
Someone 
mentioned 
the 
George 
Floyd Policing Bill earlier. And I want 
to tell you, Madam Speaker, things 
aren’t perfect. That police officer who 
handcuffed those teenagers and put 
them in that boat, he just retired a 
couple of years ago from law enforce-
ment. George Floyd fixes that. 
So while we celebrate what is about 
to become, with the Juneteenth holi-
day today, we know that we have a 
long way to go. But hallelujah, halle-
lujah, hallelujah, June 19, 1865, finally 
being enshrined in our national herit-
age. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. WATERS), the chair of the Finan-
cial Services Committee. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
rushed to the floor to be a part of abso-
lutely indicating my support for this 
important legislation, the Juneteenth 
National Independence Day. I am so 
pleased that we take this step today to 
honor the day and the month that the 
information of the signing of the 
Emancipation Proclamation reached 
enslaved people in Texas. It took more 
than 2 years before the news reached 
them. 
Juneteenth is a State holiday in the 
State of Texas. It was authored by my 
friend, Al Edwards, who is since de-
ceased. I wish he was alive today to 
witness this debate that is taking place 
on the floor of the Congress of the 
United States that will lead to the pas-
sage of the legislation that will make 
Juneteenth a national holiday. 
I was a little bit concerned when I 
heard some of the Members be opposed 
to the way that the bill is titled. They 
didn’t like the word ‘‘independence’’ 
that is in there because these are patri-
ots and they want to protect Independ-
ence Day and not have it mistaken in 
any way. 
But where were these patriots when 
the Capitol was being violated? 
Where were these patriots when the 
noose was hung, in plain view, for ev-
erybody to see, where slaves and people 
of color had lost their lives because 
they were hung, et cetera, et cetera? 
I want you to know that patriotism 
should be demonstrated all of the time. 
If you cannot demonstrate your patri-
otism when your Capitol is invaded, 
when the insurrection took place, then 
I question your patriotism.

tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I have no fur-
ther speakers and I reserve the balance 
of my time.

States already recognize the day as a 
holiday, or observe it, and establishing 
a Federal holiday mostly impacts the 
Federal workforce. I, therefore, support 
moving forward to designate this new 
Federal holiday. It is a day worthy of 
all Americans’ support. 
I want to congratulate those who 
have worked so hard to make this hap-
pen. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
In closing, I want to thank my good 
friend and colleague, SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE, who had the honor of presiding in 
the Speaker’s chair over this impor-
tant historic legislation on which she 
worked for over a decade. Her bill, H.R. 
1320, to establish Juneteenth Independ-
ence Day, has well over 166 cosponsors 
and bipartisan support. 
I, likewise, want to thank the Con-
gressional Black Caucus for their lead-
ership on this and for their leadership 
on so many other important issues to 
our Nation. 
Juneteenth is celebrated across our 
Nation. It marks the end of a very dark 
chapter in our Nation’s history and 
celebrates the promise of a more hope-
ful and inclusive tomorrow. I am elated 
that this bill is before the House. 
I urge passage of S. 475. I urge bipar-
tisan support, and I hope this vote is 
unanimous and victorious. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, Rev. Ronald V. ‘Doc’ Myers, Sr., 
M.D. (February 29, 1956—September 7, 
2018), was the first ordained and commis-
sioned medical missionary to America’s poor-
est region, the Mississippi Delta, by the Wis-
consin Baptist Pastors Conference and Pilgrim 
Rest Missionary Baptist Church, in Milwaukee, 
in 1990. 
Rev. Myers was the founder of numerous 
medical and cultural organizations and a com-
mitted physician serving the poorest Ameri-
cans through clinics in Tchula, Belzoni, Yazoo 
City, Indianola, Greenville and Tupelo, Mis-
sissippi. ‘Doc’ was also a jazz musician, com-
poser and human rights activist. The New 
York Times stated, ‘‘There aren’t many doc-
tors like Ronald Myers, a jazz-playing, Baptist- 
preaching, family practitioner whose dream 
has always been to practice medicine in the 
kind of place most other doctors wouldn’t even 
stop for a tank of gas.’’ 
In 1994 a group of community leaders from 
across the country gathered at Christian Unity 
Baptist Church in New Orleans, to work for 
greater national recognition of Juneteenth, a 
holiday celebrating the end of slavery. Myers 
was elected Chairman of this advocacy effort 
which lead to the establishment of the Na-
tional Juneteenth Observance Foundation and 
his recognition as the leader of the ‘‘Modern 
Juneteenth Movement’’ in America. Doc was 
instrumental in the passage of 45 of the 49 
state and District of Columbia’s pieces of leg-
islation naming Juneteenth as a Day of Ob-
servance in this country. 
Working with the Black Congressional Cau-
cus which included Illinois Senator Barack 
Obama and Representative DANNY DAVIS, he 
sought legislation to recognize Juneteenth 
Independence, hosting the annual Juneteenth 
Prayer Breakfasts. He established the Wash-
ington Juneteenth National Holiday Observ-
ance and the National Day of Reconciliation & 
Healing From the Legacy of Enslavement, 
which includes the National Juneteenth Black 
Holocaust ‘‘Maafa’’ Memorial Service. 
Dr. Myers organized the National Associa-
tion of Juneteenth Jazz Presenters, and the 
Fellowship of Creative Christian Jazz Musi-
cians. Under his leadership, the Washington 
Juneteenth Congressional Event was held by 
the National Juneteenth Observance Founda-
tion, Juneteenth America, Inc. & the National 
Association of Juneteenth Jazz Presenters. 
An accomplished jazz pianist, trumpeter and 
composer, Myers performed across the coun-
try promoting ‘‘June Is Black Music Month!’’— 
Celebrating Juneteenth Jazz—‘‘Preserving Our 
African American Jazz Legacy!’’ 
For over 20 years, Doc met with state politi-
cians, local Juneteenth organizations and 
community leaders 
Charles Taylor, author of Juneteenth said, 
‘‘Doc would give a copy of my Juneteenth 
book to every governor who made Juneteenth 
a holiday or observance. He even gave Sarah 
Palin a copy when she was the governor of 
Alaska after her state recognized Juneteenth.’’ 
At an award ceremony of the Beverly Hills 
Temple of the Arts at the Saban Theatre, 
founder Rabbi David Baron said, ‘‘Reverend 
Dr. Ronald V. Myers is an outstanding living 
model of all the values for which Martin Luther 
King stood.’’ 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today’s bill 
making Juneteenth, when the last slaves got 
word that slavery had ended, a federal holiday 
has unique meaning for the District of Colum-
bia because the slaves here were the first, not 
the last, to be freed. The reason, of course, is 
that the District was and is a federally con-
trolled jurisdiction. The District celebrates the 
emancipation of slaves here on April 16 every 
year. 
Juneteenth should remind Congress that it’s 
time for the first to be freed to finally become 
equal to other Americans. The House under-
stands that with its passage of the D.C. state-
hood bill. So does the Senate, with a hearing 
on our D.C. statehood bill scheduled for next 
Tuesday, June 22. 
With the President, the House, and the Sen-
ate all believing that the residents of their Na-
tion’s capital should in every way be equal to 
other Americans, we rejoice this Juneteenth 
knowing that we are close to adding the 51st 
star to the flag. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
on June 19, 1865, in Galveston, Texas, more 
than two years after President Lincoln issued 
the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation 
and 
six 
months after the passage of the Thirteenth 
Amendment outlawing slavery, Union Troops 
seized control of the area and declared all 
slaves free. 
Since then, ‘‘Juneteenth’’ has been ob-
served in Texas and in many places as Eman-
cipation Day and the end of slavery in the 
United 
States 
because 
many 
of 
those 
enslaved had not yet received the news of 
President Lincoln’s January 1, 1863, Emanci-
pation Proclamation. 
The news surrounding the Emancipation 
Proclamation and the end of slavery reached 
different regions at different times. While many 
commemorate this occasion on June 19, in 
areas such as Russell County, Alabama, the 
date marking the end of slavery is May 28, 
and as such, locals have established May 28 
as a community holiday to celebrate the day 
of freedom. 
For many of the enslaved, in communities 
across the south, this news was purposefully 
kept from them—denying them the freedom 
and rights they were due. It is a dark legacy 
we see repeating itself today which reminds 
us that freedom and rights—even that most 
fundamental right to vote—are precious and 
precarious. 
It has been a long and continuing march to-
wards equality and justice. So long as slavery 
existed and persisted, our country could never 
truly live up to its founding ideals of ‘‘life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’ The great 
strides made by courageous pioneers such as 
William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Parker, 
John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Low-
ell, William Wells Brown, and Frederick Doug-
lass were among the early steps to realize 
those ideals in America. 
Through Reconstruction, a Civil Rights 
Movement nearly 100 years later, and up 
through current efforts to eliminate the residual 
effects of slavery on the descendants of 
former slaves, the fight continues into this cen-
tury. Every step forward seems to have been 
met with opposition—too often violent opposi-
tion—against recognition that ‘‘all men are cre-
ated equal’’. The words of Frederick Douglass 
ring true today that ‘‘freedom is a constant 
struggle’’. 
As we remember the struggles and suc-
cesses of the past, we must use this occasion 
to renew our efforts to wipe out the vestiges 
of slavery that still remain. 
Juneteenth is not only a reminder of the end 
of an odious era in our Nation’s history, but a 
reminder of the work that still needs to be 
done before we can truly celebrate freedom. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
applaud the United States Senate for unani-
mously passing legislation to nationally recog-
nize Juneteenth as a federal holiday. 
Juneteenth marks the anniversary of Gen-
eral Gordon Granger arriving in Galveston, 
Texas, and delivering the news of emanci-
pation to enslaved Texans on June 19, 1865. 
More than two years after President Lin-
coln’s January 1, 1863 Emancipation Procla-
mation and more than two months after the 
end of the civil war, the enslaved in Texas fi-
nally received word of their freedom from Gen-
eral Granger, who was backed by 2,000 Union 
soldiers. 
These newly freed persons—the last to re-
ceive the news of their emancipation in the 
Confederate states—started a grassroots cele-
bration in Texas known as ‘Jubilee Day’ to 
commemorate the life-altering event. Jubilee 
celebrations spread throughout the South and 
eventually to the rest of the country and taking 
on the moniker ‘Juneteenth,’ a portmanteau 
meaning June 19th. 
Although official recognition of this day has 
been slow to come, work by individuals such 
as the late Al Edwards—former state rep-
resentative and the father of the Juneteenth 
holiday in Texas—has led to all but three 
states recognizing Juneteenth with annual 
celebratory events. 
Now, what began as a grassroots move-
ment to commemorate Texas history is set to 
become our nation’s next federal holiday.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDGE 
JACK B. WEINSTEIN 
(Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor a giant of the judiciary; a mem-
ber of the Greatest Generation; an 
independent advocate for the least, the 
lost, and the left behind. 
Yesterday, the Eastern District of 
New York, the residents of Great Neck, 
his family, and all justice-seeking peo-
ple lost a giant intellect and champion. 
Judge Jack B. Weinstein was 99 years 
old. 
Judge Weinstein served as a Navy 
lieutenant during World War II. After 
the war, Weinstein graduated from Co-
lumbia Law School on the GI Bill and 
went to work for the NAACP; clerk for 
the Court of Appeals; teach at Colum-
bia; serve as the Nassau County Attor-
ney; and, in 1967, President Johnson ap-
pointed him to the Federal bench. 
My father, also a World War II vet-
eran and member of the State judici-
ary, always pushed me to seek out and 
learn from this brilliant jurist when I 
clerked in the same courthouse. Judge 
Weinstein encouraged me throughout 
my career. 
Judge Weinstein created the concept 
of a special master in complex mass 
tort cases. He protested mandatory 
sentencing guidelines that he believed 
betrayed the concept that the punish-
ment should fit the crime, especially in 
drug cases. 
Time does not permit me to properly 
extol his intellect, compassion, and im-
pact, but on behalf of the people of the 
Third Congressional District of New 
York, I offer my condolences to his 
family and I hope they will take com-
fort that his life will never be forgot-
ten.

House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor Mary Lott Walker 
of Blackshear, Georgia, who passed 
away on May 12 at the age of 85. 
Mary loved her city of Blackshear, 
her State of Georgia, and her country, 
the United States of America, de-
voutly. 
After graduating from Georgia State 
College for Women, Mary began her in-
fluential career in public education. 
Mary was also involved in politics, 
becoming 
the 
first 
woman 
in 
Blackshear to serve as mayor pro tem-
pore. 
Through her work in Georgian edu-
cation, politics, and historical preser-
vation, Mary inspired young people to 
achieve greatness. 
Above all, she devoted more than 67 
years of membership and leadership to 
the Blackshear Presbyterian Church. 
Mary’s profound community impacts 
will be felt for generations to come. 
My thoughts and prayer are with her 
family, friends, and all who knew her 
during this most difficult time. 
f 
THE 
CARE 
ECONOMY 
IS 
THE 
HEART OF AMERICAN COMMU-
NITIES 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, even before COVID–19 hit, the 
care economy was at the heart of our 
communities. 
Care workers keep our kids safe, our 
families healthy, and our businesses 
open. 
Last week, I met with a group of 
childcare providers in San Diego, ex-
traordinary women who do this work 
because they have a passion for helping 
kids. They love their jobs and they love 
the kids they care for, but that doesn’t 
mean they should have to accept low 
wages and job insecurity. 
When the pandemic hit, thousands of 
childcare centers across the country 
closed, including more than 500 in San 
Diego County, leading to devastating 
job loss in an industry that is 95 per-
cent women. 
The American Rescue Plan included 
$39 billion in grants to help parents af-
ford childcare, and funding to help pro-
viders stay open and pay workers. 
Now we need to go further. 
The American Families Plan will cre-
ate universal pre-K, make childcare af-
fordable to all, and pay care workers a 
living wage. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s make sure that we 
care for the amazing workers who care 
for our future. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
FLAG 
DAY 
AND 
CELEBRATING 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES ARMY’S 246TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Flag Day and celebrate the United 
States Army’s 246th birthday that we 
observed on Monday of this week. 
Every year, just a few days after Me-
morial Day, on June 14, our country 
celebrates Flag Day and the Army’s 
birthday. 
Flag Day is a celebration of our Stars 
and Stripes, which the Second Conti-
nental Congress designated as the sym-
bol of our Nation on June 14, 1777. 
While our flag has changed over the 
years to celebrate our growing coun-
try, it remains a glorious symbol of 
hope for our brave servicemen and 
-women who salute it; defend it; serve 
it; and, in some cases, die for it, to pro-
tect our freedom and liberty. 
Since our founding, our flag has 
flown from sea to shining sea and 
around the world. Old Glory remains 
one of the most powerful symbols on 
Earth. 
June 14 is also the U.S. Army’s birth-
day. Without our Army 246 years ago, 
we would not be the great Nation that 
we are today. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, our great 
Nation celebrated our Army and our 
flag, both of which symbolize America 
being the land of the free and the home 
of the brave. 
f 
AMERICANS MUST GET 
VACCINATED 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, we are not 
normal. We are not over the pandemic. 
We are not over coronavirus and 
COVID–19. 
Many people in our country, over a 
majority in my State of Tennessee, 
have not been immunized, have not had 
the vaccine. 
I urge everyone to get vaccinated. 
When I was a young child, 5 years 
old, I got polio. Four months before I 
got polio, my father gave the polio vac-
cine to second graders in a test in Ten-
nessee. He gave it to my brother in the 
second grade. He took some vaccine 
home to give to me, but decided it was 
outside of his call and didn’t do it. I 
got polio. It has affected me every day 
of my life since, and it affected my fa-
ther as well. 
I urge everybody to get the vaccine, 
not to regret it. Keep your children, 
your family, and your neighbors safe 
and free from illness. 
f 
A MOMENT OF THANKS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it 
is not often when you can stand on the 
floor of the House and use the termi-
nology: I feel full or filled. 
It is a terminology that many of us 
are familiar with in the religious com-
munities of our Black American tradi-
tion. 
But after a journey of 10 years, I just 
want to take this moment to thank all 
of my colleagues, Democrats and Re-
publicans, who showed America that 
there is unity in the understanding of 
our history, that the history of slavery 
is the original sin and should never be 
ignored. 
But now we have a national inde-
pendence holiday for Juneteenth. Let 
us come together. 
I thank Senator MARKEY; Senator 
CORNYN; Senator SMITH; our friend 
DANNY
DAVIS; Doug Matthews; the 
Moody family; and, of course, Reverend 
Thomas and many others from the Gal-
veston area; Opal Lee; and the father of 
Juneteenth, the late Representative Al 
Edwards. 
Opal Lee still lives. She brought 1.6 
million petitions to the United States 
Congress in the dead of summer. 
On behalf of all who have waited for 
this, I thank them. And to the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, JOYCE BEATTY as 
the Chair, we stand here as the con-
science of the Congress thanking them 
with all my colleagues. 
Again, we say our message is our 
power. We are here to serve, and there 
is more to come in changing lives for 
justice, equality, and freedom. That is 
what happened today. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF SMALL LOCAL 
FARMERS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, accord-
ing to the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s Economic Research Service, 
small family farms account for 90 per-
cent of all U.S. farms. These farms are 
vital to local communities and econo-
mies, and they provide fresh produce 
for their local farmers’ markets, farm- 
to-school programs, soup kitchens, and 
a host of other local consumer activity. 
Sales attributed to these farmers can 
total up to $12 billion annually. 
I 
was 
thrilled 
to 
see 
President 
Biden’s administration, through the 
Department of Agriculture Secretary 
Tom Vilsack, recently announce $400 
million in funding to support local, re-
gional, 
and 
socially 
disadvantaged 
farmers. This is dedicated funding that 
will go directly toward local producers 
and local and regional food systems to 
help revitalize the essential farming 
that makes America proud. 
I was also pleased that the adminis-
tration included Secretary Vilsack in 
its new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force. This will address the unfair 
trade practices that have allowed for 
cheap and unjust agriculture labor 
practices to continue at home and 
abroad. 
They have allowed large agriculture 
companies to thrive and put their food 
all over grocers’ shelves, while our

to increase domestic competitiveness 
is what our small family farmers need 
to regain their footing and make it

I hope my colleagues will join me in

CLIMATE CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTER
of 
Louisiana). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. CASTEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of our 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
CASTOR), my friend and the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding to 
me. 
Mr. Speaker, we are in a climate cri-
sis, and it is going to take American 
leadership and ingenuity to solve it. 
But we think we can create jobs and a 
lot of opportunity when we solve the 
climate crisis. But what we are seeing 
right now are devastating health and 
economic 
consequences 
of 
climate 
change here all across America, wheth-
er it is wildfires out West, flooding in 
the midsection. We are approaching 
hurricane season with great trepi-
dation. Extreme heat. 
We have got to act urgently, guided 
by the science, working in concert with 
our allies across the globe to provide a 
livable climate for all Americans, espe-
cially for future generations. 
We have got to harness the techno-
logical innovation of the Moon Shot. 
We have got to harness the creativity 
of our entrepreneurs, the strength of 
our workers, and the moral force of 
this great Nation that is working to es-
tablish justice for all. Because I believe 
that, working together, we will be able 
to avert the worst impacts of this cli-
mate emergency and build a stronger, 
healthier, fairer America. 
b 1945 
But let’s look at what is happening 
right now. People know this. The last 7 
years were the hottest on record. You 
don’t have to tell that to the folks out 
West 
right 
now. 
They 
are 
living 
through some of the hottest days—the 
hottest, driest days. 
This is a departure from the 20th cen-
tury 
average 
temperature. 
It 
just 
seems like these hotter days, the 
longer, hotter summers, are more fre-
quent. And the science tells us that is 
true. 
Why is this happening? Carbon diox-
ide in the atmosphere is at record lev-
els. People thought that, during the 
pandemic, greenhouse gases would dip 
and that might provide some salvation 
from the worst impacts of climate. 
But, see, these gases build up in the at-
mosphere. You don’t get a bonus for 
any year. 
In fact, NOAA, the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, has 
said no, despite the pandemic, carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere is at a 
record high. 
This creates enormous costs on fami-
lies and businesses here in America but 
also all across the planet. It impacts 
the air we breathe. It creates very se-
vere health consequences. Think about 
the folks who have to work outside in 
the extreme heat and more polluted air 
while coming out of a pandemic. 
Then, there is the cost, not just to 
the bottom line of the Federal budget, 
but the cost to all of us. In fact, last 
year alone, we suffered through about 
$100 billion, $96 billion, in damages 
from weather and climate disasters. 
That is just 1 year. 
This is an enormous wake-up call for 
our great country and people all across 
the planet. We have waited too long to 
take ambitious action. The time is 
now. The time is urgent. 
We don’t have any more time for half 
measures, so we intend now to hammer 
out the most ambitious climate legis-
lation that we have ever seen in order 
to answer the moral call that we have 
to future generations to make sure we 
give them a livable planet. 
Mr. Speaker, we are joined tonight 
by a number of colleagues, who are 
going to speak from the heart and 
speak with great intelligence to pro-
vide a little science, a little know-how. 
I am really proud to stand with them 
on the floor of the House tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, 
Congressman CASTEN, for bringing his 
intellect and his passion for solving the 
climate crisis to this Congress. It is 
needed now more than ever. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for her words and her 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. CASTEN for yielding. And thank 
you to Chair CASTOR, chair of the Se-
lect Committee on the Climate Crisis, 
for her leadership throughout this 
process. It really has been science- 
based and meaningful. 
Mr. Speaker, as we work to build 
back better, we have not just the op-
portunity but the imperative to take 
bold climate action. By strengthening 
investments in climate-centric infra-
structure, we can create good-paying 
jobs, reduce emissions, and support 
frontline communities. 
Last month, I had this great oppor-
tunity. I got to ride on a new electric 
bus at Meadow Park Middle School in 
Beaverton, Oregon. Thanks to the 
Portland General Electric’s School Bus 
Electrification Project, the Beaverton 
School District is working to electrify 
its bus fleet. 
The electric buses are quieter; they 
are less expensive to maintain; and, 
importantly, they reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. This is good for the 
health of our children, our community, 
and our planet. We can and must help 
more school districts and transpor-
tation systems electrify not just in Or-
egon but across the country. 
With the American Jobs Plan, we can 
create millions of good-paying jobs, 
combat the climate crisis, revitalize 
American manufacturing, and make 
long-overdue investments in our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. 
As the House works to advance the 
American Jobs Plan, we can use as a 
roadmap the climate action plan from 
the Select Committee on the Climate 
Crisis. 
Our 
bold, 
comprehensive 
science-based 
plan 
includes 
invest-
ments in zero-emissions buses, transit, 
electric vehicle charging stations, and 
pedestrian and bike infrastructure, all 
to decarbonize our transportation sec-
tor. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to give credit to 
Chairman DEFAZIO, my wonderful col-
league from Oregon, for his leadership. 
He has included many of these provi-
sions in his surface transportation re-
authorization, 
the 
Investment 
in 
America Act. I look forward to sup-
porting it when it comes to the floor in 
the coming weeks. 
Mr. Speaker, I tell my colleagues 
that climate-resilient infrastructure is 
about much more than just roads and 
bridges. June is National Ocean Month, 
and as co-chair of the House Ocean 
Caucus and the Congressional Estuary 
Caucus, I want to highlight how the 
power of our ocean can and must be 
part of the solution, which is recog-
nized in our plan for solving the cli-
mate crisis. 
I recently led a bipartisan group of 
colleagues in calling for a $10 billion 
investment in coastal restoration and 
resilience projects in the American 
Jobs Plan, and I look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues to deliver these 
needed investments to coastal commu-
nities. 
Addressing the climate crisis pre-
sents an economic opportunity, a tre-
mendous economic opportunity. We 
can create millions of good-paying, 
high-quality union jobs that will help 
working families and displaced workers 
recover from the economic collapse 
caused by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Jobs Plan 
meets the moment to not only build 
back but to build back better. By ad-
vancing the American Jobs Plan, we 
have 
a 
once-in-a-generation 
oppor-
tunity to rebuild a resilient clean en-
ergy economy, create good-paying jobs 
to boost our economic recovery, and 
begin to repair the legacy of environ-
mental racism and pollution that has

disproportionately 
burdened 
low-in-
come communities and communities of 
color for decades. 
As we build the infrastructure of the 
future, we cannot repeat the injustices 
of the past. Instead, we must pass and 
implement 
comprehensive 
climate 
policies, such as those set out in the 
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis’ climate action plan. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CARBAJAL), my friend and one of the 
funnier 
Members 
of 
Congress, 
but 
heartfelt today. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, going 
back to my days as the county super-
visor, I fought to make sure the Cen-
tral Coast was a leader in the clean en-
ergy economy. I helped get the first 
large-scale solar project in Santa Bar-
bara County across the finish line and 
called it a win-win-win. That is because 
investing in renewables is one of the 
best investments we can make. It 
means a healthy planet, clean air, and 
good-paying jobs. 
Since 2014, the Central Coast has 
emerged as a renewable energy power-
house. We are now home to several 
major solar farms, and soon, we could 
be home to one of the largest battery 
storage plants in the world. 
After years of negotiation, I helped 
secure an agreement to realize an off-
shore wind project and the jobs it will 
create for the Central Coast. According 
to a study conducted by a local organi-
zation called REACH, this project 
alone could create 650 good-paying jobs 
and generate $262 million in revenue 
each year. 
Renewable energy is also a vital tool 
to address the climate crisis. Some 
claim 
renewable 
energy 
funding 
doesn’t belong in an infrastructure 
package. I say modernizing our energy 
infrastructure and tackling the climate 
crisis go hand in hand. 
Last year, the U.S. spent nearly $100 
billion responding to extreme weather 
events and disasters fueled by climate 
change. Instead of rebuilding each time 
a disaster strikes, we need to be 
proactive to keep our communities safe 
from the realities of climate change. 
That means weatherizing millions of 
homes, retrofitting buildings, and shor-
ing up our water infrastructure. 
We also must curb emissions in the 
transportation sector, which is respon-
sible for 29 percent of our greenhouse 
gas emissions. If we want to tackle cli-
mate change, the transportation sector 
must be part of the solution. 
The measures included in President 
Biden’s American Jobs Plan will mod-
ernize our transportation system to do 
just that. It will create millions of jobs 
in the auto industry building electric 
vehicles and expanding our network of 
electric vehicle charging stations. 
Transitioning away from fossil fuels 
to renewable energy is also an environ-
mental justice issue. Sadly, minority 
communities 
are 
disproportionately 
impacted by air pollution. For exam-
ple, Latino Americans are exposed to 11 
percent more fine particulate pollution 
compared to the average American. 
Burning fossil fuels pollutes our air 
and destroys our planet. We cannot af-
ford inaction any longer. We also can-
not afford to pass up the opportunity 
to create millions of good-paying jobs 
that will propel our economy forward. 
It is time for Congress to pass a bold 
infrastructure plan that protects our 
planet, air quality, and economy. 
As we on the Central Coast know, in-
vesting in clean energy is a win-win- 
win. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LEVIN), my friend and a distinguished 
member of the Select Committee on 
Climate Crisis. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my good friend from Illi-
nois, and I thank Chairwoman CASTOR 
for her exceptional leadership of our 
select committee. 
My colleagues have done a good job 
so far of explaining why we need ambi-
tious climate action that follows the 
science and meets the scale of the chal-
lenge we face. However, I would high-
light one climate impact that is par-
ticularly important in the area I rep-
resent. 
My district encompasses more than 
50 miles of coastline in southern Cali-
fornia, North County San Diego, South 
Orange County. Our coasts are a huge 
part of our communities. They drive 
our economies and are critical to our 
way of life. But sea level rise threatens 
all of this. It is accelerating the ero-
sion of our coasts, which washes away 
beaches and threatens critical infra-
structure, like the Los Angeles-San 
Diego-San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor, 
also known as the LOSSAN Corridor. 
The LOSSAN Corridor is the second 
busiest intercity passenger rail cor-
ridor in the United States and the busi-
est 
State-supported 
Amtrak 
route, 
with nearly 3 million inner-city pas-
sengers and 5 million commuter pas-
sengers each year. $1 billion in goods 
and services are also supported by the 
rail line. 
At the same time, coastal erosion 
threatens the bluffs that run along our 
coasts in San Diego County. Bluff col-
lapses have, tragically, taken the lives 
of eight people in our communities in 
recent years. 
The impacts of climate change in 
coastal southern California are not 
theoretical. We see and experience 
them every single day. I strongly be-
lieve that we must take ambitious ac-
tion to make our country more resil-
ient 
to 
climate 
impacts 
while 
transitioning to a zero-carbon future, 
and we must do it now. We must do it 
now. 
With President Biden’s American 
Jobs Plan, we have a once-in-a-genera-
tion opportunity to do so. The Amer-
ican Jobs Plan, as proposed by the 
President, advances real climate solu-
tions that will make a difference in the 
lives of our constituents. It will put us 
on the path to meeting the challenge 
presented by the climate crisis while 
creating 2.7 million new jobs, the jobs 
of tomorrow in clean energy, the jobs 
that will help us compete on the global 
stage. Those are the jobs we need. 
The American Jobs Plan will create 
them, but in order to achieve these 
goals, in order to pass the American 
Jobs Plan as intended by the President, 
we must not abandon the key climate 
provisions and investments that the 
President proposed in his version of the 
plan. The package must deliver on the 
promise to put our country on the path 
to a 100 percent carbon-free energy 
powered electricity grid by 2035. 
We can do this if we include strong 
tax policies that incentivize renewable 
energy generation. We can do this if we 
include clean energy and energy effi-
ciency standards that promote renew-
able energy and reduce electricity use. 
We can do this if we include the poli-
cies and funding to electrify cars, 
buses, and buildings. And we must in-
clude the transportation sector. It is 
the largest source of greenhouse gas 
emissions in the country. 
We need significant investment to 
incentivize the sale of zero-emission 
vehicles. Specifically, we must ensure 
that 100 percent of new light-duty vehi-
cle sales are zero emissions by 2035, as 
envisioned under the Zero-Emission 
Vehicles Act that I introduced last 
Congress with Senator JEFF MERKLEY. 
b 2000 
Moreover, the build-out of zero emis-
sion vehicle fueling and charging infra-
structure must go hand in hand with 
the deployment of the vehicles them-
selves, which is why I strongly support 
the President’s vision for 500,000 new 
charging stations across the country. 
The American Jobs Plan provides us 
a pathway to finally achieve these 
goals and to lead the world when it 
comes to vehicle electrification. So 
without these key climate provisions, 
it is hard to imagine supporting any 
package that comes before this Cham-
ber for consideration. 
I am eager to help advance a strong 
American Jobs Plan that employs our 
communities, 
follows 
the 
climate 
science, and matches the scale of the 
challenge we face. I know my col-
leagues here feel the same. 
Now is our opportunity to get this 
done. It is an opportunity that we must 
seize. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAP-
TUR), whom I am delighted was able to 
make time in a busy appropriation sea-
son to come down and join us today. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my very able colleague, Con-
gressman CASTEN, for the opportunity 
to join him and Congresswoman CAS-
TOR, the leaders of this marvelous com-
mittee on climate change. I thank 
them very much for leading our coun-
try and world in this regard. 
My goal as chair of the House Energy 
and Water Subcommittee is to help 
them and help our generation embrace

a better future for those that will fol-
low. We must sustain life on Earth. Let 
us all help our country and world meet 
the challenges as we face the dawn of 
this new climate change era. 
The clean energy future of our Na-
tion and our ability to reboot and re-
energize the domestic manufacturing 
economy depends on climate-related 
infrastructure programs for inventing 
that new future. Addressing climate 
change will create and even bring back 
good paying jobs right here at home. 
Addressing climate change is our por-
tal to sustain life on Earth for genera-
tions to come. 
Headlines coast to coast, as others 
have referenced, tell part of the story. 
Yes, the Earth is warming. The rate of 
increase for damaging weather events 
is unrelenting. Each of us, and each of 
our districts, have personally experi-
enced the impacts of this historic 
change. If we fail to address the has-
tening crisis, it is to our collective 
peril. 
As a small first step, I would urge 
every American who may be listening 
to plant trees. Yes, everyone can do 
something. A first simple step is to 
plant a tree to capture the carbon that 
is already in the air, and the tree will 
produce oxygen to help you breathe, 
and to help your children breathe and 
your neighbors. It is amazing what 
happens. 
Cleveland, Ohio, used to be known as 
‘‘forest city.’’ We have a big job to do 
in replanting many of the trees that 
have aged-out over the years, and mak-
ing Cleveland, and places like it, a 
much more oxygen-rich community. 
Addressing climate change will help 
human health. As America stands at a 
crossroads in this new energy age, we 
must ensure that infrastructure in-
cludes strategic investments in energy, 
clean energy, climate, and water re-
sources innovation. 
Technologies and innovation driven 
by the Department of Energy are al-
ready 
helping 
to 
address 
climate 
change. They already have markedly 
driven down the cost of wind, solar, en-
ergy storage, and efficient lightbulbs 
by 60 to 95 percent just since 2008, and 
we are not done yet. They have led to 
widespread deployment and consumer 
savings. 
New innovations will lead to new op-
portunities. In my own home region, I 
was very pleased to be at the birth of a 
company called First Solar, now the 
largest in the Nation, invented locally 
using cadmium-telluride technology. 
And now, just recently in the past 
month, First Solar has announced the 
hiring of an additional 500 new employ-
ees in good jobs to match the thou-
sands they already employ, to meet an 
unmet market demand. 
Reversing the impacts of climate 
change will create good paying jobs 
like these across every State in our 
country. Already there are more Amer-
icans working in energy efficiency and 
energy production than as waiters and 
waitresses. Think about that. That is 
in a very short time, and more jobs to 
come. We must continue to innovate 
and lead in these areas, so our Nation 
is not left behind. As people in commu-
nities succeed, so will America. As 
someone said to me, Marcy, what 
America makes, makes America. My, 
gosh, do I agree with that. 
The Biden administration has been 
clear from day one about the need to 
urgently address the climate crisis, and 
I am excited that the President’s 
American Jobs Plan will create new 
jobs by reinvesting in areas and work-
ers too often left behind, and they will 
help save our planet and sustain all of 
us and those who will follow us. 
We cannot lose sight of the impor-
tance of including climate-related and 
job-creating proposals in any infra-
structure package. In fact, any pack-
age that aims to build back better 
must do that. Climate change can be 
addressed by every community across 
our country. Innovation, intelligence, 
and environmental patriotism should 
drive this new national imperative. 
As we watch President Joe Biden in 
his foreign trip meet the leaders of de-
mocracies across Europe this week, we 
watch America lead these democracies 
of the world in protecting Mother 
Earth for those who will follow us. 
It really is a daunting time, but it is 
also an inspiring time. And any time 
America has ever set a goal, it has al-
ways achieved it. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take some time now to rise to 
talk about something that I have 
talked about—some would say too 
much—on this floor. To yet, again, dis-
cuss the grave threat and the massive 
opportunity that is the climate crisis. 
Even as we talk right now about the 
necessity of limiting global warming to 
less than 11⁄2 degrees Celsius, let’s fol-
low the math; the planet has already 
warmed by 1 degree, we only have 1⁄2 
degree to go. The last 7 years were the 
hottest ever on record. Even in spite of 
the pandemic, global levels of carbon 
dioxide have hit record levels. In fact, 
the last time CO2 levels were as high as 
they are right now was 4 million years 
ago. Sea levels were 50 feet higher. 
That is the reality of what happens 
when heat melts ice, ice dumps water. 
This is the reality we have made. 
If we are to be judged by our works 
and we do nothing more in this mo-
ment, that judgment will not be pret-
ty. That is our challenge and it is our 
opportunity. 
But this change in CO2 levels didn’t 
happen over a million years, it didn’t 
happen over a thousand years, it didn’t 
even happen over a hundred years. Half 
of all the CO2 we have ever emitted as 
a species since that first fire that some 
upright hominid built in a cave a mil-
lion years ago, half of all the CO2 we 
have ever emitted was since 1990. That 
is within my lifetime. It is within the 
lifetime of almost all of the Members 
of this body. 
That is nearly a century after Svante 
Arrhenius discovered the greenhouse 
effect, since the science was basically 
settled; 100 years after the photovoltaic 
effect that was invented that powers 
solar panels today; and more than a 
decade after the fossil fuel companies 
knew about climate change and de-
cided to promote misinformation in-
stead of acting. 
In 1989, when the U.N. formed the 
IPCC, when Ronald Reagan’s EPA said, 
we need to create a global cap and 
trade program to reduce a global pol-
lutant—to protect the ozone hole, 
chlorofluorocarbons. When that same 
EPA and the subsequent George Bush— 
both Republican Presidents, I would 
add—they said, let’s take that same 
model and apply it to a domestic pol-
lutant, acid-rain forming compounds. 
We have sugar maples in New Eng-
land because of their leadership. We 
have a shrinking ozone hole because of 
their leadership. When they did that at 
the end of the 1980s, we were on the 
right track 30 years ago. What do we 
have to do now to turn this ship 
around? 
The heck of it is, we know what we 
have to do to reduce our emissions and 
we know how to do it, building out 
clean energy infrastructure, creating 
and building wind turbines, solar pan-
els. Building big things is what Amer-
ica is good at. We do not need to be 
constrained by our ambition, my good-
ness. 
When the New Deal was passed, we 
electrified 80 percent of rural America 
in just 15 years. I would like to think 
our capabilities are even greater now. 
Let’s embrace that opportunity. The 
hard questions in this line of work are 
the zero sum ones. 
How do you allocate wins to some 
parties when they imply a loss to an-
other? That is not climate. 
The hard questions in clean energy 
policy are not how we allocate the 
pains of this transition; they are how 
we allocate the gains of this transition. 
Clean energy is cheap energy. If you 
don’t believe me, ask anyone with a 
solar panel on their roof how much 
they paid for electricity yesterday. Ask 
anybody with a coal plant, they know 
that number. 
The clean energy transition means it 
is a win for the folks who get to go to 
work building more efficient buildings 
and wind turbines and solar panels. It 
is a win for every American. 
I’ve polled this. 100 percent of Ameri-
cans like to pay less for energy. They 
would all win. 100 percent of Americans 
like cleaner air. They will all win. 100 
percent of Americans do not want to 
live on a coast that is flooding or for-
ests that are on fire or derechos that 
are coming across the Midwest. 
Our obligation is to seize this chance 
and to make sure—this is a hard prob-
lem, but it is a good problem—to make 
sure that those gains are equitably dis-
tributed throughout our society. 
The President’s infrastructure pro-
posal is just that. It isn’t just a chance 
for clean energy, it is a make-or-break

opportunity to finally do what is sci-
entifically necessary before it is too 
late. 
Proposals like a clean energy stand-
ard, a build-out of electric trans-
mission lines, requirements for pur-
chases of clean energy will help send 
our emissions from the electric sector 
to zero and will be the bedrock of a new 
clean economy. 
Cutting some or—let’s be ambitious— 
all of the $650 billion a year that the 
IMF has said that we currently sub-
sidize the fossil fuel industry, will fi-
nally give us efficient markets in our 
energy sector. $650 billion—that is 
about how much we spend on Med-
icaid—subsidizing an energy that can’t 
compete under a free market. 
So help make lives better for hun-
dreds of millions of Americans now and 
in the decades to come. 
Now 12 years ago, when Waxman- 
Markey was the debate du jour, we let 
an opportunity to act on the climate 
crisis pass us by. Since that time, we 
have kept emitting and temperatures 
have kept rising. 
I told you, I have given this speech a 
few too many times. I don’t want to be 
giving this speech a year from now. I 
don’t particularly want to be giving it 
tomorrow. I certainly don’t want to be 
giving it 12 years from now. 
We have a chance now to act while 
our planet can still afford it, and we 
can embrace that because our wallets 
are going to love it. 
Before I took this job, when I was 
running a clean energy company, I had 
a board member who gave me a piece of 
advice that has always stuck with me, 
he said: In the end, the only thing that 
really matters in this life is whether 
your grandchildren can say they were 
proud of you. Let’s be clear. Our grand-
children are not going to be proud of 
us. They are not going to pat us on the 
back for doing only what was politi-
cally possible. They don’t care. 
What matters is, did we do what was 
scientifically necessary? And I have a 
lot of colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, on both sides of this building, 
who will say, You are naive, CASTEN, 
what is necessary is so far in excess of 
what is politically possible, we just 
can’t do that. 
If that is your approach to this mo-
ment, the only thing I know for certain 
is you are not cut out for leadership. 
Our moment, our challenge in this mo-
ment, is to make what is necessary 
possible, it is all that matters. Because 
while the best chance for climate ac-
tion was 30 years ago, our last chance 
is now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
b 2015 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, to my 
colleague and my neighbor from Illi-
nois (Mr. CASTEN), I thank him for his 
leadership on this issue, his experience 
in sharing his perspective, and his call 
to action. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue 
to raise the alarm about the rapidly ac-
celerating consequences of the climate 
crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago in 1989 I 
married the love of my life. When we 
got married, we looked to the future. 
We thought about having a family. We 
have two sons who are today 28 and 26. 
We still look to the future and hope 
they will have a chance to raise a fam-
ily. But that is in doubt because we 
face a climate crisis. 
The climate crisis is the most press-
ing threat to our children’s future and 
our grandchildren’s future. It is a 
threat to our Nation and to everything 
we hold dear. It is an existential threat 
to our way of life, and we have to take 
urgent action now. 
We are already seeing the con-
sequences of climate change through-
out our country in our local commu-
nities, whether it is the case of more 
intense forest fires that are starting 
earlier in the year, 100-year rainstorms 
that cause floods, not every 100 years 
but every other year, or more intense 
hurricanes and also droughts that are 
devastating much of our West. 
These are the consequences we are 
facing today, and they are putting our 
Nation at risk. We have to do every-
thing we can to protect our commu-
nities, to protect our Nation, to pro-
tect our world, and to protect our chil-
dren’s future. 
That is why it is so important that 
we pass the President’s American Jobs 
Plan, that we invest in infrastructure, 
and that we do it in a way that builds 
resiliency against a changing climate 
but plans for a future to address and 
protect our climate. 
There are many sources of the green-
house gases causing global warming, 
everything from industry to industrial 
and commercial buildings, our resi-
dences, but, of course, transportation 
is the greatest source, and among that 
is air travel. 
Airline travel is a growing part of 
our future, but it is contributing up to 
21⁄2 percent of our total emissions of 
carbon. Air travel has changed the 
world. It has brought us closer to-
gether. It is necessary for us to con-
tinue to have the hope for a 21st cen-
tury global economy. But it is impera-
tive that we work to address the im-
pact. 
That is why, among the many other 
bills I have helped work for and sup-
port in this Congress to address cli-
mate change, I am proud to have intro-
duced the Sustainable Skies Act, legis-
lation that will cut the carbon of 
greenhouse gas emissions of airline 
fuels by as much as or more than 50 
percent. It will boost the use of sus-
tainable aviation fuel to make airline 
travel something that will be a part of 
a sustainable future. 
This legislation is the single most 
important step in the aviation industry 
that they can take to lower carbon 
emissions and to fight climate change. 
At the same time, sustainable aviation 
fuel will also enable more travel and 
commerce. It is, as Mr. CASTEN said, a 
win-win. It is good for everybody. It is 
good for our present, it is good for our 
future, and it is good for our children. 
The facts could not be clearer: cli-
mate change is a serious threat to our 
economy, our national security, the 
planet, and the future that we pass on 
to our children. We must take action 
before it is too late. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from the great State 
of New Mexico (Ms. STANSBURY), whose 
reputation has preceded her during her 
short tenure. 
Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on this historic day in which we passed 
and sent to the President’s desk the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act. It seems appropriate that we 
should also take a moment now to talk 
about climate justice as we are also 
talking about racial justice in our 
country. 
Because the science is clear, we must 
urgently address the issues of climate 
change now. We must address the 
causes of climate change and our 
greenhouse gas footprint. We must 
mitigate the impacts of climate change 
and lift up and support our commu-
nities. And we must build a world that 
is more just, more equitable, and more 
climate resilient. To do so, we must in-
vest in our communities, investing in 
their future, and investing in critical 
infrastructure that will make that pos-
sible. 
The time is now to be decisive, to be 
brave in our policymaking, to be bold 
in our investments, and to lean into 
the science. This is especially critical 
for New Mexico, my home State, where 
we are already experiencing the im-
pacts of extreme drought, catastrophic 
fires, and an uncertain future. 
I have spent my working career 
working on these issues, and I know 
that we must invest in infrastructure 
like our electric grid, broadband infra-
structure, drinking water, irrigation, 
and green infrastructure so that our 
communities can remain resilient as 
we are going through this change and 
to ensure that we are taking full ad-
vantage and leaning into our clean en-
ergy future. 
We must do all of this through the 
lens of social, racial, and economic jus-
tice by investing in good paying jobs 
and in the livelihoods and well-being of 
our communities and our people. 
That is why we need the American 
Jobs Plan now and the investments 
that are not only going to be shovel 
ready, but, as a friend of mine says, 
also shovel worthy. So the time is now 
to take action on climate change and 
to ensure that we are investing in the 
infrastructure that will make it pos-
sible for future generations to live re-
siliently on this planet. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
again to gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. CASTOR), who is the chair of the 
Select Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker,

passion and such intellect really does 
give me hope that we have the tools 
necessary to tackle the climate crisis. 
But I think we also need to think 
about climate as a climate oppor-
tunity, and there are a few of these. 
Our 
newest 
colleague, 
Congress-
woman STANSBURY from New Mexico 
kind of hit on it. And it goes back to— 
I want to thank Mr. CASTEN—last year 
before the pandemic hit, Mr. CASTEN 
was kind enough to invite me to Chi-
cago where we heard from environ-
mental justice leaders. I also had the 
opportunity to travel to Detroit. I have 
listened to folks who are demanding 
greater equity all across America. 
Back home in Tampa, Florida, I see 
it; I understand that now the climate 
crisis presents us with a generational 
opportunity to rebuild our country and 
our infrastructure, so we are not leav-
ing communities behind and we are not 
leaving any American behind. 
We can hammer out these invest-
ments that will help us rebuild the 
economy. Mr. CASTEN knows these ex-
amples quite well. 
Decades ago, unfortunately, the Fed-
eral Government put interstate high-
ways right through the center of many 
communities. The harms from the pol-
lution still linger today. In fact, Black 
Americans are exposed to 21 percent 
more fine, particulate matter pollution 
than the average American. I just don’t 
think we can pass an infrastructure 
package that ignores these injustices. 
We are going to have to create these 
new opportunities in solving the cli-
mate crisis, creating good paying jobs, 
but also lifting up Americans and 
American communities that have car-
ried the burden of pollution. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I am re-
minded as I listen to the gentlewoman 
speak—I know our whip always likes to 
quote George Santayana who said that 
those who don’t study their history are 
doomed to repeat it. 
We are at the cusp—it has probably 
already started—of the third great en-
ergy transition we have had as a spe-
cies. The first one was when we 
transitioned from depending on muscle 
power to mechanical power. The second 
was when we transitioned from me-
chanical power to electric power, and 
this transition from dirty energy to 
clean energy. Every one of those tran-
sitions has been a massive boon in 
labor productivity. It takes a lot fewer 
people to run a steam shovel than it 
does John Henrys to dig a hole in the 
ground, and it takes a lot fewer people 
when you can electrify the country to 
build all the industries that we have 
grown accustomed to than it does when 
you have to live within a pulley’s 
length of the waterwheel. 
With those opportunities have come 
all that we think of as great and truly 
American. We have freed up people’s 
time to invest in whole new ideas and 
take away the drudgery of work. But 
the history we have to acknowledge is 
that every one of those transitions has 
also been extremely disruptive for the 
people involved. 
I like to tell folks back home that 
only a Luddite would say we never 
should have invented the steam shovel. 
But you have to be deeply evil not to 
empathize with John Henry. 
As we go through this transition that 
we are in right now, we are going to 
create a tremendous amount of wealth 
because we are going to grow labor pro-
ductivity again. We are going to have 
the opportunity, as many people al-
ready do, to generate electricity with-
out depending on coal mines and coal 
railroad lines and natural gas pipe-
lines, and, Mr. Speaker, you are going 
to be able to do this on your roof from 
the sun or from the wind or from more 
efficient geothermal. That is going to 
free up a whole lot of time to do a lot 
of innovative things. But it is going to 
be disruptive for a lot of communities. 
There is no doubt that there is a ris-
ing tide of wealth that is already upon 
us. There is also no doubt that not all 
rising tides lift all boats. Tsunamis 
tend to swamp them out sometimes, 
and in the tsunami of wealth creation 
that is coming down, let’s make sure 
that we look out for the least among 
us. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I think that is one of the reasons why 
President Biden’s American Jobs Plan 
targets 40 percent of the benefits of our 
clean energy and clean infrastructure 
investments to disadvantaged commu-
nities. I think that is smart policy. 
I think the gentleman is right. Right 
now, as we move into our clean energy 
future, President Biden has the goal of 
really helping communities that need 
revitalization. When you think about 
the hard work in a coal mine or out in 
the field, we owe such a debt of grati-
tude to our coal miners and the energy 
workers who have powered America. 
They have made it what it is over the 
last century. They ushered in the eco-
nomic progress that we enjoy today. 
But we now know, according to the 
science, that our overdependence on 
coal and fossil fuels and fracked gas 
has led to a crisis that now threatens 
our way of life. I wish it weren’t so, but 
we have to now, at this fork in the 
road, decide that our moral obligation 
to future generations comes first. 
With all of the opportunities that 
clean energy and greater and stronger 
and healthier communities can pro-
vide, we have got to hammer this out 
through the American Jobs Plan and 
make sure that we protect our econ-
omy, we protect our national security, 
our health, our beautiful natural re-
sources from sea to shining sea, and 
the air that we breathe. 
But we have some choices to make. 
We can double down on the status quo, 
even as these climate-fueled disasters 
claim more lives and they hurt the 
pocketbooks of folks. 
I think of my neighbors back home in 
Florida now, the so-called Sunshine 
State. Boy, we have a lot of work to do 
to capture the power of the sun 
through solar energy, but we are pay-
ing more now because we have longer 
and hotter summers, it means AC bills 
are going up. 
We have these intense flood events, 
so we are paying more for flood insur-
ance and stormwater costs. Meanwhile 
a lot of these energy companies have 
kind of gotten off the hook over time. 
What does the gentleman say about 
that? 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I think 
there is a refreshing change coming in 
our energy structure primarily because 
all of those old power plants—that 
some of the utilities in Florida that we 
are fighting because they still have all 
that capital they wanted to amortize— 
those plants are getting old, and they 
are making the decisions that intel-
ligent businesses always make: I am 
going to invest in the stuff that is 
clean and that generates a high return. 
Florida Power & Light Company is a 
utility that, frankly, has been one of 
the leaders in deploying wind energy. 
It took them a little while to do it in 
their own district, but they certainly 
did it all over the country, because 
they knew that was a good place to put 
their investors’ money to work. And we 
have seen that leadership, I think, 
throughout the business sector in this 
country. There is a reason why we are 
creating so many more solar jobs, and 
so many more wind jobs. Jobs in the 
energy efficiency sector I think is the 
largest supplier of new labor. 
b 2030 
But I don’t think that absolves us as 
regulators. 
I am remembering when you and I 
formed what I think we thought was 
going to be a vary small delegation to 
Madrid a little over a year ago; and we 
had our pins that said ‘‘We’re Still In,’’ 
because we knew, of course, that the 
prior administration had pulled out of 
the Paris accord. And I still have a pic-
ture that I carry around and show to 
people of the two empty seats in front 
of the United States delegation sign 
when every other country in the world 
was there. 
But I remember there was a—and I 
wish I could remember the name—Eu-
ropean parliamentarian that came up 
to me and said: You know, we know 
from experience that when the United 
States doesn’t lead, bad things happen. 
And I said that we thought we were 
alone out there. But you remember 
when we got there, there were a lot of 
businesses that were there and there 
were lot of cities that were there. We 
spent a long time at a lot of university 
booths. And we were still in because we 
were still in, not just because it was a 
slogan on a pin; because all those com-
panies that made zero carbon commit-
ments and are committing to it be-
cause their shareholders are demanding 
it. 
One-third of all of the assets under 
management in global equity markets 
right now are in ESG funds. People 
care. They don’t—whether they care 
for moral reasons, whether they care 
because they are greedy, it doesn’t 
matter. They care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2879 
June 16, 2021 
We have had over 1,200 State and 
local officials call on Congress to pass 
the American Jobs Plan because they 
care. Environmental and labor organi-
zations across the country have pushed 
for us to act now because they care. 
I am reading in the Tampa Bay 
Times. Recently, Dr. Rich Templin 
says: ‘‘Everyone who stands for fair, 
union jobs and climate action can 
come together. In this plan, pro-work-
ers and pro-environment voices can 
sing in unison.’’ 
We know that is true. 
Now, the challenge—you started by 
asking about the energy sector. If we 
are really honest, what we all know in 
this line of work that we are in is that 
losers always cry louder than winners 
cheer. 
People who have got a loss of invest-
ment in this space know exactly what 
they have to lose. Future generations 
aren’t here yet. 
Our job here today is to look around 
the room and see who is not in the 
room and make sure we advocate for 
them. The rest of them are doing a 
pretty good job on their own, I think. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
well, what has been so fascinating is 
there are so many people in the room 
because they understand the opportu-
nities, the job-creating opportunities 
through the American Jobs Plan. 
Here we go. The American Jobs Plan 
will create 2.7 million new jobs. So let’s 
talk about some of those jobs. I think 
about some of our colleagues who rep-
resent communities that have seen jobs 
go overseas over time, our industrial 
base. 
We know what President Biden has 
proposed will help revitalize those 
communities; plug those abandoned 
coal mines; plug the abandoned wells; 
just plain plug the leaks of methane 
gas that are so damaging to the cli-
mate. 
We think we can create millions and 
millions of jobs through a new CCC, a 
Climate Conservation Corps. We can 
strengthen our communities at home. I 
know we have got a lot of seawalls that 
need repair, a lot of replanting of trees 
and mangroves to help protect us from 
these very costly events. We know we 
need to modernize the electric grid 
across America. 
Representative CASTEN, that is going 
to create an enormous amount of jobs 
in the Midwest because a lot of the re-
newable resources, your solar power, 
wind power, it is largely in the Mid-
west. We have got to build the modern 
electric grid. 
Look at this horrendous catastrophe 
in Texas just a few months ago because 
the electric grid there was not con-
nected. It wasn’t modernized. It wasn’t 
resilient. People lost their lives be-
cause of the strange, climate-fueled 
winter storm in Texas. 
We are going to create a lot of jobs 
just modernizing and making the grid 
more resilient. And I haven’t even got-
ten to the wind power, offshore wind, 
wind in the Midwest. 
This is our future. This is why I like 
to think of it not just in the terms of 
a climate crisis, but a climate oppor-
tunity. And I think that is why Presi-
dent Biden says that every time he 
hears people talk climate, he hears 
jobs, jobs, jobs. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, when we 
deregulated our power industry in 1992, 
with the energy policy act, that was 
never presented as being an environ-
mental bill, as far as I can remember. 
It was designed to encourage people to 
build cheaper power. 
And what did they build? 
The nuclear industry went from run-
ning 60 percent of the time to running 
90 percent of the time. We started 
building a whole lot of wind and solar. 
We basically stopped building ineffi-
cient gas plants, and the only new gas 
plants were combined cycle plants that 
are almost twice as efficient. 
Since that bill was passed, the CO2 
emissions in our power sector have fall-
en from 1,300 pounds a megawatt hour 
to 900, and the price of power has fallen 
by 6 percent. 
Now, there are those who say that is 
because of the fracking revolution. And 
there are people who say a lot of 
things, I guess. It happened because ec-
onomics drives clean energy. 
You know what people didn’t build 
since 1992? 
Coal. It is a really lousy investment. 
In just those 10 years, after 1992, we 
built 200,000 megawatts of new gas tur-
bine capacity. Twenty percent of the 
entire U.S. power grid, which was twice 
as efficient as what it displaced, was 
built in response to economic signals 
and drove down the CO2 emissions of 
the grid. That is a start. 
For us to do what we have to do from 
this point going forward, we have to 
electrify everything. We have to figure 
out how to electrify our transportation 
fleet; electrify the way our factories 
make goods and services, how our 
homes keep us warm. 
In order to do that, we need to build 
at 
least 
1,000 
gigawatts; 
1,000 
megawatts; 1,000 kilowatts—whatever 
unit you would like—of new genera-
tion. That is about as much as genera-
tion as we already have in this coun-
try. 
We are then going to need to build 
the wires to connect that up to all the 
new loads. And I think as we heard at 
a climate hearing, they said that is 
going to take at least $350 billion of in-
vestment. And those investments are 
going to make money because people 
are now connecting up a cheaper en-
ergy source that is giving people what 
they really want, which isn’t elec-
tricity. 
What people really want is a hot 
shower and a cold beer, and it is going 
to give them that cheaper. 
It is going to help us build out elec-
tric vehicle charging stations. We are 
talking about massive amounts of pub-
lic—and 
private-sector 
investments 
that are not only going to put people 
to work; is not only going to give us a 
more sustainable economy; it is going 
to leave more money in people’s wal-
lets. 
The single best thing we can do to 
disadvantaged communities is cut their 
energy bill. That is what we are going 
to do. All we need is the ambition. And 
I am so glad that we are in this mo-
ment and with this President and this 
Congress that is rising to that chal-
lenge. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. CASTEN is right. You know, listing 
off all the job opportunities, the trans-
portation sector, he is right. 
And this is a global competitiveness 
issue. We have got to win this race 
with China and the Europeans. They 
are building those electric vehicles. 
But how exciting was it to see the 
announcement from Ford and GM? 
I can’t wait to see this electrified F– 
150 truck, the Lightning. 
This is an enormous opportunity, es-
pecially in the industrial Midwest that 
has really seen a lot of job loss over the 
years to China. We are going to get 
back on this, and the only way we can 
do it is through making these targeted 
investments. 
We want to build the electric vehi-
cles that the world drives. We want to 
make sure that that charging infra-
structure goes coast to coast in every 
community. 
But it is going to take the focus of 
America. And the good news is, all 
Americans—I don’t care if you are a 
Democrat 
or 
Republican 
or 
Inde-
pendent, or what, they understand that 
clean energy is the future; and that if 
we do it right, we can lift communities 
that need it; and we can create mil-
lions and millions of jobs. 
Now, I started with the science. And 
we heard from some outstanding col-
leagues, and we are going to hear a lot 
more from them in the coming weeks 
as we hammer out the American Jobs 
Plan. 
But there was one witness at one of 
our early hearings, Dr. Abdelhadi, who 
is an expert, who has been focused on 
climate for many years, and I want to 
just remind what he said. 
He said: The limited actions to ad-
dress this climate crisis have resulted 
in lost opportunity and have produced 
a challenge that is even greater than it 
was even a few years ago. With polit-
ical and society will, and with stra-
tegic and scientifically informed action 
that considers all of the dimensions of 
climate change, the dangerous trajec-
tory we are on can be altered, such 
that our generation’s story can be one 
of success and not failure. 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to close, as I often do, by observ-
ing that there are really only three 
things we have to do as a country. 
The first thing we have to do is cut 
the energy—double the efficiency with 
which we convert energy into economic 
activity. If we were to cut our energy 
use per dollar of GDP in half, we would 
almost be at the level that Switzerland 
has already achieved. I think we are

better than Switzerland, personally, 
but let’s at least aspire to be as good as 
Switzerland; double our efficiency. 
The second thing we have to do is do 
the research and development to figure 
out how to decarbonize industries like 
steel- and cement-making because we 
don’t know how to make silicone; we 
don’t know how to make steel; we 
don’t know how to make cement; we 
don’t know how to make fertilizer 
without fossil fuels today. That is an 
R&D challenge we have to figure out. 
Then we have to get to zero CO2 
emissions; not by 2050, not by 2030, by 
1990. We have to get back to 350 parts 
per million in the atmosphere because 
that is the point that we can say to our 
children: We are leaving you a better 
planet than the one we inherited, 
where wildfires are not the norm, 
where droughts are not the norm. 
And is it going to be easy? 
No. But we know how to do it. 
The first thing we ought to do is take 
our hand off the emergency brake. Stop 
subsidizing 
yesterday’s 
technology. 
Embrace markets. Embrace innova-
tion. Embrace all that makes us Amer-
ican. Stop subsidizing the fossil fuel in-
dustry by $650 billion a year. 
Unleash the power of our innovators. 
Unleash 
the 
power 
of 
our 
entre-
preneurs. Unleash the power and the 
innovation of all our great universities 
and national labs who will figure out 
how to do these hard things. 
And then, yes, even after we do all 
that, make significant Federal invest-
ments in the things that the private 
sector is not very good at, like trans-
mission, like coast-to-coast broadband, 
like EV stations. We have done it be-
fore. That is how we built the rail-
roads. It is how we electrified the coun-
try. 
It is not going to be easy, but it will 
be necessary. It will be inspiring, and it 
will be a story that we will tell our 
grandchildren about because we will be 
able to tell them that we were there, in 
this moment; we saw what was nec-
essary, and we made it possible. I think 
that is something worth doing. 
It is our opportunity. It is our mo-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
SELF-INFLICTED CRISES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. JOHNSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, during my time tonight, my 
colleagues and I will address the major 
crises happening here at home, hap-
pening close to home, and now hap-
pening abroad. Our message tonight 
will cover many topics, but the theme 
is consistent. These crises are self-in-
flicted. There are the direct results of 
disastrous policy decisions from the 
Biden administration. 
We have a large number of Members 
who want to participate tonight, so I 
will begin immediately by yielding to 
the gentleman from central Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. JOYCE), my good friend. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, under the leadership of the 
Biden administration, Americans are 
facing escalating challenges to our 
economy, to our national security and, 
ultimately, to our way of life. As we 
have heard many times, our Nation 
continues to jump from crisis to crisis. 
On this floor, I have often raised con-
cerns about the border crisis, and it 
continues to spiral out of control as we 
record an increasing number of mi-
grants crossing the southern border, 
along with gang violence, human traf-
ficking, and deadly illicit drugs. 
Border agents seized over 900 pounds 
of fentanyl at our southern border last 
month alone. Today, we are witnessing 
an escalating crisis and, unlike our 
Vice President, the American people 
aren’t laughing. 
More than 80 days ago, President 
Biden tasked Vice President HARRIS 
with 
addressing 
the 
border 
crisis. 
Months later, she has yet to visit the 
border and witness the devastation 
firsthand. 
b 2045 
How many days will it take? One 
hundred? Two hundred? A year? 
If Vice President HARRIS needs en-
couragement to get to the southwest 
border, then Congress can provide an 
incentive. I am proud to support Con-
gresswoman ASHLEY HINSON’s See the 
Crisis Act, which would defund Vice 
President HARRIS’ international travel 
until she visits America’s southwest 
border. 
It is simple. If the Vice President 
wants to go to Europe, then she must 
go to the border first. 
This is no laughing matter. At home 
in Pennsylvania, the border crisis is a 
matter of life and death. Lives are de-
pending on border security. 
The truth is clear: We can’t afford 
the Biden border crisis. We can’t afford 
the Biden economic crisis. We can’t af-
ford the Biden national security crisis. 
And we can’t afford the Biden energy 
crisis. 
This pattern is rooted in the Biden 
administration’s 
broken 
policies. 
Under President Biden’s watch, we are 
a nation in crisis. 
The American people are paying at-
tention, and they are counting on us to 
stop this alarming trend and restore 
our Nation’s path to recovery. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The 
American people are counting on us, 
and they deserve a President who will 
ensure their safety, security, and free-
dom, both here at home and abroad. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN), 
who represents Florida’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight because our 
country is facing a growing economic 
crisis, a crisis of the Biden administra-
tion’s making. 
With his massive and reckless spend-
ing programs, President Biden has 
mortgaged 
our 
economic 
security. 
Long after this current administration 
has skipped town, future generations of 
hardworking Americans will be stuck 
holding the bill. 
It is human nature to like free stuff, 
I suppose, and as long as Uncle Sam is 
willing to dole out money to everyone 
and everything in sight, it is easy to 
understand why people are happily lin-
ing up for their fair share. 
It is also a universal truth that there 
is no such thing as a free lunch. Un-
checked spending doesn’t just hurt us 
in the future. It is also destructive in 
the near term. 
My Democrat colleagues have tried 
for months to convince the American 
people that it is only the rich who will 
pay for reckless spending policies, but 
people know better. Americans across 
the country are starting to feel the 
pinch of this unbridled spending. 
They are certainly noticing it back 
in my home State of Florida, where 
drivers are paying more for gas than 
they have in nearly a decade. They see 
it when they go to the grocery store, 
where prices on everything from a jar 
of peanut butter to a gallon of milk 
have spiked sharply. They are feeling 
the pain on nearly everything they 
buy, with consumer costs rising at the 
highest rate in nearly 13 years. 
This inflation President Biden has 
created is an immediate tax on work-
ers, causing each hard-earned dollar to 
be worth less than it was before. At the 
same time, skyrocketing costs of mate-
rials are making it even harder for 
small business owners to reopen. 
With high unemployment, record job 
openings, and spiraling inflation, it is 
time for the Biden administration to 
acknowledge that their bad medicine is 
hurting the patient. Congress has the 
authority and the responsibility to rein 
in this reckless spending, and the time 
to act is now. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, my friend is exactly right. 
The people do know better, and the 
pain hardworking Americans are feel-
ing is very real. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER), who 
represents Pennsylvania’s Ninth Con-
gressional District. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, in less 
than 6 months, the Biden administra-
tion’s policies have disrupted the fun-
damentals of our economy and have 
caused significant inflation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2881 
June 16, 2021 
In March, congressional Democrats 
pushed through the $1.9 trillion Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, some thought after 
the recovery began, in a highly par-
tisan process without one Republican 
vote. This level of spending was unwar-
ranted. 
Even 
many 
liberal-minded 
economists estimated it was three 
times bigger than needed and warned of 
inflationary pressures not seen in a 
generation as a result. 
Inflation occurs when too many dol-
lars are chasing too few goods, and pre-
dictability, this influx of spending re-
sulted in prices increasing 4.2 percent 
in April and 5 percent last month. The 
reality is that inflation is a tax, Mr. 
Speaker, on every American family 
who is now paying more for essential 
goods, such as food and gasoline and 
many others, and whose savings are 
now worth less. Again, even liberal- 
minded economists called this the least 
responsible fiscal policy of the last 40 
years. 
At the same time, businesses are 
struggling to compete with Federal un-
employment benefits. In one month, 4 
million Americans walked off their 
jobs. Last month, there were a record 
9.3 million open jobs, a level not seen 
since the beginning of World War II, 
when Americans were leaving to go 
fight the war. Yet, the Biden adminis-
tration denies the correlation between 
open jobs and excessive, untargeted un-
employment benefits. 
Undeterred by the data, the Biden ad-
ministration shows no sign of letting 
up, proposing a $6 trillion budget this 
year that will put our country on a 
path to record debt and that reports 
show will disrupt our long-term eco-
nomic growth. 
The Biden administration is per-
sistent in its charade that inflation is 
not occurring, unemployment benefits 
don’t deter work, and their policies 
won’t significantly disrupt our coun-
try’s strength and economic growth. 
The reality is, the Biden agenda only 
grows government, not the private-sec-
tor economy. 
This can be a great American decade 
if we unleash the power of American 
innovators and entrepreneurs, but we 
can’t do that under the yoke of exces-
sive 
and 
untargeted 
spending, 
in-
creased taxes, and inflation. We must, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
grow opportunity in 
America, which creates the American 
Dream. Government should only serve 
this purpose. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, my friend said it so well. This 
administration either doesn’t under-
stand those fundamentals of the econ-
omy or doesn’t care. It is very per-
plexing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BAIRD), who rep-
resents Indiana’s Fourth Congressional 
District. 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Louisiana for his allow-
ing me to have the opportunity to be 
here and speak on this issue. 
Today, I rise, Mr. Speaker, because 
our country is in crisis. Despite prom-
ises to the contrary, President Biden’s 
policies are crushing small businesses 
and hurting hardworking Americans. 
The simple fact is that we should be 
cruising into an economic recovery 
thanks to the Trump administration’s 
advancements. Instead, we are drown-
ing in Democrats’ reckless spending 
packages that have led to a greater in-
crease in inflation rates than we have 
seen since the 2008 economic crisis. 
As a result, Americans are paying 
more for everything. Gasoline is over 
50 percent more expensive today than 
it was 12 months ago. Transportation 
services are up 11 percent since last 
May. Food and energy prices have seen 
a combined price increase of nearly 4 
percent, a dramatic increase that we 
haven’t seen since 1992. 
The average American simply cannot 
afford this, and it is time that we 
prioritize American paychecks over 
wasteful government spending. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, ‘‘reckless’’ is a word we hear 
over and over tonight and as we talk to 
our constituents because there is no 
better word to describe what is hap-
pening with this administration. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ), the former 
mayor of Miami who represents Flor-
ida’s 26th Congressional District. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, many of 
my 
colleagues 
tonight 
have 
been 
sounding the alarm on the crisis our 
country faces at the hands of the most 
radical, progressive fringes of our poli-
tics. Institutionally, we are facing a 
grave danger right here in Congress, 
with a sitting Member of Congress 
choosing to continue her anti-Semitic 
and anti-American rhetoric from the 
halls of our government. 
When a Member of Congress, who de-
scribes themselves as a starter of fires, 
fuels 
anti-Semitic 
violence 
against 
Jewish communities by perpetuating 
false 
stereotypes 
and 
anti-Semitic 
tropes; denigrates strategic allies of 
the United States and accuses Members 
of 
Congress 
of 
unconstitutionally 
pledging allegiance to a foreign sov-
ereign because of their support of the 
U.S.-Israel partnership; whitewashes 
the September 11 terrorist attacks that 
resulted in the death of over 3,000 inno-
cent Americans; draws equivalence be-
tween the United States and criminal 
organizations such as Hamas and the 
Taliban, both of which have been 
deemed by the Department of State as 
terrorist organizations, it is the abso-
lute responsibility of Speaker PELOSI 
and Democratic leadership to hold 
their Members accountable. 
Unfortunately, Speaker PELOSI has 
lacked the backbone to act and has 
chosen to cower in terror as Members 
of Congress in her party shred America 
apart from this podium. 
They may call themselves a fire 
starter, but I have built my career as a 
firefighter. I cannot and will not allow 
this behavior to go unnoticed and be 
allowed to be swept under the rug. 
These comments and policy stances 
undermine the interests of the United 
States abroad and weaken the effec-
tiveness of our foreign policy, sending 
a dangerous signal to our allies and our 
adversaries 
alike 
that 
the 
United 
States tolerates anti-Semitism, that 
we no longer believe in the long-term 
mission of supporting free peoples and 
free markets, and that we no longer re-
main committed to combating acts of 
terror against the United States and 
our allies. 
While we are encouraged that several 
of my colleagues across the aisle have 
posed their strong rebuke of these anti- 
American 
comments 
and 
policy 
stances, the only rebuke on this issue 
that will have any meaningful impact 
is one by the Speaker and the majority 
of the House of Representatives. 
To turn a blind eye on this would be 
a 
‘‘cowardly 
refusal,’’ 
as 
Speaker 
PELOSI characterizes it, to hold Mem-
bers on your side of the aisle account-
able and dereliction of your role as the 
leader of your party and as the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives, an in-
stitution we all so proudly and honor-
ably serve. 
Anti-Americans have no right to 
threaten our country without retribu-
tion. America deserves better. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, my friend is exactly right. 
That language is dangerous, and our 
colleague that he referenced is contrib-
uting to the foreign policy crises that 
have developed rapidly over the last 
few months. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, there is 
growing evidence that COVID–19 origi-
nated in a lab in Wuhan, China, which 
the liberal media and Big Tech dis-
missed as a conspiracy theory. 
Time and time again, the Chinese 
Communist Party has lied and covered 
up the origins of COVID–19. Repub-
licans have repeatedly called for a full, 
thorough investigation into this virus, 
but these calls have fallen on deaf ears. 
It is unclear why my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have refused 
to hold Communist China accountable. 
They refuse to allocate any resources 
to support a full investigation or even 
hold a hearing. They are allowing 
China to get away with its deadly lies. 
Over 600,000 Americans have died 
from COVID–19. It is time to stop push-
ing the America last agenda that 
prioritizes 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party over giving the American people 
the answers they deserve. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, my friend from Arizona is ex-
actly right. This crisis with China and 
the Chinese Communist Party is per-
haps the greatest threat that we face 
as a people today, and we need the 
White House to stand strong. I am so 
grateful she brought that good word. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), who 
represents Pennsylvania’s 12th Con-
gressional District. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, when I 
was a kid, my brother and I would help

our dad make ends meet by collecting 
aluminum cans on the side of the road. 
We didn’t make much, but what we 
made, we used to buy food. Very early, 
we learned the value of a dollar. 
Today, the value of that same dollar 
has plummeted because of wasteful, 
Big Government spending, like the 
kind President Biden has embraced 
with his disastrous economic policies. 
One of President Biden’s core cam-
paign promises was that he would not 
raise taxes on any Americans making 
less than $400,000 a year. What he failed 
to mention was the hidden tax brought 
on by his inflationary spending. In 
May, the Consumer Price Index jumped 
to 5 percent, the fastest rate since 2008. 
Every American is feeling the strain 
from this administration’s reckless 
spending spree. From the gas pump and 
the supermarket to the clothing store 
and the car dealership, Americans are 
spending more and getting less. 
While the current administration 
shovels trillions of taxpayer dollars 
into the furnace of a runaway train, it 
is clear that Joe Biden is intent on sad-
dling our kids and grandkids with in-
surmountable debt. 
It is time for Joe Biden to stop play-
ing politics with taxpayer money and 
start doing what is right for our coun-
try. Let’s get Americans back to work, 
get the government out of the way, and 
allow taxpayers to keep more of their 
own money. After all, they have earned 
it. 
b 2100 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. KELLER is correct. When 
we were kids, they taught us the value 
of a dollar. That is not what our Demo-
crat colleagues are teaching anymore. 
Now they are subscribing to what we 
call fantasy economics, modern mone-
tary theory and all the rest. Mr. KEL-
LER is exactly right, and I am so grate-
ful that he brought that word tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), rep-
resenting the 36th District. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I have one 
question for President Biden and his 
administration: What will it take? We 
are halfway through 2021 and more 
than 700,000 illegal aliens have already 
been apprehended unlawfully crossing 
our southern border. 
Finally, as this administration be-
grudgingly chokes out the words ‘‘bor-
der crisis,’’ Americans and migrants 
alike are being raped, trafficked, kid-
napped, exploited, and murdered. 
Drug cartels are fully in control of 
the U.S.-Mexico border and in many 
places on both sides of the border, and 
they are not stopping there. They are 
infiltrating every community across 
the country—not just down at our bor-
der States—and they are hell-bent on 
causing us harm. Every State is now a 
border State. 
More deadly drugs, like meth and 
fentanyl, are coming up through the 
southern border than ever before to 
kill over 70,000 Americans every year 
from overdoses. There has been over a 
300 percent increase of fentanyl seized 
at the southern border. Even FBI Di-
rector Christopher Wray said that 
there was no question that cartel ac-
tivity from Mexico is spilling over into 
the United States. And yet the Biden 
administration is silent. Silent. 
Today marks 84 days since Vice 
President KAMALA
HARRIS
was fool-
ishly dubbed the border czar. Last 
week, when asked when she planned to 
actually do her job and visit the bor-
der, she had the audacity to laugh. If 
any American didn’t show up for their 
job for 84 days, they would probably be 
fired. 
Clearly, this administration has all 
but abandoned our border communities 
and all of its American citizens. What 
a slap in the face to the American peo-
ple, the rule of law, his sworn oath of 
office, and to the migrants who put 
their lives at risk to come here because 
Biden told them to and encouraged 
them to. 
So what will it take? How much 
worse does the worst border crisis in 
our history need to get before Presi-
dent Biden begins fulfilling his duty to 
defend and secure the homeland and 
protect us and our sovereignty? How 
many more children need to be thrown 
from 18-foot walls or abandoned to die? 
How many more women and girls and 
young boys need to be sexually as-
saulted, trafficked, or murdered? How 
many more Americans need to die from 
drug overdoses or have a loved one hurt 
by an illegal alien who shouldn’t even 
be here? 
I am speaking for the millions of 
Americans who have empathy for those 
wanting to come here but who want to 
do so in a legal way. I am speaking as 
a descendant of immigrants myself. I 
am speaking as a taxpaying citizen 
who knows that we are trillions of dol-
lars in debt and do not have the money 
to pay for noncitizens who are break-
ing our laws. Lastly, I am speaking as 
an American who loves his country 
enough to die for it. Enough is enough. 
President Biden needs to do his job, 
secure our border, and protect this 
great Nation and the oath that he 
swore to uphold. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, despite the obvious mag-
nitude of that big problem on the bor-
der that we have seen and talk about 
all the time, hammering home that 
theme, there have been zero visits to 
the border by the President or the bor-
der czar, the Vice President. 
In fact, when KAMALA HARRIS was 
asked in an interview this week if she 
planned on visiting the border, she 
laughed about it. But I tell you, those 
Customs and Border Patrol agents will 
tell her that it is no laughing matter. 
I am grateful that Mr. BABIN brought 
that forward tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), my 
good friend, who represents the Sixth 
District. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, the evidence 
of the Chinese Communist Party’s de-
nial, distortion, and concealment of 
the coronavirus pandemic from its crit-
ical beginning to the present day is 
overwhelming. 
In January 2020, if not before, the 
Chinese Communist Party knew it was 
dealing with a fast-spreading disease in 
Wuhan but rejected transparency in 
favor of a propaganda campaign to 
spread disinformation. 
From manipulated statistics and the 
prevention of an investigation by inter-
national experts to ousted journalists 
and whistleblowers who were silenced 
through intimidation and foul play, 
there are countless examples of how 
the CCP lied to the rest of the world 
about the origins of the pandemic. 
Prominent epidemiologists and biolo-
gists have raised concerns about a pos-
sible spillover in the Wuhan lab, and 
CDC director Dr. Walensky said it is 
possible COVID could have leaked from 
a lab. 
It was recently reported that three 
researchers from China’s Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology became ill with symp-
toms consistent with COVID–19 and 
sought hospital care in November of 
2019. On top of that, China has not been 
forthright in sharing information nor 
have they cooperated with the U.S. or 
the global community. 
The 
dishonesty 
of 
China’s 
Com-
munist 
leadership 
regarding 
the 
coronavirus pandemic has led to hun-
dreds of thousands of American deaths, 
millions of sick Americans, and tril-
lions of dollars of economic damage to 
our country. 
In the face of this mounting evi-
dence, I join 211 of my House colleagues 
in urging Speaker PELOSI
to inves-
tigate the origins of COVID–19. But 
House Democrats continue to stone-
wall this effort. 
The Biden administration and House 
Democrats cannot continue to turn a 
blind eye to the CCP’s nefarious behav-
ior. We must penalize and hold the CCP 
legally and financially responsible for 
the human and economic suffering its 
Communist Government has caused. 
Enough is enough. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, that is such an important 
point. The evidence is mounting that 
China is indeed responsible for the 
COVID crisis, and we must hold them 
accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS), who rep-
resents the Third District, and is the 
third Louisianan on the floor now. 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, my ancestral forefather trav-
eled to this country 200 years ago or so. 
He was born a poor Irishman with no 
path toward prosperity that did not 
lead through oppressive government, 
indentured servitude. 
He arrived in the port of New Orleans 
after scrapping together enough money 
to book passage on a sailing vessel that 
had been converted from carrying 
cargo to carrying human beings. He 
survived the journey, although many 
poor Irishmen did not.

He came to this land seeking free-

After my father passed, my mother 
and her sister, my Aunt Gloria, took it 
upon themselves to research the family 
tree. They discovered some of the 
truths that I am sharing with you to-
night. This was way before the Internet 
and computers and iPhones. They 
worked in the actual archives. 
One of the things they discovered was 
a letter written by my ancestral fore-
father describing the conditions on a 
vessel he traveled to America upon. His 
sleeping berth measured 2 by 2 by 5. 2 
by 2 by 5. I think about that as I serve 
within this body. 
I recognize the pain that our ances-
tral forefathers and foremothers en-
dured to carve this country of great-
ness from the wilderness. There has 
never been a moment when American 
patriots claimed that our Nation was 
perfect. We have always known that we 
are imperfect men driven by perfect in-
tent to create a nation where a man 
could breathe free, and indeed we have. 
The sovereignty of America requires 
action from this body and from this ex-
ecutive, 
our 
current 
executive, 
to 
maintain the security and sovereignty 
of our Nation at the southern border. 
The very promise of America is threat-
ened by the policies and weakness of 
action and refusal to act in response to 
1.1 million criminal crossings year to 
date. 
b 2110 
The very freedoms and opportunities 
that our ancestral forefathers and 
foremothers came to this country to 
embrace, the blood and life and limb 
that has been sacrificed by generations 
of patriots past have preserved Amer-
ica. 
America itself is imperiled from 
within. It is the duty and the sworn 
oath of Members of this body to ring 
our voices loud and clear across the 
land that we will not allow America to 
fall into decline. We will not become 
judicious managers of our Nation’s fall. 
We will stand and we will fight; we will 
make noise and we will be heard. 
I thank my colleague for allowing us 
to gather this evening and speak on be-
half of the citizens that we serve, the 
Nation that we love, and the future 
that we will not allow to demise. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Captain HIGGINS for 
those impassioned words. He is exactly 
right. 
One of the things that is so heart-
breaking, frustrating, unconscionable 
about this is we can solve this crisis at 
the border pretty simply. All we need 
the White House to do is reimplement 
the Trump-era policies because that in-
creased border security, it discouraged 
illegal immigration and it reinstituted 
law and order, and we can do that, but 
they won’t. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), who rep-
resents Georgia’s First Congressional 
District. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss 
the many foreign failures President 
Biden and the Democrats have made 
putting 
our 
national 
security 
and 
country at risk. 
When President Biden came into of-
fice, he and Vice President HARRIS in-
vited people to come through our bor-
der. President Biden even stopped con-
struction of the highly successful and 
necessary border wall. 
The Biden border crisis was prevent-
able, and can be fixed if President 
Biden and Vice President HARRIS would 
visit the border like I have. 
President Biden has also been apolo-
getic to our Nation’s greatest foes. He 
refused for months to acknowledge the 
possibility that the coronavirus was 
man-made in the Wuhan lab. He let big 
tech silence those who spoke out about 
the evidence, despite leaked emails 
from Dr. Fauci that showed even he 
knew the lab leak theory was highly 
possible and likely probable. 
And now President Biden wants to 
hand our vaccine technology over to 
China free of charge. Members on both 
sides of the aisle recognize the dangers 
of this. Yet President Biden would 
rather side with the Chinese Com-
munist 
Party 
than 
American 
innovators and American workers. 
And most recently, the Biden admin-
istration and my colleagues across the 
aisle won’t condemn anti-Semitic com-
ments made by Members of this Cham-
ber. 
To conflate the U.S. and Israel with 
Hamas and Iran is disgusting. It is 
wrong. And it is an insult to the men 
and women who fought for our country 
and who still defend our country 
against terrorism. 
It is time for President Biden to put 
America first. President Trump did, 
and our country was stronger than ever 
before. Now it is time for President 
Biden to do his job and stand up for the 
U.S. and hardworking, patriotic Ameri-
cans. 
You work for Americans, not for for-
eign countries. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, that is a great reminder of 
who the President serves, and it is con-
founding to us that he doesn’t under-
stand these basic truths. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT), who 
represents Tennessee’s Second District. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, for yielding. Second Con-
gressional District, but first in our 
hearts. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Always. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, 1 year 
ago, the average cost of gas in America 
was $2.17 a gallon. Today, it is $3.07 per 
gallon, a 41 percent increase. 
But it isn’t just gas prices. Costs for 
many goods and services Americans 
rely on are quickly rising. The Con-
sumer Price Index, which tracks the 
cost of things, like food and energy, 
jumped 5 percent in May compared to 1 
year ago. 
This inflation is the ultimate cost of 
President Biden’s $2 trillion Big Gov-
ernment spending spree back in Janu-
ary, Mr. Speaker. The Federal Govern-
ment is printing money at a breakneck 
pace, decreasing the purchasing power 
of our dollars. 
Meanwhile, businesses can’t get folks 
to come back to work, thanks to Presi-
dent Biden’s generous unemployment 
benefits. And lately in east Tennessee, 
I have heard stories from small busi-
ness owners who can’t find enough 
workers to keep up with their demand. 
They need to tell the folks at 
Wright’s Cafeteria, where my good 
friend David Wright owns his res-
taurant that was his mama’s and dad-
dy’s, they can’t get folks to come back 
to work. He is still too behind in the 
kitchen. He hasn’t been open for 
months. 
Another friend of mine, Mike Chase, 
owns Calhoun’s, which is a world-fa-
mous restaurant chain in the area. 
And, actually, in Gatlinburg, Ten-
nessee, they have had to close down in 
a tourist section of our community 
that is heavily populated during the 
day by well-heeled tourists wanting to 
spend their money, yet he had to close 
down because he can’t get people to 
work. 
Another 
friend 
of 
mine, 
Charlie 
Peroulas, at the Pizza Palace, world-fa-
mous onion rings. Mr. Speaker, I would 
literally crawl across Magnolia Avenue 
on glass to eat their onion rings. They 
are that good. And his pizzas are great 
as well. He has not been able to have 
full shifts and to serve the community 
as he has in the past. 
Stories like these, though, aren’t 
unique to east Tennessee, Mr. Speaker. 
This is happening all over the country. 
Businesses are raising their prices to 
stay alive, and those costs are passed 
along to the American consumers. 
President 
Biden 
promised 
there 
would be no tax increase on working 
Americans, but inflation sure as heck 
isn’t leaving any money in the pockets 
of our middle class, Mr. Speaker. His 
outrageous spending is causing long- 
term economic damage and saddling 
future generations with debt. And if 
President Biden isn’t stopped in this 
venture, future generations will inherit 
a 
worthless 
American 
dollar, 
Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, the gentleman covered a lot, 
and he is right, this crisis we have, the 
jobs and the economy was so prevent-
able. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON), one 
of my heroes in the Congress. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Chairman MIKE JOHN-
SON for his leadership for promoting 
the truth tonight. It has been so re-
freshing to hear our colleagues bring

facts to the American people that they 
need to know. 
And thanks to the leadership of Vice 
President Mike Pence through Oper-
ation Warp Speed to develop the 
Wuhan virus vaccine, America has been 
able to get back to work with jobs 
being available. 
In May of this year, the Centers for 
Disease Control released updated guid-
ance saying that fully vaccinated peo-
ple no longer needed to wear a mask or 
social distance in most cases. America 
should be completely open for business 
to create jobs. 
We saw President Trump created 
jobs. Under his leadership, we had 
record low unemployment for African 
Americans, for Asian Americans, for 
Hispanics. We had record employment. 
The most number of jobs ever for youth 
and women in the United States by 
cutting taxes, not raising the taxes ei-
ther directly or by inflation, as Mr. 
Biden is doing. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion does not agree with science. Even 
with this huge win to the American 
people, the administration and Demo-
crats want to continue to have unem-
ployed Americans be dependent on the 
government by incentivizing them to 
remain 
unemployed 
with 
increased 
benefits that pay more than a small 
business can provide, destroying jobs. 
I 
commend 
Governor 
Henry 
McMaster for ending these increased 
benefits and getting South Carolina 
back to work. Congress should follow 
suit creating jobs. 
I am grateful to be a cosponsor of 
H.R. 3104, the Get Americans Back to 
Work Act, sponsored by Congressman 
DUSTY JOHNSON. This bill will remove 
the supplemental Federal self-destruc-
tive benefits by June 30 of this year. 
I encourage my colleagues to pass 
this legislation. We must not continue 
to indebt future generations with reck-
less spending or create inflation, which 
destroys the retirement savings of our 
senior citizens and equally is crippling 
to small businesses that are the back-
bone of this country. 
Jobs are uplifting, fulfilling, and 
meaningful for a productive life. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Biden 
administration 
Democrats continue to push policies 
that pay people more to stay at home 
than go back to work, so the results 
are not surprising at all. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY), who 
represents Pennsylvania’s 10th Con-
gressional District. 
b 2120 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, Mr. JOHNSON, for this Spe-
cial 
Order, 
talking, 
unfortunately, 
about the things that make us sad to 
see happening in our country. 
Here, before, they were talking about 
the climate crisis. We sure do have a 
climate crisis. We have a climate of un-
bridled spending happening in this 
country without any eye toward the 
consequences. 
Of course, we have a border crisis. We 
have a law-and-order crisis going on. 
We have a leadership crisis in this 
country. We are ceding the leadership 
of the United States of America to 
thugs in Russia, China, and Iran. 
We have a political crisis, where ev-
erything is politicized, where we can’t 
even get together on things we agree 
with because the other side forces you 
to take votes that potentially destroy 
the fabric of our country, our neighbor-
hoods. The things that we agree on, we 
can’t even do that here because there 
has to be a political price to pay for ev-
erything. 
Of course, the financial crisis—infla-
tion is here, and it is here to stay. In 
May, consumer prices spiked 5 percent 
from the previous year. That is the big-
gest spike since August 2008. Remem-
ber that? The beginning of the Great 
Recession? 
We don’t have to be doing this, but I 
think we are going to do it again. Over-
all, prices jumped at a shocking 9.7 per-
cent 
annualized 
rate 
from 
March 
through May. That is 10 percent. Oh, by 
the way, that coincides with the time 
that the Biden fiscal policies started 
coming into play. They are beginning 
to devastate the economy like we knew 
they would. 
In real terms, if you are driving, you 
are paying 40 percent more today than 
you did at the start of the year. 
And it is artificial, right? We closed 
the Keystone pipeline down. We let 
Russia have their pipeline, but we 
closed ours down. Do you think the gas 
isn’t coming? It is still coming. We are 
just paying a lot more for it because 
they have to put it on a truck or a 
train. 
Heaven 
forbid, 
it 
can’t 
go 
through the Keystone pipeline. Oh, we 
can’t have that. 
Guess who pays? Every single one of 
us. But who does it hurt the most? Do 
you remember the days when you were 
growing up and couldn’t afford to fill 
up your gas tank? You put five bucks 
in and prayed you got to the end of the 
week? That is who it is hurting, and it 
is happening again. 
Food prices are up 2.4 percent, and 
the transport cost of food, up 25 per-
cent. Again, who does it hurt the most? 
Meanwhile, the May jobs report 
shows 9.3 million job openings in the 
U.S., nearly a million increase over the 
numbers for April. 
That is the largest increase ever 
since the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
began counting. These are indicators of 
bad things happening. They are also in-
dicators and a manifestation of bad 
policy when we, as the government, 
pay more for people to stay home than 
they make if they would go to work. 
Who can blame them? They are look-
ing out for their economic best inter-
ests. If they can make more staying 
home, well, God bless them. They have 
to because they have to pay the higher 
prices from all this inflation that is 
‘‘not happening.’’ I say that tongue-in- 
cheek because that is what the Presi-
dent has told us, and that is what 
Janet Yellen told us. 
Well, we might have been born at 
night, Mr. JOHNSON, but it wasn’t last 
night. We know it is happening. It is 
obvious to any Economics 101 student. 
The Biden administration and Demo-
crats in Congress have extended these 
benefits through September. So guess 
what? It is just going to keep going. 
Labor is going to cost more, and ev-
erything associated with labor is going 
to cost more. Who is it going to hurt 
the most? The people working the 
hardest at the bottom trying to make 
their way out. 
Families can’t afford it. Do you know 
who else can’t afford it, Mr. JOHNSON? 
My good friend. I have a friend at 
home. He started a business 51 years 
ago. He came home from fighting for 
his country in Vietnam, and he started 
a business from scratch 51 years ago. 
He hired hundreds of people and was 
known around the world for his prod-
uct. 
Well, guess what just happened this 
month? 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, out of business. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, gotta shut 
her down, man. Gotta shut her down. 
The policies affect people’s lives. 
Like I said, the President and Sec-
retary Yellen said that inflation wasn’t 
real just a few months ago. Now they 
are saying it won’t be permanent. If 
you believe what they said a couple of 
months ago, you might as well believe 
that. 
While they are pursuing another $6 
trillion in spending, we can’t go to the 
bank. We are just going to print it. 
Guess what is going to happen? It is 
going to be runaway inflation, and it is 
actually going to threaten the continu-
ation of this very Republic. And that 
spending is in addition to the $2.1 tril-
lion budget deficit for the first 8 
months of this fiscal year, the largest 
on record, which follows $3 trillion last 
year, which was another record. 
We just simply can’t afford these 
reckless policies. We love our country. 
We want to work with the other side. 
This isn’t working. It is not working 
for the American people. It is not 
working for any of us. 
We are at the tipping point in a lot of 
ways in this country. One of them is 
economic, and we can do something 
about it. But we need the President to 
have some fiscal restraint. We need the 
people in this body to have some fiscal 
restraint. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for offering this Special Order tonight. 
We don’t need to kowtow. We don’t 
need to kneel at the altar of the green 
crazy people who want to drive the 
agenda. 
We have a great country, and we 
could save it. We don’t have to let 
China open a coal plant—one every 
week—while we hobble ourselves and 
shut ourselves out of the great re-
sources that we have in this country. 
We don’t have to do it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I am very grateful for those 
comments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2885 
June 16, 2021 
Mr. PERRY is exactly right. He men-
tioned Economics 101. Some of our col-
leagues would do well to go take a re-
fresher course. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), who rep-
resents Georgia’s Ninth District. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the people of Geor-
gia’s Ninth District to bring attention 
to two major issues plaguing our coun-
try as we speak, the economic crisis 
and the Biden border crisis, as both 
will affect our country for years to 
come. 
Inflationary pressures are crippling 
consumer purchasing power at record 
rates, and our national debt is on the 
rise. 
My constituents are eager to course- 
correct our Nation’s fiscal ship so we 
can 
guarantee 
that 
the 
American 
Dream is attainable for future genera-
tions of Americans. Unfortunately, the 
Biden administration shows no signs of 
curtailing its spending habits any time 
soon, as Democrats are keying up a 
plan to shoehorn through Congress, the 
progressive American Jobs and Fami-
lies Plan, which combined total $4 tril-
lion in deficit spending. 
Folks, the debt is already at $28.4 
trillion. The White House has an-
nounced a budget that will leave the 
American people holding a stunning $39 
trillion in debt by 2031. And what is 
truly scary? The interest payments on 
the debt are on track to eclipse our Na-
tion’s defense spending in just 10 years. 
As a military officer, that doesn’t sit 
well with me. 
The looming debt spiral will quite 
literally be the death of the American 
Dream as we know it if we don’t act 
now. It is clear the Biden administra-
tion has no regard for Americans’ 
pocketbooks, nor does it show any re-
morse for the future generations who 
will be left to bear the brunt of Demo-
crat-controlled spending. 
If that wasn’t enough of a crisis, it 
has been 84 days since Vice President 
Harris was tapped as the border czar, 
yet she still has not made a trip to the 
U.S.-Mexico border. I have traveled to 
the border twice and have personally 
witnessed the escalation of the crisis. 
Why has the Vice President not gone? 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity published shocking statistics that 
paint a very clear picture of how the 
Biden administration policies are cre-
ating a devastating crisis on the bor-
der. Last month, encounters at the bor-
der exceeded 180,000. This level of ap-
prehension has not been seen in over 21 
years and is up 675 percent when com-
pared to May of last year. 
Dangerous human traffickers, gang 
members, and other criminals are 
smuggling deadly drugs over the border 
and into our communities at an alarm-
ing rate, refueling the opioid crisis, the 
very crisis former President Trump 
successfully subdued. 
When we look at fentanyl seizures 
alone, Customs and Border Protection 
has already seized almost double the 
amount of fentanyl in the first 8 
months of fiscal year 2021 than it did in 
all 12 months of fiscal year 2020. 
The numbers will only continue to 
rise as more illicit substances come 
across the border through September, 
especially as Biden continues reversing 
Trump’s successful border policies. 
Enough is enough. We must put coun-
try over progressive politics, and I look 
forward to standing with my Repub-
lican colleagues to do so. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for those 
remarks, and I thank him for his serv-
ice. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 13 minutes remaining. 
b 2130 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), who represents 
Texas’ First Congressional District. 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
emails—as this headline says from 
Wendell Husebo—emails show Anthony 
Fauci scrambled at the beginning of 
the pandemic to determine the poten-
tial U.S. role in funding coronavirus re-
search abroad, and that was because he 
provided money to a firm that provided 
money to the Wuhan lab. 
As this points out, after Fauci made 
that comment that we didn’t do that, a 
couple months later, the man respon-
sible for steering U.S. Government 
funding to the Wuhan Institution of Vi-
rology, Peter Daszak, the president of 
EcoHealth Alliance, thanked Dr. Fauci 
on April 18, 2020, for publicly dis-
missing the theory coronavirus may 
have leaked from that lab to which 
they furnished money. 
Here is another story from the same 
person. Anthony Fauci said in released 
emails: Drugstore masks are not really 
effective. 
He told us, Oh, gosh, you know, we 
need to be taking a mask, everybody 
should be wearing a mask, but that was 
only after he had been against it before 
he became for it. 
And this points out and quotes him 
as just being one of the biggest hypo-
crites. And in fact, that he completely 
lied to the American people, because he 
says that ‘‘Masks are really for in-
fected people . . . ’’ He goes on further: 
‘‘The typical mask you buy in the 
drugstore is not really effective . . . ’’ 
and he says, ‘‘I do not recommend that 
you wear a mask, particularly since 
you are going to a very low risk loca-
tion. Your instincts are correct, money 
is best spent on medical counter-
measures such as diagnostics and vac-
cines.’’ 
But as Fauci emails show, the U.S. 
scientists knew COVID looked engi-
neered only days before insisting that 
the virus was natural. And that is an-
other one of the reasons that Rep-
resentative TAYLOR GREENE filed the 
Fire Fauci Act, and I would encourage 
people to get on board. 
But the virologist who told Fauci 
that SARS–CoV–2 potentially looked 
engineered—he eliminated his Twitter 
account. That article is June 7th. 
And then we find out that ‘‘weight- 
adjusted 
hydroxychloroquine 
and 
azithromycin boosted survival of venti-
lated COVID–19 patients by 200 per-
cent,’’ according to a study. We have 
had hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans who have died while Fauci and 
others belittled a hydroxychloroquine 
regimen, and the good that it could do, 
and the good it has done for most of 
those who have taken it. 
So we know that in the 1950s Presi-
dent Eisenhower said: No, we got no U– 
2 flights going over the Soviet Union. 
And they shot one down. He had to go 
on TV and say: I am sorry, I lied. I am 
very sorry, I thought I was doing the 
right thing by the country. 
In the 1960s, President Kennedy, he 
went on television, and said: I am 
sorry. It is my fault, basically, that 
people died in the Bay of Pigs invasion. 
But who is going to come forward 
and say, you know what, this was my 
fault? It is not going to be Fauci. We 
don’t know if it will be President 
Biden, but somebody owes a big apol-
ogy to the American people. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. GOHMERT is exactly right. 
And the scope of that tragedy is some-
thing that is hard to wrap your mind 
around. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY). 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address an issue of great im-
portance to all of our constituents: 
their economic livelihoods. It has only 
been 6 months since President Biden 
took office and already our country is 
moving in the wrong direction. 
Under President Trump we saw un-
paralleled economic growth. Now under 
President Biden, we are faced with 
more and more government spending, 
fewer and fewer people going back to 
work, 
and 
skyrocketing 
inflation, 
which devalues your money. You can 
see here, a picture is worth a thousand 
words. 4.2 less percent value to your 
dollar today after all the spending the 
government has been doing here lately. 
By the end of 2020, the economy was 
resurgent. And since the economy was 
crippled by the initial lock-downs in 
March and April of 2020, there had been 
an improvement in the unemployment 
rate each month, until this spring. 
After 11 months of significant job 
growth, the unemployment rate in-
creased this past April for the first 
time since last year. 
More Americans are getting vac-
cinated every day and COVID–19 re-
strictions are being lifted around the 
country. This should be a time when 
the recovery reaches new heights. 
There were 9.3 million jobs openings in 
April. That is more job openings than 
any other time in the last year. But 
those jobs may not get filled any time 
soon, due to President Biden and many 
of 
my 
Democrat 
colleagues’

friends’ decision here in this Chamber 
to continue an unsustainable level of 
Federal unemployment benefits. Some 
workers can make more money on un-
employment than going back to work. 
Commonsense dictates that if you 
pay people not to work, they will take 
you up on it. Most people will not act 
against their own economic interests 
by working if they can make more 
money staying home. 
The failure of the Biden administra-
tion has forced some Governors to act 
on their own. So far, 25 States have an-
nounced plans to wind down the extra 
$300 a week in Federal unemployment 
benefits. 
Governor Jim Justice in my State of 
West Virginia announced that our 
State will join that group here this 
month, in June. So when Federal lead-
ership fails, Governors must step up 
and make the best decisions for their 
States. 
West Virginia has had a particular 
problem with worker shortages for 
years now. Gil White, who is our State 
Director of the National Federation of 
Independent Businesses, was asked on 
WV 
MetroNews 
about 
the 
worker 
shortage, and he responded, ‘‘That is 
not a myth; it’s a reality. I don’t care 
if it’s large business or small business 
employers. I think there is a common 
theme that finding workers is very 
challenging, to say the least.’’ 
After a tumultuous year with govern-
ment shutdowns and strict capacity 
limits, the last thing small businesses 
need is a worker shortage that leaves 
them unprepared to meet the demands 
of a reopening economy. 
President Biden’s solution to this 
problem, along with every other prob-
lem, seems to be more spending of your 
hard-earned taxpayer dollars. But with 
our budget deficit at an alarming level, 
and you see it here how it is just sky-
rocketing, our budget deficit, more 
spending will bring about more prob-
lems. 
Our debt is currently $28 trillion, and 
our deficits have grown substantially 
larger in the past year due to spending 
increases in response to COVID–19. 
And, yet, President Biden is currently 
pushing for more than $4 trillion in 
new spending. $4 trillion. 
President Biden has proposed to build 
hundreds of thousands of electric vehi-
cle charging stations, retrofit buildings 
across America, to make them greener, 
and a laundry list of other progressive 
priorities. 
Despite his sometimes moderate de-
meanor, President Biden’s platform is 
far left. President Biden made a long 
list of promises to the left wing of his 
party, like when he said he would ‘‘get 
rid of fossil fuels.’’ It should come as 
no surprise that his administration is 
shaping up to be the most liberal in re-
cent memory. 
We should not keep borrowing money 
from China in order to spend money 
that we don’t have here in America. 
There is a simple solution, unwind 
these expensive government programs, 
continue opening up the economy, and 
let people earn a living again. That is 
our country’s path forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple more 
comments I would like to make on a 
separate issue. 
I rise today to address the crisis at 
the southern border. These images here 
show children being dropped over the 
border fence, and show migrants nearly 
drowning trying to cross the river on 
the border. 
Ladies and gentlemen, dumping chil-
dren across a fence like this into the 
wilderness is not an immigration pol-
icy. That is child abuse. That is not 
how we are supposed to do this. It is an 
outrage. If President Trump had done 
that, he would be attacked everywhere. 
The border crisis is a humanitarian 
crisis. Even the President of Guate-
mala, Alejandro Giammattei, blamed 
the Biden administration’s open border 
messaging calling it ‘‘lukewarm’’ and 
‘‘confusing.’’ 
He explained this messaging actually 
increases the number of unaccom-
panied minors that are sent out on the 
journey and are subsequently traf-
ficked by coyotes and cartels. 
Data shows that Customs and Border 
Patrol agents stopped over 180,000 ille-
gal border crossings in the month of 
May alone, the highest in over 20 years. 
Look, we can have our own opinions, 
but we are not entitled to our own 
facts. 
This is a crisis, ladies and gentlemen. 
It is time for America’s border czar, 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS, to do 
her job and address the humanitarian 
crisis at the border to protect to lives 
of these young children. 
b 2140 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, how much time remains on 
the clock? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I will need to summarize, 
then. 
I am delighted to have had so many 
of my colleagues here tonight to help 
us sound the alarms and inform the 
American people what is going on here. 
We have a crisis here at home. We 
have a crisis on the southern border. 
And we have multiple developing crises 
abroad. You heard the broad spectrum 
of all those tonight, Mr. Speaker. 
Whether it is our concern about jobs 
in the economy with the rising infla-
tion, with this humanitarian crisis 
with young children and traffickers 
and drug cartels at the border, or 
whether we are talking about this ad-
ministration’s critical foreign policy 
blunders, you can summarize it all, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Maybe it was summarized best to-
night by the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. PERRY). He said in one 
phrase: We have a leadership crisis. 
We certainly do. But I will tell you, 
Mr. Speaker, all these issues and every-
thing that my colleagues talked about 
tonight can and should be addressed in 
a bipartisan way. All of us on this side 
of the aisle want to do that. We are 
anxious to do that. We should all want 
Americans to get back to work. We 
should all want to end the humani-
tarian crisis at the border. We should 
all want to achieve peace through 
strength on the international stage. 
It is time for President Biden and it 
is time for our Democrat colleagues to 
work with Republicans for the Amer-
ican people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

‘‘GO FOR BROKE’’ STAMP RELEASE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE) for 
half of the time until 10 p.m., which is 
91⁄2 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
with my colleagues for so many to rec-
ognize and honor a stamp just issued 
by the U.S. Postal Service that, with 
stunning simplicity, remembers, recog-
nizes, and honors one of the most re-
markable and inspirational stories in 
the whole of our country’s history. 
It is a story of tragedy, perseverance, 
and triumph that is so quintessentially 
American, that goes so deeply to our 
essence, and that offers the most fun-
damental lessons that we must never 
forget. And that is the point of this 
stamp, that we never forget the story 
of the Japanese-American soldiers of 
World War II and their famous motto, 
which is its own lesson: ‘‘Go for 
broke.’’ 
For many of us, the story is well- 
known and has instructed and inspired 
our own lives. But for a growing num-
ber of our fellow citizens of our coun-
try and world it is not. So permit me 
just a brief retelling. 
As World War II loomed, Americans 
of Japanese ancestry were beginning 
their third generation, or nisei, in sub-
stantial communities, yet they re-
mained largely marginalized because of 
their race. In Hawaii, they constituted 
over one-third of our population, yet 
largely still labored on plantations or 
worked in small businesses. The same 
was true on the West Coast, from 
Washington through Oregon to San 
Diego. 
Some nisei saw war with Japan com-
ing and sought to enlist in our armed 
services, but they were largely denied 
out of race and suspicion, and sought 
to prove themselves through service in 
the Guard or in Hawaii, the Varsity 
Victory Volunteers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2887 
June 16, 2021 
Pearl Harbor changed everything. In-
famously, over 100,000 Japanese were 
interned for their race, an indelible 
stain on our national fabric. After 
years of Japanese Americans pushing 
to be allowed to prove their loyalty by 
enlisting and fighting, the military fi-
nally relented with the 100th Infantry 
Battalion; the 442nd in the military in-
telligence service; and the 1399th Engi-
neer Construction Battalion. 
The rest, as they say, is legend. The 
100th and 442nd fought their way 
through Sicily, through France and 
Italy, and ended up with the highest 
number of decorations for their length 
of service in the history of our mili-
tary. We honored them in 2010 with our 
Congressional Gold Medal. 
But was that enough? 
Would it all be remembered? 
Three Japanese-American women in 
California, who themselves had been 
incarcerated—Fusa 
Takahashi, 
Chiz 
Ohira, and Aiko King—thought not, 
and they fought a 16-year effort to gain 
approval of this beautiful stamp from 
the U.S. Postal Service, impeccably de-
signed by Antonio Alcala. It was issued 
just weeks ago. 
The design is taken from a 1944 photo 
in the field of 442nd Private First Class 
Shiroku ‘‘Whitey’’ Yamamoto, a nisei 
born and raised in the plantation vil-
lage of Ninole on the Hamakua coast of 
my home island of Hawaii. 
It is such a fitting tribute, so appro-
priate. To look into his eyes, Mr. 
Speaker, you see fatigue; you see com-
mitment; but most of all, you see 
gaman, perseverance through great ad-
versity to a better place. 
No better fitting tribute could be 
issued at this point than this stamp. I 
am so honored to stand with my col-
leagues to honor the issuance of this 
stamp in memory of the Japanese- 
American soldiers of World War II. 
I am honored to be joined by my col-
leagues here today who will speak also, 
many of whom labored long and hard 
with the rest of us towards the 
issuance of this stamp. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. TAKANO), who is 
the second vice chair of the Congres-
sional Asian Pacific American Caucus 
and chair of the House Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I say 
mahalo to my colleague, Representa-
tive CASE, for yielding and for orga-
nizing this Special Order hour to com-
memorate the release of an historic 
stamp that honors the bravery and 
service of the 442nd Regimental Com-
bat Team, the Go for Broke Japanese 
American Soldiers of World War II For-
ever Stamp. 
I am a proud Japanese American, the 
son of a mother and father who were 
young children when executive order 
9066 was signed by President Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt, which forced them 
and the rest of my family out of our 
homes and into internment camps on 
American soil. 
Executive order 9066 labeled Japanese 
Americans 
as 
enemy 
aliens. 
It 
scapegoated an entire community of 
Americans and questioned their loy-
alty. It was misguided, it was based on 
lies, and it was rooted in racism and 
fear. 
During this time, 120,000 Japanese 
Americans were unjustly imprisoned, 
mass-blamed for atrocities they did not 
commit. Their rights were trampled, 
their freedoms were curtailed, and 
their humanity was ignored. 
While our own government was car-
rying out the unthinkable against its 
own people, while fighting for the 
ideals of liberty and freedom abroad, 
young Japanese-American men stepped 
up to serve under our flag, even when 
our country did not want them to. 
Following the attack on Pearl Har-
bor, Japanese-American men of draft 
age were excluded from military serv-
ice. 
They 
were 
considered 
enemy 
aliens, unfit to serve and unfit to fight 
for their very own country. Yet, in 
spite of this, a highly motivated group 
of Japanese Americans eager to prove 
their allegiance and patriotism peti-
tioned the U.S. Government for their 
right to serve. 
President Roosevelt relented, allow-
ing these men to form the 442nd Regi-
mental Combat Team of the United 
States Army, a legendary, segregated 
Japanese-American fighting unit that 
was sent to the front lines of World 
War II, even as their families were in 
internment camps back home. 
Among these men were three of my 
great-uncles, including my great-uncle 
Manzo ‘‘Mon’’ Takahasi, who is pic-
tured right beside me. My great-uncle 
Mon gave his life for our country in 
Italy just a few weeks before D-day. He 
was 26 years old. 
Recently, I rewatched the testimony 
of his brother, my other great-uncle 
Nobi, who recounted the story of the 
day that he learned that his brother 
had died in battle, in what he called 
the final push of the war. 
Mon and so many other nisei soldiers 
never had the opportunity to relish the 
victory that they helped secure, but 
their valor helped move our world clos-
er to peace. 
My great-uncle Nobi also shared 
what it was like to serve in the rescue 
of the Lost Battalion as a member of 
the 442nd. The rescue of the Lost Bat-
talion took place in the Vosges Moun-
tains of France in October of 1944. 
Eight hundred men in the 442nd lost 
their lives in combat to rescue 211 men 
in the 141st Texas Regiment. He told a 
story of bloodshed and of the carnage 
that he witnessed there. He described 
the nauseating, terrible feeling after 
seeing dead bodies of American and 
German 
soldiers 
and 
helmets 
all 
around him. 
The nisei fighters believed in the 
promise of America. These men were 
betting on America, and they bet that 
America could be a more perfect, free, 
and more equal Union. In the case of 
my great-uncle Mon, he bet his life. 
I just want to say that the motto of 
this unit was Go for Broke, which 
means to go all in, to bet everything. 
This group of men bet not on the re-
ality of America—the reality then was 
an America that let Japanese Ameri-
cans down, that stripped them of their 
rights and interned them without rea-
son. 
These men were in a humiliating 
place to have to prove their patriotism. 
They had something to prove, and they 
did prove it. So I tell the story of my 
great-uncles and the 442nd with great 
pride and a strong belief that, if it 
wasn’t for them, I would not be a Mem-
ber of Congress today. 
Did they win their bet? 
I stand as evidence that they did. 
b 2150 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. KAHELE). 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Representative CASE, for 
yielding to me so that I may speak on 
the merits of all Japanese Americans 
who served during World War II, a rec-
ognition the United States Postal 
Service 
captured 
with 
the 
recent 
issuance of its 2021 Go for Broke Japa-
nese American soldiers of World War II 
commemorative stamp. 
Go for Broke, the motto of the brave 
442nd Regimental Combat Team, which 
means give it your all, speaks to the 
spirit of courage, of patriotism and sac-
rifice, as well as their fight for equality 
for all people. 
The 442nd, almost entirely composed 
of second-generation Japanese Ameri-
cans, or Nisei, was the most-decorated 
unit for its size and length of service in 
the history of the United States. 
Eighty years ago, these brave Ameri-
cans were filled with dreams, aspira-
tions, and hope, only to be faced with 
harsh discrimination and assaults on 
their character and loyalty to Amer-
ica. 
The Go for Broke Japanese American 
soldiers of World War II stamps are for-
ever stamps and symbolize these men 
and women’s undying devotion to their 
country. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time.

DEBT IS ABOUT TO CRUSH THIS 
COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) until 10 p.m. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
know we are all up against the clock; 
as my wife would say, the tyranny of 
the clock. So I had all sorts of boards 
and information. I was going to drive 
the poor stenographer nuts because 
sometimes I talk a little fast. I will try 
to slow down. I apologize. I have had a 
lot of caffeine. 
But I have a simple thing I want to 
try to walk through. And that is that 
this place isn’t dealing with the actual 
crisis that is about to crush this coun-
try, and it is debt. But it is also oppor-
tunity. It is opportunity for our under-
served populations; those who have

H2888 
June 16, 2021 
been crushed by COVID. And when you 
look at why, I think we have a solu-
tion, but we have to think differently 
in this place. 
So first let’s do the global problem. 
The honest truth about what is about 
to crush us, as a people, is debt. Take 
a look at this chart next to me. Over 
the next 30 years—and this is in ad-
justed dollars, so this is in today’s dol-
lars—$101 trillion of debt in today’s 
dollars. I don’t think we ever get close 
to that, being able to finance that type 
of debt. 
But if you look at the chart, 67 per-
cent of it is just Medicare. The rest 
here is Social Security. The little 
green part of that $101 trillion, only 
about $3 trillion of it is the rest of gov-
ernment. It is Medicare and Social Se-
curity. 
If you believe, like I do, that we have 
a moral obligation to keep our prom-
ises on Social Security and Medicare, 
we need to step up and deal with the 
reality of the math hiding it. 
So think about the debates that have 
been going on here. We are talking 
about $4 trillion here, $4 trillion for 
this. This is the Damocles sword hang-
ing over our head. And the economic 
violence, the evil that we will do to 
seniors and this government when this 
blows up on us is terrifying. 
So I want to walk through some ba-
sics, and as I juggle these boards, a 
really interesting number here, and 
this one is really important. If you can 
take a look at this top line, this is 
what needs to bounce off here. Of that, 
functionally, I think it is $68 trillion of 
debt that is driven just by Medicare 
over the next 30 years, 31 percent of it 
is diabetes. 
If you look at the health outcomes 
from COVID, from my Tribal commu-
nities out in the Southwest, for urban 
populations that have lots of diabetes 
issues, take a look at what a crappy 
year they had, dying from COVID. 
If we don’t change this policy of say-
ing, well, we are going to spend money 
putting up more medical clinics and in 
doing this and doing that, we are going 
to spend money to help people live with 
their misery? 
Is that really what we are about? 
How about doing something bold? 
We are going to do an Operation 
Warp Speed to cure diabetes, and, yes, 
it is going to be hard. 
There is some incredible science com-
ing on type 1 because type 1 is an auto-
immune. Type 2, a lot tougher because 
a lot of it is lifestyle. And we are going 
to have to deal with government policy 
on how we do farm policy, on how we 
do nutrition support. 
But maybe we can come together 
here and say we are going to stop fi-
nancing misery; the diabetes that is 
rampant through our society. Oh, by 
the way, at the same time, it is the sin-
gle biggest impact you can have on the 
debt bomb that is hanging over our so-
ciety. 
And we have got to work through 
some of the crazy policy proposals here 
that 
sound 
great, 
and 
you 
work 
through, and all they are going to do is 
bring more misery to our society. 
How many of you have actually read 
H.R. 3? 
That is the Democrats’ bill on trying 
to deal with prescription drug costs. 
And I understand we need to something 
about prescription drug costs, but what 
it does is it uses reference pricing. 
Which means we are going to go to 
Great Britain here and take what they 
allow for a year—so a single quality 
year of life—and if the drug costs more 
than $37,000, you don’t get it. 
So the new Alzheimer’s drug that was 
finally approved last week, you don’t 
get it because it doesn’t give you—it 
costs more than $37,000. That is the 
price mechanism that makes H.R. 3 
work. That is cruel. 
But on the conservative side, we have 
got to get our math right. We tell peo-
ple, price transparency. Price trans-
parency does a good thing. It makes a 
difference, but it only makes a frac-
tional difference. The best research we 
have been able to find is it is .1 percent 
to .7 percent change in healthcare cost. 
So here is the point I am trying to 
get through. ObamaCare, the ACA, the 
Republican alternative, they were fi-
nancing bills. It is who had to pay, who 
got subsidized. We need to start having 
a debate here on what we pay and how 
we crash the price of healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time do I 
have left? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has under 3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
okay. In that case, I am sorry, I am 
going to talk even faster. 
I am going to make an argument 
that there is a technology disruption 
here that can help us change what we 
pay. The single thing we could do im-
mediately to have the most impact is if 
we could get our brothers and sisters to 
take their hypertension medicines, to 
take their pills. That is 16 percent of 
all healthcare costs. A half a trillion 
dollars a year is just from people mis-
using or not taking their pharma-
ceuticals. 
There is technology now on the pill 
cap, the dispenser, to help grandma, to 
help me, to help all of us take our 
pharmaceuticals when we need it. 
But the other thing, this can be in 
your medicine cabinet. We now have 
the technology that you blow into, 
that tells you if you have a virus; that 
tells you if you have a cancer; tells you 
what you have. 
It is time for the technology disrup-
tion, and it is time this body started to 
legalize that technology to help us dis-
rupt the price of healthcare. We can do 
something. And the beauty of it is, by 
doing the right thing, it affects the 
debt crush that is coming to our soci-
ety. But, also, we start helping our 
brothers and sisters not have to live 
with the misery. 
So an Operation Warp Speed for dia-
betes, Republicans, Democrats, we can 
get on that. There may be some who 
want to do it because of debt. Some 
want to just do it for a humanitarian 
cause. It is the right thing to do. 
And then let’s legalize the tech-
nology that helps us change what we 
pay, instead of having the crazy debate 
we have here of how we pay. 
It is time for the revolution. Adopt 
the technology. Let’s change the price 
of healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who rules the raging of 
the sea, thank You for being our con-
stant source of strength. 
Lord, You know our limitations and 
how our weaknesses can distort the 
clarity with which we should see Your 
providence unfolding. 
Continue to lead our Senators. Direct 
their steps to the destinations of Your 
choosing. Open their ears, O God, so 
that they can hear Your voice calling 
them to attempt great things. 
Though Your path may take them 
through the night, empower them to 
persevere until the morning comes. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Sen-
ators are moving forward this week on 
two major legislative initiatives: infra-
structure and voting rights. 
Bipartisan infrastructure talks con-
tinue in our Senate committees and 
among our Members. 
Remember, discussions about infra-
structure, both physical and human, 
are proceeding along two tracks. The 
first track is bipartisan, and I under-
stand there has been some progress. 
The second track pulls in elements of 
President Biden’s American Jobs and 
Families Plan and will be considered 
by the Senate even if it does not have 
bipartisan support. 
Today, we are going to start moving 
the trains down the second track. I will 
convene a meeting with all the Mem-
bers of the majority party on the Sen-
ate Budget Committee to begin the im-
portant work of producing a budget 
resolution for the Senate to consider. 
This is something we have planned for 
quite a while, but we are moving for-
ward today after having individual dis-
cussions which I have had with many 
members of the Budget Committee. 
It is a diverse committee. Senator 
SANDERS is the Chair. Senators WAR-
NER and KAINE are on it as well. 
There are many items to discuss, but 
one subject is not up to debate. I will 
instruct members to ensure that any 
budget resolution puts the United 
States on track to reduce carbon pollu-
tion at a scale commensurate with the 
climate crisis. We need significant re-
ductions in emissions through clean 
energy and electric vehicles, as well as 
funding to help manufacturers and 
farmers be a part of the solution in 
fighting climate change. 
The American Families Plan, as well, 
is essential to the forthcoming budget 
resolution and must be robustly fund-
ed. 
The Senate will also vote on major 
voting rights legislation before the end 
of June. 
Yesterday, the Democratic caucus 
hosted a group of Democratic law-
makers from Texas who led the dra-
matic walkout to prevent the Texas 
Republican legislators from passing 
one of the most draconian voting laws 
in our country. It was a powerful meet-
ing. We heard moving testimony from 
five different lawmakers about the vi-
cious, nasty, even bigoted attacks 
against voting rights in their State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4558 
June 16, 2021 
The actions taken were totally par-
tisan, just like those in all the other 
legislatures. So the idea that this can 
have some kind of bipartisan solution 
befuddles me, because every action 
taken in the legislature is done just 
with Republican State Senators, Re-
publican assembly members, with no 
Democratic participation or input. In 
fact, the Texas legislators told us they 
were deliberately excluded from cer-
tain meetings and conference com-
mittee hearings. 
Speaking for our caucus, we were all 
taken by the courage of the Texas leg-
islators, their fortitude, and, most im-
portantly, by their mission to defend 
the right of every American to be able 
to access the ballot, not just in Texas 
but across the country. These law-
makers in one State put everything on 
the line to protect voting rights in 
their State. The Senate should put ev-
erything on the line to protect voting 
rights in this country. 
Now, tomorrow, Senate Democrats 
will hold another special caucus meet-
ing to continue discussing the best 
path forward to achieve voting rights 
legislation. 
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE 
Mr. President, 2 days ago, the Biden 
administration became the first admin-
istration since the beginning of the 
Iraq war to support repealing the au-
thorization for the use of military 
force in Iraq, passed in 2002 and now in 
effect for 19 years. 
The Iraq war has been over for nearly 
a decade. An authorization passed in 
2002 is no longer necessary in 2021. It 
has been nearly 10 years since this par-
ticular authorization has been cited as 
a primary justification for military op-
erations. It no longer serves a vital 
purpose in our fight against violent ex-
tremists in the Middle East. 
So I strongly and fully support re-
pealing the 2002 authorization for the 
use of military force in Iraq. This is 
the first time I am formally announc-
ing my support for repeal. 
I want to be clear. In no way will 
America abandon our relationship with 
Iraq and its people as they rebuild 
their country after years of war in our 
shared fight against ISIS, but there are 
very good reasons to repeal the specific 
legal authority. 
For example, it will eliminate the 
danger of a future administration 
reaching back into the legal dustbin to 
use it as a justification for military ad-
venturism. At the beginning of last 
year, we saw that danger become 
frightfully real when President Trump 
ordered an airstrike against an Iranian 
target in Iraq without transparency, 
without proper notification to Con-
gress, and without a clear strategy. 
President Trump cited the 2002 AUMF 
as partial justification, ex-post facto— 
a claim that legal scholars and foreign 
policy experts resoundingly rejected. 
There is no good reason to allow this 
legal authority to persist in case an-
other reckless Commander in Chief 
tries the same trick in the future. 
Tomorrow, the House of Representa-
tives will vote on whether to formally 
repeal the authorization. Next week, 
Chairman MENENDEZ and the Senate 
Foreign 
Relations 
Committee 
will 
mark up a resolution led by Senators 
YOUNG and KAINE which will repeal the 
Iraq war AUMF. It is my intention, as 
majority leader, to bring this matter 
to a floor vote this year, and we will 
discuss the precise timing with Chair-
man MENENDEZ. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, sometimes good news 
comes to those who wait. Other times, 
it comes rather quickly. Earlier this 
year, I recommended to President 
Biden a prominent voting rights attor-
ney for a key position on the Federal 
Bench in New York. 
Yesterday, President Biden agreed 
with my recommendation and an-
nounced his intention to formally 
nominate Myrna Perez for the Second 
Circuit Court of Appeals. I am very 
pleased that the President has chosen 
her and am proud to have championed 
her candidacy. 
Ms. Perez is not only an accom-
plished attorney who has dedicated her 
career to equal justice under the law, 
but she is one of the Nation’s foremost 
experts on voting rights and elections. 
With a national focus on voting rights 
now, it is a significant step to elevate 
Ms. Perez to the Federal Bench. 
Beyond that important exercise, she 
would also be the first Latina to serve 
on the Second Circuit Court since now- 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor—who, inci-
dentally, I suggested to President 
Obama that he put her on the Supreme 
Court. Ms. Perez is a perfect example of 
Democrats’ desire to bring balance, ex-
perience, and professional and personal 
diversity back to the judiciary. 
So far this year, I have made two rec-
ommendations to the Second Circuit in 
New York: Ms. Eunice Lee, a former 
Federal defender, and now Ms. Perez, a 
voting rights attorney. 
The cupboards of the Federal judici-
ary have long been stocked with former 
prosecutors and corporate lawyers. It 
is about time that civil rights attor-
neys, voting rights attorneys, and Fed-
eral defenders like these two out-
standing nominees join the ranks. 
So, 
again, 
I 
applaud 
President 
Biden’s decision. It is a very bright day 
for the future of the Federal Bench in 
New York. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Key economic in-
dicators continue to show that our Na-
tion’s recovery is still facing signifi-
cant head winds. 
Last week, we learned that inflation 
has logged its steepest increase since 
the 2008 financial crisis. There are 
more unfilled jobs in America than at 
any point on record, and, when asked, 
more than 90 percent of the small busi-
ness owners trying to fill them say 
they are having trouble finding quali-
fied candidates. 
So how did we get here? 
When COVID–19 arrived last spring, 
emergency shutdowns put the brakes 
on what had become a roaring econ-
omy. The pro-growth agenda enacted 
by Republicans had helped drive unem-
ployment to its lowest level in a half- 
century. Take-home pay was rising and 
rising fastest for lower earners, and 
millions of new workers were coming 
off the sidelines to join a competitive 
market for American talent. 
The past year presented harsh new 
challenges, but thanks to the bravery 
of frontline workers, the genius of sci-
entists, and targeted, bipartisan relief 
measures passed here in Congress, our 
Nation was beginning to turn the cor-
ner. 
The Biden administration actually 
inherited the conditions for success. It 
had a bipartisan roadmap of how best 
to support our economic recovery. 
Alas, but instead, the Democrats 
chose to ram through trillions of dol-
lars in liberal pet projects—a relative 
pittance for actual pandemic relief and 
a massive expansion of Federal unem-
ployment benefits that has made stay-
ing home the most sensible financial 
decision for literally millions of Amer-
ican workers. 
As one pair of economists put it re-
cently, ‘‘The stimulus bill stimulated 
unemployment, not employment.’’ To 
be specific, their analysis found it cre-
ated conditions in at least 19 States 
where a family of four could claim the 
equivalent of a six-figure salary by 
staying out of the workforce. 
Let me say that again. One recent 
study found that in 19 States, a family 
of four, with two working parents, 
would have had to earn at an annual 
rate of more than $100,000 from work-
ing for it to make financial sense not 
to stay home. In 19 States, it made 
more sense to stay home than to go 
back to work. 
But burying American workers in in-
centives to stay home hasn’t just hurt 
rehiring; it has also magnified supply 
shortages. A few months back, the re-
covery made possible by bipartisan ac-
tion last year had our economy geared 
up for a rush of consumer spending, but 
today, short-staffed producers are hav-
ing to pass the rising costs on to house-
holds just as this rush was set to ramp 
up. 
A tough year forced American fami-
lies to put off some big purchases, but 
now they are facing some of the worst 
sticker shock in a generation. Used car

June 16, 2021 
prices are 30 percent higher than last 
year, and the cost of some home appli-
ances has spiked nearly as much. Ev-
eryday essentials are getting pricier 
too. Milk is up 7 percent, and gas has 
jumped by more that 50 percent. 
Consumers are feeling the real cost of 
what the White House Chief of Staff 
called ‘‘the most progressive domestic 
legislation in a generation.’’ But it 
didn’t have to be this way. These are 
exactly the conditions economists have 
been writing about and warning about 
for months. 
Back in March, the Washington Post 
ran an ominous line: 
For policy experts and even members of 
Biden’s own party, the improving picture is 
raising questions about whether the stim-
ulus bill is mismatched— 
Mismatched— 
to the needs of the current moment. 
Sure enough, not just any member of 
the President’s party but a top econo-
mist under both the last two Demo-
cratic administrations, Larry Sum-
mers, cautioned even earlier that a 
massive spending plan like the one 
Democrats were proposing could ‘‘set 
off inflationary pressures of a kind we 
have not seen in a generation.’’ Pre-
scient, to say the least. That is exactly 
what has happened. 
These exact fears have been realized, 
and experts are still clear about the 
source of the problem. ‘‘Labor short-
ages are the last thing that we need’’ 
with inflation on the rise. Until very 
recently, the White House has been un-
willing to connect these dots. 
States have been on their own to 
turn off the perverse incentives driving 
the shortages. To date, 25 States have 
done so, announcing suspensions of ex-
cessive Federal unemployment supple-
ments. But across the country, Main 
Street has already been feeling the 
pinch. 
In my State of Kentucky, the con-
sequences of Democrats’ misguided 
spending are growing more serious. 
Small business owners in particular are 
nearing a breaking point. One res-
taurant owner in Clark County wrote 
to me to say that ‘‘each week it gets 
harder to create a full schedule. Res-
taurants are already reducing hours of 
operation. Next will come closing.’’ 
I have heard the same story from 
constituents all over the Common-
wealth. 
A 
sign 
manufacturer 
in 
Woodford County had to ask his staff 
to work as many as 10 hours of over-
time each week just to keep up with 
demand. An outdoor supplies maker in 
McCracken County saw shipping costs 
quadruple in the past year. He can’t 
find a prospective employee who will 
even show up for an interview. He can’t 
even find a prospective employee who 
will show up for an interview. After 25 
years of production, he is facing the 
prospect that his company may not be 
able to stay afloat. 
The Commonwealth still has 90,000 
fewer workers than we did before the 
pandemic. In the past year, the Con-
sumer Price Index in Kentucky and 
surrounding States has increased by a 
whopping 7 percent. The recovery teed 
up by smart, targeted, bipartisan poli-
cies last year has been buried under an 
ill-advised, self-inflicted avalanche— 
avalanche—of spending. Folks in Ken-
tucky know all too well what happens 
when Democrats get carried away here 
in Washington. They know who ends up 
footing the bill back home. 
Higher prices at the gas pump and 
the grocery store, just as families were 
hoping to put a year of sacrifices in the 
rearview mirror—these are the real- 
world effects of the Biden administra-
tion’s multitrillion-dollar economic de-
bacle. These are the effects that Repub-
licans and nonpartisan experts have 
warned about literally for months. 
The American people are, neverthe-
less, 
resilient. 
Job 
creators, 
innovators, and skilled workers are 
ready. But as our economy slowly gets 
back up to speed, it certainly won’t be 
because Democrats stroked an outsized 
check; it will be in spite of it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today 
President Biden had the first of his 
meetings 
with 
Russian 
President 
Vladimir Putin. He certainly has many 
important messages to convey to Mr. 
Putin about ongoing cyber attacks 
against us and our allies, the mur-
dering of peaceful political opponents, 
and potential areas where we may be 
able to work together to deal with nu-
clear proliferation. The important dis-
cussion comes after several days where 
President Biden reaffirmed our rela-
tionship with our most important al-
lies, those in the G7 and NATO. There 
were important announcements about 
leading the global COVID vaccine ef-
fort and standing up to the outrages 
perpetrated by nations around the 
world. But perhaps what was most im-
portant was that President Biden re-
asserted America’s role as a leading 
champion of democracy, security, and 
international norms. 
I hope this spells an end—and I be-
lieve it does—of the unimaginable 
events that occurred in the previous 
administration: Coddling a foreign dic-
tator such as Putin, dismissing our 
closest allies, and threatening the crit-
ical North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion. 
President Biden knows that Amer-
ica’s leadership and its example are 
critical in leading shared efforts to 
stop this pandemic, tackle climate 
change, push back on rogue nations, 
and maintain global norms of behavior. 
President Biden also knows that how 
we manage our democracy here at 
home affects our ability to lead abroad. 
The last administration bullied our 
allies, who watched in disbelief as it 
cozied up to the autocrats around the 
world. I have often said that a great 
deal of America’s influence around the 
world comes from the power of its 
ideals and values—critical and precious 
assets that we must nurture and never 
take for granted. 
Our historic peaceful transfer of 
power has been a marvel for genera-
tions for much of the world. I will 
never forget the power and emotion 
felt walking with my friend the late 
Senator 
John 
McCain 
through 
Ukraine’s Maidan square, looking at 
the makeshift memorials to those who 
lost their lives hoping for a free and 
democratic Ukraine. 
John McCain once said: 
America’s greatest strength has always 
been its hopeful vision of human progress. 
I couldn’t agree more. I couldn’t be 
more proud that President Biden is re-
affirming this belief on the world stage 
this week. So let me take this moment 
to commend the President and his 
team for a timely, critical, and impor-
tant visit with international allies and 
adversaries in recent days. It won’t 
solve all the problems we face, but we 
can be proud of this example of Amer-
ican leadership, generosity, and de-
cency. 
JUNETEENTH 
Mr. 
President, 
this 
Saturday 
is 
Juneteenth, the oldest nationally cele-
brated commemoration of the end of 
slavery in America. Our Founders were 
brilliant and brave about many, many 
things, but they lacked the wisdom, 
perhaps the courage, maybe even the 
resolve, to face a poisonous contradic-
tion at the heart of our new Nation. 
How could this Nation, founded on the 
belief that all people are created equal, 
condone and allow human slavery? 
Many of our Founding Fathers owned 
slaves themselves. 
Eighty-five years after our founding, 
that unresolved contradiction plunged 
America 
into 
civil 
war. 
Halfway 
through that war, President Lincoln 
issued the Emancipation Proclama-
tion, declaring that all persons held in 
bondage in rebellious States ‘‘are, and 
henceforth shall be free.’’ 
His action meant little to most 
enslaved people in America. Most of 
those held in bondage didn’t gain free-
dom for another 2 years after the Civil 
War 
ended. 
For 
the 
250,000 
men, 
women, and children enslaved in the 
State of Texas, the wait was even 
longer. They learned of their freedom 
on June 19, 1865, 2 months after the 
Civil War ended, when Army MG Gor-
don Granger and 2,000 Union troops 
marched into Galveston, TX, with or-
ders to enforce the Emancipation Proc-
lamation. 
One year later, African Americans in 
Galveston 
held 
America’s 
first 
Juneteenth celebration to commemo-
rate that moment when they knew of 
the end of slavery in America. For-
merly enslaved people wore their finest 
clothes, read the Emancipation Procla-
mation, and prayed together.

June 16, 2021 
Later, as African Americans in Gal-
veston and other parts of the South 
joined the great migration north, they 
carried that Juneteenth memory with 
them, giving the celebration new roots 
in Chicago, Los Angeles, and scores of 
other cities. 
Today, Juneteenth is celebrated as a 
State holiday or day of observance in 
47 States, including my State of Illi-
nois and in the District of Columbia. 
Yesterday, 
this 
Senate 
approved 
unanimously the resolution honoring 
Juneteenth as a national day of reflec-
tion and celebration. In this moment in 
time in our divided Nation, that unani-
mous recognition of the importance of 
Juneteenth is a balm to our national 
soul. 
FILIBUSTER 
As America prepares to celebrate 
Juneteenth 2021, we must also remem-
ber 
that 
the 
‘‘absolute 
equality,’’ 
promised at that first Juneteenth in 
1865, has too often been denied to Afri-
can Americans. 
Just a year after the Civil War ended, 
Southern States enacted the ‘‘Black 
Codes,’’ State laws meant to preserve 
White supremacy. In response, Con-
gress passed the Civil Rights Act of 
1866 and the 14th and 15th Amendments 
to the Constitution, guaranteeing Afri-
can Americans due process of law and 
Black men the right to vote. 
Unbowed, Southern States invented 
Jim Crow laws, creating new hurdles to 
voting and participation that made it 
nearly impossible for many African 
Americans to exercise their voting 
rights and other basic rights of citizen-
ship. 
As the great activist W.E.B. DuBois 
wrote in his essay ‘‘Black Reconstruc-
tion in America,’’ ‘‘The slave went free; 
stood a brief moment in the sun and 
moved back down again toward slav-
ery.’’ 
This betrayal of the promise of free-
dom for African Americans was pos-
sible, in part, because of misguided 
Court decisions by the Supreme Court, 
especially the infamous 1896 Plessy v. 
Ferguson ruling, which enshrined the 
concept of ‘‘separate but equal.’’ That 
odious decision stood for more than 50 
years as the law of the land, making 
racial discrimination both legal and 
enforceable. 
The betrayal of equality for African 
Americans also was abetted by south-
ern segregationist Senators who wield-
ed the filibuster as a weapon for dec-
ades to stop civil rights measures in 
Congress. 
I know our Senate minority leader 
and some of his colleagues on the other 
side get upset when anyone utters the 
words ‘‘filibuster’’ and ‘‘Jim Crow’’ too 
close together. They insist that the fil-
ibuster has nothing to do with race. 
Well, history, in fact, proves otherwise. 
Historian Sarah Binder is a leading 
expert on the filibuster. According to 
her analysis, of the 30 measures be-
tween 1917 and 1994 that were killed on 
this Senate floor by the filibuster, ‘‘ex-
actly half addressed [the issue of] civil 
rights . . . including measures to au-
thorize Federal investigation and pros-
ecution of lynching, [banning] the im-
position of poll taxes, and [prohibiting] 
discrimination on the basis of race and 
housing.’’ That total doesn’t count 
other major civil rights measures, such 
as the Civil Rights Acts of 1967 and 
1964, which passed only after lengthy 
filibusters by segregationist Senators. 
Today, Senator MCCONNELL is vowing 
to use the filibuster, if necessary, to 
protect a flood of new State voting 
laws that are as racially discrimina-
tory as we have seen since the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 officially barred Jim 
Crow from American elections. After 
record numbers of Americans braved a 
deadly pandemic to vote in the 2020 
elections, Republican-controlled State 
legislatures are rushing to pass new 
laws to make it harder—not easier, 
harder—for millions of Americans to 
vote, especially people of color. 
Supporters of these new voter sup-
pression laws cite the Big Lie as their 
justification, 
Donald 
Trump’s 
dan-
gerous, discredited claim that the 2020 
Presidential election was somehow sto-
len from him. That Big Lie has been re-
jected by State election officials of 
both parties, by our Nation’s top elec-
tion security experts, and by every 
Federal judge it has faced, including 
several appointed by President Trump 
himself. Sixty times President Trump 
went to Federal courts with his Big 
Lie, and 60 times he lost. 
Despite all of that, Senator MCCON-
NELL and many of our Republican col-
leagues have vowed to filibuster our 
measure, known as the For the People 
Act, which includes provisions to pro-
tect voting rights, defend the integrity 
of elections, prevent billionaires from 
buying elections, and strengthening 
ethics. 
Their opposition to protecting the 
right to vote doesn’t end there. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL has also said he will 
oppose the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, a bill that Senator 
LEAHY and I are working on in the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, that would 
restore and strengthen the protections 
of the Voting Rights Act. 
I will say this. In all fairness to the 
minority leader, his use of the fili-
buster is not limited to matters of civil 
rights 
and 
racial 
justice. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL has transformed the fili-
buster from a rarely used tactic to a 
weapon of frequent mass obstruction. 
When Barack Obama was elected 
President in 2008, our Nation was tee-
tering on the edge of a second Great 
Depression, and Senator MCCONNELL 
said his top priority was to make 
President Obama ‘‘a one-term Presi-
dent.’’ Not to rescue the economy—no, 
that wasn’t his top priority. Not to 
help people who had lost their homes 
or business. Senator MCCONNELL’s No. 1 
priority was to make President Obama 
a one-term President. He would do that 
by dramatically increasing the use of 
filibusters in order to deny the new 
President every possible achievement. 
Fast-forward to this year. President 
Biden is sworn in during an epidemic 
that has killed hundreds of thousands 
of Americans and sent our economy 
into 
deep 
recession, 
and 
Senator 
MCCONNELL was quoted again saying: 
‘‘100 percent of our focus is on stopping 
this new Administration.’’ Not stop-
ping the virus nor the economic devas-
tation we are facing, but stopping the 
new administration. Again, the weapon 
of choice for Senator MCCONNELL is the 
filibuster. 
Three weeks ago, 42 Republican Sen-
ators stood with Senator MCCONNELL 
and filibustered a bill to create an 
independent, bipartisan commission to 
investigate the deadly January 6 at-
tack on the U.S. Capitol. This inde-
pendent Commission’s mission would 
have been to examine the attack on the 
Capitol and the events leading up to it. 
Fifty-six Senators, a clear majority, 
supported creation of the January 6 
Commission. It wasn’t enough. We 
needed 60 votes. Senator MCCONNELL’s 
filibuster prevailed again. 
For those who argue that the fili-
buster encourages bipartisan coopera-
tion, let me tell you: The January 6 
Commission bill was the result of in-
tense bipartisan compromise. Negotia-
tions were worked out by top Repub-
licans and Democrats in the House, and 
it was filibustered by Senator MCCON-
NELL regardless. 
The Commission would have been 
more comprehensive and less political 
than the inquiries into the insurrection 
being conducted by congressional com-
mittees. Like the 9/11 Commission, the 
January 6 Commission would have sub-
poena authority to get to the truth. 
For a short while, Senator MCCON-
NELL said he would keep an open mind 
about whether to support the bill. The 
night before the House voted to create 
the 
Commission, 
however, 
former 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
posted 
a 
screed on his blog denouncing the Com-
mission as a ‘‘Democratic Trap.’’ That 
was all Senator MCCONNELL needed to 
hear. The former President demanded 
that Republicans reject the Commis-
sion and added: ‘‘MITCH
MCCONNELL 
and KEVIN MCCARTHY, I hope you’re lis-
tening.’’ Well, it turns out that they 
were. 
The next day—after 35 House Repub-
licans joined Democrats to create this 
January 
6 
Commission—Senator 
MCCONNELL
announced that he was 
going to filibuster it and oppose it. He 
asked members of his caucus, as a per-
sonal favor, to support his filibuster of 
the January 6 Commission. 
This is where the abuse of the fili-
buster has brought us. We aren’t able 
to break through the partisan gridlock 
even to investigate the worst attack on 
the Capitol of the United States of 
America in more than 200 years. How 
can anyone believe, after that shameful 
vote, that protecting the filibuster as 
it is currently misused is protecting 
our democracy? Cynical, overuse of the 
filibuster 
imperils 
our 
democracy. 
There has got to be a better way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4561 
June 16, 2021 
Contrary to Senate myth, the fili-
buster is not in our Constitution—just 
the opposite. The man who wrote that 
Constitution knew well how requiring 
supermajorities for routine bills had 
doomed the Articles of Confederation. 
They deliberately rejected a super-
majority requirement for common leg-
islation when they wrote the Constitu-
tion. 
Defenders say the filibuster encour-
ages 
bipartisan 
compromise. 
Look 
around you. Does anyone really believe 
for a minute that this is the new gold-
en age of bipartisan compromise in the 
Senate? 
There are proposals to mend the fili-
buster. We could bring back a talking 
filibuster. We all remember the movie 
‘‘Mr. SMITH
Goes to Washington,’’ 
where he withered and fell to the floor 
at his desk carrying on an endless fili-
buster. It isn’t that way any longer. 
Senators now can start a filibuster 
with a phone call and head home for 
the weekend. That is not what the fili-
buster was designed for. If a Senator 
feels strongly enough about an issue to 
grind the Senate to a halt, they should 
be willing to stand up and speak their 
mind and stay on the Senate floor. 
Some have proposed changing the 
number of votes needed to end debate, 
possibly lowering the 60-vote require-
ment for cloture to 55. That is a prece-
dent that at least is consistent with 
historical trends, but leaders of both 
parties need to agree on it. 
I am willing to consider any reason-
able plan that promotes genuine bipar-
tisan cooperation and ends the tyranny 
of the minority. What we cannot do is 
nothing. 
After a minority of Senators used the 
filibuster to prevent—for now—the cre-
ation of the January 6 Commission, we 
all went home for a long Memorial Day 
weekend. On my flight home and all 
that weekend, I thought of the young 
men who stormed the beaches of Nor-
mandy on D-day, running straight into 
enemy fire, knowing well that they 
might die to preserve democracy. And 
many of them did. Now we see Mem-
bers of the Senate routinely abusing 
the filibuster because they are afraid 
to face an unpleasant vote or an angry 
insult from Donald Trump. Surely, we 
are better and braver than this. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

June 16, 2021 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Lydia Kay 
Griggsby, of Maryland, to be United 
States District Judge for the District 
of Maryland. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, the cloture vote 
with respect to the nomination of 
Tommy P. Beaudreau, to be Deputy 
Secretary of the Interior, occur fol-
lowing the disposition of the Griggsby 
nomination. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, for the 
information of all Senators, this means 
that there will be three rollcall votes 
beginning at 3:15 p.m. this afternoon. 
NOMINATION OF LYDIA KAY GRIGGSBY 
Mr. President, today I rise to speak 
on the nomination of U.S. Court of 
Federal Claims Judge Lydia Griggsby 
to be U.S. district judge for the Dis-
trict of Maryland. We just invoked clo-
ture, and we will be voting on that 
nomination this afternoon. 
Judge Griggsby was favorably re-
ported by a bipartisan vote of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary on June 10. I 
had 
recommended 
Judge 
Griggsby, 
along with Senator VAN HOLLEN, to 
President Biden, and I strongly support 
this nomination. 
Judge Griggsby has been nominated 
to fill the current vacancy created 
when Judge Catherine Blake, appointed 
by President Clinton in 1995, an-
nounced her intention to take senior 
status on April 2. President Biden nom-
inated Judge Griggsby to this position 
on March 30, and the Judiciary Com-
mittee held her confirmation hearing 
on May 12. 
Shortly after the November 2020 elec-
tions, I worked with Senator VAN HOL-
LEN to establish a judicial selection 
committee in Maryland. We used an 
open application process with a public 
advertisement and communicated and 
worked closely with the State, local, 
and specialty bar associations in Mary-
land. 
In particular, we sought out a highly 
qualified and diverse application pool. 
Our committee interviewed everyone 
who submitted an application, which 
involved several dozen interviews. Sen-
ator VAN HOLLEN and I then personally 
interviewed several finalists before rec-
ommending names to the White House. 
The White House Counsel asked Sen-
ators to propose talented individuals 
who would bring to these critically im-
portant roles a wide range of life and 
professional 
experiences, 
including 
those based on their race, ethnicity, 
national origin, gender, sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, religion, veteran 
status, and disability. 
I would call my colleagues’ attention 
to a recent Washington Post article en-
titled ‘‘President Biden Has Nominated 
as Many Minority Women to Be Judges 
in Four Months as Trump Had Con-
firmed in Four Years.’’ Having judges 
with a broad range of backgrounds, ex-
periences, and perspectives makes our 
Federal bench more diverse and better 
representative of the communities they 
serve, which builds greater public trust 
in the judiciary. 
Instead of giving a formal introduc-
tion 
to 
my 
colleagues 
of 
Judge 
Griggsby today, we should really say 
‘‘welcome home’’ to Judge Griggsby. 
When I first was elected to the Senate, 
I served on the Judiciary Committee, 
and my staff and I were pleased to 
work 
with 
then-Chief 
Counsel 
Griggsby. 
She was born in Baltimore and went 
to high school in Baltimore. 
At that time, Judge Griggsby served, 
when she was here, with Chairman 
PATRICK LEAHY’s Judiciary Committee 
staff as his expert on privacy and infor-
mation policy. 
Judge Griggsby went on to serve for 
7 years as a judge on the U.S. Court of 
Federal Claims, which has national ju-
risdiction to hear complex monetary 
damages claims against the Federal 
Government. Judge Griggsby was con-
firmed to her current position by a 
voice vote of the Senate in 2014. 
Judge Griggsby is a lifelong Mary-
lander who was born in Baltimore, a 
graduate of the Park School, and she 
has been a mentor at the Baltimore 
Leadership School for Young Women. 
She received her B.A. from the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania and her J.D. from 
Georgetown Law School. She was an 
associate at DLA Piper before begin-
ning her government service as a trial 
attorney in the Civil Division at the 
U.S. Department of Justice. 
She then became an assistant U.S. 
attorney in the District of Columbia. 
Judge Griggsby later transitioned to 
Capitol Hill, serving as a counsel on 
the Senate Select Committee on Ethics 
before beginning her work with Sen-
ator LEAHY
on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. I am so pleased that Judge 
Griggsby brings such a wide array of 
professional experience from the first 
two branches of government as she pre-
pares to assume a new role in our third 
branch of government. 
In particular, I would note that as an 
assistant U.S. attorney, she helped se-
cure a $20 million settlement against 
Toyota for selling vehicles that vio-
lated the Clean Air Act. She also held 
two of Washington, DC’s largest prop-
erty managers accountable for failing 
to disclose lead-based paint hazards in 
the buildings. 
If confirmed by the Senate, I would 
note that Judge Griggsby would be the 
first Black woman and first woman of 
color to serve as a Federal judge on our 
bench in Maryland in our State’s his-
tory, and it is about time. The Amer-
ican Bar Association’s Standing Com-
mittee on the Federal Judiciary gave 
Judge Griggsby its highest rating— 
unanimously 
‘‘well 
qualified’’—after 
evaluating her integrity, professional 
experience, and judicial temperament. 
I was delighted to recommend the 
nomination of Judge Griggsby to Presi-
dent Biden, along with Senator VAN 
HOLLEN. 
Judicial nominees must meet the 
highest standards of integrity, com-
petency, 
and 
temperament. 
Judge 
Griggsby will safeguard the rights of 
all, uphold the Constitution and rule of 
law, and faithfully follow the judicial 
oath to do equal right to the poor and 
to the rich. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote to 
confirm Judge Griggsby, who I believe 
will be an outstanding member of the 
Federal bench. She is already a sitting 
Federal judge on the U.S. Court of Fed-
eral Claims, and I look forward to her 
continued public service, serving all 
the people of our Nation as a Federal 
district judge. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
JUNETEENTH 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague from Maryland. I rise 
today in gratitude because last night 
the Senate put us one step forward to 
finally making Juneteenth a Federal 
holiday. 
Juneteenth is our Nation’s oldest 
celebration of emancipation, and it 
should have been established as a Fed-
eral holiday long ago. So I am glad 
that yesterday the Senate passed our 
bill, with Senator MARKEY and Senator 
BOOKER, the Juneteenth National Inde-
pendence Day Act, by unanimous con-
sent. 
The end of slavery in this country is 
a central milestone in our history, and 
Juneteenth should be commemorated 
nationwide as a day of celebration and 
reflection and rededication to the 
cause of racial justice in this country. 
I am forever grateful to the genera-
tions of activists who made this pos-
sible, and, in particular, I want to 
thank Ms. Opal Lee, who at 89 years 
old walked halfway across this country 
to rise in support of Juneteenth as a 
Federal holiday. 
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to 
call Ms. Lee, now in her nineties, after 
this bill cleared the Senate, and I wish 
you could have heard the sound of joy 
in her voice when I told her the good 
news. This is a memory that I know I 
am going to treasure for the rest of my 
life. 
So to Ms. Lee, if you are listening 
here today, I want to tell you that I 
have been honored to support your 
moral cause here in the Senate, and I 
hope to celebrate Juneteenth as an of-
ficial Federal holiday with you soon. 
I also want to thank my colleagues, 
especially Senator MARKEY and Sen-
ators BOOKER and WARNOCK, for their

leadership on these efforts, as well as 
Senator CORNYN
and Representative 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE, for their work to 
get this over the finish line. When it 
passed last night, we had over 60 bipar-
tisan cosponsors, and I am grateful to 
all of them and all of you for your sup-
port. 
So commemorating Juneteenth as a 
Federal holiday is an encouraging and 
meaningful step, but we have so much 
farther to go on the path toward jus-
tice. Let’s use this victory to build mo-
mentum for the systemic change that 
we need—protecting voting rights and 
safeguarding our democracy, passing 
meaningful policing and criminal jus-
tice reform, pursuing economic and en-
vironmental justice, and working to-
ward a more just and equitable world. 
There will be plenty of times when 
this path seems impossibly long be-
cause the scale of the injustice is over-
whelming. But when this happens, I 
will be thinking of Ms. Opal Lee, of her 
long walk to Washington, DC, and the 
joy in her voice when she heard the 
news that the Senate had taken one 
more 
step 
toward 
her 
dream 
of 
Juneteenth. May we all draw inspira-
tion and strength from her example. 
I am proud to walk this path with 
you, Ms. Lee, and with all of you. Let’s 
keep this going. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from West Virginia. 
NOMINATION OF RADHIKA FOX 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to oppose the nomination of 
Radhika Fox to be Assistant Adminis-
trator for Water at the EPA. I cer-
tainly appreciate her willingness to 
serve, and I have found her to be quite 
personable and friendly. So this is not 
a personal statement. 
But even though she is not yet con-
firmed, she is already in place as the 
lead political appointee in the Water 
Office of the EPA. In that capacity, her 
recent announcement of overreaching 
regulatory proposals under the Clean 
Water Act cemented my opposition to 
her nomination. 
Ms. Fox’s position on the appropriate 
scope of the Clean Water Act was not 
clear last month when I voted on her 
nomination in the EPA committee, of 
which I am the ranking member. At 
that markup in May, I noted that I 
could not support Ms. Fox at that time 
because she would not commit to main-
taining the navigable waters protec-
tion rule issued in 2020. As I noted at 
the time, she would also not state that 
the 2015 waters of the United States 
rule was overreaching. So I really 
couldn’t pin her down on any opinion 
on this very important rule. 
I now know why she would not com-
mit 
to 
maintaining 
the 
navigable 
waters protection rule when she testi-
fied before the committee and avoided 
providing direct responses in her writ-
ten responses to my followup ques-
tions. The administration did not sup-
port the rule and, apparently, the EPA 
opposed it completely. 
Last week, Ms. Fox and EPA Admin-
istrator Regan, as well as the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, announced 
their plans to repeal and replace the 
rule in its entirety. EPA and the Corps 
of Engineers are going to completely 
rewrite the regulations that determine 
whether a business, a farm, or a citizen 
needs to obtain a Federal water permit. 
The Federal Agencies announced that 
they had decided they are not going to 
keep any part of that rule and that 
they are going to start from scratch. 
That was at odds with what Ms. Fox 
conveyed to me in a phone call that she 
did make the previous day to inform 
me they were going to be making an 
announcement. She was just very in-
complete, and it was extremely dis-
appointing to me and to the many 
States and businesses that support the 
navigable 
waters 
protection 
rule, 
which—unlike the 2015 waters of the 
United States rule it replaced—is the 
law presently. The navigable waters 
protection rule is the law of the land in 
all 50 States. That made it clear when 
Federal permits would be needed, and 
it gave States more control over how 
to permit water bodies in their borders. 
Throughout her nomination process, 
when I asked Ms. Fox about the admin-
istration’s plans, she expressed a desire 
to hear from stakeholders in order to 
create a ‘‘durable’’ rule. Ms. Fox did 
not conduct any formal public stake-
holder process before announcing the 
decision that was made to repeal the 
navigable waters protection rule. 
The administration has said it plans 
to repeal the rule and then put in place 
guidance from the 1980s while we wait 
and while they come up with a replace-
ment. Changing the regulations three 
times in a short period of time—2015, 
2020, and now 2021—simply does not 
meet her commitment to develop a 
‘‘durable’’ definition. 
Instead, ever-changing rules create a 
game of regulatory ping-pong across 
administrations. These are big far- 
reaching rules. That permitting uncer-
tainty hurts our economy at a time 
when we need growth, and it does so 
without additional environmental pro-
tection in my home State. 
We often forget that the Clean Water 
Act allows States to regulate their 
waters as much as they like. The defi-
nition of ‘‘waters of the United States’’ 
only determines Federal jurisdiction. 
In fact, that is the keystone of the 
Clean Water Act. 
The 
administration’s 
promises 
of 
transparency and creating regulatory 
certainty simply are not reflected in 
these actions, and their goals, stated to 
a briefing of congressional offices dur-
ing a briefing call, are particularly 
troubling. They pointed to the prior 
converted 
cropland 
exemption 
and 
treatment of ditches under the current 
rule as ‘‘implementation challenges’’ 
that they want to address. 
It doesn’t take much to understand 
what that means. The administration 
intends to require more Federal per-
mits for prior converted cropland and 
ditches on private land. That is a gross 
overreach of the Federal Government’s 
authority under the Clean Water Act, 
and it is questionable whether the EPA 
and the Army Corps of Engineers could 
even vet the sheer volume of permit ap-
plications that would come their way. 
I encourage Ms. Fox to engage with 
stakeholders from agriculture to min-
ing, to construction, to home building 
before issuing the official proposal to 
repeal the navigable waters protection 
rule, and I urge Ms. Fox to make that 
engagement meaningful. Simply check-
ing the box that these stakeholders 
have had the opportunity to talk to 
members of the administration is not 
meaningful engagement. 
If officials of the administration 
truly engaged in a transparent process 
where they took stakeholder feedback 
into account, they would learn that the 
best way to provide regulatory cer-
tainty is to keep that navigable waters 
protection rule in place. I cannot sup-
port Ms. Fox’s decision to undo such a 
foundational rule without any public 
engagement and to do so in a way that 
appears to be more expansive than the 
overreaching Obama rule called the 
‘‘waters of the United States rule.’’ 
So I urge my colleagues to vote 
against Ms. Fox’s nomination on the 
basis of what she has already done and 
in most probability will do in the fu-
ture surrounding this very, very impor-
tant topic. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Louisiana. 
NUCLEAR ENERGY 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk for a few minutes about nuclear 
energy. President Biden, of course, as 
we both are aware, has called climate 
change the ‘‘existential threat.’’ He 
says it is the ‘‘number one issue facing 
humanity today.’’ Secretary Kerry, 
who, as we know, is President Biden’s 
climate envoy, has said that climate 
change is a ‘‘life and death’’ issue. 
President Biden’s National Climate Ad-
visor, the Honorable Gina McCarthy, 
believes that saving the environment is 
the ‘‘fight of our lifetimes.’’ 
If you ask many Members of Con-
gress, not all of them—I don’t want to 
paint with too broad a brush—but if 
you ask many Members of Congress 
what they think the solution to our en-
vironmental issues is, they will prob-
ably respond: renewable energy. But if 
we are really worried about the cli-
mate—and I know we all are; we all 
want clean air, and we all want bright 
water—I suggest that we also embrace 
nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is not 
only safe, but it is clean and, frankly, 
it can produce more power than renew-
ables. 
Nuclear energy, as you know, creates 
little or no carbon emissions. Let me 
say that again. A lot of people don’t re-
alize it. Nuclear energy creates little 
or no carbon emissions. It also creates 
very little waste—an extraordinarily 
small amount of waste. All the nuclear 
waste that America’s commercial nu-
clear industry has ever produced—ever,

in the history of ever—can fit into a 
single football field to a depth of fewer 
than 10 yards. Now, you compare that 
with solar panels, for example—solar 
panels create 300 times more toxic 
waste than nuclear plants in order to 
yield the same exact amount of en-
ergy—or compare the waste from nu-
clear power production with wind tur-
bine blades. Wind turbine blades are 
very hard to recycle, and they usually 
end up in landfills. 
These facts are underreported, but 
the fact is that solar and wind power 
do have their own harmful impacts on 
our environment. There is no free 
lunch, as you know, and you don’t get 
one now. There are pros and cons of ev-
erything. 
Solar and wind can’t hold a candle to 
nuclear power when it comes to effi-
ciency. That is just a fact. It takes 
more than 3 million solar panels or 
more than 430 wind turbines to produce 
the same amount of energy as the aver-
age nuclear plant. Let me say that 
again—3 million solar panels, 430 wind 
turbines to produce the same amount 
of energy as the average nuclear power-
plant. And these numbers do not take 
into account that solar panels, as we 
know, are useless when the Sun doesn’t 
shine, and wind turbines are nothing 
more than expensive paper waste when 
the wind doesn’t blow. 
Also underreported, in my judgment, 
is how safe nuclear energy is. Despite 
what some people may think, Homer 
Simpson does not run America’s nu-
clear powerplants. The industry is con-
stantly evolving to make nuclear pow-
erplants safer, to make them more effi-
cient. In fact, we have all read a lot 
about small modular reactors. I will 
just use that as an example. These 
small modular reactors are part of a 
very promising new generation of ad-
vanced reactors that can automati-
cally—automatically—prevent 
over-
heating. And, frankly, they produce 
even less nuclear waste. 
Now, I want to be clear. I still believe 
in fossil fuels. I am an ‘‘all of the 
above’’ energy advocate, but leading 
that pack is fossil fuels. 
America’s economy is the largest in 
all of human history, and it can’t run 
without oil and gas. Louisianans know 
this, and most Americans know this. 
The people of Louisiana serve our 
country pretty well by contributing to 
our energy independence, and I am 
very proud of that. 
Last year, Louisiana supplied 9 per-
cent—9 percent—of America’s mar-
keted gas. And Louisianans under-
stand, as do, I think, most Americans, 
that giving up on fossil fuels would not 
only destroy jobs; it would ruin the 
economy. 
But I want America to use every ad-
vantage that it has. I want America to 
use every energy tool at its disposal. 
Now, that is why nuclear energy—I see 
nuclear energy as supporting oil and 
gas, not replacing it. I want to be clear 
about that, as supporting oil and gas, 
not replacing it. 
Since nuclear energy holds such 
promise—and it does—I am hoping that 
my Democratic friends in Congress and 
my Republican friends in Congress—be-
cause I see this as a bipartisan issue— 
will lend their full-throated support to 
nuclear energy. 
I am not saying that renewables 
don’t have their proper place in Amer-
ica’s 
energy 
policy—they 
certainly 
do—and I am not saying we should get 
rid of them—I am certainly not—but 
we need to acknowledge that renew-
ables have limitations. They have limi-
tations, and nuclear energy does not. 
There are disadvantages to renewables. 
As I said, there is no free lunch, and 
you don’t get one now. 
Now, for some people, that is a lesson 
that needs to be repeated. I take note. 
I say this gently, but the Democratic 
Party platform, for example, calls for 
installing 500 million solar panels—500 
million solar panels—and 60,000 wind 
turbines over the next 5 years. This 
will occupy a lot more land and actu-
ally create less energy than building 
new nuclear reactors. And that is a 
fact. 
Some small modular nuclear reactors 
are roughly twice the length of the av-
erage schoolbus—twice the length of an 
average schoolbus. Wind farms, on the 
other hand, can eat up more than 19 
square miles. That is about half the 
size of Disney World—half the size of 
Disney World, compared to twice the 
length of the average schoolbus. If we 
succeed in blanketing our land with 
solar panels and wind farms, it is going 
to create more waste, occupy more 
green space, and ultimately weaken 
our economy. 
Again, I am not saying no to solar 
and wind. I am not at all. I am saying 
yes to explore the possibilities of nu-
clear energy. 
President Biden, as we know, has a $2 
trillion infrastructure plan. And I 
think, if nothing else, his infrastruc-
ture plan establishes the Biden admin-
istration’s priorities. His plan does call 
for $61 billion in initiatives that in-
clude investments in advanced nuclear 
technology. I am not sure I agree on 
the amount, but I like the concept, and 
I find that to be prudent. But it also 
asks for three times that amount—$174 
billion—to support electric vehicles, 
electric cars. I suggest that nuclear en-
ergy has more place in energy’s future, 
and it is something that we ought to 
talk about. 
Other spending bonanzas in President 
Biden’s plan include a $213 billion in-
vestment to give 2 million buildings a 
Green New Deal makeover and $100 bil-
lion to make our schools greener. 
These are not going to have a more 
meaningful impact on our environment 
than exploring nuclear energy. They 
are just not. 
I know that nuclear energy sounds 
too good to be true, and I don’t want to 
oversimplify the circumstances. Nu-
clear energy has its drawbacks, but nu-
clear energy is powerful. Nuclear en-
ergy is safe. Nuclear energy is clean. 
And by building up our nuclear power 
capabilities, the United States can cre-
ate more jobs; the United States can 
strengthen 
its 
economy; 
and 
the 
United States can ensure its place as a 
world leader on energy. And we can do 
all that while reducing carbon emis-
sions. 
I hope my colleagues will come to 
embrace nuclear energy as the efficient 
green energy source that it is and that 
the U.S. Congress can work with the 
White House to improve America’s 
standing as an energy juggernaut. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from New Jersey. 
RODRIGUEZ V. PAN AMERICAN HEALTH 
ORGANIZATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express significant con-
cern about the Biden administration’s 
decision to file an amicus brief in the 
case of Ramona Matos Rodriguez v. 
Pan American Health Organization. 
This case involves serious allegations 
that the Pan American Health Organi-
zation facilitated human trafficking 
and regrettably places the administra-
tion in a position in which it is under-
cutting efforts by the victims of the 
Cuban 
dictatorship’s 
forced 
labor 
schemes. 
Now, let me be clear, I am a strong 
advocate for the Pan American Health 
Organization and its mission strength-
ening health systems across Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Given the 
significant impact of COVID–19 on the 
region, PAHO’s efforts are needed now 
more than ever, and I have fought to 
ensure that the Pan American Health 
Organization has the resources it needs 
to carry out its lifesaving work during 
the pandemic and throughout a good 
period of time of my congressional ca-
reer. However, I also firmly believe 
that the Pan American Health Organi-
zation must be held accountable for its 
past transgressions, including the un-
acceptable role that it played facili-
tating a program that subjected more 
than 10,000 Cuban medical professionals 
to forced labor conditions in Brazil. 
From 2013 to 2019, the Pan American 
Health Organization profited from its 
participation in Brazil’s Mais Medicos 
Program, an initiative that allowed 
Cuba’s dictatorship to earn income 
from trafficking doctors. 
The Cuban regime’s so-called foreign 
medical missions are nothing more 
than human trafficking. In November 
of 2019, the United Nation’s Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
slavery and the United Nation’s Spe-
cial Rapporteur on trafficking in per-
sons raised concerns that the Cuban re-
gime’s trafficking of medical profes-
sionals constitutes forced labor and 
modern slavery. 
In fact, the Department of State’s 
last ‘‘Trafficking in Persons’’ report 
found the Cuban regime garnishes the 
wages of its medical professionals that 
serve overseas, surveils them, con-
fiscates their passports so they can’t

leave anywhere, and retaliates against 
family members in Cuba if they leave 
from the program. So if you send me 
abroad, don’t pay me, get money from 
the country that you send me from, 
take away my passport, and retaliate 
against my family, that is the ultimate 
forced labor. Cuba’s dictatorship gen-
erated more than $6 billion in profit 
from its forced labor schemes in 2018 
alone as it trafficked tens of thousands 
of Cuban medical professionals to some 
60 countries. 
The Pan American Health Organiza-
tion’s participation in the Cuban dicta-
torship’s human trafficking programs 
cannot be overlooked, and account-
ability is urgently needed. 
It is against this backdrop that I 
have reviewed the Biden administra-
tion’s amicus brief in Rodriguez v. Pan 
American Health Organization. And 
while the brief addresses some of the 
technical aspects of the case, it effec-
tively does nothing—nothing—to con-
demn Cuba’s dictatorship for human 
trafficking 
or 
the 
Pan 
American 
Health Organization’s participation in 
those programs that were human traf-
ficking. 
For over two decades, the United 
States has led the international com-
munity in combating human traf-
ficking. In 2000, the United States en-
acted the Trafficking Victims Protec-
tion Act—something I was involved 
with in the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee—which has set a standard 
for countries around the world to 
strengthen efforts to prosecute traf-
fickers, increase protection for vic-
tims, and expand foreign assistance 
programs. We have built a range of fi-
nancial tools to combat the human 
trafficking industry and its illicit prof-
its. We have spearheaded efforts to en-
sure that slavery-free supply chains— 
slavery-free supply chains—that re-
spect 
workers’ 
rights 
and 
prevent 
against forced labor conditions around 
the world become more and more a re-
ality. 
The Biden administration squandered 
an opportunity in this brief, an oppor-
tunity to support Cuban trafficking 
victims and an opportunity to advance 
our extraordinary American leadership 
in combating all forms of human traf-
ficking and modern slavery. It is a 
major disappointment. 
I urge the President and the Sec-
retary of State to redouble efforts to 
pressure Cuba to end this medical traf-
ficking program and the many other 
abuses it perpetrates against the Cuban 
people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we 
have been told by the majority party 
that soon we will be having a vote on 
an 800-page bill to change 50 State vot-
ing laws to 1 Federal law. This bill is 
called the For the People Act. It was 
compiled after the 2018 elections to call 
into question the legitimacy of demo-
cratic elections for partisan political 
purposes. 
If it had been a serious attempt at 
legislating, there would have been 
some outreach to some Republicans be-
cause it takes 60 votes, a bipartisan 
vote, to get anything through the U.S. 
Senate. 
In that process, there would have 
been consultation also with local elect-
ed officials—the election officials who 
conduct the State elections—to make 
sure it was workable. There would have 
been hearings in the Congress. There 
would have been revisions from the bill 
originally introduced. 
The fact that back in 2018, when it 
was introduced, is the fact that it was 
intended as political propaganda, and 
that betrays the absurdity of the title, 
the ‘‘For the People Act.’’ 
Also, 
despite 
Senator 
SCHUMER’s 
using Senate rule XIV in the last Con-
gress to bypass the committee and put 
the bill directly on the Senate cal-
endar, Senator SCHUMER never used his 
right to force a vote on moving to the 
bill. At that time, the Democratic nar-
rative was that Republicans were not 
doing enough to secure the election so 
the results might end up being in 
doubt. Now, what we know from hap-
pening in the last election, that argu-
ment is out the window now. 
Since the Democrats got the results 
they wanted, they endlessly quote the 
Trump administration’s top cyber se-
curity official declaring the 2020 elec-
tion the most secure ever in history. 
I assumed last Congress that Senator 
SCHUMER would wait until right before 
the 2020 election to force a vote so he 
could accuse Republicans of blocking 
an election bill for their campaign nar-
rative questioning election security. 
Instead, they repeatedly, dishonestly, 
blamed 
the 
Republican 
leader 
for 
blocking the bill, ignoring the fact that 
the Democratic leader had reserved the 
possibility of forcing a vote. 
The For the People Act is a mes-
saging bill. The bill has now been re-
introduced and recast as a response to 
a few State election security laws. A 
handful of relatively modern reforms 
at the State level have been shame-
lessly and falsely characterized as 
voter suppression, even considering the 
fact that in the last election, the win-
ner got the highest number of votes of 
any winner for President in the history 
of the United States, and the loser got 
the highest number of votes of any can-
didate for President of the United 
States throughout our history. 
As I have mentioned before, the 
claim by some Trump supporters that a 
certain 
brand 
of 
voting 
machine 
switched votes, I pointed out that that 
was lifted entirely from the Democrats’ 
2004 playbook. And President Trump’s 
questioning of his loss in Georgia was 
simply following in the footsteps of the 
losing candidate for Governor of Geor-
gia 2 years before. The Georgia Demo-
crat lost by over 50,000 votes in 2018 and 
has never even bothered to try to prove 
voting irregularities on that scale. 
Foreign adversaries like Russia and 
China cast doubts on the soundness of 
our democratic system, both to weaken 
us from within and to justify their own 
repressive regimes. American politics 
should not do these repressive regimes 
propaganda jobs for them, but too 
often we tend to be doing that. 
This bill is being called democracy 
reform. I support our American demo-
cratic system. All Americans should be 
proud of it. We can and should have 
confidence in our elections. Our democ-
racy does not need a fundamental re-
write because our democracy works. 
Let’s stop casting doubt on American 
elections, stop casting aspersions on 
the commonsense election security 
measures supported by Americans of 
all backgrounds. Let’s work together 
to boost the confidence of all Ameri-
cans in our elections. 
This bill would register illegal aliens. 
It would do away with State voter ID 
laws. It would have taxpayer-funded 
elections. 
I remember what our colleague Sen-
ator CRUZ said. In the first quarter of 
this year, he raised—it must have been 
in the neighborhood of about $5 million 
from contributors of under $200. So if 
you get that kind of money, under this 
bill, from people under $200, for every 
dollar you get, you get $6 from the tax-
payers. So Senator CRUZ, I am told, 
would get about $34 million of taxpayer 
funds to use for political purposes. We 
don’t need to replace 50 State voting 
laws as this 800-page bill would. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, you and 
I, as we sit on the Rules Committee, 
saw the debate on this bill—the bill 
that the sponsors call the For the Peo-

rately could be called the ‘‘For the 
Politicians Act.’’ S. 1 was marked up in 
the Rules Committee last month, a 
markup that I certainly raised a num-
ber of concerns about the bill and oth-
ers did too. It is more than 800 pages

that nobody has seen yet. But this bill 
seems to get bigger over time, not 
smaller over time. 
It includes the overwhelmingly bad 
idea that Congress should impose a 
Federal takeover of elections and force 
a one-size-fits-all approach on the more 
than 10,000 voting jurisdictions in the 
country. 
There are very few things that you 
can develop a formula that works just 
right in 10,000 places. In fact, in our 
States and in the District of Columbia, 
we have a pretty significant problem 
coming up with 51 different structures 
that work for everywhere in every ju-
risdiction that is impacted by that. 
This bill also has some deadlines that 
are so short that if it became law, it 
would create chaos in next year’s elec-
tions and make the election process 
less trusted, not more trusted. 
We should be focusing on Federal 
laws and State laws that make it easi-
er to vote and harder to cheat. I think 
this bill makes it easier to cheat and 
harder to figure out whether anybody 
cheated or not. 
S. 1 undermines the popular State 
voter identification laws. The majority 
of our States now require some kind of 
identification. And an overwhelming 
number of voters believe that voter 
identification at the polls is a good 
thing. 
This bill allows political operatives 
to fan out across a community and col-
lect an unlimited number of ballots. In 
fact, it says States can’t even stop that 
process of ballot harvesting. Those bal-
lot harvesters can collect ballots from 
you. They can collect ballots from your 
neighbors, from vulnerable voters like 
people in nursing homes. And, frankly, 
who knows if they turn them in or not? 
Who knows if they put them in the post 
office box or not? If they never show 
up, the ballot harvester, who may very 
well know that your ballot is a ballot 
they don’t agree with, could just say, 
‘‘Well, I don’t know what happened. It 
must have been lost in the mail,’’ and 
who would ever know whether it was 
lost in the mail or not? 
In addition to undermining voter 
identification laws and making it pos-
sible for complete strangers to take 
your ballot, S. 1 disrupts States’ long- 
made efforts to maintain an accurate 
list of eligible voters. Voter rolls are 
the foundation really of election ad-
ministration. I was the chief election 
official in our State. I was a local elec-
tion official in our State. 
Accurate lists of who can vote that 
people can look at before the election, 
during the election, and after the elec-
tion create great confidence in the 
process. 
Accurate lists ensure that voters are 
able to cast a ballot—and the ballot 
they should cast—in the districts they 
actually live in. That can be pretty 
complicated 
sometimes, 
and 
really 
only the election authority can be 
aware of that when they know exactly 
where you live. 
Election officials, when you have ac-
curate lists, know who has voted, and, 
frankly, they know who hasn’t voted. 
So if the same person comes in or at 
least a person pretending to be the 
same person comes in a second time, 
they know that. 
Accurate voter lists allow voters to 
check in more quickly to get that effi-
cient and quick exercise of democracy 
done. 
One of the things everybody con-
stantly talks about is, well, we make it 
too hard to vote. If you really want to 
make it hard to vote, make it hard to 
figure out who the voters are who are 
supposed to be voting at a given pre-
cinct. 
The right to vote is a bedrock prin-
ciple in our democracy. The right to 
vote wherever you want to vote is not 
a bedrock principle in our democracy. 
You can’t just decide: Well, this year I 
think it is going to be pretty competi-
tive in some other State. I will just 
drive over there on election day and 
vote. Frankly, you can’t just decide: 
You know, that congressional district 
next door to the one I live in looks 
more competitive than the one I live 
in. I think I will go over there and vote 
this year instead of in the district that 
the census tract would have put me in. 
The right to vote is a bedrock prin-
ciple. The right to vote wherever you 
want to isn’t. Some of our great local 
administrators figured this out. In St. 
Louis County, the biggest single elec-
tion jurisdiction in Missouri, you can 
vote anywhere in the county, but at 
the place where you go vote—the ballot 
for you individually is generated at the 
place you go vote, and it is counted in 
the races that are generated for you to 
vote in. That is pretty innovative. I 
don’t think we could probably have 
ever figured that out at the national 
level. 
But the point is, you are voting for 
the people who you are living in the 
district that person will represent, 
whether it is on the local school board 
or in the Congress or in the State legis-
lature. That is a very complicated set 
of things that benefit totally from 
voter rolls and benefit from you voting 
where you live. 
This bill prohibits States from put-
ting in place really just reasonable 
election security measures that have 
been upheld by court. It takes away 
the guardrails that prevent fraud from 
happening and ensures that when you 
do have fraud, you have ways to figure 
out that fraud occurred and what to do 
about it. You pile up all the ways this 
legislation actually increases the like-
lihood of fraud, and you think about 
whether you really need a strong rea-
son to change the system when, as Sen-
ator GRASSLEY said, the system ap-
pears to be working pretty well. 
Democracies benefits from local re-
sponsibility. One political party, how-
ever, thinks this bill will give it an 
electoral 
advantage. 
They 
have 
thought that for about 20 years. This is 
the compilation of 20 years of Demo-
crats in the Congress thinking, what 
could we do to change the election law 
that would be helpful for us? That is 
where we are in this legislation. It was 
written by one party alone. It has been 
steered through Congress by one party 
alone. It has not actually been seen by 
anybody in the other party yet, and the 
majority leader says this bill, which 
probably still is going to be about 800 
pages, will come to the floor next 
week. In both Chambers of Congress, 
there has been bipartisan opposition to 
the bill and no bipartisan support for 
this bill. 
The danger of those kinds of sweep-
ing changes really can do a lot to nega-
tively impact our election system, but 
it doesn’t stop there. It would turn the 
Federal Election Commission into a 
partisan tool where the party of the 
President has a majority. There is a 
reason that six-member Commission 
was equally divided when it was set up, 
just like there is a reason the Senate 
Ethics Committee is equally divided. 
This bill would send Federal money 
to campaign coffers at the rate of $6 for 
every dollar raised for every contribu-
tion under $200. I think the number my 
friend Chairman GRASSLEY was talking 
about was if you raised $5 million of 
under $200, you would get $30 million 
from the Federal Government—$30 mil-
lion of government money that could 
clearly be used for something else. In 
fact, the current Members of the Sen-
ate would be eligible under the total 
restrictions of the bill to get $1.8 bil-
lion in Federal money. Talk about a 
conflict of interest when you vote for 
this bill. 
The bill also changes redistricting es-
tablished in the Constitution for the 
States and basically ensures that all 
congressional redistricting would be 
done by Federal courts. That doesn’t 
affect the Senate much, but it affects 
the government a lot. It places heavy 
burdens on free speech and impacts 
every branch of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
I have heard proponents of this bill 
say that it is necessary to push back 
recently passed State voter laws and 
protect the voting rights of Americans. 
This bill has nothing to do with voting 
rights. It doesn’t protect the right of a 
single American to cast a ballot. It 
doesn’t bring new people into the sys-
tem as the constitutional amendment 
did on women and other people who 
have been added, people who had been 
held in a terrible way in slavery, people 
who had been prevented from voting 
because of their sex or race, and people 
who were prevented because of age at 
one time. This bill does nothing of 
that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4567 
June 16, 2021 
This is a Federal takeover of elec-
tions. It should be rejected by the Sen-
ate. I believe it will be rejected by the 
Senate. We look forward to seeing the 
other side defend this bill next week. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). 
The 
Senator 
from 
West 
Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from Missouri, 
Senator BLUNT, for his leadership on 
this issue. 
We had the hearing and the markup 
in the Rules Committee. I think that 
we could tell from the debate that the 
amount of holes and misinformation 
that is contained within S. 1 is the rea-
son that I call it the so-called For the 
People Act. 
Ronald Reagan famously said that 
the nine most terrifying words in the 
English language are ‘‘I’m from the 
government, and I’m here to help.’’ 
This can be applied to many examples 
of what we do here. 
What seems more pertinent, I think, 
now is this latest partisan attempt to 
federalize one of America’s most sacred 
functions, and that is our elections. 
Advocates claim that this sweeping ef-
fort, which comes in the form of legis-
lation ironically called For the People 
Act, is to get more people to vote. 
Let’s be clear. Everyone—Republicans, 
Democrats, Independents—we all want 
to see more people voting. The good 
news is that we have already been 
doing that across the country and in 
my home State of West Virginia. 
Remember, last year we were voting 
under a pandemic, under incredibly dif-
ficult situations for everybody. Our 
State of West Virginia ran a very suc-
cessful election suited to our State. We 
had thousands more people vote in 2020 
than they did in 2016. In fact, the total 
number of ballots cast in 2020 was more 
than any other election in West Vir-
ginia’s history, with the exception of 
the 1960 election. The 1960 election, re-
member, was the Presidential election 
that President Kennedy won after he 
had a very successful and a pivotal vic-
tory in the primary in West Virginia as 
the first Roman Catholic running for 
President. More than 158 million bal-
lots were cast in 2020. That is a 7-per-
cent increase since 2016. This is under a 
pandemic. 
Every State decided the best way to 
get maximum participation. Last No-
vember, every single State saw higher 
turnout rates compared to the previous 
Presidential election. If more people 
are, in fact, voting, what is this Demo-
cratic-proposed 
legislation 
really 
about? And that is where it is about 
the federalization of elections and elec-
tion power grab. I believe it lacks 
credibility. It is really about a way to 
implement absurd and downright un- 
American provisions in the bill that 
prioritize power over the will of the 
people. 
I am glad to say that some of my 
Democratic colleagues are finally ac-
knowledging the concerns with this 
bill. 
During 
the 
Rules 
Committee 
markup, Republicans and Democrats 
offered a number of amendments, some 
of which were adopted on a bipartisan 
basis. That is what we are supposed to 
do—work it through committee. These 
amendments have been heralded by 
some of my Democratic colleagues as 
an example of how we can work to-
gether on this issue. 
Despite the bipartisan amendments 
in the Rules Committee—despite this— 
the version that the majority leader 
may bring up for a vote does not in-
clude any of the amendments that were 
adopted 
during 
the 
markup 
even 
though they had bipartisan support. To 
me, that is a clear sign that the major-
ity is not trying to cooperate in good 
faith 
but, 
rather, 
trying 
to 
ram 
through a partisan bill that will en-
croach on the States’ abilities—my 
State’s ability—to ensure a free and 
fair election and a well-attended elec-
tion at the same time. 
The legislation would strip States of 
their constitutional authority to run 
elections and allow the Federal Gov-
ernment to determine what is best. 
It would ban voter ID laws, which are 
adopted in many States, mine included, 
which maintain the integrity of elec-
tions in my State and the majority of 
others. Quite frankly, I haven’t heard 
one person in my State complain about 
having to take an ID to the polls or to 
submit an ID with their vote. 
The bill would also force States to 
administer same-day voter registra-
tion—a 
cumbersome 
mandate 
that 
many States won’t be able to comply 
with for dozens of reasons. In my 
State, 
it 
is 
internet 
connectivity. 
Many of our polling areas wouldn’t be 
able to accept same-day registration 
because they can’t connect, unfortu-
nately, to the bigger system to find out 
if this person is fraudulent or not. 
It would also require that States 
mandate the unpopular and dangerous 
practice of ballot harvesting, which is 
ripe for fraud. Now, I will tell you, 
some States have made ballot har-
vesting legal. Some States have same- 
day voter registration. Good for them. 
They decided what is good for their 
State through the constitutional duty 
of States to run elections. 
Speaking of fraud, this bill would 
mandate absentee ballot boxes, drop 
boxes, and force county clerks to ac-
cept regular ballots filed in the wrong 
precinct without proof of residency, 
both of which leave the door open to 
voter fraud. 
If that is not enough, if signed into 
law, West Virginia’s e-voting system 
and others like it—this is the e-voting 
system that allows our Active military 
who are deployed overseas to be able to 
vote safely by their mobile phone, and 
the legislature opened that up to peo-
ple with disabilities to be able to use 
an e-voting system. This bill would se-
verely curtail that and negate it in 
many cases. That is an expansion of 
voting rights that this bill would take 
away. 
This legislation would allow govern-
ment funding of congressional cam-
paigns, with small donations being 
matched with Federal funds. Now, we 
heard from our friend Senator CRUZ in 
our committee. He talked about, if his 
contributions were matched for the 
first 3 months of this year, he would 
get millions of dollars, over $20 million 
of public financing for his campaign. I 
highly 
doubt 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues would want the Federal Gov-
ernment to help Senator CRUZ in the fi-
nancing of his campaign. As a matter 
of fact, he himself, Senator CRUZ, said 
he doesn’t want that at all either. 
The bill also would make the FEC, 
the 
Federal 
Election 
Commission, 
which oversees our elections and our fi-
nances, which is now a neutral three 
Republicans, three Democrats on the 
Commission, as it always has been—it 
would make it into a partisan majority 
vote. Well, if you are going to be mak-
ing decisions on my colleague from 
Florida’s election or my election on fi-
nancials, or the Presiding Officer’s 
election, do we really want a political 
organization making those? Not when 
we have had a nonpartisan FEC for 
years and have enforced our campaign 
laws and put them above party politics. 
But remember, this is only about get-
ting people to vote, so don’t worry. 
The disaster doesn’t stop with politi-
cizing the FEC; it would also remove 
the authority of States to draw district 
maps and would mandate how you do 
that. Our States can figure out how 
best—some of them have commissions. 
Some of them do it by the legislature. 
Some of them do it by the supreme 
court. Let’s let the States make that 
decision. 
I just think that the biggest dem-
onstration of opposition to this bill has 
come from the West Virginia County 
Clerk’s Association. It adopted a reso-
lution in opposition to S. 1 that 54 of 
the 55 county clerks in my State 
signed. 
These 
are 
Republican 
and 
Democratic county clerks. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
this letter from the West Virginia 
County Clerk’s Association. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JUNE 10, 2021. 
WVCCA RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE PASSAGE 
OF H.R. 1 & S. 1 
Whereas, the United States Constitution 
recognizes the authority of the legislatures 
of each State to regulate the times, places, 
and manner of holding federal elections; and 
Whereas, 
election 
administrators 
and 
county officials were not given an oppor-
tunity to provide input on the drafting of 
H.R. 1 and S. 1 prior to the introduction of 
the legislation, unlike previous bipartisan 
federal election reforms; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law 
that currently restricts ballot harvesting for 
the prevention of fraud, by expressly pro-
viding that states ‘‘may not put any limit on 
how many voted and sealed absentee ballots 
any designated person can return to the post 
office, a ballot drop-off location, tribally des-
ignated building, or election office’’; and

Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law 
by mandating same-day registration, regard-
less of the severe lack of internet service and 
broadband in rural areas: an impossible feat 
in West Virginia; and 
Whereas, Same-day registration provisions 
in H.R. 1 and S. 1 lack proper security pro-
tections, multiplied by the lack of internet 
capability in polling locations in West Vir-
ginia, which undermines the integrity of our 
elections by making it impossible for elec-
tion officials to confirm any new voter’s eli-
gibility prior to them casting any ballot or 
from guaranteeing that no voter both reg-
isters and votes more than once in an elec-
tion on Election Day; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law 
by prohibiting requirements for physical 
proofs of identification for regular in-person 
and absentee voters, and requiring states to 
accept just a voter’s signature affidavit as 
proof of eligibility and proper registration; 
and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law 
and adoption of voting systems by requiring 
decertification of current, federally certified 
voting systems, and forcing states to pur-
chase new voting equipment—none of which 
currently comport with the most recently 
adopted voluntary voting system guidelines 
(adopted Feb. 2021 by EAC)—wasting millions 
of dollars in recent upgrades purchased with 
HAVA funding across West Virginia and re-
quiring new manufacturing by vendors and 
purchases by counties to the tune of tens of 
millions of dollars in WV alone; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 creates multiple 
so-called ‘‘private rights of action’’ that 
would lead to election administrators being 
targeted for lawsuits all across the country 
for both real and imagined violations, and 
causing county clerks to spend more time 
defending themselves in court than pre-
paring to make sure that elections are run 
smoothly and securely; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 places dozens of 
additional mandates on county clerks while 
providing no ongoing operational funding to 
fulfill the requirements, causing potential 
cuts in county budgets to law enforcement 
and public safety; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law 
by forcing county clerks to accept regular— 
not provisional—ballots of voters who vote 
in the incorrect precinct, without sufficient 
evidence of eligibility or proof of residence; 
and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 fatally contradicts the re-
liability and security of electronic trans-
mission by permitting voters to cure signa-
ture deficiencies electronically (see Sec. 
1621) but prohibiting UOCAVA, voters living 
with disabilities, and first responders called 
away for service from transmitting absentee 
ballots securely using extensively tested pro-
cedures and methods; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 lump dozens of 
state agencies and educational institutions 
into ‘‘voter registration agencies,’’ and re-
quires them to integrate into an automatic 
voter registration system without regard to 
current systems, data collection practices, 
or security creating more opportunities for 
voters’ registrations to be mishandled and 
mistransmitted, and likely resulting in secu-
rity lapses for agencies currently not cov-
ered under the Critical Infrastructure des-
ignation of the Department of Homeland Se-
curity; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law 
by mandating new dates for the early in-per-
son voting period without regard to state- 
specific success and voter participation 
under current election calendars; and 
Whereas, H.R. 1 and S. 1 preempt state law 
by requiring absentee ballot drop boxes and 
increasing security concerns for absentee 
ballots that currently do not exist under 
state laws: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, that the West Virginia County 
Clerk’s Association opposes the passage of 
H.R. 1, S. 1, or any other legislation that im-
pedes the state’s ability to administer elec-
tions in an overreaching, one-size-fits-all ap-
proach out of Washington D.C.

Mrs. 
CAPITO. 
Madam 
President, 
they raise numerous grievances, many 
of which I have talked about. They 
talk about the voting machines they 
have right now, which they have spent 
a lot of money on, that would all be 
taken offline. You would have to fully 
replace all of that. They also fully re-
ject the usurping of what is their con-
stitutionally based responsibility to 
run elections safely, securely, and on 
time. So I appreciate the letter from 
our clerks and certainly understand 
their deep, deep concerns. The right to 
vote is a constitutional right, and on 
that, we are in agreement. 
I got to go to a citizenship ceremony 
wherein 20 new citizens joined our 
country after having waited to get into 
our country. After becoming citizens, 
the best and most precious right they 
get is that right to vote. Yet S. 1 is 
merely a partisan power grab that in-
cludes all kinds of unrelated, harmful 
provisions. It strips the States of their 
authority to run their elections. To put 
it simply, States do not need the Fed-
eral Government to strip them of their 
authority and impose burdensome re-
quirements to fix problems that do not 
exist. That is exactly what this bill 
does, and it is why the For the People 
Act does not live up to its name. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, the United States is a beacon of 
democracy in the world, and our Na-
tion was founded on free and fair elec-
tions, but if the American people don’t 
have confidence in our elections, we 
don’t have a sustainable democracy. 
Right now, unfortunately, many peo-
ple do not have confidence. People 
across the country are mad when they 
look at the blatant power grab by the 
Democrats to fundamentally change 
our democracy. Do you know what? 
They should be mad. We are talking 
about the sacred right to vote. 
If we want to continue as a thriving 
democracy, we have to take action so

Save Democracy Act so as to restore 
faith in our Federal elections and guar-
antee that voters decide the outcomes 
of elections, not the courts. 
I also introduced the Promoting 
Election Integrity by Proving Voter 
Identity Act so as to require voter ID. 
It is pretty simple. If you want to vote 
in person, you will need to bring your 
current and valid ID. If you want to 
vote by mail, you will need to provide 
a copy of your ID. Like I said, it is 
pretty simple and straightforward. If 
we want, and we do—we want 100 per-
cent participation in our elections, and 
we want zero fraud. We want it to be 
easy to vote and very hard to cheat. 
Voter ID helps us meet that goal. 
Of course, the Democrats will do any-
thing to fight against these common-
sense reforms. Instead, the Democrats 
are pushing S. 1, otherwise known as 
the Corrupt Politicians Act. S. 1 is the 
most ridiculous legislation I have seen 
since I have come to the Senate. I 
would need hours to go through all of 
it. For our purposes here today, I want 
to highlight just one piece of this lu-
nacy: using taxpayer dollars to pay for 
political campaigns. 
The Democrats want to use your tax 
dollars to subsidize their political cam-
paigns. Think about how anti-demo-
cratic it is to allow public servants to 
use the people’s money to manipulate 
the people themselves. Just to be crys-
tal clear, here is what is exactly being 
proposed by the Democrats in this 
anti-democratic bill: Public officials— 
the 
government—take 
money 
from 
you. Then they use that money to pay 
for their campaign ads in order to ma-
nipulate you. 
This bill is nothing but a political 
power grab by Washington Democrats. 
New Hampshire Democrat Secretary of 
State Bill Gardner even said recently 
that S. 1 was a power grab by the Fed-
eral Government that would ‘‘trample 
New Hampshire’s state constitution.’’ 
Under the Democrats’ plan, a can-
didate for the Senate in California 
could spend $80 million in taxpayer dol-
lars to run attack ads and fund his 
campaign—$80 million. In Georgia, a 
Senate candidate could get as much as 
$25 million in taxpayer money. Can-
didates in Arizona could get almost $19 
million. New York candidates would 
get more than $44 million. That doesn’t 
make any sense. 
What kind of return on investment 
are the American people getting when 
their hard-earned tax dollars are fund-
ing attack ads? Why is the Federal 
Government in the business of funding 
campaigns? Because my Democratic 
colleagues want the government to 
take your money and spend it on try-
ing to manipulate your vote. 
Only in Washington would a bunch of 
politicians look at the challenges from 
recovering from the pandemic and de-
cide the most important thing we can 
do is make taxpayers fund campaign 
ads. 
This is the most radical piece of vot-
ing legislation this Nation has ever 
seen at a time when restoring con-
fidence in our elections has never been 
more important. 
I was sent to the U.S. Senate to fight 
for Floridians and Americans against 
corrupt politicians. Here is my promise 
to every American family: I am going 
to fight every day to make sure the 
Democrats do not try to take your 
money to manipulate your vote. 
If we are serious about working to-
gether to move our country forward, 
restore public trust in our elections, 
and protect democracy, we need to re-
ject the insanity of S. 1 and look to 
commonsense reforms like voter ID. 
We will continue to fight the Demo-
crats’ election power grab and combat 
their efforts to prevent measures that 
protect the integrity of our elections. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it has been so interesting to talk 
with Tennesseans over the past couple 
of weeks, and it is interesting in the 
vein that they are beginning to really 
question some of the proposals that my 
Democratic colleagues are bringing 
forward and items that they are push-
ing from the left side of the aisle. 
I have to tell you that I honestly 
can’t blame them. After all, when they 
promised COVID relief, they delivered 
a blue State bailout, which was some-
thing that was not popular in Ten-
nessee. They said that they were going 
to be all for some much needed infra-
structure projects. In Tennessee, we 
like to talk about this in terms of 
roads and railways and runways and 
rivers. Yet what did the people from 
Tennessee hear? They heard all about 
the Green New Deal, they heard about 
incentives for electric vehicles, and 
they heard about alternative energy. 
They looked at that infrastructure bill 
and said: This is fantasyland. 
Then, when they promised to support 
families and children, what did you get 
from the left side of the aisle? You got 
support for expanding the welfare 
state. 
Now Senate Democrats have prom-
ised to vote on legislation that they 
claim is going to make our elections 
more transparent. Hmm. That is inter-
esting. Surprising no one, the bill the 
Democrats are trying to sell to the 
American people will do exactly the 
opposite. 
Of course, in typical fashion of the 
House, what did it do? It gave it a 
friendly sounding name—the For the 
People Act—but in actuality, this is a 
bill that would take away rights and 
responsibilities 
from 
the 
American 
people. 
They are saying: This is going to be 
about transparency. Well, when we 
think of transparency, we think of 
things that are going to be seen, of 
things that are going to be easily un-
derstood. We think of things from 
which the activity within is going to be 
made available so that people can see 
this. It should follow, then, that a bill 
that is promising transparent elections 
would be there to help voters under-
stand the rules, trust the people in 
charge, and cast their votes of con-
fidence. It would not be a bill that 
would seize control from local officials 
and place it in the hands of unelected 
Washington bureaucrats, and it would 
not be a bill that would make it lit-
erally impossible to stand up polling 
places. It certainly would not be a bill 
that would erode confidence in ballot 
integrity, but that is what we have. It 
just doesn’t make sense what they are 
trying to do when it comes to voting. 
Even with all of this, my Democratic 
colleagues have spent most of this year 
trying to sell the American public on a 
bill that would centralize power, that 
would impose burdensome rules on 
State and local governments, and that 
would take away constitutional re-
sponsibilities and rights and all but en-
sure rampant voter fraud. That is cor-
rect. A piece of legislation that would 
do—what?—make it easier to cheat. 
So, in the interest of the trans-
parency 
my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have promised, let’s take a closer look 
at the legislation they are pushing for-
ward. 
Like most proposals they have tried 
to force through this year, this latest, 
brazen political power grab is built on 
a foundation of unreasonable man-
dates—mandates from the Federal Gov-
ernment to the State and local govern-
ments. Yet, rather than simplifying 
the process, these new rules would 
throw your local elections into chaos. 
If passed, the provisions in this bill 
would mandate the use of ballot cast-
ing technology and voter registration 
systems that don’t even exist yet. That 
is correct. What is being mandated is 
not in existence, but when it does come 
to exist, you can bet that it will cost a 
fortune, that it will come with a steep 
learning curve, and that there will be 
buddies of the Democratic Party that 
will make a bucket of money. 
The same automatic registration pro-
cedures that failed voters in California 
and Illinois will fail voters in every 
State in this country. 
It would force States to stand aside 
for activists running ballot harvesting 
schemes—and, 
indeed, 
ballot 
har-
vesting is a scheme. Anyone who has 
ever watched one of these campaigns in 
action knows that forcing officials to 
tolerate them is an invitation for these 
activists to engage in a little sleight of 
hand, if you will. 
In fact, this bill truly outdoes itself 
when it comes to encouraging fraud. 
Its 
hallmark 
provision 
would 
ban 
meaningful voter ID laws and stop 
State and local officials from cleaning 
up their voter rolls. This bill strips 
away 
every 
commonsense 
defense 
against voter fraud. 
It would also inject fear into the 
process by mandating donor disclosure 
and 
weaponizing 
a 
partisan 
FEC 
against minority political parties.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4570 
June 16, 2021 
The American people know there is 
only one reason you would work this 
hard to remove transparency from elec-
tions: They are seeking to remove 
transparency from the voter. Truth be 
told, many of my colleagues across the 
aisle know it, too, which is why this 
bill has earned bipartisan opposition. 
I have spent the better part of 2 years 
coming to the floor to object to various 
iterations of this bill, and I will con-
tinue to do so until my colleagues 
abandon this partisan power grab. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am 
joining others who have the same prob-
lem with what the majority party here 
in the U.S. Senate is trying to do. It is 
something that surprises a lot of peo-
ple, something that would completely 
revamp, completely change, a system 
that has been in place since 1787. 
I understand that they are soon going 
to be forcing a vote on a bill they are 
naming the For the People Act, and it 
is anything but for the people. 
For those unfamiliar, this is a Demo-
crat bill to nationalize our elections 
and to give Washington unprecedented 
and unconstitutional power over States 
and local governments. 
Each speaker, including myself, who 
has spoken so far has been jealously 
guarding their system because we have 
put into place a very safe and honest 
way of handling our elections. 
Now, keep in mind, this bill is not 
new. House Democrats passed this back 
in 2019, right on party-line votes. In 
fact, the only bipartisan aspect of the 
bill is its opposition, as was just stated 
by another speaker. 
Back in March, along with every sin-
gle House Republican, one brave House 
Democrat voted against this bill, and 
the reason is clear—and it has been 
stated—but let me put all five of these 
things into one area so that it is a lit-
tle easier to understand. 
The bill is filled with dangerous, 
anti-democratic provisions—provisions 
that make it easier to steal votes. 
One, legalizing ballot harvesting. 
Each Member has been talking about 
ballot harvesting and the threat that is 
out there. 
Banning voter ID. In my State of 
Oklahoma, we have ID laws to safe-
guard our votes. 
They are attempting to restore fel-
ons’ right to vote. Why would you want 
to restore a felon’s right to vote? And 
I have not heard anyone yet give a 
good argument that is persuasive. 
Allowing voters to cast ballots out-
side of their precincts. That is just one 
step further and one step easier to fal-
sify ballots. 
Subsidize political candidates with 
Federal funds. We are going to talk 
about that. It is unbelievable. I men-
tioned some of the—how it might affect 
some individuals. 
It is more accurately named the ‘‘For 
the Liberal Politicians Act.’’ In their 
mind, it not only ensures that they can 
control elections forever with ballot 
harvesting 
and 
other 
questionable 
practices, but they would also give mil-
lions in taxpayers’ funds to bulk up 
their campaigns. 
I just reminded them, and others 
have mentioned this, too, it sounds 
like you might be criticizing TED CRUZ 
when you say this, but it is not because 
he knows it is wrong. He observed 
that—when he was running for office, 
that if he had been able to harvest the 
opportunities you have from the Fed-
eral Government, he would have raised 
some $24 million in Federal funds in 
the first quarter of this year for his 
campaign. 
The Oklahoma State Election Board 
Secretary, Paul Ziriax, shared with me 
his strong concerns about this bill and 
what it would do to my State of Okla-
homa and our election integrity laws. 
It would impose policies that con-
tradict State law, like legalizing ballot 
harvesting and preventing voter ID for 
in-person voting. 
As he is responsible for managing the 
elections in Oklahoma, he knows how 
bad this would be for Oklahomans. 
Today, 
Oklahoma’s 
elections 
are 
safe, secure, and fair. Secretary Ziriax 
said it best in 2019, when he testified 
before the House, that Oklahoma’s vot-
ing system is ‘‘one of the most reliable, 
most accurate, most secure, most effi-
cient, most cost-effective, and speedi-
est voting system in the entire world.’’ 
We pride ourselves on that. That is 
Oklahoma doing it, not the Federal 
Government—not the Federal Govern-
ment doing something that might ben-
efit one segment of our society. 
It is clear the Democrats are playing 
politics with S. 1. 
Now, following the 2020 Presidential 
election, Democrats complained about 
efforts to remove States from running 
their elections, but now Democrats are 
seeking sweeping Federal control over 
elections. 
I am going to mention something 
that no one has mentioned before, and 
I guess the only reason it comes to my 
mind is I have been doing this for a 
long period of time—being concerned in 
trying to preserve our electoral col-
lege. 
Back in 1787, we had a problem. They 
were putting together a Constitution 
to try to establish a way of voting in 
the United States of America that 
would be safe for everyone and be equi-
table. 
And so they came out and—they 
didn’t want to do it just on a one-per-
son vote because if you do that, that is 
a decided advantage for all of the large 
States. And so what they did was come 
up with what they called the electoral 
college, and that was that they made 
the effort to correct the problem. We 
are talking about back in 1787. 
In 1787, we had a system where we 
had four very large States and nine 
small States. So if you just—the four 
large States were comprised of more 
than 50 percent of the electorate so 
that wouldn’t work. That wasn’t going 
to work. And, of course, the same thing 
is true today. Today, nine States have 
a majority of the votes. 
And so it was the clear intent not to 
let the large States have control of our 
system. 
Now, I am sure some of the large 
States disagree with that. Some Demo-
crats—a lot of Democrats disagree with 
that because it would be a decided ad-
vantage in an interim election. 
So what we did, we established the 
electoral college, and I have committed 
that is my main cause right now be-
cause it is in jeopardy now. The elec-
toral college is being attacked on a 
regular basis. 
In fact, one of the prominent Demo-
crats who is currently in the leadership 
in the Democratic Party has intro-
duced a resolution to do away with the 
electoral college. That is something we 
cannot allow to happen. 
And, oddly enough, it has survived 
for, what, 233 years now—233 years. 
And yet, it has survived all that time, 
but there are those attacking it right 
now. 
So that is another one of the major 
issues that we are concerned with, and 
that is that we are not only giving up 
all the creativity and the safeguards 
that are in a secure system, put to-
gether not by the Federal Government 
but by the States, and trying to take 
that over for the Federal Government. 
They have been attempting to do this, 
now, for 230 years. They haven’t been 
successful, and I am hoping they will 
not be successful on my watch. 
Thank you. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
if H.R. 1, S. 1 were ever passed into law, 
it would forever be known as the 
‘‘Nancy Pelosi Power Grab Act.’’ 
This legislation lets the Federal Gov-
ernment take over our elections, which 
is clearly unconstitutional. 
Let’s talk about ballot harvesting to 
begin with. Most Americans believe 
that ballot harvesting is wrought with 
fraud and wrong. Frankly, it dilutes 
your vote. 
For decades, for centuries, Americans 
have woken up early in the morning on 
voting day to get to church, to vote 
early before they get to work. 
Can you just imagine how much see-
ing so many show up with a bag full of 
ballots, which can’t be vouched for— 
what it does to devalue your vote. 
Let’s talk about voter ID for a sec-
ond. I think most Americans—maybe 
at least 80 percent of Americans—be-
lieve that voter ID brings integrity to 
the election process. 
Certainly voter ID has worked for 
Kansas for years and brings about in-
tegrity to our election process. Just 
think about all the things that require 
an ID at this point in time. To rent a 
car today, if I wanted to check into a 
hotel, if I wanted to board an airplane 
tonight, I would need some type of 
identification.

June 16, 2021 
And I think the value of voting is 
even more than any of those and thus 
the need for some type of voter identi-
fication. This bill takes integrity out 
of the election process. 
Next, most Americans don’t want 
their tax dollars going to fund any 
elections, especially elections of the 
opposite party to which you belong, 
and I can certainly guarantee that no-
body wants to see more political at-
tack ads with their hard-earned tax 
dollars being spent. 
But let me tell you what I am for. I 
want to make it easier to vote and 
harder to cheat. I want to make it easi-
er to vote and harder to cheat. 
Ballot harvesting makes it easier to 
cheat. Getting rid of voter ID makes it 
easier to cheat. That destroys the in-
tegrity of the election process. 
This bill, simply stated, is just an-
other attempt at an unconstitutional 
power grab. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, today 
we are discussing S. 1, the so-called For 
the People Act. 
Now, this legislation takes a system 
that is actually working quite well and 
applies drastic, draconian, and des-
perate election reforms meant to keep 
Democrats in power. 
Now, why do I say the current system 
is working well? Well, let me tell you 
just how easy it is back home in my 
home county of Johnson County, IN, to 
cast one’s vote. 
You see, beginning 4 weeks before the 
election, you can vote early in person, 
with no excuses, Monday through Fri-
day, for at least 8 hours per day. The 
two Saturdays before the election, 
early voting was open for 7 hours each 
day. Monday, the day before the elec-
tion, early voting was open for 31⁄2 addi-
tional hours. And then on election day, 
polls were open for 12 hours. In total, 
that is 2011⁄2 hours of voting across 23 
days, over a period of 4 weeks. 
In total, you see, we afford Hoosiers 
plenty of opportunity to vote. 
And lest you think that my suburban 
county is somehow unique in the State 
of Indiana, let me disabuse you of that 
notion. In neighboring Indianapolis, 
they had 221 hours of early voting over 
that same period. 
Additionally, Hoosiers have the abil-
ity to vote absentee. Now, you can vote 
absentee in the State of Indiana by 
mail for 11 separate reasons, including 
being sick or caring for someone who is 
sick or working on election day. 
Now, colleagues, in the history of our 
country, voting has never been easier 
than it is right now. That is right. You 
may not see this in the media, but this 
is indeed true. 
You see, the truth bears it out right 
in the numbers. Last year, a larger per-
centage of the population voted than 
they had in any election since 18-year- 
olds were given the right to vote 50 
years ago. A larger proportion of the 
population voted than it had since over 
the last 50 years. 
Why aren’t we hearing this? 
According to the Census Bureau, 
voter turnout for African Americans 
and Hispanic Americans were up 3 and 
6 
percent, 
respectively, 
not 
down. 
Asian Americans saw a huge 10-percent 
increase. This is fantastic. 
Yet my colleagues on the left would 
have the American people believe that 
we are living in an era of extreme sup-
pression or, as President Biden dema-
gogically, dishonestly, and divisively 
called it, ‘‘Jim Crow on steroids.’’ 
So what exactly is the national 
Democratic response to this record 
turnout? 
Well, they would like to strip elec-
tion powers away from the States, 
States like Indiana, and give those 
powers to Democratic overlords here in 
Washington, DC. That is how we ended 
up with S. 1, the For the People Act. 
So for the folks back home, what is 
this For the People Act really all 
about? Why are we having this debate? 
Why are we going to have this vote? It 
is 
really 
about 
four 
things—four 
things. 
One, national Democrats want to 
fund their campaigns with your tax-
payer dollars. That is right. Under the 
For the People Act, a $100 campaign 
donation to NANCY
PELOSI
could be 
matched by $600 from taxpayers. 
I don’t know about, you know, my 
colleagues who are listening, but my 
neighbors work very hard for their 
wages and salaries, and I expect that is 
the case for them as well. They don’t 
want $600 to match $100 given to NANCY 
PELOSI. 
Two, national Democrats want to gut 
popular voter ID laws, like those in the 
State of Indiana. I know what Hoosiers 
believe. Hoosiers believe you should 
have to prove who you are in order to 
vote. Our voter ID law, incidentally, 
passed in 2005. It was challenged in the 
courts, and it was upheld in the Su-
preme Court of the United States by a 
vote of 6 to 3. 
But this bill, this For the People Act, 
says you don’t have to prove who you 
are. You don’t have to prove you are 
who you say you are in order to cast 
your vote. We will just take you at 
your word. That seems to me to be ripe 
for abuse. 
No. 3, the third thing this is all about 
is that national Democrats want to 
allow ballot harvesting. It is an awful 
word, and it is an awful thing—the har-
vesting of ballots. In Indiana, a mem-
ber of your household can already turn 
in your absentee ballot. You can do it. 
But under this law, anybody can turn 
in your ballot—or not turn it in—and 
there is no limit as to how many bal-
lots a single person can turn in—hun-
dreds of ballots, thousands of ballots. 
It is ripe for abuse. 
The final thing this is about is that 
national Democrats want to take con-
trol of the Federal Election Commis-
sion. They want to turn it into a par-
tisan committee. 
Now, everyone in this body believes 
that the right to vote is sacred. It is a 
sacred right that all of us have, and we 
ought 
to 
be 
able 
to 
exercise 
it 
unhindered and with fidelity. We are in 
this Chamber because each one of our 
respective constituents exercised their 
right to vote. That is how we earned 
our election certificates, and we all 
agree that our constituents need to be 
able to trust the systems in place that 
allowed them to cast their vote. 
So we can’t take that sacred right 
and turn it into a partisan exercise, as 
S. 1 proposes we do. That, my friends, 
is why this Senator will be voting no 
on S. 1, the so-called For the People 
Act. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, in 
each new Congress, the bill number S. 
1 is a sign of the majority’s priority 
legislation. It says a lot about the new 
Democrat majority that the bill they 
chose to design as S. 1 prioritizes them-
selves. 
This bill creates a Federal campaign 
fund to finance the expenses of can-
didates for Congress. Instead of ad-
dressing the important issues that are 
on the minds of my fellow Iowans—like 
the rising cost of gasoline, bread, milk, 
and all sorts of household goods—this 
bill literally takes money out of the 
paychecks of working Americans and 
puts it into the campaign coffers of 
Washington politicians. 
Rather than helping to get Ameri-
cans back to work, the Democrats’ top 
priority, again, is S. 1. Their top pri-
ority is to create a Federal jobs pro-
gram for political consultants and poll-
sters, taxpayer-subsidized robocalls in-
terrupting your family dinner, junk 
mail cluttering your mailbox, and at-
tack ads blaring—yes—on your TV. 
And, 
folks, 
you 
cannot—cannot— 
unsubscribe, either, because there is no 
opting out. 
Think about the politician you dis-
like the most. Now imagine your tax 
dollars funding their ads and fliers and 
campaign parties and rallies. That is 
what this bill does. 
That is right. The bill subsidizes poli-
ticians’ campaigns—your tax dollars 
helping to elect politicians who oppose 
your values. 
This idea is so unpopular that a New 
York poll found that the majority lead-
er’s own constituents oppose public 
funding of campaigns by a 3-to-1 mar-
gin. 
While the Democrats call the bill the 
For the People Act, a more apt title 
would be ‘‘Fund the Politicians Act.’’ 
It is about Washington politicians—the 
same ones who just brought back ear-
marks to pay for their pet pork 
projects 
with 
your 
tax 
dollars, 
prioritizing themselves. 
The bill not only subsidizes the cam-
paigns of politicians, it nationalizes 
elections. Washington would tell the 
rest of the country how you can select 
your representatives. It does so by cre-
ating a Federal workaround of State 
voter ID laws by effectively elimi-
nating the enforcement of State ID re-
quirements at the polls.

Think about what you are required 
to show an ID to do: drive a car, board 
a plane, buy a beer—and the list goes 
on. But Democrats think it is best if 
we don’t require an ID to vote. 
The majority of Americans disagree 
with Washington Democrats, and 77 
percent of voters support voter ID. A 
little known fact is that this includes 
support by 63 percent of Democrats and 
a vast majority of Black and Hispanic 
voters. 
It is all part of the Democrats’ larger 
scheme and total power grab to tilt our 
political system in their favor. First, 
eliminate the filibuster. Then, rig elec-
tions by eliminating election integrity 
laws like voter ID verification. Then, 
add new States, like the District of Co-
lumbia and Puerto Rico, that will elect 
Democrat Senators. And don’t forget 
the plan to pack the Court. 
There are just 50 Democratic Sen-
ators, but 60 votes are required to end 
debate on legislation in the Senate. 
Therefore, the Democrats must elimi-
nate the filibuster in order to pass S. 1, 
their 
priority 
legislation. 
That 
is 
right—changing the rules in order to 
fundamentally change our country. 
And I would remind folks that my 
friends across the aisle are seeking to 
abolish the very same tool—the fili-
buster—that they used 327 times last 
year alone when they were in the mi-
nority. If they chose to change the 
rules, they would destroy this Cham-
ber’s long, proud history as being the 
world’s greatest deliberative body. 
The Senate’s current assistant ma-
jority 
leader 
made 
it 
clear—very 
clear—in 2018, in no uncertain terms, 
that ending the filibuster would be the 
end of the Senate as it was originally 
devised and created going back to the 
Founding fathers. 
Because the takeover of elections is 
just as radical and largely unconstitu-
tional, the Democrats’ Court-packing 
scheme is another key component of 
enshrining S. 1. 
Folks, we can all see this for what it 
is—a transparent play for permanent 
political power. This is not about de-
mocracy. It is about changing the rules 
and tipping the scales to favor Wash-
ington Democrats. 
As a former local elections commis-
sioner, I believe elections are always 
best kept at the State and local level, 
and I will continue to push back on my 
colleagues’ attempts to federalize our 
elections system. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
NOMINATION OF RADHIKA FOX 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise today to urge our colleagues to 
join me in voting to confirm Radhika 
Fox—Isn’t that a great name, Radhika 
Fox?—to be Assistant Administrator 
for Water of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. 
Over the past 2 months, as Radhika 
Fox has gone through the confirmation 
process, I have had the real pleasure to 
come to know her and, frankly, to ad-
mire her. I am convinced that she is an 
excellent choice to lead the EPA’s Of-
fice of Water at a crucial time in the 
Agency’s history. 
Ms. Fox brings with her an impres-
sive, professional record of service and 
accomplishment spanning over two 
decades, working on water issues at the 
local, State, and Federal level. 
Most recently, before she was nomi-
nated for her position at EPA, Ms. Fox 
served as the CEO of the U.S. Water Al-
liance. There she worked hand-in-glove 
with organizations across this country 
representing a wide range of water 
stakeholders, from industries to mu-
nicipalities, from service organizations 
to consumer groups, and from agricul-
tural groups to environmental organi-
zations. What those organizations have 
said again and again about Radhika 
Fox is that she is an exceptional leader 
who will work day and night to come 
up with practical solutions for our 
country’s serious water challenges. 
Moreover, Ms. Fox will make sure that 
everyone’s point of view is heard and 
taken into account when EPA acts to 
protect our country’s precious water 
resources. 
And how do we know these groups 
say all these wonderful things about 
Radhika Fox? Because they have writ-
ten to us, urging the Senate to act 
swiftly to confirm her, again and again 
and again. In fact, over 80 prominent 
organizations 
that 
are 
key 
stake-
holders in the nation’s water policies 
have written letters in support of her 
nomination to this important post. 
When I say that over 80 organizations 
have written, I don’t mean that 80-plus 
organizations have signed on to a com-
mon letter—one letter of support. No, 
no, no. I mean that over 80 organiza-
tions have taken the time to write 
their own unique, thoughtful letters of 
support. 
In fact, the Senate Committee on the 
Environment and Public Works, which 
I am privileged to lead along with 
SHELLEY CAPITO of West Virginia, has 
been inundated with letters of support 
for Radhika Fox. Each letter describes 
the specific and positive impact that 
Ms. Fox has already had on issues of 
importance to those individual organi-
zations and the members of those they 
represent, and she has done it under 
previous professional positions consist-
ently. 
I will take a few minutes. I don’t do 
this very often, but I just want to take 
a few minutes here and actually go 
through some of these letters, these 80 
letters of support. They are remark-
ably consistent letters of great com-
pliment and praise for her and the kind 
of person she is and the kind of leader 
that she is. But I want to share the 
words of some of those who reached out 
to us. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
writes: 
Ms. Fox has worked to ensure that busi-
nesses and the groups that represent them 
are valued stakeholders in water infrastruc-
ture conversations. She has created plat-
forms to convene stakeholders from the 
water sector and industry through her lead-
ership. 
The U.S. Water Alliance, what do 
they say? The U.S. Water Alliance 
writes: 
Radhika Fox developed a consistent record 
of working cooperatively alongside stake-
holders from every corner of the water sec-
tor, including drinking water, wastewater, 
and stormwater utilities of all sizes, environ-
mental groups, labor, frontline communities, 
and countess others. 
How about the Family Farm Alli-
ance. Here is what the Family Farm 
Alliance writes: 
Due to her extensive engagement in policy 
and public discourse in her previous posi-
tions, Ms. Fox understands the implications 
of guidance and regulation but also the im-
portance of authentic community engage-
ment and the need to achieve quantified re-
sults on the ground. 
They go on to say: 
Radhika Fox is the type of leader to create 
the conditions to catalyze that work and ul-
timately see it through. 
Again, those are the words we re-
ceived from the Family Farm Alliance. 
How about the Iowa Soybean Asso-
ciation? We raise a lot of soybeans in 
our State, and I know the Presiding Of-
ficer raises a bunch in her State. And 
for this gentleman sitting over here on 
my left, they raise a few down in West 
Virginia. But the Iowa Soybean Asso-
ciation says: 
Ms. Fox understands how water manage-
ment issues are interwoven with the fabric of 
rural and urban communities and that farm-
ers must be part of the team and bene-
ficiaries of this work. This integration is key 
for making real and long-lasting progress on 
protecting and improving water in the 21st 
century. 
And here are some words from one of 
our neighbors in Delaware, off to the 
west of us, Maryland. Ben Grumbles, a 
Republican-appointed secretary of the 
Maryland’s Department of the Environ-
ment writes that Ms. Fox has ‘‘im-
pressed public and private sector water 
leaders on her abilities to find common 
ground and skillfully advocate for inte-
grated ‘One Water’ policies throughout 
the country. . . . Radhika is well-quali-
fied to organize, inspire, and lead 
EPA’s national water program and the 
many diverse constituencies who shape 
our water future. 
Thank you for those words, Ben 
Grumbles. 
Galveston. Galveston, TX, here we 
go. Galveston Bay Foundation down in 
Galveston, 
TX, 
says 
this 
about 
Radhika: 
Radhika is a proven leader who has dem-
onstrated a desire to make sure that all 
stakeholders and all voices have a place at 
the table. 
And, finally, last but not least, the 
Community Water Center—that is an 
outfit in Central California, not too far 
from where I was stationed when I was 
in the Navy. They write: 
Ms. Fox has the rare ability to bring mul-
tiple differing voices into the room (from en-
vironmental justice to water agencies to ag-
ricultural entities to state government lead-
ers), find the common themes, and then

June 16, 2021 
weave together a shared ground that helps 
advance the conversation and create real 
progress. You will be hard-pressed to find a 
more gifted visionary and leader in the water 
space than Ms. Fox. 
Those are amazing letters. Any one 
of them by themselves would be, I 
think, remarkable and compelling, but 
when you put them all together—from 
the Chamber of Commerce to environ-
mental organizations and agricultural 
organizations—we hear this theme re-
peated again and again. It is pretty 
amazing, and the reason why is because 
it turns out that Radhika Fox is an 
amazing human being and leader. 
These excerpts that I just shared 
with my colleagues today are really a 
small sample—this is just a small sam-
ple—of 
the 
expressions 
of 
over-
whelming support that our committee, 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, has received from organi-
zations and from people around the 
country who know water issues and 
who also know Radhika Fox. 
Their message is loud. Their message 
is clear. We have the opportunity today 
to confirm a truly gifted leader and put 
her to work serving our country right 
away from sea to shining sea. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in doing just 
that. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
NOMINATION OF TOMMY P. BEAUDREAU 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, 
today the Senate will be voting to in-
voke cloture on the nomination of 
Tommy Beaudreau. And I have to ex-
plain 
the 
difference 
between 
‘‘Bohdroh’’ 
and 
‘‘Beaudreau.’’ 
‘‘Bohdroh’’ is when you are up north in 
Alaska being raised, and that is how it 
is said and pronounced. It is spelled B- 
O-H-D-R-O-H. Now, if you are down in 
the South, especially in Louisiana, it 
would be all Beaudreau, which is B-E- 
A-U-X. So there is a difference here, 
and Tommy wanted to make sure that 
I explained that to you. 
Mr. Beaudreau has been nominated 
to serve as the Deputy Secretary of the 
Department of the Interior. I believe 
that he will be an outstanding Deputy 
Secretary. He is experienced. He knows 
the Department of the Interior, and he 
is familiar with the wide range of 
issues that come before it. 
He has previously served as the first 
Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management, as the Acting Assistant 
Secretary for Land and Minerals Man-
agement, and as Chief of Staff of the 
Department. His performance at his 
nomination hearing demonstrated that 
he has both a very firm grasp of the 
issues and the ability to listen, learn, 
and work with all sides and to find 
commonsense 
solutions 
to 
difficult 
problems. 
He has the knowledge, the experi-
ence, the temperament, and the skills 
needed to serve in this important posi-
tion. Mr. Beaudreau fully understands 
the role of the Department of the Inte-
rior in striking the balance in its dual 
mission of preserving and protecting 
our national parks and public lands 
and providing a large part of the en-
ergy and mineral resources that we 
need to power the Nation. 
And I believe Senators on both sides 
of the aisle will find that he is someone 
that 
they 
can 
work 
with. 
Mr. 
Beaudreau is supremely well qualified 
for the job. He was reported out of the 
Senate Energy Committee with a very, 
very strong bipartisan vote. I heartily 
support his nomination, and I encour-
age my colleagues to do the same. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today the Senate will take another 
step toward building a Federal judici-
ary that reflects the experiences of all 
Americans by voting on the nomina-
tion of Judge Lydia Griggsby to serve 
on the U.S. District Court for the Dis-
trict of Maryland. Once confirmed, she 
will be the first Black woman—and 
first woman of color—to serve in this 
position. 
Since 2014, Judge Griggsby has served 
as an outstanding and even-handed 
judge on the U.S. Court of Federal 
Claims. In fact, many of us in this 
Chamber are familiar with her intel-
lect and sound judgment. Prior to 
being nominated to the Court of Fed-
eral Claims, Judge Griggsby served as 
chief counsel for privacy and informa-
tion policy on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee 
under 
then-Chairman 
LEAHY. Before that, Judge Griggs by 
spent 10 years at the Department of 
Justice as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. 
Judge 
Griggsby’s 
long 
and 
distin-
guished career has earned her a unani-
mous rating of ‘‘Well Qualified’’ from 
the American Bar Association. 
She also received broad, bipartisan 
support in the Judiciary Committee, 
with 
five 
Republicans 
joining 
all 
Democrats to advance her nomination. 
And she has the strong support of her 
home State Senators, Senator CARDIN 
and Senator VAN HOLLEN. In 2014, the 
Senate confirmed Judge Griggs by by 
voice vote. I hope she will once again 
receive broad bipartisan support today. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor 
of her nomination.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1899 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I stand again today in support of 
our great ally Israel. Israel is a vibrant 
democracy that supports capitalism, 
champions human rights, and holds 
free and open elections. Israel is the 
only democracy in the Middle East, 
and Israel deserves our unwavering 
support. 
Israel is surrounded by nations and 
terrorist groups that want it wiped off 
the face of the Earth. I saw this first-
hand during my latest visit as Senator, 
which gave me a clear picture of 
Israel’s proximity to its enemies— 
Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, and Iran. 
At my last visit, I was about a half 
mile from the Gaza Strip and went to a 
kibbutz. What was shocking to me is 
that there were little children there in-
stinctively raised that, whenever they 
would hear the sirens, they instinc-
tively raised their hands because some-
body is going to pick them up and get 
them to a bomb shelter. I think what 
they were telling me when I was there 
is they had 15 seconds to get to a bomb 
shelter when the sirens went off, which 
said that Hamas was sending rockets. 
Also, they were told the story that 
Hamas 
was 
sending 
balloons 
with 
candy and explosives. So when the bal-
loon would come down, if the children 
would touch it, it would explode. It is 
disgusting. 
For 11 days last month, we saw rock-
ets rain down on Israel. As we watched 
Hamas 
terrorists 
target 
innocent 
Israeli citizens, I thought about the 
families impacted by this evil. Think 
about a 5-year-old you know. They like 
to play games. They love their brothers 
and sisters, and they love their mom 
and dad. Well, a 5-year-old, just like 
the one you are thinking of, named Ido 
Avigal was killed as Hamas rockets in-
discriminately just pounded Israel. His 
life was taken by Hamas terrorists. I 
have a 5-year-old grandson. I can’t 
imagine life without him. I can’t imag-
ine what either of those families is 
going through right now. 
Instead of coming together against 
this violence, we saw the Democrats 
turn their backs on Israel. I was proud 
to lead more than 30 of my colleagues 
in a resolution to support Israel in its 
right to defend itself against terrorist 
attacks. Unfortunately, it was blocked 
by Senate Democrats. 
It was not so long ago that the Sen-
ate stood with Israel on a bipartisan 
basis. In 2014, when Israel was again 
subject to a barrage of rockets tar-
geting innocent Israelis, then-Majority 
Leader Reid offered a resolution sup-
porting Israel’s right to defend itself 
against Hamas. Every single Senator 
voted to support Israel’s right to de-
fend itself against Hamas—not any-
more. It is despicable that something 
as simple as reaffirming America’s sup-
port for Israel no longer aligns with 
the priorities of the Democrat Party. 
I have also joined in a resolution 
with Senator CRUZ to approve the arm 
sales to Israel and the resolution with 
Senator HAWLEY to condemn the dis-
turbing wave of anti-Semitic and anti- 
Israel actions in Congress, in the 
United States, and around the world. 
These 
reprehensible 
and 
disturbing 
acts must be swiftly condemned at 
every level and those responsible pros-
ecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
President Biden’s State Department 
recently said: 
We’re going to be working in partnership 
with the United Nations and the Palestinian 
Authority to ‘kind of’ channel aid there in a 
manner that does its best to go to the people 
of Gaza. 
The official went on to say: 
As we’ve seen in life, as we all know in life, 
there are no guarantees, but we’re going to 
do everything that we can to ensure that 
this assistance reaches the people who need 
it the most. 
So the Biden administration can’t 
guarantee that American taxpayer dol-
lars aren’t going to fund terrorists in 
Hamas? 
The 
Biden 
administration 
thinks it is OK to fund Hamas terror-
ists because ‘‘in life there are no guar-
antees’’? 
The 
Biden 
administration 
seems unbothered if some funding goes 
to the terrorists that killed Ido. 
President Biden must do better. His 
administration must control where 
this money is going. Yes, we can make 
sure American tax dollars aren’t fund-
ing terrorists. What we are hearing 
from the Biden administration is they 
simply won’t take the time to do what 
it takes to guarantee that. This lack of 
accountability or concern is absolutely 
disgusting, and we should not allow it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4575 
June 16, 2021 
That is why I, along with Senators 
JONI
ERNST, CINDY
HYDE-SMITH, and 
MIKE BRAUN, introduced the Stop Tax-
payer Funding of Hamas Act, which 
says that no funds will be authorized 
for the territory of Gaza until the 
President certifies to Congress that 
these funds can be spent without bene-
fitting terrorist organizations. 
The 
Stop 
Taxpayer 
Funding 
of 
Hamas Act also ensures U.S. funds are 
not authorized for expenditure in the 
territory of Gaza to any United Na-
tions entity or office that the Presi-
dent cannot certify is not encouraging 
or teaching anti-Israel and anti-Se-
mitic ideas and propaganda. 
Recently, a European Union report 
was released showing Palestinian Au-
thority textbooks in U.N.-supported 
schools 
encourage 
violence 
against 
Israelis, including anti-Semitic mes-
sages. And just last week, a tunnel re-
portedly dug by Hamas was found un-
derneath a Gaza school run by the U.N. 
agency for Palestinian refugees. 
We can’t allow this to continue. I am 
proud to lead my colleagues in saying 
the United States will not fund this de-
struction. 
I yield to my colleague from Iowa, 
Senator JONI ERNST. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I 
thank Senator SCOTT, and I appreciate 
the time to speak today on this topic. 
Certainly, I am rising to also support 
the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas 
Act. 
The United States should no longer 
provide any recognition or resources to 
Hamas, a terrorist organization sup-
plied by Iran disguised as a Palestinian 
political party. Hamas is a long-
standing terrorist organization whose 
attacks 
and 
efforts 
against 
peace 
threaten the lives of civilians and inno-
cents. 
Using the population of Gaza as a 
human shield, Hamas fired more than 
1,500 rockets into Israeli civilian areas 
in an unprovoked attack last month. 
The attack was not the action of a re-
sponsible political party but the vio-
lent outburst of an Iranian proxy bent 
on the destruction of Israel and peace. 
Hamas’s roots and rationale have 
very little to do with a broader strug-
gle for freedom of worship or narrow 
land use disagreements. It is far sim-
pler than that. Iran supplies rockets, 
and Hamas launches rockets on inno-
cent Israelis because they share a com-
mon goal: eradication of the Jewish 
people in Israel. It is that simple. 
Hamas couldn’t be more clear in 
their goals. Their charter states: 
There is no solution for the Palestinian 
question except through Jihad. There is no 
way out except by concentrating all powers 
and energies to face this Nazi, vicious Tatar 
invasion. 
No mention of peace or advancement 
for people—Israel’s defensive actions 
against a terror group that compares 
their people to Nazis and is dedicated 
to their destruction are to be expected. 
Self-defense and protection of citizens 
is a core responsibility of every coun-
try. Hamas attacked innocent civil-
ians, fully expecting them to be at-
tacked in return. Their plan was to 
purposely create civilian casualties. 
We must be unequivocal in support 
for our ally. The President and Sec-
retary of State must remain strong in 
American support to Israel and not 
lose sight of the true threat Hamas’s 
backer, Iran, poses to Israel. 
The administration must abandon its 
attempts to return to the deeply flawed 
nuclear agreement with Iran. Their at-
tempt to return to the failed nuclear 
deal only emboldens Iran’s nuclear am-
bitions. 
Iran provides Hamas and other geno-
cidal terrorist organizations with rock-
et systems, rocket parts, assembly 
training, and cash support every year. 
And Iran’s goal mirrors that of Hamas: 
to wipe Israel off the map, bottom line. 
Just as no country—Israel or other-
wise—would tolerate such terrorism 
and aggression against its citizens, no 
true ally would turn their backs on a 
friend in their moment of need. They 
certainly would not continue funding 
the organization responsible for the at-
tack. So now, more than ever, the 
United States must stand with its ally, 
condemn the attacks against Israel by 
Hamas, and affirm our commitment to 
support Israel’s peace and security. 
The Stop American Taxpayer Fund-
ing of Hamas Act ensures no funding 
will be authorized to the territory of 
Gaza, the site of Hamas’s headquarters, 
until the President certifies to Con-
gress that these funds can be spent 
without benefiting terrorist organiza-
tions. 
The United States must be clear in 
our unwavering commitment to our 
ally and ensure no American taxpayer 
dollar goes to Hamas ever again. 
I would like to thank my friend and 
colleague from the great State of Flor-
ida for moving on this piece of legisla-
tion I am proud to support. 
Again, thank you for your leadership 
on this. 
I yield the floor back to the Senator 
from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. And I yield to 
my colleague from Mississippi, Senator 
HYDE-SMITH. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I join my colleagues today in de-
fense of our longtime friend and trust-
ed ally, Israel, and to argue that abso-
lutely no American taxpayer dollars 
should be spent to benefit terrorist or-
ganizations. 
Israel has no greater friend than the 
United States, and the Israeli people 
have long relied on assistance from the 
American people and other allies. It is 
an unshakeable bond based on mutual 
respect, shared democratic values, and 
common interests that existed long be-
fore the modern State of Israel was 
founded. We must continue to support 
and foster that relationship with ev-
erything we have as Israel faces grow-
ing threats from Hamas and other ter-
rorist groups in the region. 
As the annual appropriations process 
moves along, I am concerned, as are 
many of my colleagues, that foreign 
aid—U.S. taxpayer dollars—could end 
up in the hands of those who have bold-
ly proclaimed that their intent is to do 
harm to Israel and our interests in the 
region. 
The most recent wave of violence in 
the Middle East makes it clear that 
our resources must be responsibly 
spent and kept out of the coffers of ter-
rorist organizations and bad actors 
whose violence can be bankrolled by 
commandeering U.S. foreign aid. 
The Biden administration admitted 
recently ‘‘there are no guarantees’’ our 
humanitarian assistance will reach the 
intended recipients. I believe it is our 
duty to guarantee this. It is imperative 
that we are certain that not a single 
cent of taxpayer money is spent to 
fund Hamas and its military arsenal. 
In this effort, my colleagues and I 
have teamed up to ensure that safe-
guards are in place to make sure anti- 
American and anti-Israel groups do not 
continue down this dangerous path of 
radicalization and indoctrination at 
the expense of hard-working Ameri-
cans. 
The 
Stop 
Taxpayer 
Funding 
of 
Hamas Act, introduced by my friend 
Senator SCOTT of Florida, is common-
sense legislation. It protects American 
assets and allies, while ensuring that 
not a penny of foreign aid is spent in-
doctrinating 
students 
abroad 
and 
bankrolling terrorist activities. 
This is a nonpartisan issue. Ameri-
cans do not support terrorism, so they 
certainly should not have to subsidize 
terrorism. We must take a stand 
against this barbarism and the harm it 
poses to most innocent civilians. 
I simply cannot imagine why any of 
my colleagues—Republican, Democrat, 
or Independent—would oppose legisla-
tion that is fiscally responsible, mor-
ally sound, and in the best interest of 
our allies, servicemembers, and our fu-
ture generations. 
Finally, I believe we should recognize 
that American citizens feel the painful 
effects from the recent flareup of vio-
lence toward Israel. In tandem with the 
global unrest, we have witnessed the 
significant rise in anti-Semitic attacks 
largely fueled by old prejudices and ac-
celerated by harmful political rhetoric. 
It is my fervent hope that we would 
dedicate ourselves to stopping anti-Se-
mitic violence, to fortifying our deter-
mination to protect the State of Israel, 
and to promoting peaceful relations in 
the Middle East. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to thank my colleagues 
from Iowa and Mississippi for sup-
porting me today in our effort to make 
sure that we do not ever fund Hamas. 
I hope every single Member in this 
body can agree that the United States 
shouldn’t fund terrorists with Amer-
ican taxpayer dollars—funding that 
could be used to kill Israelis—like I do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4576 
June 16, 2021 
I look forward to my colleagues joining 
me today to stand with Israel and 
against terrorism. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Foreign Relations Committee be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 1899 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, I have 
real concerns my colleagues’ efforts to 
subvert the legislative process and 
push through a bill without due consid-
eration from the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. I know my distin-
guished colleague from Florida is very 
interested in these issues. I hope he 
would ask his leadership to put him on 
the committee because he consistently 
comes to the floor and wants to cir-
cumvent the committee. This is not 
the first time. 
Let me be very clear: Hamas is a ter-
rorist organization, and the terrorists 
who lead Hamas have no regard for 
human life, whether they be the life of 
innocent Israelis targeted by their 
rocket attacks or the Palestinian fami-
lies they constantly put in harm’s way. 
Israel has every right and responsi-
bility to defend herself from attacks 
against their civilians, and the United 
States does not, and will not, ever pro-
vide funding to Hamas. Neither of 
those statements are up for debate. In 
fact, I would argue that every single 
Member of this body agrees with those 
assertions. 
Indeed, the Senate has a long history 
of carefully crafting foreign aid pro-
grams with robust oversight, as well as 
sanctions that target Hamas and its 
supporters. With that in mind, there is 
simply no reason this bill can’t go 
through regular order and sustain a 
markup in the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. I looked at the dates of intro-
duction and then its subsequent refer-
rals—less than 3 weeks. We have done 
it before, and we can do it again. 
As the chair of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
I 
prioritize moving serious, bipartisan 
legislation. This bill in question is not 
a serious attempt at legislating; it is a 
partisan talking point. 
Had the Senator from Florida, who is 
the chair of the Republican Senatorial 
Campaign Committee, or any of the 
bill’s sponsors had a genuine interest 
in asserting Congress’s role in foreign 
policy and the hard work that goes 
into legislating, they would have gone 
through the regular order of the com-
mittee process. They did not. 
Instead, I imagine they would rather 
relish in a tweet proclaiming that 
Democrats support taxpayer funding of 
Hamas or oppose defending Israel. And 
all I can say to this is, enough abusing 
the United States-Israel relationship 
for partisan political purposes. It does 
damage to the United States. It does 
damage to the State of Israel. 
I am proud of my legislative efforts 
to defend Israel for over three decades, 
and I would argue that the facts that 
these efforts have been bipartisan 
speak to the strength of the United 
States-Israel relationship. Both Repub-
licans and Democrats share a long 
track record of working together to de-
fend Israel’s right to exist and legis-
lating accountability for U.S. taxpayer 
dollars spent overseas. But we have to 
do the work, and I do believe there are 
Senators who are genuinely interested 
in working toward that goal. 
The truth is, we already have a num-
ber of laws and regulations in place re-
garding the delivery of lifesaving hu-
manitarian relief. As written, this bill, 
by way of example why we have bills go 
through the committee so they can be 
worked on, seems intended to ensure 
that nobody in Gaza could ever receive 
any of this support. The language is 
written so broadly that, for example, 
before delivering clean water or water 
infrastructure, the President would ef-
fectively have to certify that anyone 
related to Hamas would never drink 
that water or drink from a water foun-
tain that carried that water. That is 
simply absurd. 
I would welcome a robust discussion 
on the ways we can continue to ensure 
that taxpayer dollars intended for life-
saving humanitarian relief in Gaza and 
elsewhere can get to those who need it 
the most and certainly evade and avoid 
the hands of Hamas. 
Let’s remember why we invest in for-
eign aid programs in the first place. We 
do so in pursuit of our common human-
ity, of our values, and our own security 
interests. So let’s recognize the polit-
ical games being played on the floor 
today for what they are and reject 
them. 
Because of all of those reasons, 
Madam President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I am glad my colleague has ac-
knowledged his interest in helping 
Israel. Unfortunately, I am surprised 
that the—if my colleague had an inter-
est, why didn’t the Foreign Relations 
Committee take up the same resolu-
tion that the majority leader retook up 
in support of Israel basically saying 
that Israel had the right to defend 
itself and saying that Hamas was a ter-
rorist 
organization? 
My 
colleague 
didn’t. 
This is a pretty simple bill. It basi-
cally just says, look, any foreign aid 
we are going to give to the Palestinian 
Authority, we are going to make sure 
it doesn’t go to Hamas. It is pretty 
simple. 
Let’s remember why we are doing 
this. President Biden’s State Depart-
ment said: 
We’re going to be working in partnership 
with the United Nations and the Palestinian 
Authority to kind of channel aid there in a 
manner that does its best to go to the people 
of Gaza. 
That should scare us. 
It went on to say: 
As we have seen in life, as we all know in 
life, there are no guarantees, but we’re going 
to do everything that we can to ensure that 
this assistance reaches the people who need 
it the most. 
That is not much of a guarantee. 
That is a ‘‘maybe we will try.’’ We can 
do better. The Senate should do better. 
Republicans and Democrats should all 
say that not a dime will ever go to 
Hamas, a terrorist organization that 
kills little boys like Ido. We should all 
be disgusted with this. 
So I am very disappointed that my 
colleague uses a procedural matter to 
say he objects, but basically what he is 
saying is he will not agree that this 
money will not go to Hamas. This was 
really simple. You could read this in 
just 2 minutes. 
I am disappointed that my Demo-
cratic colleague has made this polit-
ical. It is not political. It is about, do 
we support Israel? Are we going to 
make sure that never a dime goes to 
Hamas and another little boy like Ido 
dies? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
NOMINATION OF TOMMY P. BEAUDREAU 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
the Senate will be voting tomorrow on 
the nomination of Tommy Beaudreau 
to serve as the Deputy Secretary of the 
Interior. If confirmed, he will play a 
critical role in managing our Nation’s 
public lands, our natural resources, our 
national parks, our wildlife areas, and 
the Outer Continental Shelf. He will 
oversee the management of the largest 
water supply in the West, and he will 
also oversee our Nation’s trust respon-
sibilities to American Indian Tribes 
and Alaska Natives. He will be respon-
sible for the multiple uses of our public 
lands. 
One of the most important roles that 
he will fulfill is overseeing the develop-
ment of traditional and renewable en-
ergy supplies on public lands and 
waters. 
Energy production on public lands is 
the engine of Wyoming’s economy. It 
creates good-paying jobs. It provides 
tremendous revenue for the State, and 
we use the essential services of the 
State funded by this, like public edu-
cation. 
Mr. Beaudreau has extensive experi-
ence at the Department of the Interior. 
He served in a leadership position dur-
ing the Obama administration. As an 
attorney in the private sector, he regu-
larly handled matters relating to the 
Department. He is an expert in his 
field. His qualifications are clear. It is 
also clear from his nomination hearing

that he understands America’s needs 
for an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy strat-
egy. That strategy must include coal, 
oil, natural gas, nuclear power, and re-
newables. 
I appreciated his commitment to 
working with members of the Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee. The 
Department needs to listen and col-
laborate with the people of Wyoming 
and the West. These are the States 
that rely heavily on energy production 
on our public lands. We are the States 
that power America. We are the ones 
that will be hit the hardest by Presi-
dent Biden’s punishing Executive or-
ders. 
This 
administration 
has 
un-
leashed a barrage of Executive actions 
that threaten to destroy the liveli-
hoods of oil, natural gas, and coal 
workers in the West. It is critical that 
Mr. Beaudreau keep those Americans 
at the forefront of his mind as he 
works at the Department. He can serve 
as a voice of reason in an administra-
tion that is waging a war on American 
energy workers. 
My goal is to hold Mr. Beaudreau and 
the Biden administration accountable 
to 
the 
commitments 
that 
Mr. 
Beaudreau has made to our committee, 
and I will support his nomination. 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Madam President, on another topic, I 
come to the floor today in support of 
America’s police officers. Every week-
end, I go home to Wyoming. Every 
weekend, people ask me about three 
issues: 
the 
President’s 
attacks 
on 
American energy, the crisis at our 
southern border, and the Democrats’ 
defunding the police. 
People see the headlines. They see 
the images on the news. They have 
heard about looting and rioting, the vi-
olence in Democrat-run cities. They 
are deeply concerned. 
Last year, 63 of America’s 66 largest 
cities saw increases in one or more cat-
egories of violent crimes. On average, 
homicides are up by one-third in just 1 
year. Since President Biden took of-
fice, these increases have continued in 
Democrat-run cities. In the first 3 
months of this year, homicides went up 
in 
Washington, 
DC; 
Oakland, 
CA; 
Philadelphia; Chicago; and Baltimore, 
just to name a few. It is no wonder that 
the American people tell pollsters that 
they feel less safe today than they did 
1 year ago. 
The Democratic crime surge is espe-
cially shocking because it is a reversal 
of a long-term trend. For a quarter of 
a century, crime in America had been 
going down. The violent crime rate was 
cut in half. The murder rate was also 
cut in half. It was a historic, bipartisan 
accomplishment. 
Then, in 2014, Democrats began their 
war on law enforcement officers. After 
Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, 
MO, Democrats started attacking po-
lice. Crime suddenly went up in Demo-
cratic cities. In the final 2 years of the 
Obama-Biden administration, the mur-
der rate went up by one-fifth. Violent 
crime overall went up by nearly 7 per-
cent. 
Then Republicans took back the 
White House and the Congress. We 
stopped the war on law enforcement, 
and crime went down again. 
Last year, Democrats began a repeat 
of 2014. This time, it was on a much 
larger scale. Democrats began attack-
ing police again. Crime went up again 
in Democrat-run cities. America’s cit-
ies saw the largest increase in murder 
on record. 
My Democratic colleagues might say 
it is a coincidence. Yet there is a very 
clear chain of events: Democrats at-
tack police. They cut police funding. 
The number of police officers went 
down. Crime went up. 
We had a chance to fix the problem in 
law enforcement. Senator TIM SCOTT 
introduced a police reform bill, which I 
strongly support. Yet the Democrats 
blocked it. Time and again, Democrats 
put criminals ahead of police and law- 
abiding citizens. Innocent people con-
tinue to pay the price. 
Democrats spend trillions and tril-
lions of our tax dollars. Yet they cut 
funding to police, to law enforcement. 
Last year alone, Democrats cut more 
than $1 billion worth of police funding. 
This includes cutting funding in cities 
where violent crime went up. 
Police have been retiring or quitting 
in historic numbers. Fewer police offi-
cers means more crime, more destruc-
tion, and more fear in our cities. 
The American people deserve better. 
The American people deserve safety 
and peace of mind. It is time for the 
Democrats to stop attacking the po-
lice. It is time for the Democrats to 
stop wasting taxpayer dollars on lib-
eral spending. It is time for Democrats 
to start paying attention to public 
safety. 
I say to my Democratic colleagues, 
the vast majority of police officers in 
this country are heroes. They put their 
lives on the line for us every day. It is 
time to treat them with respect. 
When Democrats wage their war on 
the men and women who dedicate their 
lives to law enforcement, only crimi-
nals win. The rest of our Nation loses. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to once again call for this 
entire body to have the opportunity to 
consider and cast their votes on the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act. This com-
monsense reform would ensure that 
people in the military who have been 
subjected to sexual assault and other 
serious crimes get the justice they de-
serve. 
I have been calling for a full vote on 
the floor on this bill since May 24. That 
was 23 days ago. Since then, an esti-
mated 1,288 servicemembers will have 
been raped or sexually assaulted. Two 
in three of the survivors will not even 
report it because they know they are 
more likely to face retaliation than to 
receive justice. 
Today I want to share the story of 
the kind of offender our bill would ad-
dress. 
On March 30 of this year, SSG Ran-
dall Hughes pled guilty to a series of 
rapes dating back to 2006 that he com-
mitted while the Army looked the 
other way. Staff Sergeant Hughes was 
only brought to justice after his brave 
daughter decided to come forward. Had 
the Army prosecuted him the first time 
one of his victims had come forward, 
his daughter may have been spared. 
At a Super Bowl party in 2017, Staff 
Sergeant Hughes fed drinks to his host, 
a soldier under his care, until the host 
passed out. He then approached his 
host’s wife while she was outside the 
house. He propositioned her for sex, 
and when she refused, he forced himself 
on her against their grill outside their 
house and then dragged her inside their 
house, where he raped her—all while 
the husband was passed out in the next 
room. 
The survivor hid in her bathroom 
until she could report the ordeal to CID 
the next day. CID took a year to inves-
tigate a relatively straightforward rape 
allegation. The command did nothing 
to expedite the investigation or hold 
CID’s feet to the fire. 
CID determined that the allegations 
were credible, but the command did 
nothing. Instead of prosecuting him, 
the 
command 
put 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Hughes on the sergeant first class pro-
motion list. 
Hopeless, the survivor asked that 
something, anything, be done. The 
command reacted by putting an admin-
istrative remark in his record. 
Staff Sergeant Hughes was trans-
ferred to a new duty station, Fort Dix. 
While at Fort Dix, after years of sexual 
abuse, his daughter bravely came for-
ward to report that abuse. CID at Fort 
Dix then noticed the administrative re-
mark in his record from the previous 
rape and began making inquiries. They 
learned he had raped two other women 
and physically abused his wife. 
The command had every tool avail-
able to stop Staff Sergeant Hughes 
from his serial rapes, including the 
abuse of his own daughter, but instead 
they turned a blind eye and did noth-
ing. Even after he admitted to his 
crime and pled guilty, the Army of-
fered a plea deal of 13 years of confine-
ment—13 years of confinement despite 
sexually assaulting three women, in-
cluding a minor. This serial offender 
avoided justice for 15 years. Even when 
the command was forced to administer 
justice, he received a sentence less 
than we would give a drug offender. 
This case is why we need a profes-
sional military justice system worthy 
of the sacrifices the men and women in 
our military make every day. Having 
leadership at the top that truly cares 
and that is truly passionate about pros-
ecuting sexual abuse will have reper-
cussions down the chain. Our bill does 
exactly this. 
We have 66 Senators who have co-
sponsored this bill. It deserves a vote 
on the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4578 
June 16, 2021 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1520 and the Senate 
proceed to its consideration; that there 
be 2 hours of debate equally divided in 
the usual form; and that upon the use 
or yielding back of that time, the Sen-
ate vote on the bill with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, once 
again, I object to the request from the 
Senator from New York for the reasons 
I have previously stated, and I will re-
peat again what I have said publicly 
and what I have committed to. 
I support removing prosecution of 
sexual assault, the types of crimes that 
Senator GILLIBRAND
discussed, from 
the chain of command. But her bill 
goes further to include crimes not re-
lated to sexual assault. The removal of 
sexual assault crimes from the chain of 
command will be an historic change in 
the military justice system and one 
which Senator GILLIBRAND can claim 
great responsibility for effecting. We 
must take care, however, that we do it 
thoughtfully, in a manner that does 
not break the military justice system. 
The worst thing we can do to victims 
of sexual assault is to move a bill 
through that can’t be implemented ef-
fectively or on time, creates too large 
a workload for too few qualified mili-
tary judge advocates, imperils prosecu-
tions, leads to convictions being over-
turned on appeal, or results in ne-
glected cases because the necessary at-
tention cannot be devoted to them. 
According to the Department of De-
fense, the number of full-time colonels, 
lawyer disposition authorities required 
to execute the system as proposed, 
which would take effect 180 days from 
enactment, exceeds the number of 
judge advocates in that senior grade. 
And this doesn’t account for her bill’s 
requirement that these O–6 judge advo-
cates have significant trial and crimi-
nal law experience or that they would 
not then be available for other impor-
tant assignments reserved for O–6s, 
such as military judges and division, 
corps, or combatant command judge 
advocates. 
The heads of the service Judge Advo-
cate General’s Corps have previously 
raised concerns about the implementa-
tion timeline, the resources necessary 
to execute, and a host of other incon-
sistencies with the current system that 
would have to be addressed to be sure 
of successful implementation. These 
are the very military lawyers that Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND’s bill would empower 
to make prosecutorial decisions, which 
includes an evaluation of a far greater 
number of cases than simply those that 
end up in court-martial. These are the 
issues that we need discuss in the com-
mittee and not dispose of in an amend-
ment on the floor. The committee will 
do this and do it faithfully. And I am 
very confident that we will be able to 
move legislation that does remove any 
crimes related to sexual misconduct 
from the current command to a system 
that Senator GILLIBRAND is proposing. 
With that, I would reiterate my ob-
jection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. As you heard 
from the chairman of the committee, 
he only intends on taking one crime 
out of the chain of command, and that 
is sexual assault. And the reason why 
that is so problematic is, No. 1, it will 
continue to undermine women in the 
military, marginalize them and isolate 
them, creating a ‘‘pink court’’ that all 
legal experts have agreed would be 
highly ineffective and would harm the 
military justice system. 
Second, our allies have already made 
this move. They have taken all serious 
crimes out of the chain of command 
and given it to trained military pros-
ecutors in the UK, Israel, Germany, 
Netherlands, and Australia. In those 
instances, they did it specifically for 
defendants’ rights. And we have a simi-
lar problem in this country because 
right now we have a great deal of racial 
bias in who gets punished. 
If you are Black or Brown in the U.S. 
military today, you are 2.5 times more 
likely to be punished. And most com-
manders are White commanders. There 
is further data that shows most Black 
and Brown servicemembers have either 
experienced or witnessed racism within 
the ranks. 
If we want to fix this criminal justice 
system, you need a bright line, and it 
should be at all serious crimes. That is 
how we fix the military justice system. 
That is how we give justice to sexual 
assault survivors. 
And for the chairman to say today 
that it would cost too much money or 
that they don’t have sufficient re-
sources or sufficient lawyers, it isn’t 
true. And those are the same argu-
ments that were used over the last 8 
years about excluding sexual assault 
from the chain of command as well. 
So I don’t think these are legitimate 
arguments. I think they are brought up 
year after year as just a way to put an 
impediment in front of the reform that 
is needed to fix the system. 
I now yield the floor to my colleague 
Senator GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Senator 
GILLI-
BRAND, as 1 of the 65 other cosponsors 
of this legislation, I think you are to 
be commended for every day coming to 
the floor, to be as consistent in being 
for this legislation as you have been 
since 2013. And every one of us thank 
you for your persistence. You need to 
be congratulated. And all the people 
who have been harmed by sexual as-
saults over the last decades owe you a 
great deal of gratitude for that. 
So I am here to join Senator GILLI-
BRAND in asking for a vote on this cru-
cial legislation. And, obviously, today 
we aren’t going to get it, but eventu-
ally it is going to happen. You can’t 
say no to 66 Senators that want this 
legislation. The Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act has that many bipartisan cospon-
sors, and it is past time for this bill to 
become law. 
This legislation was first introduced 
by Senator GILLIBRAND
and me and 
other Senators 8 years ago and has 
gained more and more support each 
year. Senators who previously were 
skeptical have come around and real-
ized that the Department of Defense 
can’t handle the pervasive problems of 
sexual assault on their own. 
The Armed Services Committee and 
the Department of Defense have had 
more than enough time to consider this 
idea. They have told us that they have 
it under control and tried other ap-
proaches. Those approaches have not 
worked. Women and men in the mili-
tary continue to face high rates of sex-
ual assault and retaliation. It is clear 
this bill is needed. 
By moving the decision to prosecute 
out of the chain of command, perpetra-
tors of sexual assault and other serious 
crimes will be held accountable. Sur-
vivors will have more confidence in the 
process. Retaliation will be less likely. 
We have been waiting almost a decade. 
There is no need any longer to wait. I 
urge my colleagues to allow this bill to 
move forward today. And, obviously, it 
isn’t going to move forward today, but 
Senator GILLIBRAND will be back here 
tomorrow, asking the same thing. And 
I applaud you for doing that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UTAH 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, 100 years 
ago, in 1921, a young and newly married 
couple 
named 
Percy 
and 
Verabel 
Knudson saw the need for a gathering 
place in their community. Knowing 
they could make money selling ice 
cream and candy, they started Idle Isle 
Ice Cream and Candy Store. 
A few years later, after raising the 
necessary funds, Percy and Verabel 
Knudson—with the help of David H. 
Call and his wife LaRita—shifted their 
business from sweets to full-service 
meals, and Idle Isle Cafe was born. 
Over the course of the last century, 
Idle Isle Cafe has endured remarkable 
events in history and served important 
people. It survived the difficulties of 
the Great Depression and World War II, 
all while serving locals and national 
celebrities alike, including Wallace 
Beery, Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable, 
Carole Lombard, and Paulette God-
dard. 
During the fifties, Idle Isle even 
served ‘‘The Duke’’ himself, Mr. John 
Wayne, who stopped in on a number of 
occasions while visiting Utah on hunt-
ing trips and movie shoots. 
In those years, the cafe also served as 
a meeting place for members of the 
Brigham City unit of the Utah Na-
tional Guard, who were later called to

serve their country in the Korean war. 
Idle Isle Cafe has endured both good 
times and bad over the last century. 
But whatever the times, it has always 
been a place where people from every 
walk of life could share a meal, enjoy 
friendship, and bear one another’s bur-
dens as they endured the ups and downs 
of life together. 
As the cafe celebrates its 100-year an-
niversary this year, it is worth recog-
nizing all the good that it has done for 
Utah and for Brigham City. Of course, 
bearing one another’s burdens is one of 
the things that Utahns do best. 
Travis and Jana Porter, the current 
owners of Idle Isle Cafe, epitomized 
this spirit. Everyone who befriends or 
works with the Porters quickly sees 
their love of community and their 
dedication to their country. Nearly ev-
erything they do, both inside of the 
restaurant and outside, stems from 
their passion for helping others and 
their optimistic outlook on life. 
Even with their five kids and the 
business of running the restaurant, the 
couple finds intentional time each day 
to love and serve those who work in 
the cafe and all who come to visit. As 
a result of their service, Idle Isle Cafe 
endures. 
We, as Utahns, are engaged in the 
work of enduring together. In fact, the 
State’s economy is so robust, in large 
part, because neighbors care for neigh-
bors, friends care for friends, and 
strangers even look out for strangers. 
It doesn’t matter who you are. In Utah, 
you belong. Whether in the cafe or the 
community, there is a place for you at 
the table. Our doors are open. So, too, 
are our hearts. You see, Utah is one of 
these places where it doesn’t matter 
how long your family has been in the 
State or whether you have been here 
for 5 minutes; to us, you are a Utahn. 
The endearing spirit of Utah is not 
inspired by government. No, it is in-
spired by moms and dads, teachers, 
small business owners, friends, and 
neighbors. 
Earlier this year, when neighbors in 
West Valley City were overwhelmed at 
the prospect of revamping and reclaim-
ing their community, an opportunity 
presented itself. Aging homes, with 
peeling paint and cracked up drive-
ways, broken fences, and neglected 
yards, needed to be refinished. So in 
typical Utah fashion, neighbors came 
together. 
After identifying problems, reviewing 
resources, and communicating with 
community leaders, an initiative was 
born—Operation My Hometown. Oper-
ation My Hometown is a neighborhood 
improvement coalition made up of resi-
dents, city workers, and volunteers 
from various churches and other orga-
nizations. It runs entirely on private 
initiative and volunteerism, two of 
Utah’s hallmark strengths. Their proc-
ess is simple: see something in need of 
repair, note it and join the group to 
help fix it and then, of course, fix it. 
Repair requests can be submitted on-
line, and anyone can help. The projects 
are significant. And, quite remarkably, 
they are being completed. To quote one 
news report: 
Six days a week, the church is converting 
its meetinghouse in the neighborhood into a 
community center. Corporations are donat-
ing cash and goods. A new park is planned. 
The city is adding street lights. Funds are 
being raised to finance home ownership. And 
volunteers are streaming in from all over the 
Salt Lake Valley to work side by side with 
residents. 
Neighborhood resident, Bonnie Shaw, 
stated: 
I am so encouraged, so hopeful, so blessed, 
I can’t even believe this is happening. 
Another resident, Nickolaus Orwin, 
shared, as follows: 
We live in a strange world these days. We 
hear this ideology that if you don’t look like 
me, talk like me, act like me and vote like 
me, then we must be enemies, but through-
out all of this social upheaval . . . this com-
munity has worked together and served one 
another in such a brilliant and beautiful way 
that it just defies the ideology that we’re dif-
ferent and we have to segregate ourselves 
out into groups. Even in the dark days of 
COVID . . . this community service was such 
a bright, shiny star. Through all of that 
hard, we have this, this really beautiful and 
safe community service that was happening. 
It has been said that ‘‘the greatness 
of a community is most accurately 
measured by the compassionate actions 
of its members.’’ If that is the case, 
then Utah is truly a great place. 
To honor this tradition of greatness, 
I myself am grateful to host the annual 
Flavors of Utah event in partnership 
with Operation My Hometown in West 
Valley City later this summer. My of-
fice has partnered with this and other 
great community groups to collect food 
from local producers and distribute it 
to those in need. I encourage other 
Utahns to join me in this effort as we 
together 
look 
for 
opportunity 
to 
thrive. 
The spirit of Utah, the enduring spir-
it of Utah, is borne from a rich history 
of hard work, industry, innovation, and 
ingenuity—even against great hard-
ship. Few individuals embody this spir-
it more than the late Obert Clark Tan-
ner. 
Born in Farmington, UT, in 1904, O.C. 
Tanner was the youngest of 10 children. 
Despite his position in the family, from 
a young age, Tanner felt an obligation 
to provide for his family. He did so by 
performing odd jobs around the city, 
including stoking furnaces. One of the 
people for whom Tanner stoked the fur-
nace was a jeweler. The jeweler became 
a friend and a mentor to Tanner and, 
with time, schooled the young Tanner 
in the jewelry business. Tanner was a 
quick study. He swiftly implemented 
the lessons taught to him and began 
selling graduation pins and class rings 
from the back of his car. 
In 1927, he officially founded the O.C. 
Tanner Company. Though still an un-
dergraduate student at the University 
of Utah, he used what little time he 
had outside of his classwork to make 
ends meet—and make ends meet, he 
did. The company quickly grew and en-
dured the difficulties that put others 
out of business. 
Throughout the years, the enduring 
spirit of O.C. Tanner has been a guiding 
light and inspiration to many, and the 
company has achieved truly great 
heights. 
In 2002, the O.C. Tanner Company 
crafted the medals for the Winter 
Olympics, which were hosted in Salt 
Lake City. In 2019, O.C. Tanner de-
signed a copper spike replica of the 
original golden spike that was ceremo-
nially driven at the joining of the two 
branches of the first transcontinental 
railroad. 
Today, the O.C. Tanner Company 
maintains offices in the United States, 
Canada, England, Singapore, Australia, 
and India. The company is one of the 
largest manufacturers of retail and 
corporate awards in the United States, 
and it employs over 1,500 people. 
Through the dark nights of hardship, 
O.C. Tanner has endured and even suc-
ceeded, thrived. Through the difficul-
ties of community building, the volun-
teers of Operation MyHometown en-
dure, and they are succeeding. 
Through 100 years of historic highs 
and unforgettable lows, the Idle Isle 
Cafe endures and, yes, the cafe is suc-
ceeding too. As goes the saying, those 
who endure conquer. 
Similar to O.C. Tanner, volunteers of 
Operation MyHometown, the Idle Isle 
Cafe, and all Utahns have endured the 
difficulties of the last year with ut-
most faith and fortitude, and they are 
emerging 
victorious. 
The 
enduring 
spirit of Utah is strong. 
The 
2020 
pandemic, 
earthquakes, 
civic discord, confusion, and conten-
tion presented daunting challenges in 
the lives of all, and yet Utahns are 
breathing a collective sigh of relief as 
we embrace the shining horizon that 
lies yet ahead. 
Since the onset of the virus over a 
year ago, Utahns have seen near-con-
tinual drop in unemployment. Utah’s 
unemployment rate fell to 2.8 percent 
in April—less than half the national 
number. 
Though earthquakes shook homes 
and businesses last year, Utah’s econ-
omy has still been rated the best in the 
United States by several nationally 
recognized outlets. And while the dis-
cord, confusion, and contention seem 
to dominate the airwaves, Utah’s citi-
zens have banded together to bridge 
the partisan divides that can be so dif-
ficult to overcome. 
Utah and Utahns are remarkable. 
If you are seeking a place to start a 
business, ask those at Idle Isle Cafe. 
Utah is the place. 
If you are seeking a place where com-
munity matters, ask those at Oper-
ation MyHometown. Utah is the place. 
If you are seeking a place where op-
portunity is abundant, read the story 
of O.C. Tanner. Utah is the place. 
I am very grateful for the privilege of 
representing the State of Utah here in 
the U.S. Senate. It is my hope that the 
successes and the enduring spirit of

June 16, 2021 
Utah will continue to serve as an ex-
ample for the Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). The Senator from Texas. 
JUNETEENTH 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day, the Senate moved a historic bill 
one step closer to President Biden’s 
desk. The Senate unanimously passed 
legislation to finally make Juneteenth 
a Federal holiday and to preserve the 
legacy of that momentous day for gen-
erations to come. 
For more than a century, Texans 
have celebrated Juneteenth and com-
memorated the anniversary of the day 
slaves in Texas were first informed of 
the news that they were, indeed, free. 
President Lincoln issued the Emanci-
pation Proclamation on January 1, 
1863, but the news didn’t reach Texas 
for 21⁄2 years, until June 19, 1865. 
We were the first State to make 
Juneteenth a holiday and, of course, it 
commemorates an event that occurred 
in Galveston, TX. But over the last 
four decades, many other States have 
joined us. 
It 
is 
finally 
time 
to 
recognize 
Juneteenth as a national holiday. I re-
introduced this bipartisan bill with the 
Senator from Massachusetts, Senator 
MARKEY, this year, and I have been 
proud to work alongside my fellow 
Texan Congresswoman, SHEILA JACK-
SON LEE, in the House to get the bill 
passed and signed into law. The bill 
now heads to the House and according 
to Congressman STENY
HOYER, the 
House will actually pass it today. 
I will have more to say about the his-
tory and significance of Juneteenth to-
morrow, but for now, I want to thank 
the dozens of Senators on both sides of 
the aisle who have supported this ef-
fort. I think, particularly now at this 
point in our Nation’s history, a little 
reconciliation can go a long way. 
It is also an opportunity to learn 
from our past. America is the greatest 
Nation in the world, but we are not 
perfect and, indeed, the original sin of 
slavery when this country was created 
has caused this country a lot of angst, 
death, and injustice over the years. We 
fought a civil war, and 600,000 Ameri-
cans died. If you extrapolated that to 
current population, that would be like 
3 million Americans dying. 
Of course, we went through the civil 
rights movement in the sixties, and, of 
course, the latest manifestation of ra-
cial strife is the unfortunate killing of 
people like George Floyd and the lack 
of trust that exists between some law 
enforcement and the communities that 
they serve. 
While America is not perfect, we con-
tinue to do the work to strive to be ‘‘a 
more perfect Union,’’ in the words of 
the Constitution. 
IRAN 
Mr. President, this Friday, Iran will 
hold its 13th Presidential election, but 
unlike Presidential elections in the 
United States or in any other legiti-
mate democracy, this process in Iran is 
more about providing the appearance 
of a democracy than an actual demo-
cratic process. 
In America, elections are conduits 
for change. If the American people 
don’t like their elected officials or the 
direction of their government, they can 
change it. In Iran, elections are a 
sham. The candidates are hand se-
lected, the result predetermined, and 
the 
opportunity 
for 
change 
non-
existent. 
The process for electing the Presi-
dent of Iran is just a few steps shy of 
the fabricated elections in places like 
Iraq under Saddam Hussein. In 2002, 
Saddam won reelection by 11 million 
votes—11 million to 0—and there was 
reported to be 100 percent turnout. In 
fact, there weren’t any other can-
didates running. In fact, the question 
on the ballot asked if Saddam should 
remain in office, check yes or no. 
It reminds me of the story I heard 
about that time of a reporter traveling 
with a driver whom he had hired to 
drive him around Iraq to report on con-
ditions there. The reporter asked— 
when he learned that there was 100-per-
cent turnout and Saddam Hussein won 
by 100 percent of the votes, he said to 
this driver: Well, you have been with 
me; how did you vote? And he said: 
Saddam must have known what was in 
my heart. 
That, to me, is maybe apocryphal, 
but a demonstration how even the dic-
tators like Saddam Hussein, even the 
Ayatollah in Iran, still want to give 
the appearance of democracy, even 
though they deny it to their very own 
people. 
In Iran, the situation isn’t much dif-
ferent than the election under Saddam 
Hussein. It is just a larger effort to cre-
ate the appearance of choices. 
While the Iranian people may vote 
for the eventual winner, there is a 
highly controlled process that selects 
the pool of candidates, and the pup-
peteer behind the curtain is the Su-
preme Leader, Ali Khamenei. 
Unlike a true democracy, the can-
didates for President of Iran are not se-
lected by the Iranian people. They are 
selected behind closed doors by a pow-
erful group called the Guardian Coun-
cil. This group, itself, is comprised of 
12 people. Half are selected by the Su-
preme Leader and the other half are se-
lected by the Parliament. 
But Parliament can’t select just any-
one for this position. These six jurists 
are chosen from the options presented 
to the Parliament by the Chief Justice, 
and the Chief Justice—you might have 
guessed—is appointed by the Supreme 
Leader. 
This contrived election is not the re-
sult of a fair and democratic process. 
So the candidates hardly represent the 
will of the Iranian people. Of the 592 
registered candidates, only 7 were ap-
proved by the Guardian Council—5 con-
servatives and 2 so-called reformists. 
The Guardian Council, in fact, pre-
vented most reformists or moderate 
candidates from even participating in 
the race, and the candidate pool was 
carefully whittled down to a point that 
the outcome is virtually a known cer-
tainty. 
All signs point to the eventual win-
ner being Ebrahim Raisi, the favorite 
of the Supreme Leader and the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is easy 
to see why Mr. Raisi is the chosen 
front man for the corrupt leaders of a 
brutal regime, because his resume is 
nothing less than a long list of atroc-
ities. Mr. Raisi’s first step to power 
came after the 1979 Revolution. 
Throughout the 1980s, he gained more 
power and influence and the trust of 
the Ayatollah. In 1988, he was chosen to 
be one of the four members of the so- 
called ‘‘death commission’’ charged 
with carrying out executions of Ira-
nians’ political prisoners. Mr. Raisi 
played a central role in these execu-
tions, which took place over the course 
of 5 months. 
It is difficult for us to be sure how 
many political prisoners were killed, 
but it is widely known to be in the 
thousands. Some believe the death toll 
could be as high as 30,000 from these 
death commissions. 
Mr. Raisi’s reign of terror did not 
stop there. He continued to serve in 
high-ranking positions throughout the 
government and inflict violence on dis-
sidents. He currently serves as the Ju-
diciary Chief, where he continues to di-
rect the execution of protesters and 
ethnic minority groups. Once again, 
this mass murderer is expected to be 
the next President of Iran. 
This election comes at a very precar-
ious time for the regime. Iran has expe-
rienced major uprisings since the last 
election in 2017. Popular slogans in-
cluded: ‘‘Death to the dictator’’ and 
‘‘Our enemy is right here; they lie 
when they say it is America.’’ 
Iranian citizens place the responsi-
bility for the economic crisis that the 
country is currently experiencing on 
the regime that controls the country. 
The vast majority of Iranians live 
below the poverty line, and the govern-
ment’s pathetic mishandling of COVID– 
19 
has 
made 
already 
harsh 
cir-
cumstances even more unbearable. 
The Iranian people know this elec-
tion is a sham. Candidates approved by 
the Supreme Leader offer no window 
for the freedoms and change that they 
desperately want and desperately need. 
The Iranian resistance has called for 
an all-out boycott of the elections, and 
turnout is expected to be the lowest 
since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
For the United States and our allies, 
this changing of the guard cannot be 
just a blip on the radar, because Iran 
continues to commit human rights 
abuses and back terrorist organizations 
and authoritarian figures, including 
dictators around the world. 
Currently, two Iranian warships are 
making their way across the Atlantic, 
and we have reason to believe that 
these 
ships 
are 
carrying 
missile- 
equipped fast-attack boats and other 
military equipment to Venezuela.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 16, 2021 
Whether this is a test or a threat or 
an effort to seek some kind of leverage 
remains to be seen, but what is abun-
dantly clear is that Iran has no inten-
tion of taking its foot off the gas. 
Over the past 2 months, U.S. military 
assets in Iraq have been attacked by 
drones laden with explosives, and all 
signs point to the responsibility being 
on Iranian-backed militias. Just last 
month, the world watched in horror as 
the conflict between Israel and Pal-
estine gave way to more violence and 
destruction than we have seen in years. 
This was a proxy war waged by Iran 
against the Jewish State. Hamas—that 
proxy—receives 
significant 
financial 
support from Iran, which is the No. 1 
state sponsor of terrorism in the world. 
Now take these actions over the past 
few months, and add that to what we 
have seen over the last several years. 
Iran has arrested and continues to de-
tain American citizens. It engages in 
gross human rights abuses. It backs 
terrorists around the world. We have 
also watched as Iran has blatantly ig-
nored the restrictions on the Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action, the so- 
called JCPOA, which is designed to pre-
vent Iran from enriching uranium and 
building a nuclear weapon. 
During the time that it violated the 
terms of the JCPOA, Iran was led by 
President Hassan Rouhani, broadly 
considered to be a moderate when com-
pared to his expected successor. Fol-
lowing this election, Iran’s already ex-
treme President will be replaced by an 
even 
more 
punishing 
leader. 
The 
United States cannot simply stand by 
and enable Iran to continue down its 
current path. 
In recent years, Iran has felt signifi-
cant pressure from the United States 
and our allies. The Trump administra-
tion withdrew from the Iran nuclear 
deal and placed sanctions on hundreds 
of 
businesses 
and 
individuals 
who 
helped finance Iran’s illicit activities, 
and there is no question that Iran 
stood the most to lose from the his-
toric Abraham peace accords that were 
brokered this last year. This took a 
number of Arab countries that were 
nominally adversaries, and they joined 
together to declare their willingness to 
let Israel live in peace and to recognize 
it as a legitimate state. 
The Biden administration has al-
ready loosened the pressure valve on 
Iran. President Biden has made it clear 
his intent to revive the Iranian nuclear 
deal no matter what the cost. At the 
same time, the administration has 
rolled back sanctions that would have 
provided the U.S. maximum leverage 
to bring Iran to the negotiating table. 
By simply signaling his intent, the 
Biden 
administration 
has 
already 
emboldened and encouraged Iran’s ma-
lign activities. Iran did not play by the 
rules of the JCPOA the first time 
around, so there is absolutely no rea-
son to believe that this will change 
when a radical mass murderer assumes 
the Presidency. 
Over the last few days, the leaders of 
the G7 have reaffirmed the need to stop 
Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. 
I agree that this is one of the most 
critical responsibilities of our time, 
but a flawed agreement that relieves 
pressure on Iran, without concessions, 
with regard to its nuclear weapon aspi-
ration will only continue to embolden 
the regime. Iran’s belligerence cannot 
be rewarded with sanctions relief, and 
the administration should not continue 
to squander our leverage. 
The Biden administration needs to 
resume the maximum pressure cam-
paign on Iran, and I would encourage 
the President to work closely with us 
in Congress to identify an approach 
that is effective, comprehensive, and 
built on bipartisan foundations. We 
have to stop Iran from ever achieving a 
nuclear weapons capability. 
I asked the Director of National In-
telligence, Avril Haines, during her 
confirmation 
hearing: 
Should 
the 
United States prevent Iran from get-
ting a nuclear weapon? She said: Yes. 
She didn’t hesitate. 
I asked Ambassador Burns, the new 
CIA 
Director, 
the 
same 
question: 
Should we let Iran get a nuclear weap-
on? He said ‘‘no’’ without hesitation. 
I find that encouraging from these 
two new members of President Biden’s 
Cabinet, but we need to work together, 
as Republicans and Democrats, as 
Members of Congress, with the admin-
istration to ensure that our efforts to 
stop Iran from developing nuclear 
weapons can last beyond the term of a 
single President or Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here to talk about the escalating crisis 
on our southern border. 
I am the ranking Republican, the 
senior Republican, on the Homeland 
Security Committee, which is a com-
mittee that has, among other things, 
oversight over what happens at the De-
partment of Homeland Security and 
therefore at the border and with the 
Customs and Border Patrol and has 
other responsibilities. We have been 
looking at this issue carefully over the 
past few months. We have been trying 
to figure out how we can address this 
surge at the border that is really over-
whelming the Border Patrol. 
It is obviously about people, but it is 
also about drugs. Unfortunately, there 
are more and more drugs coming over 
the southern border as well, which, in 
effect, makes States like mine, Ohio— 
which is not on the southern border; we 
are actually on the northern border— 
part of the border, in effect, because we 
are affected by what happens down 
there. 
At one time, most of the most deadly 
drug, fentanyl, which is a synthetic 
opioid, was coming from China. Frank-
ly, a lot of it was coming from the mail 
system, from our own Postal Service. 
We passed legislation here in this body. 
I have worked with Republicans and 
Democrats alike on it, and we have 
largely been able to deal with that 
issue, but those same drugs have now 
moved to Mexico, and now they are 
coming across our southern border. So, 
if you look at the amount of fentanyl 
and other synthetic opioids—again, the 
deadliest of all drugs at a time when 
more people are dying from overdoses 
in our country than ever in history— 
more and more of that is coming across 
the southern border in addition to the 
cocaine and crystal meth and other 
dangerous drugs that were already 
coming. 
This is about the immigration sys-
tem not working properly and having a 
huge 
surge 
of 
individuals—family 
members, unaccompanied kids. It is 
also about not having control of that 
border and having this contraband 
come over—in the case of these dan-
gerous drugs—that is actually result-
ing in overdoses and deaths all over the 
United States, including in my State of 
Ohio. 
So how can we tell that it is getting 
worse? I would just look at these num-
bers here. This is the latest from the 
Customs and Border Protection folks of 
its encounters at the southwest border. 
Remember, we had a crisis in May of 
2019, which was deemed to be the worst 
crisis of its kind, and it was pretty bad. 
We had a lot of unaccompanied kids 
coming at that time and a lot of family 
members as well as individuals. The 
high point was here at 144,000 individ-
uals. We are now, as of May of 2021, 
which was last month, at 180,000. 
Some of my colleagues have said: 
Well, it is getting better. I don’t see 
that it is getting better, and the num-
bers don’t say it is getting better. It is 
really at the point now where it is 
overwhelming those people whose jobs 
are to try to control the border. They 
just don’t have the resources to be able 
to handle this. 
It is also overwhelming our system 
all the way through. A lot of this is of 
families and kids coming in, as an ex-
ample, and we don’t have the facilities 
to take care of these children. 
During this first period of time—here 
is the Biden inauguration. After the in-
auguration, this huge increase started 
to happen, and it was because policies 
were changed. A new President who is 
coming in has the right to change poli-
cies, but in my view, what a President 
doesn’t have the right to do is to 
change policies without preparing for 
it. 
It is one thing to say we are not 
going to have an emergency on the 
southern border anymore and that we 
are going to do away with title 42—a 
provision that says, if you have some-
body coming over the border during 
COVID, he can be turned back—and im-
mediately the President is saying: No,

June 16, 2021 
we are not going to use that anymore 
for unaccompanied kids. They have 
also now not used it for most families 
coming over. So not having title 42 was 
a shock to the system. You had a situa-
tion where people were being turned 
away because of COVID one day, and 
the next day, they were not, and you 
can see the result. 
By the way, these are people who 
come from all over the world, but a lot 
come from the Northern Triangle coun-
tries—the countries of Guatemala, El 
Salvador, and Honduras. 
Recently, the President of Honduras 
talked about this, and I know the 
President of Guatemala has talked 
about it. What the President of Guate-
mala has said, in essence, is that the 
traffickers, the smugglers, heard this. 
So they came down to our country and 
said: Let’s go to the northern border 
and make that difficult and arduous 
journey—it is sometimes a very dan-
gerous journey for these children—be-
cause the Biden administration has 
said that there would no longer be this 
title 42 in place so that we can turn 
you away at the border. In fact, he 
said: We want to reunite families and 
kids, and that means come to the bor-
der, and you can come into the coun-
try. That is what has happened. 
Look, I believe we ought to have a 
legal immigration system that is very 
healthy in this country. I believe in 
immigration. I think it is a very im-
portant part of who we are as Ameri-
cans. We take more people in legally 
every year than any other country in 
the world, and that is over a million 
people a year. I think that has been 
good for our country. It is part of the 
fabric of our society. We should want 
immigrants to come but to come in a 
legal and orderly way. 
And not only is this surge over-
whelming the border, but it is really 
not fair to all of those people who have 
been waiting in line for years and years 
to come to our country from a country 
like El Salvador or Honduras or Guate-
mala or Mexico, for that matter, people 
who want to come legally, people who 
are reuniting with their families le-
gally here or have skills that we want 
in this country. We should encourage 
that. But this is happening in a way 
that is not orderly, and it is happening 
because there has been a change in pol-
icy. 
The other big change in policy is that 
if you come, people were told—this is 
after the inauguration—then if you 
apply for asylum, meaning that you 
have a credible fear of persecution 
back home, so you apply for asylum, 
you will be allowed to come into the 
country. In other words, there won’t be 
an adjudication of that. There won’t be 
a decision made. Whether you apply 
properly or not, you will be told you 
can come into the country. 
So I went down to the border a cou-
ple months ago and was able to go 
there with Secretary Mayorkas and my 
colleague on the committee, Senator 
PETERS, who is the Democratic chair-
man of the committee, so it was a bi-
partisan group, and at that point, we 
were just overwhelmed with these chil-
dren. At that point, the Border Patrol 
stations and the border detention fa-
cilities, which were primarily built, 
frankly, for single adults and were 
never built for long-term detention, 
were overwhelmed with children. You 
had children sleeping side by side dur-
ing COVID—none of them being tested 
for COVID, by the way—and they didn’t 
have blankets. They had sheets, essen-
tially, that are—you know, no real 
warmth or padding. They were sleeping 
on the ground with pads underneath 
them. The system just couldn’t handle 
it. 
Now, at this point, most of those 
children are out of the Border Patrol 
system, and they are into the HHS sys-
tem. HHS is the Agency that is sup-
posed to take care of these kids. They 
can only be in the Border Patrol cus-
tody for a short period of time. That 
was being violated. They were staying 
there much longer than they were sup-
posed to under law, but there was no 
place else for them to go. So now there 
have been HHS facilities that have 
been built and opened, and these HHS 
facilities are taking care of these kids. 
I will say that some of my colleagues 
would say: Well, this is great news. 
You know, we have fewer children in 
Border Patrol custody; that is good. 
But they are still in American Govern-
ment custody; they just switched from 
Border Patrol to HHS. 
HHS has had a very hard time staff-
ing up, and there have been, as you 
know, allegations of abuse. Some of 
these contracts that have been given to 
the private sector to run these HHS fa-
cilities have not been done in a proper 
way, and it has caused problems. 
A lot of the people who were down 
there on the border helping with these 
kids do not have the right training. 
They are not trained to take care of 
kids—including, by the way, a lot of 
government employees who have vol-
unteered to go down. God bless them. 
They are getting paid to go down there 
rather than do their work here in 
Washington, as an example, but they 
don’t have the training. 
So this creates a lot of issues, as you 
can imagine, when you have thousands 
and thousands of these kids showing up 
in unprecedented numbers. So that is 
what we are seeing on the border be-
cause of changes in policy. 
Another change in policy that was 
made was not only were we no longer 
going to turn people away because of 
COVID without putting anything in its 
place to deal with all these claims, but, 
instead, there was a policy called the 
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy or the Mi-
grant Protocol policy. Under that pol-
icy, people who came as families and 
applied for asylum were told: Fine, but 
you have to wait in Mexico rather than 
wait in the United States for your asy-
lum claim to be adjudicated. 
Frankly, a lot of those people ended 
up going back home because they were 
not brought into the United States, 
into the interior, as I said earlier, as 
the vast majority of people have been. 
They were instead told: You have got 
to wait in Mexico. They chose instead 
to go back to their home, mostly in 
Central America, rather than wait in 
Mexico. Those cases, once adjudicated, 
those people could come back and 
enter into our country if they were 
successful in their court case. 
But this system is not working. If a 
trafficker or a smuggler goes to a fam-
ily in Central America or elsewhere— 
there are a lot of immigrants now com-
ing from other countries, including all 
over Latin America, Ecuador, and 
Nicaragua and other places. They say: 
Look, if you come with us, give me a 
lot of money as a trafficker, thousands 
of dollars, and if these kids come with 
me or you come with me as a family, 
we will get you into America, and you 
will have the opportunity to stay in 
America. 
You know what, I have to say tonight 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate that 
those smugglers and traffickers are 
probably telling the truth, and that is 
the problem, because when they come 
to the border and they claim asylum, 
then instead of having that be adju-
dicated there at the border and deter-
mined—or saying: You need to wait on 
the other side of the border until we 
adjudicate this—what I would do on 
our side of the border, I would do the 
adjudications right there rapidly. In-
stead, they are saying: OK. Here is a 
bus pass or here is a plane ticket. Go to 
the interior of the United States. Go to 
your hometown, wherever it is, who-
ever is listening tonight—my home-
town is Cincinnati, OH—go to Wash-
ington, DC, wherever, and then wait for 
your court case. You need to check in 
periodically. 
Those court cases and the adjudica-
tions take years—on average, 4, 5, 6, 7 
or 8 years, depending on who you talk 
to. Because a lot of these cases are ap-
pealed, that is maybe where you get to 
the 7 or 8 years. So that is a long pe-
riod of time, right, when you are in the 
United States awaiting your court 
case. Why? Because there is a back-
log—a huge backlog—of over a million 
cases. I think it is more like 1.3 million 
now. So that huge backlog and the lack 
of resources that have been devoted to 
the system and the fact that just be-
cause you apply for asylum, you get to 
come into the United States gives the 
trafficker the ability to say that, to 
say: Just let your kids come with me 
or come with me as a family member. 
Pay me a lot of money. 
Unfortunately, a lot of these individ-
uals, including kids, women and girls, 
get abused on the trip north from 
mostly, again, the Northern Triangle 
countries—Guatemala, 
El 
Salvador, 
and Honduras up to Mexico. Obviously 
there are a lot of issues with crossing 
the border itself in terms of going 
across the desert, and there are some 
terrible stories. 
But the point is, they know that 
when they get to the United States,

they are going to be told not that ‘‘You 
have to turn back,’’ not that ‘‘You 
have to stay here until we decide 
whether you actually are, you know, 
going to get asylum, whether you qual-
ify for it,’’ but instead ‘‘Here is a bus 
ticket. Here is a plane ticket. Go into 
the interior and wait.’’ 
Now, let’s say that individual who 
goes to the interior does not show up 
for the court case. What happens? Well, 
in theory, there is a group called ICE, 
which is part of the immigration sys-
tem that then, having kept track of 
that person, deports the person back to 
their home country. That is not hap-
pening, or at least it is not happening 
in the vast majority of cases. 
For a while, it was that the adminis-
tration—and, frankly, the previous ad-
ministration had a similar policy for at 
least some time—that we are going to 
focus on criminals. So those who are in 
the United States who are migrants 
coming up here who have a criminal 
record, we are going to deport them 
but not prioritize others who simply 
come here under an asylum claim and 
then do not show up at their court case 
or show up but do not leave the coun-
try. 
But if you look at the deportation 
figures over the last several months of 
the Biden administration, you will see 
that that is just simply not happening. 
In fact, there were fewer deportations 
last month, I am told, than there are 
ICE agents. So I am not sure what they 
are doing. 
But I do know that on this day, on 
the inaugural day, President Biden said 
to the world that we are going to stop 
deportations for a period of time. So 
that is added to this narrative that if 
you are a smuggler or a trafficker and 
one of these people who are taking ad-
vantage and exploiting these families 
and individuals and kids, you have got 
a narrative that is pretty strong where 
you can say: Hey, if you go to the bor-
der and you claim asylum, you come 
into the United States of America, and 
then we will see what happens. Unfor-
tunately, right now we don’t have a 
system in place to deal with that. 
So that is a long way of saying we 
have a crisis on the border, and we are 
not facing up to it. 
In a number of the hearings that I 
have been at on this topic, the adminis-
tration witnesses go out of their way to 
say this is the fault of the Trump ad-
ministration. Their argument is, as I 
understand it, that the Trump adminis-
tration should have been prepared for 
this surge by putting in place during 
this time period a lot more of this in-
frastructure. 
We talked about the HHS facilities, 
for instance, that were not ready, and 
therefore kids got stuck at the Border 
Patrol detention facilities. 
Well, it is an interesting argument. I 
mean, they didn’t have any issue here. 
They didn’t have this surge. They did 
back in 2019, but they put policies in 
place to deal with it. You can argue 
whether those policies were right or 
not, but you can’t then say: OK. They 
should have had all this infrastructure 
in place. 
My point is, we need to own up to our 
own actions, and to blame the Trump 
administration for what is happening 
now in terms of the lack of infrastruc-
ture when the infrastructure wasn’t 
needed, frankly, given the policies they 
had in place, I think is, frankly, just 
not a very constructive use of time. We 
should instead be focused on, OK, how 
do we take this situation and make it 
better and deal with it? 
My own view, for what it is worth, is 
we start with enforcing the law, par-
ticularly along the border, and say to 
our Border Patrol: We are going to give 
you the support you need to be able to 
support keeping these drugs out and 
dealing with the immigration crisis in 
an appropriate way. Instead, we have 
done just the opposite. 
So the first thing I would do is to 
say: Let’s support those who are on the 
border. Let’s tell them we are going to 
be there for them and provide them the 
resources they need to do their job. 
One of those things, of course, is to 
complete the fencing that was started 
during the Trump administration. 
There are some in this body on the 
other side of the aisle and, of course, a 
lot in the Obama administration who 
did not support the wall; same with the 
new Trump administration—or, I am 
sorry, the new Biden administration. 
But the Trump administration decided 
to go ahead with the wall. They got the 
money for it. He started building it— 
not across the whole border but over 
about 20 percent of the border, which 
has often been misunderstood, but 
areas where it would make a dif-
ference, at least to slow people down. 
I have always been of the view that 
the wall is not in and of itself an an-
swer because if you don’t have tech-
nology associated with the wall, people 
will go under it or over it and around 
it. You have to have the cameras and 
the sensors and so on to make the wall 
effective. That has not been completed. 
What has been completed is most of 
the fencing, but then there are gaps in 
the fencing. And when I was down 
there, as everyone can testify who has 
been down to the border to see this, 
there are literally holes in the wall 
where they were going to put a gate in, 
but they hadn’t completed it yet, and 
when the Biden administration came 
in, again, one of the things they did on 
day one, they said: Stop. Stop the con-
struction—even though the contractors 
had already been paid to do this work. 
So, literally, if you go to the El Paso 
sector, where I was, you go to an open-
ing in the wall, there will be the con-
struction material there on the ground, 
and there are no contractors there, and 
the Border Patrol, you can imagine, is 
demoralized by this. These people have 
already been paid to put up the gate, 
but they leave the gate open. So they 
have to be 24/7 physically present there 
to keep people from coming through 
those openings or just—which is what 
they do because they don’t have the 
people to do it—just assume you are 
going to have a lot of crossings there 
when there is not Border Patrol there. 
Instead, we should complete those 
very small sections of the wall that 
haven’t been completed, and, again, it 
is mostly openings. 
Then we should put the technology in 
place. We were told when we were down 
in El Paso in that sector that only 10 
percent of the technology had been put 
in place for, let’s say, you know, dozens 
of miles of wall—not thousands, not for 
even the area outside of the suburban 
and urban areas, but in the areas where 
it could slow people down to give the 
Border Patrol a chance to be able to re-
spond. But the technology was stopped, 
again, on day one because President 
Biden said we are going to stop con-
struction, stop—even though the con-
tractors had been paid for this work. 
So that, to me, is No. 1. Let’s give 
the Border Patrol what they need in 
terms of personnel and equipment and 
specifically the technology. I think the 
technology is the most important part 
of this. And you do need the sensors, 
you do need the cameras, and you do 
need to know what is going on. 
If smugglers are coming through 
with a bunch of drugs and they can di-
vert the Border Patrol, which they do, 
with another group—let’s say a group 
of unaccompanied children or families, 
where there is a lot of processing time 
involved—the Border Patrol will go to 
the one group, spend a lot of time proc-
essing, as they have to do, and in the 
meantime, the group coming with the 
drugs will sneak across. If you have the 
technology in place, you can avoid 
that, but if you don’t, there is no way 
to deal with that crisis. 
So, No. 1, let’s take care of those 
along the border who are trying their 
best to do their work and don’t have 
the support that they need. 
No. 2, I think we need to reinstate 
some asylum policies that were start-
ing to work effectively. Frankly, they 
hadn’t been implemented fully during 
the Trump administration, so it is hard 
to tell. But one is allowing people who 
want to apply for asylum to apply in 
their home country or in a safe third 
country. 
So think about this. I talked ear-
lier—people who want to apply for asy-
lum now are just coming to the border, 
and they are told, under an asylum 
claim, they can go into the interior of 
the United States. They are given 
maybe a notice to appear—actually, a 
lot of families are not even given a no-
tice to appear anymore because they 
are just overwhelmed. We saw that, 
and I saw families who were literally 
given just a sheet of paper that had the 
addresses of where the ICE offices are 
in America, and they were told: We 
don’t know where you are going in 
America, but wherever you go, go to 
this ICE office wherever, in your re-

But whether they are given a notice to

interior.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4584 
June 16, 2021 
Instead, what if those people ap-
plied—not taking that dangerous jour-
ney north through Mexico but instead 
applied in their home country or ap-
plied in a safe third country? 
And there were safe third-country 
agreements with the countries in the 
region—for 
instance, 
Guatemala— 
which, as you know, those who are in 
Guatemala are coming from El Sal-
vador or Honduras or farther south. 
That makes a lot of sense to me. Those 
are discontinued for some reason. They 
really hadn’t been put in place where 
they were implemented fully, but that 
would seem to me to be a very smart 
thing; that is, to tell people: If you 
want to apply for asylum, that is fine. 
Come to our consulate office and apply, 
or if you don’t want to apply in your 
own country, perhaps because you do 
fear persecution, go to a third country 
and stay in a third country and apply. 
Doesn’t that make sense? 
Also, I think we should—and again, 
these should all be bipartisan ideas— 
give the Border Patrol the resources 
that they need. On third-country asy-
lum applications, I know for a while 
there were a number of Democrats who 
strongly supported applying for asylum 
in your own home country. President 
Obama’s administration did for some 
time. 
But, third, I would require adjudica-
tion at the border. So when you come 
for asylum—and this is consistent with 
legislation that is bipartisan that Sen-
ator SINEMA and Senator CORNYN intro-
duced and I support—you have regional 
processing centers on the border. This 
will take some funds. It will be expen-
sive because we don’t have a system in 
place right now. As I said, there is a 
1.2, 1.3 million backlog in asylum 
claims. That is when people have to 
wait 4, 5, 6, 7, years. Instead, have these 
on the border. Have these operations 
where somebody can come, claim asy-
lum, and go before an immigration offi-
cial, someone who can judge whether 
that asylum claim is credible or not. 
A little background for this, if you 
come from these Northern Triangle 
countries or come from Mexico and 
claim asylum, only about 15 percent— 
that is 1–5, 15 percent—of these asylum 
claims are ultimately successful. Why? 
Because most people who are coming 
are 
coming 
for 
economic 
reasons, 
which I totally understand. If I were a 
father in Honduras in a rural area and 
I had no prospects for a job, I would 
want to gather up my family and come 
to the United States, because you can 
get a lot more financial security here 
for yourself and your family. That is 
totally understandable, but that is not 
the basis for an immigration system 
because, unfortunately, there are bil-
lions of people around the world in that 
kind of a situation. So it needs to be 
based on an orderly system where, yes, 
people can apply, as they do every day 
from Honduras and come through the 
legal immigration system, or if they 
have a credible fear, they can apply for 
asylum. But why not do it in these safe 
third countries or, when you come up 
to the border, do it at the border? 
Again, let’s assume 15 percent in the 
end qualify. Those 15 percent would be 
able to come in as asylees, much as ref-
ugees come into this country. It is ba-
sically the same criteria. I am not 
against the refugee system. I think we 
should accept refugees in this country, 
as other countries do, who have a cred-
ible fear of persecution in their own 
country and need a place to land. We 
have a successful system to do that. We 
have a system to resettle these people. 
There are agencies that specialize in 
that. A lot of them are private sector 
agencies. 
So I think on the border is where we 
ought to put the funding. These re-
gional processing centers ought to be 
there to help make the decision quick-
ly—quickly—so that people don’t have 
to wait 4 years, but instead they get an 
answer, yes or no, to be able to come 
into this country if they apply for asy-
lum and they qualify for asylum. 
Finally, I would say that we need to 
put a system in place to discourage il-
legal immigration that goes to the em-
ployer. And I know this is somewhat 
controversial on both sides of the aisle 
for different reasons, but to me, if an 
employer can hire someone who is ille-
gal, because that person has docu-
mentation—say, a driver’s license or 
Social Security card or something else 
that is fraudulent—there will be more 
and more illegal immigration because 
that is the magnet. 
I know some say that people come to 
this country to take advantage of our 
social services and not to work. There 
may be some of that, but I will tell 
you, if you go to the border and talk to 
these migrants—which I have done, and 
I did it again a couple of months ago 
and did it many times before—and ask 
them: Why are you coming to America? 
They are not saying they are coming to 
America to get on our social welfare 
system. They say they are coming to 
work because they know they can 
make 5 times, 10 times, maybe even 
from poor areas in Honduras 15 times 
what they can make in their own coun-
try. And they would like to bring their 
families and would like for them to 
have a better life and maybe send re-
mittances back to their family. Well, 
again, that is an issue that we need to 
address in these third world countries, 
but in the meantime we need to have 
an orderly system of immigration, and 
if you allow employers to hire people 
without any consequence, then, this 
will continue to happen. 
So what is the answer to that? Well, 
one is to have an E-Verify system that 
really works. That means you have to 
verify electronically whether someone 
is eligible to work in the United 
States. And the small business owner 
should not be the police officer. It 
should be easy to do. It should be a 
software system that enables them to 
find out immediately whether that So-
cial Security card is fraudulent or not. 
That includes looking at the Social Se-
curity number online and deciding: Is 
this number connected to this person? 
It also, I think, is going to have to 
require a photograph and looking at 
the 
photograph 
and 
determining 
whether the person is who the person 
says he or she is. But this can be done 
with the new technologies that we 
have. Right now we have E-Verify in 
place, but it is not mandatory. Don’t 
you think it should be mandatory? Be-
cause if you dry up the job opportuni-
ties for people coming illegally, then 
you will not have this magnet of pull-
ing people over the border. 
Again, legal immigration ought to be 
encouraged. We ought to bring in refu-
gees. Asylees who qualify ought to be 
given asylum in this country. That is 
who we are. We are a country that has 
always welcomed the stranger. But do 
it in an orderly and lawful way. 
If we don’t do that, we will continue 
to see a border being overwhelmed. We 
will continue to see this. There is no 
reason for this to change based upon 
current policy. These simple steps that 
I talk about could all be bipartisan. 
This is not a partisan issue. This is an 
issue of commonsense approaches that 
have been taken by Republican and 
Democrat administrations over the 
years. We can make a big difference 
here. 
There is a small program called the 
Central American Minors Program, 
which was reinstated just this week, 
and it helps with regard to unaccom-
panied 
kids 
coming 
from 
Central 
America. I support that program. I am 
glad the Biden administration put it in 
place, and I have been told by Biden ad-
ministration officials at the highest 
level at DHS that this is the answer. 
Well, we had something like 19,000 kids 
coming over the border in one month, 
and thousands a day. In that system in 
the Obama years, when it was in place, 
the Central American Minors Program 
only had 3,000 or 4,000 kids come 
through it over 10 weeks, or something 
like that. So we had more children 
coming over in 2 days than they did in 
that entire program. 
I am not suggesting that the program 
is a bad idea. Let’s do that. But if you 
don’t do these other things, too, you 
are not going to make a dent in this 
issue. 
And, again, our hearts go out to some 
of these individuals. They have a tough 
time in their countries, and we wish 
their countries were more like ours. We 
wish that they had more economic op-
portunities, more freedom, and that 
they had a democracy and a market 
system that actually works for the 
people. That is not the reality now. 
I know the administration is focused 
on saying the answer to this question 
is dealing with the push-backers, deal-
ing with, as Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS said during her trip, the source 
of the problem, which is the poverty in 
Central America. Well, I will say, No. 1, 
there are migrants coming from all 
over the world, from Central America, 
of course—and that continues, and that

S4585 
June 16, 2021 
is a very poor part of our hemisphere— 
but also from many other countries, in-
cluding Mexico, including people from 
Romania, from Yemen. I am just look-
ing here—from Ecuador, from Colom-
bia, from countries all over Latin 
America. So it is a big problem. 
Again, there are billions of people in 
the world who unfortunately don’t 
have the kind of lifestyle that we have 
in this country and aspire to it. So you 
have to have an immigration system of 
some kind. 
Second, I would make the point that 
the administration is talking about 
spending $4 billion in Central America. 
I suppose that is over the next few 
years. It should be noted that we just 
spent $3.6 billion on economic develop-
ment in those same countries over the 
past 5 years. 
So I am for that. I think we should be 
helping these countries develop. I was 
for a trade agreement with these coun-
tries to try to encourage their eco-
nomic development. 
I am for helping to deal with the cor-
ruption and dealing with the kind of 
lack of transparency and lack of oppor-
tunity in these countries. That is all 
good. The judicial system and the rule 
of law need to be strengthened—no 
question about it. I am for doing that. 
These countries are in our hemi-
sphere. They should be treated, in my 
view, differently than even countries 
elsewhere in the world because they 
are close to us. They are our neighbors, 
essentially. But that is not going to 
solve the problem—certainly, not dur-
ing my lifetime. It will take decades, 
and it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do it. 
And we have been doing it. Some $3.6 
billion of hard-earned taxpayer money 
has gone toward this in the last 5 
years. 
But I don’t think it is honest to tell 
the American people: If we just spend a 
little more money in Central America, 
this problem will be solved. 
Wouldn’t that be nice, if we could 
wave a magic wand and it could be 
solved and suddenly those countries 
would be prosperous and free? 
It is going to take a long time. It 
doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be 
doing it, but in the meantime we have 
to come up with a system that is law-
ful, that is orderly, that is humane, 
and that deals with this problem. And 
by putting our heads in the sand or 
blaming the previous administration— 
again, here is their record—that is not 
going to solve the problem. In fact, it 
is going to create an impression that 
the problem is easy to solve, which it is 
not. It is a difficult problem—no ques-
tion about it. And broader immigration 
reform is something that is needed—no 
question about that. 
But, in the meantime, let’s focus on 
the border. Let’s do these simple 
things. Let’s support the Border Pa-
trol. Let’s be sure that they have what 
they need in terms of technology. Let’s 
be sure that we are doing all we can to 
have asylees apply in their country, or, 
if not, in a third country. If they come 
to our border, let’s adjudicate those 
claims at the border, because then the 
next group will say: Well, I am not 
going to get to come into the United 
States and wait for 4 or 5 years and get 
embedded in the community. I am 
going to have to have my case decided 
at the border. 
It is much more likely that those 
traffickers, those smugglers who are 
exploiting these people are not going to 
be able to say—again, with some credi-
bility right now: Hey, you come with 
me. You pay me a lot of money. I will 
take you not just to the border, but 
you will get into America, and you will 
be able to have a life there because you 
won’t be deported. 
That is what they can say now. We 
want them instead to be saying: Well 
you are going to have to have your 
case adjudicated at the border, and you 
may be qualified. 
Again, 15 percent have made it 
through, and those are people who 
should be taken care of, in my view, as 
asylees. But for those other individ-
uals, they will know that it is much 
better to apply legally, to go through 
the system, and to have the oppor-
tunity to go through an orderly, legal 
process. 
So I hope that the administration 
makes some of these changes quickly 
because I don’t see this situation get-
ting any better. In fact, in May it got 
worse, despite everyone saying from 
DHS, with whom I spoke: Don’t worry. 
Things are getting better. 
I don’t see that. There is a looming 
date—I think it is the end of July— 
when title 42 will no longer apply to 
single individuals. Right now, title 42, 
which I talked about earlier, which is 
where, because of COVID, the United 
States government is turning people 
away at the border. Right now, this is 
happening with regard to single indi-
viduals. When title 42 ends, which it 
will at the end of what is the COVID– 
19 public health emergency, which ex-
pires soon, then what is going to hap-
pen? 
Well, I can tell you, the Border Pa-
trol is very, very nervous about that. 
That is one question they ask me re-
peatedly: What are we going to do 
when we can’t use title 42 and when 
people know that, when they come into 
this country, they are not likely to get 
deported? 
That is a short-term issue we have to 
deal with. Congress could extend title 
42 for now. We still have a COVID 
issue, not just in this country. Thank 
goodness we are getting over it, but it 
is a much bigger issue, unfortunately, 
south of the border, in all of these 
countries we talked about, including 
some of these countries in South Amer-
ica that are having a serious issue 
right now with COVID. You could con-
tinue with it, in my view, as a public 
health emergency. But, in any case, 
let’s not do this—get rid of, as an ex-
ample, title 42 without preparing for it. 
Let’s be sure there is in place some-
thing else, something better to be able 
to deal with the obvious surge that we 
have seen. 
So I appreciate the fact that this is a 
tough issue, and I know that some of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle would probably prefer that we not 
get into these difficult issues because 
they are hard. 
I do see that the Presiding Officer 
has now arrived, with whom I have 
worked quite a bit on this issue, and we 
have a specific piece of legislation that 
helps to deal with this issue, that helps 
to deal with the surge. 
That legislation is bipartisan. It cre-
ates a strategic plan and a contingency 
fund for immediate needs at the border 
when there is a surge to deal with the 
DHS issue I talked about earlier when 
the Border Patrol just gets over-
whelmed. 
That is another part of what we 
ought to do, is to be honest about the 
problem and to deal with it. It is called 
the Border Response Resilience Act, 
and it enables the Department of 
Homeland Security to respond to the 
worst immigration crisis that we have 
had in at least 20 years. I would hope 
that—again, that is a bipartisan ap-
proach—that we could at least pass 
that and then take the other four steps 
that I talked about to ensure that we 
have an orderly system that actually 
works and to be sure we can retain the 
sovereignty of our border, keeping the 
list of drugs out, like synthetic opioids 
and like fentanyl, that are killing so 
many Americans, and that we have an 
orderly and lawful and humane immi-
gration system. 
With that, I yield back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING JIM BUNNING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 57 
years ago on Father’s Day, 1964, future 
U.S. Senator from Kentucky Jim Bun-
ning pitched the perfect game—the sev-
enth in Major League Baseball his-
tory—for a 6–0 win by the Philadelphia 
Phillies over the New York Mets. Jim 
would have been 90 years old this sum-
mer, and in recognition of his leg-
endary career in baseball and politics, 
the Behringer-Crawford Museum in 
Covington, Kentucky is celebrating his 
life with an exhibit running from this 
Father’s Day until August. Today, I 
recognize Senator Jim Bunning as an 
outstanding Kentuckian and a lifelong 
champion on both the pitcher’s mound 
and the Senate floor. 
It is fitting that Jim would be hon-
ored at the Behringer-Crawford Mu-
seum, which has celebrated everything 
great about northern Kentucky for 
over 70 years. The exhibit, entitled 
‘‘From the Mound to the Hill,’’ encap-
sulates the essence of Jim’s life as an 
all-around Kentucky hero. It is rare 
that leaders are able to excel in one, 
let alone two, fields, but Jim earned 
acclaim with grit, determination, and 
tenacity. 
After his prodigious, 17-year baseball 
career with the Tigers and the Phillies, 
which included 224 wins and 2,855 
strikeouts, 
Jim 
returned 
home 
to 
Campbell County to serve at all levels 
of local, State, and national govern-
ment. He dedicated his life to the peo-
ple of Kentucky, and our gratitude for 
his public service is apparent in trib-
utes like the one at the Behringer- 
Crawford Museum. 
I served with Jim in the Senate for 
his entire tenure and was proud to 
work alongside a man of deep convic-
tion and strongly held principles. As he 
once said, ‘‘I have been booed by 60,000 
fans in Yankee Stadium, standing 
alone on the mound, so I never cared if 
I stood alone in Congress, as long as I 
stood by my beliefs and my values.’’ 
Jim was never afraid to defend his 
ideals and fight for Kentuckians in the 
Senate, a trait his constituents whole-
heartedly admired. He truly deserves 
his place in the Hall of Fame, not just 
for baseball, but for life. 
No commemoration of Jim would be 
complete without also honoring his 
wife Mary, a truly remarkable woman 
who led her own admirable life. 
The 
Northern 
Kentucky 
Tribune 
highlighted 
the 
Behringer-Crawford 
Museum’s exhibit in a recent article. I 
ask unanimous consent that the article 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

BASEBALL 
STAR, U.S. SENATOR JIM BUNNING 
It will be 57 years to the day. Father’s Day, 
Sunday, June 21, 1964. 
That’s the day Northern Kentucky’s Jim 
Bunning, a member of the Philadelphia Phil-
lies, pitched the seventh perfect game in 
major league history—a 6–0 win over the New 
York Mets at Shea Stadium. 
It was the first perfect game in the Na-
tional League since 1880 and Bunning’s sec-
ond no-hitter. His first came as a member of 
the Detroit Tigers on July 20, 1958, against 
the Boston Red Sox. 
Behringer-Crawford Museum’s From the 
Mound to the Hill exhibit, a pictorial history 
of the baseball life of Southgate’s Jim Bun-
ning, is on display now through August. Rex 
Morgan, a life-long friend of Bunning, do-
nated the material to the museum. 
‘‘Jim Bunning was truly a local hero,’’ said 
Jason 
French, 
curator 
of 
exhibits 
at 
Behringer-Crawford Museum. ‘‘When we were 
given the opportunity to display such an ex-
tensive collection of Bunning memorabilia, 
it was less of a question of ‘if’ than ‘when.’ 
We felt that the summer of his 90th year 
would be a great way to honor his memory.’’ 
Bunning was born October 23, 1931. 
Bunning was the sole major league base-
ball athlete to be elected to both the United 
States Senate and the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame. He pitched from 1955 to 1971 for the 
Tigers, Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates and Los 
Angeles Dodgers. When he retired, he had the 
second-highest total career strikeouts in 
major league history. He currently ranks 
19th. 
A graduate of St. Xavier High School in 
Cincinnati in 1949, Bunning received a bach-
elor’s degree in economics from Xavier Uni-
versity in 1953. He was elected to the Phila-
delphia Phillies Baseball Wall of Fame in 
1984, and in 1996, to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame via the Veterans Committee. In 2001, 
his uniform number, 14, was retired by the 
Phillies. 
After retiring from baseball, Bunning re-
turned to his native Northern Kentucky and 
was elected to the Fort Thomas city council, 
then the Kentucky State Senate, in which he 
served as minority leader. In 1986, Bunning 
was elected to the United States House of 
Representatives from Kentucky’s 4th con-
gressional district and served in the House 
from 1987 to 1999. He was elected to the U.S. 
Senate in 1998 and served two terms as the 
Republican junior senator. In July 2009, he 
announced that he would not run for reelec-
tion in 2010. Bunning gave his farewell 
speech to the Senate on December 9, 2010. 
‘‘When we were approached about being a 
permanent home to a massive Jim Bunning 
memorabilia collection, there was little 
chance that we were going to turn it down,’’ 
French said. ‘‘Jim was such an icon and local 
legend. He did so much for our community 
and was always there for Behringer-Crawford 
Museum, too. Housing his collection is quite 
natural for us and exemplifies our partner-
ship with the Northern Kentucky Sports Hall 
of Fame.’’ 
Hall of Fame members will be admitted to 
BCM free on Saturday, June 19 to view the 
Mound to the Hill Jim Bunning display, as 
well as adjunct displays featuring the Negro, 
Cuban and Mexican leagues. 
Behringer-Crawford Museum opened to the 
public in 1950 as a natural history museum 
based 
on 
the 
collections 
of 
William 
Behringer, an avid collector, traveler, diarist 
and Covington resident, featuring fossils, 
minerals, animal specimen and other oddi-
ties from his world travels. It is the only mu-
seum totally dedicated to the people, his-
tory, culture and art of Northern Kentucky. 
Admission to the museum: $9 for adults, $8 
for seniors (over 60), $5 for children (3–17 
years old) and free for children under 3. 
Hours of operation are Tuesday through Sat-
urday, 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Sunday, 1 to 
3:30 p.m.

and operated a Batteries Plus Bulbs 
franchise in Bowling Green, KY. As a 
young man, David owned and operated 
a successful service station in Puryear, 
TN. After meeting his wife, Dorothy, 
David relocated to Bowling Green in 
1988. Dorothy, who was working in 
Bowling Green at the time, is a Ken-
tucky native and a graduate of Western 
Kentucky University. Over the next 
few years, David started working in the 
batteries industry. When local entre-
preneur Steve Sheldon opened a Bat-
teries Plus Bulbs franchise in 1999, 
David joined his friend as store man-
ager. In 2004, when Steve moved on 
from the company, David and Dorothy 
purchased the store. 
Today, Batteries Plus Bulbs Bowling 
Green continues to thrive under David 
and Dorothy’s leadership. In addition 
to their original location, they own 
and operate Batteries Plus Bulbs fran-
chises in Elizabethtown and Somerset, 
KY, and Clarksville, TN. David and 
Dorothy’s care and attention to detail 
are evident in every aspect of their 
business. Their strong sense of family 
has built a tight-knit and supportive 
team, with several long-time employ-
ees working over a decade at the store. 
Customers are regularly greeted by 
name and treated according to the 
golden rule. Finding a solution to a 
customer’s problem is prioritized over 
pushing a sale. Notably, Batteries Plus 
Bulbs Bowling Green is known for its

beloved mascot, Morris. A rescued cat, 
this 13-year-old orange tabby delights 
staff and visitors alike. The Bowling 
Green Area Chamber of Commerce rec-
ognized 
David’s 
outstanding 
work, 
naming him the 2016 Small Business 
Person of the Year. 
Together with his wife, Dorothy, 
David gives back to his community. 
Locally, Batteries Plus Bulbs has spon-
sored several sports teams and chari-
table 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Bowling Green/Warren County Humane 
Society. David and Dorothy are active 
within their local church community 
as well. Notably, Dorothy also served 
as executive director of the Barren 
River Area Development District and 
was involved with the Hospice of 
Southern Kentucky. 
Like many small businesses, David 
and his team stepped up to keep their 
community 
supplied 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. As an essential 
business, they stayed open and adapted 
to State guidelines, ensuring all of 
their employees stayed healthy. De-
spite the challenges, at the end of 2020, 
Batteries Plus Bulbs Bowling Green 
was ranked No. 25 out of 740 franchises 
nationwide by the national corporate 
office. 
Batteries Plus Bulbs is a notable ex-
ample of the endurance and resilience 
of 
family-owned 
businesses. 
Small 
businesses like Batteries Plus Bulbs 
form the heart of towns and cities 
across Kentucky, regularly stepping up 
to support their communities. Con-
gratulations to David, Dorothy, and 
the entire team at Batteries Plus Bulbs 
Bowling Green. I wish them the best of 
luck and look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky and beyond.∑

S. RES. 269 
At the request of Mr. DURBIN, his 
name was added as a cosponsor of S. 
Res. 269, a resolution designating June 
19, 2021, as ‘‘Juneteenth Independence 
Day’’ in recognition of June 19, 1865, 
the date on which news of the end of 
slavery reached the slaves in the 
Southwestern States. 
f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. TUBERVILLE: 
S. 2079. A bill to limit donations 
made pursuant to settlement agree-
ments to which the United States is a 
party, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
today, I want to discuss an issue that 
many folks may not be familiar with, 
but they should be. After today, they 
will be. When I first heard about this, 
I couldn’t believe it was true, but I 
have learned up here that just when 
you think you have seen or heard the 
worst, the swamp will always surprise 
you. 
One of the many important roles of 
the Department of Justice is to rep-
resent the United States in civil and 
criminal trials. Sometimes the DOJ de-
cides that a pretrial monetary settle-
ment for a lawsuit is the best route to 
take. The DOJ directs the money from 
the settlement to the victims or to the 
Treasury. That is the way our system 
is supposed to work. 
But during the Obama administra-
tion, the DOJ took a different course. 
Rather than direct settlement money 
to victims, the DOJ pushed the defend-
ants to give money instead to third- 
party organizations favored by the De-
partment. This was a slush fund for 
groups chosen by the DOJ. What is 
more, the DOJ would count the dollar 
amount of any donation as double to-
ward the settlement. Money paid to the 
victims or the Treasury would only 
count dollar for dollar. So it was a 
huge incentive for these defendants to 
pay a third party, and these third par-
ties often had nothing to do with the 
lawsuit. 
When 
companies 
like 
JPMorgan, 
Bank of America, or Citigroup had to 
pay settlements based on mortgage 
lending 
practices, 
the 
DOJ 
inten-
tionally directed millions of dollars to 
liberal activist groups. You don’t have 
to take my word for it; here is an email 
from the Office of the Associate Attor-
ney General in 2013 talking about the 
DOJ settlement with JPMorgan: 
Can you explain to Tony the best way to 
allocate some money toward an organization 
of our choosing? 
Those are the key words there: ‘‘of 
our choosing.’’ 
Let me continue to quote: We have 
been discussing having the agreement 
provide that JPM agreed to pay $9 bil-
lion but that, if, by the time we sign 
the settlement agreement, JPM has 
given $60 million to X, they will have 
to pay only 8 billion. 
I think that is OK. We understand 
that we would not have control over 
what X organization does with the 
money. 
The ‘‘Tony’’ referred to there is Tony 
West, an Associate Attorney General, 
who was at that time No. 3 in the De-
partment of Justice. 
Two days later, the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights 
wrote to the Office of the Associate At-
torney General to lobby on behalf of a 
group called VOICE. The Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
includes the biggest activist arms of 
the political left, including the ACLU, 
Planned Parenthood, Big Labor’s AFL– 
CIO, and the teachers unions. 
On No. 3 here, but when the Leader-
ship Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights contacted the DOJ, it was be-
cause VOICE wanted funds from the 
JPMorgan 
settlement. 
Not 
surpris-
ingly, VOICE ended up receiving $1 mil-
lion from JPMorgan. 
They had a listening ear in the 
Obama administration. This is what he 
wrote to Tony about the settlement 
with Citigroup. Chart 4. 
They were concerned with the possi-
bility of Citi picking a group like, 
‘‘The Pacific Legal Foundation does 
conservative property rights free legal 
services.’’ The DOJ was clear: Conserv-
ative groups couldn’t have the access 
to the same funds that liberal groups 
could. It was obvious. 
Here was the result, chart No. 5. 
From Bank of America alone, the Na-
tional Council of La Raza, now known 
as UnidosUS, received $1.5 million. The 
National Urban League received $1.2 
million. VOICE got another million 
dollars, on top of the first million. 
This won’t shock you, but both La 
Raza and the Urban League were big 
supporters of President Obama’s agen-
da. They are also both members of the 
Leadership Conference on Civil and 
Human Rights today. La Raza consist-
ently lobbied Congress to pass Presi-
dent Obama’s misguided immigration 
reform bill. Urban League was a rou-
tine cheerleader of the Obama adminis-
tration’s Big Government approach to 
public housing. They were rewarded for 
their advocacy with millions of dollars 
from the DOJ. 
In total across the Federal Govern-
ment, the money directed to third par-
ties added up to a total of $668 million, 
according to the nonpartisan Regu-
latory Transparency Project. 
On chart No. 6, out of the $668 mil-
lion, at the end of the day, they could 
only locate $9.5 million, which is 1.4 
percent of the total money given. We 
don’t even know exactly where or how 
the rest of the money was spent. 
Folks, I have one word for you on 
this. This is called corruption. This is 
the swamp. The fact that this practice 
ever existed should make Americans’ 
blood boil. Political appointees at one 
of the most powerful Departments in 
the country used their position of 
power to extract money from compa-
nies, and then they gave that money to 
their like-minded friends. That is what 
is wrong with Washington, DC. 
We have grown used to hearing about 
this type of behavior from dictator-
ships around the world, like Russia or 
Venezuela. We should not, we cannot 
accept this type of behavior here in the 
United States of America. 
Well, President Trump didn’t. His ad-
ministration, very early in his tenure, 
put a stop to this practice. They were 
right to do so. It should never have 
happened in the first place. But now, 
with a new President in office and with 
so many high-profile Obama adminis-
tration retreads throughout the admin-
istration and in the White House, this 
corrupt practice could and probably 
will return. Congress cannot allow this 
to happen. I don’t care if it is a Repub-
lican or a Democrat or an Independent 
in the White House; the power of the 
purse lies with us, the folks in this 
building. It is called the 117th U.S. 
Congress—elected officials, not bureau-
crats. 
We need a permanent fix. If the Fed-
eral Government is diverting settle-
ment funds away from victims into po-
litically connected groups, they are un-
dermining Congress’s role. There is a 
way to stop this. Earlier today, I intro-
duced 
the 
Stop 
Settlement 
Slush 
Funds Act. This bill would ensure that 
all settlement funds would go first to 
the victims and then to the Treasury— 
no third party. No administration 
should be allowed to force donations to 
politically connected groups at the di-
rect expense of victims. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this commonsense solution. 
Let’s ensure our Federal Government 
works on behalf of all of its citizens, 
not just the ones with connections to 
people in power. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, 
Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. DUCKWORTH,

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
272—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
HEALTH AND WELLNESS COACH-
ES 
Mr. HEINRICH submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 272 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention considers chronic diseases to 
be ‘‘the public health challenge of the 21st 
century’’; 
Whereas decades of research have linked 
lifestyle factors, such as inactivity, poor 
diet, tobacco smoking, and sustained stress, 
with increased risk for major illnesses and 
death; 
Whereas the costs associated with the 
treatment of many chronic diseases are high 
and often preventable; 
Whereas a health and wellness coach is a 
new type of healthcare worker who serves as 
a supportive mentor to motivate individuals 
to make positive health choices and move 
toward specific wellness goals; 
Whereas health and wellness coaches sup-
port clients in achieving good health— 
(1) based on the goals of each client; and 
(2) in a manner consistent with the treat-
ment plan recommended by a healthcare pro-
vider for the client; 
Whereas health and wellness coaches assist 
clients in making healthy lifestyle changes 
by encouraging them— 
(1) to use insight; 
(2) to use personal strengths and resources; 
(3) to set goals; 
(4) to create action steps; and 
(5) to hold themselves accountable; 
Whereas health and wellness coaches play 
a vital role in improving individual wellness 
that complements, and does not replace, the 
work of healthcare professionals; and 
Whereas an increasing number of studies 
demonstrate how health and wellness coach-
es help— 
(1) to improve individual health and 
wellness; and 
(2) to reduce healthcare costs: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports the ef-
forts of the health and wellness coaches of 
the United States in their important work to 
improve the health and wellness of the peo-
ple of the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 273—DESIG-
NATING JUNE 2021 AS ‘‘GREAT 
OUTDOORS MONTH’’ 
Mr. 
DAINES 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
PETERS, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. KING, Mr. 
CRAMER, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, and Mr. HEIN-
RICH) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 273 
Whereas hundreds of millions of individ-
uals in the United States participate in out-
door recreation annually; 
Whereas Congress enacted the Outdoor 
Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act of 
2016 (Public Law 114–249; 130 Stat. 999) to as-
sess and analyze the outdoor recreation 
economy of the United States and the effects 
attributable to the outdoor recreation econ-
omy on the overall economy of the United 
States; 
Whereas the Outdoor Recreation Satellite 
Account, updated in September 2020 by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Depart-
ment of Commerce, shows that outdoor 
recreation 
generated 
more 
than 
$788,000,000,000 in economic output in 2019, 
comprising approximately 2.1 percent of the 
current-dollar gross domestic product; 
Whereas the Outdoor Recreation Satellite 
Account shows that, in 2019, the outdoor 
recreation sector experienced faster growth 
in real gross output, compensation, and em-
ployment than the overall economy of the 
United States, while also providing 5,200,000 
jobs across the United States; 
Whereas the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2019 (Public Law 116–6; 133 Stat. 13) en-
couraged the Department of Commerce to 
continue its work with the Outdoor Recre-
ation Satellite Account; 
Whereas the Great American Outdoors Act 
provides billions of dollars over the next 5 
years to help improve infrastructure on pub-
lic lands and waters and expand access to 
outdoor recreation for all people of the 
United States; 
Whereas regular outdoor recreation is as-
sociated with economic growth, positive 
health outcomes, and better quality of life; 
Whereas many outdoor recreation busi-
nesses are small businesses, which have been 
heavily impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas outdoor recreation businesses are 
cornerstones of rural communities and out-
door recreation is part of the national herit-
age of the United States; and 
Whereas June 2021 is an appropriate month 
to designate as ‘‘Great Outdoors Month’’ to 
provide an opportunity to celebrate the im-
portance of the great outdoors: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 2021 as ‘‘Great Outdoors 
Month’’; and 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States to responsibly participate in recre-
ation activities in the great outdoors during 
June 2021 and year-round.

GO FOR BROKE STAMP 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is an 
honor to recognize the toughness and resil-
iency of the Japanese American soldiers of 
the four forty-second regimental combat team 
during World War II. Men and women who 
stepped up to fight for American prosperity 
while their families were simultaneously forced 
into confinement camps. 
This stamp, which displays their motto ‘‘Go 
For Broke,’’ honors the patriotism Japanese 
American soldiers exemplified despite the be-
trayal they faced at home. Under these 
charged circumstances, the 442nd proved 
itself as one of the most decorated unit of its 
size and length of service in the entire history 
of the U.S. Military. 
As a community with a shared, and at 
times, painful history, it is important to have a 
symbol. A national symbol of perseverance. 
Many Americans don’t know the stories of 
their own family tree . . . they likely don’t 
know the bravery of the Japanese American 
soldiers during WWII, soldiers of the 442nd 
and others, who helped save our country while 
our own government was tearing apart our 
families. 
The stamp will shine a light on this chapter 
of history. And to teach that we are all Ameri-
cans. To see the United States soldier’s face 
on the stamp, an Asian American face. 
This stamp is also the symbol of the tireless 
efforts of three wonderful women—FUSA 
Takahashi, AIKO King and CHIZ Ohira, who 
truly drove the effort to make this a reality. 
The story behind the creation of this stamp 
speaks to the dedication and strong fabric of 
the Japanese American community. This was 
a community-led effort, started over 15 years 
ago, that brought together many generations. 
I saw up close how hard it was to convince 
their fellow colleagues that this is important, to 
work with the community, to talk to their legis-
lators. 
Just earlier this month, I had the pleasure to 
see its unveiling in Sacramento and speak to 
Fusa about the importance of this community 
symbol. We all shared our stories from that 
chapter of time. 
I know that many families who were incar-
cerated did not tell their stories once they 
were allowed back home. It was painful to be 
incarcerated, to live behind barbed wire and 
lose your homes, businesses and even loved 
ones. 
We remembered when our community stood 
up and shared our painful past with Congress 
and across the country, fought for redress and 
the Civil Liberties Act. We recounted the many 
efforts of educating our neighbors and our 
children, to remind them that we are everyday 
Americans and what happened was wrong. 
And now, recently, we understand how im-
portant it is to continue to teach about our his-
tory because people are hurting, especially 
with the horrific events that have targeted the 
AAPI community. Looking at the past, one 
thing we’ve learned is that we have to stand 
up for each other. 
As we continue to strive to become a more 
tolerant nation, we must do our part in over-
coming societal wrongs, and we must also re-
member the strength of our nation when we 
come together toward a shared goal. 
The Go For Broke Stamp is a symbol of 
education, of healing, and of community. The 
Japanese American experience is a vital piece 
of American history, and in order to have a 
stronger democracy, we must lift each other 
up and tell our stories. 
I am glad that this stamp will serve as a re-
minder of the Japanese American story, and 
the bravery and patriotism of these American 
heroes.

HONORING ARMY VETERAN AND 
WOUNDED WARRIOR ALEXANDER 
LOFGREN 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of a friend, not only to my-
self, but to his colleagues and to this country. 
I rise today to honor United States Army vet-
eran, Alexander Lofgren. Alex served the vet-
eran community on behalf of my office in Ari-
zona’s Third Congressional District. Born 
March 10, 1989 in Exeter, California, he spent 
many years of his life traveling and living in 
different states as his father served in the mili-
tary. Alex followed in his father’s footsteps and 
joined the military in 2011. He served as a 
Combat Engineer in the Army and only 
months after he joined, he was deployed to 
Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. 
During his service in the Army he lost 4 
friends, who we also honor today. SFC Bobby 
L. Estle, PFC Jose O. Belmontes, 2LT David 
E. Rylander, and SPC Junot M. L. Cochilus. 
After being honorably, medically discharged 
in October 2014, Alex began his studies at Ar-
izona State University. He graduated with a 
degree in Political Science and a minor in An-
thropology. 
Shortly 
after 
graduating, 
he 
worked at the Crisis Response Network where 
he did case management answering calls of 
veterans in crisis and helping them with imme-
diate crisis intervention. He later served on 
then-Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema’s Vet-
eran’s Advisory Council and Legislative Com-
mittee. In July 2019, Alex joined our District 
office in Tucson, AZ through the Wounded 
Warrior Fellowship Program. Alex worked as a 
constituent services representative helping 
local constituents resolve issues with federal 
agencies, serving as a liaison to local Vet-
erans Service Organizations (VSO), and at-
tending local events and meetings on behalf of 
my office. 
Alex loved his plants, enjoyed nature, golf, 
greenhouses, cooking, and local coffee and 
donut shops. He was an avid photographer 
and always on an adventure that often in-
cluded enjoying time with his partner, Emily, 
and their dogs, Gunner, Jane, and Nora. Alex 
had visited over 20 national parks. He was 
passionate about using outdoor activities as a 
means of helping other veterans and em-
braced the activities and serenity nature had 
to offer. Tragically he passed away on April 4, 
2021 in a visit to Death Valley National Park. 
We find comfort in knowing that Alex spent 
his last days doing what he enjoyed alongside 
a person he loved. We have no doubt that his 
heroic actions during the hike that ended so 
tragically helped keep his partner, Emily, alive 
until search and rescue brought her to safety. 
I want to thank the community from Tucson 
and beyond for the outpouring of support dur-
ing these difficult months, as well as the Na-
tional Park Service and other federal and local 
partners who deployed every available re-
source to locate Alex and Emily. To know Alex 
was to know someone who had boundless en-
ergy for life and who was focused on making 
a difference in the lives of others. His loss has 
left a void in the hearts of his colleagues and 
his family. He will forever be a part of our fam-
ily, and my heart is with his parents, Joe and 
Ruth, and his loving partner Emily. Our Nation 
has lost a hero. I am thankful to have known 
Alexander Lofgren.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
CLAYTON 
EDWARD 
FRANCIS 
DERDERIAN 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Clayton Edward Francis 
Derderian, who passed away at his home on 
May 16, 2021, at the very young age of 15, 
having fought a long battle against a dev-
astating form of brain and spinal cancer for 12 
years of his much-too-short life. 
Clay was known to family and friends as 
Clay-Bear, Chili Bean, Mr. Dunderfuss, and 
Busby. He was an aspiring chef, inventor, and 
entrepreneur. He was a braille reader but al-
ways preferred to be read to, ideally ‘‘in char-
acter’’. At mealtime he often announced: ‘‘I am 
not hungry, what’s for dessert?’’ He loved a 
good joke or a good story and despite his dis-
ease, somehow managed to love life and es-
pecially the people around him. 
Clay leaves his mother, Mary Bannon, fa-
ther, JD Derderian, sister Grace Derderian 
and grandmothers Rainette Bannon and Inez 
Derderian, as well as loving aunts, uncles and 
cousins. 
The tributes paid to Clay by those who 
knew him well say he was wise beyond his 
years, that he could make a whole room smile 
with just a few words, and that he was wel-
coming and always smiling. He was an amaz-
ingly funny person with a great sense of

humor and brought joy and sweetness to 
every interaction. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in expressing our 
deepest condolences to Clay’s family on their 
profound loss. May they take solace from 
knowing that their beloved son was given the 
best care possible and that he was loved 
deeply. I believe he is now with the angels, 
making them laugh and brightening heaven, 
just as he did during his life with us on earth.

COMMEMORATING THE ‘‘GO FOR 
BROKE’’ FOREVER STAMP 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
join Congressmember ED CASE and my col-
leagues in the Congressional Asian Pacific 
American Caucus to commemorate the ‘‘Go 
For Broke’’ Forever Stamp issued by the U.S. 
Postal Service earlier this month. This stamp 
honors the over 30,000 Japanese American 
soldiers of the 100th Battalion and the 442nd 
Regimental Combat Team who bravely served 
our country during World War II. Despite fac-
ing intense racism and discrimination, these 
soldiers fought valiantly to defend our nation 
and went on to become the most highly deco-
rated military unit in U.S. history. 
The courage of this all Japanese American 
military unit is exemplified in their work to en-
sure that no American solider was left behind 
during the war. In late 1944, Allied troops 
were pushing towards Germany, facing some 
of the fiercest resistance yet, and liberating 
French territory along the way. Looking to take 
advantage of these gains, the men of the 
141st Regiment—made up of mostly Texans— 
moved quickly through dense forests and 
mountains until they unknowingly became sep-
arated from the rest of their fellow soldiers. 
Surrounded by Germans, with both tempera-
tures and supplies running low, and special or-
ders from Hitler himself not to let these troops 
escape no matter the cost, the situation was 
desperate. 
And so, to save these men, we turned to 
the one division we knew had what it would 
take to push through: the 442nd Regimental 
Combat Team—a segregated unit consisting 
entirely of Japanese American troops. For six 
days, this unit fought with almost no rest until 
they pierced the German lines. When one of 
the trapped Texans finally saw who was com-
ing to their rescue he said, ‘‘To our great 
pleasure it was members of the 442nd Com-
bat Team. We were overjoyed to see these 
people for we knew them as the best fighting 
men in [the European theater].’’ 
One of the men from the 442nd who was 
there that day, Ted Ohira, says that was no 
accident. Because of the prejudice of the time 
and the assumption that Japanese Americans 
could not be trusted, Ohira says these Japa-
nese American soldiers were subjected to 
some of the roughest basic training. But he 
was proud of what he went through, saying it 
meant they were able to take more, endure 
more, and go further than anyone. They called 
this their ‘‘Go For Broke’’ mentality, which is 
exactly what they did in risking everything to 
rescue the 221 men of the famous ‘‘Lost Bat-
talion.’’ 
And yet, even as men like Ted Ohira were 
risking and losing their lives for our country, 
their families back home were facing unbeliev-
able discrimination. In fact, while Ted Ohira 
was in Europe, his future wife Chiz and her 
family were being forced onto a bus just down 
the street from their Los Angeles grocery store 
and driven to a prison camp in Arizona. Chiz 
and her family were just some of the over 
120,000 Japanese Americans to be wrongfully 
imprisoned at this time due to President Roo-
sevelt’s shameful Executive Order 9066. 
But for these ‘‘Go For Broke’’ Japanese 
Americans, their patriotism was more impor-
tant than somebody else’s prejudice. And in 
2011, the U.S. Congress awarded these Japa-
nese American Nisei veterans with the Con-
gressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian 
honor that Congress can bestow. And yet, too 
many still do not know about their incredible 
service to our nation. 
That is why, in 2016, I led a letter along with 
the late Congressmember Mark Takai, signed 
by 33 Members of the House and Senate, urg-
ing the U.S. Postal Service to preserve and 
share this inspiring story through a commemo-
rative stamp. This was not only to recognize 
and honor the service and sacrifice of some of 
our most heroic soldiers. It was also to inspire 
others through their example of courage, loy-
alty, and undying patriotism. And I’m so glad 
that we now have a ‘‘Go For Broke’’ Forever 
Stamp to honor the thousands of Japanese 
Americans who signed up to defend freedoms 
they themselves could not enjoy. 
This stamp was so important to me because 
it sent a powerful message that even when 
our government is not living up to our values, 
there are millions of Americans from all back-
grounds who will risk their lives for those val-
ues. And I am proud that I am not alone. 
Starting in 2005, people like Chiz Ohira and 
the Nisei movement have been tireless in their 
work to make sure more Americans under-
stand the service of the Japanese American 
soldiers in World War II. 
I’m grateful for their years of hard work in 
helping make this stamp a reality, and I’m so 
proud that future generations will continue to 
be inspired by this patriotic service.

TRIBUTE TO BRIG. GEN. MILFORD 
BEAGLE, JR. 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a good friend and one 
of our Nations great military leaders as he 
transfers command. Brigadier General Milford 
Beagle, Jr., a native son of South Carolina, 
has led Fort Jackson in his home state since 
2018, and is leaving to take on his next as-
signment as commanding general of the U.S. 
Army’s 10th Mountain Division (Light) at Fort 
Drum in New York. 
A native of Enoree, South Carolina, and a 
graduate of Woodruff High School, Gen. Bea-
gle is the great-grandson of Private Walter 
Beagles, who trained at Camp Jackson in a 
segregated labor battalion in 1918. One hun-
dred years later, Gen. Beagle served three 
years as commander of the Army base where 
his greatgrandfather faced discrimination. The 
twist of fate is not lost on Gen. Beagle, who 
has said, ‘‘I am a Buffalo Soldier, I am a Har-
lem Hellfighter—you see, I am what a Black 
soldier set out to be in the early 1900s and 
even beyond that point. They wanted to be 
viewed as equal, they wanted to dispute the 
myths about Blacks being soldiers. They want-
ed to prove they were worthy enough to wear 
the uniform of our nation.’’ I believe he has ful-
filled the dreams and aspirations of so many 
Black soldiers who came before him. 
Gen. Beagle’s path to leadership began at 
my alma mater, South Carolina State Univer-
sity. There he was a track athlete and grad-
uated with military distinction in 1990. He is 
part of S.C. State’s tremendous legacy as one 
of the largest educators of minority Army offi-
cers in the country. He went on to earn two 
master’s degrees from Kansas State Univer-
sity and the U.S. Army School of Advanced 
Military Studies. 
During his 31-year career, Gen. Beagle has 
served with five regiments, the 3rd U.S. Infan-
try Regiment, the 6th Infantry, the 9th Infantry, 
the 35th Infantry, and the 41st Infantry Regi-
ment, and with five divisions, the 2nd Infantry 
Division, the 2nd Armored Division, the 5th In-
fantry Division, the 10th Mountain Division 
(Light), and the 25th Infantry Division. His key 
staff assignments include service as a planner 
and operations officer at battalion and brigade 
level, and as Chief Plans Branch, G3, Eighth 
Army, Republic of Korea. On the Joint and 
Army Staff, he served as the Joint Strategic 
Planner and later Executive Assistant to the 
Director, J–7, as well as the Division Chief, J– 
5, Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat 
Organization. On the Army Staff, he served as 
the Executive Officer to the Vice Chief of Staff 
of the Army. 
Gen. Beagle’s combat and operational ex-
perience include tours with Operation Iraqi 
Freedom and Operation Inherent Resolve in 
Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom in Af-
ghanistan. 
Gen. Beagle is married to the former Pam-
ela Jones, a native of Blackville, South Caro-
lina. The couple has two children, Jordan and 
Jayden, one an Army Lieutenant and the other 
a college student. 
During his years at Fort Jackson, Gen. Bea-
gle has become a community leader and role 
model. He helped secure the greater Midlands 
area the recognition as a ‘‘Great American De-
fense Community.’’ He has earned the acco-
lades of Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin and 
Columbia Chamber of Commerce CEO Carl 
Blackstone. I join them in commending his tre-
mendous involvement in the community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in saluting the extraor-
dinary service of Brigadier General Beagle. He 
has distinguished himself as a leader in the 
military and in the community. He commands 
the respect of those he leads and those he 
serves. I am proud to call him a friend, and I 
wish him well as he continues his service to 
this great country.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOHN LOWNDES 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor my constituent, John Foy 
Lowndes, who passed away on February 12, 
2021, at the age of 90, after a long and illus-
trious life. 
John was born in Medford, Massachusetts 
and raised in Durham, North Carolina. He 
graduated from Durham High School in 1949 
and went to work as an assistant foreman in 
a tobacco factory. Later that year he gave up 
the tobacco job and enrolled at Duke Univer-
sity. 
Early in his freshman year, John joined the 
Marine Corps Reserve and was given the rank 
of Corporal in the Platoon Leaders group. 
When he graduated from Duke in 1953, he 
was made a Second Lieutenant. 
After a brief stint as a traveling soap sales-
man for Proctor & Gamble, John accepted a 
Marine Corps invitation to The Basic School 
and then went on to Air Control School. He 
was stationed in Miami, among other places, 
and he fell in love with Florida. 
In 1955, John left Miami and active duty 
with the Marine Corps and returned to Durham 
to attend the Duke University School of Law, 
graduating first in his class. 
After law school, John moved to Central 
Florida. He practiced law in Daytona Beach, 
and then in Orlando with the Anderson and 
Rush law firm. 
In 1969, John and three of his law partners 
decided to launch their own firm. The firm 
would flourish, becoming one of the largest 
and most prestigious in the state. 
Beyond his work as an attorney, John was 
a pillar of his Central Florida community. 
He chaired—or served on—many boards, 
including the Orange County Bar, the Orlando 
Museum of Art, Winter Park Memorial Hospital 
(now AdventHealth Winter Park), the Winter 
Park Health Foundation, Friends of the 
Mennella Museum, the Holocaust Center of 
Florida, and the UCF Foundation. 
John shared an enthusiasm for arts and cul-
ture with his wife Rita, and they were instru-
mental in building and naming the John & Rita 
Lowndes Shakespeare Center in Loch Haven 
Park, which opened in 2001. 
John lived a rich and full life, doing well and 
doing good, contributing his time and energy 
to the causes he cared about, and always 
making a positive difference. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
John Foy Lowndes.

JAMES GOLDEN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud James Golden 
for receiving the Gold Medalist Congressional 
Award for 2021. 
The Congressional Award is a prestigious 
award from the United States Congress and is 
awarded to young Americans who dem-
onstrate excellence in four program areas: 
Voluntary Public Service, Personal Develop-
ment, Physical Fitness and Expedition/Explo-
ration. The program recognizes young people 
who strive to challenge themselves and reach 
new goals. 
James received this award because of his 
determination, hard work and achievements in 
these program areas. This year, James is 
being awarded the Gold Medalist Congres-
sional Award—the highest honor and a tre-
mendous accomplishment. 
This type of achievement can only be at-
tained with hard work and perseverance, both 
of which have been exemplified by James. I 
applaud students like James who work to 
make the most of their education, commit to 
being lifelong learners and develop a work 
ethic and new skills which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
James Golden for his work to earn the Gold 
Medalist Congressional Award. I have no 
doubt he will exhibit the same dedication and 
character in all of his future accomplishments.

IN RECOGNITION OF ORLAND FIRE 
PROTECTION DISTRICT 
HON. MARIE NEWMAN 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service of the brave first re-
sponders of the Orland Fire Protection District. 
This exemplary fire district has shown tre-
mendous dedication to protecting the lives and 
property of the residents of Orland Park, 
Orland Hills, and unincorporated areas of 
Orland Township. Due to their excellence, 
Orland Fire Protection District is recognized as 
one of the best fire department organizations 
in Illinois and the country. Chief Michael 
Schofield’s First Command Team and his first 
responder units have won national awards for 
their quick response times, high cardiac save 
rates, and efficient processes and procedures. 
Further, Orland Fire is 1 of 84 internationally 
recognized agencies with both an ISO Class 1 
rating and accredited agency status with the 
Commission on Fire Accreditation International 
(CFAI). They displayed their commendable 
service during the COVID–19 Pandemic when 
they created a first of its kind response model 
to address the immediate needs of the com-
munity. 
I honor their strong leadership, resourceful-
ness, and innovation in dealing with the ef-
fects of COVID–19 directly and swiftly. Their 
drive to share knowledge, equipment, and re-
sources will cut inefficiencies and save even 
more lives. I thank the Orland Fire Protection 
District for their service, resiliency, and brav-
ery. I honor their dedication, not only today, 
but every day. They are our heroes. 
HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
DR. THOMAS J. HYNES, JR. 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
Georgian and a great American, Dr. Thomas 
J. Hynes, Jr., outgoing President of Clayton 
State University. 
Dr. Hynes is retiring as President of Clayton 
State University (CSU) after over ten years of 
serving the institution with honor and distinc-
tion. During this time, he has led the Univer-
sity to success and growth and helped secure 
Clayton State’s position at the forefront of 
Peach State academics. Beloved by Lakers 
across campus, the leadership of Dr. Hynes 
has empowered students and greatly strength-
ened the CSU community. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Hynes has com-
mitted himself to service through education. 
He previously served as Provost and Vice 
President of Academic Affairs and Professor 
of Mass Communication at the University of 
West Georgia. Prior to his time at West Geor-
gia, he served in various departments at the 
University of Louisville for eighteen years. Out-
side of his university experience, Dr. Hynes 
has greatly benefitted our community. He has 
served as the overall Chair for the Clayton 
County Chamber of Commerce, the Chair of 
the Chamber’s Education Committee, a mem-
ber of the Fayette County and Metro Atlanta 
Chambers of Commerce, and on the Atlanta 
Regional Commission, amongst many other 
local and national positions. I express my 
deepest appreciation for the dedication that 
Dr. Hynes has given to the Thirteenth District 
and the state of Georgia. 
Throughout his various tenures, Dr. Hynes 
has instilled his students and others around 
him with exemplary values. He has led by ex-
ample to reflect the importance of service to 
our communities. He has facilitated and en-
couraged an open exchange of ideas, a prin-
ciple too often overlooked in a contentious 
world. Dr. Hynes has taught his students to 
pursue excellence through knowledge and to 
uplift themselves through a quest to reach 
their full potential. I am deeply grateful to Dr. 
Hynes for the impact he has left on future 
generations and I thank him for his ability to 
connect with his students in such a powerful 
way. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Dr. Hynes 
on his retirement from Clayton State University 
and I wish him continued success, health, and 
happiness in the future. CSU is also prepared 
for continued greatness, thanks to Dr. Hynes’ 
commitment to Strategic Plan 2022, an initia-
tive that will give students the resources they 
need to succeed in a changing world, with an 
emphasis on community involvement. 
May God continue to bless Dr. Thomas J. 
Hynes, Jr., and Clayton State University.

Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, con-

determination to get to this point, and this 
team deserves every bit of success. Helio 
Castroneves excelled behind the wheel during 
a riveting race this year. Mike Shank is re-
markable and has led this team to many ac-

GREENWOOD DESIGNATION 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize that Tulsa’s Greenwood Business District 
has been added to the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
Nearly erased by the 1921 Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre, 
the 
Greenwood 
Business 
District 
helped provide a foundation for African Amer-
ican resilience and success. Today, the busi-
ness district has more than 30 African Amer-
ican owned businesses in the last brick build-
ings on Greenwood Avenue in Tulsa. 
Placement on the National Register for His-
toric Places opens possibilities for business 
and property owners to seek historic preserva-
tion and property improvement. 
The preservation of history is critical, and 
I’m glad to see this portion of Tulsa receive 
the historical recognition it deserves.

HONORING CAPTAIN ANDREW G. 
WILLIAMS 
HON. MIKE KELLY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I would like to include in the RECORD the 
following speech that was written by local But-
ler, Pennsylvania historian and my constituent, 
Bill May. It was delivered at a headstone dedi-
cation ceremony for Civil War veteran Andrew 
Gomer Williams. Mr. Williams was a longtime 
resident of Butler where he practiced law. 
Born in Richmond, Virginia, Williams fought for 
the Union in the Civil War as a member of the 
63rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. He also 
attended Duff’s Business College and was a 
tradesman, nail-maker, bookkeeper, and no-
tary public. Williams served the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania as a member of the 
state House of Representatives and state 
Senate as well as the Soldiers’ Orphans 
School Commission. After a long life of service 
to his community and our Nation, Mr. Williams 
died on April 6, 1923 in Butler and was in-
terred in the North Side Cemetery. 
Mr. Williams is an American hero, which is 
why Chad Slater began placing the ‘‘Grand 
Army of the Republic’’ star and flag at his 
grave. The Grand Army of the Republic was a 
fraternal organization composed of veterans of 
the American Civil War. However, since Wil-
liams was not identified on his headstone as 
a veteran, the star and flag were routinely re-
moved. As a result, Mr. Slater, Jason Tindall, 
and VFW 249 began a quest to install a prop-
er headstone that would appropriately recog-
nize Mr. Williams’ service to the people of But-
ler, Western Pennsylvania, and our country. I 
thank each of them for working to preserve 
this vital piece of American history for future 
generations. 
(By Bill May) 
‘‘Monuments are as old as our race and all 
along the history of the dim and dusty age 
down to the bright and joyous present we 
have been perpetuating the memory of he-
roic men’’. These eloquent words, so very ap-
propriate this morning, are not mine, but 
were the actual words of Andrew Gomer Wil-
liams whose monument we gather here this 
morning to dedicate. He delivered them in a 
speech on September 11, 1889 on the Gettys-
burg Battlefield during ceremonies dedi-
cating the monument to his regiment, the 
63rd PA Volunteers, who fought during the 
famous battle on July 1 through the 3rd of 
1863. Much like they gathered on that field 
132 years ago, we gather here today on this 
field to perpetuate the memory of a heroic 
man. 
Ironically, Williams, who had fought for 
the Union, was born in Richmond VA, the 
Capital of the Confederacy on September 8, 
1840 to a Welsh immigrant father and an 
Eastern Maryland mother. His family moved 
from Richmond to Pittsburgh in 1847 and 
from Pittsburgh to Etna one year later. The 
recipient of very little education, Andrew 
Williams went to work as a nail cutter in the 
local factory at the young age of 10. 
Maybe it was the sense of patriotism that 
swelled in Andrew Williams heart or maybe 
it was wanting to escape the dullness of fac-
tory work for the great unknown adventure 
of war, but regardless of the reason, we do 
know that at age 21 in 1861, Williams was 
helping to raise three companies of men to 
become part of the newly created 63rd PA 
Volunteers and leave the smoky city for the 
battlefields of his native South. He was 
elected Captain of Company E, but declined 
the honor and the rank to initially serve as 
their 3rd Sargent when their 3 years of serv-
ice began on September 9 of 1861. 
He was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant on the 
field during the Second Battle of Bull in 1862 
and then in the Spring of 1863 he was pro-
moted to the rank of Captain of Company E 
of the 63rd PA Volunteers. He fought in over 
a dozen battles and was wounded four times 
including at the Charles City Crossroads on 
June 30, 1862 and again at The Battle of Fred-
ericksburg on December 13, 1862. 1863 would 
find Williams leading his men at the Battles 
of Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. During 
the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5, 1864 
Williams was thought to have been mortally 
wounded after being struck in the left tem-
ple by a Confederate minie’ ball and left for 
dead. Miraculously he was found barely alive 
four days later on the Wilderness Battlefield. 
He was mustered out with the rest of his 
regiment on August 6, 1864. Williams would 
carry the external scars from the near fatal 
wound for the rest of his life. 
After his return home to Etna, he was un-
able to work for the next 3 years due to his 
wounds. He entered Duff’s Business College 
in Pittsburgh to become a bookkeeper and 
also read law at home. In 1868, following his 
father’s death in a boiler explosion at the 
Fort Pitt Foundry, he was forced to return 
to cutting nails in the Etna Rolling Mill to 
help support his family while continuing his 
law studies at night. Besides his father’s 
tragic death, Williams throughout his life 
experienced the deaths of 13 members of his 
family by explosions, railroad accidents, 
burnings and drowning. 
In spite of all the personal and family trau-
ma, Andrew G. Williams marched on and 
came to Butler in 1875 and upon being admit-
ted to the Butler Bar the following year he 
immediately formed a partnership with 
Alexander Mitchell. This partnership would 
last until Mitchell’s death 40 years later. 
During these four decades together the men 
claimed to never have had an argument or 
ever having signed a lease for their office on 
the Diamond with their word as their bond. 
The only day in the entire history of their 
practice they did not open was when both 
men’s Civil War Regiments were holding re-
unions on the same date in Pittsburgh. The 
two lawyers closed up shop each afternoon at 
precisely 4:45 p.m. It was said that people 
along their walking route home could set 
their watches by their passing. The house 
Andrew Williams came home to each night 
was the home he built in 1887 for his second 
wife and their 3 sons and 1 daughter and for 
his 3 children from his deceased first wife. 
Williams’ military service in the Civil War 
continued to play an important role in his 
life with his membership in the local chapter 
of the Grand Army of the Republic or GAR, 
a Civil War veterans’ group and contributing 
his time to help those survivors scarred by 
the effects of the war. He helped Civil War 
soldier spouses such as a Mrs. Kettenburgh 
of Edgewood whose husband had served with 
Williams and who came to Butler in 1908 ac-
companied by her two sisters to apply for a 
Civil War Widow’s Pension. Kettenburgh pre-
sented Williams with the photo displayed in 
front of me taken just a few days before Wil-
liam’s near fatal wounding at the Wilder-
ness. He also volunteered serving on the 
Board of Directors of the Civil War Orphans 
Home that was located on Butler’s Institute 
Hill from 1867 until moving to Mercer Coun-
ty in 1905. 
Outside of his legal practice and his Civil 
War related activities, Williams served one 
term in the Pennsylvania House of Rep-
resentatives and four years in the Pennsyl-
vania State Senate. He also served for 20 
years as the Choir Director of Butler’s First 
Methodist Church and rose to the rank of 
Grand Commander Knights of Templar of the 
State of Pennsylvania in the Masons. 
After a full life, devoted to his nation, his 
church, his community and most impor-
tantly his family, Andrew Gomer Williams 
died in his North McKean Street home on 
April 6, 1923 from pneumonia at the age of 83 
@ 10:40 p.m. Fittingly for a man who had 
been a soldier in the Civil War, his funeral 
and burial were held on April 9th the same 
day only 58 years earlier that Robert E. Lee 
had surrendered his Confederate Army to 
Union General Ulysses S. Grant at a place 
called Appomattox Courthouse Virginia.

June 16, 2021 
life of Ms. Rafaela Garcia and to pay tribute to 
her monumental legacy in Kansas City, Mis-
souri. Ms. Garcia, known as ‘‘Lali’’ to her fam-
ily, friends, and neighbors, lived a life of serv-
ice, selflessness, and passionate advocacy. 
She was ambitious and tenacious, with the 
goal of improving life for the Latino community 
guiding her work every step of the way. As I 
stand here today, I can confidently say that we 
all owe Lali an enormous debt of gratitude for 
the progress she fostered towards racial 
equality, advancing the cause of a historically 
marginalized population by championing equal 
opportunity and political representation. Lali’s 
dedication to serving the Latino community as 
an activist, community member, and office 
holder defined her 93 years spent on this 
earth and improved the lives of thousands. 
Lali uplifted the voices of those in need and 
left a profound impact on every person who 
crossed her path. 
Born in 1927, Lali observed and experi-
enced discrimination against the Latino com-
munity along with the severe lack of political 
representation for non-white citizens. During 
her youth, Lali used the discrimination she 
faced in everyday life as a source of motiva-
tion to fight for change. Years later, Lali 
shared stories from this time in her life to re-
mind us of our history and the progress we 
have made. Lali remembered movie theaters 
with segregated seating, jails without due 
process for people of color, restaurants that 
barred admission for Latinos, and inferior edu-
cational opportunities for Latino students. 
Lali’s passion for social advocacy started 
young, at the age of 13, when she first visited 
the Guadalupe Center in Kansas City, Mis-
souri. The Center, at that time, was dedicated 
to administering a school and clinic for under-
privileged immigrants who settled in the mid-
western city. Even at this young age, Lali saw 
the potential for the Center to become a vi-
brant community gathering place, a structure 
to fight against the social inequities she wit-
nessed, and a pillar of the Latino community. 
As Lali served for forty-six years on the Cen-
ter’s Board of Directors, this vision came to 
fruition, with three terms as the Board Presi-
dent. She oversaw a massive expansion of 
the services provided by the Center, advanc-
ing opportunities, services, and protection for 
the Latino community. Today, largely in part to 
Lali’s commitment, the Center has grown to 
provide healthcare, education, financial assist-
ance, childcare, workforce development, and 
more. We are forever indebted to Lali’s work 
to transform this organization as it continues 
to provide opportunities, support, and stability 
for newly arrived immigrants and Kansas City 
natives alike. Her legacy challenges each of 
us to continue making Kansas City a wel-
coming place for immigrants to find a home, 
celebrate their culture, and become part of the 
community. As we follow in her footsteps, we 
must strive to ensure that all those who make 
the journey to the United States feel valued, 
cherished, and loved—the same way Lali 
made all of us feel. 
Beyond her immeasurable work at the Cen-
ter, Lali was a fierce advocate for political 
equality and representation for the Latino com-
munity. Lali understood the importance of re-
sponsive leaders who use their positions in 
the halls of government to protect and uplift all 
members of the community, regardless of race 
or ethnicity. She also recognized the need for 
leaders who would advocate for the fair and 
equal treatment of the Latino community. In 
1989, Lali founded La Raza Political Club. 
Under her leadership, La Raza elected many 
of the first Latinos to public office in Kansas 
City, finally creating a seat at the table for her 
community. During her time with La Raza, Lali 
registered new voters, fought back against dis-
crimination at the polls, and proved the impor-
tance of perceptive leadership. By registering 
hundreds of Latino voters, Lali amplified their 
voices and worked to create a more just, equi-
table, and accepting nation. We are called to 
pick up this duty where Lali left off and to em-
phasize the importance of political engage-
ment in all communities. 
A short recognition cannot adequately de-
scribe the breadth of Lali’s tireless work build-
ing community resources, political representa-
tion, and cultural acceptance. At the end of 
her life, amidst a global pandemic, her work 
never ceased. Lali served as a member of the 
Guadalupe Centers Board of Directors; the 
Jackson County Ethics, Human Relations, & 
Citizen Complaints Commission; and the Civil 
Rights Consortium. She was also a member of 
the Union Cultural Mexicana Ladies Auxiliary 
and a full-time volunteer at the Casa Felix 
Senior Center. Lali was also appointed to the 
Guadalajara Sister City Commission and the 
Port Authority Board of Commissioners and 
has served on the Mayor’s Prayer Breakfast 
Committee since 1987. Intentional acts of 
humble service filled each minute of her life. 
Lali’s commitment to those around her teach-
es us what it means to be an outspoken and 
selfless advocate and to meaningfully partici-
pate in the community. 
Lali’s life reminds us that a single individual 
relentlessly fighting for what is right can, in 
fact, change the world around us. Change re-
quires a person with the courage to acknowl-
edge the unjust, the persistence to carry on 
through hardship, the will to protest loudly, 
and the spirit to fight until all are seen as 
equal. For Lali, this all came naturally, and her 
leadership has left a legacy that will continue 
to change lives for generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, let us rise each day and ask 
ourselves, as Lali Garcia did, how we can 
positively impact our community. Today, and 
every day, let us be fervent in service, gentle 
in heart, and motivated by love—just like Lali 
before us.

boat making, manufacturing, and farming his-
tory that Grafton is known for. 
Ed’s passion and dedication for the history 
of Grafton will carry on through the museum

Again, I thank Ed for the legacy he left be-
hind and congratulations to his wife Bobbie 
and the entire community. I look forward to 
visiting this great addition to the City of Graf-
ton.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MAYOR 
RUDY DURHAM 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the public service career of 
Rudy Durham, the former mayor of Lewisville, 
Texas. Mayor Durham devoted almost 30 
years of his life in service to his hometown. 
Mayor Durham’s second 3-year term as 
mayor of Lewisville concluded in May 2021, 
ending 27 consecutive years of service in pub-
lic office. Prior to his election to the Lewisville 
City Council in 1994, he volunteered as a 
member of the Planning and Zoning commis-
sion. He served as a city councilman for ten 
years prior to his first run for mayor. 
In his business career, he was a Profes-
sional Appraiser and Real Estate Broker, and 
he retired as Chief Appraiser for the Denton 
Central Appraisal District in 2019. Mayor Dur-
ham takes great pride in being a fourth-gen-
eration Lewisville resident and he is the fifth 
Lewisville High School alumnus to serve as 
the city’s mayor. During his high school ath-
letic career, Mayor Durham qualified for two 
state meets in shotput and played on the 1972 
state finalist football team. His work on behalf 
of his community since his graduation in 1974 
has merited him a place in the Lewisville High 
School Hall of Fame. 
Under his leadership, Lewisville has contin-
ued to grow and thrive, even under the difficult 
circumstances of the COVID–19 pandemic. I 
am pleased to join the residents and busi-
nesses of Lewisville in commending Mayor 
Durham for his efforts to protect his constitu-
ents and enhance their quality of life. As 
Mayor Durham returns to private life, I would 
like to thank him for his longstanding devotion 
to his community and wish him the very best 
in all his future endeavors.

Camas High School team qualified for the Na-
tional Finals and competed at the highest level 
against other high schools across the country. 
I am so proud of our students for pursuing 
their passions in STEM and dedicating their 
extra-curricular time to learning and inno-
vating. The American Rocketry Challenge al-
lowed the students to design, build, and 
launch model rockets, which exposed the 
team to different forms of engineering, prob-
lem solving, and teamwork. And of course, the 
product of all their hard work was that they 
reached new heights that I’m sure many 
thought wasn’t possible. It always amazes me 
what our high school students are able to ac-
complish. 
Congratulations to our Camas High School 
team for earning this great honor. I would like 
to thank the students, teachers, and parents 
for their commitment to STEM education in 
Southwest Washington.

RECOGNIZING 
SAMANTHA 
AND 
ALEXANDER 
EDWARDS’ 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
one of the great honors that I have as a 
United States Congressman is to nominate 
young adults from my District for admission to 
our Nation’s service academies, and during 
my time in Congress I have become ac-
quainted with many fine young persons who 
have sought a nomination to one of the serv-
ice academies. Today, I rise to give recogni-
tion to two such young persons who are my 
constituents, Samantha Scott Edwards and 
Alexander Thompson Edwards, from Mercer 
Island, Washington. 
In 2018, I nominated Samantha to the 
United States Military Academy Class of 2022, 
and this spring I nominated Samantha’s broth-
er Alex to the United States Military Academy 
Class of 2025. This coming academic year 
Samantha will be a senior at West Point, while 
Alex will be a freshman plebe, and both Alex 
and Samantha will be competing on the West 
Point varsity swim team. While it is not un-
usual for West Point cadets to have relatives 
who have attended West Point, it is uncom-
mon for a brother and sister to attend West 
Point at the same time, let alone compete on 
the same athletic team. 
Samantha and Alex are incredibly talented 
in the pool and classroom and both have been 
named as Academic All Americans by USA 
Swimming. 
Samantha now holds two West Point 
records in relay events and is in the all-time 
Academy top 10 rankings for her individual 
times in the 100 yard and 200 yard freestyle 
events. For her Senior year at West Point, 
Samantha has been appointed as a Team 
Academic Mentor, which is a recognition of 
Samantha’s own scholarship as well as her 
ability to provide scholastic mentorship to 
other team members. 
In addition to earning Academic All-Amer-
ican status from USA Swimming for his scho-
lastic achievements, Alex served as Captain of 
his high school swim team and received his 
high school’s 2020 ‘‘Excellence in Elective 
Studies in History’’ Award. In recognition of his 
accomplishments in the pool, the National 
Interscholastic Swim Coaches Association has 
twice designated Alex as an All-American 
swimmer. 
As their Congressman and Chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, I am 
pleased that Alex and Samantha have each 
chosen to attend West Point to become offi-
cers in the United States Army. Given their 
academic achievements, as well as their ath-
letic talents, these outstanding young adults 
could have gone to any number of fine univer-
sities—that they have chosen to attend West 
Point and serve our Nation’s Armed Forces 
speaks volumes about their character and 
commitment. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Samantha and Alex. I am proud they are my 
constituents, look forward to great things from 
them, and wish them the very best in the fu-
ture.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AMERICAN PHYS-
ICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of the 100th anniversary of the 
American Physical Therapy Association. 
The APTA is the leading professional mem-
bership organization for the physical therapy 
profession, with a mission to build a commu-
nity that advances the profession and im-
proves the health of society. 
As the predecessors to modern-day physical 
therapists, reconstruction aides were strong 
women who played an integral role in the re-
covery of many soldiers during World War I. 
Through their work, they demonstrated the 
value of the physical therapy and the impact 
it would have in the future of American 
healthcare. 
The vision of the physical therapy profes-
sion is to transform society by optimizing 
movement to improve the human experience. 
The efforts to launch a physical therapy edu-
cation program began in 1960, with the first 
two classes of physical therapist assistants 
entering the workforce in 1969. Throughout its 
history, physical therapy has had a role in mili-
tary hospitals, on the response team during 
the polio epidemic, and is currently helping 
those recovering from the novel coronavirus. 
The work of a physical therapist spans 
many settings, from hospitals to homes, 
schools to veteran facilities. Physical therapy 
has been effective at reducing pain and being 
a first-line approach that has assisted count-
less Americans. During these difficult times, 
physical therapists and physical therapist as-
sistants have faced their challenges head on, 
treating the most vulnerable and working with 
those recovering from the severe effects of 
COVID–19. 
Please join me in commemorating the 100th 
Anniversary of the American Physical Therapy 
Association.

REMEMBER1NG DR. SAMUEL L. 
MYERS, SR. 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, my district, 
the State of Maryland, and our country have 
lost an extraordinary citizen, an outstanding 
contributor to education and leader for Histori-
cally 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs). Dr. Samuel L. Myers, who was a 
trailblazer for equality and a pioneer in eco-
nomics and higher education, passed away at 
the age of 101 on January 8 and will be re-
membered at a memorial service later this 
month. I was honored to know him and work 
closely with him over the years to advance the 
important causes he championed. 
Born in Baltimore, Dr. Myers was the son of 
Jamaican immigrants and grew up in a home 
that strongly valued education and public serv-
ice. After earning his undergraduate degree in 
1940 from Morgan State University and a 
master’s degree from Boston University in 
1942—both in economics—he was drafted into 
the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of Captain 
while serving in the Pacific Theater. At the 
time, of course, our military was segregated, 
and Dr. Myers was a trailblazer in speaking 
out against the injustices facing African-Amer-
ican servicemembers, risking court martial. 
Following his honorable discharge from serv-
ice in 1946, he studied at Harvard University 
and completed his doctorate in economics in 
1949, studying with some of the most re-
nowned scholars at that time, including John 
Kenneth Galbraith. 
As an economist, Dr. Myers focused on in-
equalities and the effects of segregation on Af-
rican-American businesses and families. That 
interest led him into government service, and 
he worked as a research economist for the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics while teaching at 
his alma mater of Morgan State. Recognizing 
his leadership abilities and his deep commit-
ment to education, Bowie State University se-
lected him as its fourth president in 1968. Dur-
ing his tenure, which lasted until 1977, Dr. 
Myers reshaped Maryland’s oldest HBCU and 
laid the groundwork for its success, preparing 
graduates to seize the opportunities of our 
twenty-first century economy. While pioneering 
the launch of computer science programs and 
new educational practices, he worked to se-
cure funding for new buildings to replace 
those that were crumbling and dilapidated, 
and he supported students who had protested 
against unfair budgets that disadvantaged his-
torically African-American campuses in Mary-
land and nationwide. 
In 1977, Dr. Myers stepped down as Presi-
dent of Bowie State University but continued 
his passionate commitment to HBCUs. He be-
came President of the National Association for

Equal 
Opportunity 
in 
Higher 
Education 
(NAFEO) and continued to lead that organiza-
tion for eighteen years. In that capacity, he 
lobbied for HBCUs and was instrumental in 
the 1980 Executive Order, signed by President 
Carter, directing that federal funding for higher 
education be prioritized for HBCUs, a principle 
that has since been expanded to include insti-
tutions serving Hispanic and Native American 
tribal communities. The recipient of many 
awards and recognitions for his contributions 
to equality in education, Dr. Myers continued 
even after his retirement from overseeing 
NAFEO to be a leader in this national effort, 
chairing the board of Minority Access, which 
helps build partnerships between minority- 
serving institutions and major research univer-
sities. He was also a longstanding supporter 
of foreign language programs and cultural ex-
changes that expand young Americans’ views 
of our world and help build bridges with stu-
dents and scholars from other nations. 
Dr. Myers will be remembered as a man of 
vision and of service. His legacy will not be 
forgotten by the millions of students who were 
able to access high-quality undergraduate and 
graduate programs and pursue their dreams 
because of his tireless efforts. Maryland will 
long remember Dr. Samuel L. Myers among 
the pantheon of our great native sons and 
daughters who dedicated their lives and ca-
reers to the improvement of our society, the 
expansion of opportunities, and the cause of 
justice and equality for all. 
I offer my condolences to his children, Dr. 
Yvette Myers and Dr. Samuel Myers, Jr., 
along with their families. Their father now joins 
their wonderful mother Marion Myers—who 
was his partner for sixty-four years—and their 
sister Judge Tama Clark, who passed away 
last year, in peaceful eternal rest. May his 
memory continue to bless and inspire so many 
in Maryland and in our country to pursue serv-
ice and help build a more perfect union for fu-
ture generations of Americans.

RECOGNIZING GARY T. JOHNSON 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. Gary T. Johnson on con-
cluding a lengthy and illustrious career as 
President and CEO of the Chicago History 
Museum. 
After nearly three decades of legal practice 
in Chicago, Gary made his arrival at the Chi-
cago History Museum in 2005, beginning his 
tenure as President by transitioning the Chi-
cago Historical Society into the Chicago His-
tory Museum as we know it today. 
For more than 15 years, Gary spent his time 
as President focusing on community outreach 
and strengthening the institution’s financial ca-
pacity. Along the way, he also headed Muse-
ums in the Park, a group of 11 museums on 
land owned by the Chicago Park District. 
During his time as President, Gary brought 
significant improvements to the museum. He 
completed a $27 million campaign and imple-
mented the Museum’s 2006 ‘‘reinvention,’’ 
which included renovating 75 percent of its 
space, announcing a name change, and in-
stalling the highly praised Exelon Crossroads 
exhibition, the Museum’s foundational over-
view of Chicago history. Additionally, he in-
creased the museum’s annual attendance by 
89 percent over a 10-year period and ex-
tended school visits to 60,000 students annu-
ally. 
One of Gary’s most important and more re-
cent accomplishments was the completion of 
the landmark five-year, $50 million This Is Chi-
cago campaign, an effort which involved rais-
ing $11 million for the museum’s endowment, 
acquiring millions of artifacts, increasing edu-
cation program offerings, and more. 
Educated at Yale College, Oxford Univer-
sity, and Harvard Law School, Gary never lost 
his commitment to supporting the educational 
aspirations of students in Chicago and be-
yond. For over ten years, he led the Rhodes 
Scholarship selection process for the district 
that includes Illinois, while also dedicating his 
time to visiting over 300 of Chicago’s grade 
schools—bringing with him artifacts from the 
Museum’s 
collection 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
Chicagoans had access to the city’s greatest 
treasures. 
Madam Speaker, please join me and all of 
our colleagues in the House of Representa-
tives in recognizing Mr. Gary T. Johnson’s 
years of service to the City of Chicago and 
congratulating him on his retirement.

Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Jonah Campbell, Clark Hegewald, and Grant 
Myers of Vancouver iTech Preparatory on 
having their National History Day project 
showcased by the Smithsonian National Mu-
seum of American History at the Smithsonian 
Learning Lab. 
Their project, titled ‘‘No Need for Trans-
lation: The Apollo-Soyuz Mission’’, focuses on 
the bilateral cooperation between the United 
States and the Soviet Union in ending the 
Space Race through the construction of the 
first space station. The team placed particular 
emphasis on the unprecedented collaboration 
between Americans and Soviets at the height 
of the Cold War. 
For over 40 years, National History Day has 
been a stellar opportunity for students across 
the country to engage in and expand their 
knowledge of American history through re-
search-based projects. I hope that partici-
pating in National History Day has allowed 
these students to deepen their appreciation for 
the great American history that unites us all. 
Once again, I want to congratulate Jonah, 
Clark, and Grant on a job well done. 
ARTHROGRYPOSIS MULTIPLEX 
CONGENITA AWARENESS DAY 
HON. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the National Day of 
Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC) on 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021. This condition is 
present in 1 in 3,000 babies a year, which 
causes many joints of the body to be stiff and 
crooked at birth. There are over 400 different 
types of AMC, which is an umbrella diagnosis 
that derives from many syndromes. This con-
dition is not curable, but it is treatable. A new-
born with AMC lacks the range of motion in 
one of more joints, but with early intervention, 
therapies can help children achieve their cog-
nitive, social, emotional, and physical develop-
ment goals. New York State has one of the 
most active AMC awareness organizations 
with grassroots efforts located in my district, 
the borough of Staten Island, NY. My con-
stituent, Valerie Pepe, was born with AMC on 
June 11, 1967. Valerie now hosts the AMC 
Music Festival which helps raise money and 
awareness for those affected by AMC. Thank 
you for allowing me to recognize her efforts 
and to bring awareness to the families af-
fected by AMC. As a member of the Rare Dis-
ease Caucus, it is my hope that Congress will 
continue to encourage research and medical 
innovation to treat AMC.

ENACTING CLIMATE INFRASTRUC-
TURE AND THE AMERICAN JOBS 
PLAN 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to speak about the importance of including cli-
mate change focused provisions in any forth-
coming infrastructure package. 
My district of Sacramento, one of the most 
flood-prone cities in the nation, relies on mod-
ernized flood control infrastructure to protect 
against the threat of inundations intensified by 
climate change. Just last year, my home state 
of California experienced the wildfire season 
on record and this year, we are bracing for 
what will be one of the worst droughts in re-
cent decades. All of these are testaments that 
the climate crisis is here . . . and we have no 
time for half measures. 
As 
we 
make 
the most consequential 
generational investments on our nation’s 
crumbling 
infrastructure, 
Congress 
must 
prioritize bold investments in resilience, clean 
energy, jobs, and environmental justice while 
lowering our carbon footprint to avert the worst 
impacts of the climate crisis. The President’s 
American Jobs Plan does just that. 
As a leader in clean transportation and 
strong vehicle emission standards, I am 
thrilled to see that the American Jobs Plan will 
spark the electric vehicle revolution. The AJP 
would build a network of five hundred thou-
sand EV chargers, replace fifty thousand die-
sel transit vehicles with cleaner vehicles, cre-
ate a million jobs in the auto industry, and 
help consumers purchase the vehicles of to-
morrow. These infrastructure improvements 
are critical to lower transportation emissions, 
the largest source of carbon pollution in the 
United States, and to decrease tailpipe pollu-
tion which disproportionately impacts commu-
nities of color. 
Further, the American Jobs Plan will help us 
meet this moment with a visionary agenda that 
elevates every community-creating at least 2.7 
million jobs in the new green economy and in-
vesting 40 percent of infrastructure funds in 
disadvantaged communities. 
It is time for Congress to follow the Presi-
dent’s leadership and pass an infrastructure 
package that will help us build a cleaner econ-
omy that values workers, communities of 
color, and all Americans who need environ-
mental, climate, and economic justice. In 
2021, we cannot address infrastructure without 
addressing climate change. 
IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT 
HILLER 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the service of Robert 
Hiller, also known as ‘‘Racecar Bob’’, on his 
efforts to raise money for the Sedalia, Missouri 
Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) 
program. 
Bob has been serving his community and 
the region for over three decades, working 
with law enforcement agencies across seven 
different states. He has done this with the help 
of his iconic racecar—he offers rides and ap-
pears in the program’s annual car show in 
order to raise money as well as spread aware-
ness. Next year will be Bob’s 31st appearance 
in the car show—the same number as his 
racecar. 
The Sedalia D.A.R.E. Officers, through 
Bob’s efforts, have been able to serve around 
20,000 students without having to rely on pub-
lic tax money, and they will be able to do so 
for another seven years without needing future 
funding. Additionally, the program has been 
able to establish two $500 scholarships for 
local high school students. 
Bob has had an incredible impact in edu-
cating young people about the dangers of sub-
stance abuse and making sure they stay safe 
and healthy. We are incredibly grateful for his 
service.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR. 
GEORGE BERCI 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise in recogni-
tion of the tremendous contributions of Dr. 
George Berci, a beloved American and resi-
dent of California’s 33rd Congressional Dis-
trict. With decades of work as an inventor, en-
gineer, professor and author, Dr. Berci’s inno-
vative genius and generous spirit has im-
pacted not only the world of medicine but also 
laid the foundation for future advancement in 
surgical technologies. 
Born in Hungary in 1921, Dr. Berci’s family 
immigrated to Vienna where he studied the 
violin. They returned to Hungary in the late 
1930’s when the rise of Nazi Germany forced 
thousands of Jewish people to emigrate from 
Austria. He re-learned Hungarian, graduated 
from high school, and studied mechanical en-
gineering for three years. 
In 1942, Dr. Berci was conscripted into a 
forced labor camp in his native Hungary. Near 
the end of the war, George escaped a Nazi 
march toward Auschwitz and returned behind 
German lines to Budapest to find his mother. 
He joined the underground where he used his 
German language skills to save many still in 
the ghetto. 
In war ravaged, communist-controlled Hun-
gary, Dr. Berci attended Medical School and 
completed his surgical residency. During this 
time, he was arrested for confronting the Com-
munist Party, wrote his first research papers, 
and escaped during the 1956 Hungarian Rev-
olution to Melbourne, Australia. Following his 
escape, he was awarded a Rockefeller Fellow-
ship in surgery in Vienna, Austria. After work-
ing many years in a laboratory, Dr. Berci be-
came an Associate Professor of Surgery in the 
Department of Surgery at the University of 
Melbourne. 
Dr. Berci performed a one-year fellowship at 
the University of Seattle and in 1970, accept-
ed the position of Director of Surgical Endos-
copy and Surgical Research at Cedars of Leb-
anon Hospital and later Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center 
under 
the 
chairmanship 
and 
mentorship of the great Leon Morgenstern. He 
was later named Clinical Professor of Surgery 
at the University of California, Los Angeles 
and the University of Southern California. 
In his 70-year career, Dr. Berci changed the 
face of surgery and anesthesiology by pio-
neering many endoscopic and laparoscopic 
techniques that provide the basis for virtually 
all minimally invasive surgeries performed 
today. George’s many major contributions to 
the science and medical communities include 
his notable leadership as a part of the Society 
of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic 
Surgeons’ laparoscopic safety and efficiency 
training programs. Through this program he 
developed the first miniature endoscopic video 
camera, creating a video intubation scope and 
invented the VITOM surgical video micro-
scope. 
George 
also 
developed 
other 
endoscopic instruments and procedures used 
in urology, gynecology, general, and thoracic 
surgery, operative laryngology, office laryn-
gology, and pediatric surgery—where his mini-
ature endoscopes allowed endoscopic surgery 
in children. 
Dr. Berci has been widely recognized for his 
work, having been awarded 21 major pres-
tigious awards, including: the Glissan Prize 
(Australia) and the American College of 
Jacobson Innovation Award. In addition, Karl 
Storz Endoscopy endowed a Chair in Surgery 
position in his honor, the University of Hun-
gary awarded him an honorary PhD, and Ce-
dars-Sinai Medical Center presented him with 
their 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award. 
As a prolific speaker, writer, and researcher, 
Dr. Berci has delivered hundreds of lectures, 
published 12 books and 238 publications in 
peer reviewed journals worldwide. His revolu-
tionization of the field of minimally invasive 
surgery, and his impact as a mentor to a gen-
eration of surgeons, has made a lasting mark 
on the entire medical community. 
At 100 years of age, Dr. George Berci con-
tinues to serve the medical community at 
Cedar-Sinai’s Hospital in Los Angeles, teach-
ing residents at the Women’s Guild Simulation
