HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF TONY CORBO 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 18, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
the heaviest of hearts that I rise today to pay 
tribute to Tony Corbo, one of the original 
founders of Food and Water Watch. Tony was 
one of the fiercest consumer advocates I have 
ever had the good fortune to have known and 
his loss will be deeply felt by all of those who 
had the opportunity to know and work with 
him. 
‘‘Fight Like You Live Here’’ was a motto that 
drove Tony’s passionate advocacy in food 
safety. He described himself as a ‘‘watchdog 
of big Ag’’ and it was profession to which he 
dedicated himself for more than twenty years. 
He held a particular focus on food safety, con-
sumer safety, and worker health which led to 
his ardent efforts to both better protect our 
food supply as well as food processing work-
ers. During my tenure in Congress, l worked 
closely with Tony on critical issues—from Chi-
nese chicken and linespeeds in slaughter-
houses to worker safety issues and advancing 
trade policies that protect consumers. His pas-
sion led to an expertise and keen under-
standing of food safety and consumer issues 
that was second to none. 
Outside of his professional contributions, 
Tony was also a dedicated member of the 
Washington, D.C. community. An avid Nation-
als fan and season ticket holder, he enjoyed 
attending the games and rooting for his team. 
He was also an enthusiastic gardener and bee 
keeper and in what free time he had, Tony 
could also be found volunteering at the local 
garden shop. He had an engaging personality 
with a contagious laugh, the combination of 
which could draw anyone in. Tony was a spe-
cial soul and that larger than life spirit will be 
missed by many. 
Tony was a fervent ally who provided myself 
and my staff with invaluable counsel over the 
years. He was not one to take no for an an-
swer or shy away from a fight which is why we 
worked so well together. Over the years, Tony 
and I developed a friendship for which I will al-
ways be grateful. 
Though taken from us much too soon, I am 
honored to have this opportunity to stand and 
recognize Tony Corbo for the indelible mark 
that he left on all those who knew him. I ex-
tend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Eliza-
beth, as well as his brother, Joe, and sister, 
Cathy. His is a legacy that will continue to in-
spire those who knew him. 
CONSTITUTION 
DAY 
AND 
THE 
PRESIDENT’S ASSAULT ON THE 
CONSTITUTION 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 18, 2020 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Constitution Day. Every year, on Sep-
tember 17, Constitution Day reminds us that 
while we are a nation of diverse races, 
ethnicities, religions, backgrounds, and stories, 
we share at least one commonality: a collec-
tive belief in the amended document that 
founded our nation. 
The Constitution represents what our nation 
strives to be: a country of laws, fairness, and 
justice. A nation that strives to protect the 
rights of each of its citizens and inhabitants 
and embolden, not subvert, the pursuit of life, 
liberty, and happiness. 
The Founding Fathers always realized that 
the Constitution is an imperfect document, and 
that is why they allowed it to be amended. It 
has been amended twenty-seven times since 
its original ratification, and there are still peo-
ple who are proposing additional amendments. 
The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery, 
and the Fourteenth Amendment abolished the 
provision 
that 
counted 
African 
American 
slaves as three-fifths of a human being. The 
Nineteenth Amendment gave most, but not all, 
women the right to vote. Some provisions of 
our Constitution are still being debated by the 
American people, such as the Second Amend-
ment. 
The Founding Fathers allowed for these 
amendments because they understood that 
the Constitution would always represent a vi-
sion of a more perfect nation, and that vision 
must necessarily change and evolve over 
time. The Founding Fathers risked their lives 
to rebel against tyranny, and their struggle to 
win the freedom to write the Constitution must 
serve as a reminder to us that we too, if need 
be, must struggle to defend it. 
We must honor Constitution Day not only by 
celebrating the document, but by pledging to 
protect it. Because this year, the Constitution 
is in need of our protection. 
The President of the United States took an 
oath to ‘‘preserve, protect and defend the 
Constitution’’. It is an oath required by Article 
Two, Section One of the Constitution. Yet it is 
an oath that has not been taken seriously or 
upheld for four years now. 
The First Amendment protects our freedom 
to peacefully assemble. Yet this President has 
deployed 
unmarked, 
unidentified 
federal 
agents to localities to tear gas and attack 
Americans who are peacefully assembling. 
The First Amendment protects freedom of 
speech, yet an executive order was signed 
this year directing the federal government to 
reconsider the laws governing online speech 
after the President’s online posts were marked 
as false and misleading. The executive order 
was an attempt to silence this President’s crit-
ics, in clear violation of the First Amendment. 
If a person’s right to free speech depends on 
a ruler approving what is said, then free 
speech does not exist at all. 
The First Amendment protects the freedom 
of the press. In violation of this amendment, 
the President has called the press the ‘‘enemy 
of the people’’. 
Article One of the Constitution contains the 
Foreign Emoluments Clause, which prohibits 
the President from receiving any gift of value 
without the consent of Congress. This Presi-
dent has never divested from any of his hold-
ings and refused to place his assets in a blind 
trust. Funds from foreign governments con-
tinue to flow into this President’s personal ac-
counts, in blatant violation of Article One. 
Article Two, Section Three of the Constitu-
tion obligates the President to ‘‘take care that 
the laws be faithfully executed’’, yet this is a 
President who, on at least ten separate occa-
sions, deliberately attempted to interfere with 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation 
into collaboration between Russia and the 
President’s campaign. 
The Fifth Amendment states that all per-
sons, citizen or otherwise, shall be afforded 
due process of law. This President created a 
family separation policy that tore children from 
their families and indefinitely imprisoned them 
in cages, in flagrant violation of their Fifth 
Amendment rights. 
The Constitution protects freedom of religion 
and guarantees all people equal protection 
under the law. In direct violation of these free-
doms, this President banned people from en-
tering the United States based on nothing 
more than the religion they practice. He even 
called it a ‘‘Muslim Ban’’. 
The Constitution states that Congress has 
the power to establish post offices, and this 
President took an oath to defend this provision 
of the Constitution. In violation of his oath and 
this constitutional provision, this President is 
making every effort to dismantle the agency 
that, today, is an inseparable part of our 
shared American identity. 
The ‘‘right to vote’’ is mentioned five times 
in the Constitution. Yet this President admitted 
to voter suppression when he stated that he 
did not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service 
because doing so would help Americans vote 
by mail. 
Upon exiting the Constitutional Convention 
in 1787, Benjamin Franklin was approached 
by a group of people asking what sort of gov-
ernment the delegates had created. His an-
swer was: ‘‘A republic, if you can keep it’’. On 
this Constitution Day, let us remember our re-
sponsibility to defend the Constitution, so that 
we may ‘‘keep it’’.
