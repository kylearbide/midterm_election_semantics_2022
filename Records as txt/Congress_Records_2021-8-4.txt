PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, in these challenging 
days, our hearts are steadfast toward 
You. Empower our lawmakers to grasp 
Your firm hand, depending on You to 
lead them through the darkness to the 
light. 
Lord, lead them safely to the fortress 
of Your choosing, for You desire to give 
them a future and a hope. Provide our 
Senators with the power to do Your 
will as they more fully realize that 
they are servants of Heaven and stew-
ards of Your gifts. May they make in-
tegrity the litmus test by which they 
evaluate each action as You keep them 
from deviating from Your chosen path. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

uncommon 
pairing 
of 
Senators 
WARNOCK and CRUZ was adopted yester-
day by voice vote. Miracles happen 
even here in the Senate. 
So the Senate is making great 
progress on amendments, and we are 
going to make further progress very 
soon. While the specific number of ad-
ditional amendments has yet to be 
agreed to, I believe we can consider an-
other substantial tranche on the floor 
today. Senators should expect multiple 
rollcall votes this afternoon. 
EVICTION MORATORIUM 
Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, 
millions of American families were 
able to breathe a sigh of relief as the 
Biden administration announced an ex-
tension of the eviction moratorium 
that expired last month. 
According to the CDC, the new ban 
on evictions will apply for 60 days 
across regions of the country that are 
experiencing high levels of COVID in-
fections. In total, roughly 90 percent of 
American renters—90 percent—will be 
protected by this order. That is what 
the head of the CDC told me yesterday. 
There are so many individuals who 
helped make this happen. First, I ap-
plaud the President—President Biden— 
and the CDC for taking action to pro-
tect American families. I want to com-
mend Speaker PELOSI. She and I 
worked closely together to get this 
done from our first conversations with 
the President at the White House on 
Thursday, on through the weekend and 
the beginning of this week. 
But I also want to recognize the 
amazing courage of my colleagues, in-
cluding Representatives OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, JONES, and GOMEZ and, above all, 
Representative CORI BUSH. 
Congresswoman BUSH knows what it 
is like to be evicted. She knows the 
pain and fear and indignity of being 
told to get your things and get out. 
When you lose your home, you lose ev-
erything. It is hard to get to a job if 
you have it. 
What do the kids do about school? 
What if there is a local clinic taking 
care of somebody with a healthcare 
problem? 
You lose your home and that is it. 
The roof, literally and figuratively, 
falls in. 
Well, 
Congresswoman 
BUSH
has 
known this through her own experi-
ence, and she took her passion and con-
verted it into effective action. I salute 
to her. It is a moment of history that 
shows when you persist, you can get 
things done. For four nights, she slept 
on the steps of the Capitol, drawing at-
tention to this issue in a way we rarely 
see from a Member of Congress. She 
made yesterday’s announcement pos-
sible. So amazing credit lies with Con-
gresswoman BUSH and the Americans 
who joined her in her righteous cause. 
And, of course, I want to give real 
credit as well to Senator BROWN, our 
chairman of the Banking Committee, 
who worked hard on this issue along 
with Senator WARREN and many others 
in the Senate. 
While yesterday’s announcement by 
the CDC was very welcome, it is only 
the first step. In the weeks ahead, the 
administration must continue working 
with State governments to better dis-
tribute emergency rental assistance 
that Congress has appropriated at the 
end of the last year. The money is 
there. We in Congress provided it. 
I want to call out my State of New 
York, which has done a poor job at dis-
tributing this money. Two weeks ago, 
along with housing advocates, I called 
on the State to move things more 
quickly. A week before that, New York 
State along with South Carolina were 
the only two States that sent out no 
dollars—no dollars. Some of our local-
ities that didn’t cede the money to the 
State have done a better job, like Mon-
roe County, where Rochester is. But 
too much of the money is just sitting 
up there in Albany. 
We need Mike Hine, who is head of 
the relevant administrative depart-
ment in the State, and all of the State 
to get that money out fast. 
An eviction ban is a good thing. It 
prevents people from being kicked out 
of their homes. Once the eviction ban 
ends, if there is not rental assistance, 
we are back in the same boat. We need 
the States to get that money out. 
State governments—my State of New 
York—must do a better job of getting 
that support out the door and into the 
hands of Americans who need help. 
One other thing, there is not Treas-
ury bureaucracy in the way. States 
like Texas, like Monroe County, have 
been able to get out a lot of the money. 
The fault lies in the State governments 
that are not doing this, and they have 
to move. 
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
AUMF. Today, the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee will vote on the re-
peal of the authorization for the use of 
military force in Iraq. This authoriza-
tion was initially passed by Congress in 
2002, 19 years ago. It has far outlived its 
usefulness. 
The Iraq war has been over for nearly 
a decade. An authorization passed in 
2002 is no longer necessary in 2021. It 
has been nearly 10 years since this par-
ticular authorization has been cited as 
a primary justification for a military 
operation, and there is a real danger to 
letting these legal authorities persist 
indefinitely. Allowing an authorization 
for military force to just lie around 
forever is an invitation to a future ad-
ministration to use it for any military 
adventurism in the region. Americans, 
frankly, are sick of endless wars in the 
Middle East. 
Congress simply has to exert more 
authority over matters of war and 
peace, as we all know the Constitution 
prescribes. So, this morning, I reiterate 
my strong support for the repeal of the 
2002 authorization of military force in 
Iraq. I urge the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, under the able lead-
ership of Chairman MENENDEZ, to ad-
vance the measure to the floor. 
I want to thank Chairman MENENDEZ, 
Senator KAINE, and every Republican 
cosponsor of the bill for working to 
bring this issue to the floor. 
As majority leader, in consultation 
with Chairman MENENDEZ, I intend to 
bring up the repeal for a vote on the 
Senate floor later this year. Members 
should be on notice: We are going to 
vote on this. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Now, Mr. President, finally, judicial 
nominations. One of our most impor-
tant jobs here in the Senate is to con-
firm President Biden’s judicial ap-
pointments. The Democratic majority 
in the Senate is committed to swiftly 
and consistently filling judicial vacan-
cies with highly qualified, ideologically 
mainstream, and professionally and de-
mographically diverse jurists. Later 
this week, the Senate will have the op-
portunity to confirm another judge 
who meets all three of these criteria. 
Last night, I filed cloture on the 
nomination of Eunice Lee to serve on 
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Since the Second Circuit covers my 
home State of New York and is one of 
the most important Federal courts in 
the country, it was my honor to have 
recommended Ms. Lee to the White 
House for an appointment. She will be 
the fourth circuit judge confirmed in 
the first 7 months of the Biden admin-
istration. 
Eunice Lee is not only an excellent 
lawyer, with sound judgment and a ju-
rist’s temperament, but she brings the 
kind of legal experience that is all too 
rare on the Federal bench. Ms. Lee 
spent her entire career in public serv-
ice, representing criminal defendants 
who could not afford counseling. Once 
confirmed, she will be the only former 
Federal defender among the active 
judges on the Second Circuit. 
When I met her, I saw what a caring, 
compassionate, thoughtful woman she 
was, and I was so glad—so glad—to rec-
ommend her to the White House, who 
quickly agreed and has sent her name 
forward. 
Perhaps the highest compliment paid 
to Ms. Lee came from a group of over 
70 former Federal prosecutors from 
New York. These are the folks who 
most often found themselves on the op-
posite side of Ms. Lee in a courtroom. 
They called her a ‘‘brilliant, accom-
plished advocate, who is supremely 
well qualified to serve on the bench.’’ 
She is a model. She is a model in di-
versity. You know, we don’t have very 
many people of color on our Second 
Circuit Court of Appeals. I am trying 
to increase that with the nomination 
of Ms. Lee—Ms. Perez as well. Not only 
is she from a diverse background demo-
graphically, but she is diverse profes-
sionally. To have someone who has 
been a Federal defender up there on the 
Second Circuit will really expand the 
breadth and width and depth of knowl-
edge that that bench has. 
So I am proud to have recommended 
her, and I am looking forward to con-
firming this nominee later this week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5793 
August 4, 2021 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
morning, 
the 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee considered a first partial batch 
of government funding bills for next 
year. 
I want the Senate to secure bipar-
tisan appropriations through the reg-
ular process. I want us to fund the gov-
ernment in an orderly fashion just like 
the successful Appropriations Com-
mittee work we saw throughout Repub-
licans’ recent years in the majority. 
We accomplished that because we 
built a truly bipartisan process. Impor-
tantly, it began at the beginning. Early 
in the calendar year, we convened bi-
partisan talks to produce top-line num-
bers so the appropriators would have 
actual targets. That let good-faith bi-
partisan conversations happen at the 
subcommittee and committee levels 
throughout the spring and summer, 
and we got results on a bipartisan 
basis. 
Unfortunately, this year, our Demo-
cratic colleagues haven’t done any-
thing like that. Either our colleagues 
don’t have any big-picture plan or they 
are privately working off the Presi-
dent’s partisan budget request. There 
has been no big-picture, bipartisan con-
versation. The Democrats didn’t even 
let the committee vote on top-line al-
locations, which normally happens at 
the start of a markup. 
Our colleagues’ fixation on far-left 
shiny objects is distracting them from 
basic governance. They are more fo-
cused on ramming through another 
reckless, 
inflationary 
taxing-and- 
spending spree than ensuring we avoid 
a stalemate over government funding. 
Now, look, I understand and I appre-
ciate that Senators on both sides have 
worked hard to develop appropriations 
titles with a lot of good content. The 
problem is bigger picture. When it 
comes to floor consideration, we can-
not and will not start planting indi-
vidual trees before we have bipartisan 
consensus on the shape of the forest. 
Here is what it will take to get a 
Senate appropriations process back on 
track, two—two—simple things. 
No. 1, Democrats will need to honor 
the longstanding bipartisan truce that 
provides parity for defense and non-
defense spending growth—parity for de-
fense 
and 
nondefense 
spending 
growth—and at a responsible overall 
number that we can all accept. Our 
men and women in uniform and the Na-
tion they defend deserve better than a 
budget that cuts our national defense 
after inflation and allows adversaries 
to get an edge. 
No. 2, we must have agreement that 
we are going to keep longstanding bi-
partisan policy riders in and new poi-
son pill riders out. We need to keep 
foundational mainstays, like the Hyde 
amendment, right where they are, and 
neither side should throw new wrench-
es into the process. 
Parity for national and border secu-
rity and a bipartisan deal on policy rid-
ers—this is not rocket science; it is a 
roadmap. We all know it very, very 
well. That is what it will take to move 
bipartisan appropriations bills across 
this floor, but the majority is behind 
on the homework. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Now, Mr. President, on a totally dif-
ferent matter, in April, when President 
Biden announced his intention to pull 
U.S. forces out of Afghanistan, he said 
it was ‘‘time to end the forever wars’’— 
‘‘time to end the forever wars,’’ said 
President Biden, but at every stage of 
the rushed and rudderless retreat that 
has followed, the Biden administra-
tion’s wishful thinking hasn’t come 
within a country mile of reality. By 
any account, the situation in Afghani-
stan has become worse as we have 
headed to the exits, and we will live 
with the security, humanitarian, and 
moral consequences for years to come. 
This whole debacle was not only fore-
seeable; it was, in fact, foreseen. Re-
member what top national security ex-
perts were saying around the time the 
President announced his decisions: 
The Taliban is likely to make gains on the 
battlefield, and the Afghan Government will 
struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the co-
alition withdraws support. 
Administration officials shrugged it 
off. They downplayed the chances that 
Afghanistan’s 
pro-American 
govern-
ment would fall to the pro-terrorist 
Taliban, but now that outcome appears 
all but inevitable. 
The administration literally glossed 
over the risk of an al-Qaida resurgence, 
but now Secretary Austin is acknowl-
edging al-Qaida could reestablish a safe 
haven and threaten the homeland in 
less than 2 years—that is the Secretary 
of Defense—and even that could be op-
timistic. 
They insisted that over-the-horizon 
operations would be enough to keep 
terrorists in check, but now, just as the 
CIA Director warned from the start, in-
telligence gathering is already suf-
fering. 
The administration claimed that re-
sources tied up in the fight against ter-
rorists were more urgently needed to 
counter Chinese aggression, but now 
the manpower demands of this over- 
the-horizon approach have required re-
deployment of forces to the Middle 
East and pulled an entire carrier group 
away—away—from China’s backyard so 
it can conduct costlier, less-efficient, 
long-range missions over Afghanistan 
from the Gulf. 
Much of the rhetoric from the Presi-
dent’s team has sounded almost laugh-
ingly—laughingly—naive. 
The 
Sec-
retary of State publically suggested he 
thinks he can bribe the Taliban into 
being a responsible, peaceful regime 
with diplomatic carrots. So that is 
where we are. 
In 6 months, this administration has 
taken us from helping local partners 
fight the Taliban to abandoning our 
partners and pretending that a future 
Taliban government will care about 
foreign assistance and being accepted 
by the so-called international commu-
nity. 
The Taliban have already begun pav-
ing their way to Kabul with innocent 
blood. Al-Qaida is already rebuilding 
capabilities to strike at our homeland. 
So what on Earth are we doing here? 
What are we doing? 
Surely, the administration would not 
consider the fall of Kabul a success. 
Surely, it will not look at the fate 
awaiting Afghan women and girls and 
say: Mission accomplished. Surely, a 
terrorist resurgence or the assassina-
tion of our Afghan partners cannot 
look to President Biden’s team like a 
‘‘deliberate’’ or ‘‘responsible’’ exit from 
Afghanistan. 
But these are the predictable results 
of these terrible decisions: the con-
sequences of making enormous changes 
with no real plan to mitigate the risk; 
the failure to learn from similar mis-
takes, like the disastrous withdrawal 
from Iraq back in 2011. 
Here in the Senate, it is curious to 
see that some of our colleagues who are 
the most exercised—the most exer-
cised—about trying to undo authoriza-
tions for the use of military force are 
somehow also among the quietest—the 
quietest—when it comes to the unfold-
ing disaster in Afghanistan and over-
sight of ongoing conflicts. 
Make no mistake, whether America 
is on the ground or over the horizon, 
the war in Afghanistan will continue, 
and Americans will not be safer with 
the Taliban ruling from Kabul. 
We will not be safer when al-Qaida 
regains a safe haven and inspires a new 
generation of global jihadists. And we 
won’t be safer when coalition partners 
doubt they can trust our word. 
A strategic disaster is what we are 
witnessing from top to bottom, and a 
growing risk that this war will end in 
a victory—a victory—for the Taliban 
and al-Qaida and become a greater 
threat to the United States. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TRIBUTE TO NICK ROSSI

typically get the spotlight. When we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5794 
August 4, 2021 
Members who introduced and pushed 
for the bill. You don’t usually hear 
about the staffers. 
But none of us in Congress works 
alone. We are supported by dedicated 
staffers who spend long days and often-
times nights and weekends working to 
serve our constituents and our country. 
Today, I want to talk about one of 
those staffers, my whip office chief of 
staff who is leaving the Hill after 26 
years of government service. 
Nick Rossi has been with me since 
2013, when I became the ranking mem-
ber of the Commerce Committee. He 
came on as deputy staff director and 
took over as staff director 2 years 
later. 
There isn’t one thing that we did in 
my years as Commerce ranking mem-
ber and chair that wasn’t at least par-
tially owing to Nick Rossi: the 2018 
FAA reauthorization; the FAST Act; 
Coast Guard legislation; FCC bills; 
broadband legislation; spectrum legis-
lation; section 230 reform legislation, 
known as SESTA-FOSTA; legislation 
to reduce the number of annoying 
robocalls; other consumer protection 
legislation like the FTC Consumer 
Fairness Review Act; legislation to ad-
vance 5G; and the list goes on. 
Nick came to my staff after an al-
ready illustrious career on the Hill. He 
had served as chief counsel at the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, as chief 
counsel and chief investigator on the 
Commerce Committee, and as staff di-
rector on the Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee. 
But his career in government started 
much earlier. He actually started his 
government service in the FBI, apply-
ing on a whim when he couldn’t join 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office because of a 
hiring freeze. 
As is typical for Nick, he graduated 
first in his class at the FBI Academy 
and then went on to spend 11 years in 
the FBI as a special agent, a super-
visory special agent, unit chief, asso-
ciate legal counsel, and media spokes-
person. 
That sounds like a lot for 11 years 
but not so much when you know Nick. 
I mentioned that he graduated first 
in his class at the FBI Academy. He 
also graduated with honors from Notre 
Dame and from Harvard Law School, 
where he was in the drama society with 
our colleague TED CRUZ. 
I don’t think I have ever asked Nick 
about any issue and gotten anything 
less than a thoroughly informed an-
swer, whether the subject was tech-
nically in his area of expertise or not. 
I will never forget when he accom-
panied me and former Senator Bill Nel-
son to the Sanford Underground Re-
search Facility in Lead, SD. This is a 
lab where scientists are conducting re-
search in particle physics and the ex-
pansion of the universe. So it is pretty 
complicated stuff. 
Well, apparently not to Nick. He was 
in the car with us, and he was throwing 
out technical formulas and the finer 
points of physics and cosmology with 
the ease he might use when discussing 
the lunch menu in the Dirksen cafe-
teria. 
When asked how he knew all this 
stuff—he definitely didn’t major in 
physics, and space wasn’t his issue 
area—he just said it was a hobby. Trust 
Nick to be flirting with particle phys-
ics as a hobby. 
But while Nick may often be the 
smartest person in the room, he is also 
the most humble. He is often the last 
to speak. He listens. He asks questions, 
sometimes maybe when he doesn’t real-
ly need to. And he gives thoughtful, 
wise counsel. 
It has been clear over the last few 
days as staffers across the Senate 
learned that Nick was leaving just how 
respected his voice is in the Senate. 
I have had more than one committee 
staff director talk to me about how he 
or she learned to run a committee from 
Nick. 
And I know a lot of senior staffers— 
inside my office but outside of it as 
well—who will tell you that when they 
are facing a challenge, the first person 
that they go to to provide a sounding 
board is Nick. 
And Nick always makes himself 
available. He is uniformly generous 
with his time and knowledge, and he 
treats everyone the same, whether the 
individual in question is a staff assist-
ant or a chief of staff. 
He has brought out the best in every 
team I have seen him work with, 
whether at the Commerce Committee 
or in the whip office. 
Nick has been chief of staff in my 
whip office for 2 years—2 very eventful 
years. Through it all, Nick has been a 
steady presence in the whip office and 
in the Senate. No matter the crisis, 
Nick is calm and collected, and he in-
spires that calm in others, although I 
do hear that it is a different story 
when he is watching Notre Dame foot-
ball. The word is that there is a lot of 
ranting, pacing, and yelling at the TV, 
but I have not observed that. 
Above all, Nick is a character guy, 
which matters a lot to me. He is a man 
of honor, integrity, and principle. 
I never have to worry that Nick is 
going to cut corners or bend the rules. 
He is always going to do things the 
right way, and there is nothing more 
important than that. 
I can’t talk about Nick without also 
mentioning his commitment to his 
family. His pride in his kids always 
shines through, and just as he is never 
too busy to talk to a staffer who is 
having a problem, he is always ready to 
take a break from his work to help his 
daughter Elena with her math home-
work—another 
subject 
Nick 
didn’t 
major in but is, of course, really good 
at—or to build swords and helmets and 
bows and arrows with his son Johnny. 
I am very grateful to his wife Kath-
erine and to Elena and Johnny for 
sharing him with us for all these years. 
And I am very happy that there are 
fewer late nights in his future so that 
he can get in some more time with his 
family. 
I realize that Nick may be starting to 
sound a little superhuman here, so let 
me just say that while he is a man of 
many talents who has not only not suc-
cessfully repaired the family’s micro-
wave and dishwasher but is also known 
for building a balloon arch in the shape 
of a shark for his kids’ school, I am re-
liably informed that he is not a good 
cook. 
And I am pretty sure that ‘‘not’’ was 
bold and underlined. 
But, seriously, Nick is one in a mil-
lion, and it has been my privilege to 
have him lead the team in the whip of-
fice. 
His absence will be sorely felt by me, 
by my staff, and throughout Capitol 
Hill, and I hope he won’t mind the oc-
casional phone call to pick his brain on 
some of the issues that are facing the 
Senate. 
Nick, thank you for your service, and 
God bless you in all your future under-
takings. Wherever you land next, they 
will be lucky to have you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, infrastruc-
ture is the physical backbone of our 
country, and it is an example of posi-
tive, constructive American achieve-
ment and accomplishment. 
Unfortunately, this particular bill, in 
its process, content, pricetag, and long- 
term effects, simply will not serve the 
country, Americans, and particularly 
Utahns well. It will ultimately be det-
rimental to our economy, to the daily 
lives of the American people, and even 
in some cases the infrastructure itself. 
Now, I am not saying I don’t appre-
ciate the hard work, goodwill, and ex-
cellent intentions of my colleagues 
who put many long hours, weeks, and 
months into crafting it; nor am I sug-
gesting that there aren’t good things in 
the bill, good things that would benefit 
deserving people in this country. 
As I have said before, the question is 
not whether or not infrastructure is a 
good and a necessary thing; nor is the 
question whether the bill contains 
some good things. 
The question is, rather, how much 
should the Federal Government be in-
volved in infrastructure? And if it 
should, where it should. How much 
should it be spending on it? 
The truth is the particulars of this 
bill take the scope far beyond what 
should be under the realm of the Fed-
eral Government, under the domain of 
the Federal Government, specifically 
at a price far beyond what we can af-
ford and at a time when we are already 
far into feeling the sting of inflation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5795 
August 4, 2021 
There is a reason that our Founding 
Fathers reserved ‘‘numerous and in-
definite’’ powers to the States while 
providing ‘‘few and defined’’ powers to 
the Federal Government. Article I, sec-
tion 8 of the Constitution literally lists 
the particular powers given to Con-
gress. It tells us what they are. And 
you will notice that infrastructure gen-
erally is not one of them. 
Now, in some cases it does make 
sense that the Federal Government is 
involved in some infrastructure. The 
Interstate Highway System is a good 
example of that. Postal roads, also spe-
cifically accounted for in article I, sec-
tion 8, are another example of that. 
This bill, however, includes things 
like bike paths and beautification 
projects, mass transit systems, surface 
roads, roads that start and stop in one 
State and are not part of the Interstate 
Highway System—things that, while 
good and lovely and useful, are a far 
cry from what the Federal Government 
can and should reasonably and success-
fully oversee. What is more, it does so 
at an enormous pricetag, one that will 
dig us even deeper and deeper into debt 
at the expense of the American people, 
both now and further down the road. 
Now, proponents of the bill insist, 
and will continue to insist as we debate 
this, that the bill is paid for. But, in 
fact, despite the staggeringly large 
amount of money that it spends—esti-
mated to be $1.2 trillion in total, the 
largest amount for a package of this 
kind in history by far—it still does not 
have a score from the Congressional 
Budget Office. 
Normally we don’t vote on, much less 
pass, something like this without a 
CBO score. We don’t have one. And I re-
gret to say that many of the so-called 
pay-fors amount to flimsy budget gim-
micks that, in reality, do no such thing 
as pay for the bill. 
So what are these so-called pay-fors? 
Well, let’s take the new reporting re-
quirements on cryptocurrency, for ex-
ample, which would allegedly bring in 
$28 billion. Everything about this pay- 
for is half-baked and unclear. 
How exactly will additional revenue 
reporting generate new tax revenue? 
And how can you possibly apply stock 
exchange-style reporting requirements 
to something so different and decen-
tralized as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and 
other cryptocurrencies? 
At best, this revenue gimmick will 
fail. At worst, it will hamper financial 
innovation for decades to come. 
Take the mandated sales of oil from 
the 
Strategic 
Petroleum 
Reserve, 
which the bill sponsors claim will 
produce $6 billion in revenue starting 7 
years from now. But do we realistically 
know what the demand for oil might be 
at that time or what can happen in the 
meantime when we might need to use 
oil in this Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve? 
What happens when we get 5 years 
down the road and Congress determines 
that we should hold onto the oil a bit 
longer until we might be able to gen-
erate more revenue from the sale? 
What if even more of these sales are 
congressionally 
mandated 
in 
these 
years, essentially flooding the market 
and causing the price of that same oil 
to crash? 
Take the pension smoothing compo-
nent of the bill, which would only 
cause us to lose more money in the 
long-term and simultaneously threaten 
the solvency of retirement benefits— 
the retirement benefits of millions and 
millions of American workers. 
Take the rebate rule delay, which so 
far has never, and may never, go into 
effect. Delaying something that has no 
set time for implementation cannot re-
alistically be predicted to produce $49 
billion in savings. 
Take the $20 billion in future spec-
trum auctions. While spectrum auc-
tions can certainly produce a great 
deal of revenue, this possible future 
auction may end up never happening. 
It could have significant restrictions 
on it due to the dynamics of adjacent 
bands, or it could simply produce far 
less than we are being asked to assume 
today. 
Finally, take the claim of $205 billion 
in unused COVID funds. Upon further 
investigation, it includes only roughly 
$50.2 billion of unused COVID funds as 
a real pay-for. 
The other $150 billion is simply 
spending that didn’t happen because 
the country began to emerge from the 
pandemic. Many States ended the en-
hanced unemployment benefits that 
were keeping more people out of work, 
and other States, local communities, 
businesses, and families didn’t require 
as much Federal spending, thanks to 
their own successes and their own re-
siliency. 
In other words, this other $150 billion 
is not a pay-for. It is fake. It is simply 
spending or lost revenue that was 
never realized. And whether this bill 
passes or not, this $150 billion will 
never be realized. 
No, the numbers for these pay-fors do 
not add up. The math for this bill is 
faulty, to say the least. What is more, 
much of the massive amount that it 
will be spending will not even be effi-
cient or effective spending on infra-
structure. Even if this were the role of 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
then 
we 
ought to make sure that it spends 
those funds efficiently and effectively. 
But, unfortunately, the fact of the 
matter is that along with Federal dol-
lars come a whole host of Byzantine 
laws and regulations that prevent pre-
cisely that, including restrictions im-
posed by everything from NEPA to the 
Davis-Bacon Act. 
The Davis-Bacon Act artificially in-
flates labor prices by requiring that all 
federally funded construction projects 
worth more than $2,000 pay workers at 
least the prevailing wage rate on non- 
Federal projects in the same locality. 
And it has substantially driven up the 
cost of Federal projects, hindered eco-
nomic growth, wasted taxpayer dollars, 
and hurt unskilled laborers each year. 
In fact, it is estimated that repealing it 
would save taxpayers $10.7 billion over 
10 years. 
NEPA has imposed similar burdens 
and costs. Signed into law in 1970, it 
was intended to account for the envi-
ronmental consequences of proposed 
Federal actions or projects. But over 
the last 50 years, it has substantially 
deviated from its original purpose, 
morphing into a complex, bureaucratic 
labyrinth; stalling projects from frivo-
lous lawsuits and bureaucratic delays; 
and dramatically increasing the cost 
and 
timeline 
of 
their 
completion. 
Sometimes this law stretches projects 
that should take a couple of years to 
complete into decades. 
At the very least, we ought to reform 
these costly, ineffective regulations— 
and do so drastically—so that Federal 
infrastructure can be completed better 
and faster, which is exactly what I pro-
posed in the amendment that I put be-
fore this body yesterday. 
But this bill, in its current form, is 
ultimately not good for Utahns, and it 
is not good for the American people. 
Driving more Federal money into in-
frastructure, unfortunately, means we 
will pay more to build less. We will be 
paying more to build less. It means less 
money going to steel and concrete in 
the ground, and a whole lot more going 
to 
lawyers, 
accountants, 
lobbyists, 
compliance specialists, and bureau-
cratic delays. It means longer and 
more expensive projects. 
Now, this varies State by State, but 
in Utah, it is estimated that adding 
Federal dollars to a project increases 
the overall cost by 20 percent—some-
times as much as 40 percent. Not only 
will it mean more expensive projects, 
but more expensive products too. 
Another provision in this bill would 
impose new fees on dozens of chemicals 
used in countless products and con-
sumer goods in our day-to-day lives— 
chemicals found in concrete, wood, 
plastics, 
rubber, 
dyes, 
detergents, 
drugs, and pesticides for food, just to 
name a few. So every time you buy one 
of those products—or almost any prod-
uct, for that matter—you will be pay-
ing a little bit for this. Only it is not a 
tax; it is a fee, and it is hidden from 
your view. So the consumer—the poor 
and middle-class taxpayer—doesn’t see 
a tax increase. They just see that they 
are paying even more for everything 
that they buy. 
Another 
provision 
would 
extend 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s ‘‘g-fees’’ 
for an entire decade. These fees could 
add thousands of dollars to the mort-
gages of home buyers at a time when 
that first home is increasingly out of 
reach for many. Utahns can’t afford 
this. Congress is supposed to be ad-
dressing problems like these, not mak-
ing them worse with sneaky new fees. 
This comes at a time when Americans 
are already feeling the sharp sting of 
snowballing inflation. 
Now, this graph highlights some of 
the problem. It highlights what the 
American people have felt over the last 
12 to 18 months. You will notice a

curve sloping sharply upward. Today, 
inflation is at 5.4 percent, which 
means, on average, the goods you buy 
today are 5.4 percent more expensive 
and the savings you have responsibly 
accrued are actually worth less. 
And don’t forget—the Federal Gov-
ernment’s reckless spending has exac-
erbated this trend. Look at how the red 
has grown, what we see here. The red 
that you see in this chart, these are 
deficits. Look at how it has grown. The 
red portion of the graph is deficit 
spending. 
While we surely needed to spend 
some additional money during the 
COVID pandemic, did we really need to 
spend this much more, to the point 
where we were borrowing a lot more 
than we were taking in? You know, we 
borrowed close to $4 trillion last year. 
Even if you think that we did need to 
spend this much more, wouldn’t we try 
to get our country back on track and 
to discontinue this unfunded spending 
spree that contributes to runaway in-
flation? 
Look, from gas to groceries and from 
homes to healthcare, every day, it is 
getting harder for hard-working Ameri-
cans to afford the basic necessities of 
day-to-day life. Take just a quick look 
here at everyday items. These are not 
luxury items that we associate with 
the elite; these are things that ordi-
nary people purchase every day. Com-
pared to the period of time before the 
pandemic, not so very long ago, just 16 
months ago, eggs are now 13 percent 
more expense; milk is 11.3 percent more 
expensive; chicken breast, 11.3 percent 
more expensive; bread is 9.4 percent 
more expensive; and gas is more than 
27.5 percent more expensive. 
The fact is that packages like this 
one are not without their effects on the 
people we have taken an oath to rep-
resent. At the end of the day, it is the 
American people whose tax dollars we 
take to pay for packages like this. At 
the end of the day, it is the American 
people who will bear the brunt of the 
debt we are forcing upon them. At the 
end of the day, it is the American peo-
ple who will feel the effects in every as-
pect of their daily lives—in their work-
places, their communities, and their 
families—and they should get a say in 
it. 
They certainly shouldn’t have to sign 
on to something that was made known 
to the American people at 10 p.m. on 
Sunday night. Those who drafted this 
legislation had 4 months to review it 
and 4 months to get to know it. The 
American people shouldn’t be asked to 
pass this in 4 days.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today because I note 
the Democrats being so eager to move 
to 
their 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
spree, and it is something I absolutely 
oppose. If we pass a bill of that mag-
nitude, the American people will be 
paying more in taxes, will be paying 
more in the cost of living, and it will 
continue to impact the American peo-
ple in a very negative way. 
Right now, the Senate is debating a 
separate bill, an infrastructure bill, 
and, in fact, the bills are not com-
pletely separate. It would be nice if 
they were, but they are not. The reason 
they are not separate is because NANCY 
PELOSI, the Speaker of the House, has 
made it abundantly clear that any bi-
partisan infrastructure bill that is 
passed here in this Senate won’t see 
the light of day in the House of Rep-
resentatives unless and until, as she 
has said, the Senate also sends her a 
multitrillion-dollar reckless tax-and- 
spending bill. According to one non-
partisan group, that bill could cost up 
to $5.5 trillion over the next 10 years. 
Now, NANCY PELOSI has said time and 
time again that there will not be one 
penny for roads, not one penny for 
bridges, not one penny for airports or 
ports until she gets the reckless tax- 
and-spending bill that she is demand-
ing. It wasn’t a negotiation; it was a 
hijacking. And NANCY PELOSI isn’t just 
a hijacker; she is also an arsonist. 
What she is proposing is going to pour 
jet fuel on the fire of inflation that is 
currently ravaging the country. 
The flame was lit months ago when 
Democrats borrowed $2 trillion under 
the name of COVID relief. But just 
look at the economic projections be-
fore the bill became law. Some people 
failed to predict the inflation. The Fed-
eral Reserve failed to predict it. The 
White House budget office said: Oh, no, 
we won’t get inflation. The Congres-
sional Budget Office said no. There 
were Democratic economists, though, 
who warned that it would happen, and 
Republicans pointed out clearly that it 
was going to happen, and that is what 
has happened now. Democrats refused 
to listen. They borrowed and spent an 
additional $2 trillion, and inflation has 
gone up every month since. 
Core inflation is now the fastest and 
highest it has been in 40 years. Who are 
the victims of this? Well, they are peo-
ple who are on fixed incomes; they are 
seniors; they are working families try-
ing to get by. Now it costs $25 more 
every time you fill up your vehicle 
with gasoline. If you fill up a truck in 
Wyoming, it could be even more than

that compared to the fill-ups of Inau-
guration Day. If you go to the grocery 
store now, it is about $25 more for the 
weekly trip to the grocery store. So 
you are talking $25 extra a week in gas, 
$25 extra a week in groceries; $50 extra 
a week, which comes to $2,500 annually 
for a hard-working family in America 
because of the inflation Joe Biden and 
the Democrats have brought upon us. 
Of course, this kind of inflation slows 
our economic recovery. I just found out 
last week that economic growth is sig-
nificantly below what economists had 
predicted it should be at this point. It 
does seem the Democrats still haven’t 
learned basic economics. Now they 
want to make the same mistake all 
over again, even at a higher level. They 
want to borrow and spend trillions 
more. 
Last week, we found out that the pre-
vious Democratic bill gave $800 million 
to prisoners behind bars. Now, TOM 
COTTON and I came to this floor, and we 
tried to stop the Democrats from giv-
ing our taxpayer dollars to prisoners 
currently behind bars. We specifically 
warned it would happen as stimulus 
checks were sent out around the coun-
try. We tried to stop this as part of the 
Democratic spending bill, but all 50 
Democrats, every one of them sup-
ported direct checks to prisoners be-
hind bars. The senior Senator from Illi-
nois came to the floor and gave a 
speech defending it. He implied it 
would be racist not to give free money 
to people behind bars. 
Every one of the 50 Democrats put 
$800 million of American taxpayer dol-
lars on the credit card and sent checks 
to prisoners behind bars. This means 
more debt and more inflation for law- 
abiding citizens in exchange for money 
to criminals. It tells the American peo-
ple all we need to know about the pri-
orities of the Democratic Party. 
Now Democrats want another round 
of payoffs. This payoff is even more ex-
pensive than the last one. Democrats 
are promising payoffs to all their fa-
vorite groups: climate activists, left-
wing professors, trial lawyers, and 
union bosses. This bill, this reckless 
tax-and-spending bill, includes one lib-
eral priority after another. 
Even as we face the worst border cri-
sis in the last two decades, Democrats 
are now promising amnesty and citi-
zenship and voting rights for millions 
of illegal immigrants. Once they get 
amnesty, then they can get all the 
other Democratic payoffs as well. This 
is going to lead to an additional tidal 
wave of illegal immigration, and all of 
this has a price tag, and someone has 
to pay. 
Democrats tell nice stories, and Re-
publicans do the math. This bill is so 
expensive, the Democrats will have to 
go after every working family in Amer-
ica in order to pay for it. One way or 
another, every working American will 
end up paying for this. There is not 
some rich person who is going to be 
able to pay for all of this. There aren’t 
enough rich people on Earth to pay for 
this level of spending. 
Democrats are going to go after the 
majority of the people in this country, 
and, of course, that is the middle class. 
That is exactly what they intend to do 
with this bill because this bill is going 
to raise taxes on family farms and 
ranches. 
According to the accounting firm 
Ernst and Young, this bill, this spend-
ing bill that NANCY PELOSI is demand-
ing go from the Senate to the House 
before any infrastructure bill is passed, 
would eliminate 80,000 jobs over 10 
years. The bill would raise taxes on 
small businesses, which are already 
struggling to stay open because of 
Democratic policies. Anyone who sells 
their home will pay thousands and 
thousands more in taxes. 
Now, this is also going to include a 
carbon import tax, which will drive up 
prices even higher. 
The bill would be a socialist takeover 
of our economy—more taxes, more 
spending, more debt, more government 
eating into people’s paychecks and eat-
ing into their savings. There is not a 
single Republican in the House or in 
the Senate who is going to support this 
reckless tax-and-spending spree. 
We need to stop this freight train to 
socialism. We don’t have a taxing prob-
lem in this country; we have a spend-
ing problem. Inflation is already high 
enough. We know what the cause is. We 
know it is the cause of the excessive 
Democratic spending, and this is going 
to make it worse. Families across this 
country are struggling right now to 
make ends meet. Family businesses are 
struggling to stay open. It is time to 
stop this reckless tax-and-spending 
spree. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Ari-
zona. 
MAIDEN SPEECH 
Mr. KELLY. Mr. President, it is an 
honor to rise today to deliver my maid-
en speech. 
Nine months ago, the people of Ari-
zona trusted me with a great responsi-
bility: to represent them in the U.S. 
Senate; to do so during a pandemic 
that has challenged every one of us, 
taken loved ones too soon, and bat-
tered our economy; and to fill the re-
maining 
years 
of 
Senator 
John 
McCain’s sixth term. 
Each day since then, I have gone to 
work for the people of Arizona, striving 
to 
fulfill 
that 
responsibility, 
undeterred by the challenges we have 
in front of us because that is what Ari-
zonans have done over the last year 
and a half—protecting their families 
from this virus, keeping themselves 
and their businesses afloat, and look-
ing out for their neighbors. 
Arizonans have faced down this virus 
and the economic fallout that came 
with it with determination. And I came 
here to have their backs and to work 
towards a brighter future for our grow-
ing State because we can’t just rebuild 
our economy the way it was before. We 
have to reinvent it and create the jobs 
of the future, good-paying jobs that 
you can actually raise a family on. It is 
a long to-do list. But, hey, I am used to 
those. 
The checklist for flying the Space 
Shuttle stands about 6 feet tall. The 
Senate, though, is not NASA. It doesn’t 
move as fast. And it is not the U.S. 
Navy, either, where everyone works to-
gether toward a common goal. 
But my wife, Gabby, taught me a 
thing or two about how to listen and 
how to find common ground. Now, she 
loved representing Arizona in Congress, 
and no one works harder than she does. 
Now, neither of us expected that it 
would be me serving here in the U.S. 
Senate. I might have been the astro-
naut, but it turned out that she is the 
one who would nearly lose her life serv-
ing our country. 
I am so proud of her and of her re-
lentless positivity that she brings to 
her continued rehabilitation. It in-
spires me each and every day. I could 
not do this without her support or the 
support of my daughters, Claudia and 
Claire, or my first grandchild, Sage, 
who was born in May. Maybe, I am not 
so sure about her support; she is only 2 
months old. 
But in my first days here, I spoke to 
Republicans and Democrats to work on 
emergency COVID relief. For so many 
Arizonans, the relief we got passed was 
a lifeline—the difference between bank-
ruptcy and keeping the lights on, be-
tween losing their small business and 
paying their employees. I have heard 
that countless of times as I have trav-
eled across the State. 
In March, on my 100th day in the 
Senate, I spoke with a group of Arizo-
nans to understand how COVID–19 was 
impacting them and their families. One 
of those conversations really stuck 
with me, and I want to take a second to 
tell you about Susana Andrade. 
Prior 
to 
the 
pandemic, 
Susana 
worked in a school cafeteria in South 
Phoenix. Her husband worked as a 
landscaper. When the pandemic spiked 
in Arizona, her husband’s work slowed 
down 
and 
the 
school 
closed. 
But 
Susana and her coworkers kept going 
to work. The school was continuing to 
offer meals for pickup for students and 
families who needed them, and a lot of 
them needed these meals. She told me 
that they initially were just offering 
breakfast and lunch, but then they 
added dinner and a snack because the 
demand was just so high. 
Susana and her coworkers knew how 
hard the pandemic had hit the commu-
nity, how many folks were out of work. 
There were students who wouldn’t eat 
if they weren’t there to make the 
meals. So she kept going to work, mak-
ing and packing meals for students and 
their families. 
And, then, in February, she and her 
entire family got sick with COVID. She 
couldn’t go to work for weeks, and she 
and her family struggled to pay their 
bills that month while they tried to re-
cover. 
Now, Susana’s story has stuck with 
me over the last year. Here is a hard-

working Arizona family doing every-
thing right, who just got knocked off 
their feet. At the same time, Susana 
embodies the best of what we saw dur-
ing this awful pandemic: neighbors and 
parents making tremendous sacrifices 
to help one another get through this. 
I spoke to Susana recently. She told 
me that days after we spoke in March, 
she and her family received their stim-
ulus checks, and it made such a big dif-
ference in their lives. But she is still 
now living paycheck to paycheck, 
working two jobs, trying to provide for 
her family to just get ahead. 
I understand that. Growing up, my 
mother worked both as a secretary and 
a waitress at the same time. When my 
brother and I were in middle school, 
she decided to become a police officer, 
like my dad. But she had to pass this 
physical fitness test, which was de-
signed for men. But my mother was not 
discouraged. She wasn’t discouraged by 
that or by the fact that, if she would 
pass, she would become one of the first 
female police officers in our home 
town. In fact, I think she liked that. 
That was my mom for you. 
But I knew that she believed that the 
increased and steady salary would help 
our family. My mother wanted to give 
my brother and me every opportunity 
to succeed. She showed us what we 
could achieve by having a goal and a 
plan and working hard at it. 
I am here because of a good public 
education and because of the oppor-
tunity that my parents created for me 
to serve our country and pursue my 
dreams. But for so many families, it is 
becoming harder to get ahead, and the 
pandemic only made this more dif-
ficult. Businesses shuttered, savings 
drained, and debt and bills piled up. 
What every parent wants—what my 
mom wanted—is to be able to work 
hard and give their children a future 
filled with opportunity. 
That is why the most important re-
sponsibility we have here is not just to 
rebuild our economy but to reinvent it 
for the future. And doing that starts 
with 
infrastructure: 
roads, 
bridges, 
water, the power grid, high-speed inter-
net. And it is not just in big cities but 
in rural and small towns, in smalltown 
Arizona and Tribal communities. That 
is the item on our checklist now. 
Arizona is facing a severe drought 
that requires us to improve our water 
infrastructure and increase or resil-
iency. 
Schoolbuses on the Navajo Nation 
cost three times as much to maintain 
because so many of the roads are un-
paved. 
I–10, which runs through the center 
of our State, between Tucson and 
Phoenix, has not been expanded in 
years. A signal accident can cause 
delays for hours. That happens almost 
every day. 
It is clear that Arizona will benefit 
from upgrading and modernizing our 
infrastructure. That is why, for the 
past few months, I have been working 
with a group of Republicans and Demo-
crats to come to an agreement on a 
historic investment in our infrastruc-
ture. I advocated for Arizona’s prior-
ities, and we worked together to find 
common ground and work out our dif-
ferences. And now we are on the verge 
of passing it. 
This is going to fix roads and bridges, 
improve Tribal water and transpor-
tation infrastructure, expand afford-
able high-speed internet access, and 
make 
Arizona 
more 
resilient 
to 
drought and wildfires. 
I have been determined to deliver 
these infrastructure investments that 
Arizona needs to continue to grow. We 
want to grow, and we want to attract 
new and innovative companies to our 
State because Arizona’s prosperity de-
pends on continuing to create new, 
high-paying jobs, including growing 
our tech sector. 
Now, one of the biggest success sto-
ries of our growing tech sector is an in-
dustry that actually produces some-
thing physically small, microchips. 
Microchips go in everything, from 
our phones and appliances and cars to 
computers, but also the most sophisti-
cated fighter jets and missile systems. 
There is currently a global shortage 
of microchips, and the truth is, today, 
just 12 percent of them are manufac-
tured here in the United States. It used 
to be 40 percent. Many foreign competi-
tors, including China, are investing 
heavily to try to dominate this indus-
try. 
Now, Arizona does manufacture a lot 
of 
microchips. 
It 
already 
employs 
about 30,000 people in good-paying jobs 
in this industry, and it is poised to 
grow. We recently announced invest-
ment plans from Intel and the Taiwan 
Semiconductor 
Manufacturing 
Com-
pany. Arizona can lead the way as we 
restore more microchip manufacturing 
and development to American soil. 
That is the goal of this $52 billion 
plan that I spent months working on 
with Senators CORNYN and WARNER, to 
create new advanced manufacturing fa-
cilities, or fabs, in places like Arizona. 
I made it my mission to get this passed 
through the Senate because it is impor-
tant. It is important to our economy, 
and it is important to our national se-
curity, ensuring that our supply chain 
for something so critical does not de-
pend on adversaries like China. 
Transformational investments such 
as this will create thousands of high- 
paying jobs, and we got it passed 
through the Senate, Republicans and 
Democrats working together. 
Now, we must continue working on 
this checklist, getting Arizonans the 
skills they need for these new jobs. For 
some, that will mean getting a college 
degree in science or engineering. 
Arizona is home to three world-class 
universities that are leaders in re-
search and innovation. We must con-
tinue to educate the best scientists and 
engineers in the world. That is the only 
way we are going to stay ahead. 
At the same time, we know that 
about a third of students who graduate 
from high school will not pursue a 
4-year degree. Now, that doesn’t mean 
that they can’t be set up for success in 
the 21st century economy, and we need 
to make sure that they are. 
Advanced manufacturing facilities, 
like the microchip fabs that I men-
tioned earlier, for those we need well- 
trained semiconductor processors, and 
we need electricians, and we need 
HVAC technicians. These are good-pay-
ing careers for those who get the skills 
and training that they need. 
And right now, a lot of young Arizo-
nans are getting those skills through 
our community college system. 
At Pima Community College’s down-
town campus in Tucson, they have a 
new Automotive Technology and Inno-
vation 
Center 
that 
I 
visited 
last 
month. Their students are learning 
how to operate the software that auto-
matically controls drills and lathes and 
milling machines and 3D printers and 
other tools. They can be trained not 
just in traditional automotive tech-
nology but in electric vehicles as well. 
Arizona is becoming a center for in-
novative electric vehicle manufactur-
ers. So why shouldn’t we be getting 
these students the skills they need for 
this technology right now? 
Pima Community College’s chan-
cellor, Chancellor Lambert, calls this 
much needed approach ‘‘moving at the 
speed of business.’’ What he means is 
our education system must meet the 
demands of today’s workforce, and that 
has to be the case not just in major 
metro areas but in rural Arizona, as 
well, and in rural America. 
At Yavapai College in Northern Ari-
zona, they just opened a new Skilled 
Trades Center in Clarkdale, where they 
will train a new generation of con-
struction workers and plumbers and 
electricians and HVAC technicians. 
I could not be more impressed with 
Arizona’s community college system. 
Yavapai College is also taking advan-
tage of partnerships with companies to 
set students up with opportunities that 
prepare them to immediately enter the 
workforce in industries like mining. 
Moving at the speed of business, that 
is how we are going to prepare hard- 
working young students to get these 
good-paying jobs. It is also how we are 
going to outcompete and outinnovative 
other countries like China, having a 
talented workforce that can fill the 
jobs of the future and develop cutting- 
edge technologies that are critical not 
just to our economy but to our na-
tional security as well. 
Now, these are issues that I know Re-
publicans and Democrats agree on. 
And even on tough issues, I believe 
that we can also find common ground. 
We have had crisis after crisis at our 
border, each a result of decades of fail-
ure in Washington to adequately ad-
dress border security and fix our bro-
ken immigration system. 
Senator PORTMAN and I have intro-
duced bipartisan legislation that would 
require the Department of Homeland 
Security to finally develop a plan to

handle increases at the border, to take 
the politics out of this, no matter 
which party controls Congress or the 
White House, and to provide dedicated 
funding to carry out that plan and en-
sure a secure, humane process at the 
border. Finding common ground on 
issues like this is hard, but it is impor-
tant. 
Like many of you, like many of my 
colleagues, I spent years admiring the 
way the late Senator John McCain rep-
resented Arizona in the U.S. Senate. 
But my first impressions of John 
McCain were not of him as a Senator 
but of his service in the Navy. He was 
a hero of young naval aviators like 
me—an example of how to serve your 
country honorably and bravely, includ-
ing in the impossible circumstance of 
being shot down and captured. 
His legacy means so much to the 
State of Arizona, and it lives on 
through his children and his wife, 
Cindy, whom I am so grateful to have 
here today in the Gallery. 
Thank you. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
His legacy, it is something that can-
not be matched, but it is what inspires 
me serving in this Senate seat. And it 
is his example of bipartisanship, of 
independence that continues to demand 
more of us. So I am going to continue 
focusing on delivering results, on beat-
ing this virus, and reinventing our 
economy for the future so that hard- 
working Arizonans have every oppor-
tunity to succeed. 
Arizonans sent me here to have their 
backs, and that is what I intend to do. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, there 
are a lot of folks gathering around our 
new Senator from Arizona, congratu-
lating him, commending him on his 
speech. 
I said to him—I am Navy. We have 
got a bunch of military people that 
serve here: Army, Navy, Air Force, Ma-
rines. But in the Navy, when somebody 
does an especially good job, we say 
‘‘Bravo Zulu.’’ And that was an excep-
tional, exceptional address. 
We are delighted to be joined by 
Cindy McCain. 
Before I yield to the Senator from 
Wisconsin for his amendment, the 
theme that we just heard from our new 
Senator from Arizona really focuses on 
preparing, through the groundwork, 
plowing the field in anticipation of cre-
ating jobs. And we do that in a lot of 
ways. He has mentioned a bunch of 
them in terms of technology jobs and 
so forth. 
One of the other ways is what we are 
doing with the legislation before us 
today, and that is investing in our in-
frastructure broadly, not just roads, 
highways, and bridges; not just water-
works; not just broadband; not just 
surface 
transportation. 
All 
of 
the 
above. All of the above. 
So it is a great way to start our day 
today. 
With that, I yield the floor. I think 
the gentleman, our colleague from Wis-
consin, has some comments that he 
may want to make, unless the leader 
wishes to go next. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2245 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak to my amendment that is 
completely germane to the discussion 
of infrastructure. I can’t think of more 
important infrastructure that would 
actually secure our homeland from a 
variety of threats. 
But as I have always said, coming 
from a manufacturing background, the 
first step in solving a problem is admit-
ting you have one, and right now this 
administration is in a complete state 
of denial regarding the crisis that is on 
the border. 
This crisis has been growing. It is not 
a seasonal surge; this is a growing 
problem. This has been a growing prob-
lem, and I have my chart here that 
demonstrates that. 
Here is January. This is when Presi-
dent Biden came into office. You can 
see the enormous surge of the crisis he 
created. Vice President HARRIS went 
down to Central America looking for 
the root cause of this crisis. She only 
would have had to walk into the Oval 
Office and look at President Biden be-
cause President Biden is the root cause 
of this crisis. 
It is his policies, the dismantling of 
successful policies from the previous 
administration that had stemmed the 
flow, that had largely secured our bor-
der until this President took office and 
reversed all that progress. It is a real 
shame. 
Let me just give you the numbers be-
cause you have to describe the prob-
lem. This has been growing. For the 
last 4 or 5 months, in particular, we 
have been averaging, first, almost 6,000 
and now over 6,000 apprehensions per 
day—6,000. In June it was 6,249. In July 
it will probably be over 6,500. There 
have been weeks we believe it is over 
7,000 people per day coming in and 
being apprehended at the border. 
Now, that doesn’t even count the 750 
to 1,000 known got-aways. DHS is 
now—or CPP, at least, is now esti-
mating that is going to result in about 
269,000 people coming into this country 
that we know they came in; we just 
couldn’t catch them. This also doesn’t 
even describe or enumerate how many 
unknown got-aways. 
So, again, the fact of the matter is, 
from January through July, approxi-
mately 1.3 million people have been ap-
prehended coming into this country 
without documentation. About 173,000 
of those individuals have been released 
in the interior, either with a notice to 
appear or, even worse, a notice to re-
port. If you multiply that times 2, that 
is 346,000 people dispersed to all points 
of America. 
DHS, this administration, is not no-
tifying the States, not notifying the 
cities that these individuals, appar-
ently claiming asylum, are coming 
into communities near you. You add 
that to the 269,000 estimated known 
got-aways, that is over 600,000 people 
just this year. That is larger than the 
population in the State of Wyoming. It 
is approaching the population of the 
State of Vermont. 
And, again, this is while we have the 
title 42 restrictions in place. Probably 
about 900,000 people in the first 7 
months had been returned under title 
42. If the administration ends that pro-
gram, imagine the surge. 
Now, there once was a time when se-
curing the border was a nonpartisan 
issue. Senator McCain led the charge. 
In 2006, this body passed, on a vote of 80 
to 19, the Secure Fence Act, which was 
going to build about 700 miles of fence. 
In the end, only 36 miles was double- 
layer fencing; the rest was pretty inef-
fective, as we have seen. 
But voting for that bill was President 
Biden, President Obama, Senator CAR-
PER, Secretary of State Clinton, Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN, Senator SCHUMER, Sen-
ator WYDEN, Senator STABENOW. This 
was a bipartisan effort to secure our 
border. But somewhere between 2006 
and 2021, this has become a partisan 
issue. 
Now, what is absurd is, in the last ad-
ministration, again, we pretty well 
solved 
the 
problem, 
had 
allocated 
about $10 billion to build the fence. It 
has all been contracted. It has all been 
paid for. We have built about 453 miles 
of the 738 miles that was contracted 
for; 285 miles remain unbuilt. 
An exit report by Senator LANKFORD 
shows that we have spent about $2 bil-
lion getting out of those contracts—$2 
billion to not build the wall. It is cost-
ing us $3 million a day just to guard 
the steel fencing that is lying there not 
being used. 
So my amendment is very simple. It 
is very common sense. It says, please, 
let’s recognize fences work. Certainly, 
Congress recognized it when we put a 
double layer around the people’s House 
for a number of months, spent hun-
dreds of millions of dollars on that se-
curity effort. 
So let’s not waste the taxpayers’ 
money. Let’s recognize walls work. We 
need to complete the 285 miles of wall 
that will help secure our border, that 
will help secure our homeland, and 
that will help keep Americans safe. 
It is a very simple amendment. Let’s 
hope it is not a partisan result. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to 
oppose the Johnson amendment. This 
measure would force continued pay-
ment of government contractors to 
build an ill-conceived border wall. 
Most of these funds were never in-
tended for this purpose. More than $10 
billion was redirected from the Depart-
ment of Defense, and these funds were 
intended for military installations and 
functions such as schools for military

children and National Guard equip-
ment. 
The Biden administration is con-
ducting a comprehensive review of 
these contracts, led by the Department 
of Defense and Homeland Security. 
DHS has recently announced that they 
will continue work on certain common-
sense projects on the southern border 
to address life, safety, environmental, 
and operational considerations. These 
decisions will be guided by what is best 
for our national security, not well-con-
nected government contractors prof-
iting off of hard-earned taxpayer dol-
lars. 
We need to move forward with smart, 
bipartisan 
investments 
that 
secure 
both our southern and our northern 
borders, and we must not look back-
ward at the former administration’s 
boondoggle. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on 
the Johnson amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in 
quick response, the prior administra-
tion’s—what the good Senator claimed 
a ‘‘boondoggle’’ worked. 
During this comprehensive review by 
this administration—again, this ad-
ministration is the root cause of this 
problem; they caused this—the problem 
is growing worse. It is not getting bet-
ter. 
Congress, by supporting a double 
layer of fence around this Capitol for 
months, spent hundreds of millions of 
dollars keeping us safe and secure, rec-
ognizes that fencing and walls work. 
Again, this fencing has been paid for. 
This wall has been paid for. Two billion 
dollars will be wasted. Three million 
dollars a day will be wasted. This is 
just common sense, and it will improve 
the security of this Nation. 
And, again, in 2006, this was a bipar-
tisan type of effort. Building 700 miles 
of fence was bipartisan: 80 to 19. It 
should be bipartisan today. I am urging 
my colleagues, let’s finish building this 
wall. Let’s not waste billions of dollars 
in taxpayer money. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate for several minutes on this amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of this amendment. I am the 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Appropriations for Homeland Secu-
rity. The President’s budget request in-
cluded a rescission of $2 billion that 
we, as Members of this body, put, en-
acted, as the gentleman from Wis-
consin has clearly illuminated. 
And, at the same time, we are having 
a tremendous problem at our southern 
border. We all know this. We don’t 
have the July numbers out yet, but we 
know that apprehensions are going to 
be in excess of over 200,000 in 1 month. 
The July numbers also indicate that 
the number of unaccompanied children 
is the largest ever encountered in 1 
month. 
There are currently now over 150 
miles of wall system projects that we 
as Congress legally funded that are 
now in jeopardy of being canceled. 
When you go to the border, you see 
millions of dollars’ worth of steel slats 
lying on the ground that were to be 
constructed until President Biden can-
celed those projects. Do you know who 
else sees those border walls on the 
ground? 
Human 
traffickers. 
Drug 
smugglers. 
I have, as we all have, been to the 
southern border several times. Customs 
and Border Patrol agents have told us 
that a border wall is a necessary part 
of a system to stop the flow of illegal 
immigration and illicit drugs. 
The border wall is infrastructure. It 
is infrastructure to keep America safe. 
It is infrastructure to keep drugs out of 
this country. It is infrastructure to 
control illegal immigration. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
the Johnson amendment to prohibit 
the cancelation of contracts to build 
the border wall. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, over the 
years, I have made any number of trips 
to our Nation’s southern border. I have 
also traveled extensively throughout 
Central America—and sometimes with 
the author of this legislation—with 
many colleagues, Democratic and Re-
publican. One of the people who have 
been to that part of the world more 
than me is a guy who used to serve 
here in the Senate—later, Vice Presi-
dent—and that is our President, Joe 
Biden. 
There is a verse in Scripture in the 
New Testament, Matthew 25, which 
speaks to the least of these, and one of 
the things: When I was hungry, did you 
feed me? When I was naked, did you 
clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you 
get me to drink? When I was a stranger 
in your land, did you welcome me? Did 
you welcome me? 
To the extent we have looked out for 
the least of these, then we have a 
brighter future. 
But anyway, the reason I raise that, 
we have this moral imperative to look 
out for the least of these, and that in-
cludes people who end up on our bor-
ders looking for safe haven. The reason 
why so many people continue to come 
to our borders from Central America— 
especially Honduras, Guatemala, and 
El Salvador—is because they live lives 
in fear; deprived of economic oppor-
tunity and hope; corruption, crime. 
You know, if any of us lived there with 
our families, we would want to get out 
of there, too, and find a place to go to 
with a brighter future. 
As a former chairman of the Home-
land Security Committee, border secu-
rity is enormously important. We need 
secure borders; no question about that. 
There are a whole bunch of force multi-
pliers which help provide more secure 
borders, including barriers—including 
barriers—and I have supported them. 
So has the Senator, who is also a 
former chairman of the committee. We 
have traveled in that part of the world 
together. 
One of the things we fully agree on is 
what I just said. We can spend the 
next, you know, year, 5 years, 10 years 
securing our border. That is important. 
But if we don’t address those root 
causes of why people are coming here, 
10, 20 years from now, they will still be 
coming. They will still be coming. We 
have to be smarter than that. 
This is a shared responsibility; it is 
not all on the United States. I said to 
my colleague from West Virginia, I 
like to use the example of Home Depot, 
which RON JOHNSON, Senator JOHNSON, 
heard me use more than a few times. 
Home Depot—their ad line is ‘‘You can 
do it. We can help.’’ In these countries 
we are getting all this immigration 
flow from, they can do it, but we can 
help. 
One of the things we set up was 
something called the Alliance for Pros-
perity a number of years ago, with 
Democratic and Republican support—I 
think with support of certainly then- 
Vice President Biden and Senator 
McCain, the late John McCain. Among 
the things that we need to focus on and 
we are doing under the Alliance for 
Prosperity are, one, addressing crime 
and violence; two, addressing corrup-
tion; and three, economic hope and op-
portunity. Those are the three buckets. 
We put money in those buckets, the ex-
pectation is that those three countries 
put even more money in those buckets, 
matching us 2, 3, 4, 5 dollars for every 
dollar that we put up. There are other 
countries that we have an expectation 
for them to help. There are private 
businesses; there is an expectation for 
them to help. Nonprofits. There is an 
expectation for all. This is a shared re-
sponsibility. 
As the place where all these illegal 
drugs are coming from, moving those 
drugs through these three countries— 
we have some moral responsibility to 
do something to help the situation 
down there, not just at the border. 
So with that in mind, I am not going 
to support this amendment. But I 
would just note, I always look for com-
mon ground. The author of the amend-
ment knows full well—I have heard 
him talk about it eloquently, about the 
need to go after root causes. For as 
long as we have been working on this 
issue, all those years, we have needed 
to work on root causes, and we still do 
today as well. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I need 
to respond quickly. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
are now 2 minutes equally divided be-
fore a vote on the Johnson amendment. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I need 
to respond quickly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5801 
August 4, 2021 
Senator CARPER was talking about 
root causes. The root cause of the in-
stability—the primary cause of the vio-
lence in Central America is Americans’ 
insatiable demand for drugs. If you 
solve that problem, you solve the root 
cause of the problem, and you won’t 
have the violence. 
But the root cause of this current 
crisis—because it was already solved— 
the root cause of this current crisis is 
President Biden’s policies. President 
Biden is the root cause. So if you want 
to fix this, we can fix it. Secure the 
border. Go back to the policies that 
worked. We are not going to be able to 
fix Central America until we end our 
insatiable demand for drugs. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, col-
leagues, in about 48 hours, about a 
third of the Senate is going to be on an 
airplane heading for Gillette, WY, and 
we are going to go and say goodbye to 
our friend and colleague Mike Enzi. 
I will never forget where I was sitting 
about, I don’t know, 20 years ago as the 
Presiding Officer, and Mike Enzi was 
literally standing almost right where 
you are, talking about the 80–20 rule 
and why they were so successful in the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. Senator Kennedy and 
Mike 
Enzi—Democrat, 
Republican— 
how they were able to find common 
ground and get stuff done: the 80–20 
rule. 
I said to Mike Enzi that day: What is 
the 80–20 rule? 
He said: About 80 percent of the stuff, 
Ted and I agree on, and about 20 per-
cent, we don’t. What we do is we focus 
on the 80 percent where we agree. 
There is common ground here. I 
think that the Senator from Wisconsin 
knows what it is. And I would ask that 
in addition to talking about our dif-
ferences, let’s talk about where we 
agree, and let’s do good work there.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this

Under the previous order requiring 60

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2146 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I offer 
today what should be considered a 
friendly amendment to the broadband 
section of this infrastructure bill. 
Why is it a friendly amendment? 
Because by using the Administrative 
Procedure Act, which my amendment 
would provide, it would save billions of 
dollars in broadband build-out funds. It 
would provide for consumer input, 
stakeholder input, local and State gov-
ernment input into NTIA—the Agency 
that will be in charge of this broadband 
build-out. And also because it will not 
delay the broadband build-out in any 
way. 
Now, as written today, the broadband 
section waives the Administrative Pro-
cedure Act. The Wicker amendment 
would simply strike that waive and 
make the Administrative Procedure 
Act apply to the broadband section as 
it applies to so many big programs that 
are enacted. 
If we pass this amendment, here will 
be the timeline: Let’s assume the 
President doesn’t get around to signing 
this bill until October 1. I would expect 
the President would sign it earlier than 
that, but let’s assume that he does 
that. There will be 30 days of notice, 30 
days of public comment after the no-
tice is published, a review of those 
comments, which could take 30 to 40 
days. At that point the regulations are 
published and, after 30 days, they go 
into effect. 
So by my calculations, assuming the 
President is very, very late in signing 
the bill, the act and the regulations 
under the Administrative Procedure 
Act would be done by February 7. 
Now, what we all know—what every-
one in this Chamber knows—is that we 
have to wait on the FCC maps, and 
they will not be ready until the ear-
liest—until the earliest—by spring of 
next year, and that is—that is very, 
very optimistic. 
So we have time to do it right, to get 
public input, to have people who have 
already experienced this come to the 
Agency and say: You might want to do 
it this way; or: You might want to 
avoid doing it that way because here is 
our experience. 
We did this one time before, and it 
was only $4.7 billion. This is $42 billion. 
That was the BTOP program, which 
was enacted in 2009. 
We skipped this. We gave it to an 
Agency which is going to have it this 
time, the NTIA—a staff of only 157 peo-
ple—to monitor back then $4.7 billion; 
this time it is $42 billion. 
Here is what we learned about the 
BTOP program, which is an awful lot 
like this one: When Congress asked 
NTIA to administer this, the results 
were deeply troubling. 
Let me quote the inspector general, 
let me quote the Stanford Institute for 
Economic Policy, and the Phoenix Cen-
ter. Their own inspector general found 
that the Agency faced significant chal-
lenges in managing the size and com-
plexity of the program. It is a program 
a tenth the size of what we are talking 
about today. 
The Stanford Institute said NTIA’s 
mechanism for selecting projects was 
incoherent. NTIA, had they adopted 
more a reasonable framework, many 
more households could have been con-
nected with the same money, or the 
same number of connections could have 
been realized for a fraction of the cost, 
because they didn’t do what I am advo-
cating today. 
The Phoenix Center, an independent 
think tank, said they found no positive 
effect on home broadband adoption 
from the BTOP program. 
My fellow colleagues, years from 
now, when someone realizes we have 
wasted billions of dollars on this build- 
out, I would want, and I think my col-
leagues would want, to say: Well, I 
voted yes on the Wicker amendment to 
take the extra 130, 140 days to hear 
what went right and what went wrong 
in the past and to make sure we get it 
right. 
No Senator has worked harder than I 
have on broadband build-out. I want 
this program to succeed. This is a way 
to make sure we spend the money cor-
rectly, to make sure we do it right. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD an 
article dated August 3, just yesterday, 
from the National Journal. 
It 
says: 
‘‘How 
$65 
billion 
for 
broadband infrastructure could fall 
short.’’ 
I ask unanimous consent that it be 
printed in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5802 
August 4, 2021 
[From the National Journal, Aug. 3, 2021] 
HOW $65 BILLION FOR BROADBAND 
INFRASTRUCTURE COULD FALL SHORT 
(By Brendan Bordelon) 
The $65 billion set aside for high-speed 
internet in the Senate’s bipartisan infra-
structure deal is just a small piece of the 
bill’s $550 billion in new spending. But don’t 
call the plan unambitious. 
‘‘It’s the biggest broadband bill in the his-
tory of the country,’’ said Gigi Sohn, a fel-
low at the Georgetown Law Institute for 
Technology Law & Policy and a former 
Democratic official at the Federal Commu-
nications Commission. 
‘‘Would I have preferred more money for 
deployment? Yeah,’’ said Sohn. ‘‘I would like 
to see $100 billion rather than $65 billion. But 
this is a bipartisan bill, and I think that is 
super important to remember and appre-
ciate.’’ 
Some of those billions are earmarked for a 
tribal 
connectivity 
fund, 
‘middle-mile’ 
broadband deployments rural telemedicine, 
distance learning, and other discrete provi-
sions. 
But 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
Senate’s 
broadband infrastructure deal is a $42 billion 
pot of money for state and territorial gov-
ernments, which will have to convince Wash-
ington that their plan to build out high- 
speed internet to rural and underserved re-
gions will work before receiving federal 
grants. 
But there’s a catch. While that money will 
be set aside immediately after the legisla-
tion is signed into law, the bill stipulates 
that no funds can be sent to states until 
after the FCC fixes its much-maligned set of 
national broadband maps showing where cov-
erage exists and where it doesn’t. 
The latest FCC estimate suggests that 
around 14.5 million Americans now live in re-
gions without access to broadband. But other 
estimates have come in much higher, and the 
persistence of inaccurate maps means no one 
really knows for sure. 
Lawmakers and policy experts alike had 
mulled whether it made sense to move ahead 
on broadband funding despite not knowing 
how much money is needed or where to put 
it. In the end, however, the increasing impor-
tance of high-speed-internet access in a pan-
demic-stricken 
world—and 
the 
unlikely 
chance that Congress can summon the en-
ergy and bipartisanship needed to address 
the question at a later date—pushed the Sen-
ate to act. 
‘‘To wait would make the perfect be the 
enemy 
of 
the 
very 
good,’’ 
said 
John 
Horrigan, a senior fellow at the Benton Insti-
tute for Broadband and Society. ‘‘If you’re 
going to not act until you have the best 
data, it’s going to take a long time for you 
to act.’’ 
The FCC will not say when it expects to 
finish the new, more accurate maps. But so 
far the commission hasn’t even completed 
the necessary procurement and contracting 
efforts. And most telecom experts believe 
the maps won’t be ready for prime time until 
next year at the earliest. 
‘‘It’s going to be a couple of years before 
really substantial amounts of money start 
being dug into the ground and strung up on 
telephone poles,’’ said Doug Brake, the direc-
tor of broadband and spectrum policy at the 
Information 
Technology 
and 
Innovation 
Foundation. 
A lack of accurate maps could further slow 
broadband deployment by making it hard for 
states to formulate their own plans. Even 
once the FCC maps are completed, it will 
take time for state governments to digest 
their findings, determine where and how to 
spend federal dollars, and submit those plans 
to Washington for approval. 
Some states are taking matters into their 
own hands. In 2020, Georgia partnered with 
LightBox, 
a 
commercial 
real-estate-data 
provider, to publish their own statewide 
broadband map. And there’s a surge of inter-
est from other states—Pennsylvania and 
Maine are already working on their own 
maps, and Caroline Stoll, the head of sales 
and strategic partnership at LightBox, said 
the company is in talks with several more 
states looking to replicate Georgia’s map. 
‘‘It is a very, very good use of time and re-
sources by the states to develop their own 
map,’’ said Sohn. 
Beyond a lack of maps, there are other po-
tential pitfalls in the Senate’s plan to fund 
broadband infrastructure. Recent efforts by 
the federal government to finance high- 
speed-internet projects have been conducted 
through reverse auctions run by the FCC. 
The new plan puts individual states in 
charge of their buildouts, allowing for great-
er experimentation with funding structures 
and broadband technologies—states can de-
cide whether to pursue primarily wired or 
wireless options, for example. But it could 
also open the door to overbuilding and waste. 
Scott Wallsten, the president of the Tech-
nology Policy Institute, said the decision to 
put states in the driver’s seat ‘‘is going to 
tremendously reduce the efficiency of the 
program.’’ 
‘‘The most efficient way to allocate the 
money—the way you get the biggest bang for 
the 
buck—is 
a 
reverse 
auction,’’ 
said 
Wallsten. 
Gregory Rosston, the director of the pub-
lic-policy program at Stanford University 
and a former FCC economist, said he expects 
state efforts will be spotty, with some doing 
a good job of planning buildouts while others 
fall short. He also worried that state 
broadband plans will be ‘‘much more subjec-
tive and subject to influence than a more 
centralized, transparent system.’’ 
And Brake has issues with the $100 million 
minimum that each state is slated to receive 
for high-speed internet. He said that smaller, 
denser states like Connecticut may not need 
that much money to provide complete cov-
erage to its citizens. 
‘‘To get something through the Senate, 
that’s kind of the price of doing business,’’ 
said Brake. ‘‘Everyone’s got to get some-
thing.’’ Still, Brake said the Senate’s infra-
structure deal is a marked improvement 
from recent proposals like the BRIDGE Act, 
which 
would’ve 
ignored 
the 
lack 
of 
broadband maps and divvied up federal funds 
through imprecise metrics like raw popu-
lation and the percentage of rural or low-in-
come citizens. 
‘‘I think it could be potentially more effi-
cient if this was sort of run through a single 
process within the federal government,’’ 
Brake said. ‘‘[But] it’s improved a lot in this 
new version.’’ 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don’t 
want this program to fall short; I want 
it to succeed. This amendment gives us 
a chance to get the money right, to 
take the extra time that we are going 
to have to take anyway to get the 
maps right. It is a good government 
amendment, a friendly amendment, 
and I urge bipartisan adoption of it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, with all 
due respect to my friend from Mis-
sissippi, I don’t consider this a friendly 
amendment. I consider this a major de-
parture from the agreed-upon structure 
of this broadband section of the bill 
that we are talking about. 
This, as we all know, was a heavily 
negotiated bill. There are provisions in 
it that I don’t like. There are provi-
sions in it that I wish were there that 
aren’t there because of the negotiation. 
This provision, which appears inno-
cent, to reinsert the Administrative 
Procedure Act into this process would 
bureaucratize 
the 
process, 
slow 
it 
down, and would not assist in the proc-
ess. 
Here are some points that I think 
need to be made: 
The first is I consider the broadband 
section one of the crown jewels of this 
entire bill. And the fact that it is 
structured in such a way that the 
grants will go to the States and the 
States will decide how best to admin-
ister those programs because of their 
knowledge of their needs in their 
States—yes, they are going to use 
maps—updated maps, I should say— 
from the FCC, but this is, really, a 
State-driven process. 
The Administrative Procedure Act is 
principally a regulatory process, and 
we are not talking about a regulatory 
process here. We are not talking about 
the issuance of a lot of long and de-
tailed regulations. We are talking 
about a grant program to States, and 
so the burdensome administrative re-
quirements of the APA are really not 
necessary in this case because it is not 
a regulatory process. 
There is already significant oversight 
built into the statute. There are 68 
pages that have all kinds of require-
ments for public notice, filing online, 
public disclosure, comment, and in-
volvement of communities of other 
providers, of all of those interested par-
ties in this process. So it is not like it 
is some kind of closed process. 
There is no doubt that this will slow 
down the process. There is no doubt 
that this would restrict the ability of 
the NTIA to tailor programs to fit indi-
vidual States. 
As I said, that is one of the beauties 
of this whole provision, is that it has 
the flexibility to meet the needs of 
States as they define them. It would 
hamper that State flexibility, and it 
would make it more difficult for the 
States to follow through on a timely 
basis to make this tremendously im-
portant. 
Where the Senator and I agree—and I 
know how hard he has worked on this, 
as have I. This is, I think, one of the 
most important things that we can do 
in this bill, to get Americans con-
nected. I don’t need to make that argu-
ment. Everyone in the Chamber knows 
that. 
The other piece, unfortunately, that 
this amendment would do would be en-
able and, in fact, invite lawsuits. There 
would, undoubtedly, be challenges to 
the regulations, challenges to the—if 
indeed the APA said you have got to do 
this by regulation, you are building a 
whole new bureaucratic process, and 
the bill already provides for the kinds 
of protections that the Senator is talk-
ing about. 
So I think this is an unnecessary 
amendment. I certainly, as one of those

who worked on the negotiation of the 
bill, don’t consider it a friendly amend-
ment, and I believe that it is a major 
change in the agreement that would 
not have been agreed to in the negotia-
tion; and I hope my colleagues across 
the aisle who have supported this 
agreement will oppose this amendment 
because it is not something that was in 
the negotiation and it would not have 
been accepted by those who were nego-
tiating it on this side of the aisle. 
So with that, I strongly oppose this 
amendment. It is a—I don’t think I can 
say it. It makes this a bureaucratic 
process that is unnecessary, will only 
slow and impede the distribution of 
these desperately needed funds to con-
nect the people of America. 
I yield the floor.

The amendment (No. 2146) was re-
jected. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Under the previous order, 
there will now be 4 minutes of debate, 
equally divided, prior to a vote relating 
to the Kennedy amendment No. 2210. 
The Senator from the Louisiana. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2210 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
with respect to my amendment, I offer 
it on behalf of myself and Senator CAS-
SIDY. 
The last 18 months have been chal-
lenging for Louisiana. First, there was 
Hurricane Laura. Then there was Hur-
ricane Delta. Then there was Hurricane 
Zeta. The hurricanes alone did about 
$25 billion of damage. Then we had the 
historic freezes. Then we had historic 
flooding. The total amount of damage 
was $47.1 billion. 
My people are tough, but they are 
tired. This amendment would appro-
priate $1.1 billion in community devel-
opment block grants to help my people 
recover. 
I bring you a problem but also a solu-
tion. Thanks to the efforts of Senator 
CANTWELL and Senator SCHATZ and my-
self, 3 years ago, we convinced the FCC 
not to give away the spectrum auction, 
which belongs to the American people, 
and instead to auction it off. There is 
now $80 billion sitting in Treasury. The 
money for these block grants would 
come from that $80 billion in cash. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, we 
all agree that responding to natural 
disasters is a core Federal responsi-
bility. But, unfortunately, this unprec-
edented amendment would take funds 
from 
the 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission’s spectrum auction reve-
nues to pay for disaster relief. 
The spectrum auction revenues my 
colleagues seeks to reallocate are in-
tended to help expand high-speed inter-
net in the United States. All Ameri-
cans, no matter where they live, should 
have access to the 21st century econ-
omy. 
We can’t pick winners and losers 
when it comes to natural disasters. The 
process should be set in law, which is 
something my colleague from Hawaii, 
Senator SCHATZ, has been working on 
for years. 
I support disaster relief, but this is 
not the way to do it. 
My heart goes out to all Americans 
impacted by natural disasters, not just 
those affected by hurricanes but also 
devastating 
wildfires 
and 
flooding 
caused by climate change. I am com-
mitted to ensuring they receive the as-
sistance they need, but we need a com-
prehensive solution. 
I would like to yield time to my col-
league from Maine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. 
COLLINS. 
Madam 
President, 
first, let me offer to work with both 
Senators from Louisiana to secure the 
funding that their State so desperately 
needs, in my capacity as ranking mem-
ber of the Transportation, HUD Appro-
priations Subcommittee. 
Louisiana has been particularly hard 
hit, experiencing three hurricanes al-
most back to back, and, certainly, the 
need for disaster assistance is clear. 
But we also have other States that 
have been affected: Alabama, Cali-
fornia, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Or-
egon, Puerto Rico—a Territory, not a 
State, obviously. But they need help 
too. 
What I would propose is that we work 
together on an emergency disaster sup-
plemental that will take care of all 
these needs, including the needs of the 
people in hard-hit Louisiana. 
I pledge my personal help and sup-
port to both of my colleagues and 
friends from Louisiana to bring this 
about. 
Finally, let me just say, I am sur-
prised that the administration has not 
submitted a request for supplemental 
disaster assistance. And I look forward 
to see— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
has expired. 
Ms. COLLINS. Thank you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5804 
August 4, 2021 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, this amendment is rejected. 
The amendment (No. 2210) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
EVICTION MORATORIUM 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, after 
many weeks of uncertainty and dis-
tress, millions of Americans can—for 
now—let go of the fear of losing their 
homes and the roofs over their head. 
Last night, the Biden administration 
announced a new 60-day Federal evic-
tion moratorium. I certainly support 
that decision. 
I want to thank all those who in-
sisted that we do something, especially 
U.S. Congresswoman CORI
BUSH, of 
Missouri, who knows the trauma, per-
sonally, of being without a home, hav-
ing been a victim of eviction in her 
life. Representative BUSH camped out 
outside on the Capitol steps for 5 
nights. She slept on the steps of this 
building so that some of the most vul-
nerable people in America would be 
able to sleep with a roof over their 
heads while we were made sure the law 
caught up with our intentions. 
I also want to thank my fellow 
Democratic 
Senators, 
especially 
SHERROD BROWN and ELIZABETH WAR-
REN, who pushed for a fair and just so-
lution to avoid what would have been 
an entirely preventable tragedy for 
families who already lost so much in 
this pandemic. 
As many as 11 million Americans 
have fallen behind on their rent during 
this pandemic because of job losses and 
other misfortunes. 
Let me tell you about one of them. 
Patricia Vasquez. She lives in Chi-
cago’s Little Village neighborhood. She 
told her story to the Chicago Sun- 
Times. By the time Patricia Vasquez 
received an email on July 23 telling her 
that she qualified for help from Chi-
cago’s Emergency Rental Assistance 
Program, the gas to her apartment had 
already been cut off because of an over-
due $1,400 bill. She had sold some 
clothes and jewelry to pay the electric 
bill and keep the lights on, and she was 
6 months behind in rent. 
The Federal eviction moratorium 
will enable people like Patricia to 
avoid homelessness while they wait for 
emergency assistance to reach them. 
Between the bipartisan CARES Act 
that Congress passed in December and 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan, Congress has provided State and 
local governments more than $46 bil-
lion in emergency rental assistance to 
help families pay their landlords. Un-
fortunately, many States and localities 
have been slower than expected in get-
ting that money to the people who 
need it. So far, only $3 billion of the $46 
billion has reached tenants and land-
lords. 
To punish renters who have already 
lost so much for delays over which 
they have no control and to evict them 
with the Delta variant tearing the 
country apart would be unfair, uncon-
scionable, and, in many cases, delete-
rious to public health. It would harm 
our efforts to bring this virus under 
control for good. 
Fortunately, in recent weeks, many 
cities and States have made progress in 
getting the help out to the people who 
need it. That includes the city of Chi-
cago and the State of Illinois. 
The CDC’s new eviction moratorium 
is only a first step. It is imperative 
that all State and local governments 
step up their efforts to get Federal re-
lief to the families who need it and the 
landlords as well. This pandemic has 
caused enough pain. Redtape can’t be 
allowed to deepen that pain for every-
one. 
IMMIGRATION 
Madam President, I would like to ad-
dress another issue that comes up on 
the floor quite regularly, usually from 
speeches on the other side of the aisle. 
I heard one of my colleagues in the 
Senate on the Republican side who is a 
personal friend talk about it today— 
and he is not the only one—and it is, of 
course, the issue of immigration. I 
have been involved in this issue for a 
long time. 
I can recall when I was first elected 
to the Senate, I got a phone call from 
Ted Kennedy. He said: I heard you are 
going to be on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
I said: That is right. 
He said: Can I ask you to be a mem-
ber of my Immigration Subcommittee? 
Well, how do you say no to Ted Ken-
nedy, to start with? I was fascinated by 
the invitation. I got involved in the im-
migration debate then and over the 
years. 
At one point, I joined three other 
Democratic Senators and four Repub-
lican Senators—the so-called Gang of 
8—and tried to sit down and fix this 
broken immigration system. We actu-
ally wrote a bill, a good bill. It passed 
here on the floor of the Senate with 68 
votes. 
Senator McCain was one of the con-
tributors to it. Senator Flake of Ari-
zona was also one of them—Senator 
GRAHAM
of South Carolina, Senator 
RUBIO
of Florida, Senator SCHUMER, 
Senator BENNET, Senator MENENDEZ. 
We put our hearts and souls into that 
effort and put it together and brought 
it to the floor of the Senate and it was 
enacted into law. 
Comprehensive immigration reform— 
I should say, it passed the Senate. It 
failed to become enacted into law be-
cause the House of Representatives, 
under Republican control, wouldn’t 
bring it up for debate, let alone a vote. 
That was an unfortunate missed oppor-
tunity. 
It just comes down to this. We have 
not passed a significant immigration 
bill in the United States of America in 
35 years. Everyone but everyone con-
cedes that our immigration system is 
broken. There are parts of it that are 
just fundamentally unfair. There are 
parts of it which do not serve our Na-
tion. There are certain things we ought 
to all agree on, Democrats and Repub-
licans. Let me give you three that I 
think are the starting points. 
First, we need a safe and secure bor-
der. I want to know who is coming into 
America and what they are bringing. In 
the age of terrorism, in the age of 
drugs, I want to know who is coming in 
and what they are bringing. Yes, we 
need border security. 
Secondly, we should never knowingly 
allow a dangerous person to come into 
this country, period. If someone is here 
without legal protected status and 
they are dangerous to us, they are 
gone—no ifs, ands, or buts about it. 
The third point is an important one 
as well. We cannot allow everyone in 
the world who wants to come into the 
United States to arrive tomorrow. It 
just won’t work. We have to have an 
orderly process, and we ought to show 
some caring and humanitarian instinct 
in that process, too, whether it is a ref-
ugee or asylee. These are people who 
desperately need some safe place to be, 
and the United States has often opened 
its doors since World War II to show 
that kind of kindness. Our generation 
should do the same. 
Now, there are those who come to the 
floor and say: Because so many people 
want to come into the United States, it 
is a mistake for us to give anybody 
legal status in this country because it 
is a green light. It is an incentive for 
even more to show up. 
That argument, I think, is not 
strong, and here is why. Each year, the 
orderly legal process in America makes 
1 million new Americans from immi-
grants. It happens every year. These 
people are following the law, every let-
ter of it, to become legal permanent 
residents in America. So to say we are 
going to cut them off and no longer 
allow them to become citizens makes 
no sense. 
Secondly, immigrants are a critical 
part of America. When my farmers 
come to me and tell me how des-
perately they need farmworkers, and 
they don’t have enough immigrants to 
fill them, my natural reaction is, why 
don’t you go to the Americans who live 
near your farms? And they say: Sen-
ator, we do. Nobody wants to do that 
backbreaking work of picking fruit or 
vegetables and all the hard labor that 
goes with it. We need immigrants to do 
it. 
Two million people in our country 
pick our crops, 2.4 million. Did you 
know half of them are undocumented? 
That is a fact. They have come to this 
country and get paid to do the worst, 
hardest work you can imagine. 
Go to a meat processing plant or a 
poultry processing plant—you pick it— 
anyplace in the United States and look 
at the workforce that comes out of 
that gate at the end of the day. The 
majority of them—well, I should say 40 
percent across the Nation—40 percent 
of them are immigrants who are work-
ing in that field; tough, dangerous, hot, 
hard work. They do it because others

aren’t lining up to do it in their place. 
That is part of America today. Immi-
grants are a critical element. 
I might add one other element which 
is timely. Think of all the times we 
tune into the Olympics and look at the 
people who make us just beam with 
pride, with ‘‘USA’’ written across their 
chest on uniforms, who are winning 
these medals and competing on behalf 
of us, the United States, in the Olym-
pics. 
Suni Lee of Minnesota, who is she? 
Well, it turns out that she is a child of 
a Hmong family. The Hmongs, you re-
member from the Vietnam era, were a 
people who were killed because they 
sided with the United States, and they 
were caught in the crossfire of war. 
Many of them settled in the United 
States, many in the State of Min-
nesota. 
Here is this young woman, this 
daughter of refugees who is making us 
so proud as she stands on the podium 
crying her eyes out with ‘‘USA’’ writ-
ten on her uniform, proudly holding 
that gold medal. We cheer her on. 
Yet when it comes to the U.S. Sen-
ate, there are no cheers from some 
quarters. These are immigrants. Many 
people look at them negatively. I am 
not one of those people. 
There has to be a better way. There 
has to be a humane way for us, this Na-
tion of immigrants, for us to be able to 
have a system that is fair, that really 
is based on the three principles I men-
tioned: border security, no dangerous 
persons, and we have got to have an or-
derly process to come up with. 
We are going to see in the next few 
days, I am sure, debate on the budget 
resolution. It is going to be, in some 
part, a debate on immigration policy. I 
am certainly ready for it. I hope my 
colleagues are too. I hope that they 
will keep an open mind to a process of 
creating a new immigration policy in 
America that really reflects our values, 
that is fair to the people who seek to 
be part of our future, and that recog-
nizes the great heritage which the im-
migrants have brought to this country. 
I hope those people who are on the 
other side who don’t feel as I do will 
take the time to meet some of these 
immigrant people. 
Meet my Dreamers. These young peo-
ple who I first started championing 20 
years ago have lived lives in the shad-
ow of doubt for decades. They were told 
they were undocumented; they could be 
deported at any moment; and yet they 
soldiered on. They worked hard. They 
went to school. They have done re-
markable things, becoming doctors and 
nurses and teachers and entrepreneurs 
and even members of our military. 
They are amazing. They never let me 
down. They are just terrific young peo-
ple. I think they deserve a chance to 
become part of America’s future. 
I think they have earned it, and I 
think we ought to have that kind of at-
titude in our minds when we talk about 
the role of immigrants in the future of 
America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
didn’t come to the floor to speak on 
this matter, but listening to the com-
ments of my friend from Illinois about 
the contributions made by immigrants 
to our country, I wholeheartedly agree 
with him about that. 
Really, when I think about immigra-
tion, I think it is really sort of the se-
cret sauce to American success. It is 
the notion that you can come from 
anywhere, with virtually nothing, and 
you can legally immigrate to the 
United States and you can begin to get 
one of those very difficult jobs working 
in the fields, working in a meatpacking 
plant, or someplace else and begin your 
climb toward the American dream. 
That, to me, is one of the crown jew-
els of our country. It is what makes us 
different. You look at other countries 
around the world; they don’t welcome 
immigrants. They shun immigrants, 
and their economies and their coun-
tries suffer for it. 
Let me just say, I agree with the 
Senator from Illinois about the con-
tribution of immigrants. I listened 
very carefully as a border State Sen-
ator. My State is 40 percent Hispanic. I 
am sure the Senator from Nevada has a 
large Hispanic population. They are 
part of us. They are part of our great 
Nation and make tremendous contribu-
tions. 
The Hispanics in my State are patri-
ots. They volunteer in disproportionate 
numbers to serve in the military. They 
work at jobs that are very difficult. 
They are very tight-knit families. They 
are people of faith. They believe in 
hard work and, most fundamentally, 
they believe in the American dream. 
But I don’t think it does any tribute 
to their contributions or their sac-
rifices to say that people can come to 
this country without complying with 
our laws. 
I also join in the Senator’s frustra-
tion at our inability to get anything 
substantially done in this space, but I 
don’t think it is good enough for us to 
complain about how hard it is. We are 
all volunteers. What we have to do is 
do the hard work, and we have not done 
it since I have been here. We have not 
done the hard work to try to build that 
consensus in order to pass meaningful 
immigration reform, and we need to do 
that. It is on us. We can’t blame some-
body else. We are the ones responsible. 
We haven’t done it, and we need to do 
it. 
But I would just point out, and the 
Senator from Illinois knows this, that 
my State has a 1,200-mile border with 
Mexico. This is ground zero for the hu-
manitarian crisis that is currently ap-
pearing at the border. The Biden ad-
ministration reversed a lot of the poli-
cies of the previous administration 
without having an alternative plan in 
place, and it was interpreted as laying 
out the welcome mat for anybody and 
everybody who wanted to come to the 
United States. That is why we are see-
ing these unprecedented numbers, or at 
least numbers we haven’t seen for 20 
years, in people trying to stream 
across the border into the United 
States. 
I know that there is a lot of debate 
about, well, should we have physical 
barriers at the border? The truth is, 
the experts, the Border Patrol, have 
told all of us that, yes, you have to 
have physical barriers in some hard-to- 
control places, but you also need tech-
nology, and you need boots on the 
ground because this is not just about 
people immigrating to the United 
States; this is about the drugs that 
killed 93,000 Americans last year alone, 
most of which come across the south-
ern border—cocaine, meth, fentanyl, 
heroin, just to name a few. When we 
see the current crisis at the border be-
cause of this reversal of the previous 
administration’s policies without any 
alternative plan in place, this is an 
open invitation to the cartels to take 
advantage of the circumstances. 
What it means, as a practical matter, 
when so many people come across at 
the same time, which is what is hap-
pening now, including tens of thou-
sands of unaccompanied children, the 
Border Patrol, which is the law en-
forcement officials who are given the 
mission of securing our border—they 
have to leave the frontline of the bor-
der to go change diapers and clean and 
feed these kids because there is simply 
not enough personnel there in order to 
handle this flood of humanity. 
What happens when they leave the 
frontlines? Well, in one sector, the Bor-
der Patrol Chief told me 40 percent of 
their 
agents 
had 
to 
leave 
the 
frontlines, which then was a green 
light for the drug components, the drug 
smugglers, to bring the poison that 
killed 93,000 Americans in the United 
States last year alone across the bor-
der. 
These 
criminal 
organizations 
are 
very sophisticated. They know exactly 
what they are doing. They know ex-
actly how to exploit the vulnerabilities 
in our law, which is why they also have 
understood that if you flood tens of 
thousands—in 1 month alone, nearly 
200,000—of people across the border, 
that you are going to overwhelm the 
system, and that if you coach the mi-
grants to make a claim of credible fear 
of persecution, that you might just be 
put into our asylum system, which 
then has about 1.3, I think, million 
cases backlogged in our immigration 
courts, which means we are forced to 
give you a notice to appear at a future 
hearing so you can present your case in 
front of an immigration judge, and 
maybe, just maybe, you can make your 
case. As a practical matter, only about 
10 percent of the people who do appear 
in front of an immigration judge are 
able to meet the legal criteria for asy-
lum. 
But here is how the cartels, how the 
transnational criminal organizations, 
have figured out how to exploit our

laws: Because we have to release people 
and give them a notice to appear be-
cause of the sheer volume, most of 
them don’t show up for their court 
hearing. So they have succeeded be-
cause of the gaps in our law, not be-
cause of a lack of a physical barrier 
along the border. They are turning 
themselves in to the Border Patrol and 
making this claim of asylum because 
they know that they will more than 
likely succeed in making their way 
into the United States. 
I don’t care how many times the Vice 
President goes to Central America or 
talks about root causes of illegal immi-
gration. I don’t care how many times 
Director Mayorkas tells Cubans: Don’t 
come to America because of the danger 
of coming overseas into our country. 
These organizations are smart. They 
are whispering in the ear of these mi-
grants. They are saying: If you will pay 
us enough money, we will get you to 
America. And these migrants watch 
TV. They watch cable TV. They take 
phone calls and get emails from their 
friends and relatives in the United 
States. They know that this statement 
‘‘don’t try to come to America’’ is just 
completely inconsistent with what is 
happening on the ground. 
So I don’t think it does us any good 
to complain about how hard our job is 
or how many times we have failed to 
get the job done. What I am really con-
cerned about right now is that the ma-
jority whip, who is also chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee, has basically 
told us he is going to give up on a bi-
partisan immigration reform bill, and 
they are going to try to jam this 
through on a purely party-line vote in 
this 
reconciliation 
bill, 
otherwise 
known as the reckless tax-and-spend-
ing spree. 
Now, I don’t expect that the Parlia-
mentarian will allow them to do that 
under the rules of the Senate. This 
would completely circumvent the rules 
of the Senate, which require, on mat-
ters of substantive legislation, 60 votes 
to close off debate, the so-called fili-
buster rule. 
But I couldn’t resist responding to 
the majority whip’s—the Senator from 
Illinois—statements about how hard 
our job is. I don’t think it does us much 
good to come here and say: This is real-
ly hard. This is really hard. 
Our constituents expect us to fix it, 
and we know how to do it if we will 
just do our job. 
H.R. 3684 
So, Madam President, on the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill now before the 
Senate, I am glad to see that the ma-
jority leader, Senator SCHUMER, is al-
lowing amendments to be presented 
from folks on both sides. Senator SCHU-
MER had given us an artificial deadline 
to finish the bill, but he has also told 
us we are not going home until we do 
so, and we take him at his word. But I 
hope he will continue to allow this 
process to play out, no matter how 
long it takes, until this legislation is 
ready to be voted on. That is prin-
cipally 
because 
the 
process 
that 
brought this bill to the floor did not in-
volve the regular, normal hearings and 
markups across multiple Senate com-
mittees. That is certainly not a criti-
cism of the bipartisan group who has 
gotten us to where we are; it is really 
just a statement of the dysfunction of 
the legislative process in the Senate 
these days. But the fact is, the vast 
majority of the Senators in this Cham-
ber did not have a hand in crafting this 
legislation even though it will impact 
every single community across the 
country. 
I believe the bipartisan group worked 
in good faith to get us to the starting 
gate. Now it is time to allow every 
Senator, representing every State in 
the country, to weigh in and offer im-
provements to the bill. I have said from 
the beginning that an open amendment 
process will be critical to the success of 
this legislation, and that is especially 
true when it comes to paying for this 
legislation. 
We are waiting for the Congressional 
Budget Office, the official scorer, to 
tell us what the costs will be and 
whether we have been successful in of-
fering offsetting pay-fors. One budget 
expert at the Committee for a Respon-
sible Federal Budget has already fore-
casted a discouraging score. He esti-
mated the bill would only raise about 
$208 billion—less than half of the new 
spending in the bill. 
But it is important for all of us to re-
alize we are also reauthorizing the ex-
piring 
surface 
transportation 
bill, 
which is ordinarily financed by the 
highway trust fund, and it is going to 
require another $118 billion to shore 
that up because the White House has 
taken off the table any other pay-fors 
that would include a user fee on elec-
tric vehicles or indexing the gas tax or 
other ideas that would fill in that gap. 
So another $118 billion of borrowed 
money is going to be necessary to fill 
that gap. I don’t think any of us regard 
that as a good outcome. Maybe it is the 
best 
we 
can 
do 
under 
the 
cir-
cumstances. 
But as it stands now, our debt to 
GDP, our debt to our gross domestic 
product ratio, is at the highest level it 
has been since World War II. In other 
words, we fought a world war to defeat 
imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, and 
we didn’t ask how much it cost; we did 
what we had to do. We did the same 
thing when it came to COVID, which 
was a domestic equivalent, I think, of 
war, defeating the virus and shoring up 
our economy. 
Our country has invested a huge 
amount of money in the war against 
COVID–19, and now is not the time to 
double down on out-of-control spending 
for a nonemergency matter. We need to 
find responsible ways to finance these 
new expenses, and I hope we will have 
an opportunity to vote on a range of 
amendments to that end. 
I have been proud to work with Sen-
ator PADILLA, our new Senator from 
California, a Democrat, to offer an 
amendment that would provide more 
funding for a variety of infrastructure 
projects, including roads, bridges, and 
public transit. What it does is it gives 
State and local leaders more authority 
when it comes to identifying and in-
vesting in the greatest needs of their 
States and their communities. And 
here is the kicker: It does so without 
increasing the deficit one penny. That 
is because it gives State and local lead-
ers the ability to spend COVID relief 
funding that they already have on in-
frastructure projects that might other-
wise be neglected. They are not re-
quired to do so, but our amendment 
would allow them to do so rather than 
to claw that money back when the ap-
propriation sunsets or to put guard-
rails on it and say you can only use it 
for some prescribed uses, which, frank-
ly, they have more money to spend 
than they know what to do with when 
it comes to those authorized uses. 
As folks hunkered down in their 
home to slow the spread of the virus, 
the change in travel patterns hurt 
more than airlines and hotels; it put a 
serious dent in State and local trans-
portation budgets in all of our States. 
State departments of transportation 
are facing an estimated $18 billion in 
shortfalls through 2024. Leaders across 
the country have had to delay or can-
cel critical transportation projects be-
cause of a lack of funding, and it is un-
clear when those projects may get back 
on track. 
I might say that one of the things we 
have seen with the eviction morato-
rium expiring is that $46 billion of 
money we appropriated last year still 
hasn’t gotten to the intended bene-
ficiary, to the people who are trying to 
pay their rent but can’t pay their rent. 
So we have a huge problem, logistical 
problem, in voting on money and actu-
ally getting it to the intended bene-
ficiary. That is true in COVID–19. That 
is true in disaster relief. The type of 
thing that Senator PADILLA and I are 
suggesting is to take money that is al-
ready in the hands of the State and 
local governments and let them use it 
so they can do it quickly on invest-
ments which will last and endure rath-
er than just spend it on operating ex-
penses. 
There is an urgent need for more 
transportation funding, and that is ex-
actly what our amendment would pro-
vide. There is no mandate, as I said, 
that it be spent for a single transpor-
tation project. If a city or a State or a 
county has plans to use their funds on 
pandemic-related expenses, those plans 
will not be interrupted or called into 
question. It simply provides our local 
leaders what they have asked each of 
us for most, and it starts with flexi-
bility. 
If a city is experiencing a spike in 
COVID cases and needs to use Federal 
funding to buy additional ICU bedspace 
or hire new healthcare workers, they 
can and they should move forward with 
those plans. This is not about cutting 
resources that are needed. But we

know that many States and localities 
simply don’t have enough qualifying 
expenses to use the money that they 
have been given. They are looking for 
ways to spend the dollars they already 
have as given to them in the CARES 
Act and the American Rescue Plan. 
That is not to say they don’t want 
this funding; they just want to be able 
to use it consistent with the guardrails 
that Congress has provided, and that is 
what our amendment will allow. 
The broad support for this amend-
ment is a testament to the importance 
of these changes. Our amendment has 
been endorsed by two dozen organiza-
tions that represent a diverse range of 
stakeholders, 
from 
the 
National 
League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors, the Association of Metropoli-
tan 
Planning 
Organizations—all 
of 
which advocate on behalf of cities 
across the country. 
We have also received endorsements 
from the American Road & Transpor-
tation Builders Association, which rep-
resents all facets of the transportation 
construction industry, as well as the 
American Public Transportation Asso-
ciation. It also includes organizations 
that advocate for safer roads, like the 
American Traffic Safety Services Asso-
ciation. 
I have been pleased to find common 
ground with Senator PADILLA and our 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
help build support for this amendment 
and, I think, actually enhance the 
work done by the bipartisan negoti-
ating group. 
This is not something they were able 
to get done in that negotiating group— 
they have told me—even though it was 
a subject of discussion. So now it is a 
chance for the rest of us, on a bipar-
tisan basis, to weigh in and make this 
bill better. 
Throughout the process, we have 
made 
adjustments 
so 
States 
with 
unique, but no less important, infra-
structure needs can put this funding 
toward those uses. We are in the proc-
ess of making some final tweaks to en-
sure that we receive broad bipartisan 
support, as well as that of the White 
House, and I hope we will have a vote 
on this amendment on the Senate floor 
soon. 
Our amendment will empower local 
officials to make the best decisions for 
their communities and ensure that tax-
payers get the most bang for their 
buck with these relief funds that have 
already been appropriated; and then, if 
we do not authorize their use in the 
manner I have described, will likely be 
spent on annual or reoccurring ex-
penses rather than on something that 
will endure for a long time, like infra-
structure. 
So I hope our amendment will come 
to a vote in the Senate very soon. 
There is no reason—there is no rea-
son—to rush the amendment process 
and to cut off good amendments for a 
vote or consideration that will actually 
improve this legislation. There are a 
lot of great ideas out there to strength-
en this bill, to maximize the impact of 
every dollar, and pay for these invest-
ments responsibly. 
So let me just close by saying I ap-
preciate the hard work that has gone 
into this bill so far, and I hope we will 
continue to have more opportunities to 
improve it as the amendment process 
goes forward. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The junior Senator from 
North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
want to take some time to share some 
of my thoughts on this Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act that we are 
debating today, and I wasn’t intending 
to speak specifically to the amendment 
Senator CORNYN just brought up, but I 
just can’t resist saying: Man, I wish 
you well. 
I think when—a bipartisan solution, 
like 
Senator 
CORNYN
and 
Senator 
PADILLA have come up with, to provide 
flexibility to our Governors and our 
communities just makes all the sense 
in the world. 
So I am looking forward to voting 
yes, and I hope we can get a resolution 
that allows at least 59 of my closest 
friends to do the same. 
I want to start out by thanking Sen-
ators PORTMAN
and SINEMA
for pro-
viding such incredible leadership, and 
to the group of bipartisan Senators 
who negotiated and coordinated this 
incredible effort. 
I also want to thank Senator CAPITO, 
who is managing, of course, this floor 
process, along with Environment and 
Public Works Committee Chairman 
TOM CARPER. The progress that they 
have made on this issue with the ad-
ministration earlier this year, paired 
with the excellent leadership that they 
provided the committee, really exem-
plifies what is possible when we work 
together, and it has allowed us to get 
to this point. 
Reviving America’s roads and bridges 
is a longstanding national priority of 
Congress, and is one that has taken us 
too long to address. We need reliable, 
accessible infrastructure to operate lo-
cally and to compete globally; and as it 
currently stands, the bill before us is 
well positioned to meet that exact 
need. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act isn’t perfect—no bill ever is— 
but it makes historic investments in 
assets that will benefit every American 
for many, many years. 
I applaud the group for using the sur-
face transportation bill that we unani-
mously passed out of the Environment 
and Public Works Committee as the 
foundation for this bill. As the lead Re-
publican on the Transportation and In-
frastructure Subcommittee, I know 
how much time and effort both sides of 
the aisle have put in to surface trans-
portation reauthorization. The end re-
sult reflected the good work we accom-
plished, and it was the perfect building 
block for the package that is before us. 
As you know, I was not an original 
part of this bipartisan negotiating 
group. However, when I was approached 
for my input, I made my top priorities 
clear: 
One, keeping the permitting reforms 
in our bill—permitting reforms like the 
one-agency decision that was a rule 
that President Trump put into place, 
that President Biden removed his first 
day in office. It is codified in this bill 
for surface transportation; 
Prioritizing dedicating funding to 
States and to their departments of 
transportation as part of the tradi-
tional formula for distribution; 
Limiting the expansion of urban 
transit programs; and 
Including the bipartisan bill that 
Senator LUJA´ N
and I introduced to 
clean up orphaned and abandoned oil 
and gas wells. 
I was glad to see these provisions, as 
well as our committee’s Drinking and 
Wastewater Infrastructure Act, in the 
bill. 
I also appreciate the use of unspent 
COVID–19 relief funds to help pay for 
these priorities rather than being used 
for paying people to not work and add-
ing fuel to the fire of inflation. This 
does just the opposite. 
I thank my colleagues for asking for 
my opinion, and I am even more grate-
ful that they listened and included 
these provisions in our final product. 
Infrastructure has been a priority for 
Congress because it is a priority for our 
constituents. America cannot succeed 
without a robust infrastructure from 
one coast to the other and all the 
places, like North Dakota, in between. 
We need roads and bridges to go from 
farm to town and from town to city, 
from city to city, and State to State. 
We use ports and waterways and rail-
roads to move the products that we 
produce to places they could otherwise 
never get to. We use rail and air to con-
nect with family and friends and other 
business associates around the world. 
And we use broadband connectivity to 
facilitate transactions, both personal 
and business. 
Infrastructure is foundational to our 
way of life, and it is the constitutional 
responsibility of the Federal Govern-
ment to facilitate interstate com-
merce, including the movement of 
goods and services along our highways 
and byways and waterways and rail-
ways. 
Rural States, like North Dakota, 
know this better than most. In fact, 
Rugby, 
ND, 
is 
literally 
the 
geo-
graphical center of the North American 
continent. We are landlocked, and we 
rely on our transportation infrastruc-
ture to get where we need to go and, 
more importantly, to move the prod-
ucts that we produce to where they 
need to get. 
For example, North Dakota is the top 
producer of durum wheat, which gets 
ground into semolina flour, which be-
comes the main ingredient in pasta. 
The wheat goes from the field to a 
grain elevator by a farm road, to a mill 
by rail, and to a processing plant by 
both, and then it goes anywhere from a

grocery store in California to a res-
taurant in New York, or perhaps over-
seas to a market far away. 
And just like every other commodity 
we produce, it requires a reliable infra-
structure system that is safe and suffi-
cient for every single mile on the jour-
ney. 
The United States needs rural Amer-
ica, and rural America needs infra-
structure. The personal needs it fulfills 
and the economic benefits it delivers 
are obvious. Rather than investing tril-
lions of taxpayer dollars on govern-
ment handouts to people to not work, 
we can spend money on putting people 
to work, revitalizing a system that di-
rectly benefits all of us, and that is 
what the plan before us would help ac-
complish. 
It is not perfect—no bill is, as I said— 
and there are parts of it that I don’t 
support, but there are parts, I know, 
that some of my colleagues do not sup-
port, even though they are top prior-
ities for me. 
Our Founding Fathers intended for 
Congress to collaborate and find com-
mon ground. Those are functions of our 
system; they are not a side effect. It is 
easy to imagine if every Founder had 
demanded to get everything they want-
ed and nothing else, well, then we 
would have had a king, and we may not 
have had the system of cooperative 
Federalism that we do today. And if 
enough of them believed that doing 
nothing is better than getting 80 or 90 
percent of what they wanted or—then 
our more perfect Union would never 
have gotten started and had a chance 
to become that. 
The inability to meet in the middle is 
not an excuse for inaction, especially 
when it comes to addressing not just 
the pressing needs of the American 
people here at home, but also pro-
tecting our standing as a country on 
the world stage. 
We understand how important infra-
structure is, but so does China, so does 
Russia, so do all of our adversaries who 
would like to see us continue to fall be-
hind. The Chinese Communist Party 
would love to see America’s roads and 
bridges crumble. They would be happy 
to let infrastructure get in the way of 
American production and allow for 
them to meet the needs of the global 
economy in our absence. 
The bill that we have before us gives 
us an opportunity to help stop that 
from happening. 
Now, while I am all for working 
across the aisle, that doesn’t mean I 
will support bills that I fundamentally 
disagree with, like the $3.5 trillion-plus 
spending bill that Senate Democrats 
plan to cobble together after we finish 
this bipartisan infrastructure bill. 
I oppose the Democrats’ reckless tax- 
and-spend agenda, and I will join each 
of my Republican colleagues in oppos-
ing it and offering amendments to 
change its harmful outcomes. 
That bill is completely separate from 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill that 
we are talking about today. They are 
not tied together, despite what rhet-
oric there may be otherwise. Both 
should be considered on their own mer-
its separately. 
What a shame it would be for Demo-
crats to offer the American public a 
glimpse of bipartisanship and coopera-
tion to only do an about-face and hold 
it hostage while they jam through a 
massive tax increase and growth of the 
Federal Government, adding to infla-
tion. 
I hope my colleagues will choose to 
build on this bipartisan success and re-
sist the urge to follow the partisan 
whims of their political base. 
As it stands, the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act would be a sig-
nificant win for our country. I know it 
would be for my State. So far we have 
avoided adding poison pills or derailing 
the process, and I urge my colleagues 
to keep it that way. 
North Dakota needs safe and suffi-
cient infrastructure. America needs 
safe and sufficient infrastructure. And 
the world needs the United States to 
have safe and sufficient infrastructure. 
I urge my colleagues to keep the neg-
ative parts of the bill in perspective 
and to appreciate the opportunity we 
have today to make a difference for our 
constituents. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, the 
remarks of my colleague from North 
Dakota have inspired me to stand and 
join him; and also the fact that we are 
in a room of great significance and si-
lence reigns, and I hate just to fill it 
with words, but I think the topic we 
are talking about is extremely impor-
tant. 
I appreciate the good Senator’s sup-
port and effort in helping craft this leg-
islation—this bipartisan legislation to 
improve our infrastructure in our 
country. 
I also salute the leadership on both 
sides of the aisle for allowing a robust 
amendment process. 
There is no question but that there 
are many opportunities to improve the 
legislation as written. The chance for 
our colleagues to offer adjustments and 
improvements is a part of our tradition 
and a good part of our tradition. 
I would concur that we do need to up-
grade our infrastructure. I think most 
Americans who have experienced our 
infrastructure would come to the same 
conclusion. Too often, our roads are in 
need of repair. Many times, we have 
communities that are not connected 
with high-speed travel opportunities 
from one part of the city to another. 
Our transit, in some cases, is old, slow, 
and does not reach communities that 
need it. 
Our rail system, particularly in the 
northeast, which is an important cor-
ridor for travel, is way out of date. 
Some people know you can drive be-
tween some cities. Where there are 
trains, you can drive faster than you 
can take the train. 
We have structurally deficient and 
dangerous bridges, in some cases, that 
need to be repaired. So I think there is 
general agreement on both sides of the 
aisle that we need to improve our in-
frastructure. 
It is known by people in this country, 
and I think particularly brought home 
to us, if you travel in other countries 
and see what they are doing and then 
you compare where we are—you would 
think: Boy, we used to lead the world 
in these things, and now we are not. 
And it is having an impact on our pro-
ductivity as a nation because of addi-
tional travel time necessary for us to 
get to and from work as well as other 
endeavors. 
If that is going to happen, we have 
only two options right now and prob-
ably for the indefinite future. Right 
now, we have a circumstance where my 
party is in the minority—not by much. 
We are basically tied here in the Sen-
ate, although the tie is broken by the 
Vice President. So the Democrats have 
the majority in the Senate, in the 
House, and, of course, with the White 
House. Given that circumstance, it is 
possible for the Democrats to write an 
infrastructure bill all by themselves 
and simply pass it through a process 
known as reconciliation. That is one 
option. 
The other option is to work together 
on a bipartisan basis, where we craft a 
better bill with the input of Repub-
licans and Democrats. That is the op-
tion that is before us now. 
There is not a third alternative, 
which is Republicans only draft the 
bill. I would love that alternative, but 
it is just not available to us because we 
don’t hold the House, the Senate, and 
the White House. So we have two op-
tions. Do we want our Democrat col-
leagues to draft a bill all by themselves 
or do we want to work together with 
Republicans and Democrats and fash-
ion something that is bipartisan. 
Now, I note that when you work in a 
bipartisan basis, there are some things 
the Democrats will want to include 
that we Republicans would rather not 
have there, and it is obvious that that 
is the case. I am sure that is the case 
for Democrats as well. They will see 
things that we have included that they 
just as soon would not have there. And 
it is very easy for either side—or both 
sides, rather—to point out the things 
in the bipartisan bill that they don’t 
like and to attack it as not being fully 
in conformity with their views. But 
that is the nature of two parties work-
ing together. 
Now, some would say: We could do 
better. Let’s have another alternative, 
a different bipartisan approach. 
My answer is: Go at it. Have at it. 
No one is keeping people from work-
ing together if they want to come up 
with a better piece of legislation. Boy, 
I would be anxious to see what it is. 
But in order to get a bill passed, it 
must be acceptable to Democrats and 
Republicans. And that is unless, in my 
party, we are able to have Republicans

in the majority in the House and the 
Senate, and the White House, which we 
don’t have at this stage. 
So, again, the alternative is, if you 
can come up with a better bipartisan 
bill, do it. Two, amend it as you feel 
appropriate—and I think there are 
good amendments that are coming for-
ward that I have supported and will 
support going forward. But we must 
not let the desire for perfection on the 
part of people like myself overcome the 
desire to have a good bill ultimately 
reached. 
I 
think 
it 
is 
actually 
counter-
productive for either side to take at-
tack shots at the items in the bill they 
don’t 
like. 
Instead, 
bring 
forward 
amendments. See if you can improve 
the bill. If you can’t do that, come up 
with a bill that has bipartisan support, 
because that is the only alternative we 
face, other than a bill drafted exclu-
sively by Democrats. 
I, for one, think this bill is a good 
bill, on balance. It will be good for my 
State. I think it will be good for every 
State. We will get an upgrade—a badly 
needed upgrade—in the infrastructure 
of this country. 
Again, is it ideal, perfect? Far from 
it, but it is a big step forward and one 
heck of a huge step of advantage rel-
ative to having one party alone write a 
piece of legislation. I think it is fair to 
say if Democrats alone write an infra-
structure bill, my State of Utah won’t 
be real happy by the time it is done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor today to speak in 
support of the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, which is the bipar-
tisan legislation that is before the 
Chamber that will make historic in-
vestments in our Nation’s core infra-
structure, and I am pleased to follow 
my colleague and friend from Utah, 
Senator ROMNEY, who was one of those 
whom I worked with to help negotiate 
this package. 
This is historic legislation that pro-
vides $550 billion in new Federal invest-
ments over the next 5 years to respond 
to the needs that are facing our coun-
try. This bill will rebuild crumbling 
roads and bridges and tunnels across 
the country. It will provide clean 
drinking water in homes and address 
harmful contaminants. It will increase 
connectivity in our communities to 
bring broadband to even the most rural 
parts of our country. It will prioritize 
sustainable solutions to improve our 
infrastructure systems for future gen-
erations. And it will combat climate 
change by making the monumental in-
vestments in our clean energy grid and 
electric vehicle infrastructure that we 
must make. 
Now, this bill was a long time in the 
making, as I am sure my colleague 
from Utah would agree. Over the past 3 
months, there have been many late 
nights, early mornings, and countless 
conversations about how to make the 
best use of this opportunity to invest 
in our Nation’s infrastructure. 
I very much appreciate the continued 
good faith and negotiations from law-
makers on both sides of the aisle and 
the White House and the leadership of 
Senators KYRSTEN
SINEMA
and ROB 
PORTMAN to deliver this bipartisan in-
frastructure agreement. I also appre-
ciate the work of the chairs and rank-
ing members of relevant Senate com-
mittees who laid the foundation for so 
much of the bipartisan work that has 
gone into this bill, as well as the lead-
ership of both parties for giving us the 
space and time to get this agreement 
to the floor. 
Now, I could spend all day talking 
about the many aspects of this legisla-
tion that meaningfully invest in our 
communities and in our country, but 
today I want to specifically talk about 
two key areas that I worked on. Both 
of these issues, water and broadband, 
speak to the critical needs in New 
Hampshire and across the country. 
Water and wastewater infrastructure 
is one of the major investments we 
make in this bill, with $55 billion in-
vested in this area. Now, no parent 
should have to worry about the safety 
of their family’s water when they turn 
on the tap, but, unfortunately, as most 
of us know, this is not the case for too 
many 
Americans, 
because 
com-
promised water supplies, due in part to 
our rundown water infrastructure, is 
an issue across this country and in 
some places in New Hampshire. 
This was a problem for decades before 
the pandemic hit, but looking at a cri-
sis like COVID–19 has illustrated just 
how basic and essential clean and safe 
drinking water is for our communities. 
Righting this wrong starts with invest-
ing in our water systems, which have 
been severely underfunded for too long. 
According to the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, drinking water utili-
ties will need to invest $472.6 billion 
over the next 20 years in order to pro-
vide safe and sufficient drinking water 
to the American public. Well, fortu-
nately, we have a big chunk of that as 
a down payment in this proposal. And 
earlier this year, the Senate passed 
overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan vote, 
the Drinking Water and Wastewater In-
frastructure Act. That bill makes a 
historic investment in our water infra-
structure through authorizations. And 
in addition to putting significant fund-
ing toward that effort, the bipartisan 
infrastructure package before us in-
cludes $15 billion to replace lead serv-
ice lines, which is a huge public health 
priority, and it is an issue that has 
long plagued communities across this 
country. 
Another real public health concern 
that is addressed in this bill is the 
presence of per- and polyfluoralkyl 
substances, or PFAS, in our water sup-
plies. Preventing exposure, cleaning up 
contaminated sites, and understanding 
the full scope of the health implica-
tions associated with these chemicals 
is critical for so many affected by 
PFAS in their water. 
As I have heard again and again from 
New Hampshire families, discovering 
that you have been drinking contami-
nated water can produce a range of 
emotions from anger and fear to guilt. 
That is what I heard from so many par-
ents who had children at the former 
Pease Air Force Base, where they were 
in childcare, and parents thought they 
were safe in those childcare centers. 
But they found out that they had been 
drinking 
water 
contaminated 
with 
PFAS. That contamination at the 
former Pease Air Force Base forced the 
city of Portsmouth to shut off three 
drinking water wells in 2014. The con-
tamination was created by the use of 
firefighting foam by the Air Force 
when Pease was an Air Force base. 
One of those wells that was shut 
down, the Haven well, has just come 
back online this week, after 7 years. It 
was inoperable for 7 years. 
PFAS 
contamination 
surrounding 
the Saint-Gobain manufacturing plant 
in Merrimack, NH, and in areas around 
the Coakley Landfill Superfund site in 
the Seacoast create an ongoing worry 
for Granite State families also because 
of PFAS contamination. So you can 
imagine what those parents felt like 
when they found out that their chil-
dren had an elevated level of PFAS in 
their bloodstream, and they didn’t 
really understand what that meant. 
I remember talking to one mother 
who told me she had taken her daugh-
ter to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical 
Center for her health exam, and she 
talked to the doctor about the elevated 
levels of PFAS in her blood. She said: 
The doctor didn’t know what I was 
talking about, because this is an 
emerging contaminant. 
But thanks to the work of so many of 
those 
affected—people 
like 
Andrea 
Amico in Portsmouth, who helped 
found a group called Testing for Pease, 
and folks involved with the Merrimack 
Citizens for Clean Water—they have 
raised awareness and worked to find so-
lutions to clean up our drinking water. 
We owe it to them, to all of those fami-
lies affected by PFAS and contami-
nated water supplies, a serious com-
mitment to stop this problem where it 
starts and to give them the peace of 
mind that they so deserve. The com-
prehensive measures to address our 
water infrastructure that are con-
tained in this historic bill will help do 
just that. 
Now, water infrastructure is a seri-
ous issue that New Hampshire shares 
with many other States throughout the 
country. Like water, another shared 
issue is access to broadband or high- 
speed internet service. 
The challenges of the COVID–19 pan-
demic—just as I highlighted the chal-
lenge of not having enough access to 
clean water—highlighted just how im-
portant it is for our communities to 
have fast and reliable access to the 
internet. Whether we like it or not, we 
live in a digital world. We all relied on 
that digital world more than ever dur-
ing the COVID crisis so that our kids 
could go to school, so our grandparents 
and families could keep their medical

appointments, and so our businesses 
could stay afloat. Of course, even be-
fore the pandemic started, the digital 
divide created an equity issue that 
deepened 
disparities 
in 
education, 
health, and business. 
If you live in a community in north-
ern New Hampshire, how can you at-
tract business to your community if 
you don’t have access to high-speed 
internet, if the business can’t open a 
website and tell people what they do? 
Just last month, I met with rep-
resentatives from several towns in 
southwestern New Hampshire, another 
part of our State where they have been 
struggling to bring high-speed internet 
service to their residents. Due to their 
rural nature, these towns and others 
like them are unable to attract a pro-
vider to work with them. About a quar-
ter of those that live in these towns are 
considered unserved and far more are 
underserved. 
At that session, I talked to a woman 
named Molly Miller. She is a tele-
communications committee member 
from Hancock, NH, a town with about 
1,600 residents. She talked about the 
challenges that her family had experi-
enced trying to work and do school 
from home during the pandemic. She 
said everyone had to disconnect while 
her youngest son was participating in 
college classes, and she shared a story 
about her son. She said: He was unable 
to turn in his final exam from one of 
his courses because the file was too 
large. He couldn’t print it because they 
didn’t have enough speed—download 
speed in their house. By the time he 
made it to the library to print out the 
file, it was too late. His exam was not 
accepted. 
That is just the kind of everyday 
challenges that families, who don’t 
have access to high-speed internet, 
face. And broadband access isn’t a par-
tisan priority. Lawmakers on both 
sides of the aisle recognize the need for 
significant investments to ensure that 
all of our workers, our students, and 
our families are able to connect to the 
critical resources that are provided by 
the internet. 
This infrastructure bill commits $65 
billion to bring high-speed internet to 
communities in New Hampshire and all 
across the country. These bold invest-
ments are what we need to create jobs, 
to enhance the safety of our infrastruc-
ture networks, and to improve this Na-
tion’s competitiveness. 
Now, had I written the bill before us 
on my own, I am sure, like everyone in 
this Chamber, it would have included 
different priorities than what is before 
us in some cases. But, as we know, that 
is not how the give and take of nego-
tiations work. It is not how com-
promise works. You give and you get. 
And the fact is that New Hampshire 
and the United States are going to get 
a whole lot in this infrastructure pack-
age. 
We also know that legislation that 
has broad bipartisan support stands a 
better chance at lasting longer without 
threats of being repealed or reversed. 
President Biden supports this package, 
and we have received strong support 
across the aisle through the procedural 
votes that we have had so far. 
I am proud to have worked with my 
colleagues to help craft this bipartisan 
bill, and over the coming days, I know 
that I will work with even more people 
in this Chamber as we try and move 
this legislation through the Senate. 
Thank you. I look forward to a strong, 
positive vote by the end of this week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
CATTLE RANCHERS 
Mr. HAWLEY. I rise today, Mr. Presi-
dent, to talk about the challenges fac-
ing the cattle ranchers in my State and 
across the country, challenges not just 
to their day-to-day operations but to 
their very livelihoods, and I rise today 
to talk about what we can do about it. 
I have a simple message: We can take 
action today that will work and we can 
take action that will make a difference 
and we should take it now. 
The situation that faces our cattle 
ranchers in Missouri and around the 
country, and, for that matter, many 
other livestock producers, is very, very 
serious, and the situation is, frankly, 
untenable. Let me tell you what I am 
talking about. 
Just in the last year, the cost to con-
sumers for beef has increased by double 
digits. That is year-on-year, from 2019 
to 2020, a double-digit increase. What 
has happened, though, to cattle ranch-
ers, to those who actually raise the 
beef, who raise the cattle, and then sell 
it to market? The price for them, has it 
gone up? No, it has gone down. In fact, 
over the last decade, cattle ranchers 
have seen their share of profits decline 
by double digits. 
So what is happening here? Cattle 
ranchers are getting less, much less, in 
some instances—and, by the way, so 
are other producers of livestock—and 
yet the cost to consumers is going up. 
Somebody is getting wealthy in this 
transaction, and that ‘‘somebody’’ is 
the packers, the processing companies. 
In America today, our meat proc-
essing supply chain, equipment—the 
entire apparatus—is owned by just a 
small handful of companies. 
Here is what I am talking about: 
Four companies—four—together con-
trol over 80 percent of this country’s 
beef processing operations, 80 percent. 
Even more remarkably, three of the 
giant meatpacking companies control 
63 percent of pork producing, 46 of beef 
packing, 38 of poultry producing. That 
is just three of them. And two—two— 
are based in Brazil and China. So you 
have got four major packers that con-
trol 80 percent of the market, two of 
them based overseas. 
This market concentration is squeez-
ing out the farmers and the ranchers. 
It is enriching the packers, and it is ul-
timately hurting consumers. So I say, 
again, in this system, the only people 
who seem to win are the monopolists. 
We have got to do something about it. 
It is made even worse—the situa-
tion—by the fact that these same mo-
nopoly packers have been found guilty 
or otherwise pled to criminal viola-
tions, criminal uses of their monopoly 
status. 
For example, Pilgrim’s Pride, a sub-
sidiary of a Brazilian-owned company 
called JBS, received $107 million in 
criminal fines for price-fixing in chick-
en markets. JBS separately paid out at 
least three multimillion-dollar settle-
ments over the past year, while Smith-
field, which is owned by China, has 
paid $83 million to settle pork price- 
fixing allegations. 
So here we have these monopoly 
companies, two of them foreign owned, 
that are controlling the meat proc-
essing industry, controlling the entire 
supply 
chain, 
squeezing 
American 
farmers and ranchers, raising prices on 
consumers, and committing criminal 
violations while they do it. 
Now, many have called, including 
me, for antitrust investigations. Some 
have called, including me, for antitrust 
prosecution. And I stand behind those 
positions. 
But I am here today to say that we 
must do more. And, specifically, it is 
time for this administration, the Biden 
administration, to do more because 
they have the tools to do so at their 
disposal. 
Under Federal law, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, has the au-
thority to refuse to provide or to with-
draw inspection services from any of 
these monopoly packers or anyone who 
is reasonably connected to them who 
has been convicted of a felony or any 
other act or circumstance that indi-
cates a lack of integrity as it concerns 
public health. 
That is a broad grant of authority. 
What it means is that USDA could, 
right now, begin to suspend the inspec-
tion services for these monopoly com-
panies, to say to these companies: We 
are not going to allow inspections to go 
forward; we are not going to allow your 
production to go forward until you 
come to the table and agree to resolve 
and desist any criminal misconduct 
and to get a better deal to ranchers and 
farmers across this country. 
This authority is already existing 
under Federal law. I want to be clear. 
It is already on the books. It is already 
provided for by Federal statute. And 
our ranchers and our farmers need it to 
be used, and they need it to be used 
now. 
So, today, I am calling on the Sec-
retary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, to 
invoke these authorities, say to the 
major monopoly companies that USDA

they come to the table, until they open

and our farmers in Missouri and across 
this country get relief. 
I am making that request to the Sec-
retary of Agriculture today. I hope 
that he will act today because our 
farmers and our ranchers deserve relief 
today, and they deserve our help and

the Treasury to be used only for deficit re-
duction. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2464 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 4 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote in relation to the Peters- 
Rounds amendment, No. 2464. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to 
urge adoption of the Peters-Rounds 
amendment, No. 2464. 
I first want to thank Chairman 
MANCHIN and Ranking Member BAR-
RASSO of the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee for working with 
me on this amendment. I would also 
like 
to 
thank 
Senators 
ROUNDS, 
PORTMAN, and WARNER for joining me 
in offering this amendment. 
It is very straightforward. It simply 
would align several cyber security pro-
visions for the Department of Energy 
in this infrastructure legislation with 
existing law. It would require the De-
partment of Energy, the sector risk 
management Agency for the energy 
sector, to coordinate with the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security on cyber 
security efforts. 
DHS is the lead Federal Agency for 
cyber security, and they have a central 
role to play in working across the gov-
ernment to strengthen our cyber de-
fenses. As we have seen from the dam-
aging SolarWinds and Microsoft Ex-
change attacks, a whole-of-government 
approach is necessary to protect crit-
ical infrastructure. 
This amendment will ensure that 
there is a comprehensive approach that 
effectively coordinates our cyber secu-
rity protections for critical infrastruc-
ture across all sectors. It reduces dupli-
cation of efforts and helps protect our 
Nation from the persistent threat 
posed by cyber attacks. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues 
to support this straightforward, bipar-
tisan amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise to 
support the Senator’s motion and the 
amendment. This is a case where we 
are trying to eliminate the silos within 
the 
Federal 
Government. 
When 
it 
comes to cyber security, this is a really 
good example of one where you have 
multiple Agencies trying to work to-
gether. 
This makes it very clear that it is 
not just a matter of discussing or con-
sulting but, rather, that it will be a co-
ordinated effort. It recognizes once 
again that the Department of Home-
land Security and the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency are 
taking the lead role. 
With that, I would offer my full sup-
port as well. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I yield 
back all remaining time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2464 
The question is on agreeing to 
amendment No. 2464. 
Mr. PETERS. I would ask for the 
yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). On this vote, the yeas are 96, 
the nays are 2. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, the amendment is agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 2464) was agreed 
to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 4 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior 
to 
the 
vote 
in 
relation 
to 
Lankford amendment No. 2233. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask the clock not start running right 
away. Senator CAPITO and I want to 
just raise an issue with the Chair and 
our colleagues. 
That last vote took about 50 min-
utes—50 minutes—and they are getting 
longer, not shorter. 
And Senator CAPITO and I want to 
use this as an opportunity just to start 
a conversation amongst our colleagues, 
see if we can’t do better than that, 
maybe a lot better than that. 
So start thinking about it, and we 
would be interested to hear from you. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man. 
I would just like to add my voice 
with the chairman of the EPW Com-
mittee. 
I 
think, 
in 
consideration 
of 
everybody’s time, we have got four 
more amendments and maybe more. 
We could roll through these if we would 
just be concise with the time and come 
in and vote on time. 
So if we don’t, we might look for 
more punitive measures; right, Mr. 
Chairman? 
Mr. CARPER. You never know. We 
might do some voice votes. That would 
be good. 
All right. We thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2233 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
have an amendment that we are calling 
up. It is a very straightforward amend-
ment. 
This deals simply with how we han-
dle E-Verify. The E-Verify system is 
very simple and straightforward. It has 
been used all over the country. It is a 
nonpartisan issue that we have used for 
decades now. 
It verifies whether the people that we 
are actually hiring, and all this pur-
chasing that we are doing, this massive 
billions of dollars will actually be—the 
simple, straightforward piece of it is, 
we are putting billions of dollars into 
our economy right now. We are doing a 
lot of infrastructure with this bill. 
The promise should be that we are 
not just buying American, but we are 
actually hiring Americans as well. This 
is a bipartisan issue, quite frankly. 
President Biden, just today, released 
a statement that this is a once-in-a- 
generation investment in our infra-
structure and will create good-paying 
union jobs, repairing our roads and 
bridges, replacing lead pipes, building 
energy transmission lines. 
It invests in clean energy, manufac-
turing, and zero-emission vehicles, en-
suring that the jobs in the clean energy 
industry 
are 
good-paying, 
quality 
American jobs. That is a great promise 
to be able to make, and it is a great 
statement to make. 
What this amendment does is to 
make sure it actually is American jobs. 
We know there is a tremendous pull 
factor with the American good-paying 
jobs that are out there. This E-Verify 
requirement puts in place, both for the 
contractors and subcontractors, they 
will actually be American citizens. 
So, with that, I ask support for this 
bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if 
you like Federal mandates, here is one. 
Senator LANKFORD wants a Federal 
mandate to require that anyone who 
receives a grant from this bill has to 
sign up for E-Verify. 
Well, what does that mean?

S5813 
August 4, 2021 
It means a school district in my 
home State that ended up getting a 
grant under this bill for energy-effi-
cient improvements, renewable energy 
improvements at public school facili-
ties would now be required by the 
Lankford 
amendment, 
the 
Federal 
mandate, to have E-Verify to check out 
the cafeteria workers in the school dis-
trict. Is that what we really want to 
do? 
Well, how good is E-Verify? Some 
States have done it voluntarily. Eight 
of them have done it for all or most 
employers. You think if you run all 
these employees through the E-Verify 
process, how good is it? 
Well, I can tell you how good it is. Do 
you know how many illegal aliens you 
find when you go through E-Verify? 
One percent. One percent. 
So he is creating a Federal mandate 
and regulations on districts that are 
just trying to get energy improvements 
and reduce their costs and putting in 
an E-Verify requirement to get those 
illegal aliens. 
Well, it turns out that isn’t the situa-
tion at all. It is a mandate that is un-
necessary. I beg my colleagues to give 
these school districts and others no 
more redtape but less redtape. 
Please oppose the Lankford amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
are there any of my 2 minutes left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen 
seconds remaining. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
this is not just a mandate; this is just 
a statement, if we are going to put 
American tax dollars in place, that we 
are actually hiring Americans to do it. 
If we are going to build America, 
let’s also hire Americans in the proc-
ess. That shouldn’t be inconsistent 
with our basic values. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2233

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas are 53, the nays are 45. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, the amendment is not agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 2233) was re-
jected. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2478 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 4 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote in relation to the Cardin 
amendment No. 2478. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise to speak in support of amendment 
No. 2478, which would make permanent 
and expand the Minority Business De-
velopment 
Agency, 
or 
the 
MBDA, 
which is the only Federal Agency to 
focus exclusively on the needs of mi-
nority businesses. 
This amendment is based on the Mi-
nority Business Resiliency Act, which I 
introduced in April, and the language 
is identical to what was passed out of 
the 
Commerce 
Committee 
earlier 
today by a voice vote. 
I want to thank Senator WICKER and 
Senator CANTWELL of the committee 
for their help in getting this to the 
floor. I also want to thank Senator TIM 
SCOTT, Senator CORNYN, and Senator 
BALDWIN, who were also cosponsors of 
this amendment, for helping us reach 
this moment. 
This amendment will give the Agen-
cy the resources and leadership nec-
essary 
to 
help 
underserved 
entre-
preneurs overcome historical barriers 
to small business ownership, innovate 
and start and grow successful busi-
nesses, and create jobs. 
This Agency will also partner with 
Historically Black Colleges and Uni-
versities and other minority-serving 
institutions to reach rural minority 
business enterprises and create a re-
gional network supporting entrepre-
neurial education and help to coordi-
nate Federal resources in service of mi-
nority business enterprises. 
Last year, the MBDA programs and 
services helped minority businesses se-
cure nearly $8 billion in contracts and 
capital, and created nearly 12,000 jobs. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a letter from 17 stakeholders in support 
of this amendment, which includes the 
Small Business Majority, U.S. Black 
Chamber, and U.S. Hispanic Chamber 
of Commerce. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
AUGUST 4, 2021. 
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND MI-
NORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: We write you in 
strong support of Amendment #2478, which 
would codify the Minority Business Develop-
ment Agency (MBDA) at the Department of 
Commerce. As the leaders in the small busi-
ness and minority business communities, we 
hope our unified support represented by the 
signatures below will urge your fellow Sen-
ators to include this language in the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. We urge 
you to support this Amendment. 
The link between infrastructure, revital-
ized manufacturing, and technical assistance 
to the minority entrepreneur community 
cannot be overstated, and we strongly en-
courage building a strong national support 
system through MBDA to ensure minority 
participation in infrastructure investment. 
This amendment, which is based on the bi-
partisan Minority Business Development Act 
of 2021, will support the expansion of Minor-
ity-owned Business Enterprises (MBEs) and 
bolster the country’s economy. Moreover, it 
will ensure that the infrastructure invest-
ments made in the legislation can utilize and 
support 
America’s 
minority-owned 
busi-
nesses. 
Prior to the Coronavirus pandemic, MBEs 
consisted of 30 percent of the country’s 28.6 
million small businesses, contributed nearly 
$1.5 trillion in annual gross receipts and em-
ployed over 7.2 million Americans. Despite 
these significant figures, MBEs stand dis-
proportionately disadvantaged as evidenced 
by challenges with access to capital and col-
lateral, lower credit scores, and less access 
to technical assistance services. 
Created under President Nixon by execu-
tive order, the MBDA has been a significant 
resource in reducing market and capital ac-
cess challenges while growing the number of 
MBEs. In 2020 alone, the MBDA assisted 
MBES in attaining over $7.8 billion in con-
tracts and capital, with 10% of contracts 
made in the manufacturing sector and an-
other 15% made in the utility and construc-
tion sector. Overall, the MBDA assisted 
MBEs at the height of the pandemic to re-
tain or create over 27,000 jobs. 
Despite MBDA’s progress, the pandemic’s 
economic downturn has amplified the need 
to invest in services for underserved and mi-
nority small business owners—particularly 
those within Women, People of Color, and 
Tribal markets. MBEs overwhelmingly are 
concentrated in industries that remain sus-
ceptible to economic disruption, such as per-
sonal and laundry services, and retail. As the 
nation 
experiences 
a 
resurgence 
of 
Coronavirus cases, these fragile markets face 
near-fatal consequences. 
We urge lawmakers to support this amend-
ment as it will strengthen and establish the 
MBDA into federal statute. This critical bi-
partisan proposal, introduced by Senators

Ben Cardin (D–MD), Tim Scott, (R–SC), 
Roger Wicker (R–MS), and Maria Cantwell 
(D–WA) would increase MBDA’s fiscal year 
2021 budget to further safeguard MBEs from 
the devastating inequities brought on by the 
health crisis and promote a diverse entrepre-
neurial pipeline by establishing a process for 
the Minority Business Development Center 
Program to expand its regional coverage to 
reach MBEs in rural areas. 
During this time of economic emergency, 
we believe now is the time for Congress to 
pass equitable and targeted legislation that 
will benefit underserved and rural markets 
and encourage underserved and rural mar-
kets enterprise formation. This amendment 
achieves that while strengthening the infra-
structure package more broadly. 
We commend your work on ensuring that 
all small businesses receive the resources 
necessary to withstand the current economic 
downturn, as well as grow now and into the 
future. We urge you to reach out directly to 
John Stanford (js@prismgroup.global) with 
any questions or comments. 
Thank you for your consideration.

Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I un-
derstand that we may be able to do this 
by a voice vote, so I would ask unani-
mous consent that after my colleagues 
have had a chance to speak, we can vi-
tiate the 60-vote requirement. 
With that, I yield to my colleague 
from Mississippi. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I do 
appreciate the Senator from Maryland 
joining on this. Everything he said 
about the committee action today in 
the Commerce Committee is exactly 
correct. I subscribe to every statement 
that he made. I couldn’t improve on it. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I am indeed 
hopeful we can vitiate the rollcall vote 
and save some time by voicing this 
one. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. We have cleared this 
with both the Democrats and the Re-
publicans for managing the bill, and I 
would ask unanimous consent to viti-
ate the 60-vote requirement on the 
Cardin-Wicker amendment No. 2478. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2478 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment No. 2478. 
The amendment (No. 2478) is agreed 
to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2449 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 4 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to a vote in relation to Daines amend-
ment No. 2449. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
there is funding in this bill for a com-
plex program that would lead to very 
few actual forest projects, and I fear it 
will only function as a shell for pro-
grams like the Climate Conservation 
Corps. 
And to be good stewards of our for-
ests, we need to be good stewards of 
our limited resources. This amendment 
does that by redirecting these funds to 
higher priority accounts, like Good 
Neighbor Authority and post-fire treat-
ment. 
Good Neighbor Authority has rou-
tinely enjoyed very bipartisan support 
in this body and has proven to be one 
of the most effective forestry tools. 
Given recent past and present wildfire 
seasons, redirecting funds to post-fire 
treatment just makes sense. 
It is early August, and Montana is on 
fire. There are nearly 300,000 acres 
burning across our State. We need to 
manage our forests before they manage 
us. And in order to do so, we need to in-
vest in higher priority accounts, and 
my amendment would do just that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment, 
and I will explain my reasons. 
Senator DAINES’ amendment seeks to 
alter the funding levels of provisions in 
the Energy Infrastructure Act as re-
ported out of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. Specifically, the 
amendment cuts funding for hiring vet-
erans and Native youth to do fire pre-
vention projects and directs that fund-
ing to postfire rehabilitation projects 
and to States that carry out projects 
on Federal land. 
We are supportive of both postfire 
projects and States doing work on Fed-
eral land. That is why we funded these 
programs at unprecedented levels in 
our bill. However, we also support 
funding for veterans and Native youth. 
So I do not believe it is appropriate to 
cut the funding for this program. 
So I urge my colleagues to please 
vote no on this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, we 
have had two votes in this tranche; 
first vote about 50 minutes from start 
to close and the second vote about 25 
minutes. 
We are going to propound a unani-
mous consent request—and I am tempt-
ed to do it right now—to try to figure 
out what would be reasonable. My 
sense is that maybe 15 minutes would 
be reasonable but a real 15 minutes, 
and we will start with that. 
Mr. WICKER. Hear! Hear! 
Mr. CARPER. Any objection? 
A SENATOR. Without objection. 
Mr. CARPER. All right. 
Madam 
President, I would ask that we make it 
a 15-minute vote, a real 15-minute vote. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2449 
Is there further debate? 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is on 
agreeing to the amendment. 
Is there a sufficient second?

ond?

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 327 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
our Nation is nearly $30 trillion in 
debt. That is $233,000 in debt for every 
American family. 
The American people are already 
feeling the pressure of rising inflation 
thanks to reckless government spend-
ing. And, make no mistake about it, in-
flation is a tax, a tax that hurts our

families on low and fixed incomes the 
most. 
I am hearing it from families across 
Florida who are worried. I heard from a 
dad in Jacksonville with three kids 
who is helping to temporarily take 
care of two other kids because their fa-
ther is out of work. As a result of hav-
ing five kids in his home, he has start-
ed working a second job to pay for all 
of the groceries that are rapidly in-
creasing in price. His second job is 
driving Uber, and that is less and less 
profitable by the day because of the 
rising price of gas. 
Over the weekend, the suspension on 
the Federal debt ceiling expired. That 
leaves Congress with two choices: Con-
tinue this reckless, wasteful spending 
with no accountability to the Amer-
ican people, or start making the tough 
choices to put our Nation on a success-
ful path. 
I know we can make the right 
choices and start moving America in a 
better direction. That is exactly what I 
did when I was Governor of Florida. 
Our State was on a bad path. I had to 
make difficult choices, but I paid down 
one-third of State debt, all while cut-
ting taxes 100 times. It can be done. 
Washington’s choice to keep raising 
or suspending the debt ceiling is like 
raising the limit on your credit card, 
month after month, with absolutely no 
plan to pay it off. It is irresponsible, 
and it is no way to operate. You would 
never run your business or family the 
way Washington runs. It is wasteful 
and dysfunctional. 
I came to Washington to rein in this 
exact type of dysfunction. We have to 
get our debt and spending under con-
trol. We need to make Washington 
work for families in Florida and all 
across the Nation. That is why I am 
leading my colleagues in a proposed 
rule change that would require every 
piece of legislation passed by a Senate 
committee to include a report on how 
it will impact inflation. 
It is very simple. When legislation, 
directly or indirectly, raises the cost of 
living or raises taxes on American fam-
ilies, families deserve to know. 
Too many in Washington believe the 
lie that inflation is impossible, debt 
doesn’t matter, and spending has no 
consequences. That is why this rule 
change is needed. 
This rule change is to protect that 
father in Jacksonville who is strug-
gling to get by. It is to protect those 
living on fixed incomes, low-income 
earners, and small businesses that 
can’t absorb cost increases. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Rules be 
discharged from further consideration 
and that the Senate now proceed to S. 
Res. 327. I ask unanimous consent that 
the resolution be agreed to, the pre-
amble be agreed to, and that the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to the unanimous consent 
request from the Senator of Florida. 
The amendment before us would 
change the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate and require additional reporting re-
quirements 
regarding 
inflation, 
a 
change which would substantially in-
crease the administrative burden on 
committees and staff and the process 
on the floor. 
We already have significant tools at 
our disposal to evaluate economic indi-
cators. We have economists at the De-
partment of Labor, Treasury Depart-
ment, Congressional Budget Office, 
Federal Reserve, and other Federal of-
fices regularly consulting with Con-
gress on issues about inflation and 
other economic indicators. This is to-
tally unnecessary. 
For these reasons, I oppose this reso-
lution and the request for unanimous 
consent. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2338 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
while I am disappointed that my col-
league won’t accept this measure, we 
do need to start doing something about 
inflation, and we can do that today 
with the infrastructure spending bill. 
We can all get behind real infrastruc-
ture—like roads, bridges, airports, and 
seaports—but we have to acknowledge 
that $1.2 trillion is a massive amount 
of taxpayer dollars, and we have to 
know exactly how this will impact 
families. 
I have been told by supporters of this 
infrastructure bill that it will not 
cause inflation. I will not support any-
thing that increases inflation on Amer-
ican families. I have an amendment to 
the infrastructure package that will re-
quire the Congressional Budget Office 
to certify that the spending in this bill 
will not increase inflation on the 
American people. 
If CBO does not certify that the 
spending authorized and appropriated 
in the bill would not increase inflation, 
my amendment would prohibit the 
funding from being obligated or spent, 
and the funds would instead be trans-
ferred to the Treasury Department for 
deficit reduction. 
I hope that everybody will get behind 
this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
time in opposition? 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield back my time. 
Mr. CARPER. Yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
is yielded back. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2338 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
Mr. LANKFORD. I ask for the yeas

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Senator 
CAPITO and I have a couple of com-
ments we would like to offer before we 
start on this amendment with Senator 
LEE, and that is we have consulted 
with both leaders, with Senator SCHU-
MER and Senator MCCONNELL. They are 
in agreement that 15 minutes firm is 
the vote. 
So when we start this vote, folks 
have 15 minutes to get here after we 
start the vote to vote, and if they are 
not here, they are too late. 
So that is the idea. We have spent 
way too much time waiting for people. 
We have three amendments lined up, 
and we are going to vote them and be 
punctual. 
Senator CAPITO. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Yes. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. 
I am in full support of using the 15- 
minute deadline that we have anyway 
and actually enforcing this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5816 
August 4, 2021 
There is a lot of interest in this bill, 
as there should be. There are a lot of 
amendments pending. We want to get 
as many Members in—and have their 
amendments in the queue—as we pos-
sibly can. 
But if people don’t come down and 
vote and show courtesy to everybody, I 
said in my last statement we are going 
to go to punitive measures. I am not 
sure voting within the allotted time is 
really a punitive measure, but that is 
what we are aiming for, and I am fully 
supportive of that. 
Mr. CARPER. Thank you. 
I would just ask any staff and Mem-
bers who are watching, staff, let your 
Senators know it is 15 minutes, and 
that is it. 
AMENDMENT NOS. 2279 AND 2358 TO AMENDMENT 
NO 2137 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
amendments be called up to the sub-
stitute and be reported by number: No. 
1 is Lee No. 2279; No. 2 is Rosen No. 
2358; further, that the Senate vote in 
relation to the amendments in the 
order listed, with no amendments in 
order to the amendments prior to a 
vote in relation to the amendments, 
with 60 affirmative votes required for 
the adoption of the Lee amendment 
listed and with up to 4 minutes, equal-
ly divided, prior to each vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2279 TO AMENDMENT NO. 2137 
(Purpose: To establish a project de-
livery program under the National En-
vironmental Policy Act of 1969 for 
water storage infrastructure projects.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Delaware [Mr. CARPER], 
for Mr. LEE, proposes an amendment num-
bered 2279 to the amendment No. 2137. 
(The amendment is printed in the 
RECORD of August 2, 2021 under ‘‘Text 
of Amendments.’’) 
AMENDMENT NO. 2358 TO AMENDMENT NO. 2137 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Delaware [Mr. CARPER], 
for Ms. ROSEN, proposes an amendment num-
bered 2358 to amendment No. 2137. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To modify a provision relating to 
providing support for activities to increase 
the resiliency of the National Highway 
System to mitigate the cost of damages 
from wildfires) 
On page 60, line 22, insert ‘‘wildfires,’’ after 
‘‘flooding,’’. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in reference 
to my amendment No. 2279, this is what 
we are trying to deal with here. 
In order to help expedite the review 
of projects that are subject to NEPA, 
Congress authorized in the FAST Act 
for States to assume the duties of con-
ducting the NEPA analysis. 
For example, the Federal Highway 
Administration has entered into agree-
ments with seven States—including 
Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, 
Ohio, Texas, and Utah—to assume this 
responsibility with great success, pro-
viding an opportunity for States to le-
verage their unique understanding of 
their own States in order to better 
carry out NEPA’s requirements. 
To build on this success, Congress 
should look to expand the ability of 
States to partner with the Federal 
Government for these types of reviews 
in their States’ water infrastructure 
projects. 
My amendment would require the De-
partment of the Interior to set up a 
program similar to the existing Sur-
face Transportation Project Delivery 
Program so that any State may volun-
tarily assume the Agency’s NEPA re-
sponsibilities for their water storage 
infrastructure projects. 
As I said just a moment ago, States 
already have a history of successfully 
conducting this work in the transpor-
tation space. 
In 2020, for example, California con-
ducted 33 environmental assessments, 
32 findings of no significant impact, 2 
environmental impact statements, 3 
records of decision, and the list goes on 
and on. 
In just the last half of 2020 alone, Ari-
zona conducted over 50 categorical ex-
clusion analyses. These are clearly 
roles that States are able and excited 
to handle. 
In fulfilling these responsibilities, 
States would be subject to the same 
rigorous environmental requirements 
as their Federal partners, employing 
the very same standards. Just as 
projects led by Federal Agencies can be 
halted due to insufficient NEPA anal-
ysis, States would also be held to the 
same standard. 
With much of the West experiencing 
severe drought, with dire consequences, 
allowing States to aid the Federal Gov-
ernment in NEPA review in order to 
expedite water storage infrastructure 
projects is not just common sense, it is 
a necessity. It is a matter of survival. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
amendment No. 2279. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment offered 
by our colleague from Utah. 
This amendment would undermine 
the National Environmental Policy 
Act, also known as NEPA, by allowing 
States to assume responsibility for un-
dertaking complex reviews of Federal 
action. These are reviews that Con-
gress vested explicitly in the Federal 
Agencies 
that 
permit 
or 
license 
projects that could adversely affect our 
environment. 
NEPA is designed to ensure that Fed-
eral Agencies consider major actions 
carefully to ensure those decisions do 
not unduly impact water quality, en-
dangered 
species, 
community 
well- 
being, air quality, and other environ-
mental resources. 
NEPA is a critical analytical tool 
that ensures that Federal decision 
makers are better informed and that 
the affected community has an oppor-
tunity to engage and be heard. 
Today, as the world is in the midst of 
a sixth great extinction event, and cli-
mate change is having ever greater im-
pacts on our natural world, we should 
be making decisions more carefully 
than ever, not just to improve out-
comes but also to avoid wasting money 
on projects that are not resilient to 
withstand climate change. 
This amendment would instead turn 
over responsibility for that critical 
analysis to the States. 
The bill before us includes many en-
vironmental deregulatory provisions— 
more, in fact, than many of us would 
prefer. However, it has been drafted in 
the spirit of bipartisan compromise. 
This bill, as drafted, includes provi-
sions to set deadlines for project review 
schedule in order to reduce project re-
view timelines. It provides or expands 
categorical exclusions from NEPA. It 
also permanently authorizes the Fed-
eral Permitting Improvement Steering 
Council. 
Unlike these provisions, which were 
the product of committee deliberation 
and compromise, the amendment that 
our friend from Utah has offered would 
significantly alter the process for Fed-
eral environmental review without any 
committee deliberation on such major 
changes. 
These sweeping changes are inappro-
priate and unwarranted, and I urge our 
colleagues to join me in voting no. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that for an additional 30 
seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is impor-
tant to remember these are the exact 
same standards that would apply. We 
do this all the time in other areas. Fed-
eral regulatory Agencies, on a con-
tinual basis, with the blessing of Con-
gress, are given authority to carry out 
a Federal program. 
In fact, we already do this with 
NEPA in the context of the Federal 
Highway Administration. 
This works. States are competent. It 
is a matter of expanding the human re-
sources to which we have access. 
These are the exact same standards. 
There is no environmental threat. This 
would just allow this stuff to get done 
faster. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2279 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to amendment 
No. 2279. 
Mr. LEE. I ask for the yeas and nays.

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The legislative clerk called the roll.

liamentary inquiry: How long did that 
last 15-minute vote take?

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
rollcall votes be 10 minutes in length. 
Mr. CARPER. I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The objection is heard. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me 
just take a minute from Senator CAP-
ITO to explain what is going on. OK? 
So lined up right now, we are going 
to do three voice votes. Negotiations 
are going forward on an amendment 
from Senator SCHUMER, related to the 
Commerce Committee’s jurisdiction. 
And after that, I think the last vote 
will be that of Senator FISCHER, and we 
will be done. 
And the reason why that is delayed is 
in order to provide time for negotiation 
to occur on the Schumer amendment 
with the Commerce Committee, and I 
think we are just about resolved. 
I don’t like it. It is what it is. 
I just want to thank all for your pa-
tience. We are close to the end. 
I would just ask, when we ask for a 
voice vote on the amendment from 
Senator JACKY ROSEN, that we get a 
voice vote. And I would ask that when 
we ask for a voice vote on the Carper- 
Inhofe amendment, we get a voice vote. 
And beyond that, we will be halfway 
home, halfway home. 
So thank you for your patience. We 
are almost there. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, there 
will now be 4 minutes of debate, equal-

Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me

AMENDMENT NO. 2358 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, there 
will now be 4 minutes of debate, equal-
ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to 
the Rosen amendment No. 2358. 
The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, last sum-
mer, the United States saw up close 
the horrific damage that wildfires can 
do to our communities. In 2020, nearly 
300,000 acres in Nevada burned to the 
ground. Right now, the Tamarack fire 
is devastating the Nevada-California 
border and local communities. 
These natural disasters have done 
real, lasting damage to our Nation’s 
highways, causing cracks, potholes, 
and, in some cases, literally melting 
the roads that we drive on. 
My colleague Senator RISCH and I 
offer this bipartisan amendment to the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, which would add wildfires as a 
specified damage for which Federal as-
sistance from the National Highway 
Performance Program may be used to 
rebuild our highways. 
This will provide support to increase 
the resiliency of the national highway 
system, helping to mitigate the cost of 
the damages. 
I ask all of my colleagues to support 
this amendment. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there further debate? 
Mr. CARPER. I rise in support of this 
amendment. I hope we will get every-
body to vote for it. Let’s do a voice 
vote so we can move on. 
Mrs. CAPITO. I am in support also as 
a ranking member. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2358 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Hearing no further debate, the 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
The amendment (No. 2358) was agreed 
to. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Delaware. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2447 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
now to discuss my amendment with 
Senators 
INHOFE, 
WICKER, 
and 
DUCKWORTH. 
This 
amendment 
makes 
several 
changes to the appropriations section 
of the substitute in the section that 
funds the Army Corps of Engineers. 
In WRDA 2020, Senator BARRASSO and 
I heard multiple times about the strug-
gles of small, rural, and economically 
disadvantaged communities in meeting 
project cost shares. These projects 
range from aquatic ecosystem restora-
tions to flood control and new levees. 
Yet because the Corps is required to 
cost share the work, these small, rural, 
and poor communities never get the as-
sistance they need. 
Last year, Senator BARRASSO and I 
created a cap authority that allows the 
Corps to pay for full expense of these 
projects to help these disadvantaged 
communities finance the infrastruc-
ture the community needs. 
This amendment also makes clari-
fying changes to the inland waterways 
funding. In addition to a technical cor-
rection, it makes clear that the fund-
ing provided in this act must be 
prioritized for projects on the Capital 
Investment Strategy Report, the guid-
ing document for the Corps inland wa-
terways projects. 
Finally, this amendment makes sure 
that 
inland 
flooding 
projects 
are 
prioritized for economically disadvan-
taged communities and life-safety-re-
lated projects. This supports equity for 
disadvantaged 
communities 
while 
prioritizing projects with the highest 
need. 
This is a good bill. It is a good 
amendment, and these small tweaks 
make it stronger. 
I urge my colleagues to support our 
amendment and hope that we might do 
so unanimously. 
Senator INHOFE would be here. He is 
in Oklahoma with his family right 
now. I think some would understand 
that. He urges us to support this as 
well. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there further debate? 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2564 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The question is on agreeing to 
the amendment No. 2564. 
The amendment (No. 2564) was agreed 
to. 
Mr. CARPER. With that, Mr. Presi-
dent, I would suggest the absence of a 
quorum, waiting for the arrival of Sen-
ator BENNET, who will be here momen-
tarily. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Under the previous order, there will 
now be 2 minutes of debate equally di-
vided prior to a vote in relation to Ben-
net-Hoeven amendment 2548.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5819 
August 4, 2021 
AMENDMENT NO. 2548 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about Bennet-Hoeven amend-
ment 2548. 
Our amendment would formally es-
tablish the Joint Chiefs Program at 
USDA. I know a lot of people haven’t 
heard of this initiative, but it is really, 
really important. 
As I have said on this floor before, in 
Western 
States 
like 
Colorado 
and 
North Dakota, our forests and our 
grasslands are as important to our 
economy as the Lincoln Tunnel or the 
Brooklyn Bridge are to New York, but 
they haven’t received nearly enough 
investment over the years. The result 
is that we have people on the ground 
across the West who are working with 
incredibly constrained resources. But, 
despite their best effort, there is a lot 
of important work to maintain the 
health of our forests and grasslands 
that they are unable to do. The con-
sequences of this have been terrible in 
the West. 
In Colorado, we had the three largest 
wildfires in our history last year. The 
fires were still burning when the snow 
fell, for the first time. That has never 
happened in anyone’s memory. 
As we consider this infrastructure 
bill tonight, one of the major east-west 
corridors in America is closed because 
of mudslides that poured down the 
burn scar from the wildfires last year. 
Now I–70 may be closed for weeks. 
We need to deal with this on the 
front end, and that is why the Joint 
Chiefs Program matters. At USDA, the 
Forest Service works mostly on public 
lands, while the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service supports efforts 
on private lands. Joint Chiefs allows 
them to work in a collaborative way. 
I thank Senator HOEVEN for his sup-
port, and I hope we will vote for this on 
voice vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to join with the Senator from 
Colorado on this Joint Chiefs Land-
scape Restoration Partnership Act. I 
appreciate his leadership. 
There are several points I want to 
make here before we vote, and that is, 
this program is very popular with land-
owners, and I think that is important. 
This is a very popular program with 
landowners. It is completely voluntary, 
a voluntary program. We have chatted 
with CBO. It does not score, so it does 
not have a score. Again, both the ma-
jority and minority on Ag agree and 
support this legislation. So, again, it is 
farmer-friendly, rancher-friendly, and 
popular with landowners. 
I thank the Senator from Colorado, 
and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2548 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The question is on agreeing to 
the amendment. 
The amendment (No. 2548) was agreed

AMENDMENT NOS. 2164 AND 2570 TO AMENDMENT 
NO. 2137 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, col-
leagues, I ask unanimous consent that 
the following amendments be called up 
to the substitute and be reported by 
number. The first of those is Fischer, 
2164, with Cortez Masto—is that cor-
rect? Yes—and the second is Schumer, 
2570; further, that the Senate vote in 
relation to the amendments in the 
order listed, with no amendments in 
order to the amendments prior to a 
vote in relation to the amendments, 
with up to 2 minutes equally divided 
prior to each vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

will now be 2 minutes of debate equally 
divided prior to a vote in relation to 
the Fischer amendment, No. 2164. 
The Senator from Nebraska. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2164 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I 
thank Senator CARPER
and Senator 
CAPITO for the work they have been 
doing here on the floor. I appreciate 
their diligence in trying to get amend-
ments up. 
I am glad to offer this bipartisan 
amendment with my colleague from 
Nevada. It would promote transparency 
among all Federal funding avenues for 
broadband infrastructure deployment. 
Right now, funding is divided among 
several Agencies: FCC, NTIA, USDA, 
HHS, Treasury, and many others. Some 
of these programs have detailed maps 
of where funding is going, but some do 
not. Even when there are maps, it still 
requires searching through several web 
pages and sources to find out what you 
are looking for, if you can find it at all. 
Without a clear picture of where the 
funding is going, it will be increasingly 
difficult to avoid duplication and dis-
tribute resources where they are need-
ed the most. So our amendment would 
create an online mapping tool through 
an interagency process so we can view 
the latest progress of all of these de-
ployment projects in one place. I would 
urge adoption of the amendment. 
Thank you. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I join my colleague from Nebraska in 
support of this bipartisan amendment. 
Transparency around broadband is so 
important for all of our communities, 
and it fits with, I think, what we are 
all doing to address our broadband 
needs across the country and trying to 
ensure we are bringing broadband into 
the communities most in need. So I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I under-
stand there has been a request—let me 
ask the Senator. 
I understand there has been a request 
for a recorded vote. Can you confirm 
that or not? 
Mrs. 
FISCHER. A recorded vote 
would be fine. 
Mr. CARPER. All right. Then it will 
be a recorded vote. 
Let me ask our colleagues: 10 min-
utes; is that OK? Ten minutes from 
start to finish, and that is it. And the 
last amendment will be Schumer. All 
right? Let’s do this in 10 minutes, OK? 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2164 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The question is on agreeing to 
the amendment. 
Mr. THUNE. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

AMENDMENT NO. 2570 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, there 
will be 2 minutes of debate, equally di-
vided, prior to the vote in relation to 
the Schumer amendment, No. 2570. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise in support of this amendment. It is 
a bipartisan amendment with Senator 
WICKER. And this is about just giving 
basic 
safety 
regulations 
to 
those 
superlong, stretch limousines. 
The reason why Senator SCHUMER 
and I care about this, there was a hor-
rible, horrible incident in Upstate New 
York, in Schoharie, where 20 people 
were killed. In that 1 limousine, 17 pas-
sengers: 4 young women from the same 
family—a mom lost 4 daughters—and 2 
recently married couples. They hired 
the limousine to go safely to a birth-
day party. 
This cannot continue. 
And I yield to Senator WICKER. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I, too, 
rise in support of this amendment. It is 
in response to a tragic automobile ac-
cident that affected a number of fami-
lies. 
I want to thank Senator SCHUMER’s 
staff for working with me, the ranking 
member, and the chair of the Com-
merce Committee to get this language 
correct. It is in good shape. I entirely 
agree with the junior Senator from 
New York. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2570 
Mr. CORNYN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be to be a sufficient 
second.

The amendment (No. 2570) was agreed 
to. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I close, I have some brief remarks. 
First, on the bill that just passed, let 
me thank my colleagues for passing 
this very important bill. 
It stems from the fact that, in 2018, 20 
lives were lost in a tragic limousine ac-
cident in Schoharie, NY. The families 
came from the small city of Amster-
dam, the people. They had done just 
the right thing. It is a group that went 
out. They knew they might be enjoying 
themselves, and so they hired a big, 
long stretch limo. Unfortunately, as 
the limo came down the hill in 
Schoharie, it crashed, and 20 people 
died. 
I met the families. These were young 
people in the prime of life. I met one 
mom. She lost four daughters—four 
daughters—in this crash. This commu-
nity of Amsterdam and these families 
have endured endless tragedy. 
But instead of cursing the darkness, 
they have lit a candle, and they are 
pushing for the fact that there is a hole 
in regulation. We regulate trucks, and 
we regulate smaller limos, but when it 
is a large limo, and they are not sure 
what it is classified as, then there is 
virtually no regulation. This legisla-
tion fills that hole. The accident was 
preventable. 
There was another accident on Long 
Island—four young women in the prime 
of life killed in the same way. That was 
preventable. 
Now Congress finally has the oppor-
tunity to address the gaps and loop-
holes that have allowed limousines to 
escape the basic safety standards that 
cover other vehicles. 
My amendment—and that with Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND—would ensure that 
limousines 
meet 
minimum 
safety 
standards. It mandates seatbelts and 
seat safety standards, and it will save 
lives. So I thank my colleagues for sup-
porting this amendment. 
It is a beautiful thing what these 
families are doing. The hole in their 
heart will never go away. The hole in 
the heart of the whole city of Amster-
dam, which lost so many of their vital 
young men and women, will never go 
away. But instead of cursing the dark-
ness, they are lighting the candle, and, 
tonight, the candle was lit thanks to 
the bipartisan cooperation we have 
here. So I thank my colleagues. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. President, now on the matter of 
today, the Senate is making really 
good progress, really good progress. As 
you know, I had promised, when we 
opened up our two-track process, that 
we would be fully bipartisan in the 
amendment process as we move for-
ward on the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. Well, I think no one can deny that 
we have kept our word here in the 
Democratic majority. 
So far, the Senate has considered 22 
amendments on this bipartisan piece of 
legislation, 15 of them today. That is 
more amendments than probably hap-
pened in many months when we were in 
the minority. Of those amendments, 12 
have been agreed to—5 by voice vote, 7 
by rollcall; 10 were not agreed to; 13 of 
those 
22 
amendments—more 
than 
half—were sponsored by Republicans. 
So, clearly, we have shown a willing-
ness to allow Members who are not 
part of the bipartisan group to have 
input into this important bill. 
Tomorrow, we will continue to con-
sider amendments, and then, hopefully, 
we can bring this bill to a close in the 
very near future. 
So the Chamber is working as Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle have 
wanted it to. I am proud of what we 
have been able to do today and hope we 
can continue tomorrow in that vein.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO BILL CAMERON 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, August 
20 will be the end of an era in Chicago 
as WLS 890 AM political reporter Bill 
Cameron puts his microphone down 
after a 51-year career on the radio. Bill 
is the ‘‘Dean’’ of Chicago political re-
porters, joining the city hall beat in 
1970 and covering all the major stories 
in Chicago since that time. The an-
nouncement of his pending retirement 
brought praise for Bill’s legendary ca-
reer, with one colleague calling him a 
‘‘walking 
encyclopedia 
of 
political 
knowledge.’’ 
When asked by a fellow reporter how 
he had survived his first 50 years in the 
industry, Bill said he took inspiration 
in advice from Chicago Cubs legend 
Ernie Banks: ‘‘Find something you love 
to do and stick with it.’’ Stick with it; 
he certainly did. Bill earned the admi-
ration of his peers for his ability to 
elicit honest answers from his inter-
view subjects. Bill always finds a way 
to cut to the heart of an issue and de-
liver insightful reports for his lis-
teners. 
Bill and I are both natives of East St. 
Louis, IL, though we never met until 
my Senate election and his Chicago 
beat brought us together. Bill’s father 
Fred was a successful high school foot-
ball coach, winning more than 100 
games for the storied East St. Louis 
Flyers. Instead of following his father’s 
footsteps 
into 
football, 
Bill 
chose 
broadcast journalism, earning a bach-
elor’s degree at Indiana University. 
And we are all the better for it. 
Bill started as a news writer for NBC 
5 in Chicago in 1969 but left TV for 
good the next year, signing on at the 
former WMAQ 670 AM. He was there 
until the station switched to an all- 
sports format in 2000, making the jump 
to WLS. Bill’s legendary career in-
cludes two Edward R. Murrow Awards, 
a Peabody Award, and countless other 
accolades. In addition to his day-to-day 
duties covering the city hall beat for 
WLS, Bill is the host of the station’s 
weekly public affairs show, ‘‘Connected 
to Chicago.’’ 
Bill has covered numerous mayors, 
Governors—and even U.S. Senators—in 
his career. He has been there for elec-
tion nights, policy press conferences, 
breaking news, and jury verdicts. He 
has seen it all in 50-plus years of broad-
casting. So what does he want to see 
now in retirement? Bill says it is time 
to go see more National Parks. 
Well, Bill, I hope you enjoy all the 
beauty that our National Parks have to 
offer you in retirement. I will miss 
your questions at press conferences and 
our lively discussions about the issues 
of the day on ‘‘Connected to Chicago.’’ 
You certainly found something you 
loved and stuck with it, and you did it 
with class. 
Enjoy your retirement.

AMENDMENT NO. 2478 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, if there had 
been a recorded vote on amendment 
No. 2478 to amendment No. 2137 to H.R. 
3684, ‘‘To require the Minority Business 
Development Agency of the Depart-
ment of Commerce to promote and ad-
minister programs in the public and 
private sectors to assist the develop-
ment of minority business enterprises 
and to ensure that such Agency has the 
necessary supporting resources, par-
ticularly during economic downturns,’’ 
I would have voted nay.

This proposed sale serves U.S. national, 
economic, and security interests by sup-
porting the recipient’s continuing efforts to 
modernize its armed forces and to maintain 
a credible defensive capability. The proposed 
sale will help improve the security of the re-
cipient and assist in maintaining political 
stability, military balance, economic and 
progress in the region. 
This proposed sale of M109A6 SPH will con-
tribute to the modernization of the recipi-
ent’s self-propelled howitzer fleet, enhancing 
its ability to meet current and future 
threats. These systems will contribute to the 
recipient’s goal of updating its military ca-
pability while further enhancing interoper-

offsets. At this time, agreements are unde-
termined and will be defined in negotiations 
between the purchaser and contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the permanent assignment of any 
additional U.S. Government or contractor 
representatives to recipient. Support teams 
will travel to recipient on a temporary basis. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–44 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Paladin M109A6 howitzer is the fifth 
product improvement to the original M109 
self-propelled howitzer. It features improve-
ments in the areas of survivability; reli-
ability, availability, and maintainability 
(RAM); responsiveness; and terminal effects. 
The M109A6 is an armored, full tracked how-
itzer carrying 37 complete conventional 
rounds and two Copperhead projectiles and is 
operated by a crew of four. It is designed 
with a new turret structure that facilitates 
integration of the various turret improve-
ments and vulnerability reduction measures. 
It improves overall crew compartment lay-
out and space. The howitzer can travel at a 
maximum speed of 38 miles per hour and has 
a maximum cruising range of 186 miles. The 
M109A6 can operate independently, on the 
move, it can receive a fire mission, compute 
firing data, select and take up its firing posi-
tion, automatically unlock and point its can-
non, fire and move—all without external 
technical assistance. Firing the first round 
following a move in under 60 seconds, a 
‘‘shoot and scoot’’ capability protects the 
crew from counterbattery fire. The M109A6 is 
capable of firing up to four rounds per 
minute to ranges of 30 kilometers. The 
M109A6 
features 
increased 
survivability 
characteristics such as day/night operability, 
Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) protec-
tion with climate control and secure voice 
and digital communications. The crew re-
mains in the vehicle throughout the mission. 
2. The Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) com-
ponent provides the vehicle with its own po-
sition location utilizing sensors that con-
tinuously calculates its direction and veloc-
ity without the continuous dependency of a 
GPS; the INU receives GPS data from an ex-
ternal GPS receiver as an input when avail-
able to provide better precision. The INU al-
lows the vehicle to more precisely calculate

its position to other components in the vehi-
cle to improve its functions and safety of 
use; these functions include movement and 
maneuver of the vehicle, movement of the 
turret, and pointing of the gun tube. 
3. The Electronic Fire Control System 
(EFCS) commonly referred to as the Paladin 
Fire Control System (PFCS) is the major 
change for the Paladin M109A6 Howitzer 
from the manual fire control system used on 
the M109A5. This gives the howitzer the abil-
ity to operate over a widely dispersed area 
and to move and emplace using the on board 
fire control navigation and GPS system. The 
M109A6 can move and position within an as-
signed position area, process technical firing 
data, and fire a mission without relying on 
aiming circles and wire lines. The M109A6 
can change position more frequently, an ad-
vantage against enemy fire. Such advance-
ments give new meaning to the artillery’s 
ability to move, shoot and communicate. In 
addition, the EFCS with embedded elec-
tronic diagnostics improves maintenance 
and repair functions by assisting in pin-
pointing faults. 
4. The Defense Advanced GPS (Global Posi-
tioning System) Receiver (DAGR) is a light-
weight (less than 2 pounds) hand-held or host 
platform-mounted, dual frequency (L1/L2), 
Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module 
(SAASM) based, Precise Positioning Service 
(PPS) device that receives and decodes the 
L1 and L2 signals-in-space which are trans-
mitted by the NAVSTAR GPS satellite con-
stellation. The DAGR provides real-time po-
sitioning, velocity (ground speed), naviga-
tion, and timing (PVNT) information, in 
stand-alone 
(dismounted) 
and 
mounted 
(ground facilities, sea, air, and land vehicles) 
configurations. The DAGR can support mis-
sions involving land-based war-fighting and 
non-war fighting operations. The DAGR can 
also be used as a secondary or supplemental 
aid to aviation-based missions which involve 
operations in low-dynamic aircraft, and as 
an aid to navigation in water-borne oper-
ations. 
5. The M1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) 
is a Global Positioning System (GPS) Guid-
ance Kit with fuzing functions for the M795 
and M549A1 155mm High Explosive (HE) Ar-
tillery Projectiles. The PGK corrects the bal-
listic trajectory of the projectile to reduce 
delivery errors and thus improves projectile 
accuracy. The PGK will effectively reduce 
target delivery error of conventional artil-
lery munitions and reduce the number of 
projectiles required to execute a fire mis-
sion. 
6. The 155mm M232A1 Propelling Charge 
(DODIC DA13), will be used in M109 series 
howitzers. The Modular Artillery Charge 
System (MACS) consists of two propelling 
charge module types, the M231 and the M232/ 
M232A1, and their associated packaging. The 
system is compatible with all current and 
planned 155mm field artillery weapons. 
7. The M82 Percussion Primer (DODIC 
N523) will be used in M109 series howitzers. 
8. The International Field Artillery Tac-
tical Data System is the international ex-
port version of the Army’s Advanced Field 
Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). 
It provides networked and fully automated 
support for the planning, coordination, con-
trol, and execution of fires and effects such 
as mortars, field artillery, rockets and mis-
siles, and close air support. International 
versions are developed for each customer 
unique to the weapon and targeting systems 
in their inventory. 
9. Field Artillery Ammunition Support Ve-
hicle (FAASV) M992A2 this ammunition ve-
hicle has no turret, but has a taller super-
structure to store 95 rounds with a cor-
responding number of powders and primers. 
Until recently, much of the remaining inter-
nal crew space was taken up by a hydrau-
lically powered conveyor system designed to 
allow the quick uploading of rounds or their 
transfer to the M109–series howitzer. 
10. Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat 
Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HER-
CULES) Improved Recovery Vehicle—M88A2 
recovers tanks mired to different depths re-
moves and replaces tank turrets and power 
packs, and uprights overturned heavy com-
bat vehicles. The main winch of the M88A2 is 
capable of a 70-ton, single-line recovery, al-
lowing the HERCULES to provide recovery 
of the 70-Ton M1A2 Abrams Tank. 
11. The A-frame boom and hoist winch of 
the M88A2 can lift 35 tons. The spade can be 
used to anchor the vehicle when using the 
main winch and can be used for light earth 
moving to prepare a recovery area. The 
M88A2 employs an auxiliary power unit to 
provide auxiliary electrical and hydraulic 
power when the main engine is not in oper-
ation. It can also be used to slave start other 
vehicles, as well as a means to refuel or 
defuel 
vehicles. 
The 
M88A2 
can 
refuel 
Abrams tanks from its own fuel tank. 
12. The Browning M2 is an air-cooled, belt- 
fed machine gun. The M2 fires from a closed 
bolt, operated on the short recoil principle.

TRIBUTE TO ARNOLD POSTOVIT 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, it is a 
great honor for me to recognize a 
North Dakota hero who will celebrate 
his 100th birthday on August 20. Arnold 
Postovit of Tioga is one of our State’s 
most treasured residents who has expe-
rienced many great moments in our 
State’s and Nation’s history. 
Raised during the Great Depression 
on a farm near the town of Plaza, Ar-
nold remembers days where the grass-
hoppers were so thick they blocked the 
sun. In an oral interview in 1999, this 
World War II veteran shared details 
about his military service. 
Arnold graduated from Plaza High 
School and spent a semester at the 
University of North Dakota before de-
ciding he wanted to be a pilot. This led 
him and a few friends to the Army re-
cruiting center in Bismarck in the 
summer of 1940. With no openings in 
Army Air Corps units, he enlisted in 
the infantry and never left the 7th In-
fantry, 3rd Division. 
He trained with a mortar unit in 
Washington State, going on manuevers 
and practicing boat landings on Puget 
Sound. In January 1941, he was trans-
ferred to Fort Lewis and was on leave 
in Tacoma on December 7, when the 
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. In 
early 1942, he trained near San Diego 
for several months, which included 
desert maneuvers. Traveling by train 
to Virginia, it was in November 1942 
when his battalion boarded the USS 
Thomas Jefferson and landed in North 
Africa 3 weeks later. There, he was was 
among those who conducted night pa-
trols around Casablanca. Following 
more training, Arnold and his division 
sailed the Mediterranean Sea toward 
Tunis to prepare for the invasion of 
Sicily in July 1943. His landing craft in-
fantry came under heavy German ma-
chinegun fire as they came ashore. He 
also 
saw 
action 
in 
Palermo 
and 
Messina, Italy, where he remembers 
heavy fighting and the cold weather at 
Christmastime. 
‘‘We were young and tough,’’ Arnold 
recalled in 1999. ‘‘There was a lot of 
rain and we got sick from being wet 
and from the dysentery that would 
break out.’’ 
His life would change after his unit 
landed behind German lines in Anzio, 
Italy, in January 1944. Hitler sent some 
of his best battle-hardened troops to 
push back this surprise attack by the 
Allied Forces. On February 6, German 
troops captured Arnold and a dozen 
other soldiers. He was transferred to a 
nearby POW camp that held many 
other American and British soldiers. 
A few weeks later, trucks took him 
and other POWs on a 4-day trip to 
northern Germany to the Stalag 2B 
camp. After a few months, he and 16 
other soldiers were taken by train to a 
working farm, where he did general 
farm work for nearly a year. In the 
spring of 1945, as Soviet troops invaded 
Germany from the east, Arnold and a 
thousand other soldiers were marched 
west across Germany. They came close 
to the North Sea and kept warm in 
nearby barns during the cold nights. 
After marching 600 miles, Arnold and 
some other soldiers saw an opportunity 
to escape to a nearby small town near 
the Elbe River on April 12. They hid in 
abandoned 
buildings 
and 
the 
next 
morning flagged down a small Amer-
ican plane that was flying over. They 
were told to stay where they were be-
cause 
American 
troops 
would 
be 
marching through later that day. When 
they connected with the Americans, 
the first thing the soldiers did was 
throw those thin and sick prisoners of 
war cans of C-rations to eat. Eventu-
ally, they were flown to Le Harve, 
France, and went to nearby Camp 
Lucky Strike, where released prisoners 
of war were taken to regain their 
health. Arnold was among other North 
Dakota soldiers who then sailed with 
thousands of others to Newport News, 
VA, on a converted transport ship. 
Following his Army discharge, Ar-
nold returned home to farm with his 
father, who by then lived near White 
Earth, ND. He planted the crops and

his father took care of the livestock. 
Married 6 years later, he and his wife 
Marjorie raised a family of five chil-
dren. Although it was difficult to ad-
just after his wartime and POW experi-
ences, Arnold made the best of his op-
portunities and cherished being an 
American. ‘‘After you lose your free-
dom, then you understand what free-
dom means,’’ he said. ‘‘Americans are 
free, even if we sometimes think we 
aren’t.’’ 
In May 2009, Arnold participated with 
other North Dakota World War II vet-
erans in an Honor Flight that took 
them to the World War II Memorial 
and other sites in Washington, DC. 
Arnold Postovit is one of 60,000 North 
Dakotans who served in the U.S. 
Armed Forces during World War II. Of 
those, nearly 2,000 gave their lives for 
our freedom in this largest and dead-
liest conflict in world history. With 
only some 500 World War II veterans 
still alive today in North Dakota, the 
heroism of every single one of them is 
appreciated more than ever. 
Throughout his life, Arnold has em-
bodied the best of the Greatest Genera-
tion. He has lived a meaningful life, 
sharing his story as a World War II sol-
dier so the rest of us can better under-
stand and appreciate the selfless serv-
ice and sacrifice each and every vet-
eran has made. On behalf of all North 
Dakotans, I wish Arnold Postovit a 
very happy 100th birthday on August 20 
and many more years of health and vi-
tality. As he celebrates with his family 
and many friends in Tioga on August 
22, I honor him as one of North Dako-
ta’s most exemplary citizens.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SUSAN ERLICHMAN 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to recognize the extraordinary ca-
reer of Susan Erlichman, Esquire, the 
executive director of the Maryland 
Legal Services Corporation, on the eve 
of her retirement after 32 years of re-
markable public service. Susan is a de-
voted public servant and tireless advo-
cate for civil legal services for those 
who need them most in the State of 
Maryland. 
The Maryland Legal Services Cor-
poration—MLSC—is the state’s largest 
funder of civil legal aid. Its mission, as 
established by the Maryland General 
Assembly, is ensuring that low-income 
Marylanders have access to reliable, 
productive, and worthwhile civil legal 
assistance by distributing and over-
seeing grants to nonprofits statewide. 
Since its creation in 1982, MLSC has 
distributed grants totaling over $312 
million. In turn, grantees have assisted 
Marylanders in more than 3.5 million 
legal matters, ranging from family to 
housing to employment to healthcare 
cases, in which they would otherwise 
have been hard-pressed to access legal 
aid. 
Susan Erlichman’s career with the 
MLSC spanned an incredible 32 years, 
including 17 as the organization’s exec-
utive director. During her tenure in 
that position, Susan oversaw the tri-
pling of MLSC’s annual budget, from $6 
million to $20 million. She also helped 
to found a robust working relationship 
between the Administrative Office of 
the Courts and MLSC that signifi-
cantly expanded Maryland’s Judicare 
Family Law program and the number 
of residents it serves. Perhaps one of 
her greatest accomplishments, how-
ever, was pioneering an innovative pro-
gram to remove barriers to employ-
ment in Maryland by placing civil legal 
aid lawyers in projects aimed at the 
fostering of more productive and pros-
perous workforces. 
From the 2008 recession to our cur-
rent-day COVID–19 pandemic, Susan’s 
drive, tenacity, and compassion has 
been an invaluable asset to our state. 
Through the projects I have mentioned 
and the countless others that she has 
led, Susan has utilized her institu-
tional insight and diplomatic skills to 
bring together a wide coalition of allies 
to support and strengthen civil legal 
services. Susan has been an incredible 
leader to MLSC staff, even during the 
hardest of times. 
Access to justice is a significant, 
growing challenge in Maryland and na-
tionwide that has only been exacer-
bated by the COVID–19 pandemic. In 
most cases, low-income Americans re-
ceive inadequate or no legal help due 
to lack of available resources, even 
though they are eligible and entitled to 
this legal assistance. During the pan-
demic, the Legal Services Corpora-
tion—LSC—reported that 94 percent of 
grantees surveyed said they were pro-
viding services to clients who were 
newly eligible for legal aid during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. I credit Susan and 
the excellent work of MLSC with mak-
ing it as easy as possible for me to ad-
vocate for Federal funding. Her work 
and that of her peers nationwide has 
generated bipartisan support in Con-
gress that was significant enough to 
turn back an effort to disband the 
agency entirely in the last administra-
tion. There is no doubt that Susan’s 
leadership has allowed MLSC to endure 
as a beacon of hope in the face of the 
surge in demand since the start of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
The MLSC is an organization near 
and dear to my heart. From August 
1988 through June 1995, I was privileged 
to serve as its chair. Previously, I 
chaired a task force that produced an 
Action Plan for Legal Services to 
Maryland’s Poor in January of 1988. 
Many recommendations from the ac-
tion plan, such as conversion of the In-
terest on Lawyer Trust Account— 
IOLTA—program from voluntary to 
mandatory, were ultimately adopted. I 
enjoyed working with Susan, who coin-
cidentally joined the organization in 
1988, to implement the action plan and 
make other improvements. Although I 
moved on from MLSC a few years later, 
I was happy to know the organization 
was in such good hands. I am also con-
fident that Susan’s successor, Deb Selt-
zer, will continue Susan’s legacy and 
make great progress towards achieving 
the mission of the MLSC. 
In announcing Susan’s retirement, 
MLSC board chair Natalie McSherry 
had this to say: ‘‘Susan Erlichman is a 
giant among all leaders of IOLTA and 
other funding entities for civil legal 
services. 
We 
have 
been 
incredibly 
blessed to have had the benefit of her 
leadership for so many years.’’ It is 
clear that Susan’s impact on the Mary-
land Legal Services Corporation, and 
the State of Maryland for that matter, 
will be felt for years to come. For that, 
I sincerely thank her for her service to 
our State’s citizens and wish her a 
happy and well-deserved retirement.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 336—DESIG-
NATING SEPTEMBER 15, 2021, AS 
‘‘INTERNATIONAL 
MYOTONIC 
DYSTROPHY AWARENESS DAY’’ 
AND 
SUPPORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND IDEALS OF INTERNATIONAL 
MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY AWARE-
NESS DAY 
Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 336 
Whereas myotonic dystrophy is a rare, 
multi-systemic, inherited disease that af-
fects approximately 1 in 2,100 people and a 
total of 150,000 individuals in the United 
States; 
Whereas there are well over 1,000,000 people 
living with myotonic dystrophy globally, yet 
thousands of people do not know they have 
the disease and are in need of care; 
Whereas myotonic dystrophy is the most 
common form of adult muscular dystrophy 
and the symptoms of myotonic dystrophy be-
come more severe with each generation; 
Whereas 
the 
disease 
is 
caused 
by 
mutations in the DMPK gene and the CNBP 
gene, resulting in myotonic dystrophy type 1 
and myotonic dystrophy type 2, respectively; 
Whereas those mutations prevent the 
DMPK gene and the CNBP gene from func-
tioning properly, impacting multiple body 
systems; 
Whereas 
the 
genetic 
mutations 
are 
autosomal dominant mutations, where a sin-
gle copy of the altered gene is sufficient to 
cause the disorder, and affected individuals 
have a 50 percent chance of passing on the 
mutated gene to their children; 
Whereas, through this inherited genetic 
anomaly, individuals with myotonic dys-
trophy experience varied and complex symp-
toms, including skeletal muscle problems,

excessive daytime sleepiness, early cataracts 
and heart, breathing, digestive, hormonal, 
speech, swallowing, diabetic, immune, vi-
sion, and cognitive difficulties; 
Whereas myotonic dystrophy is a highly 
variable and complicated disorder in which 
the younger an individual is when symptoms 
first appear, the more severe symptoms are 
likely to be, with progressively more severe 
symptoms occurring after the earlier symp-
toms are experienced; 
Whereas misdiagnoses of myotonic dys-
trophy have persisted for decades, and delays 
in diagnosing myotonic dystrophy are com-
mon; 
Whereas there are currently no treatments 
for myotonic dystrophy approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration; 
Whereas, in 2007, the Myotonic Dystrophy 
Foundation was founded with a mission to 
enhance the quality of life of people living 
with myotonic dystrophy and to accelerate 
research focused on finding treatments and a 
cure; 
Whereas, in 2014, Congress reauthorized the 
Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Com-
munity Assistance, Research, and Education 
Amendments of 2014 (Public Law 113–166; 42 
U.S.C. 201), which increased muscular dys-
trophy research funding and public health 
surveillance 
activities, 
including 
for 
myotonic dystrophy; 
Whereas, in September 2017, recognizing 
the seriousness of myotonic dystrophy and 
the especially disabling impact of myotonic 
dystrophy on individuals with congenital 
myotonic dystrophy, the Social Security Ad-
ministration added congenital myotonic dys-
trophy to the Compassionate Allowances 
program that allows individuals to quickly 
qualify for disability benefits, including 
health insurance coverage; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress added myotonic 
dystrophy to the list of eligible conditions 
for research funding under the Peer Re-
viewed Medical Research Program of the De-
partment of Defense, which resulted in more 
than $6,000,000 in new research awards; 
Whereas funding for myotonic dystrophy 
research supported by the National Insti-
tutes of Health remained flat between 2010 
and 2020 with the agency awarding $24,000,000 
in research grants in fiscal year 2020; and 
Whereas increased Federal funding for 
myotonic dystrophy research will improve 
health outcomes, reduce disability, and in-
crease life expectancy for individuals living 
with myotonic dystrophy and holds great 
promise for helping individuals with similar 
genetic diseases: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 15, 2021 as ‘‘Inter-
national Myotonic Dystrophy Awareness 
Day’’; and 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Inter-
national Myotonic Dystrophy Awareness 
Day, including— 
(A) committing to promoting and advanc-
ing the health, well-being, and inherent dig-
nity of all children and adults with myotonic 
dystrophy; 
(B) supporting the advancement of sci-
entific and medical myotonic dystrophy re-
search at the National Institutes of Health 
and as part of the Peer Reviewed Medical Re-
search Program of the Department of De-
fense; 
(C) fostering biopharmaceutical innovation 
that will lead to treatments approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration and eventu-
ally a cure for myotonic dystrophy; 
(D) advancing programs and policies that 
assist individuals disabled by myotonic dys-
trophy and the caregivers of those individ-
uals; and 
(E) encouraging awareness and education 
of myotonic dystrophy among patients, care-
givers, clinicians, and researchers. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, myotonic 
dystrophy is a rare, multi-systemic, 
progressive, inherited disease that af-
fects successive family generations but 
is often misdiagnosed. Affecting as 
many 
as 
1 
in 
2,100 
individuals, 
myotonic dystrophy is the most com-
mon form of adult muscular dystrophy. 
However, there is currently no cure 
and there are no Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) approved treat-
ments. 
Today, I am pleased to introduce the 
first ever U.S. Senate resolution desig-
nating September 15th as International 
Myotonic Dystrophy Awareness Day. 
The resolution will help to highlight 
the devastating generational impact of 
this disease, focus global attention on 
accelerating drug discovery, and work 
to advance healthcare for our commu-
nity. 
Caused by an inherited genetic anom-
aly, individuals with myotonic dys-
trophy experience varied and complex 
symptoms, from locked muscles, to 
heart, breathing, digestive, hormonal, 
and cognitive difficulties. It is not un-
common for older family members to 
only be tested following the birth of an 
affected child, and despite the avail-
ability 
of 
simple 
genetic 
tests, 
misdiagnoses can persist for decades. 
The different body systems affected, 
the severity of symptoms, and the age 
of onset of those symptoms varies 
greatly between individuals, even with-
in the same family. Many of these indi-
viduals live with debilitating symp-
toms yet in the majority of situations, 
they 
never 
receive 
adequate 
or 
proactive medical care which could 
dramatically improve their quality of 
life. 
More research is desperately needed 
to change this reality. Virginia-based 
researchers are among the global lead-
ers 
working 
to 
better 
understand 
myotonic dystrophy and discover new 
treatments and a cure. Much of this 
work is being led by researchers at Vir-
ginia Commonwealth University (VCU) 
and supported by Virginia advocates. 
The Resolution calls for the advance-
ment 
of 
scientific 
and 
medical 
myotonic dystrophy research at the 
National Institutes of Health and as 
part of the Peer Reviewed Medical Re-
search Program of the Department of 
Defense; fostering biopharmaceutical 
innovation that will lead to treatments 
approved by the FDA and eventually a 
cure for myotonic dystrophy; advanc-
ing programs and policies that assist 
individuals with disabilities caused by 
myotonic dystrophy and the caregivers 
of those individuals; and encouraging 
awareness and education of myotonic 
dystrophy among patients, caregivers, 
clinicians, and researchers. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to see the Resolution desig-
nating September 15th as International 
Myotonic Dystrophy Awareness Day as 
an opportunity to raise awareness for 
this devastating disease and to pro-
mote and advance the health, well- 
being, and inherent dignity of all chil-
dren and adults with myotonic dys-
trophy. I ask for their support.

SENATE RESOLUTION 337—RECOG-
NIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE EXPLOSION AT THE PORT 
OF BEIRUT ON AUGUST 4, 2020, 
AND 
EXPRESSING 
SOLIDARITY 
WITH THE LEBANESE PEOPLE 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Mr. 
RUBIO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 337 
Whereas, on August 4, 2020, an estimated 
2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated at 
the Port of Beirut, killing more than 200 peo-
ple, injuring more than 7,500, displacing an 
estimated 300,000, and causing an estimated 
$4,600,000,000 in property damage; 
Whereas reports suggest that the ammo-
nium nitrate that detonated in the blast had 
been confiscated from the MV Rhosus, an 
abandoned cargo ship, in 2014 and had been 
unsafely stored at the Port of Beirut despite 
warnings of the risks posed by the stockpile 
from multiple customs and security officials 
in successive governments; 
Whereas, in addition to the 300,000 esti-
mated to be displaced by the blast, Lebanon 
also hosts 1,500,000 refugees from conflicts in 
Syria, Iraq, and the Palestinian Territories; 
Whereas, the United Nations estimates 
that 3,200,000 Lebanese nationals and refu-
gees are in need in Lebanon, including 
3,000,000 people in need of health assistance 
and 2,300,000 people in need of food and agri-
cultural assistance; 
Whereas the people of Lebanon face what 
the World Bank has described as a ‘‘delib-
erate depression’’ and an economic crisis 
compounded by the explosion at the Port of 
Beirut and impasse of governance; 
Whereas the World Bank projects that 
more than half of the population of Lebanon 
lives in poverty in 2021 and 25 percent lives 
in extreme poverty; 
Whereas the World Bank estimates that in-
flation increased from 10 percent in January 
2020 to 120 percent in August 2020 while, ac-
cording to the Central Administration of 
Statistics for Lebanon, food prices rose 402 
percent between December 2019 and Decem-
ber 2020; 
Whereas, 3 days after the explosion on Au-
gust 4, 2020, the United States Agency for 
International Development activated a Dis-
aster Assistance Response Team (‘‘DART’’) 
and stood up a Response Management Team 
(‘‘RMT’’) to coordinate the response of the 
United States Government, which included— 
(1) $15,100,000 to support emergency food 
and health response activities; 
(2) $10,500,000 to the World Food Program 
(‘‘WFP’’) in order to reach 300,000 people af-
fected by the explosions; 
(3) coordination at an international donors 
conference, raising an additional $298,000,000 
in assistance; 
(4) an airlift of emergency health kits con-
taining critical medical commodities suffi-
cient to support up to 60,000 people for 3 
months; and 
(5) supporting the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (‘‘UNHCR’’) to 
provide primary and secondary health care 
services to vulnerable individuals, including 
in response to the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, 1 year after the explosion, domes-
tic Lebanese investigations into the blast 
have been stalled and no answers have been 
provided to the Lebanese public; 
Whereas, on August 10, 2020, the Lebanese 
government referred the Beirut explosion to

August 4, 2021 
the Judicial Council for investigation and, 
on August 13, 2020, Judge Fadi Sawan was ap-
pointed to head the investigation and pos-
sible prosecution; 
Whereas Judge Sawan charged several gov-
ernment officials with criminal negligence 
for ignoring warnings regarding unsafe con-
ditions created by the storage of chemicals 
at the Port of Beirut; 
Whereas those officials accused of neg-
ligence in the Port blast have claimed immu-
nity from prosecution and filed legal efforts 
to remove Judge Sawan from the probe; 
Whereas, on February 18, 2021, Judge 
Sawan was removed from the investigation, 
further delaying justice for the victims of 
the blast and the people of Lebanon; 
Whereas Hezbollah, designated by the De-
partment of State as a foreign terrorist orga-
nization, benefits from governmental corrup-
tion at the Port of Beirut that allows for the 
illicit import and export of goods; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2021, the European 
Union, with the support of the Department 
of State and the Department of the Treas-
ury, adopted a sanctions regime targeting 
corrupt actors within the government of 
Lebanon; and 
Whereas the people of Lebanon across the 
political and sectoral spectrum have de-
manded accountability for the tragic events 
of August 4, 2020, and have requested that 
their governing and economic institutions 
implement 
meaningful 
reform, 
account-
ability, and transparency; Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) stands with the people of Lebanon 1 
year on from the horrific tragedy of the Port 
of Beirut explosion and acknowledges the 
burdens that the Lebanese people have 
shouldered; 
(2) supports the demands of the people of 
Lebanon for transparency, accountability, 
and an end to systemic and endemic corrup-
tion in the Government of Lebanon; 
(3) further supports continued efforts by 
the United States Government to provide hu-
manitarian relief in concert with other gov-
ernments and international partners in a 
manner that directly benefits the Lebanese 
people and is through properly-vetted chan-
nels, organizations, and individuals; 
(4) commends the European Union for de-
veloping, with the support of the United 
States, the framework of sanctions regime to 
prompt accountability and good governance 
in Lebanon; 
(5) calls on all Lebanese officials to respect 
and abide by an independent and transparent 
judiciary investigation into the cause of, and 
responsibility for, the port explosion; and 
(6) further calls on Lebanese political lead-
ers to form and approve a stable, democratic, 
and legitimate government and to imme-
diately implement the reforms necessary to 
ensure good governance and economic sta-
bility.

‘‘CHANCE in TECH Act’’. 
SEC. lllll2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) During any given 90-day period there 
can be more than 500,000 information tech-
nology job openings in the United States. 
(2) Employment in the technology sector is 
growing twice as fast as employment in the 
United States. 
(3) Jobs in the technology sector tend to 
provide higher pay and better benefits than 
other jobs and have been more resilient to 
economic downturn than jobs available in 
other private sector industries. 
(4) 
Information 
technology 
skills 
are 
transferrable across nearly all industries. 
(5) Exceptional education and on-the-job 
training programs exist and should be scaled 
to meet the demands of the modern tech-
nology workforce. 
(6) Adoption of existing employer-driven 
intermediary 
models, 
such 
as 
ApprenticeshipUSA under the Department of 
Labor, will help grow the information tech-
nology workforce. 
(7) Career pathway education should start 
in high school through pathways and pro-
grams of study that align with local and re-
gional employer needs. 
(8) Preparing a student for a job in the 
technology sector is essential to the growth 
and competitiveness of the economy in the 
United States in the 21st Century. 
(9) Nearly 800,000 information technology 
workers will retire between 2017 and 2024. 
(10) According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, in May 2020, the median annual wage

f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank the majority leader for allowing 
me to say a few words tonight, and I 
want to commend him and the Repub-
lican Leader, MITCH MCCONNELL, for al-
lowing us to have this series of amend-
ments. 
The Senate has worked its will and 
will continue to work its will tomor-
row. As was said, there have been 22 
amendments on the floor. About half of 
them are Democratic amendments, and 
about half of them are Republican 
amendments. 
I will say, also, there has just been a 
lot of discussion that has ensued be-
cause of this amendment process. So a 
lot of people have had the opportunity 
to discuss their issues to try to im-
prove the bill in certain ways, and, 
frankly, a lot of these amendments 
were accepted; they were voted on posi-
tively—well, one just recently with re-
gard to a safety issue that was just dis-
cussed—and improve the bill. So that is 
the way this place ought to work, and 
I think it is consistent with what we 
tried to do in this process from the be-
ginning, where we saw an opportunity 
to pull out core infrastructure from a 
much larger package and deal with it 
without raising taxes but by focusing 
on bipartisan solutions, and that is ex-
actly what the underlying bill does. 
The next step in that, then, was to 
say: Let’s try to have an open amend-
ment process too. And sure enough, we 
have. 
I had some colleagues of mine come 
up to me tonight and say: You know, it 
is nice to see the Senate working its 
will again, because these are colleagues 
who were around in previous decades 
where, you know, they saw this more 
often. 
So, again, I want to thank my col-
leagues for going through this process. 
It requires some patience. It requires 
some consensus. Some amendments 
had to be altered in some ways to be 
sure that both sides were comfortable 
having votes on them. But at the end 
of the day, we are able to say that peo-
ple’s voices are being heard. 
This will continue tomorrow. I just 
saw a list of about 10 amendments, and 
I know there are others as well that 
people would like to offer tomorrow, 
and I am all for it, as is Senator 
SINEMA. Senator SINEMA and I are very 
pleased that Members have the oppor-
tunity to express themselves. 
I also want to talk a little about 
what this bill does and why it is so im-
portant for our country. 
For the past 2 days, we have been 
working through this amendment proc-
ess, and sometimes we lose sight of the 
bigger picture here. The bigger picture 
is that we as a country have an infra-
structure system that is badly in need 
of repair. We are consistently rated as 
a country with an infrastructure sys-
tem that, frankly, hasn’t kept up with 
the rest of the world. 
There is a group called the World 
Economic Forum, and they give a re-
port card every couple years, and 
America ends up, you know, 13th or 
14th in the world in terms of infra-
structure. That is not where we want 
to be. 
By the way, on a broader gauge of 
competitiveness, we are right up at the 
top in terms of our trade system, our 
tax system, our economic system gen-
erally, but with regard to infrastruc-
ture, we are not. 
As some of you have heard me say be-
fore, this is about competitiveness too. 
Think about this: China spends three 
or four times more as a percentage of 
their GDP than we do on infrastruc-
ture. The reality, as I have looked at 
those numbers, is that it is even higher 
than that, but let’s say three or four 
times higher. Why? Because they get 
it. They are trying to outcompete us in 
every way, including having better 
ports, better rail, better airports, and 
the ability to both buy and sell their 
products overseas, and we here in 
America want to be at the top of that 
list. That is why it is very important, 
from my point of view, that we focus 
on the economic impact here. 
If we get this bill passed, it will make 
our economy more efficient; therefore, 
more productive; therefore, the econ-
omy will grow; therefore, more tax rev-
enue will come into the coffers. 
There has been a lot of discussion 
about the pay-fors in this legislation. 
We will know more as the CBO report 
tells us very specifically how it is paid 
for. But the bottom line is, much of 
what happens in this bill, which is 
spending for capital assets, this long- 
term spending—it is not going to be 
spent next year. It may be spent in 5 
years or 10 years. It may be a bridge in 
Georgia. It may be a port in Alabama. 
Those take years and years and years. 
The funding we are providing, the $550 
billion in this bill, will be spent over 
that period of time. It will add to those 
hard assets. It is, as a result of that, on 
the supply side of the economy, cre-
ating jobs, creating hard assets, like 
the bridges and like the ports, and as a 
result of that, it is actually counter-
inflationary. 
I know there has been concern on the 
floor, including raised today in one of 
the amendments, about the fact that 
more spending leads to more inflation. 
Not this kind of spending. The kind of 
spending that would lead to it is more 
what is called the demand side of the 
equation—you know, as an example, 
the stimulus checks or even the unem-
ployment insurance benefits. That led 
to more demand in the economy. Yes, 
that did drive up our inflation over the 
past several months and continues to. 
This is not that. This is spending over 
the long haul. It will create these cap-
ital assets that will make our economy 
more efficient and should be counter-
inflationary. 
We have a number of economists who 
have spoken to this: Doug Holtz-Eakin 
some of you know; also Michael Strain, 
who is at the American Enterprise In-
stitute. The Penn Wharton study on 
this is very interesting. They say, ac-
tually, that our legislation, as they 
analyze it, will end up growing the

economy, creating more jobs, and actu-
ally reducing the deficit, meaning 
more money will come into the coffers 
than we are spending here that is not 
paid for with CBO-certified official 
scores because of the economic impact 
of this. 
So this is very important for all of 
our constituents. It is also important 
for our broader economy, to make sure 
America stays at the forefront and 
that we can be competitive for our kids 
and our grandkids. 
Let’s take the State of Ohio as an ex-
ample since I happen to be from Ohio 
and why it is going to help my State. 
Ohio is a big infrastructure State. We 
have a lot of roads and a lot of bridges. 
Ohio’s roadway network has a lot of 
congestion also. It is estimated that 
the congestion in Ohio costs motorists 
an estimated $4.7 billion each year in 
lost time and wasted fuel. That is ac-
cording to the American Society of 
Civil Engineers, which scored Ohio’s 
roads at a D in their 2021 infrastructure 
report card—a D. Now, the Nation as a 
whole is only a C-minus under their 
analysis. Ohio is a D. So we are a little 
worse than the Nation as a whole. As a 
whole, again, we are falling behind but 
Ohio particularly. 
We are second in the Nation for the 
number of bridges. We have got a lot of 
little rivers and railroad tracks in 
Ohio, so we have got a lot of bridges. 
We have 44,736 bridges in Ohio. 
By the way, they have looked at 
these bridges. Their analysis is that 
nearly half of them are not in good 
condition. 
Our farmers, who are working to 
plant crops in their fields, want to be 
able to then get those crops to market. 
They want to get them to the ele-
vators. They want to be able to export 
them. They care about infrastructure. 
The moms and dads across Ohio who 
commute to work every day would 
heck of a lot rather spend their time 
with their kids than sitting in a car in 
a traffic jam on, you know, I–71 or 75 or 
I–270 or I–70. 
We have got a lot of great roads in 
Ohio, but, frankly, they can’t keep up 
with the demand, so we have got a lot 
of traffic jams during rushing hour. 
Those are some of the people who care 
a lot about infrastructure. 
Our manufacturers in Ohio—we make 
everything in Ohio. We make cars. We 
make washing machines. We make 
tanks. We are proud of what we make 
in Ohio and what we export all around 
the world. We have got to be sure to 
get those products to market, too, so 
infrastructure is really important. 
Today, I talked to a company in Ohio 
that has trucks all over Ohio and the 
country, for that matter. It is the 
Cintas Corporation. They are the uni-
form company, but they do a lot more 
than uniforms. They are excited about 
this bill because it is going to help 
them be more efficient in their deliv-
ery of their services. 
That is the same with our truckers. I 
talked to a trucking company person 
yesterday who was interested in how 
this would affect the truckstops and 
wanted to know about, you know, elec-
tric vehicle charging stations and so 
on. But the bottom line was, this per-
son said this is going to help because 
our truckers want to have a safe road 
and a safe bridge. They want to be able 
to meet their requirements and not get 
stuck in traffic jams and be able to 
make more money on the road, frank-
ly. 
So this is something that helps our 
constituents across the board. But it 
goes well beyond just our roads. This is 
also about water infrastructure in this 
legislation. Communities across our 
State deserve water infrastructure that 
is going to deliver them clean, safe 
drinking water. We have got a lot of 
old water systems in Ohio that need 
help and need it badly. 
We also have a lot of wastewater sys-
tems in Ohio that are in trouble. Some 
of you may know this, but there are 
new EPA rules that have come out over 
the past couple decades about waste-
water systems and particularly com-
bined sewer overflow systems, where 
when you have a lot of rain, in many of 
our systems in Ohio, there is a com-
bination of the sewer system and the 
wastewater system, and that is not 
safe. Yet fixing it is really expensive. 
Those communities—mostly midsize 
cities in Ohio but some larger cities as 
well—have all said to me: Can you help 
us a little more on water infrastruc-
ture? 
With the revolving loan program we 
have in here, the ability for them to 
get low-interest Federal loans to be 
able to expand their water infrastruc-
ture system—they will be able to do 
that in this legislation, as well as re-
ceive grants from the Federal Govern-
ment to help them ensure that we do 
have water systems that work. 
Folks in rural parts of our State— 
Ohio is an Appalachian State. We have 
about 32 counties considered part of 
Appalachia. And guess what. In most of 
those counties, we have virtually no 
internet. I mean, sometimes there is 
real slow internet you can get but vir-
tually no internet. This is why, for 
some of our kids in those counties in 
Ohio—these are rural counties that 
don’t have access to Wi-Fi of a speed 
that is appropriate for school, much 
less work. 
These kids are falling behind, and 
particularly, of course, during the pan-
demic, when they had to rely on online 
learning. And the stories are out there, 
and you know them, and the mom that 
comes up to me when I am out and 
about in Ohio and says: You know 
what; I had to take my kid to the park-
ing lot of the library, which is a 45- 
minute drive for me across rural Ohio 
roads, to be able to do her homework. 
That makes no sense. We want the 
digital divide to be closed. We want the 
ability for those kids in rural Ohio to 
have access to the internet, just as 
kids can get access to it in suburban or 
more urban settings. But even in the 
suburban and urban settings, we want 
to help be sure those kids have the 
hookup to their home to get that inter-
net and to be able to afford that inter-
net. 
So this legislation is unprecedented 
in many ways in terms of infrastruc-
ture—more roads, more bridges, more 
ports, more water systems—but it is 
also historic, unprecedented in terms 
of the expansion of broadband, finally. 
Again, this is about catching up. 
There are countries around the world 
that actually have better broadband 
than we do that are not even developed 
countries. They are poorer countries. 
You would think they might be a little 
behind, but they are sort of leap-
frogging us in terms of technology be-
cause they realize how important hav-
ing that internet build-out is. 
The other issue is for telehealth. 
There are more and more people rely-
ing on telehealth. Part of this comes 
out of the pandemic, when people kind 
of had to do that. They didn’t want to 
go into a doctor’s office or hospital for 
fear of the COVID pandemic. And, 
frankly, right now with the variants— 
and the delta variant in particular— 
there are some people who are still 
now, unfortunately, not comfortable 
going into a healthcare setting, but 
they need to have an appointment. 
They need to have someone to check 
them out, and they need, perhaps, with 
regard to behavioral health, to have 
the ability to have a consult. They can 
do that online now, and the Federal 
government has been reimbursing that 
for the first time, because before, under 
Medicare and Medicaid, that was very 
difficult. So this is going to be a part of 
our system. It is a good thing, sort of 
a rare silver lining in a terrible dark 
cloud of the pandemic that we learned 
how to use telehealth better. 
So what if you don’t have access to 
internet? So what if you are a veteran 
in southeast Ohio and you have to 
drive 21⁄2 hours to a VA clinic, and in-
stead you would like to do telehealth 
because it makes a lot more sense for 
your situation, particularly during the 
pandemic, but you don’t have internet? 
So, definitely, that is not fair. So tele-
health is another reason for us to ex-
pand internet access. 
Finally, just for our economic benefit 
in these communities, we want more 
startups. We want more companies to 
be able to be successful. Without the 
internet—let’s face it—it is going to be 
very, very difficult. These are all part 
of this legislation as well. 
The hard core infrastructure you 
think of—like roads and bridges, yes; 
water infrastructure, yes; ports, rail, 
freight—but also the digital infrastruc-
ture that ties our country together— 
that is part of this legislation as well. 
Again, it is why economists who look 
at this say this is actually going to 
help make our economy work better, 
make it more efficient. We will be 
more productive as a country, and we 
will have more economic growth and 
then more revenue will come in. That 
is why this is so popular.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5886 
August 4, 2021 
I mean, when you think about it, 
what can everybody agree on in Amer-
ica today? Not much. We are a country 
that is more divided, and that saddens 
me. It concerns me, particularly as we 
face challenges, some of which, like the 
pandemic, are here domestically, and 
some of which are global challenges 
brought on by some of our adversaries, 
like Russia or China or North Korea or 
Iran. But we are divided as a country. 
One thing that brings us together is 
our military. I think most people ac-
knowledge and respect the role that 
our military plays. And another is in-
frastructure. It is an issue where tradi-
tionally Republicans and Democrats 
were able to come together and say: We 
may disagree on taxes and healthcare 
and all sorts of other things, but on 
this issue of strong infrastructure, we 
can come together. 
Again, I think it makes sense eco-
nomically, and, also, it is popular. Peo-
ple know when they are driving over 
potholes or getting stuck in traffic 
jams or not being able to get a product 
because the ports are backed up, which 
they are right now. Our ports are inef-
ficient and people literally can’t get 
products. They can’t get cars or they 
can’t get an electronic device. That is 
all part of this. So this is something 
that ought to bring us together, and it 
does bring us together. 
The polling out there shows this, by 
the way. There are two polls in the last 
few months that both said that 87 per-
cent of the American people want us to 
work on this infrastructure project on 
a bipartisan process and get it done. 
Those numbers were unbelievable, and 
it was exactly 87 percent in both polls, 
interestingly, even though one was 
CBS and one was CNBC. 
But forget the polls for a minute and 
just go home and talk to people. They 
do want to make sure that we are not 
raising taxes to do this. They don’t 
want to see us helping the economy 
long-term 
with 
infrastructure 
but 
hurting the economy short-term with 
higher taxes. And I agree. And we don’t 
do that here. That is what is particu-
larly great about this approach. It is 
that we said that we are going to pull 
out core infrastructure only and we are 
not going to raise taxes. 
So we have the funds in here to be 
able to help with regard to our high-
ways, our bridges, our ports, our water-
ways, our broadband expansion. But we 
also have the ability for us to do that 
in a way that makes sense for all 
Americans. 
In Ohio, it is going to help us do 
something else that is important, and 
that is to help with regard to some of 
our big infrastructure projects. I will 
talk about one tonight briefly—the 
Brent Spence Bridge. This is in my 
hometown of Cincinnati, OH. It is a 
critical bridge because it is where I–75 
and I–71 come together, and therefore 
it is a bottleneck. Twice as many cars 
drive on that bridge every day as it was 
built for. Twice as many cars drive on 
that bridge every day—and trucks—as 
it was built for. It is the reason that 
there is a traffic jam there during rush 
hour. But it is also the reason that it is 
unsafe, because over time the shoulders 
have been removed to create another 
lane. So if there is an accident on that 
bridge, there is nowhere to go. We had 
an accident 2 months ago with two 
trucks that collided, and we had to 
close it down, actually, for several 
weeks, and it was a mess. 
And talk about the effect on the 
economy. Think about this. There are 
roughly 3 million people in the metro-
politan area there, with Dayton and 
Cincinnati on one side, and the other 
side has about 1 million people in Cov-
ington, KY. And you have traffic going 
all the way north and south from Can-
ada to Mexico, and all of a sudden you 
don’t have a bridge available because 
of the safety concerns that led to the 
accident. So we need a solution with 
regard to that bridge, and we have been 
talking about it for years. For 25 years, 
I have been involved in the effort to try 
to find the funding to replace this 
bridge because it needs it. Finally, we 
will have the ability to do that. We will 
have the ability to help, with Ken-
tucky and with Ohio and with the Fed-
eral 
Government 
working 
together 
with the local community, to complete 
this Brent Spence Bridge corridor 
project. Why? Because we are putting 
an unprecedented amount of money 
into not just bridges but bridges like 
this one—bridges that are major com-
mercial bridges; bridges that are func-
tionally obsolete, which ours have been 
for years; bridges that desperately need 
the help. 
We also have a big aviation industry 
in Ohio. We support a lot of jobs 
through aviation, our second biggest 
industry after agriculture in Ohio. 
There is $25 billion for new spending for 
airports in here. That is going to help 
airports build on the momentum that 
we need right now in Ohio to be able to 
expand our aerospace industry. 
On the shores of Lake Erie, on the 
north coast of Ohio, we will also have 
help. Lake Erie supports fishing and 
tourism industries that total over $10 
billion. It provides drinking water for 
10 million people. 
It is the top tourist attraction in our 
State, but as anyone who visits the 
lake will tell you, they have some seri-
ous long-term health challenges with 
the lake. We have invasive species. We 
have 
a 
problem 
with 
toxic 
algal 
blooms. We have pollution. We have 
rising levels of the lake. This bill helps 
with regard to all of that. With regard 
to rising levels of the lake, there are 
communities on the lake that will tell 
you their water systems don’t work be-
cause the lake water has risen to the 
point where the outtake valve which is 
next to the intake valve is now actu-
ally underwater, so the system doesn’t 
work well. In fact, the system is in-
credibly expensive to replace. So this 
will help with regard to that. 
As cochair of the Senate Great Lakes 
Caucus, I am very pleased to see this 
investment because it will support the 
infrastructure and infrastructure in-
vestments in communities all along 
Lake Erie and every one of our Great 
Lakes. 
Finally and crucially, the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act before us 
helps more than 300,000 Ohio house-
holds that lack access to this high- 
speed internet. That is incredibly im-
portant. Our legislation does every-
thing that I have talked about in terms 
of infrastructure, and that is impor-
tant. 
Again, we have the studies out there 
that I talked about, including one from 
Penn, from the University of Pennsyl-
vania Wharton School. They talked 
about how the economic growth from 
this study will actually make our econ-
omy better and create more jobs, and 
they say that, actually, over time, it 
reduces the deficit, based on looking at 
our study and, specifically, our pro-
posals. So all that is true. 
The final thing I guess I want to say 
is that it goes beyond infrastructure. It 
goes to how to get Washington back to 
a point where Washington is solving 
problems for the American people. And 
this bill is not perfect for anybody—no 
Republican, no Democrat. Why? It is a 
bipartisan compromise. 
You know, again, we started off with 
a product that President Biden intro-
duced that was $2.65 trillion—a huge 
package called ‘‘infrastructure,’’ but 
most of it was not for infrastructure. It 
had huge tax increases in it—the high-
est tax increase, it would have been, in 
American history. It would have made 
our country less competitive, in my 
view. 
We said: OK, let’s find a group of 
Democrats and Republicans, and let’s 
agree to pull out the core parts of this, 
the core infrastructure, and find a way 
to pay for it without raising taxes. 
That is what we did, and we worked 
hard to create a product that was fair 
for everybody. But that means finding 
that consensus, and that is not easy. 
You know, we all had to make con-
cessions, but, at the end of the day, we 
got a product—$550 billion over the 
next 5 years, which will be spread out, 
spent over many, many years, that will 
put America back on top in terms of 
infrastructure. 
It will put us in a position where, for 
our kids and our grandkids, they are 
going to have a more productive and a 
more efficient economy—one that pro-
duces more, one that has the ability for 
America to say to the world: Look at 
us again. We are back. We are back. We 
now have an infrastructure system 
with our ports and our roads and our 
bridges, with our water infrastructure, 
and with our broadband that can be, 
once again, a model for the rest of the 
world and help move us forward and en-
sure that every American has the op-
portunity to succeed. 
So this bipartisan process in and of 
itself, I think, is an accomplishment of 
this legislation. The underlying bill is 
what is most important, I suppose, but
