August 30, 2022 
REMEMBERING JOSEPH RYAN 
FERRALL 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Joseph Ryan Ferrall, who 
passed on August 19, 2022, at the age of 34. 
Joseph was born on August 13, 1988, in Al-
liance, Ohio. The son of Nicholas and Anna 
Marsico, he would become a graduate of 
Marlington High School’s 2006 class. After 
achieving this, Joseph would become a fur-
nace attendant for Timken Steel. 
Joseph was the definition of a true family 
man. He was the husband of Amber Ferrall, 
whom he proclaimed was the love of his life 
at eight years old and married on January 22, 
2015. They would raise three handsome boys: 
Tucker, Colton, and Jaxon. Alongside that, Jo-
seph was a lover of fishing, golf, and baseball; 
the latter of which he passed along to his sons 
by coaching their teams. 
Unfortunately, Joseph was one of three em-
ployees injured by the furnace explosion at the 
Timken Steel plant on July 26, 2022. While he 
fought valiantly, Joseph eventually succumbed 
to his wounds. Joseph leaves behind his wife 
and his three sons; his parents, Rhonda and 
Eric; his brothers Tony (Kaitlyn) Ferrall, and 
Scott Ferrall; his sister, Erica Ferrall; his 
grandparents, Robert and Carol Swonger; his 
in-laws, Wendy and Tim Saunders; sisters-in- 
law, Melissa and Erin Saunders; brothers-in- 
law, Tim Saunders and Jon Fracchione; and 
many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, and 
nephews, and his best friend, Justin King. 
Joseph’s passing is one that should right-
fully affect us. This should not have happened. 
While we await the results from the investiga-
tion on what caused the explosion, let us 
make a commitment, as a community and as 
a nation, to do what is necessary to prevent 
incidents like this from reoccurring. Let us sur-
round his wife and kids with love and prayer. 
Joseph’s life was one that should have never 
been lost, but let’s make sure his passing is 
not in vain.

RECOGNIZING DANIEL REESE 
GRIME, USMC 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. 
Daniel Reese Grime. Mr. Grime was born on 
March 31, 1930, and graduated high school in 
Monaca, Pennsylvania, where he lettered in 
football and worked at the St. Joe Minerals 
Corporation steel mill. 
Mr. Grime enlisted in the Marine Corps in 
1952, where he went through basic training at 
Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and 
completed the Sea School course at Norfolk 
Naval Base in Portsmouth, VA. It was at Nor-
folk Naval Base where Mr. Grime prepared for 
his duty aboard the USS New Jersey. He was 
soon promoted to Corporal and given the task 
to man the 16″ and 5″ guns aboard the pres-
tigious battleship BB–62. While aboard the 
USS New Jersey, Mr. Grime was a part of one 
of the most famous battleships involved in the 
Korean War. The USS New Jersey took part 
in numerous engagements providing Naval 
gunfire support, which played a crucial role in 
disrupting enemy supply lines. 
Mr. Grime would spend a total of six years 
in the Marines, including several years in the 
Marine Corps Reserves. Mr. Grime would go 
on to marry his loving wife, Janet, who he met 
while on leave in Washington, D.C. Together 
they raised four children. Mr. Grime would 
eventually return to work at the St. Joe Min-
erals Corporation steel mill and served as a 
volunteer fireman and as a volunteer at his 
local school system. He passed away on June 
3, 2022, as a proud Marine and proud citizen 
of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in re-
membering the life and memory of Mr. Daniel 
Reese Grime and all he has done for our be-
loved country.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF IRVIN ADAIR, JR. 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Irvin Adair’s 100th birthday. 
Mr. Adair is a dedicated father, grandfather, 
WWII veteran, and former public servant for 
the City of Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
On September 3, 1922, Irvin was born in a 
small farmhouse near El Dorado, Kansas. Mr. 
Adair has lived a full life dedicated to his 
country and family. Irwin had seven siblings, 
four younger brothers and three sisters. 
When World War II began, Irvin was only 
sixteen years old, but when he was old 
enough to enlist, he did so. He was sworn into 
the United States Navy on December 7, 1942, 
on the USS Oregon in Portland, Oregon—one 
year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Har-
bor. Irvin served on two destroyers during his 
service—the USS Frankford and the USS 
Uhlmann. The USS Frankford escorted supply 
ships from the Brooklyn Navy Yard to Casa 
Blanca, Africa. 
Seaman 1st Class Adair proudly served on 
the USS Uhlmann, a ship with extensive com-
bat engagement during WWII. Irvin and his fel-
low sailors provided aircraft carrier support for 
air strikes in many Pacific Theater battles, in-
cluding the Battle of Iwo Jima. In addition, 
they participated in the Okinawa, Leyte Gulf, 
Western Carolines, Lueon, and Japan oper-
ations. When WWII ended, the USS Uhlmann 
docked at Tokyo Bay, Japan, next to the USS 
Missouri, where the Empire of Japan signed 
the official Instrument of Surrender to the Al-
lied forces. Irvin could see the military dig-
nitaries on the bow of the USS Missouri from 
where he stood on the USS Uhlmann. 
For his steadfast dedication and service, 
Irvin received the European African Middle 
Eastern Campaign Medal, the American Cam-
paign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, 
the Philippine Liberation Medal with two stars, 
and the Asiatic Pacific Area Campaign Medal 
with six stars. Irvin’s combat experience can 
only be described in volumes as he bravely 
fought in most of the WWII Pacific Theater 
Sea battles. 
After being Honorably Discharged from the 
US Navy, civilian life began for Irvin. In 1948, 
he started working for the City of Colorado 
Springs as the Supervisor of the Peterson Air-
port Service Facility. During this time, he was 
lucky to meet and marry Ms. Barbara Camp-
bell in September 1952. Barbara was a won-
derful wife (of 66 years), mother, and grand-
mother until her passing in January 2017. To-
gether, they have three children: Cathy, David, 
and Judy. Their legacy continues with six 
grandchildren. Irvin retired in 1980 after 32 
years of dedicated service to the City of Colo-
rado Springs. 
Today, Irvin continues to enjoy life in Colo-
rado Springs, Colorado. His life may seem 
simple, but that is undoubtedly the Lord’s gift 
for his heroism and the sacrifices he made 
during his service in WWII. 
Mr. Adair remains connected with fellow 
service members as he is a lifetime member 
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the 
American Legion. 
I wish Mr. Adair a very happy 100th birthday 
and thank him for his service to our great Na-
tion. May he celebrate many more.

RECOGNIZING THE BLACK STUNT-
MEN 
AND 
WOMEN’S 
ASSOCIA-
TION 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, l rise to take 
note of the history and accomplishments of 
the Black Stuntmen and Women’s Association 
(BSA). For 55 years, their pioneering efforts 
paved the way for all minority stuntmen and 
women to contribute their talents to the Amer-
ican entertainment industry. They have helped 
assure that television, movies, and other 
media, which have a global reach, truly reflect 
our nation. 
Founded in 1967 by Eddie Smith with co- 
founder Alex Brown and the group’s first presi-
dent Ernie Robinson, members would meet 
after their regular jobs in a park in Compton, 
California, to train and perfect their stunts for 
Hollywood. At the time, Caucasian stunt dou-
bles in dark makeup nearly always stood in for 
Black actors during filming. By organizing to-
gether and working with Black actors who 
wanted more realistic stunt doubles, they ef-
fectively pressured producers and directors to 
change their practices and open the doors to 
their work. 
These were hard-fought battles. BSA filed 
32 lawsuits to shed light on systematic dis-
crimination in the film industry. With the help 
of the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission and attorney Margaret Ryan Kreeger, 
BSA won all 32 cases, including a 1976 judg-
ment that ordered major studios to abide by 
federal mandates against discriminatory hiring, 
a major victory in an industry that saw itself 
outside such legal mandates. BSA’s efforts 
ended the common practice of ‘‘paint down’’ to 
match a double to the actor’s skin tone, while 
they also broadened and changed the land-
scape of the film industry. 
Forcing more equitable studio hiring prac-
tices not only cracked open the door for Black 
stunt doubles, but also increased Black and 
minority participation in many other roles be-
hind the camera, including cinematographers, 
set and lighting designers, costume and make- 
up designers, even directors and producers. 
BSA’s groundbreaking work deserves rec-
ognition, especially now that many early mem-
bers have retired or passed away. While much 
work remains to assure real equality of oppor-
tunity, I commend the BSA for their continuing 
fight for a Hollywood that reflects all of Amer-
ica.

RECOGNIZING MAYOR GRACE 
VARGAS 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my constituent the 
late Honorable Grace Vargas for her countless 
years of dedication to the Inland Empire as 
the former Mayor of Rialto. 
Grace served her community for nearly 35 
years and shined as a trailblazer for women of 
color throughout the Inland Empire. As a sin-
gle mother of seven children, Grace moved 
from Yuma, Arizona, to Fontana, California, in 
1959. She joined the California Employment 
Training Act (CETA) program, gaining new 
skills and turning towards a life of public serv-
ice for the City of Rialto. 
She began her career in 1979 with the City 
Clerk’s office, later transferring to clerk for the 
Rialto Police Department and the City Treas-
urer’s Office. She was elected to the City 
Council in 1998, where she served for two 
years. 
In 2000, Grace Vargas was elected Mayor, 
becoming the first woman and first Latina to 
hold that position. She served as Mayor for 12 
years, retiring in 2012. During her tenure, she 
accomplished several crucial economic devel-
opment projects, such as Renaissance Rialto 
and a new senior center. Her legacy would 
later be memorialized as the city established 
the center as the Grace Vargas Senior Center 
in 2016. 
Her work in Rialto and the Inland Empire 
uplifted residents and businesses, leaving an 
impact that will be felt for decades to come. 
Grace’s coworkers and friends gave her the 
nickname ‘‘Amazing Grace,’’ exemplifying her 
dedication and influence on the community. 
Grace Vargas will be missed in the Inland Em-
pire, but she will remain in our memory 
through her contributions to the community. 
Today, Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
recognize the Honorable Grace Vargas on the 
House floor for the contributions she has 
made to the greater community of the Inland 
Empire. May she rest in peace and her family 
find comfort during this time.

RECOGNIZING ILIR ZHERKA 
HON. JAMES A. HIMES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Ilir Zherka’s service as Executive 
Director of the Alliance for International Ex-
change. For nearly seven years, Ilir has de-
voted himself to advancing person-to-person 
exchanges 
and 
fostering 
greater 
global 
connectivity. During that time, the Alliance has 
forged deeper relationships between its mem-
bers and federal officials, and federal funding 
for educational and cultural exchange pro-
grams has reached record levels. 
Ilir’s tenure coincided with the COVID–19 
pandemic, which derailed countless exchange 
opportunities and threatened the short-term vi-
ability of any international linkages. Under Ilir’s 
steady hand, however, the Alliance helped ex-
pand on line programming and worked to ease 
barriers to participation. 
Ilir also recognizes the role that exchanges 
play in strengthening global democratic net-
works. I commend the Alliance’s work to pro-
mote freedom and American values within the 
international exchange community as a means 
for reversing the global decline of democracy. 
While the exchange community will feel his 
absence, Ilir’s legacy will endure through new 
and fortified international relationships. I join 
the Alliance in thanking Ilir for his years of 
steadfast service, and I wish him the best in 
his future endeavors.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL 
RETIREMENT 
THRIFT 
INVEST-
MENT BOARD INSPECTOR GEN-
ERAL ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Federal Retirement Thrift Invest-
ment Board Inspector General Act of 2022, 
which would create an independent Inspector 
General (IG) for the Federal Retirement Thrift 
Investment Board (FRTIB). The FRTIB admin-
isters the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), the retire-
ment savings and investment plan for federal 
employees. 
On June 1, 2022, FRTIB launched a new 
system with the goal of modernizing TSP’s 
recordkeeping, improving customer service 
and bolstering cybersecurity. There have been 
widespread problems with the new system, in-
cluding account access, account balances, 
missing or incomplete information in accounts 
and hours-long wait times to reach customer 
service. 
As of December 2021, TSP had approxi-
mately 
6.5 
million 
participants 
and 
$838,052,933,000 in assets, making it the 
world’s largest defined contribution plan. Fed-
eral employees dedicate their careers to serv-
ing our country, and they deserve a retirement 
savings and investment plan that provides top- 
tier customer support and security. 
While the Employee Benefits Security Ad-
ministration has the audit responsibility for the 
FRTIB, as it does for all private sector 401(k) 
plans, there is currently no IG for the FRTIB. 
The problems with the new TSP system are 
evidence enough that the FRTIB needs an 
independent IG.

CAMP FOR GIRLS 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100 Anniversary Reunion of 
Waukeela Camp for Girls, located in Eaton, 
New 
Hampshire. 
Established 
in 
1922, 
Waukeela Camp for Girls has been a home 
away from home for campers and staff alike 
for over 100 years. 
Waukeela has enshrined its sense of com-
munity with treasured traditions and open 
arms to all, which has built a life-long commu-
nity that endures even years after leaving 
camp. It is no easy feat to keep a small busi-
ness running for 100 years, and I congratulate 
Waukeela’s current and former owners and 
staff on this accomplishment. Waukeela is 
also remarkable for the ways in which they 
give back to our larger Mount Washington Val-
ley community, and we are grateful for their 
work.

On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-

tions once again to the entire Waukeela Camp

RECOGNIZING MS. MOLLY 
MCFADDEN 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the significant contributions 
of Ms. Molly McFadden, as she steps down as 
Director of the North Central Texas Council of 
Governments’ 
(NCTCOG) 
Department 
of 
Emergency Preparedness. I’m pleased to join 
Ms. McFadden’s friends and colleagues to cel-
ebrate her twenty years of committed service 
to the safety of North Texas. 
Ms. McFadden, a University of North Texas 
alumna, first began working for the NCTCOG 
in September 2002 as an Emergency Pre-
paredness Specialist. During her time as a 
student, her involvement in the International 
Emergency Management Student Association 
in the aftermath of 9/11 garnered numerous 
awards. She also briefly served on the munic-
ipal level as the Emergency Management 
Specialist for the town of Flower Mound in 
2003. In 2005, she also earned her Master of 
Public Administration at UNT and continues to 
be a devoted proponent of her beloved alma 
mater. 
Throughout 
her 
lengthy 
tenure 
with 
NCTCOG, Ms. McFadden’s passionate dedi-
cation to public preparedness and safety has 
expanded and strengthened North Texas’ 
emergency response capabilities and infra-
structure. Ms. McFadden was personally in-
strumental in forming the NCTCOG Emer-
gency Preparedness (EP) Department, which 
effectively coordinates and fosters collabora-
tion between local, county, regional, State, 
and Federal agencies to execute and heighten 
regional emergency preparedness and home-
land security programs. After being promoted 
to EP Supervisor and then EP Manager, Ms. 
McFadden was selected as the Director of the 
EP Department in 2010, where she has 
served for the past 12 years. 
In 
addition 
to 
her 
leadership 
at 
the 
NCTCOG, Ms. McFadden served on the 
Board of Directors for the Emergency Man-
agement Association of Texas (EMAT), and, 
from 2006–2008, as the organization’s Vice 
President. Her involvement with EMAT also in-
cluded significant contributions to educational 
programming for the Association’s annual con-
ference, which she capably chaired for several 
years. In addition, she is a member of the 
FBI’s InfraGard program, The International As-
sociation of Emergency Managers, and the 
World Affairs Council. 
Her emergency response deployments in-
clude Emergency Operation Center assign-
ments in the wakes of Hurricane Katrina, Hur-
ricane Harvey, and Hurricane Ike, where her 
selfless devotion helped to provide effective 
disaster relief to citizens and communities 
across Texas. On the local level, Ms. McFad-
den has implemented new training initiatives, 
such as Urban Shield and Big-X, to equip civil-
ians and government entities for emergency 
response. I am also personally grateful to her 
and her staff for their efforts to educate and 
equip my constituents to prepare for all haz-
ards, both natural and man made. At my an-
nual Emergency Preparedness Summit, she 
has often served as a subject matter expert on 
intergovernmental cooperation and as a panel 
moderator. 
Ms. McFadden’s expertise, diligence and 
leadership has resulted in the enhanced safety 
and well-being of her fellow Texans. I applaud 
her two decades of exemplary public service, 
and I wish her all the best in her future per-
sonal and professional endeavors.

HONORING THE HEROIC LIFE AND 
SERVICE OF HAROLD MCAFEE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heroic life and service of 
World War II veteran and United States Army 
Sergeant Harold McAfee. 
Harold McAfee was born in Detroit, Michi-
gan, on January 9th, 1923. Harold was a star 
hockey player in high school and was offered 
a scholarship to Fordham University. Instead, 
Harold enlisted in the newly formed 10th 
Mountain Division in 1943, where he trained in 
mountain combat and utilized his substantial 
hockey experience to learn skiing and moun-
taineering skills. He was deployed as a Com-
bat Infantry Squad leader in Italy and held the 
line against Tito’s movements on the Italy- 
Yugoslav border. 
During World War II, Harold played an inte-
gral role in one of the 10th Mountain Division’s 
most iconic attacks. After two other divisions 
had previously failed, the 10th Mountain Divi-
sion was tasked with securing Mount Bel-
vedere in Italy’s North Apennines to ensure Al-
lied forces could safely advance into northern 
Italy. The 10th Mountain Division valiantly 
overran the Germans, clearing them from the 
high ground and laying the groundwork for an 
Allied victory. In 1946, Harold was honorably 
discharged and was awarded a Bronze Star 
and two Oak Leaf Clusters. 
After his time in the military, Harold dedi-
cated more than thirty years of his life working 
for the United States Postal Service. In 1989, 
Harold and his wife Loraine relocated from 
Long Island to Queensbury. They spent a- 
large amount of their time enjoying the out-
doors through hiking, skiing, camping, and 
golf. Harold prioritized sharing his passion for 
winter sports with children. For many years, 
he volunteered as a coach for Adirondack 
Youth Hockey, where he mentored hundreds 
of children. In addition, he was a member of 
several clubs in his community such as the 
Lions Club and the High Flyers. Harold re-
mained active until he reached the age of 97, 
when his attention became fully devoted to 
caring for his wife who developed dementia. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I am 
honored to recognize the extraordinary life of 
Harold McAfee. It is my hope that his active 
spirit and community service will be carried on 
by those who knew and loved him.

HONORING DOROTHY LOUISE 
LEONARD 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dorothy (Dot) Louise Leonard 
of Stevensville, Maryland, on the occasion of 
her 90th birthday. Ms. Leonard has contrib-
uted enormous energy and talent over the 
years to the protection of our Nation’s coastal 
resources, particularly our shellfish and the in-
dustry they support. Not surprisingly—for 
Dot—she is still immersed in shellfish restora-
tion work as we speak. 
A public policy graduate of New York’s Syr-
acuse University, Dot Leonard’s local govern-
ment land use planning work soon drew her 
into coastal conservation matters following 
Congress’ adoption of the 1972 Coastal Zone 
Management Act. Dot took on the monumental 
task of creating an atlas of shellfish production 
areas around the Nation’s entire coastline for 
the purpose of protecting those areas. She 
proceeded to develop Best Management Prac-
tices for Shellfish Restoration, now used by 
State and local governments to set sanitary 
control standards for our Nation’s shellfish 
waters and industry. 
Dot was recruited by the State of Maryland 
to lead its Department of Fisheries where she 
worked with all her might to help her Chesa-
peake Bay ‘watermen’ protect and restore 
their oyster grounds and other fishery re-
sources. She worked with the State of Wash-
ington, as executive director of the non-profit 
Willapa Alliance, to improve shellfish culture in 
the southwest corner of that State. 
Dot has been a ‘mover and shaker’ in the 
international shellfish restoration scene, help-
ing to pull together the initial gathering of what 
has become the International Shellfish Res-
toration Conference, now in its 20th year. 
Some of her favorite international shellfish res-
toration gatherings are those that have taken 
place in Ireland, from where her grandparents 
immigrated to America more than a century 
ago. As Chair of the House Natural Resources 
Subcommittee on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife, 
I know Dot’s contributions to shellfish restora-
tion and coastal conservation are far-reaching. 
Madam Speaker, it is appropriate to recog-
nize Dot Leonard for her extraordinary com-
mitment to coastal conservation and shellfish 
restoration as she celebrates her 90th birthday 
in Ireland surrounded by many of the friends 
that she has won over the years from the 
U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Scot-
land and beyond. Please join me in express-
ing deep appreciation for her service and in

HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bowie High School’s Cen-
tennial Celebration. 
On September 7, 2022, Bowie High School 
will celebrate its 100-year anniversary. Bowie 
High School was founded in 1922 and is one 
of El Paso’s oldest schools. Situated within 
100 yards of the United States-Mexico border, 
Bowie High School encapsulates our city’s his-
tory of integrated cultures between El Paso 
and our sister city, Ciudad Juarez. 
Over the last century, this beloved El Paso 
institution has been central to the education of 
South side, mostly Mexican-American families 
who live at our Nation’s front door. The school 
and its students have seen many hardships, 
including persecution and racial discrimination, 
but Bowie High School has built a strong and 
resilient community that has always per-
severed. 
Today, it continues to stand as a high 
school powerhouse of spirit and pride that has 
produced decades of distinguished alumni 
who have transformed our borderland. I am 
grateful for the commitment of all the adminis-
trative staff and teachers to educate every stu-
dent who has attended this historic institution. 
I commend Bowie High School’s 100 years 
of loyalty, tradition, and service to generations 
of El Pasoans who call themselves proud 
Bowie Bears.

VOLUNTEER 
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK CO-
ORDINATOR, LARK CHADWICK 
HON. MATTHEW M. ROSENDALE, SR. 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Ms. Lark Chadwick, for her remark-
able contributions to her community as Coordi-
nator of the Disabled American Veterans Vol-
unteer Transportation Network in Thompson 
Falls, Sanders County, MT. 
With many veterans in her own family and 
an extensive background teaching in the arts, 
in 2008 Ms. Chadwick offered up her skills in 
art, planning, and computers to expand her 
Local Area DAV VTN’s operations, public rela-
tions, new logo, and driver handbook outline. 
In 2009, Ms. Chadwick took over the task of 
coordinating this chapter. As coordinator, she 
takes calls from veterans and books transports 
to their VA-approved medical appointments, 
calls volunteers to drive those transports, 
manages the vans, and reports monthly to the 
DAV Hospital Service Coordinator. 
Over the course of fourteen years, Ms. 
Chadwick has successfully coordinated ap-
proximately 4,200 rides for 240 veterans. 
While consistently managing a 12 person 
team, 
Ms. 
Chadwick 
has 
also 
willingly 
sefefeifabove and beyond by volunteering her 
time as a driver, and thus far has driven over 
approximately 30,000 miles to ensure that vet-
erans are receiving the care they require. 
I also want to recognize Ms. Chadwick’s 
tireless efforts to recruit more volunteer drivers 
to meet the needs of our veteran neighbors. 
Along with others in Sanders County, Ms. 
Chadwick helped establish Sanders County 
Veterans Transportation—a group dedicated 
to fundraising for the purchase and replace-
ment of DAV Vans serving Sanders County. 
Through successful fundraising efforts from 
Ms. Chadwick and local residents, the Sand-
ers County DAV van fleet now has three vans. 
Ms. Chadwick’s service to Montana doesn’t 
end with her DAV coordinating work. With a 
heart ready to protect the foundational con-
cepts of freedom and our Constitution, in 2009 
she also formed the Thompson Falls TEA 
Party, became involved with the Sanders 
County Republican Central Committee, and 
established the Montana Committee to Protect 
the Constitution. 
Ultimately, I want to commend and thank 
Ms. Chadwick for her selflessness and out-
standing service to our veterans in Thompson 
Falls, Sanders County, Montana.

NE NATIONAL GUARD 170TH 
GROUP PARTNERSHIP 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate the 20th anniversary of the formal 
partnership between the United States Air 
Force’s 55th Wing and the Nebraska Air Na-
tional Guard’s 170th Group at Offutt Air Force 
Base in Nebraska. The anniversary occurred 
on the 3rd of June this year and was the first 
of its kind as the oldest association between 
the Air National Guard and an Active Duty 
combat-coded Air Force Wing. 
The first unit member of the 170th Group 
was now-retired Air Force Air National Guard 
Major General Rick Evans who arrived at 
Offutt Air Force Base on June 3, 2002, to set 
up and command what was initially Detach-
ment 1 of the Nebraska Air National Guard. 
Later, the 170th Group was formed to expand 
the mission capabilities of Detachment 1 into 
two squadrons: the 238th Combat Training 
Squadron which provided combat aircrew 
training support for the 55th Wing, and the 
170th Operations Support Squadron which 
provided vital support to 55th Wing missions in 
the areas of weapons and tactics, intelligence, 
base operations, weather, and aviation re-
source management. 
The extraordinary 20-year partnership be-
tween the 170th Group and the 55th Wing has 
enabled and sustained combat and sensitive 
reconnaissance operations supporting the war 
on terror and other national missions around 
the globe. Today, the 170th Group is pre-
paring to expand its mission yet again with 
two additional squadrons that will expand its 
aircraft maintenance and intelligence support 
capabilities. 
I am truly honored as a former 55th Wing 
Commander to have witnessed firsthand the 
operational impacts of the 170th Group. These 
outstanding Airmen ensure the daily success 
of the 55th Wing’s demanding global mission 
and are recognized across the Air Force com-
munity for their leadership in forging a world- 
class Active Duty and Reserve component 
partnership. 
I salute the visionary leadership of those 
who designed the 170th Group over 20 years 
ago and all those who have served in its units 
to the present day. Congratulations on 20 
years of success and the many more to come.

RECOGNIZING AMY LUNSTRA 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Amy Lunstra, owner of Festive Cup 
Coffee and Gift Boutique in Highlands Ranch, 
Colorado, for creating an inclusive work envi-
ronment for individuals with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities (IDD). 
A 
former 
special 
needs 
teacher 
at 
ThunderRidge 
High 
School 
in 
Highlands 
Ranch, Amy recognized a space where our 
community fell short—in the lack of employ-
ment and community engagement opportuni-
ties for those with IDD outside of school. 
In July 2020, in the midst of a global pan-
demic, Amy purchased Festive Cup Coffee 
with the intention of providing a space for 
those with IDD to work. Her goal was to break 
down barriers, promote tolerance and accept-
ance, and prove that individuals with IDD 
could thrive in a work environment. In January 
2021, Amy began hiring workers with IDD at 
Festive Cup and fostered a unique partnership 
between employees with and without IDD. 
Amy has tackled stigmas about IDD workers 
and provided the chance for those with IDD to 
gain independence and self-sufficiency. It 
goes without saying that Amy has had an in-
credible impact, not only on those with IDD 
that she employs, but on our community as a 
whole. Amy epitomizes how we should all live 
our lives—as tireless and dedicated advocates 
for the diversity and inclusion of all people. I 
am proud to recognize Amy and thank her for 
being an inspiration to all of us.

HONORING JOEL SHERBURNE’S 65 
YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 30, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Joel Sherburne and his 65 
years of service to Calef’s Famous Country 
Store. Since age 17, Joel has served the 
Town of Barrington as Calef’s ‘‘Cheese Man,’’ 
sharing advice on how to care for your cheese 
and secret recipes using Calef’s famous 
‘‘Snappy Cheddar.’’ He has devoted himself to 
the safety, community and connectedness of 
his neighbors. Joel has been instrumental over 
the last six decades in bringing the people of 
Barrington together. 
Joel’s dedication to New Hampshire spans 
beyond his cheese expertise. He has taken on

an active role in serving his community, de-
signing the town sign and serving as Fair Am-
bassador to the Rochester Fair. Joel founded 
the Barrington Ambulance Service and taught 
EMT classes, which has saved countless lives 
and ensured that his neighbors have help 
should they need it. Joel even helped restore 
the nearby Rochester Opera House, inviting 
music and art into the lives of his neighbors. 
Joel’s commitment to Granite Staters was 
commemorated in 2017 with a United States 
Postal Service postmark. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I congratu-
late Joel for 65 years of service and thank him 
for his outstanding contributions to the com-
munity of Barrington.
