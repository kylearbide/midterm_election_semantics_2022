REMEMBERING WORLD WAR II 
VETERAN RALPH WAITE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, today, I rise to honor the life and 
legacy of World War II veteran Ralph 
Waite, a Medina native and northeast 
Ohio icon who died on February 18 at 
age 93. 
Ralph joined the Army in June 1944, 
immediately after his graduation from 
Medina High School. He served in the 
U.S. Army, 924th Field Artillery Bat-
talion, in the European theater and 
took part in the Battle of the Bulge. 
When he came home from the war in 
1946, Ralph married his high school 
sweetheart, Helen Clark, in 1948. To-
gether, they raised their twin sons, 
Harold and Darrell. 
He lived a life committed to serving 
his community and our Nation. Ralph 
was Scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 
501 for 36 years and active in Buckeye 
Boys State for 40 years, and he led the 
Medina Rotary Youth Exchange Pro-
gram. 
Ralph’s crowning honor in the com-
munity was the naming of Ralph E. 
Waite Elementary School in 2009. 
Ralph was an icon in the Medina 
community, known for his outstanding 
service to his church, our youth, and 
our veterans. Ralph’s life motto was: 
‘‘We occupy space on this Earth, and 
community service is the rent that we 
pay for the space that we are permitted 
to occupy.’’ 
Ralph lived by these words through-
out his life, and his legacy and example 
will live on in his children, grand-
children, great-grandchildren, and the 
entire community of Medina long into 
the future.

RECOGNIZING 
UNIVERSITY 
OF 
TEXAS 
RIO 
GRANDE 
VALLEY 
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. VELA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the University of Texas 
Rio Grande Valley School of Medicine 
on the successful establishment of a 
medical 
school, 
commemorated 
through the graduation of their inau-
gural class. 
The class of 2020 has established a 
precedent of success and excellence for 
the UTRGV School of Medicine and for 
all future classes to emulate. 
The establishment of the UTRGV 
School of Medicine followed decades- 
long efforts to ensure that Rio Grande 
Valley residents have access to quality 
healthcare services, an important mile-
stone for the region. 
From 1997 to 2009, a regional aca-
demic health center was opened and ef-
forts 
to 
build 
the 
resources 
and 
healthcare 
infrastructure 
were 
launched. The success of these efforts 
resulted in the Texas Legislature ap-
proving the creation of the medical 
school in 2013. 
In 2015, the UTRGV School of Medi-
cine received preliminary accredita-
tion, which allowed the university to 
recruit its first medical school class. 
The inaugural class will receive their 
doctor of medicine degrees on May 9, 
2020, when they will then go on to com-
plete 
specialized 
medical 
training 
across the country, including in south 
Texas. 
The UTRGV’s School of Medicine 
class of 2020 is the future of healthcare 
not only for the Rio Grande Valley but 
for this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the UTRGV 
School of Medicine’s first graduating 
class. Congratulations to the univer-
sity for their success. 
To these future physicians, thank 
you for choosing to be our Nation’s 
healers.

H1540 
March 9, 2020 
PRAYER 
Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-
itol Hill United Methodist Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
All-knowing and all-loving God, be-
fore we pray for the work of the peo-
ple’s House, let us pray for the people 
within. 
Thank You, God, for the gifts and 
graces of each person working here: 
Members, staffers, administrators, and 
more. You know the good that can be 
done through us. 
You also know, God, that, despite 
someone’s position or power, personal 
pain can seep in. Be with those among 
us, even in this Chamber, struggling 
with depression, wrestling with a bro-
ken relationship, or hiding some other 
hurt. Help us listen and walk with each 
other in a personal way. 
Out of that same compassion, guide 
our policy work. We give thanks for 
the physicians, scientists, local govern-
ment authorities, and public health 
workers—all those on the front line of 
the coronavirus and other devastation 
like in Tennessee. In our support of 
them, free us from political motiva-
tion. Make this a moment where we 
connect over the care of others, both 
those in our midst and all around the 
globe impacted by our work. 
Almighty God, make it so. 
Amen and amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has examined the Journal of the 
last day’s proceedings and announces 
to the House his approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. VELA led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
HONORING EMILY J. ALPERT 
(Mr. VELA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Emily J. Alpert for her 22 
years of extraordinary work and dedi-
cation to the Brownsville Community 
Health Center Corporation as the direc-
tor of operations. 
Emily has been instrumental in 
transforming the Brownsville Commu-
nity Health Center into the beacon of 
excellent 
healthcare services it is 
today. Her work embodies the philos-
ophy of providing quality care that 
preserves the dignity of all human 
beings, a philosophy engrained in the 
Rio Grande Valley. 
For these reasons, I would like to ask 
my colleagues to join the Brownsville 
Community Health Center and me in 
congratulating Emily on her retire-
ment and wishing her well in all of her 
future endeavors. 
f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
GLORIA MELNICK 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the memory and 
the legacy of Gloria Melnick, one of 
Bay Ridge’s most beloved and re-
spected community leaders. 
As a New York City public school 
teacher and president of the Bay Ridge 
Community Council, she worked for 
decades to bring positive change to her 
community. When Gloria took on a 
project, whether it was the community 
council’s Halloween art contest, the 
Ragamuffin Children’s Parade, or her 
work with the Bay Ridge Women’s 
Club, she gave it her all, even if that 
meant she had to work with people she 
disagreed with. 
Gloria’s tireless and heartfelt service 
for her community didn’t come from a 
place of selfishness. She didn’t care if 
she got any credit. She didn’t care who 
got the credit or attention. She was 
more than happy to keep a low profile 
and work behind the scenes, so long as 
it was making people’s lives better. 
At a time when productive dialogue 
and selfless leadership often seem to be 
in short supply, people like Gloria are 
a source of hope and inspiration for us 
all. We owe our teachers, our public 
servants, and our community leaders a 
huge debt of gratitude, and we all send 
Gloria’s family and the entire Bay 
Ridge community our condolences for 
their loss.

ADDING IRELAND TO E–3 
NONIMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2877) to add Ireland to the E–3 
nonimmigrant visa program. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2877 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. E–3 VISAS FOR IRISH NATIONALS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)(iii)) is amended by in-
serting ‘‘or, on a basis of reciprocity as de-
termined by the Secretary of State, a na-
tional of Ireland,’’ after ‘‘Australia’’. 
(b) EMPLOYER REQUIREMENTS.—Section 212 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1182) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating the second subsection 
(t) (as added by section 1(b)(2)(B) of Public 
Law 108–449 (118 Stat. 3470)) as subsection (u); 
and 
(2) by adding at the end of subsection (t)(1) 
(as added by section 402(b)(2) of Public Law 
108–77 (117 Stat. 941)) the following: 
‘‘(E) In the case of an attestation filed with 
respect to a national of Ireland described in 
section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii), the employer is, and 
will remain during the period of authorized 
employment of such Irish national, a partici-
pant in good standing in the E-Verify pro-
gram described in section 403(a) of the Illegal 
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Respon-
sibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note).’’. 
(c) APPLICATION
ALLOCATION.—Paragraph 
(11) of section 214(g) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(11)) is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(11)(A) The Secretary of State may ap-
prove initial applications submitted for 
aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(E)(iii) 
only as follows: 
‘‘(i) For applicants who are nationals of 
the Commonwealth of Australia, not more 
than 10,500 for a fiscal year. 
‘‘(ii) For applicants who are nationals of 
Ireland, not more than a number equal to 
the difference between 10,500 and the number 
of applications approved in the prior fiscal 
year for aliens who are nationals of the Com-
monwealth of Australia. 
‘‘(B) The approval of an application de-
scribed under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be 
deemed for numerical control purposes to 
have occurred on September 30 of the prior 
fiscal year. 
‘‘(C) The numerical limitation under sub-
paragraph (A) shall only apply to principal 
aliens and not to the spouses or children of 
such aliens.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) and the 
gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2877, a bill to add Ireland to the E–3 
nonimmigrant visa program. 
In 2005, soon after the United States 
and Australia finalized the Australia- 
U.S. Free Trade Agreement, Congress 
created the E–3 visa program. That 
program provides up to 10,500 tem-
porary visas for Australian nationals 
who are pre-approved by U.S. Citizen-
ship and Immigration Services to work 
in a specialty occupation for a spon-
soring United States employer. 
A specialty occupation is one that re-
quires the theoretical and practical ap-
plication of a body of highly special-
ized 
knowledge 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
science, engineering, and research and 
development in emerging technologies. 
Since the program’s inception, Aus-
tralia has only ever used a fraction of 
the 10,500 E–3 visas that are available 
each year. For example, in fiscal year 
2019, only 5,800 E–3 visas were issued to 
Australian nationals. 
H.R. 2877 does not increase the num-
ber of visas that may be issued, but in-
stead allows Irish nationals to use any 
unused visas. That bill would take the 
number of E–3 visas that are left un-
used by Australia in a given fiscal year 
and make that same number of visas 
available to Irish nationals the fol-
lowing fiscal year. 
This is a commonsense bill that rec-
ognizes the important bond we share 
with two of our country’s closest and 
most steadfast allies. This bill is not 
controversial, and, in fact, passed the 
House by voice vote in 2018 when my 
Republican colleagues held the major-
ity in this Chamber. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
my 
friend, Mr. NEAL, chairman of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means, for con-
tinuing to champion this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 2877, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2877, a bill to add Ireland to the 
E–3 nonimmigrant visa program. 
As we approach St. Patrick’s Day, 
this bill recognizes the unique friend-
ship and working relationship between 
the United States and Ireland. 
H.R. 2877 allows nationals of Ireland 
to be eligible to apply for unused E–3 
nonimmigrant visas subject to Ireland 
providing reciprocal access to U.S. na-
tionals. Holders of the E–3 temporary 
work visa must be working in a spe-
cialty occupation while in the United 
States. 
A specialty occupation is one that is 
defined in the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act as requiring: 
One, ‘‘theoretical and practical appli-
cation of a body of highly specialized 
knowledge; and 
Two, ‘‘attainment of a bachelor’s or 
higher degree in the specific specialty, 
or its equivalent, as a minimum for 
entry into the occupation in the United 
States.’’ 
The E–3 applicant must have a job 
offer from an employer in the United 
States, and that employer must get a 
foreign labor certification from the 
U.S. Department of Labor prior to fil-
ing a petition with U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services. 
H.R. 2877 also requires that employ-
ers using Irish E–3 visa holders in their 
workforce are, and will remain, partici-
pants in good standing in the E-Verify 
program. This means that such em-
ployers must use E-Verify to ensure 
those that they employ are eligible to 
work in the United States. 
E–3 nonimmigrant visas are cur-
rently only available to nationals of 
Australia and are capped at 10,500 per 
year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1542 
March 9, 2020 
Australian nationals have never used 
all of the 10,500 authorized visas in a 
given year, nor have they even come 
close to doing so. In fact, the highest 
number used was during the last fiscal 
year when 5,807 were issued. 
H.R. 2877 provides that nationals of 
Ireland can utilize the visas not used 
by Australians in a given calendar 
year. For operational purposes, the 
visa can be issued for the following 
year but will be counted against the 
previous year’s cap. So the bill does 
not increase the number of visas au-
thorized 
and 
allows Australia, for 
whose nationals the program was origi-
nally created, to have first access to 
those numbers. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2877 is a simple bill 
that reflects the continued friendship 
between Ireland and the United States. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. NEAL). 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2877, to make Irish nationals el-
igible for temporary admission to the 
United States through the existing E–3 
visa program. 
And I thank the gentleman from 
North Dakota for his offering today 
and his support. I worked last year 
with Chairman SENSENBRENNER on this 
as well. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation has 
broad support, and last session it 
passed the Congress unanimously. 
Created in 2005 as a result of the 
U.S.-Australian 
Trade 
Agreement— 
which I voted for, supported, and spoke 
in support of—the agreement said, es-
sentially, that the E–3 visa program, as 
constructed, would make 10,500 visas 
annually available to skilled Aus-
tralian nationals for temporary work. 
This program has been a successful 
pathway for qualified Australian citi-
zens to gain valuable professional expe-
rience in the United States. However, 
our Australian friends have only used 
roughly half of the available visas dur-
ing the past decade. 
E–3 visas are limited to professionals 
visiting the United States to perform 
services in specialty occupations in a 
confirmed job from a United States 
employer. 
E–3 visa applicants also must have a 
university degree, or its equivalent, as 
a minimum for entry into the United 
States. The E–3 visa allows the holder 
to stay in America for 2 years with the 
option to renew. 
This legislation—and I want to make 
sure that we emphasize this—this legis-
lation does not change the require-
ments of the current E–3 visa program 
recipients or increase the number of 
visas made available. In broad strokes, 
my bill will simply enable qualified 
Irish workers to annually access un-
used Australian E–3 visas from the pre-
vious fiscal year. Once passed, the Irish 
Government has pledged to adopt a re-
ciprocal arrangement that would allow 
Americans to work in Ireland under 
the same guidelines. 
The E–3 visas, combined with these 
reciprocal arrangements, would pro-
vide a welcome and long overdue move-
ment of citizens between Ireland and 
the United States in both directions, 
which is so important to Irish America, 
the United States, and, indeed, Ireland. 
As many of you in this Chamber al-
ready know, legal migration between 
the United States and Ireland has been 
extremely limited now for many, many 
years. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I note the 
support that we have across the United 
States and unanimously in the Con-
gress. It has the backing of both the 
White House and the Irish Government, 
whose prime minister, Leo Varadkar, 
the Taoiseach, will be welcomed to the 
Capitol on Thursday for the annual St. 
Patrick’s Day luncheon. 
In my opinion, this bill is a win-win 
opportunity for the United States and 
for Ireland, and for the citizens of both 
countries who will benefit from this 
very innovative and beneficial ex-
change program. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Committee 
on the Judiciary chairman, JERRY NAD-
LER, and Judiciary’s Subcommittee on 
Immigration and Citizenship chair-
woman, ZOE LOFGREN, for swiftly mov-
ing this legislation to the floor. And I 
do take special note of JIM SENSEN-
BRENNER’s contribution for helping us 
get to this moment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 2877. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill is pretty sim-
ple. The opening is the closing. This is 
one of those times where I think com-
mon sense prevails. We are not increas-
ing visas. We are continuing a strong 
relationship between Ireland and the 
United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I would 
urge my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2877. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS 
TO GUAM WORLD WAR II LOY-
ALTY RECOGNITION ACT 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and concur 
in the Senate amendment to the bill 
(H.R. 1365) to make technical correc-
tions to the Guam World War II Loy-
alty Recognition Act. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the Senate amendment is 
as follows: 
Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO GUAM 
WORLD WAR II LOYALTY RECOGNI-
TION ACT. 
Title XVII of division A of Public Law 114–328 
is amended— 
(1) in section 1703(e)— 
(A) by striking ‘‘equal to’’ and inserting ‘‘not 
to exceed’’; and 
(B) by striking ‘‘covered into the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts’’ and inserting ‘‘used to 
reimburse the applicable appropriations’’; 
(2) in section 1704(a) by striking ‘‘, subject to 
the availability of appropriations,’’ and insert-
ing ‘‘from the Claims Fund’’; and 
(3) by striking section 1707(a). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) and the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Guam. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Guam? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, at the risk of sounding 
melodramatic, today is a very historic 
day, particularly in the relationship 
between the United States and the peo-
ple of Guam; more specifically, the 
Chamorro people of Guam, a genera-
tion, in particular, that endured the 
sufferings of World War II. 
Mr. Speaker, I was here about 8 
months ago when I first brought H.R. 
1365 to the floor of this House after se-
curing unanimous consent in the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources. And after 
bringing this measure to this floor 8 
months ago and also securing unani-
mous consent, H.R. 1365 made its way 
to the Senate. And in going through 
the Senate, it was able to also receive 
the necessary unanimous support and 
receive a very minor change that 
brings us to the floor today. 
H.R. 1365 technically is making what 
would appear to be a minor change to 
language that was already enacted in 
the 2010 NDAA. 
b 1615 
In my short time as a freshman Mem-
ber of this House, I have learned that 
there is no such thing as a simple tech-
nicality. I have learned that the mere 
addition of a few words, or the subtrac-
tion of a few words, can make all the 
difference between the gravity of the

hurdles that you need to overcome in 
order to be able to enact legislation. 
I have learned that the language con-
tained in H.R. 1365, while technical in 
nature, is incredibly significant with 
respect to what it means for the Mem-
bers of this House to consider. 
In our process, Mr. Speaker, legisla-
tion that has certain language triggers 
certain events. H.R. 1365 is intended to 
allow for money that has been set aside 
to 
actually 
be 
paid 
out 
to 
the 
Chamorros, who suffered under the bru-
tality of Imperial Japan during World 
War II. 
This was a process that was initiated 
over many decades and has finally 
come to a place where we now just 
await the ability to cut the checks. 
But it is in the ability to cut those 
checks that language actually gets 
very, very complicated, and it causes 
certain things to be reconsidered. 
The language in H.R. 1365 would, in 
effect, create what we know as a scor-
ing here in this Congress, meaning that 
there may be an expenditure that the 
body would need to consider. The ac-
tual funding source of H.R. 1365 was a 
set-aside of moneys that was already 
due to Guam and has been set aside 
over the past several years, with the 
money accumulating and being ready 
to be paid out to these war survivors. 
The reason why the United States is 
assuming this obligation, Mr. Speaker, 
is because, at the end of World War II, 
the United States absolved Japan of 
their obligations in order to be able to 
move the entire world forward after 
the conclusion of the war. In so doing, 
they also just so happened to absolve 
them of their obligation to make whole 
the war crimes that were endured by 
the Chamorro people who suffered be-
cause they were inhabiting the United 
States territory of Guam at the time. 
The people suffered beheadings, forced 
marches, rapes, and the loss of their in-
fants in their arms. 
It has taken us now going on 76 years 
to finally come to this point. I say that 
this is historic, Mr. Speaker, because 
it, in a large respect, represents almost 
an original sin, in terms of the inabil-
ity for us to reconcile our territorial 
relationships in a manner that really 
makes for plain and simple justice. 
I am deeply moved, Mr. Speaker, to 
be able to handle these proceedings 
today and to be able to see H.R. 1356 
come before this House once more be-
cause, as we all know, in this current 
political environment, almost any hur-
dle that legislation faces is a hurdle 
too much. 
As we have gone through this process 
and have gotten to this point, there 
were many times when I was deeply 
concerned about whether or not some-
thing technical was going to actually 
be dead on arrival. But by the grace of 
God, Mr. Speaker, the small territory 
of Guam has been able to garner the 
unanimous support of this House, the 
unanimous support of the Senate. We 
are here again today addressing a mat-
ter that really triggers certain con-
cerns but has gotten us to a point 
where we are able to see that there are 
some things that are bigger than the 
nuances of language, the semantics of 
procedure. 
So it is with a deep sense of pride 
that I stand here, as a Member of this 
House, nonvoting Delegate that I am, 
because I can stand here in witness to 
the fact that, at some point in time, 
justice really does find its way in the 
United States of America. 
I urge my colleagues to please sup-
port this measure. We are this close; 
we are just a hairline away. And in 
passing this House, this measure will 
then go before the President for signa-
ture, and we can finally make whole a 
generation that suffered because they 
were loyal to America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
This is a problem that has been vex-
ing representatives from our territory 
of Guam for many years now. I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Guam, who 
has adequately explained what he is at-
tempting to do and what this bill actu-
ally does. I congratulate him on this 
bill, which is finally going to recognize 
and compensate a very small group but 
a significant group of people who lit-
erally sacrificed for this country. 
This is the right thing to do. This 
House has done this before. This passed 
out of our committee on a voice vote. 
It has passed on the floor on a voice 
vote. It then went to the Senate, where 
the Senate felt compelled to make 
changes, as is their wont to do. And in 
lightning speed, the Senate, in only 8 
months, was able to strike the 22 lines 
and return this bill to us. 
So, lest we vex them even further and 
ask them to do something else, I would 
urge everyone in here to give this an-
other ‘‘yes’’ vote and send this on to 
the President’s desk immediately from 
this floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN 
NICOLAS) that the House suspend the 
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the bill, H.R. 1365. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the Senate 
amendment was concurred in. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SUPPORTING 
PEOPLE 
OF 
NICA-
RAGUA IN THEIR PEACEFUL EF-
FORTS 
TO 
PROMOTE 
DEMOC-
RACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 754) expressing the sense 
of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should continue to 
support the people of Nicaragua in 
their peaceful efforts to promote de-
mocracy and human rights, and use the 
tools under United States law to in-
crease political and financial pressure 
on the government of Daniel Ortega, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 754 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has concentrated power and brought about 
the progressive deterioration of democratic 
conditions in Nicaragua; 
Whereas recent elections in Nicaragua, in-
cluding the 2016 Presidential elections, have 
been marred by irregularities and character-
ized by significant restrictions on the par-
ticipation of opposition parties and the ab-
sence of credible international and local 
electoral observers; 
Whereas 
Nicaraguan 
security 
forces, 
parapolice, and other actors working under 
the direction of the Ortega regime com-
mitted gross violations of human rights and 
acts of repression, resulting in more than 325 
deaths, over 2,000 injuries, and at least 800 
arbitrary detentions during the peaceful pro-
tests that took place in 2018, according to 
the Organization of American States; 
Whereas a report by the Interdisciplinary 
Group of Independent Experts, appointed by 
the Organization of American States Inter- 
American Commission on Human Rights, de-
termined that the Ortega regime used delib-
erate, lethal force against protesters and 
committed acts of torture that meet the 
international 
legal 
standard 
of 
crimes 
against humanity; 
Whereas an estimated 62,000 Nicaraguans 
fled the country between April 2018 and April 
2019, according to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees; 
Whereas the Ortega government reneged 
on its commitment in 2019 to release all po-
litical prisoners by releasing just 392 people, 
of which 286 were released to house arrest 
with charges still pending, while the Blue 
and White National Unity coalition alleges 
that there remain at least 56 political pris-
oners as of February 15, 2020; 
Whereas a United States citizen and Navy 
veteran, 57-year-old Eddy Montes, was shot 
and killed while in the custody of the Nica-
raguan police at La Modelo Prison on May 
16, 2019; 
Whereas the government of Daniel Ortega 
has severely restricted freedom of the press 
by closing five local television stations, at-
tacking independent radio stations, arbi-
trarily detaining journalists, and illegally 
restricting print supplies from entering the 
country; 
Whereas the Ortega regime has violated 
the economic and political rights protections 
of 
indigenous 
communities, 
rural 
campesinos, land rights defenders, and those 
living in the Caribbean Autonomous Regions 
of Nicaragua; 
Whereas, on November 27, 2018, Executive 
Order 13851 was issued, which blocks the 
property of certain persons contributing to 
the situation in Nicaragua, and its applica-
tion was expanded on September 4, 2019; 
Whereas the Departments of State and the 
Treasury have imposed targeted sanctions on 
over 20 Nicaraguan individuals and entities, 
including First Lady and Vice President 
Rosario Murillo and Daniel Ortega’s son, 
Laureano Ortega, as well as Nicaragua’s 
Banco Corporativo (Bancorp);

ment Conditionality Act (NICA Act), was

signed into law on December 20, 2018, allow-
ing the Department of the Treasury to sanc-
tion non-United States persons implicated in 
egregious human rights abuses and corrup-
tion in Nicaragua; 
Whereas, in June 2019, Canada imposed 
sanctions on 12 members of the Nicaraguan 
Government engaged in gross and systemic 
human rights violations; 
Whereas the Ortega government has not 
complied with efforts of the commission ap-
pointed by the Permanent Council of the Or-
ganization of American States seeking a 
peaceful resolution to the social and polit-
ical crisis; 
Whereas, on September 15, 2019, the Ortega 
government denied entry into the country to 
an official Organization of American States 
delegation mission; and 
Whereas, beginning on November 14, 2019, 
Nicaraguan police conducted attacks on 
churches throughout the country, cut water 
to hunger strikers barricaded inside a church 
in Masaya, and arrested 13 people attempting 
to bring them water: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on the Nicaraguan Government to 
immediately release all political prisoners 
without conditions and cease all acts of vio-
lence, repression, and intimidation against 
dissenting voices in Nicaragua; 
(2) condemns the Nicaraguan Government’s 
continued failure to comply with agreements 
made with the Organization of American 
States; 
(3) urges the Ortega government to respect 
Nicaraguans’ constitutional rights and im-
plement electoral reforms including free, 
fair, multiparty elections open to inter-
national observers, in compliance with the 
agreement 
reached 
through 
negotiations 
with the Civic Alliance for Justice and De-
mocracy and the Blue and White National 
Unity (UNAB) in March 2019; 
(4) expresses full support for the people of 
Nicaragua, Nicaraguan independent media, 
and Nicaraguan civil society organizations 
that are working for a peaceful return to 
democratic order in Nicaragua; 
(5) recognizes and supports efforts of the 
United States Government to promote de-
mocracy in Nicaragua and hold corrupt ac-
tors and human rights abusers in the Nica-
raguan Government accountable for their ac-
tions; 
(6) urges the United States Government to 
continue to apply pressure on the Ortega 
government and consider additional sanc-
tions against those Nicaraguan officials who 
have violated the human rights of their citi-
zens or committed acts of significant corrup-
tion; and 
(7) urges the international community to 
hold the Ortega government accountable for 
human rights abuses, including attacks on 
religious freedom, and restrict its access to 
foreign financing unless or until it allows for 
free, fair, and prompt elections monitored by 
credible international and local electoral ob-
servers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H. Res. 754. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by 
thanking Chairman ENGEL and Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL for their contin-
ued focus on the human rights situa-
tion in Nicaragua. 
I would also like to thank my col-
league, Ranking Member FRANCIS ROO-
NEY from Florida, for working with me 
to introduce this resolution. 
This resolution highlights the severe 
human rights abuses that have taken 
place in Nicaragua and conveys bipar-
tisan support for the Nicaraguan peo-
ple as they seek to reclaim their funda-
mental rights. 
In 2018, repression by Nicaraguan se-
curity forces resulted in over 325 
deaths. 
According 
to 
international 
human rights groups, Nicaraguan secu-
rity forces used a deliberate strategy of 
shooting to kill, committing abuses 
that rose to the level of crimes against 
humanity. 
While President Ortega has since re-
leased hundreds of political prisoners, 
seemingly in an effort to reduce inter-
national pressure, there remain at 
least 56 political prisoners in Nica-
ragua. Moreover, many of those who 
were released are still routinely har-
assed by the authorities. Political pris-
oners in Nicaragua are subjected to 
sexual abuse, suffocation with plastic 
bags, and electric shocks. 
Over 80,000 Nicaraguans have fled the 
country since April 2018, many of them 
to escape persecution. I urge the ad-
ministration not to turn its back to 
Nicaraguans who come to the United 
States fleeing violence and persecu-
tion. 
This resolution makes clear that the 
United States Congress stands with the 
Nicaraguan people, who are demanding 
accountability in the face of such bru-
tal repression. It calls for tangible 
steps from the Nicaraguan Govern-
ment, including immediate release of 
all political prisoners and the imple-
mentation of electoral reforms that 
Nicaraguan civil society organizations 
have long called for. 
I hope that my colleagues will join 
me in sending this strong bipartisan 
message in support of the Nicaraguan 
people. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H. Res. 754, 
expressing the support of the people of 
Nicaragua in their peaceful effort to 
promote democracy and human rights, 
authored by the chairman of the West-
ern Hemisphere, Civilian Security, and 
Trade Subcommittee, Mr. SIRES. 
Daniel Ortega and his socialist San-
dinista government continue to hold 
onto power through corruption, intimi-
dation, and violence against the people 
of Nicaragua. 
Since his return to power in 2007, Or-
tega, an ally of Venezuelan dictator 
Nicolas Maduro and the Castro regime 
in Cuba, has dismantled Nicaragua’s 
democratic institutions and enriched 
himself and his family at the expense 
of the people of one of the poorest 
countries in the Western Hemisphere. 
In 2018, Nicaraguan security forces 
directed by Ortega violently suppressed 
peaceful protests that led to at least 
325 deaths, 2,000 injuries, and the arbi-
trary detention of more than 800 Nica-
raguans. 
Since then, Ortega has resisted calls 
by the international community to re-
store respect for human rights in the 
country and pass reforms to allow for 
free and fair elections. 
In response, the United States im-
posed 
individual 
sanctions 
on 
Nicaragua’s First Lady and two of 
Ortega’s sons. The Treasury Depart-
ment 
also 
sanctioned 
one 
of 
Nicaragua’s main banks and, most re-
cently, Nicaragua’s National Police for 
continuing to facilitate corruption and 
carry out human rights violations on 
behalf of the Ortega regime. 
This resolution condemns the actions 
of the Ortega regime and expresses full 
support for the freedom-loving people 
of Nicaragua in their struggle for de-
mocracy and freedom from Ortega’s 
tyranny. 
This resolution also recognizes the 
administration’s effort to promote de-
mocracy in Nicaragua and the actions 
it has taken to hold corrupt officials 
and human rights abusers accountable. 
The United States remains com-
mitted to democracy and respect for 
human rights in the Western Hemi-
sphere, and this resolution urges the 
international community in joining us 
in these efforts. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Consideration 
of 
this 
resolution 
comes at an important moment for 
Nicaragua. As the 2021 elections ap-
proach, it will be key for the inter-
national community to speak with one 
voice in demanding that specific condi-
tions be met in order for those elec-
tions to be deemed credible. 
As a first step, President Ortega 
must take immediate action to allow 
for the creation of a newly comprised 
and independent electoral council, the 
development of a reliable voter reg-
istry, and the granting of full access to 
international election observers for the 
2021 elections. 
Absent immediate and tangible steps 
to implement these electoral reforms, 
the United States should increase its 
pressure on Ortega and his inner circle. 
I hope our allies in Europe will also 
step up their efforts and work with the 
United States toward a coordinated 
sanctions strategy. 
I thank my colleagues for sending 
this bipartisan message that we will

ENCOURAGING REUNIONS OF DI-
VIDED KOREAN-AMERICAN FAMI-
LIES 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 410) encouraging re-
unions of divided Korean-American 
families, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 410 
Whereas the Korean Peninsula, with the 
Republic of Korea (in this resolution referred 
to as ‘‘South Korea’’) in the South and the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (in 
this resolution referred to as ‘‘North Korea’’) 
in the North, remains divided following the 
signing of the Korean War Armistice Agree-
ment on July 27, 1953; 
Whereas the division of the Korean Penin-
sula separated more than 10,000,000 Korean 
family members, including some who are 
now citizens of the United States; 
Whereas there have been 21 rounds of fam-
ily reunions between South Koreans and 
North Koreans along the border since 2000; 
Whereas Congress signaled its support for 
family reunions between United States citi-
zens and their relatives in North Korea in 
section 1265 of the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 
110–181), signed into law by President George 
W. Bush on January 28, 2008; 
Whereas most of the population of divided 
family members in the United States, ini-
tially estimated at 100,000 in 2001, has signifi-
cantly dwindled as many of the individuals 
have passed away; 
Whereas the summit between North Korea 
and South Korea on April 27, 2018, has 
prioritized family reunions; 
Whereas the United States and North 
Korea have engaged in talks during 2 his-
toric summits in June 2018 in Singapore and 
February 2019 in Hanoi; and 
Whereas many Korean Americans are wait-
ing for a chance to meet their relatives in 
North Korea for the first time in more than 
60 years: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on the United States and North 
Korea to begin the process of reuniting Ko-
rean-American divided family members with 
their immediate relatives through ways such 
as— 
(A) identifying divided families in the 
United States and North Korea who are will-
ing and able to participate in a pilot pro-
gram for family reunions; 
(B) finding matches for members of such 
families through organizations such as the 
Red Cross; and 
(C) working with the Government of South 
Korea to include American citizens in inter- 
Korean video reunions; 
(2) reconfirms the institution of family as 
inalienable and, accordingly, urges the res-
toration of contact between divided families 
physically, literarily, or virtually; and 
(3) calls on the United States and North 
Korea to pursue reunions as a humanitarian 
priority of immediate concern. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H. Res. 410. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentative BASS for sponsoring this 
resolution, which draws attention to a 
pressing humanitarian issue affecting 
the Korean-American community. 
This June will mark 70 years since 
the beginning of the Korean war, which 
separated 10 million Koreans from 
their 
immediate 
family 
members. 
Since 1985, family reunions carried out 
between the North and the South brief-
ly reunited more than 20,000 family 
members, but there are still thousands 
more who have brothers, sisters, or 
parents who have been separated for 
decades. 
It must be a humanitarian priority 
for the United States to facilitate re-
unions for these separated families. 
Considering the many years that have 
passed, many of these families are 
older, and if we don’t act soon, they 
may never see their loved ones again. 
The measure before us underscores 
the long history of U.S. support for 
family reunification between Korean 
Americans and their relatives still in 
North Korea. It outlines different ways 
that North Korea and the United 
States can respectively take action, in-
cluding a pilot program for family re-
unions, a family registry supported by 
the Red Cross and other organizations, 
and the use of technology to allow re-
unions for those who might not be 
physically able to travel for in-person 
reunions. 
This is a good, commonsense resolu-
tion reiterating our country’s commit-
ment to reuniting families split by the 
Korean war. I support it, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of Representative BASS’ res-
olution, and I want to congratulate her 
for doing this. 
This resolution reaffirms the House’s 
commitment to support our Korean- 
American families seeking to reunite 
with relatives who are trapped in 
North Korea. This resolution rightly 
observes that family reunification is a 
humanitarian priority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BASS), the author of this 
important resolution and the chair-
woman of the Foreign Affairs Sub-
committee on Africa, Global Health, 
Global 
Human 
Rights, 
and 
Inter-
national Organizations. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to strongly support H. Res. 410. The 
purpose of this resolution is to encour-
age reunions of divided Korean-Amer-
ican families. 
Last year, I had the opportunity to 
meet Kyung Joo Lee, a 90-year-old Ko-
rean-American man from Virginia. Mr. 
Lee has not seen his three older broth-
ers and sisters since he fled North 
Korea more than 70 years ago, but he 
prays for them daily. He has no idea if 
they 
are 
even 
still 
alive. 
Tears 
streamed down his face during that 
meeting as he held my hands and urged 
me to do what I can to help Korean 
families to be reunited. 
This resolution originated at a town-
hall meeting where a group of constitu-
ents called this issue to my attention. 
As I learned more about these aging 
Korean Americans who just want to be 
able to see their siblings and parents, I 
knew that we had to do all that we 
could do to raise this issue. 
The division of the Korean Peninsula 
into South Korea and North Korea sep-
arated thousands of Koreans from fam-
ily members. Many Korean Americans 
have not seen or communicated with 
family members in more than 60 years. 
Their children have grown up here in 
America without knowing what their 
cousins, aunts, or uncles even look 
like. 
Over the years, South Korea and 
North Korea have arranged for selected 
groups to visit each other, but these re-
unions have been dependent on the po-
litical situation between the countries. 
Since 2000, there have been at least 20 
rounds of family reunions, but none 
have included Korean Americans. 
Meanwhile, the situation is now 
growing more urgent as many who 
have been separated are getting older. 
Most are in their late eighties or nine-
ties. That is why I introduced this res-
olution that calls on the United States 
and North Korea to begin the process 
of reuniting Korean-American divided 
family members with their immediate 
relatives. 
Today, I am proud to stand with my 
colleagues in getting one step closer to 
reunifying Mr. Lee and so many others 
with their families. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this resolution that calls on the

sue reunions as a humanitarian pri-
ority of immediate concern. I also urge 
them to support H.R. 1771, the Divided 
Families Reunification Act, introduced 
by my colleague Representative GRACE 
MENG, that takes up the same issue. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I 
urge my colleagues to support Rep-
resentative BASS’ resolution to stand 
with Korean Americans seeking to re-
unite with family members stranded 
inside North Korea. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, most of us can’t imag-
ine the pain of going decades without 
knowing if your relatives are alive or 
dead. That is the daily struggle for 
thousands of families torn apart by the 
Korean war. 
Mr. Speaker, this measure under-
scores our support for reuniting these 
families, bringing solace and closure to 
this deep wound left by the war. I hope 
my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting this resolution, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SIRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H.

The question was taken.

EASTERN EUROPEAN SECURITY 
ACT 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2444) to authorize the Secretary 
of State to make direct loans under 
section 23 of the Arms Export Control 
Act, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2444 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Eastern Eu-
ropean Security Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that it is in the 
national security interest of the United 
States to— 
(1) deter aggression against North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) allies by Russia 
or any other adversary; 
(2) assist NATO allies in acquiring and de-
ploying modern, NATO interoperable mili-
tary equipment and reducing their depend-
ence on Russian or former Soviet-era defense 
articles; 
(3) ensure that NATO allies meet alliance 
defense commitments, including through 
adequate investments in national defense; 
(4) supplement existing grant assistance to 
key allies through foreign military financing 
loans, at rates competitive with those al-
ready available on commercial markets, to 
purchase 
NATO-interoperable 
military 
equipment; and 
(5) work to maintain and strengthen the 
democratic institutions and practices of all 
NATO allies, in accordance with the goals of 
Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty. 
SEC. 3. FOREIGN MILITARY LOAN AUTHORITY. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Beginning in fiscal year 
2021, subject to the notification requirements 
under subsection (b) and to the availability 
of appropriations, the President, acting 
through the Secretary of State, is author-
ized— 
(1) to make direct loans under section 23 of 
the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763) 
to NATO member countries that joined the 
alliance after March 1, 1999, notwithstanding 
the minimum interest rate required by sub-
section (c)(1) of such section; and 
(2) to charge fees for such loans under 
paragraph (1), which shall be collected from 
borrowers in accordance with section 502(7) 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and 
which may be used to cover the costs of such 
loans as defined in section 502 of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974. 
(b) NOTIFICATION.—A loan may not be made 
under the authority provided by subsection 
(a) unless the Secretary of State submits to 
the appropriate congressional committees a 
certification, not fewer than fifteen days be-
fore entering into an agreement to make 
such loan, that— 
(1) the recipient country is making demon-
strable progress toward meeting its defense 
spending commitments in accordance with 
the 2014 NATO Wales Summit Declaration; 
and 
(2) the government of such recipient coun-
try is respecting that country’s constitution 
and upholds democratic values such as free-
dom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom 
of the press, the rule of law, and the rights 
of religious minorities. 
(c) REPAYMENT.—A loan made under the 
authority provided by subsection (a) shall be 
repaid in not more than 12 years, but may in-
clude a grace period of up to one year on the

TEES DEFINED.—In this Act, the term ‘‘appro-
priate congressional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 2444. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2444, the Eastern European Security 
Act. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
MCCAUL for working on this excellent 
measure that mirrors Chairman ELIOT 
ENGEL’s bill, the NATO Defense Fi-
nancing Act, in pursuit of a stronger 
transatlantic partnership. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States and 
its European allies have, together, 
built the most successful alliance in 
the history of the world. The NATO al-
liance is strengthened by our shared 
values, mutual trust, ability to work 
together, and, if necessary, to fight to-
gether. 
It is crucial that NATO is ready and 
able to defend against external threats 
and engage in combat. For that to hap-
pen, all of our allies must be able to 
work together seamlessly. But right 
now, some of our Eastern European al-
lies still rely on Russian or old Soviet 
era equipment. Modernizing these mili-
tary forces is a national security im-
perative. 
The Eastern European Security Act 
puts in place direct loans to our secu-
rity partners so they can update their 
military equipment to better address 
their shifting and complex security 
needs. As adversaries like Russia con-
tinue to test our alliance’s defenses 
and cohesion, these loans would be a 
meaningful step towards ensuring that 
we are ready and able to face evolving 
threats on the horizon. 
These loans will complement, not re-
place, our ongoing U.S. security assist-
ance effort to Europe and will be condi-
tioned upon our allies upholding their 
own constitutions and the democratic 
values of the alliance. 
The United States must not only sup-
port the militaries of our NATO allies, 
but 
also 
safeguard 
the 
continued 
strength of the democratic values upon 
which the alliance is built. I hope all 
Members will join me in approving this 
measure that better supports our Euro-
pean allies and advances the United 
States’ national security interests. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of the Eastern 
European Security Act, introduced by 
the lead Republican of the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee, Mr. MICHAEL MCCAUL. 
This bipartisan bill supports our NATO 
allies and American jobs and is the 
best way to secure the NATO alliance. 
The NATO alliance is essential to our 
national security, but it is only as 
strong as its most vulnerable members. 
Some newer member countries with 
smaller economies want to purchase 
American military hardware, but such 
purchases are often out of reach. As a 
result, these partner nations are forced 
to purchase less expensive and, often, 
less reliable military equipment from 
other allies or even our strategic com-
petitors, Russia and China. Such pur-
chases threaten America’s security as 
well as the security of the alliance.

H1547 
March 9, 2020 
This bill would give the executive 
branch the flexibility it needs to help 
secure the sale of American military 
equipment to our NATO allies, which 
will not only promote our national se-
curity interests but, also, promote 
American jobs and bring in revenue to 
the treasury over the life of the loan. 
This legislation is long overdue, and 
I ask my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this very important bipartisan 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank 
Congressman MCCAUL
for his hard 
work on this measure. He has been a 
tireless advocate on behalf of this 
issue. 
NATO security is U.S. security, and 
the 
continued 
protection 
of 
every 
American is dependent upon a strong 
NATO alliance. Our allies selflessly 
demonstrated this commitment when 
they came to America’s aid after the 
terrorist attack of 9/11, and it is impor-
tant that the United States remain 
committed to our allies and our shared 
democratic values as well. 
This is a good measure, and I am 
pleased to support it. I urge all Mem-
bers to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SIRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2444, as

The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DIVIDED FAMILIES 
REUNIFICATION ACT 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1771) to require consultations on 
reuniting Korean Americans with fam-
ily members in North Korea, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1771 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Divided 
Families Reunification Act’’. 
SEC. 2. CONSULTATIONS ON REUNITING KOREAN 
AMERICANS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS 
IN NORTH KOREA. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The division of the Korean Peninsula 
into South Korea and North Korea separated 
thousands of Koreans from family members. 
(2) Since the signing of the Agreement 
Concerning a Military Armistice in Korea, 
signed at Panmunjom July 27, 1953 (com-
monly referred to as the ‘‘Korean War Armi-
stice Agreement’’), there has been little to 
no contact between Korean Americans and 
family members who remain in North Korea. 
(3) North Korea and South Korea first 
agreed to reunions of divided families in 1985 
and have since held 21 face-to-face reunions 
and multiple video link reunions. 
(4) Those reunions have subsequently given 
approximately 24,500 Koreans the oppor-
tunity to briefly reunite with loved ones. 
(5) The most recent family reunions be-
tween North Korea and South Korea took 
place in August 2018 and did not include any 
Korean Americans. 
(6) The United States and North Korea do 
not maintain diplomatic relations and cer-
tain limitations exist on Korean Americans 
participating in face-to-face reunions. 
(7) According to the most recent census, 
more than 1,700,000 people living in the 
United States are of Korean descent. 
(8) The number of first generation Korean 
and Korean American family members di-
vided from family members in North Korea 
is rapidly diminishing given the advanced 
age of those family members. More than 3,000 
elderly South Koreans die each year without 
having been reunited with their family mem-
bers. 
(9) Many Korean Americans with family 
members in North Korea have not seen or 
communicated with those family members in 
more than 60 years. 
(10) The inclusion of Korean American fam-
ilies in the reunion process would constitute 
a positive humanitarian gesture by the Gov-
ernment of North Korea. 
(11) Section 1265 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Pub-
lic Law 110–181; 122 Stat. 407) required the 
President to submit to Congress a report on 
‘‘efforts, if any, of the United States Govern-
ment to facilitate family reunions between 
United States citizens and their relatives in 
North Korea’’. 
(12) The position of Special Envoy on 
North Korean Human Rights Issues has been 
vacant since January 2017, although the 
President is required to appoint a Senate- 
confirmed Special Envoy to fill this position 
in accordance with section 107 of the North 
Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 
7817). 
(13) In the report of the Committee on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives 
accompanying H.R. 3081, 111th Congress 
(House Report 111–187), the Committee urged 
‘‘the Special Representative on North Korea 
Policy, as the senior official handling North 
Korea issues, to prioritize the issues involv-
ing Korean divided families and to, if nec-
essary, appoint a coordinator for such fami-
lies’’. 
(b) CONSULTATIONS.— 
(1) CONSULTATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA.—The 
Secretary of State, or a designee of the Sec-
retary, should consult with officials of South 
Korea, as appropriate, on potential opportu-
nities to reunite Korean American families 
with family members in North Korea from 
which such Korean American families were 
divided after the signing of the Korean War 
Armistice Agreement, including potential 
opportunities for video reunions for Korean 
Americans with such family members. 
(2) CONSULTATIONS
WITH
KOREAN
AMERI-
CANS.—The Special Envoy on North Korean 
Human Rights Issues of the Department of 
State should regularly consult with rep-
resentatives of Korean Americans who have 
family members in North Korea with respect 
to efforts to reunite families divided after 
the signing of the Korean War Armistice 
Agreement, including potential opportuni-
ties for video reunions for Korean Americans 
with such family members. 
(3) NO ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF APPRO-
PRIATIONS.—No additional amounts are au-
thorized to be appropriated to the Depart-
ment of State to carry out consultations 
under this subsection. 
(c) ADDITIONAL MATTER
IN REPORT.—The 
Secretary of State, acting through the Spe-
cial Envoy on North Korean Human Rights 
Issues, shall include in each report required 
under section 107(d) of the North Korean 
Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7817(d)), 
a description of the consultations described 
in subsection (b) conducted during the year 
preceding the submission of each report re-
quired under such section 107(d). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous materials on H.R. 1771. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by 
thanking Ms. MENG for sponsoring this 
good bill to provide much-needed relief 
to Korean Americans who have been 
separated from their family members, 
many of them for decades now. 
The Korean war tore families apart 
almost 70 years ago, and it is a human-
itarian tragedy that many of them 
have been separated ever since. It is 
long past time for these families to be 
able to reunite. People who lost their 
parents when they were only toddlers 
are now senior citizens with children 
and grandchildren of their own. 
The Divided Families Reunification 
Act requires the Department of State 
to consult with our South Korean al-
lies, and the Korean-American commu-
nity to make more of these reunions 
happen as soon as possible. Anyone 
who has seen footage of these reunions 
can attest to their profound signifi-
cance—they 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
bonds of family cannot be severed by 
wars, by decades, by distance, or by 
government repression. 
This bill also requires the Depart-
ment of State to report to Congress on 
opportunities to facilitate more re-
unions by video connection, which is 
especially important to allow all Ko-
rean Americans, including those who 
might have difficulty with traveling 
long distances, a real opportunity to 
reconnect with their family members. 
An important role in executing this 
humanitarian policy is the Special 
Envoy on North Korean Human Rights 
issues. It is deeply concerning that the 
Trump administration has left this po-
sition vacant for over 2 years, since 
January 2017. Human rights in North 
Korea remains a bipartisan priority for 
this Congress, but if we are going to ef-
fectively advance these policies, we

need to make sure that we have the 
people in place to execute them. 
Mr. Speaker, the Divided Families 
Reunification Act is an excellent, bi-
partisan bill to continue United States’ 
efforts to reunite families torn apart 
by the Korean war. I hope all Members 
will join me in supporting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Divided Families Reunification 
Act 
introduced 
by 
Representative 
MENG. 
The sad legacy of the Korean war is 
with us even today, almost 70 years 
after the Korean Armistice Agreement 
was signed. The Korean Peninsula re-
mains divided between a nation of free 
people and a nation that subjects its 
people to tyranny. 
The Kim regime continues to threat-
en the peace and security of the region 
and of the world. Families remain bro-
ken, from those still fighting to bring 
their loved ones’ remains home, to 
those with family members trapped in 
North Korea. 
Our vibrant Korean-American com-
munity feels this legacy strongly, so I 
commend Congresswoman MENG for her 
bill, which directs the State Depart-
ment to consult with South Korea and 
Korean Americans on opportunities to 
reunite families separated by the DMZ. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time for the pur-
pose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill to 
support the thousands of Korean Amer-
icans whose families were torn apart 
by the Korean war. 
One of the most important tasks car-
ried out by the State Department is 
the reunion of Americans with their 
family members, and this act would 
focus that good work on a group of peo-
ple who have waited decades for that 
chance. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the 
passage of this legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to support the same. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SIRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1771, as 
amended.

HONORING PATRICK HIDALGO 
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today, I would like to take a 
moment to honor a good friend, an in-
credible young man, one of Miami’s 
best, Patrick Hidalgo, who passed away 
last week. 
Words cannot begin to describe the 
brightness that Patrick reflected on 
the world. His smile was infectious; his 
passion for life was palpable; and his 
empathy made everyone feel seen, feel 
heard, and feel valued. 
Patrick accomplished more in his 
lifetime on Earth than many will in 
their entire lives. He was a Belen High 
School 
grad. 
He 
graduated 
from 
Georgetown, Harvard, and MIT. He was 
appointed by the Obama administra-
tion to work in the White House, and 
he was a huge driving force in helping 
normalize relations with Cuba.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1550 
March 9, 2020 
While Patrick could have done any-
thing with his life, he decided to move 
back home to Miami and work to en-
sure that our city became the best 
version of itself, a more equitable, 
more just, more accessible place for all 
Floridians. He recently cofounded the 
Miami Freedom Project to achieve just 
that. 
I know that Patrick has found his 
freedom and his peace. We will honor 
his legacy by working to ensure that 
our city is a more just and freer place. 
Patrick, you touched the lives of so 
many people from so many walks of 
life. You made us better. You chal-
lenged us. You believed in us. We prom-
ise to honor your legacy. 
May you rest in peace, Patrick.

REMEMBERING CINDY WADE 
TANNER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of Mrs. Cindy Wade Tanner. 
From Waycross in Georgia’s First 
Congressional District, she was loved 
and cherished by many. 
Mrs. Tanner was a gifted teacher and 
a pillar in her community. She taught 
at Bacon County High School and later 
moved to Ware County High School. 
After teaching high school students, 
Mrs. Tanner worked at Waycross-Ware 
Technical School and retired in 2017 as 
vice president for institutional ad-
vancement. While there, she planned 
and coordinated the first community- 
wide social fundraiser, the Gala. 
In 1998, Mrs. Tanner was awarded the 
Rick Perkins Award of Excellence, 
which is to honor technical college in-
structors who make significant con-
tributions 
to 
technical 
education 
through innovation and leadership in 
their fields. 
She dedicated most of her time to 
teach and lead others, as she was also 
a beloved Sunday school teacher at her 
church. 
Mrs. Tanner’s selfless legacy will al-
ways be remembered. 
Her family and friends will be in my 
thoughts and prayers during this most 
difficult time.

CONGRATULATING THE ROSELLE 
PARK PANTHERS YOUTH CHEER-
LEADERS 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Roselle Park 
Panthers 
youth 
cheerleaders. 
They 
earned a national championship and a 
bronze medal at the 2019 American 
Youth Cheer, AYC, national champion-
ships. 
The AYC championships are divided 
into more than 20 divisions, from small 
to elite teams. The Roselle Park Pan-
thers won awards in two different divi-
sions. First, a squad of cheerleaders 
aged 10 to 15 years old won the division 
14 small level 3 national championship. 
Then a team of 7- to 10-year-olds 
earned a bronze medal for a third-place 
finish in the division 10 small level 2 
competition. 
This is the second time in 3 years 
that 
Roselle 
Park 
has 
won 
a 
cheerleading 
national 
championship 
and the third time in the squad’s his-
tory. 
Along the way, the Panthers were 
crowned Jersey Shore Champions, Re-
gional Champions, and Regional Grand 
Champions. I am extremely proud of 
these young people and their accom-
plishments, and I look forward to hear-
ing what they will do next. 
They are truly winners, and I am 
proud of Roselle Park, a great part of 
my district.

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR 
MUSIC EDUCATION 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and congratulate Scott Sheehan, a 
music teacher in Hollidaysburg, Penn-
sylvania. Scott was recently elected to 
serve as president of the National Asso-
ciation 
for 
Music 
Education, 
or 
NAfME. 
NAfME is a membership organization 
of more than 60,000 individuals who ad-
vocate for music education at the 
local, State, and national levels. They 
provide resources for teachers, parents, 
and administration who also champion 
music education. 
Scott understands the value music 
adds to a child’s education and a 
child’s life. He said: ‘‘I foresee a future 
where every child can achieve their 
creative musical potential and share 
their 
voice 
and 
place 
in 
society 
through their artistic contributions.’’ 
Scott taught all three of my sons 
music, and I know he will do a great 
job in his new role at NAfME. The tim-
ing of this announcement is particu-
larly appropriate as March is National 
Music in Our Schools Month. 
I would like to thank Scott for his 
commitment to music education over 
the years in teaching and wish him all 
the best of luck. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF 
(Mrs. TORRES of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad that President 
Trump is meeting with his team to fig-
ure out how to save corporate America 
from the economic fallout of the 
coronavirus outbreak. After the worst 
economic collapse in over a decade, I 
would expect nothing less. But a cor-
porate bailout doesn’t help the every-
day workers I represent. 
What about the independent contrac-
tors working two or three jobs just to 
get by? Or the warehouse workers who 
are laid off because China is exporting 
fewer goods to the Port of LA or Long 
Beach? Or the Uber drivers who lose 
business when a convention is canceled 
or are forced to self-quarantine? 
These workers don’t have workplace 
benefits such as paid sick leave. The 
option to self-quarantine isn’t an op-
tion at all when you have to work and 
live every day paycheck to paycheck. 
Mr. President, these are the stories 
of real Americans who are bearing the 
brunt of this crisis, and they deserve 
relief, too. They deserve your atten-
tion, too. I urge you to work with 
Democrats in the House to pass a real 
plan to help all Americans. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
f 
GREAT FEBRUARY JOBS REPORT 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, in the February jobs report, 
job numbers remain strong. Jeff Cox 
with CNBC wrote an article titled: 
‘‘Job Growth Smashes Expectations for 
February 
As 
Unemployment 
Falls 
Back to 3.5 Percent.’’ This title reflects 
the 273,000 jobs created in February, 
smashing the expectation of 175,000 ad-
ditions. 
The article also said: ‘‘The Labor De-
partment reported . . . that the U.S. 
economy added 273,000 new jobs during 
the month, while the unemployment 
rate was 3.5 percent, matching its low-
est level in more than 50 years.’’ 
I am grateful that for African Ameri-
cans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans 
there is record low unemployment with 
record opportunities to achieve jobs. 
President Trump is continuing his 
record of promises made, promises 
kept. This is clear with the release of 
the February report of 273,000 more 
jobs. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

PAID SICK LEAVE 
(Mr. LEVIN of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, as we confront the coronavirus epi-
demic, one thing is clear: Everyone 
should follow the CDC’s recommenda-
tions to stay healthy and safe. That 
means staying home if you are feeling 
sick. 
If we want people to follow that im-
portant guidance, though, we must

March 9, 2020 
make it economically viable to do so. 
That is why I rise today in support of 
critical legislation introduced by Con-
gresswoman DELAURO to ensure that 
working families receive paid sick 
leave in the event of a public health 
emergency like the coronavirus epi-
demic. 
The concept is simple: We want peo-
ple to stay home if they are feeling 
sick 
so 
they 
don’t 
spread 
the 
coronavirus or other illnesses to oth-
ers. But not everyone can afford to do 
that. Many families live paycheck to 
paycheck, struggling to pay their bills 
each month. Taking unpaid sick leave 
simply isn’t an option for them. 
With the severity of the crisis we are 
facing, we cannot force working people 
to choose between going to work and 
spreading their illness to others or 
staying home and getting behind on 
their bills. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support 
Congresswoman 
DELAURO’s 
bill. 
f 
RECOGNIZING JIM PAIVA, 
AGRIBUSINESS OWNER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
tonight to recognize a local farmer and 
agribusiness owner, Jim Paiva from 
west Chico. 
A true Butte County native born in 
Chico, California, Jim grew up on his 
father’s dairy farm and eventually pur-
sued a career in construction for a 
time. However, he eventually left the 
industry and went back to the farm. He 
began planting orchards in the Chico 
area, eventually planting thousands of 
acres of trees. 
He soon saved up enough money to 
buy a piece of land next door to his 
family’s old dairy farm, where he pur-
chased an almond huller. He has since 
diversified into walnuts, prunes, and 
even farm equipment sales. 
Jim is proof of how hard work can 
lead to good outcomes, and his forward 
thinking for that 7-days-a-week work 
has really led to his recent recognition 
as a leader in his field. 
The ‘‘Cec’’ Nielsen award he was just 
awarded this last weekend shows the 
forward thinking he has for sustain-
ability, for having his farm and the 
people at his farm thinking about how 
to do things long term. His commit-
ment 
to 
local 
agriculture 
is 
un-
matched. He serves as a great example 
of entrepreneurial success in Butte 
County. 
Congratulations, Jim Paiva. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
LARRY DURRENCE 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to celebrate the life of a distin-
guished Lakeland, Florida, resident 
and 
former 
mayor, 
the 
Honorable 
Larry 
Durrence. 
Sadly, 
Mayor 
Durrence passed away on February 20. 
Mayor Durrence, or Larry, as he was 
known to many, lived a life dedicated 
to serving others and the community 
that he called home. 
Beyond his two terms in the Lake-
land City Hall, he also served as the 
third president of Polk Community 
College, which is now Polk State Col-
lege. During his tenure, he prioritized 
workforce training and accelerated 
education programs. He was committed 
to equity and diversity, including 
growing minority and female represen-
tation in leadership positions. 
Larry was widely known by his 
friends and those who worked alongside 
him as a dedicated and humble public 
servant who loved interacting with and 
serving people. 
Larry Durrence was a great leader 
and a great friend to our community, 
and his legacy will be felt for years to 
come. 
Thank you, Larry, for your many 
contributions. It is because of men and 
women like you that I remain proud to 
represent and serve Florida’s 15th Con-
gressional District. 
f 
JOSEPH SOMMA’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize the 100th birth-
day of Joseph Somma from North Cape 
May, south Jersey, on March 9. 
Joseph is a World War II combat vet-
eran who served in the Coast Guard 
from 1942 to 1945. He was on the USS 
Charlottesville PF–25 in the Pacific the-
ater. He was awarded numerous and 
prestigious service medals during his 
service. 
Joseph has stayed politically active 
his entire life and has voted in the last 
18 Presidential elections. Every single 
day, Joseph proudly flies his American 
flag off of his deck. 
Joseph, you put the great in the 
Greatest Generation. You have lived a 
life of honor and distinction, and you 
and your family should be proud of all 
of the accomplishments in your amaz-
ing life. 
Some people look to actors, sports 
stars or—heaven forbid—politicians as 
heroes. I look to folks like Joseph for 
inspiration as a true American hero. 
Thank you, and I hope your celebra-
tion with your family and friends 
brings you a tremendous amount of 
joy. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to: 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois (at the 
request of Mr. HOYER) for today. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE (at the request of 
Mr. HOYER) for today on account of of-
ficial work in district. 
Mr. MULLIN (at the request of Mr. 
MCCARTHY) for today and the balance 
of the week on account of supporting 
his son’s continued recovery.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, You answer us when 
we call. You extend to us Your mercies. 
Great is Your faithfulness. Stay close 
to our lawmakers, guiding them in 
these challenging times. 
Lord, inspire them to put their total 
trust in You as they find joy in Your 
abiding presence. Deliver them from 
discouragement as they seek to exalt 
You by the way they live. 
Lord, give them the wisdom to cul-
tivate reverence for You and Your pre-
cepts. 
We pray, in Your sacred Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING MAKE-A-WISH IOWA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
Saturday marked an incredible mile-
stone for Make-a-Wish Iowa. At that 
event in Dubuque, this organization 
granted its 4,000th wish to Michael, age 
15, from Oelwein, IA. He received a 
livestock trailer for transporting his 
show cattle. 
Now, 4,000 wishes is an amazing 
achievement for Make-a-Wish, which is 
dedicated to bringing joy to critically 
ill young people in Iowa. The wishes 
they grant make such an impact on the 
lives of these children. 
I congratulate Make-a-Wish Iowa and 
their many volunteers for their accom-
plishments. I know they will continue 
to spread joy, kindness, and compas-
sion for years to come. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The

OFFICER. 
The

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
coronavirus continues to spread, with 
more than 500 confirmed cases in the 
United States in two-thirds of the 50 
States. Given the inconsistency and 
delay in testing, we don’t know if the 
number of confirmed cases actually re-
flects the number of actual cases in the 
United States. 
We 
now 
know 
that 
when 
the 
coronavirus first appeared on our soil, 
the Centers for Disease Control pro-
duced kits that did not work properly 
and sent many of these tests to our 
hospitals and medical labs. The admin-
istration turned down tests from the 
World 
Health 
Organization, 
even 
though 60 countries accepted them, and 
we have no answer as to why. 
It took weeks to get an accurate test 
out, and then it took weeks for the 
Federal Government to approve certain 
sites to run those tests, like the 
Northwell facility on Long Island that 
I recently visited. It took weeks to 
ramp up the number of Americans test-
ed, and we are still far behind other 
countries like South Korea in the num-
ber and percentage of the population 
we are able to test for coronavirus. 
The most powerful tool in responding 
to a virus is to know precisely where it 
is and how it is spreading, but because 
we don’t have a complete handle on 
testing, many of our hospitals, doctors, 
researchers, and public health officials

S1616 
March 9, 2020 
are flying blind, and we are still far be-
hind where we ought to be in under-
standing how far the virus has already 
spread. 
Now, instead of taking responsibility 
and working quickly to rectify the 
early errors, the Trump administra-
tion—and, especially, the President 
himself—downplayed concerns about 
the virus. The President falsely said a 
vaccine would be ready soon and im-
plied that it was OK for Americans to 
go to work even if they had the virus. 
The 
President 
falsely 
blamed 
the 
Obama administration for a policy 
change that slowed testing. What he 
said was regarded as totally false. 
Rather than spend the weekend in 
Washington to get a grip on the crisis, 
the President was once again golfing at 
Mar-a-Lago. I don’t want to guess at 
the number of times this President has 
criticized other Presidents for doing 
the same thing. The Federal Govern-
ment’s 
initial 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus was slipshod at best. It has 
greatly hurt the country, and it falls at 
the feet of the President. The buck 
stops with him. 
Now, I know President Trump will 
dismiss these criticisms and accuse 
Democrats of playing politics. That is 
what he always does when there is le-
gitimate criticism, because in Presi-
dent Trump’s world, there is no such 
thing as a legitimate criticism of his 
administration. But I would tell Presi-
dent Trump: We don’t criticize your ad-
ministration for the sake of it. We 
criticize because we want the adminis-
tration’s response to get better, and we 
are afraid that if we don’t speak up, if 
we don’t point out the problems pub-
licly and push the administration to 
change its method of operation, it will 
not change at all, and the crisis will 
continue to worsen. 
Now more than ever, we need Presi-
dent Trump to lead our government’s 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus 
com-
petently and consistently. We are all 
rooting for that. 
As 
the 
economic 
effects 
of 
the 
coronavirus are beginning to worsen, 
there have been rumors that the 
Trump 
administration 
may 
pursue 
policies to stimulate the economy. Let 
me be very clear. The best way to en-
sure economic security for the Amer-
ican people right now is to deal with 
the coronavirus itself competently and 
full on—something we haven’t yet 
seen. Getting a handle on the crisis and 
containing the spread of the virus is by 
far the best way to address any effects 
on the economy. If anything, the ad-
ministration must prioritize the health 
and safety of American workers and 
families certainly before corporate in-
terests. 
In 
that 
respect, 
Speaker 
PELOSI and I have suggested several 
policies that the administration should 
pursue to help American workers and 
families: paid sick leave for workers 
impacted by quarantine orders or re-
sponsible for caring for children im-
pacted by school closures; enhanced 
unemployment insurance for workers 
who may lose their jobs from the eco-
nomic impacts of the epidemic; food se-
curity to ensure vulnerable populations 
do not lose access to food during this 
epidemic; clear protections for front-
line workers, like our healthcare pro-
fessionals and workers who are respon-
sible for cleaning public facilities; 
widespread and free coronavirus test-
ing, as well as affordable treatment for 
any 
noncovered 
coronavirus-related 
costs; 
protections 
against 
price 
gouging; and increased capacity of our 
medical systems. 
The 
administration 
must 
move 
quickly and seriously to address the 
expanding threat to the health of the 
American people and the severe im-
pacts of the coronavirus on the finan-
cial security of American families. 
Again, the best way to deal with the 
problem here—health and economic—is 
to address the problem head-on and 
deal with the kinds of problems we 
have seen in the administration in its 
slipshod and erratic response. That 
must vanish. 
S. 2657 
Mr. President, now on the Energy 
bill, this week the Senate will continue 
to work on a bill that would update our 
Nation’s energy policy. Since the bill 
has been taken up, Senators have filed 
hundreds of amendments, and I hope 
we can have a fair process that will 
allow the Senate to consider amend-
ments from both sides of the aisle. 
I voted yes on the motion to proceed 
to the Energy bill because I was hope-
ful we would have a fair and robust 
amendment 
process. 
Unfortunately, 
this has not happened. The majority 
leader is rushing to conclude the bill, 
even though there is no particular ur-
gency to finish this week. I salute 
Leader MANCHIN, who has worked very 
hard on this bill, as well as Chair MUR-
KOWSKI. I have differences with the bill, 
but they worked hard in a bipartisan 
way. 
But we also have an emergency that 
warrants legislative action as soon as 
possible, and that is climate change. At 
the moment, Leader MCCONNELL
is 
blocking 
an 
important 
bipartisan 
amendment that would help clear it. I 
have urged Leader MCCONNELL to allow 
a vote on an amendment led by Sen-
ator CARPER, a Democrat, and Senator 
KENNEDY, a Republican, that would re-
quire the EPA to phase out the use of 
HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons. HFCs are 
dangerous greenhouse chemicals found 
in 
everyday 
appliances—air 
condi-
tioners, refrigerators, and the like. 
They are thousands of times more dam-
aging to our atmosphere than carbon 
dioxide. Phasing out these HFCs is 
very important, and it will go a long 
way in fighting climate change and 
protecting the environment for future 
generations. 
I believe the Senate should be al-
lowed to vote on the Carper-Kennedy 
amendment. A bipartisan group of Sen-
ators back it, and even the chamber of 
commerce backs this amendment. So 
far, Leader MCCONNELL has not allowed 
a vote on it. 
Now, we don’t have a caucus posi-
tion. There are different views because 
of the good work done by Senator SHA-
HEEN and Senator MANCHIN on other 
parts of the bill, but I will be voting no 
on cloture this evening unless we can 
work out a compromise in the next few 
hours to get a vote on this critical 
amendment. 
The Energy bill is a rare opportunity 
to make tangible progress on climate 
change as well—an existential threat 
to our planet. I hope my Republican 
colleagues and Leader MCCONNELL, in 
particular, see the better side of reason 
and allow us to vote on bipartisan 
amendments. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 
coronavirus has now been confirmed in 
104 countries. There are more than 
110,000 cases worldwide, and nearly 
4,000 people have died. In the United 
States, we have more than 500 cases— 
including 7 in my home State of Illi-
nois—and at least 20 deaths. With these 
numbers expected to increase, we must 
be prepared to handle the cases that in-
evitably will follow. 
As we consider the next step, it is im-
perative that we look at the impact 
this public health emergency is having 
in all sectors of our economy, including 
schools, hospitals, nursing homes, pub-
lic health departments, and small busi-
nesses. Last Friday, I held a roundtable 
discussion with officials from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
and the Illinois and Chicago Depart-
ments of Public Health, as well as 
other local health officials. It was held 
in the medical district in the city of 
Chicago. Experts updated us with the 
latest information on the coronavirus 
and what is being done at the State 
and local levels to prevent and address 
the outbreak. I am grateful for the 
work these officials are doing to keep 
Illinois safe and healthy in our homes, 
schools, and communities. 
This is a serious public health chal-
lenge, and we are working diligently to 
protect Americans from the virus. The 
seriousness of this situation was evi-
dent by how quickly the House and 
Senate here in Washington came to-
gether on a bipartisan basis to provide 
needed emergency funding to help com-
bat the virus. Last week, Congress re-
jected President Trump’s original fund-
ing request of $2.5 billion and, instead, 
we secured $7.8 billion to address the 
virus in the United States. This fund-
ing will reimburse State and local gov-
ernments for the millions of dollars 
they have already spent in containing 
the spread of this virus. 
The bill also included important 
measures for patient monitoring, lab 
testing, acquisition of test kits, protec-
tive equipment, and research for vac-
cine and therapeutics. Democrats suc-
cessfully fought to include a provision 
in the bill that will hopefully ensure

that any forthcoming coronavirus vac-
cine is accessible and affordable for all 
Americans in need. 
As we look forward to the next steps 
to respond to this public health emer-
gency, it is critical that Congress 
prioritize the health and safety of 
workers and their families. Our public 
health experts are rightfully telling 
people to stay home if they are sick. 
Yet for many Americans, staying home 
means losing a paycheck that helps 
them pay their rent, pay for food, 
medication, and childcare. For many 
American families, losing a paycheck— 
even one—would be devastating. Nearly 
40 percent of American adults do not 
have enough savings to cover a $400 
emergency expense. I am proud to have 
helped introduce legislation last week 
that would immediately provide 14 
days of paid sick leave to workers in 
light of coronavirus. It also is impor-
tant that we ensure workers have ac-
cess to unemployment insurance bene-
fits during this uncertain time. 
We passed a robust funding bill last 
week, but our work is far from done. 
There will be far-reaching impacts of 
this outbreak. It is imperative that we 
look forward to developing a com-
prehensive response that benefits ev-
eryone, including America’s working 
families and small businesses, not just 
large corporations. 
It is also important that we recog-
nize the good work being done around 
the country to combat this virus. The 
Argonne National Laboratory in my 
State of Illinois is helping to address 
the threat with the Advanced Photon 
Source. Researchers are using this 
high-powered x ray to study the virus. 
In fact, it was just announced last 
week that potential drug targets have 
been identified for this coronavirus by 
a team, including the University of 
Chicago, Northwestern University, and 
the University of California, Riverside. 
The scientists said their findings sug-
gest drugs previously in development 
to treat SARS could now be developed 
as 
an 
effective 
drug 
against 
this 
coronavirus outbreak. This work by 
Argonne highlights how we need to 
work with researchers from different 
subject areas and expertise to address 
this pandemic and the importance of 
supporting scientific research funding 
in places like the National Institutes of 
Health. 
It is coincidental that the Presiding 
Officer, the Senator from Missouri, and 
I have worked together with Senator 
ALEXANDER of Tennessee and Senator 
MURRAY of Washington over the last 
several years to consistently increase, 
year after year, the amount of money 
we invest in the National Institutes of 
Health, our premier medical research 
laboratory in the world. 
If I am not mistaken, over this period 
of time—a matter of only 4 years—we 
have increased the expenditures for the 
National Institutes of Health from $30 
billion to more than $39 billion—a more 
than 5-percent-added increase over in-
flation every single year. During the 
same period, I believe the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention has in-
creased by about 16 percent, which is a 
good number but not good enough. If 
anything, this pandemic that we face 
has reminded us of the absolutely es-
sential role that is played by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
in protecting American families from 
the threat of disease and the epidemic 
that we now may face with the 
coronavirus. We need to make this in-
vestment every year, without fail, in 
our medical research and medical pre-
vention efforts in the United States. 
I commend the Senator from Mis-
souri, who is presiding, for his leader-
ship on this issue, and I want to con-
tinue to work with him on a bipartisan 
basis to make sure this is done. 
Discoveries like those at the Argonne 
National Laboratory are fighting to 
give us a reason to increase the funding 
as well in our basic Laboratories across 
the board. The Office of Science in the 
Department of Energy is a very critical 
partner to our medical research efforts, 
and we are learning that today as we 
face the coronavirus threat. We have 
successfully increased this funding at 
the Laboratory since fiscal year 2016. I 
am going to continue to work for more 
increases in the future, and I hope my 
colleagues will join me on a bipartisan 
basis. 
It is important that we all remember 
to follow everyday precautions and 
educate ourselves with the CDC’s pre-
vention guidelines. I have probably 
washed my hands more this last week-
end than during any weekend of my 
life, but I believe now this has to be 
routine and normal for all of us to de-
fault to washing our hands as fre-
quently as possible and to do it in a 
very serious and not haphazard way. 
Avoiding close contact with those who 
are sick, staying home when you are 
sick, covering your nose and mouth, 
and cleaning your hands often are the 
basics that even the most accomplished 
of physicians tell us must be followed 
by everyone. 
Now that we have secured funding to 
help address the coronavirus in an even 
more serious way in this country, we 
must look to this outbreak and how it 
will affect our daily lives and our econ-
omy. We have to look at the issues of 
paid sick leave for American workers, 
enhanced 
unemployment 
insurance, 
transportation, 
food 
security, 
edu-
cational plans, affordable treatment, 
and widespread and free coronavirus 
testing. We know we are probably a 
year to a year and a half away from the 
development of a vaccine, but that 
doesn’t mean we shouldn’t redouble our 
efforts now to do it and to do it in the 
right way. 
The health and safety of all Ameri-
cans is the highest priority of our U.S. 
Congress and our government. I stand 
ready to work with my colleagues to 
provide the Federal resources that are 
necessary to support and assist us in 
our progress against this threatening 
virus. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee is recognized. 
TENNESSEE TORNADOES 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on 
Friday, I flew with President Trump to 
Tennessee to visit with the Ten-
nesseans who were hurt by the torna-
does last week. 
There were four tornadoes. They hit 
primarily Benton, Davidson, Wilson, 
and Putnam Counties. They left 24 
dead, and about 150 injured. There were 
more than 1,500 structures that were 
damaged. The winds were up to 175 
miles per hour in the tornado that 
reached Putnam County. 
We visited western Putnam County 
not far from Baxter. I talked to Matt 
and Angela Struggs there. She told me 
that at about 2 a.m., I guess it was 
early Wednesday morning, she heard 
what sounded like a freight train and 
then a whistle. All the people I talked 
with heard a freight train and a whis-
tle. 
She said—of course, they were all 
asleep, as it was 2 a.m. in the morning, 
and they didn’t have any warning. So 
she ran upstairs as the windows were 
being blown out of the house, grabbed 
her youngest child, and came down-
stairs where her other two children and 
her husband were, and the sound was 
gone. They opened the door and looked 
across the street, and her son said: 
‘‘It’s gone.’’ What was gone were all 
the homes, all the neighbors. Eight 
died in that neighborhood alone. 
The first heroes of this tragedy were 
those neighbors and other neighbors in 
Nashville, and Benton County, and 
Mount Juliet in Wilson County. Matt 
Struggs, the husband of the young 
woman I was talking with, is a worship 
leader in their church. This was obvi-
ously a very close-knit community. He 
said: We knew who was left by the 
sounds of their voices. So we set about 
finding them and digging them out and 
getting them to the hospital. 
This is certainly not what anyone 
would describe as an area of rich Amer-
icans, but they would not want to be 
described either as middle-income or 
low-income Americans, either. They 
are what I would call ‘‘salt of the 
earth’’ people, really good people—a 
very close-knit community whose first 
reaction and whose reaction the day we 
were there, 3 days later, was how can 
we help each other. 
After the neighbors, the next heroes 
were the first responders. We met with 
many of them in Cookeville. Next were 
the volunteers. They turned out by the 
hundreds. Rick Gilbert, who is disaster 
coordinator for the Church of Christ in 
downtown Cookeville, talked with me 
about what they had there, but he 
didn’t have to tell me. I could see it. 
There were stockpiles of boxes with ev-
erything 
imaginable 
that 
someone 
would want. Whatever they need, is 
what we try to give people who come 
here. 
These Tennesseans were grateful for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1618 
March 9, 2020 
more than the fact that this was the 
first time any President of the United 
States had visited Cookeville, TN. This 
is an important town, but it is a town 
between Nashville and Knoxville about 
nearly halfway, and Presidents come to 
Nashville or Knoxville or Memphis or 
Chattanooga or our bigger cities when 
they come to Tennessee. But not only 
did the President go to Cookeville— 
that 
was 
a 
40-minute 
helicopter 
flight—he drove another 30 or 40 min-
utes to this neighborhood where the 
Struggs and their neighbors live—the 
ones who opened the door and looked 
across the street and saw that every-
thing was gone. The President stayed, 
and he talked for a long time. He lis-
tened, and they appreciated it very 
much. 
He and the other Federal officials an-
nounced a major disaster declaration 
in, what I believe to be record time. So 
by the time we were there on Friday, 
there were 75 Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency personnel on the 
ground in Tennessee, and there were 
three shelters already open. 
I just talked with Congressman JIM 
COOPER from Nashville who has been 
deeply involved with this since the be-
ginning, and he talked about the shel-
ters being opened and the devastation 
at the Tennessee State University’s 
Agriculture Center there in Nashville. 
Governor Lee and his wife Maria 
were there, and he did, as usual, a re-
markably good job. He, like the Presi-
dent, has an easy way of dealing with 
people. Congressman JOHN ROSE was 
there. His hometown is Cookeville, the 
community where we were visiting. 
Senator BLACKBURN was there. She had 
gone 
with 
Congressman 
ROSE
on 
Wednesday and Thursday as soon as 
she heard about it. So she went back 
on Friday with us. 
Of course, the mayors of all those 
communities hadn’t gotten much sleep 
since Tuesday night when the tragedy 
occurred. They know—and the Presi-
dent and the Governor and I and Sen-
ator BLACKBURN, we all said to them: 
We know we can’t resolve this. We 
can’t make things like they used to be. 
We know we can’t give you all the help 
you need, but we are here. That is real-
ly all they expected or all they wanted. 
This is not our first tornado in Ten-
nessee. According to The Tennessean 
newspaper, we have had 18 in the last 25 
years, and several of them have been 
strong tornadoes like this one. But the 
people of Tennessee would want me to 
express our heartfelt appreciation to 
the President and to the Federal offi-
cials who, in the midst of everything 
else they had to do, jumped on this 
tragedy immediately, got the declara-
tion out quickly, had the FEMA per-
sonnel on site, and had the shelters 
opened in what seemed to me to be a 
record amount of time. They then 
joined with the Tennessee volunteers 
and the neighbors and the first re-
sponders who set out to help the Ten-
nesseans who were hurt. 
There was a beautiful article written 
this morning that appeared in the New 
York Times by Margaret Renkl from 
Nashville 
about 
the 
meaning 
of 
hashtag ‘‘NashvilleStrong,’’ in which 
she talks about in her last sentence 
that ‘‘while we understand we have not 
been singled out by God for survival, 
we also understand that we can be 
God’s hands here in the rubble, helping 
our neighbors dig out.’’ 
That is what is happening in Ten-
nessee, and the President, the Federal 
officials, and the others who went to 
help, we greatly appreciate what they 
did, and I wanted to come to the floor 
to say that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
Nation is continuing to confront the 
public health challenge posed by the 
new coronavirus. Right now, as Dr. An-
thony Fauci of the National Institutes 
of Health reminds us, the risk that any 
individual American will contract the 
disease remains low. This is not a time 
for fear. It is a time to continue calmly 
scaling up serious and smart prepara-
tions that have already been underway 
so the United States can continue 
working to blunt, slow, and mitigate 
the spread within our borders. 
The most recent global health secu-
rity index rated the United States the 
No. 1 overall most prepared country in 
the world for an infectious disease out-
break—the No. 1 overall most prepared 
country in the world for an infectious 
disease outbreak. Our resources, capa-
bilities, and expertise are the envy of 
the rest of the world. 
In this instance, the President’s 
early, bold actions to impose travel re-
strictions and quarantine measures 
back in January bought our Nation 
more time and more room to continue 
preparing. 
With that said, there was never any 
illusion that our country of more than 
300 million people and nearly 4 million 
square miles could be entirely sealed 
off from the rest of the world. The 
question was never if we would have to 
combat the coronavirus here on U.S. 
soil, but when and to what degree. 
As Dr. Fauci noted yesterday, we are 
now seeing instances of community 
spread here in the United States, and 
the CDC has now confirmed nearly 500 
cases on U.S. soil. With respect to indi-
vidual best practices and precautions, 
all Americans should follow the rec-
ommendations of the CDC and their 
State and local authorities. Detailed 
suggestions for different personal situ-
ations 
are 
available 
online 
at 
www.cdc.gov. 
Officials in my home State of Ken-
tucky are currently monitoring four 
confirmed cases. I spoke to the Gov-
ernor this morning and will continue 
to stay in close touch to make sure 
that Kentucky and all 50 States have 
what they need and know Congress has 
their back. 
Last week, the Senate passed nearly 
$8 billion in supplemental funding, 
which President Trump signed into 
law. It will deliver surge resources to 
national public health experts, front-
line healthcare professionals, and State 
and local governments as they work to-
gether to protect Americans. That leg-
islation ensured a funding floor of at 
least $7 million will go to Kentucky to 
help fight the virus. 
In addition, I want to recognize and 
thank our colleague, the junior Sen-
ator from Texas. Ten days ago, he 
briefly interacted with an individual 
who has since tested positive for the 
virus. Even though he feels fine and it 
has already been 10 days, after con-
sulting with experts, Senator CRUZ 
elected to work from home this week 
out of an abundance of caution. We will 
certainly miss our colleague around 
the Capitol this week, but I want to 
commend him for taking the initiative. 
We had a chance to talk yesterday. 
So here is the bottom line: Our great 
Nation is very strong. We have enor-
mous expertise and tremendous capa-
bilities, and Congress, on a bipartisan 
basis, has made sure our health experts 
and leaders have the funding they need. 
With calm and competence, all Amer-
icans—all of them—should continue to 
listen to the experts, take their advice, 
and take commonsense steps to protect 
ourselves, our families, and our com-
munities. 
S. 2657 
Mr. President, now, on another mat-
ter here on the Senate floor, we will 
pick up where we left off last week: 
considering a comprehensive set of up-
dates to the way our Nation ap-
proaches energy efficiency, security, 
and innovation. 
As Chairman MURKOWSKI pointed out 
last week, it has been about 12 years 
since the last such package, and since 
then, America’s energy sector has un-
dergone some real changes. New tech-
nology has opened new doors for energy 
production and also presented new 
threats to our electrical grid and other 
critical infrastructure. 
Even at a time when a strong job 
market has continued to bring Ameri-
cans off the sidelines, the domestic en-
ergy sector has outpaced the economy 
as a whole in job creation. Increased 
access to our abundant domestic re-
serves has unleashed American energy 
on the international market. In fact, 
the Department of Energy has pre-
dicted the United States will become a 
net exporter of energy this year for the 
first time since 1953. 
Over the past 12 years, we have seen 
plenty of attempts to intervene in this

evolution of the American energy sec-
tor. Under the last administration, we 
saw an anti-domestic energy mindset 
that manifested in proposals like the 
so-called 
Clean 
Power 
Plan. 
That 
would have buried domestic energy in a 
tangle of stifling redtape and would 
have jeopardized more than 100,000 
American jobs. The working families I 
represent 
in 
Kentucky 
faced 
that 
threat head-on. 
Even more recently, we saw Demo-
cratic Party standard bearers roll out a 
far-left proposal that would ban afford-
able forms of domestic power and let 
Washington micromanage everything 
from American jobs to their cars to 
their homes. We saw only a small num-
ber of our Senate Democratic col-
leagues able to vote against this rad-
ical proposal. That is the wrong way to 
think about American energy domi-
nance. 
Fortunately, thanks to the dedicated 
work of our colleagues on the Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, the 
bipartisan bill before us is the right 
way to go about it. The legislation be-
fore us includes provisions and input 
from nearly three-fourths of this body. 
From grid security and workforce 
training to energy storage and carbon 
capture, the Senate has a chance to 
pass a number of important updates to 
energy policy on a wide bipartisan 
basis. 
I hope and anticipate the Senate will 
be able to process amendments and 
then pass the American Energy Innova-
tion Act this week. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The

REMEMBERING JOHN ROBERT 
MILLER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it is 
my honor today to pay tribute to a 
brave Kentucky veteran who passed 
away last month at the age of 96. John 
Robert Miller, of Glasgow, KY, led a re-
markable life of generous service and 
lasting achievement. As a member of 
the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ John Rob-
ert defended our Nation and its ideals 
before coming home to raise a family 
and lead his community. 
Like many brave Kentuckians, John 
Robert volunteered to serve our coun-
try during the Second World War. Over 
the coming years in the Army Artil-
lery, he achieved the rank of technical 
sergeant and was stationed for 3 years 
in the South Pacific. For the rest of his 
life, his pride in our Nation and his 
military service were well known to 
all. 
John Robert returned to Barren 
County after the war and married 
Christine 
McGuire, 
his 
inseparable 
partner for the next 67 years. Together 
they built a proud life. He turned to ag-
riculture, owning a dairy farm while 
also growing several crops and raising 
angus cattle. His love for the land in-
spired John Robert to share his knowl-
edge with the next generation of Ken-
tucky farmers through 4–H. An active 
mentor and guide, he was elected State 
chairman of the Kentucky 4–H Leader-
ship Council. 
John Robert seemed to be constantly 
thinking of how he could help others. 
In addition to his farm and a small 
business he owned, he was elected to 
the Barren County Fiscal Court. With 
the strong support of those he served, 
John Robert was twice reelected. As a 
local election commissioner for more 
than two decades, he also earned admi-
ration and the lasting gratitude of his 
community. 
He 
received 
multiple 
awards in recognition of his life of 
service for others, including the Barren 
County Patriot Award. 
I would like to share my heartfelt 
condolences with John Robert’s chil-
dren, Johnny, Lanny, and Donnie. 
Their father, John Robert, contributed 
to our Commonwealth’s bright future. 
Through his hard work, his faith, and 
his refusal to quit, he left behind a leg-
acy to be proud of. I urge my Senate 
colleagues to join me in honoring a 
treasured Kentuckian, John Robert 
Miller. 
f 
WOMEN POLITICAL PRISONERS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, on 
International Women’s Day, we cele-
brated women and girls around the 
globe for their tremendous contribu-
tions to our communities, our coun-
tries, and the world. From Albania to 
Zimbabwe, women face enormous risks 
to pursue progress in defiance of atti-
tudes, policies, and actions that treat 
them as second-class citizens. Too 
often, these women are punished for 
their courage. As this year marks the 
25th anniversary of the United Nations’ 
adoption of the Beijing Declaration on 
the equal rights of women, we reaffirm 
our commitment to achieving women’s 
empowerment 
and 
equal 
status 
throughout the world. 
Today, I want to highlight 25 women 
who have risked their lives, withstood 
torture, and been unjustly detained for 
fighting for human rights, democracy, 
a free and fair press, and the rights of 
vulnerable LGBT populations, as well 
as safeguarding their culture and the 
environment. The repressive responses 
of their respective governments speaks 
to the power these women command, 
the implications of their cause, and the 
movements they inspire. 
In Russia, President Putin’s govern-
ment utilizes politically motivated im-
prisonment to bolster its power by 
cracking down on journalists, human 
rights advocates, religious minorities, 
Ukrainian citizens, and civil society 
advocates. Yulia Tsetkova is the latest 
target of the authorities’ long-running 
campaign 
against 
LGBT 
activists. 
Tsetkova has been placed on house ar-
rest and faces years of imprisonment 
for her creative work at a youth ama-
teur theater which the state has la-
beled ‘‘homosexual propaganda,’’ for 
drawings described as criminal ‘‘por-
nography’’ and for administrating two 
LGBT-themed groups on social media 
deemed’’ gay propaganda.’) 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
waged a powerful campaign to suppress 
vibrant ethnic minority communities 
and political dissent. The government 
has brutally cracked down in Xinjiang, 
where it has extrajudicially interned 
and subjected more than 1 million 
Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to 
forced labor, torture, and abuse. Rahile 
Dawut, a Xinjiang University professor 
who researched and documented tradi-
tional Uyghur culture, disappeared in 
December 2017. Sanubar Tursun, a re-
nowned Uyghur singer, disappeared in 
November 2018, shortly before she was 
scheduled to perform in France. We 
will not forget their names nor their 
work. 
The Chinese Communist party has 
also targeted Tibetans for celebrating 
their heritage. In late 2015, officials de-
tained at least eight Tibetans accused 
of organizing observances of the Dalai 
Lama’s 80th birthday. Those detained 
included Bonkho Kyi, who had orga-
nized a public picnic to celebrate the 
occasion. Kyi was sentenced to 7 years’ 
imprisonment, although details of the 
criminal charges remain unavailable. 
In Iran, human rights defenders have 
been steadfast in their advocacy de-
spite repeated arrest and abuse by au-
thorities. Nasrin Sotoudeh has devoted 
her life to advocating for human rights 
in Iran, speaking out against the death 
penalty and laws forcing women to 
wear hijabs. Sotoudeh was rearrested 
in June 2018 for defending women 
protestors against the forced hijab and 
faces 38 years in prison and 148 lashes. 
Atena Daemi, also a lifelong human 
rights activist, is serving a 7-year pris-
on sentence for handing out anti-death 
penalty leaflets. She has been on hun-
ger strike twice and is in dire need of 
medical attention due to dizziness and 
numbness. Narges Mohammadi, vice 
president of the Centre for Human 
Rights Defenders in Iran, has been im-
prisoned since May 2015 and is serving 
a 16-year sentence. Mohammadi is 
critically ill with pulmonary embolism 
and a neurological disorder resulting in 
seizures and temporary partial paral-
ysis. 
Iranian authorities have also re-
cently arrested and imprisoned envi-
ronmentalists. 
Niloufar 
Bayani, 
a 
McGill 
University-graduate, 
worked

She was arrested along with several co-
workers, including Sepideh Kashami, 
on charges of espionage. Multiple gov-
ernment bodies have found no evidence 
suggesting the environmentalists de-
tained were spies. While detained, 
Bayani has reportedly suffered from 
torture and threats of sexual assault. 
Governments around the world are 
also attacking the free press and tar-
geting journalists, particularly those 
who speak truth to power and expose 
the failures of those very governments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1621 
March 9, 2020 
Many women journalists have been tar-
geted and unjustly detained. In par-
ticular, the escalating use of criminal 
charges of ‘‘false news’’ or ‘‘fake news’’ 
to imprison journalists and activists is 
alarming. Certainly, these incitements 
of ‘‘fake news’’ echo President Trump 
and 
his 
administration’s regressive 
rhetoric and attacks on the press and 
democratic values. 
As of December 2019, Turkey was the 
world’s second worst jailer of journal-
ists with 47 in prison, coming in close 
second to China with 48. President 
Erdogan has cracked down on inde-
pendent criticism by shuttering more 
than 100 news outlets and jailing doz-
ens 
of 
journalists. 
Editor 
Hatice 
Duman was imprisoned in 2003 and is 
serving a life sentence based on charges 
of propaganda and being a member of a 
banned group. Duman was the owner 
and news editor of the socialist weekly 
‘‘Atilim,’’ which had opposed President 
Erdogan’s policies. She was convicted 
based on authorities’ claim of her at-
tendance at a Marxist-Leninist Com-
munist Party demonstration and the 
testimony of confidential witnesses. 
Duman’s husband later said the police 
threatened sexual violence against his 
family if he did not testify against his 
wife. Aysenur Parildak and Hanim 
Bu¨ sra 
Erdal, 
two 
journalists 
for 
‘‘Zaman,’’ are both serving sentences 
for terrorism-related offenses based on 
claims that ‘‘Zaman’’ had ties to 
Fethulaah Gu¨ len. Sadiye Eser, a re-
porter 
for 
the 
pro-Kurdish 
‘‘Mezopotamya News Agency,’’ has also 
been detained by police since Novem-
ber 
2019 
on 
politically 
motivated 
charges of membership of a terrorist 
organization. 
In Egypt, President Sisi has at-
tempted to quash dissent and consoli-
date control by wrongfully imprisoning 
human rights defenders. Mahienour el- 
Masry, a human rights lawyer, has 
spent her career organizing peaceful 
protests, advocating for political pris-
oners, and denouncing human rights 
violations. She was arrested in Sep-
tember 2019 following a wave of pro-
tests calling for President Sisi’s res-
ignation and charged with collabo-
rating with a terrorist organization, 
spreading ‘‘false news,’’ and using so-
cial media to publish false rumors. 
Esraa Abdel Fattah, a human rights 
activist and reporter for the banned 
‘‘Tahrir 
News,’’ 
was 
arrested 
on 
charges of spreading ‘‘false news,’’ 
membership in a banned group, and 
abuse of social media networks in Oc-
tober 2019. Abdel Fattah was reportedly 
beaten, hung from handcuffs for hours, 
and choked with her clothes while in-
terrogated. 
In Burundi, authorities have cracked 
down on free expression in anticipation 
of the country’s 2020 elections. Chris-
tine Kamikazi and Agnes Ndirubusa, 
journalists at Burundi’s last remaining 
independent newspaper ‘‘Iwacu,’’ were 
arrested and convicted on charges of 
attempting threat against state secu-
rity by collaborating with the rebel 
group 
RED-Tabara. 
Kamikazi 
and 
Ndirubusa were traveling with two col-
leagues to report on in-fighting be-
tween Burundian security forces and 
RED-Tabara when they were arrested. 
They were convicted despite the fact 
that ‘‘Iwacu’’ had informed authorities 
of their plan to travel to the area for 
reporting and the fact that the RED- 
Tabara attack had already occurred be-
fore their travels to the region. 
Finally, a year ago today, I high-
lighted 14 women political prisoners in 
a statement marking International 
Women’s Day. Of those 14, 8 remain in 
detention today. These include Saudi 
women’s rights and human rights ac-
tivists Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassima 
al-Sada, 
Samar 
Badawi, 
Nouf 
Abdulaziz, and Maya’a al-Zahrani; Sen-
ator Leila de Lima, detained for her 
criticism of extrajudicial killings in 
the 
Philippines; 
Guligeina 
Tashimaimaiti, a Uyghur PhD student 
detained 
in 
China; 
and 
Aster 
Fissehatsion, a political dissident held 
incommunicado without charge nor 
trial since 2001 in Eritrea. 
In Egypt, Russia, China, Iran, Tur-
key, Burundi, Saudi Arabia, the Phil-
ippines, and Eritrea, these women 
threatened by a repressive government, 
abusive authorities, and critical risks 
to their health are advocating for the 
betterment of their entire commu-
nities. Sadly, these 25 women high-
lighted today only represent a small 
fraction of countless women and girls 
unjustly detained and imprisoned. 
On this International Women’s Day, 
we reflect on the remarkable achieve-
ments of women and the work that re-
mains to be done by all of us to reach 
gender parity. The women political 
prisoners we have highlighted today 
serve 
as 
role 
models 
championing 
human rights, democracy, cultural tol-
erance, and environmental preserva-
tion. Their detention should embolden 
the rest of us to take up their causes in 
their absence. I call on governments 
unjustly detaining women for exer-
cising their fundamental rights to im-
mediately release these political pris-
oners. We will not forget these women, 
what they have fought for, and what 
they have sacrificed for all of us as a 
result. 
f 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, on 
January 28, 2020, I submitted a state-
ment for the RECORD on H. Con. Res. 83, 
which directs the President to termi-
nate the use of U.S. Armed Forces to 
engage in hostilities against Iran. 
H. Con. Res. 83 was passed by the 
House of Representatives on January 9, 
2020, and received in the Senate and re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations on January 13, 2020. Pursuant 
to 50 U.S.C. 1546(c), H. Con. Res. 83 
should have been treated as a privi-
leged resolution and reported out of 
the committee on January 28. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee majority leadership opted not 
to hold a committee debate or vote on 
H. Con. Res. 83. As I explained in my 
statement of January 28, I understand 
that this decision was based primarily 
on the view that a concurrent resolu-
tion, under the War Powers Resolution, 
may be privileged only if it uses the 
word ‘‘remove’’ or the phrase ‘‘removal 
of United States Armed Forces engaged 
in hostilities,’’ rather than ‘‘termi-
nate’’ or ‘‘terminate the use of United 
States Armed Forces to engage in hos-
tilities,’’ as used in H. Con. Res. 83. As 
I will explain, however, this view is not 
consistent with Senate precedent. 
On February 13, 2020, the Senate 
passed S.J. Res. 68. This resolution 
contains identical operative language 
to H. Con. Res. 83, directing the Presi-
dent to ‘‘terminate’’ the use of U.S. 
Armed Forces for hostilities against 
Iran. The very fact that S.J. Res. 68 
was considered in the Senate on a priv-
ileged and expedited basis clarified 
that there are no magic words required 
for privilege under the War Powers 
Resolution, and that the use of ‘‘termi-
nate’’ qualifies for such privilege. As a 
result, it is clear that H. Con. Res. 83 
should have been accorded privileged 
status and, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 
1546(c), should have been reported out 
of committee and put up for a Senate 
vote. 
Fortunately, the Senate prerogatives 
under the War Powers Resolution were 
vindicated by the debate, privileged 
consideration, and vote on S.J. Res. 68. 
As such and in light of the identical 
purpose and operative texts of the Sen-
ate joint resolution and the House con-
current resolution, there is no need at 
this point for a second, identical debate 
to occur either in the committee or on 
the Senate floor. In other words, inac-
tion on H. Con. Res. 83 is harmless. 
Both Chambers of Congress have 
made their views and the views of the 
American people with regard to U.S. 
hostilities against Iran quite clear. I 
hope President Trump and his national 
security staff abide by this message. 
f 
BICENTENNIAL OF MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on 
March 15, 1820, Maine became our Na-
tion’s 23rd State. It is a pleasure to 
join my fellow Mainers in celebrating 
this bicentennial and the generations 
of people who have written an inspiring 
and remarkable history. 
The story of Maine begins long before 
President James Monroe signed the 
legislation granting statehood to what 
had been a district of Massachusetts. 
For thousands of years, the land has 
been home to the Wabanaki, who have 
drawn sustenance from Maine’s woods 
and waters. The People of the Dawn re-
main valued members of our commu-
nities today, and their reverence for 
nature is the foundation of the ethic of 
environmental stewardship that con-
tinues to guide our State. 
French explorers, led by Samuel de 
Champlain, first visited the area in 
1604. In 1607, more than a decade before

S1622 
March 9, 2020 
the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, bold 
English pioneers established Popham 
Colony and constructed the first sail-
ing ship built in North America. Ten 
years later, Captain John Smith sailed 
the North Atlantic coast and named 
the region ‘‘New England.’’ 
The European settlers that followed 
cleared farm fields, cut timber, and 
harvested the bounty of the sea. They 
harnessed rivers to power grain, lum-
ber, and textile mills. With pick and 
shovel, they built roads and, later, rail-
roads to connect communities to one 
another and Maine to the world. 
In June of 1775, just 2 months after 
Lexington and Concord, the first naval 
battle of the American Revolution was 
fought at Machias. Armed with nothing 
more than muskets, pitchforks, and 
axes, a militia of 30 patriots captured a 
British warship in a stunning Amer-
ican victory. When the British tried 
again to subdue that hotbed of revolu-
tion 2 years later, Passamaquoddy war-
riors joined with the local militia to 
repel the invasion. 
We are a State of immigrants, first 
from England, Scotland, and Ireland, 
then from Scandinavia. When the Aca-
dians fled persecution in British Can-
ada, many found new homes in Maine, 
establishing our rich Franco-American 
heritage. In recent years, Maine has 
opened its arms to thousands of refu-
gees from Somalia and other nations in 
Africa and the Middle East. 
Maine achieved statehood as a result 
of legislation that admitted two new 
States—Maine and Missouri—to the 
Union—one free, one slave. Freedom is 
a theme that resonates throughout 
Maine’s history. 
During the era when slavery stained 
our young Nation, Mainers were fer-
vent abolitionists and hosted a vital 
part of the Underground Railroad. It 
was in Maine that Harriet Beecher 
Stowe wrote ‘‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’’ the 
novel that brought the horror of slav-
ery into homes throughout America. 
During the Civil War, Maine provided 
more soldiers per capita to the Union 
cause than any other State. When 
Joshua 
Chamberlain 
and 
the 
20th 
Maine made their heroic charge at Lit-
tle Round Top, they turned the tide at 
Gettysburg and saved our Nation so 
that all people would be free. As the 
war neared its end, President Abraham 
Lincoln established a network of hos-
pitals to care for wounded veterans, 
the foundation of today’s VA. It was 
fitting that the very first of those hos-
pitals was in Maine. 
Maine also led the way in ensuring 
that all American citizens have the 
right to express themselves at the bal-
lot box. Maine provided some of the 
most effective leaders in the movement 
for women’s suffrage. Maine’s Governor 
and two Senators played key roles in 
the passage of the 19th Amendment 
that took effect 100 years ago, during 
Maine’s centennial year. 
Two episodes wonderfully describe 
the commitment of Maine people to 
liberty, equality, and dignity for all. In 
1837, the crew of a Maine schooner 
smuggled a slave from a southern port 
to our State and to freedom. The Gov-
ernor of the slave State demanded not 
just the return of the slave but also the 
extradition of the ship’s captain and 
first mate to face charges of theft of 
property. The response of Maine’s Gov-
ernor was blunt: ‘‘We do not consider 
people to be property.’’ 
In our time, in 2003, an out-of-State 
neo-Nazi 
White 
supremacist 
group 
brought its message of racial bigotry 
and anti-Semitism to Lewiston, a city 
that had recently opened its doors, and 
its heart, to refugees from Somalia. 
The rally for hate attracted barely 30 
people. The counter rally for humanity 
drew more than 4,000. Another 1,000 
gathered outside on a bitterly cold 
January day, unable to fit into the 
packed Bates College gym but unwill-
ing to let their voices go unheard. 
That is the real story of Maine—a 
noble history that is upheld and en-
hanced today. Farming, fisheries, and 
forest products remain vital parts of 
our economy, now joined by advanced 
manufacturing and world-leading bio-
medical research. Our maritime herit-
age continues at our two great ship-
yards that keep our Navy preeminent 
in the world. Mainers continue to serve 
in uniform and defend freedom—we 
have the second highest percentage of 
veterans in the Nation. The people of 
our State will always come to the aid 
of those in need and offer a haven to 
the oppressed. 
When Captain John Smith explored 
the Maine coast more than four cen-
turies ago, he wrote in his log that set-
tling that beautiful and untamed re-
gion would take ‘‘the best parts of art, 
judgment, 
courage, 
honesty, 
con-
stancy, diligence, and industry.’’ The 
people of Maine continue to dem-
onstrate those qualities, and it is an 
honor to celebrate this landmark anni-
versary with them. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I rec-
ognize the bicentennial anniversary of 
the great State of Maine, which will be 
celebrated on March 15, 2020. For the 
past 200 years, Maine has made monu-
mental contributions to our Nation 
and exemplified the best of America, 
with immense natural treasures sur-
passed only by the kindness, gen-
erosity, and work ethic of its people. 
With the Pine Tree State now entering 
its third century, we look back on the 
people and events that brought us to 
this milestone and look forward to all 
of the successes that lie ahead. 
Before it was ever known as Maine, 
the land was home to a number of In-
digenous Tribes that together formed 
the Wabanaki Confederacy; to this day, 
Maine continues to be home to the 
Wabanaki people and several Native 
Tribes who make invaluable contribu-
tions to our State and our culture. The 
land was settled as an independent col-
ony in the 17th century, before being 
later annexed by the colony of Massa-
chusetts. Maine existed under Massa-
chusetts’ rule until March 15, 1820, 
when it regained its independence from 
our southern neighbors as part of the 
Compromise of 1820 and was admitted 
as the 23rd State of the United States 
of America. 
Maine’s blessings are many. In the 
years since its admission to the United 
States, Maine has made major eco-
nomic contributions to the Nation. 
Maine people have proven to be re-
sourceful, adaptable, gritty, and hard- 
working, which, combined with our 
vast natural resources, have estab-
lished the State as a leader in vital in-
dustries. As the most forested State in 
the Nation, Maine’s timber industry 
thrived; with our thousands of miles of 
coastline, Maine people worked the 
waters and created one of the most lu-
crative and sustainable fisheries in the 
world. We have turned fertile farmland 
into a legacy of family farms and di-
versified agriculture, allowing Maine- 
grown food to be served across the Na-
tion, and we have harnessed unmatched 
scenery to establish our State as a 
leader in tourism, where visitors from 
around the globe wait all year to spend 
a week in Vacationland. In these indus-
tries and many more, Maine leads the 
way, and it all starts with the men, 
women, and families who make up the 
fabric of our communities and set the 
standard for the way life should be. 
Maine’s innate adaptability and de-
termination extends to every part of 
our society, including our choice of 
leaders. For generations, Maine’s elect-
ed officials have emphasized common 
sense and problem-solving above all, 
traits drawn directly from the State’s 
voters and values. The example set by 
Joshua Chamberlain, the Lion of Little 
Round Top, who led his men against 
impossible odds during the Civil War to 
strike major victories for the Union, 
exemplifies Maine’s focus on service 
over self. This legacy was furthered by 
Margaret Chase Smith as she stood up 
to the political powers of her day and 
chose country over party. There are so 
many other examples, from Ed Muskie 
to Bill Cohen to George Mitchell to 
Olympia Snowe, of how Maine’s leaders 
have championed some of the country’s 
most impactful pieces of legislation by 
focusing on results over partisanship, 
wielding an outsized influence given 
Maine’s population. It is not just na-
tional either; there are too many ex-
amples to list of State and local lead-
ers who have stepped forward to create 
a better Maine for all of our people. 
This legacy of fighting to achieve the 
difficult right instead of settling for 
the convenient wrong speaks to the 
unique independence of Maine citizens, 
who have always voted based on ideas, 
not on party. This approach is far too 
infrequent in our political discourse; 
on this subject, as on most, the Nation 
could use more of Maine’s sensibility. 
I have always said that Maine is like 
a big small town, with very long 
streets because, no matter where you 
live in Maine, we are all neighbors and 
we are all in service to each other. This 
focus on service is why Maine has long

had one of the highest rates of veterans 
per capita, and it is why towns across 
Maine offer a wide range of resources 
to help lift up our fellow citizens strug-
gling with challenges ranging from 
substance use disorders to unemploy-
ment to food insecurity. I have been 
lucky enough to travel to every corner 
and pocket of our State, and the way 
our communities care for our own 
never ceases to amaze me. No matter if 
it is a time of crisis or business as 
usual, Maine people are in it together. 
That is a profoundly rare phenomenon, 
and we are infinitely better for it. 
Maine’s motto, ‘‘Dirigo,’’ is simple, 
declarative, 
and 
fitting; 
translated 
from Latin, it means ‘‘I Lead.’’ That is 
exactly right: For the last 200 years, 
Maine has led the way, economically, 
politically, and socially. As we honor 
the 200th anniversary of Maine’s state-
hood, I know that our State is posi-
tioned to continue its leadership for 
generations to come. So, regardless of 
which of the 16 counties you are from, 
let us come together—as is the Maine 
tradition—and celebrate our great for-
tune to live, work, and play in the 
greatest State in the Nation. Happy 
200th birthday, Maine, and thanks to 
each and every person who makes our 
State so special. Thanks to your ef-
forts, I am certain we will see history 
repeat itself as Maine embarks on an-
other 200 years of prosperity, commu-
nity, common sense, and leadership. 
f 
55TH ANNIVERSARY OF ‘‘BLOODY 
SUNDAY’’ 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this past 
weekend marked the 55th anniversary 
of Bloody Sunday, one of the darkest 
moments in our democracy. On March 
7, 1965, Alabama law enforcement offi-
cers brutally attacked hundreds of 
peaceful demonstrators marching from 
Selma to Montgomery to demand full 
civil rights for African Americans. 
These brave protesters put their safety 
and liberty on the line to build an 
America that lives up to its ideals of 
freedom, justice, and equality. It is 
thanks to their heroism—and the her-
oism of many civil rights activists be-
fore and since—that our country has 
made 
great 
strides 
towards 
those 
ideals. However, in order to fully honor 
their struggle, we must also recognize 
that much of the hatred and discrimi-
nation which they fought to root out 
persists, although perhaps in less overt 
or easily recognized forms. 
One of the strongest, most disheart-
ening examples of this phenomenon is 
the ongoing assault on the right of mi-
norities to vote. This is not ancient 
history. States all over the country 
continue to ‘‘modernize’’ strategies de-
veloped a century ago to suppress Afri-
can-American voting power. Some of 
these strategies are blatant and rec-
ognizable, like mass purges of voter 
rolls; the gerrymandering of districts 
with ‘‘surgical precision,’’ according to 
one court; and intimidation of voters of 
color. Some of the strategies are dis-
guised behind excuses or fear tactics, 
like obstructive voter ID laws, felony 
disenfranchisement, and closures of 
polling sites in heavily minority-popu-
lated areas. 
So long as we allow these sorts of 
practices to continue, we are denying 
American citizens the right to vote 
promised to them by our Constitution, 
and we are undermining the integrity 
of our democracy. This is a problem on 
principle, of course—until we guar-
antee the right to vote regardless of 
race, we fall short of the unique prom-
ise and potential of the United States 
of America. But it is also a problem for 
broader practical reasons—when we ex-
clude people from fully participating in 
our democracy, we prevent them from 
achieving the social, economic, and 
civic reforms they need to strengthen 
their communities. 
So, what are we going to do about 
that? I know what I will do: I will fight 
for laws that will guarantee every 
American a voice in our democracy. 
That is why I have introduced bills like 
the Democracy Restoration Act, S.1068, 
to restore the Federal right to vote to 
ex-offenders, and the Deceptive Prac-
tices and Voter Intimidation and Sup-
pression Act, S.1834, to penalize the 
voter suppression efforts so frequently 
aimed at minority communities. 
It is also why I am a fervent sup-
porter of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. This bill, which was 
passed by the House of Representatives 
at the end of last year, would remedy 
the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision deci-
mating section 5 of the Voting Rights 
Act and thereby strengthen our ability 
to prevent discriminatory changes to 
State voting laws and procedures. I 
thank Senator LEAHY for championing 
this bill and call on Leader MCCONNELL 
and Chairman GRAHAM
to urgently 
bring H.R. 4 for consideration in Com-
mittee and in the Senate. 
Let’s honor all of those whose strug-
gles for freedom and equality through-
out our Nation’s history have been met 
with violence and hatred. Let’s carry 
on their torch and help make their 
dreams a reality. Let’s fulfill the right 
to vote.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of the League of Women Voters of 
the United States. With a commitment 
to civic participation, the League has 
secured its place nationally as a relied- 
upon source of voter education and a 
protector of voting rights. The centen-
nial celebration is a historical bench-
mark for the State of Michigan, as well 
as the entire Nation. 
Just 6 months before the ratification 
of the 19th Amendment, the suffragists 
of the National American Woman Suf-
frage Association as well as other suf-
frage groups embarked on a mission to 
ensure 
that 
voters, 
particularly 
women, would have the necessary non-
partisan information to make informed 
decisions on who and what to support 
in elections. With this newfound mis-
sion, the suffrage movement began a 
‘‘mighty 
political 
experiment’’ 
de-
signed to help 20 million women carry 
out their new civic duty. 
With Michigan women winning the 
right to vote in 1918, the mission to 
educate Michigan women voters start-
ed before the League was established 
nationally when the Michigan League 
of Women Voters formed out of the 
Michigan Equal Suffrage Association 
in 1919. The following year, they be-
came part of the League of Women 
Voters of the United States. The early 
Michigan LWV advocated for changes 
to State-level voter registration laws 
and civil service reform; they also es-
tablished citizenship classes through 
citizenship schools in people’s homes. 
Many of their actions influenced early 
programs of the National League, and 
the intent of those programs continue 
today through the League’s work. 
While the League is nonpartisan, 
even from their conception, the League 
used their voice and their platform for 
advocacy. One of their earliest initia-
tives was for child welfare reform, as 
well as civil service and election law 
reforms across the country. In 1941, the 
League 
advocated 
successfully 
for 
amending Michigan State law to forbid 
factory work by those under 16 and to 
mandate school attendance by all chil-
dren between the ages of 7 and 16. 
Other major legislation the League ad-
vocated for includes the Equal Rights 
Amendment, National Voter Registra-
tion Act, and the Help America Vote 
Act. 
Today, Leagues from 
across 
the 
country advocate for issues such as 
fighting voter suppression, limiting the 
influence of money in politics, and re-
districting. They are constantly en-
couraging and pushing for further in-
vestment in our election infrastructure 
and election security. With a presence 
in over 700 communities and across all 
50 States, the League of Women Voters 
of the United States has become an ac-

f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petition or memorial 
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as 
indicated: 
POM–187. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
urging the United States Congress to enact 
legislation providing for a five year transi-
tion period to enforce the provisions of the 
Farm Bill through which the Animal Welfare 
Act (7 U.S.C. section 2156) is applied to Puer-
to Rico, banning any type of animal fighting 
venture; to the Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry. 
JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 126 
The United States Congress passed the 
H.R. 2 Conference Report, known as the 
Farm Bill, which included an amendment to 
the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2156) ex-
tending the application thereof to Puerto 
Rico. The aforementioned statute bans all 
animal 
fighting 
ventures 
including 
cockfights. 
Cockfighting is considered a traditional 
sport in Puerto Rico which has been deeply 
rooted in our culture and history for over 
five hundred years. Cockfights in Puerto 
Rico are regulated by Act No. 98–2007, as 
amended, known as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Game-
cocks of the New Millennium Act,’’ and by 
Regulation No. 7424. Both the Act and the 
regulations in effect, which stem from our 
extensive experience holding cockfights offi-
cially overseen by the State, regulate, con-
trol, oversee, and promote all the activities 
related to this sport. 
In Puerto Rico there are over seventy (70) 
cockpits distributed among forty-five ( 45) 
municipalities throughout the Island. This 
industry creates a total of eleven thousand 
one hundred and thirty-four (11,134) direct, 
indirect, and induced jobs. The cockfighting 
industry injects $65 million annually into 
Puerto Rico’s economy mainly from the con-
sumption of agricultural products, gamecock 
farms, medications, vitamins, services, tour-
ism, establishment operations, attendee con-
sumption, permits, and licenses. Just in one 
year, a total of eighty-eight thousand three 
hundred (88,300) cockfights were held for a 
total three hundred and forty-four thousand 
(344,000) attendees. 
The one (1)-year transition period provided 
by this Act is not enough to mitigate the 
economic impact it shall have on the Island, 
nor does it provide enough time for the fed-
eral law enforcement agencies to implement 
it. Therefore, it would promote the prolifera-
tion of underground cockfights. 
Thus, it is essential to allow for a five (5)- 
year transition process. It is very important

to provide the people employed by this in-
dustry with a reasonable amount of time to 
transition to other industries so that our 
economic recovery is not affected by the sud-
den blow of the cockfighting ban. 
The adoption of this federal statute shall 
affect the resources of the United States and 
Puerto Rico governments on several fronts 
on account of: (i) the need for resources and 
personnel to seize 176,000 gamecocks without 
having any place for them or management 
protocols; (ii) the federal Government has 
not determined whether having gamecocks 
shall be illegal or whether the owners shall 
have to maintain them; (iii) having to train 
personnel to handle gamecocks: (iv) the clos-
ing of seventy (70) establishments that pay 
license fees, water and electric power bills, 
municipal license fees, and other utilities; 
and (v) job retraining assistance for 11,134 
employees; (vi) the loss of $65 million for the 
Island’s economy which includes taxes, ex-
cise taxes, product consumption, tourism, 
and bird feed, among others. 
In addition, the direct revenues from the 
gamecock industry, not counting licenses, 
taxes, and others, go to sports programs for 
Puerto Rican children through the Sports 
and Recreation Department. 
For all of the foregoing, this Legislative 
Assembly deems it pertinent to request the 
Governor of Puerto Rico, the Hon. Wanda 
Va´zquez-Garced, and the Resident Commis-
sioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, the 
Hon. Jenniffer Gonza´lez-Colo´n, to take the 
necessary steps to urge the Congress of the 
United States of America to enact legisla-
tion providing for a five (5)-year transition 
period to enforce the provisions of the Farm 
Bill through which the Animal Welfare Act 
(7 U.S.C. § 2156) is applied to Puerto Rico ban-
ning any type of animal fighting venture, in-
cluding cockfights; and direct the develop-
ment of five (5)-year transition program. 
Likewise, the transition period should allow 
for the development of economic studies as 
are necessary; the establishment of protocols 
for the transition, and management and dis-
posal of gamecocks; as well as the retraining 
and reemployment programs for persons who 
were part of the Puerto Rico cockfighting 
sport and industry. 
Be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of 
Puerto Rico: 
Section 1.—To request the Governor of 
Puerto Rico, the Hon. Wanda Va´zquez- 
Garced, and the Resident Commissioner of 
Puerto 
Rico 
in 
Washington, 
the 
Hon. 
Jenniffer Gonza´lez-Colo´n, to take the nec-
essary steps to urge the Congress of the 
United States of America to enact legisla-
tion providing for a five (5)-year transition 
period to enforce the provisions of the Farm 
Bill through which the Animal Welfare Act 
(7 U.S.C. § 2156) is applied to Puerto Rico ban-
ning any type of animal fighting venture, in-
cluding cockfights. 
Section 2.—To request the Governor of 
Puerto Rico, the Hon. Wanda Va´zquez- 
Garced, and the Resident Commissioner of 
Puerto 
Rico 
in 
Washington, 
the 
Hon. 
Jenniffer Gonza´lez-Colo´n to jointly develop a 
work plan for a five (5)-year transition pe-
riod that allows for the development of eco-
nomic studies as are necessary; the estab-
lishment of protocols for the transition, and 
management and disposal of gamecocks; as 
well as the retraining and reemployment 
programs for persons who were part of the 
Puerto Rico cockfighting sport and industry. 
Said plan shall be included in the presen-
tations given to the United States Congress 
and the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. 
This work plan shall be drafted within one 
hundred and eighty (180) days as of the ap-
proval of this Joint Resolution. 
Section 3.—A copy of this Joint Resolution 
translated into English shall be delivered to 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives; the President Pro Tempore 
of the Senate; and to the party leaders of the 
United States House of Representatives and 
Senate. 
Section 4.—This Joint Resolution shall 
take effect immediately after its approval.

SENATE RESOLUTION 536—RECOG-
NIZING THE BALTIC STATES OF 
ESTONIA, 
LATVIA, 
AND 
LITH-
UANIA ON THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE RESTORATION OF 
THEIR INDEPENDENCE 
Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. GRASS-
LEY, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. PETERS, Mr. 
ROUNDS, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Ms. COLLINS,

Mr. CARDIN, Mr. RUBIO, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, 
Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. PERDUE, 
Mr. REED, and Ms. STABENOW) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 536 
Whereas, 3 decades ago, the peoples of Es-
tonia, Latvia, and Lithuania inspired the 
world through their victory over the forces 
of Soviet totalitarianism after decades of re-
sistance; 
Whereas the Baltic States of Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania originally declared their 
independence in 1918 and established diplo-
matic relations with the United States as 
independent countries on July 28, 1922; 
Whereas, 100 years ago this year, Soviet 
Russia signed treaties with Estonia, Latvia, 
and Lithuania recognizing their sovereignty 
and renouncing all territorial claims over 
each Baltic State in perpetuity; 
Whereas, on August 23, 1939, the Soviet 
Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molo-
tov-Ribbentrop Pact, which contained a se-
cret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into 
spheres of influence, with the Baltic States 
ultimately being assigned to the Soviet 
Union, leading soon after to the forcible in-
corporation of the Baltic States into the So-
viet Union; 
Whereas, following World War II, the So-
viet Union occupied the Baltic States, im-
posing for more than 5 decades its model of 
Soviet totalitarianism, which the United 
States never recognized, instead maintaining 
98 years of continuous diplomatic relations 
with the Baltic States; 
Whereas, in August 1989, approximately 
2,000,000 people joined hands in Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania to form a 373-mile human 
chain across the 3 states known as the Baltic 
Chain of Freedom; 
Whereas, in February 1990, the people of 
Lithuania participated in the first free elec-
tion to select a new parliament, which 
promptly voted for restoration of independ-
ence, making Lithuania the first occupied 
Soviet republic to declare the restoration of 
independence on March 11, 1990, a move sub-
sequently followed by Latvia on May 4, 1990, 
and Estonia on August 20, 1991; 
Whereas, in January 1991, Soviet military 
forces tried to quash the growing independ-
ence restoration movement, leading to ap-
proximately 14 Lithuanian deaths, as well as 
6 Latvian deaths and many injuries; 
Whereas, in February and March 1991, the 
Lithuanian, Estonian, and Latvian people 
voted overwhelmingly in support of their re-
spective independence restoration referen-
dums, which the United States recognized 
later that year; 
Whereas the Baltic States helped pave the 
path for democracy and freedom across East-
ern Europe, leading to the fall of the Soviet 
Union; 
Whereas, after restoration of independence, 
the economies of Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
uania emerged as modern market economies 
leading in technology and financial services 
sectors; 
Whereas Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
continue to demonstrate their commitment 
to advancing democratic values, peace, and 
security through their membership and ac-
tive participation in the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO), the European 
Union (EU), and the Organisation for Eco-
nomic 
Co-operation 
and 
Development 
(OECD); 
Whereas the Baltic States have been loyal 
NATO allies, contributing to regional secu-
rity and global security through operations 
in Afghanistan and leadership in the NATO 
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excel-
lence in Estonia, the NATO Strategic Com-
munications Centre of Excellence in Latvia, 
and the NATO Energy Security Centre of Ex-
cellence in Lithuania; 
Whereas the Baltic States further their 
contributions to the security of the Euro-At-
lantic area by spending at least 2 percent of 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for defense, 
and contribute to global security through de-
termined participation in international al-
lied operations and missions; 
Whereas, since their restoration of inde-
pendence in 1990 and 1991, Estonia, Latvia, 
and Lithuania have faced considerable Rus-
sian aggressive behavior, intimidation, and 
cyber attacks, and as a result have worked 
to shape total defense strategies to counter 
Russian intervention; 
Whereas the Government of the Russian 
Federation 
has 
pursued 
an 
aggressive 
disinformation 
campaign 
in 
the 
Baltic 
States, including intimidation of Western ci-
vilians and troops stationed in Europe and 
abroad via hacking, pushing propaganda, and 
other cyber attacks, and has increased air 
provocations in Eastern Europe; 
Whereas the presence of the United States 
in the Baltic States remains a crucial factor 
for ensuring security in the region and com-
plements the efforts of NATO to strengthen 
its deterrence and defense posture, including 
an Enhanced Forward Presence posture in 
the eastern part of the Alliance with multi-
national battlegroups; 
Whereas, in 2019, the United States and the 
Baltic States signed the Security Coopera-
tion Roadmaps outlining joint security co-
operation priorities for 2019 to 2024; 
Whereas the Baltic States have been mod-
els for democratic governance with strong 
institutions and respect for civil liberties 
and the rule of law, cherished shared values 
between the Baltic States and the United 
States; and 
Whereas the democratic development and 
progress of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
since those countries regained independence 
has established the Baltic States as 3 shining 
beacons for freedom: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the Baltic States of Esto-
nia, Latvia, and Lithuania on the 30th anni-
versary of the restoration of their independ-
ence; 
(2) commits continued support for the Bal-
tic allies of the United States through eco-
nomic and security cooperation, further 
strengthening transatlantic ties and regional 
presence; 
(3) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the enduring transatlantic 
alliance; 
(4) recognizes the courage and resilience of 
the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian peo-
ple in their fight for freedom and democracy 
in the face of Russian aggressive behavior; 
and 
(5) expresses the wish that the next 30 
years of friendship between the Baltic States 
and the United States are just as full of posi-
tive achievements and progress as the last 30 
years have been.

ANTHONY ALEXANDER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Anthony Alex-
ander for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Anthony Alexander is a student at Jefferson 
High School and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Anthony 
Alexander is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to An-
thony Alexander for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future 
accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING 
STAPLES

SCHOOL’S 
‘‘WE 
THE 
PEOPLE’’ 
TEAM 
HON. JAMES A. HIMES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the first-place finish of Staples High 
School students in Connecticut’s We The Peo-
ple: The Citizen and the Constitution competi-
tion. 
In the Constitution State, we take our obli-
gation to the values and principles laid out in 
our founding document seriously. The We The 
People program helps students develop an in- 
depth understanding of the Constitution by 
building their civic and research skills and test-
ing their knowledge about how our govern-
ment works. 
Ensuring a better future for Southwest Con-
necticut will require that our students be able 
to articulate a vision for our country that re-
flects the basic principles underlying the Con-
stitution. Staples High School’s We The Peo-
ple team’s success is proof that these guiding 
values will be carried on by future generations. 
Staples High School joins the ranks of sev-
eral state champions stemming from the 
Fourth Congressional District. In April, Staples 
will compete in the National Finals in Wash-
ington, D.C., against teams from across the 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in 
congratulating the following students: Surya 
Balaji, Taha Banatwala, Lucy Belknap, Brian 
Campbell, Violet Cooper, Lars Djuve, Michael 
Farnen, Dylan Goodman, Grace Katz, Kashvi

I join the Westport community and Fourth

students, along with their teacher Suzanne 
Kammerman, on this accomplishment.

RECOGNIZING MEGAN LYNCH ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize Ms. Megan Lynch 
on her retirement from the Eden Township 
Healthcare District (District) Board of Directors 
on February 20, 2020. 
Megan has long held a passion for public 
health and welfare, from as early as her role 
as a kitchen aide at the Eden Medical Center 
during her college years. She earned a bach-
elor’s degree in integrative biology at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley, and in 2015 
earned a master’s degree in health care ad-
ministration from the California State Univer-
sity, East Bay. 
Much of Megan’s fantastic work has been 
with healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente. 
As part of its Delivery System Strategy team, 
she has risen through the ranks over the past 
five years, serving as an associate planning 
manager since 2018. Megan also was se-
lected to complete Kaiser Permanente’s North-
ern California Region’s Emerging Leaders De-
velopment Program that year, a testament to 
her strong leadership and dedication to the 
well-being of the community. 
Megan’s work to promote the health of her 
neighbors has not been restricted to her roles 
with Kaiser Permanente. Since 2016, Megan 
has served on the board of directors for the 
Eden Township Healthcare District (ETHD), 
and as its vice chair in 2019. On that board, 
she was instrumental in helping steer ETHD 
away from possible dissolution by the Local 
Agency Formation Commission in Alameda 
County, and as chair of ETHD’s Community 
Health Advisory Committee. 
Meanwhile, Megan has served as the third 
vice president at the Eden Medical Center 
Auxiliary, and in 2019 as a member of the 
Davis Street Family Resource Center’s board 
of directors, helping its vision to provide inte-
grated services to improve the quality of life in 
the Eden Area. In her spare time, Megan also 
volunteers at CityTeam Oakland to help those 
experiencing homelessness and poverty or 
suffering hunger and addiction. 
Stepping down from her position with ETHD, 
Megan is preparing to fulfill her dream to be-
come an emergency medicine physician by 
entering medical school this summer. I wish 
her all the best as she prepares for her stud-
ies, and I know that she will continue to be a 
strong advocate for local healthcare.

Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Benallo for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Abigail Benallo is a student at Drake Middle 
School and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Abigail 
Benallo is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will

I extend my deepest congratulations to Abi-

cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE 
TAMAYO 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a great American and promi-
nent leader in the veteran community in Bur-
lington County, Joe Tamayo. 
Joe Tamayo’s life was defined by his serv-
ice to his country, his community, and those in 
need. Joe was drafted into the Army to fight 
in the Korean war, where he served five tours 
and earned a Purple Heart for wounds re-
ceived in combat during the battle of Pork 
Chop Hill. After he left Korea, Joe served two 
tours of duty in Germany, as well as a tour in 
Vietnam, before eventually returning to the 
United States on assignment at Fort Dix, New 
Jersey. 
In addition to his Purple Heart, throughout 
his time in the Army Joe received a number of 
awards and decorations, including the Bronze 
Star with ‘‘V’’ for Valor, a Combat Infantry 
Badge, a National Defense Service Medal, 
and an Armed Forces Expeditionary Service 
Medal. After twenty-two years of service to his 
country, Joe retired from active duty in 1973. 
Despite his retirement, Joe continued to 
seek out ways to serve his community and 
care for those in need. Joe focused his energy 
on troubled youth and took a position working 
at the New Jersey Children’s Home in Mt. 
Holly, New Jersey. For thirty years at the Chil-
dren’s Home, Joe worked to instill a sense of 
pride, self-respect, discipline and self-worth in 
his students. 
After retiring from his work with the Chil-
dren’s home, Joe continued to be an active 
member of several Veteran Service Organiza-
tions including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
Purple Heart Association, American Legion, 
Disabled American Veterans, Vietnam Vet-
erans of America, and the 24th Infantry Regi-
ment Combat Team Association, otherwise 
known as the Buffalo Soldiers. Throughout his 
life after his time in the military, Joe main-
tained his commitment to service and helped 
to support his fellow veterans in Burlington 
County. 
Joe Tamayo’s story is a reminder to all of 
us that our veterans make incredible sacrifices 
not just to defend our nation, but also to sup-
port our communities and those most in need. 
I thank Joe for his lifetime of service to our na-
tion and offer my deepest condolences to his 
family and friends.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL ALLEN 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor the memory of Christopher Michael 
Allen, who passed away at the age of 47 in 
his home in Jackson, Mississippi, on March 
28, 2019, while surrounded by his family and 
friends. Chris dedicated much of his attention 
to raising his three daughters, Anna Leigh, 
Addy Katherine, and Mills, was an avid Ole 
Miss sports fan, and loved attending sporting 
events with friends. 
Chris also enjoyed spending time with his 
many friends and loved ones and was known 
as a loyal friend. A close companion of Chris 
once said that every one of his friends has 
thought of Chris Allen as their best friend at 
one time or another. Chris used his smile, 
humor, and kind heart to comfort those around 
him and to create joy in those who shared his 
company. His family and his friends viewed 
his company as a blessing. 
Earlier last year, Chris was diagnosed with 
progressive 
multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy 
(PML), a rare viral brain disease that never 
impacted Chris’s desire to care for his loving 
family and close friends. He is survived by his 
daughters, Anna Leigh Allen, Addy Katherine 
Allen, and Mills Allen; their mother Leigh Ann 
Allen; his mother, Debbie Allen; siblings 
Robby Allen (Ashley) and Brooke Chandler 
(Chan); and a multitude of extended family 
and friends who continue to remember the joy 
he brought to their lives.

Monday, March 9, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Chief Finan-
cial Officer Salary Home Rule Act, which 
would give the District of Columbia the author-
ity to raise the pay of its Chief Financial Offi-
cer (CFO). There is no reason the District 
should not have the authority to set the pay of 
every local official who is paid with local funds, 
as a matter of its existing home-rule authority. 
In 2013, Congress enacted a law that gave 
the District more authority to set the CFO’s 
pay. However, Congress did not give D.C. full 
and complete authority over this local matter. 
This bill would give D.C. the authority to set 
the CFO’s pay commensurate with its best 
judgment based on factors such as compari-
sons with similar positions elsewhere, the 
competitive market, and other factors gen-
erally used in determining pay. I was able to 
get at least some needed change in 2013 by 
amending the Home Rule Act to change the 
CFO’s salary from a fixed rate of pay that was 
tied to a federal pay schedule to a maximum 
allowable pay, or ceiling, tied to a federal pay 
schedule. That ceiling was and is substantially 
higher than the fixed rate. However, D.C. 
should have full control over setting the sala-
ries of its own employees. 
I introduced the 2013 bill after a D.C. CFO 
search committee indicated that the fixed rate 
of pay was not high enough to attract the best 
talent needed for this complex and demanding 
job. The responsibilities of the CFO, a position 
created by Congress, are unique in the United 
States. The CFO is extraordinarily powerful 
and independent. The District cannot obligate 
or expend funds without the CFO’s approval, 
and the CFO can be terminated only ‘‘for 
cause.’’ My bill would not allow the CFO’s sal-
ary to be lowered and maintains the ‘‘for 
cause’’ termination provision, so as to pre-
serve the independence of the position. The 
District needs the authority to pay the rate 
necessary to retain and attract the best CFOs, 
especially since the District must compete with 
the private sector for highly qualified CFOs. 
This is an important step to increase nec-
essary home-rule authority for the District, and 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING NANCY MARTIN ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Nancy 
Martin who plans to retire next month after 
nearly 43 years of service to the federal gov-
ernment. 
After growing up in the Chicago suburb of 
Arlington Heights in Illinois, Nancy earned an 
Associate of Arts degree from Cottey College 
in Nevada, Missouri and a Bachelor of Arts 
degree from the American University in Wash-
ington, DC. Nancy’s career as a civil servant 
began at the Veteran’s Administration in 1977. 
Less than a year later, she accepted a job at 
what was then called the Office of Education 
in the Department of Health, Education, and 
Welfare. She helped with the transition team 
during the creation of the Department of Edu-
cation as a separate Cabinet agency in 1980. 
She has shaken hands with every U.S. Sec-
retary of Education. 
In 1987, Nancy joined the Department of 
Education’s Budget Service. Over the past 33 
years, Nancy has been involved in the formu-
lation and presentation of the President’s 
Budget and related documents and tables and 
is the lead in the development of the annual 
Congressional Budget Justifications. I thank 
Nancy for her dedication to the Department 
and its mission to foster educational excel-
lence and ensure equal access. 
Nancy has been an indispensable resource 
to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education and Related 
Agencies, which I chair. In addition to her ex-
pertise in the budget process, she has always 
approached our technical assistance needs 
with the utmost professionalism and attention, 
providing the support necessary for us to craft 
Department of Education appropriations bills. 
For that I am deeply grateful. 
Nancy’s dedication to public extends outside 
of the Department of Education. She served 
as a volunteer and docent with the Friends of 
the National Zoo for over 20 years and cur-
rently serves on the board of an organization 
that connects our Nation’s military veterans 
with shelter animals. 
We will feel the void left by her retirement 
going forward. I thank Nancy for her service 
and congratulate her on her upcoming retire-
ment.

RECOGNIZING GOVERNOR BRAD 
LITTLE 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize an Eastern Idaho Agriculture Hall 
of Fame inductee, Governor Brad Little. 
Governor Brad Little has been a champion 
for agriculture his entire life. His advocacy 
started while being raised on his family’s Em-
mett, Idaho sheep and cattle ranching oper-
ation. Later in life, Little became a public serv-
ant and continued to protect and advance the 
agriculture industry in the Idaho State Senate 
then as Idaho’s Lieutenant Governor and cur-
rently as Idaho’s Governor. 
In 1977, Little graduated with an Agri-
business Degree from the University of Idaho. 
He went on to work on his families ranching 
operation. With over three decades of man-
aging the farming and ranching, our Governor 
is a leader who understands what it takes to 
be successful in agriculture. 
In 2001, Little began his public service ca-
reer when he was appointed to fill an Idaho 
State Senate seat. In the senate, he focused 
on the agricultural affairs, resources and envi-
ronment, and economic outlook. As a member 
of these committees, Little played a substan-
tial role ensuring the security and increasing 
productivity of farms and ranches across 
Idaho. He went on to become both Idaho’s 
Lieutenant Governor and Governor where he 
has continued to promote and defend agri-
culture in Idaho. 
Whether he is meeting with the President in 
the White House or a neighbor on his family 
farm in Emmet, he can be found wearing cow-
boy boots, and demonstrating a commitment 
to hard work and integrity. Governor Little is a 
proud voice for Idaho and our agriculture com-
munity, and I am honored to call him a friend. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to join the 
Eastern Idaho agriculture community in con-
gratulate Governor Brad Little on being in-
ducted into the 2020 Eastern Idaho Agriculture 
Hall of Fame.

ABORTION RIGHTS AND JUNE 
MEDICAL SERVICES LLC V. RUSSO 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, Congresswoman LAW-
RENCE of Michigan for anchoring this very im-
portant Special Order to affirm our unequivo-
cal opposition to any effort to turn the clock 
back or to limit or undermine women’s right to 
make their own choices regarding their repro-
ductive healthcare. 
The United States Supreme Court ruled 
over 40 years ago, in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 
113 (1973)), that a woman’s constitutional 
right to privacy includes her right to abortion. 
Since this landmark decision, abortion rates 
and risks have substantially declined, as have 
the number of teen and unwanted preg-
nancies. 
Restricting all access to reproductive and 
women’s health services only exacerbates a 
woman’s risk of an unintended pregnancy and 
fails to accomplish any meaningful overthrow 
of Roe v. Wade. 
In recent years, state policymakers have 
passed hundreds of restrictions on abortion 
care under the guise of protecting women’s 
health and safety. Fights here in Congress 
have been no different. 
In my state of Texas, a law that would have 
cut off access to 75 percent of reproductive 
healthcare clinics in the state was challenged 
before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 
2015. 
On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court 
struck down as unconstitutional a Texas law 
that required that all reproductive healthcare 
clinics that provided the full range of services 
would be required to have a hospital-style sur-
gery center building and staffing requirements. 
This requirement meant that only 7 clinics 
would be allowed to continue to provide a full 
spectrum 
of 
reproductive 
healthcare 
to 
women. 
Texas has 268,580 square miles only sec-
ond in size to the state of California. 
The impact of the law in implementation 
would have ended access to reproductive 
services for millions of women in my state. 
In 2015, the State of Texas once again 
threatened women’s access to reproductive 
health care when it attempted to shutter all but 
10 healthcare providers in the state of Texas. 
The Supreme Court once again intervened 
on behalf of Texas women to block the move 
to close clinics in my state. 
It seems every month we are faced with a 
new attack on women’s access to reproductive 
health care, often couched in those same 
terms. 
If opponents were so concerned about 
women’s health and safety, they would be pro-
moting any one of the number of evidence- 
based proactive policies that improve women’s 
health and well-being. 
Instead, they are continuing their assault on 
women’s constitutional rights and their cam-
paign to outlaw abortion. 
That is their number one priority; it is cer-
tainly not about protecting women’s health, it 
is about politics. 
The consequences of these efforts are often 
felt most acutely by people who already face 
barriers to care, including communities of 
color, young people, LGBTQ people, and peo-
ple with low incomes. 
For the first time since Justices Brett 
Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch were seated on 
the Supreme Court, and this morning the 
Court heard oral arguments in June Medical 
Services LLC v. Russo, a case that could 
render the protections of Roe v. Wade virtually 
meaningless, paving the way for states to ef-
fectively ban abortion for over 25 million peo-
ple of reproductive age.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E278 
March 9, 2020 
During 2019 state legislative sessions alone, 
more than 300 anti-abortion bills were intro-
duced, and 58 restrictions were enacted— 
nearly half of which were abortion bans. 
Right now, six states are pushing for anti- 
abortion constitutional amendments. 
There are five states in the nation that al-
ready have only one abortion provider. 
This President has packed the courts in un-
precedented and extraordinary ways. 
Nearly 200 Trump-appointed judges now oc-
cupy lifetime positions on the federal bench, 
many with extreme records hostile to repro-
ductive health and rights, and are poised to 
make decisions about our reproductive rights 
and health for a generation. 
And these fights go beyond abortion. 
The administration’s domestic gag rule 
forced Planned Parenthood and other health 
care providers out of Title X, the nation’s only 
program dedicated to affordable birth control 
and other reproductive health care. 
The move jeopardized health care for Title 
X’s four million patients, 40 percent of whom 
received care at Planned Parenthood health 
centers prior to the rule. 
Last month, the administration approved 
Texas’ request to implement a Medicaid family 
planning program that bars patients from ac-
cessing care at Planned Parenthood. 
When Texas first barred Planned Parent-
hood from serving patients, nearly 40 percent 
fewer women got the health care they needed. 
This sets a dangerous precedent for other 
states, which could now pursue similar state- 
level measures with grim consequences for 
health care access nationwide. 
Madam Speaker, this is not what the Amer-
ican people want. 
Support for abortion access is at an all-time 
high; nearly 80 percent of Americans do not 
want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. 
There is no state in the nation where mak-
ing abortion illegal is popular. 
The American people want more access to 
health care, not less, and it is more critical 
than ever to see through this inflammatory 
misinformation campaign. 
Madam Speaker, the right to make deci-
sions about reproductive health care, including 
abortion, is central to individual equality. 
The right enables a person to decide if, 
when, and how to start and grow their family. 
It enables people to pursue and advance in 
their education and employment, and to be full 
and equal participants in society. 
Laws that restrict reproductive freedom, in-
cluding restrictions on abortion and birth con-
trol, perpetuate harmful stereotypes about 
gender roles and undermine gender equality. 
Courts, federal law, and the public have 
long connected reproductive freedom with 
equality. 
Reproductive freedom is central to women’s 
equality, for as the Supreme Court said in 
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ‘‘The ability of 
women to participate equally in the economic 
and social life of the Nation has been facili-
tated by their ability to control their reproduc-
tive lives.’’ 
Americans understand this connection and it 
is reflected in a January 2019 national poll 
showing 71 percent of voters agree—48 per-
cent agree strongly—that equal rights for 
women includes access to reproductive health 
care.

PROTECTING 
AMERICAN 
LUNGS 
AND REVERSING THE YOUTH TO-
BACCO EPIDEMIC ACT (H.R. 2339) 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2339, the Protecting American 
Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epi-
demic Act. 
After years of declining smoking rates in the 
United States, the introduction of e-cigarettes 
has caused an alarming uptick in the rate of 
smoking, particularly amongst younger Ameri-
cans. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, 
more than 5.3 million middle school and high 
school students used e-cigarettes in 2019, an 
alarming increase of more than 3 million in 
two years. 
H.R. 2339 offers a comprehensive approach 
for how we can reverse the youth vaping epi-
demic by banning promotion and advertising 
targeted at kids, taxing e-cigarettes the same 
way we tax other forms of tobacco, and ban-
ning online sales of most tobacco products. 
More specifically, this bill fulfills the promise 
that the Trump Administration failed to follow 
through with by banning all flavors for e-ciga-
rettes and e-liquids for devices that use open- 
tank systems. 
While I support the overall bill, I maintain 
some concerns with certain provisions within 
the legislation. Specifically, I am concerned 
with the effects this flavor ban may have for 
older Americans that use pipe tobacco and/or 
hookah. Some of my constituents who have 
been using the same flavored tobacco for 
pipes or hookah for decades should not be 
forced to give up their flavor of preference, es-
pecially when statistics indicate that younger 
Americans are not prone to use these prod-
ucts. 
Although I have these various concerns, I 
am still eager to take on ‘‘Big Nicotine’’ and 
support the passage of H.R. 2339 to curb 
youth tobacco usage. I look forward to fixing 
any issues my colleagues and I may have 
when this bill goes to conference with the 
Senate. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for Protecting American Lungs and Re-
versing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.

TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ 
FLOYD ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to recognize a visionary social justice advo-
cate and leader in my state who is retiring 
after several decades of working to improve 
the lives of his fellow citizens. 
William (‘‘Bill’’) Floyd trained as a social 
worker, held leadership roles in state govern-
ment, and worked for over three decades to 
develop housing and provide services for indi-
viduals with disabilities, people with very low 
income, and those experiencing homeless-
ness. His advocacy on behalf of marginalized 
Mainers is legendary, and in 2015, Bill re-
ceived the Joseph Brannigan Community Ex-
cellence Award in recognition of his work to 
address the housing and support needs of in-
dividuals with mental illness. 
His commitment to volunteerism is exempli-
fied by leading and serving on myriad boards, 
including Mobius, Inc., the Maine Association 
of Nonprofits, the Northern New England 
Housing Investment Fund, and the Community 
Development Advisory Council for the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston. Prior to becoming 
the Executive Director of the Genesis Fund in 
2007, he also served six years on their Board 
of Directors. 
The Genesis Fund, a Certified Community 
Development Financial Institution, provides in-
novative financing to create affordable housing 
and community facilities for underserved peo-
ple and communities. Under Bill Floyd’s lead-
ership, both their assets and loan portfolio 
have grown by over 600 percent, and they 
have extended their reach by providing tech-
nical assistance to nonprofit organizations 
across Maine seeking state, federal, and pri-
vate funding opportunities. 
Bill Floyd’s leadership at the Genesis Fund 
has resulted in resources for some of Maine’s 
most vulnerable citizens, including single par-
ents and their children, low-income working 
families, the elderly, homeless individuals and 
families, and people with disabilities. Bill 
knows that the impact of affordable housing 
on individuals and families is profound and 
leads to better health, improved student per-
formance, better job opportunities, and in-
creased financial stability and personal secu-
rity. Further, it transforms entire communities. 
Bill Floyd has spent his professional life en-
suring that no one in our society be written off. 
His public service to struggling individuals, 
families, and communities across Maine has 
left a legacy, and for that I thank him whole-
heartedly and wish him all the best in his re-
tirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JON 
MYERS 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Jon Myers for his dedicated service 
to Whitley County, Indiana. Hoosiers in my 
hometown of Columbia City and throughout 
Whitley County owe a great debt of gratitude 
to Jon for ushering our region into a more 
prosperous future, and we wish him the very 
best as he retires from his post as president 
of Whitley County Economic Development 
Corporation (EDC). 
Under Jon’s leadership, the Whitley County 
EDC has flourished. As of 2019, Whitley 
County has higher homeownership, a higher 
workforce participation rate, more people with 
health insurance, and fewer residents in pov-
erty than compared to the national average. 
The opportunity and prosperity Whitley County 
enjoy today is due in no small part to Jon’s 
leadership. 
Jon’s career is distinguished, defined by his 
active role in the broader northeast Indiana 
community. Prior to serving on Mitch Daniels’ 
campaign for governor in 2004, Myers helped 
establish 
the 
law 
firm 
of 
Myers 
and 
Hockemeyer and held a senior role with Lin-
coln Life. In 2005, Jon became manager of 
the Indiana EDC office in Fort Wayne, where, 
in the years thereafter, determined to address 
problems facing Whitley County. 
He has worked tirelessly to ensure those liv-
ing in the region have good jobs, can support 
their families and have the best quality of life. 
Although he will no longer lead the Whitley 
County EDC, his legacy will endure, and his 
commitment to the community and state will 
serve as a proud example for others in the 
years to come.

The dedication demonstrated by Aneisha 
Morris is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Aneisha Morris for winning the Arvada Wheat

TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY HERR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Jeffrey Herr, who is retiring from the 
City of Los Angeles as Curator of the Holly-
hock House in Barnsdall Park, Los Angeles 
and Curator of The Watts Towers in Los An-
geles. 
For more than three decades, Mr. Herr has 
dedicated his career to the preservation, ap-
preciation, management and creation of the 
arts. From his early years as an intern at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) 
to his present position as Curator of two nota-
ble institutions, Jeffrey has had a significant 
impact on the historic, arts and cultural com-
munity in Los Angeles. 
In 1988, after his internship at LACMA 
ended, Mr. Herr became a Research Assistant 
in the Decorative Arts Department at LACMA, 
and then the Assistant Gallery Director at the 
Couturier Gallery, which specialized in the 
American Arts and Crafts era, where he de-
signed, curated and installed art exhibitions. 
Following that, he joined the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles (UCLA)’s Extension Pro-
gram, where he created and presented lec-
tures on the American Arts and Crafts move-
ment. 
Mr. Herr’s long and illustrious career with 
the City of Los Angeles began in 1990 when 
he was selected as Curator of the City’s De-
partment of Cultural Affairs for three years, ar-
ranging exhibitions for galleries such as the 
gallery in the Hollyhock House and at the Los 
Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, before moving 
on to become Arts Manager of the depart-
ment, where he oversaw a cultural grants pro-
gram that awarded three million dollars annu-
ally to 250 arts organizations and artists. In 
1996, Jeffrey accepted the position of Director 
of the Banning Residence Museum, imple-
menting and overseeing professional museum 
standards and restoration of the historic 1864 
Victorian structure. 
In 2001, Mr. Herr became the Arts Manager 
of Los Angeles’ Department of Cultural Affairs 
for the second time, managing special projects 
such as publishing and editing the Landmark 
L.A.: Historic-Cultural Monuments of Los An-
geles and acting as the liaison with local 
agencies. In 2004, Jeffrey became the curator 
of the world-famous Hollyhock House, where 
he capably oversaw its preservation and inter-
pretation. The 1921 residence, commissioned 
by Aline Barnsdall as a cultural arts complex, 
was designed by renowned architect Frank 
Lloyd Wright with Ms. Barnsdall’s favorite flow-
er, the hollyhock, incorporated into the home’s 
design. In 2019, under Mr. Herr’s leadership, 
the Hollyhock House became a UNESCO 
World Heritage Site, as one of the eight Frank 
Lloyd Wright sites in the world. In addition to 
his work at the Hollyhock House, Jeffrey is 
also the Curator of The Watts Towers, a Na-
tional Historic Landmark, where he directs its 
preservation and conservation. 
Jeffrey Herr was born and raised in East 
Berlin, Pennsylvania and moved to Los Ange-
les in 1987. He completed his BA in English 
Literature in 1972 at Azusa Pacific University 
and MA with Honors in Art History in 1988 at 
California State University, Northridge. Jeffrey 
and his husband, Christopher Molinar have 
lived the Los Angeles neighborhood of Silver 
Lake for the past 27 years. 
I ask all Members of Congress to join me in 
congratulating Jeffrey Herr for three decades 
of outstanding service with the City of Los An-
geles.

RECOGNIZING 
HERMAN 
FLORA 
FOR OBTAINING THE RANK OF 
EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. WM. LACY CLAY 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, in the midst of 
racial segregation in the 1950s, many Black 
Americans were forced to forego opportunities 
and achievements they rightfully earned and 
deserved. One such instance was finally made 
right this past February when Herman Flora 
was recognized with the long-awaited honor of 
becoming an Eagle Scout. 
Mr. Flora joined the Boy Scouts when he 
was a child in 1943. Unfortunately, he was 
prevented from becoming an Eagle Scout be-
cause he lived in a Virginia community where 
Blacks were routinely barred from public swim-
ming pools, which thereby prevented him from 
earning the swimming merit badge that was 
required of all Eagle Scouts. 
Mr. Flora did not let that missed opportunity 
stop him from being active in his community. 
He remained committed to the lessons he 
learned during his time as a Boy Scout. He 
continued to engage in community service, 
pursued higher education, and went on to en-
list in the U,Army before graduating from How-
ard University. 
Stories such as Mr. Flora’s must be recog-
nized and honored for how they shed light on 
our history, and the individuals who have over-
come and prospered in the face of systemic 
racism.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
and 
applaud 
Aikoe 
Prindavong for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Aikoe Prindavong is a student at Three 
Creeks K–8 and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Aikoe 
Prindavong is exemplary of the type of 
achievement that can be attained with hard 
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Aikoe Prindavong for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

CONGRATULATING JOE SAMUELS 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary career of 
Joe Samuels, a pivotal member of the West 
Michigan Steelcase security team. I would like 
to express my appreciation to Mr. Samuels for 
over 33 years of dedicated service to 
Steelcase. 
Mr. 
Samuels’ 
distinguished 
career 
at 
Steelcase began on August 11, 1986. Begin-
ning in the Panel plant, he later continued his 
faithful work in both Systems 1 and Systems 
2 in Materials and Paint. In 2004, Mr. Samuels 
transitioned to the security team and obtained 
his Emergency Medical Technician license. 
Since that time, he has diligently covered both 
Steelcase’s Global Security Operations Center 
and its Grand Rapids Field Operations. 
Outside of work, Mr. Samuels is a dedicated 
and proud father of three—one of whom works 
alongside him in Steelcase Security. In 2018, 
in an incredible demonstration of his selfless 
character and his love for his children, Mr. 
Samuels donated one of his kidneys to his 
son. Having recovered well from the surgery, 
he looks forward to spending his well-earned 
retirement with his children and three grand-
children. 
It is because of the faithful hard work, sac-
rifice, and dedication of community members 
such as Joe Samuels that I am especially 
proud to serve Michigan’s 2nd Congressional 
District. Madam Speaker, I would like to again 
formally congratulate Mr. Samuels on his well- 
deserved retirement.

JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES V. 
RUSSO 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to remind my colleagues of what is at stake at 
the Supreme Court in the coming weeks. 
Yesterday, the Court began to hear argu-
ments in a major abortion rights case, June 
Medical Services v. Russo. 
If the Louisiana law in question goes into ef-
fect, only one clinic remains in the entire state. 
Only one physician would continue to pro-
vide abortions to the 10,000 women in Lou-
isiana who sought them every year. 
That outcome would deny thousands of 
women in Louisiana their constitutional protec-
tion, the protected rights to access abortion 
care. 
ln 2016, the Court already decided that an 
identical case was unconstitutional. 
But since President Trump has added two 
conservative justices to the Supreme Court,

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
ROBERT L. DEHN 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of an extraordinary American, 
Robert L. Dehn, affectionately known to all as 
Bob. 
Bob was born on November 6, 1941, and 
passed away on January 23, 2020, after a 
brief illness. He was the son of Leslie and 
Lorna Dehn of Albany, California, growing up 
in Albany and Berkeley. He graduated from 
UC Berkeley with a degree in chemistry. 
After graduation, Bob began his career at 
SRI International, formerly Stanford Research 
Institute. His first position at SRI was as a 
pharmaceutical chemist, and later, after earn-
ing an MBA from Santa Clara University, he 
moved to marketing and business develop-
ment. He continued in these roles in the Life 
Sciences Division until his retirement in 2007. 
Bob Dehn spent his entire career at SRI 
and it was there that he met his wife of 52 
years, Fran McGroary. He is survived by Fran 
and their daughter, Elizabeth and son Peter, 
and their grandsons Oliver, Byron and Zac, 
and his sister Marlene. 
Fran and Bob have been known and re-
spected throughout the Menlo Park Commu-
nity for their countless contributions. Both 
have given generously of their time and con-
siderable talents in service to others. Bob 
served on the Menlo Park Library Commission 
for 11 years, and helped engineer the pas-
sage of a bond measure that provided funding 
for renovating the main library in 1992. He vol-
unteered extensively at Church of the Nativity 
and its Nativity School. Bob was a man of 
deep faith and he gave his time to St. Antho-
ny’s Padua Dining Room, serving as volunteer 
coordinator, cook’s assistant and fundraising 
director. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the ex-
traordinary life of Bob Dehn and in extending 
our condolences to his wife and his entire 
family. We are a better community and a 
stronger country because of all that Bob did 
for so many.

COACH ROBERT MAXWELL HER-

HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 9, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
the life of Robert Maxwell Herring. 
Herring, best known to most as Coach, 
passed away on March 3rd, a day shy of his 
80th birthday. 
Coach was a letterman in four sports in high 
school and went on to play football, basketball 
and baseball at Mississippi College. He fin-
ished his undergraduate degree at Mississippi 
State. 
He began his coaching career in 1969 in 
Birmingham, moving later to North Alabama 
and then to his hometown in Mississippi. He 
won two private school state football titles in 
1975 and 1983. 
In 1985, Coach Herring took the head 
coaching job at Oxford High School in Oxford, 
Alabama. Over the next 14 years, he created 
a football powerhouse. He won three Class 5A 
state titles in 1988, 1989 and 1993. Herring 
retired under the Alabama system in 1998 and 
went on to be the head coach at Newnan High 
School in Georgia. In 2001, he was elected to 
the Alabama High School Athletic Association 
Hall of Fame and in 2012, he was inducted in 
the Calhoun County’s Sports Hall of Fame. 
He was selected as Coach of the Year in 
Calhoun County by his peers in 1986, 1988, 
1991, 1993 and 1998. In 1993, he was named 
Coach of the Year for Class 5A by the Ala-
bama Sports Writers Association. He retired 
from coaching after the 2008 season. 
Coach Herring was a Christian man devoted 
to his family and married to the love of his life, 
Gail Edmondson Herring. They were blessed 
with four children: Reagan, Randa, Robert and 
Ryan. He was ‘‘Big Dad’’ to seven grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the life of Coach Robert Herring and his 
service and dedication to young athletes for 
40 years. He will be greatly missed.
