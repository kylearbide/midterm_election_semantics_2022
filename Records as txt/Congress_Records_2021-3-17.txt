Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2021 
No. 50 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal and loving God, we pray Your 
blessing on us this day. In our duties, 
give us courage to press on with hearts 
open to emulating the forbearance and 
sacrifice You have demonstrated in 
Your steadfast love for us and for this 
world. 
As brothers and sisters of Your cre-
ation, we pray the faith to leave behind 
all that has kept us from living into 
this Your gracious plan. And as we 
strain toward what is ahead, toward 
the goal of a higher calling, we pray 
Your favor. 
May all who trust in You receive this 
Your benediction on today’s journey: 
May the raindrops fall lightly on 
your brow. 
May the soft winds freshen your spir-
it. 
May the sunshine brighten your 
heart. 
May the burdens of the day rest 
lightly upon you. 
And may God enfold you in the man-
tle of His love. 
We offer ourselves to You, praying in 
the strength of Your name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. MRVAN led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
GUARANTEE WOMEN EQUALITY 
(Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I stand in favor of re-
moving the deadline for the ratifica-
tion of the equal rights amendment, 
and I ask the following question: What 
do the following women have in com-
mon? 
Teacher 
Melissa 
Falkowski, 
who 
saved 19 children during the massacre 
at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High 
School; 
Senator TAMMY DUCKWORTH, who lost 
both her legs in a combat mission in 
Iraq; 
Chemist Alice Ball, who revolution-
ized the treatment for leprosy; 
Joy Harjo, who was the first Native 
American poet laureate; 
Dolores Huerta, civil rights activist; 
The nearly 9 out of 10 nurses and two- 
thirds of the workers at grocery store 
checkouts and fast-food counters who 
are women. 
What do they have in common? No 
matter the sacrifice or contribution to 
society, if you are a woman or a girl in 
the United States of America, you are 
not guaranteed equality under the law. 
After 245 years since the birth of our 
Nation, it is time to pass the equal 
rights amendment. 
REDEVELOPING ABANDONED MINE 
LAND 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 
my colleague, Mr. MATT CARTWRIGHT, 
once again as cosponsor on the RE-
CLAIM Act. This bipartisan legislation 
focuses on reauthorizing the abandoned 
mine land fund, or the AML fund. 
My district, Pennsylvania 15, has the 
most abandoned coal mines in the 
country, and reauthorizing the AML 
fund will provide opportunities and 
funding to clean up the abandoned 
land, not just in my district, but across 
the Nation. 
Coal mining built America. It pow-
ered us onto the world’s stage. It 
helped us win two world wars and 
brought our Nation into the modern 
era. 
The AML is set to expire this year. 
While we continue to make progress on 
environmental restoration, reauthor-
izing the fund is crucial to support 
clean-up efforts and spur economic de-
velopment. 
Madam Speaker, Congress has a 
great opportunity to do right by Penn-
sylvania and other great coal mining 
States by reauthorizing the abandoned 
mine land fund, which is not funded by 
tax dollars but by a fee that has been 
placed on every ton of coal mined since 
1977. Those moneys are sitting there in 
the Federal Treasury, and we need to 
reauthorize that abandoned mine land 
fund to further the redevelopment of 
the scars of the water and the land in 
those abandoned lands.

ENSURING EQUALITY FOR WOMEN

given permission to address the House

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1418 
March 17, 2021 
drafted since 1950 has the equivalent of 
the equal rights amendment, except 
the United States of America. 
Though some might say otherwise, it 
is clear that women need the equal 
rights amendment, and we need it now. 
We need the ERA to strengthen the 
movement women have been building 
to achieve paycheck fairness and paid 
family leave, to prevent discrimination 
against women who are pregnant in the 
workplace, and to fight for comprehen-
sive reproductive health for all women 
and girls. 
Today, I will vote for the equal rights 
amendment to assure that my grand-
daughters, 
that 
women 
and 
girls 
throughout the world and throughout 
the country, are not only strong, pow-
erful, and resilient, but also equal here 
in the United States under the Con-
stitution. 
f 
HONORING CONNIE LAWSON 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor Indiana Secretary of 
State Connie Lawson. 
Since 2012, Connie has overseen Indi-
ana’s elections and modernized how 
Hoosiers and businesses interact with 
the State. Connie championed com-
prehensive election reforms that in-
cluded election security and expanded 
our voting access for Hoosiers. 
Connie is a fierce advocate for Hoo-
siers to be financially literate and has 
advocated high schools offer a free fi-
nancial class to all students. 
Connie modernized State government 
departments by implementing an effi-
cient one-stop portal for businesses to 
register, file, report, and make pay-
ments to State agencies. 
Prior to being secretary of state, 
Connie served 16 years in the Indiana 
State Senate and, before that, was 
clerk of the Hendricks County Circuit 
Court. 
I congratulate Connie on her retire-
ment. On behalf of all Hoosiers, we will 
miss your 33 years of dedicated public 
service. 
f 
SUPPORTING IMMIGRANT 
FARMWORKERS 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of our Nation’s im-
migrants, the farmworkers who toil in 
our fields to feed us, and our Dreamers, 
the exceptional young people who are 
the promise and future of America. 
Our immigration laws should reflect 
our shared values as a Nation, espe-
cially the importance of keeping fami-
lies and communities together. 
In my district in Ventura County, 
California, agriculture is a cornerstone 
of our regional economy. Immigrant 
farmworkers are essential to putting 
food on America’s table. 
Because of the essential role farm-
workers play in our economy and our 
communities, I support the creation of 
an earned pathway to citizenship. 
I also stand with our Dreamers, many 
of whom have known no other home 
than the United States. Dreamers are 
the 
embodiment 
of 
the 
American 
Dream. Dreamers represent the very 
best of our country, and they are real-
izing their fullest potential. Their suc-
cess is America’s success. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization 
Act 
and 
the 
American 
Dream and Promise Act. 
f 
HONORING JOEL BENSON 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise to honor an august leader 
within my hometown community in 
western North Carolina, a proven en-
trepreneur and a great business leader 
who is about to open a second quick- 
service 
restaurant 
in 
my 
district, 
which will employ over 100 people. 
Not only will this restaurant employ 
100 people, this restaurant will also 
feed 100 families. This restaurant will 
help house 100 families. 
Not only will these employees get to 
have the honor of being able to earn a 
living to provide for their families, but 
they will also be under the careful tu-
telage of their new employer, Joel Ben-
son, who everyone in my community 
will recognize is one of the most influ-
ential people in my district. Joel is ex-
cellent at maximizing the potential in 
everyone in his care and in his sphere 
of influence. 
Today, I rise to honor a great mentor 
of mine and a great business leader 
who is providing jobs and a strong 
economy to North Carolina, Joel Ben-
son. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Benson 
for his service to our community. 
f 
HONORING WOMEN OF STEEL 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in observance of Women’s His-
tory Month to honor Women of Steel, 
an advocacy-arm of the United Steel-
workers. 
Throughout the years, women from 
diverse backgrounds have played an in-
strumental role in paving the way for 
women in the steel industry. 
Among these remarkable leaders was 
Ola Kennedy, a resident of Gary, Indi-
ana, who worked for 28 years at Ham-
mond Valve. A devoted community 
leader, Ola was involved in many union 
and civic organizations and was one of 
the founding members of the Coalition 
of Black Trade Unionists. 
I also want to celebrate Roberta 
Wood who, along with Ola, cofounded 
the steelworker women’s caucus in the 
Chicago-Gary district of the Steel-
workers union. In 1976, Roberta was 
elected the first female member of the 
USWA Local 65’s executive board and is 
currently a member of the Steel-
workers Organization of Active Retir-
ees. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to cel-
ebrate Women’s History Month and 
recognize the role Women of Steel have 
played to organize, unionize, rally, and 
inspire workers to fight for justice. 
These extraordinary women continue 
to be fearless, strong, and vocal advo-
cates for more women in leadership and 
carry on the march to fight for full 
gender equality in the workplace. I 
commend these women. 
f 
PROTECTING SURVIVORS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to say how honored I am to be 
able to file two amendments to the 
critical reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act. 
My first amendment aims to protect 
the safety and privacy of survivors by 
creating a statutory mandate that a 
victim’s safety should be central to 
housing decisions made by covered 
housing providers. This amendment 
will ensure that housing providers do 
not evict survivors, keep their informa-
tion confidential, and prioritize their 
safety when considering admissions, 
assistance, transfers, and more. 
My second amendment is a direct re-
sponse to an issue in my home State of 
North Carolina. Sexual assault nurse 
examiners, or SANE nurses, play a 
critical role in providing medical care 
to sexual assault survivors and col-
lecting evidence for criminal prosecu-
tion. 
Unfortunately, in North Carolina, 
SANE nurses can be difficult to locate, 
and some survivors travel to multiple 
hospitals and have to wait hours to see 
a SANE nurse. My amendment allows 
certain grants in the bill to be used to 
create databases.

ST. PATRICK’S DAY IN SAVANNAH 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize St. 
Patrick’s Day in Savannah, Georgia. 
The first St. Patrick’s Day parade in 
Savannah began in 1824, and it is now a 
parade that gathers hundreds of thou-
sands of visitors from all over the 
world. 
The second-largest St. Patrick’s Day 
in the United States is important for 
everyone in Savannah, but it is espe-
cially important for the Savannah

Irish community. Savannah has a his-
torically large Irish community that is 
integral to the fabric of the city, and 
the St. Patrick’s Day parade is the di-
rect result of this impact. 
Unfortunately, the parade and elec-
tion of the grand marshal was canceled 
this year due to the pandemic. How-
ever, it is important that we continue 
to celebrate and honor the heritage and 
culture of the Irish. I look forward to 
continuing this special tradition and 
celebrating St. Patrick’s Day in Savan-
nah with everyone once the pandemic 
ends. 
f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, today, we will 
vote 
to 
reauthorize 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act, one of the most 
important bills in history to protect 
women and girls. 
This photograph is of then-Senator 
Joe Biden, myself, and other women 
leaders when we introduced this impor-
tant bill in 1994. It is still important. 
We need to reauthorize it. There is no 
doubt he will sign it into law. 
We live in a world where 1 in 4 
women have experienced sexual vio-
lence. Reauthorizing VAWA is about 
creating a future where all those expe-
riencing dating and gender-based vio-
lence feel supported to seek help, and 
where survivors are given the tools 
they need to heal. It is about ensuring 
a better, safer future for the next gen-
eration. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote by all of 
my colleagues. 
f 
EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
equal rights amendment. 
From the beginning, gender equality 
was left out of the Constitution. Gen-
erations of women and LGBTQ-plus 
Americans lived and died without ever 
having the equal rights and dignity 
that they deserve under the law. 
We know that the ERA is necessary 
by the words of its opponents, includ-
ing the late Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia, who argued that the 
Constitution does not prohibit dis-
crimination based on sex. We can 
change that. 
Madam Speaker, 38 States have rati-
fied the ERA. The only hurdle that re-
mains is the arbitrary deadline set by 
Congress, a deadline that passed before 
I was born, but a deadline that never 
stopped the pursuit of justice. With 
every vote we take in this Chamber, we 
have the chance to correct past mis-
takes and repeal past wrongs. That is 
what we will do again today. 
Madam Speaker, our march for equal 
rights is not done. It will not stop, and 
it does not expire. 
REMOVING 
THE 
DEADLINE 
FOR 
THE 
RATIFICATION 
OF 
THE 
EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 233, I call up 
the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 17) re-
moving the deadline for the ratifica-
tion of the equal rights amendment, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BEATTY). Pursuant to House Resolution 
233, the joint resolution is considered 
read. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
H.J. RES. 17 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That notwithstanding 
any time limit contained in House Joint Res-
olution 208, 92d Congress, as agreed to in the 
Senate on March 22, 1972, the article of 
amendment proposed to the States in that 
joint resolution shall be valid to all intents 
and purposes as part of the United States 
Constitution whenever ratified by the legis-
latures of three-fourths of the several States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution shall be debatable for 
one hour, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 
17. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, H.J. Res. 17 is long- 
overdue legislation to ensure that the 
equal rights amendment can finally be-
come the 28th Amendment to the 
United States Constitution. The House 
passed identical legislation last Con-
gress on a bipartisan basis, and I hope 
it will do so again today. 
Madam Speaker, in 1923, Alice Paul 
first introduced an amendment to the 
Constitution to guarantee full equal 
protection for women. The text of the 
amendment 
is 
simple 
and 
clear: 
‘‘Equality of rights under the law shall 
not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any State on account of 
sex.’’ 
That amendment passed with over-
whelming bipartisan majorities in the 
House and Senate in 1972. 
Unfortunately, it fell just short of 
being ratified by the requisite number 
of States before the arbitrary deadline 
imposed by Congress ran out in 1982. In 
the 40 years since, we have made great 
strides in this country to ensure equal-
ity. Women have secured the right to 
vote, protection against workplace dis-
crimination, and through case law de-
cided 
under 
the 
14th 
Amendment, 
many other critical protections denied 
them for too long on the basis of sex. 
Without the ERA, millions of women 
have still had to march in support of 
their rights, their healthcare, their re-
productive freedom and abortion ac-
cess, and their dignity as equal citi-
zens. Through the Me Too movement, 
we have had long-overdue, and some-
times painful, conversations about the 
violence and harassment that women 
and others experience—whether in the 
workplace, at homes, or in schools and 
universities. 
But still, to this day, the Constitu-
tion does not explicitly recognize and 
guarantee that no one can be denied 
equal protection of the laws on the 
basis of sex. The ERA would enshrine 
those principles and take the final, 
critical step of ensuring that laws 
disadvantaging women and gender mi-
norities are subject to the most rig-
orous form of scrutiny. 
Last year, Virginia became the 38th 
and last necessary State to ratify the 
ERA, and, today, in passing H.J. Res. 
17, we will be one step closer to en-
shrining it into law. This resolution re-
moves a previous deadline Congress set 
in the amendment’s proposing clause 
for ratifying the ERA, and will, there-
fore, ensure that recent ratifications 
by Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia are 
given full effect. 
We are on the brink of making his-
tory, and no deadline should stand in 
the way. The Constitution itself places 
no deadlines on the process for ratify-
ing amendments. Congress, just as 
clearly, has the authority to extend or 
remove any deadlines that it pre-
viously chose to set in the first place. 
The recent ruling by the United 
States District Court for the District 
of Columbia refusing to recognize the 
recent State ratifications makes it 
even more imperative that Congress 
act now in removing this deadline. We 
must make it absolutely clear that 
Congress does not want language put in 
the proposing clause of a resolution 40 
years ago to stand in the way of full 
equality now. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive SPEIER for introducing this resolu-
tion, which takes that important step. 
This resolution will ensure, at long 
last, that the equal rights amendment 
can take its rightful place as part of 
our Nation’s Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support it, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from New York for yielding. 
H.J. Res. 17 is not a resolution to re-
vive the equal rights amendment; it is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1420 
March 17, 2021 
a messaging vehicle. That is why 
Democrats bypassed the Committee on 
the Judiciary and brought this resolu-
tion directly to the floor, a common 
theme for this majority. There was no 
process for this resolution, a resolution 
that Democrats claim is a priority. We 
are here today for a headline so the 
Democrats can say they supported the 
ERA when it was in the House. 
But the fact is, Madam Speaker, that 
men and women in the United States 
are already equal under law. The Fifth 
and Fourteenth Amendments to the 
Constitution require as much, guaran-
teeing equal protection for all under 
the laws of this country. To me, the 
ERA is unnecessary, redundant, and di-
visive. The only thing it will do is em-
power 
the 
far-left 
special 
interest 
groups and lead to activist litigation. 
Just last year, the head of Planned 
Parenthood declared: ‘‘There is no 
equal rights for women without access 
to abortion, plain and simple.’’ 
Or according to NARAL Pro-Choice 
America: ‘‘With its ratification, the 
ERA would reinforce the constitutional 
right to abortion.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we should take 
them at their word. 
For years, groups like Planned Par-
enthood and others have advocated for 
adoption of the ERA so they can use it 
to pursue their pro-abortion agendas. If 
the ERA became law, it would allow 
these organizations to advance the rad-
ical policies through the courts with-
out being in full view of the American 
people. These groups have hijacked the 
ERA and are seeking to use it as a tool 
to challenge States’ pro-life laws. 
But the reality is that this resolution 
is unconstitutional. Article V of the 
Constitution empowers Congress to 
propose amendments to the Constitu-
tion by a two-thirds vote of both the 
House and the Senate. After Congress 
proposes an amendment, the amend-
ment is sent to the States for ratifica-
tion. Three-fourths of the States must 
ratify the amendment in order for it to 
become effective. 
The equal rights amendment was pro-
posed in 1972. The amendment set an 
explicit deadline. It gave the States 7 
years, until 1979, for ratification. Set-
ting a deadline for ratification is part 
of Congress’ authority to determine 
the mode of ratification under Article 
V. 
In 1920, the Supreme Court held in 
Dillon v. Gloss that there was no doubt 
that Congress can set a date for ratify-
ing an amendment. The deadline to 
ratify the ERA has long since passed, 
and the amendment fell short of the re-
quired number of States. When pro-
posing a constitutional amendment, 
the deadline for ratification is just as 
important as the substance. 
The District Court for D.C., less than 
2 weeks ago, denied an effort by Vir-
ginia, Nevada, and Illinois to force the 
adoption of the ERA, despite the 1979 
deadline. In denying the effort of those 
States, the courts said that a deadline 
for ratification still receives the assent 
of two-thirds of both Houses of Con-
gress, and putting it in the resolving 
clause does not evade Article V’s proce-
dural requirements in any way. 
Because setting a deadline takes a 
two-thirds vote of Congress, it would 
be absurd to say that changing that 
deadline requires anything less. If a 
simple majority of Congress could alter 
a proposed amendment after it has 
been sent to the States, the two-thirds 
requirement of Article V would be 
meaningless. 
A partisan majority cannot rewrite a 
proposed amendment at will after there 
has been an agreement in Congress. 
However, that is just what H.J. Res. 17 
and the Democrats propose to do. 
The ERA expired in 1979, and this 
joint resolution is a legal fiction ad-
vanced for political purposes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to oppose this resolution. 
b 1030 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, the 
gentlewoman errs, the deadline for 
ratification is not part of the amend-
ment, it is part of the resolution pro-
posing the amendment. And if Congress 
can propose a deadline, it can revoke 
that proposal since it is not part of the 
amendment at all. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, this is 
a glorious day for women in America. 
With the passage of the ERA and the 
Violence Against Women Act, we are 
making great strides forward. 
This particular resolution does one 
thing. We want in the Constitution, 
plain and simple. 
Antonin Scalia, the great jurist, said 
once: Does the Constitution require 
discrimination based on sex? The an-
swer is no. 
But if the question is: Does the Con-
stitution prohibit discrimination based 
on sex? 
The answer is also no. 
That should send a chilling feeling in 
each of us that in the Constitution of 
the United States women are not pro-
tected. 
In fact, we are the only country with 
a written Constitution that does not 
prohibit discrimination based on sex. 
Shame on us. 
There can be no expiration date on 
equality. This is a bipartisan bill. We 
are proud to bring it to the floor. 
My colleagues across the aisle may 
say we don’t need the ERA, women are 
already equal under the law, that it is 
redundant. 
Well, tell that to Christy Brzonkala, 
who was raped by two football players 
at Virginia Tech. She sought justice 
under VAWA, but the Supreme Court 
struck down the civil suit provision, 
claiming Congress lacked the power to 
pass it. 
Or Tracy Rexroat, whose starting 
salary at the Arizona Department of 
Education was $17,000 less than her col-
league. They based the salaries on 
what their prior salary was from what-
ever job they came, so she receives 
$17,000 less than her colleague. She too 
filed an action under the Equal Pay 
Act, and the courts held that there was 
some reasonable expectation. 
Well, there is nothing reasonable 
about that. And until we have the ERA 
in the Constitution that provides the 
same level of scrutiny as race discrimi-
nation, this will continue to be a prob-
lem. 
Or ask Jessica Gonzales if she thinks 
it is redundant. Jessica’s estranged 
husband kidnapped and murdered their 
three young daughters after the police 
refused to enforce a restraining order. 
If we had the ERA, these cases would 
have had different outcomes. The ERA 
will create stronger legal recourse 
against sex discrimination, it will em-
power Congress to better enforce and 
enact laws protecting women, and it 
will confirm the rightful place of gen-
der equality in the Constitution where 
it belongs. 
I believe most of us recognize that 
this is the right thing to do. The ERA 
is about building an America that we 
want. It is about forming a more per-
fect union, it is about equality, sur-
vival, dignity, and respect. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, some lawmakers continue to 
ignore, trivialize, or deny the fact that 
abortion activists plan to aggressively 
use the Federal ERA—as they have 
used State ERAs—in a litigation strat-
egy designed to overturn pro-life laws 
and policies, including restrictions sup-
ported by huge majorities of Ameri-
cans. 
As the Marist Poll found recently in 
January: Seven in 10 Americans, in-
cluding nearly half who identify as pro- 
choice, want significant restrictions on 
abortions. While I fundamentally dis-
agree with abortion activists who 
refuse to recognize an unborn child’s 
inherent dignity, worth and value, 
many on both sides now agree that how 
the ERA is written will be used in 
court to massively promote abortion. 
NARAL Pro-Choice America said the 
ERA would ‘‘reinforce the constitu-
tional right to abortion’’ and ‘‘require 
judges to strike down anti-abortion 
laws.’’ 
The 
National 
Organization 
for 
Women said: ‘‘An ERA—properly inter-
preted—could negate the hundreds of 
laws that have been passed restricting 
access to abortion. . . .’’ 
Those laws include the Hyde amend-
ment, waiting periods, parental in-
volvement statutes, women’s right-to- 
know laws, conscience rights, and late 
term abortion ban, like the Partial- 
Birth Abortion Ban Act. 
By now, my colleagues know that the 
Supreme Court of New Mexico ruled 
that the State was required—required 
to fund abortion, based solely on the 
State ERA. 
In like manner, the Supreme Court of 
Connecticut invalidated its State ban 
on abortion funding based on its ERA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1421 
March 17, 2021 
Ensuring equal rights for women and 
serious protections against violence 
and exploitation requires laws, poli-
cies, and spending priorities to achieve 
those noble and necessary goals, with-
out—I say again, without putting un-
born baby girls and boys at risk of 
death. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
glad the gentleman recognizes that 
equality includes the right of each 
woman and man to make their own de-
cision about their reproductive choices. 
There can be no equality of the sexes 
when one class of people is denied the 
ability to control their own bodies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate this 
Women’s History Month by reflecting 
on the achievement of so many women 
who have blazed a trail for the genera-
tions that followed them; women who 
didn’t listen when they were told that 
they couldn’t, they shouldn’t, or that 
they didn’t belong. 
American women have fought for the 
right to vote, the right to equal edu-
cation, 
the 
right 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare, and the right to financially 
provide for our families and be com-
pensated the same as men. And we will 
continue these fights until our Con-
stitution declares that women are 
equal in the eyes of the law. 
It is time for full constitutional 
equality. The American people over-
whelmingly support this bipartisan leg-
islation. I am proud to vote for it again 
today in honor of the generations of 
women that have made strides toward 
equality. I know that we will soon 
achieve it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I 
think it is a good discussion to have, 
but I would suggest to my colleagues 
from the other side, if they do believe 
this issue is still valid and necessary, 
to actually restart this process from 
the beginning, because we are wasting 
our time right here. A 1972 amendment 
cannot be ratified, it doesn’t exist. It 
has expired. It is unconstitutional. A 
lot of things have changed. 
We can debate if it is necessary or 
not, but if we want to have a real de-
bate, we need to restart this from the 
beginning and not waste time debating 
something that doesn’t exist. So I 
would ask not to support this amend-
ment, and it is unconstitutional. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank the chairman for his time, 
and I want to thank Mrs. MALONEY and 
Ms. SPEIER for their long work on this, 
and the many women before them who 
have worked hard on this effort. 
Congress created the limitation on 
years on the passage of the ERA, and 
Congress can change it, and Congress 
should change it. 
I am the product of the work of a 
woman, my mother, and her mother 
produced her. We should not forget 
women and their commitment and in-
valuable contributions at our birth. 
Every woman should have the same 
rights as a man. They don’t get paid 
the same, they are discriminated in the 
workplace, they are harassed, they are 
abused. They should have equal rights. 
That has not occurred in America, and 
it won’t happen until we pass this bill. 
I favor the passage and I appreciate 
the spirit in which it is offered. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this bill. This push to 
remove the deadline for ratification of 
the Equal Rights Amendment is an un-
necessary and unconstitutional power- 
grab. 
This bill is unconstitutional. Con-
gress set a deadline for the ERA; it was 
1979. With only 35 of the 38 States need-
ed for ratification at the time, Con-
gress extended the deadline to 1982, but 
no other States joined in, ending the 
ratification process for the equal rights 
amendment. 
Even the late Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the 
deadline for the ERA ratification had 
long passed. She said: ‘‘I would like to 
see a new beginning. I’d like it to start 
over. There’s too much controversy 
about latecomers—Virginia, long after 
the deadline passed. Plus, a number of 
States have withdrawn their ratifica-
tion. So, if you count a latecomer on 
the plus side, how can you disregard 
States that said, ‘‘We’ve changed our 
minds?’’’ If my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle want to ratify the 
ERA, they have to start over. 
Women 
also 
already 
have 
equal 
rights under the law. In decision after 
decision, the United States Supreme 
Court has underscored that the 14th 
Amendment to the United States Con-
stitution gives women equal rights and 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
sex, rendering, I believe, the ERA un-
necessary. 
Finally, if ratified, the ERA would be 
used to codify the right to abortion, 
undoing pro-life protections, and forc-
ing taxpayers to fund abortions. 
The New Mexico Supreme Court 
ruled that their State’s ERA provision 
required the State to fund abortions. 
Numerous pro-abortion groups have al-
ready made the case for ratifying the 
ERA on the basis of expanding their 
abortion agenda. Just listen to the 
words of the organizations pushing this 
legislation themselves. 
The National Abortion and Reproduc-
tive Rights Action League, NARAL, 
has claimed that, ‘‘With its ratifica-
tion, the ERA would reinforce the con-
stitutional right to abortion.’’ 
Planned Parenthood and the Wom-
en’s Law Project has said that State 
bans and government funding of elec-
tive abortions are ‘‘contrary to a mod-
ern understanding of the ERA.’’ 
The 
National 
Organization 
for 
Women has said, ‘‘An ERA—properly 
interpreted—could negate the hundreds 
of laws that have been passed restrict-
ing access to abortion care and contra-
ception.’’ 
With this unconstitutional bill, my 
colleagues across the aisle are hiding 
behind the rhetoric of equality for 
women to eliminate any and all protec-
tions for unborn babies, half of which 
would be girls, then women, if given 
the chance to live. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill. 
b 1045 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) 
that he may control that time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Tennessee will control the 
time. 
Mr. COHEN. Unlike Alexander Haig, I 
am only here temporarily. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY), who is from the 
East Side and who, as chairperson, 
brought us the great hearing last year 
on the ERA. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, there is no time 
limit on equality. The equal rights 
amendment 
passed 
the 
needed 
38 
States, including the great State of 
New York. Enough is enough. It is long 
past time for women to be in the Con-
stitution. 
We may not always be able to con-
trol, nor should women’s rights be de-
pendent upon who controls State gov-
ernments, who is in the White House or 
Congress, or who sits on the Supreme 
Court. 
Our rights shouldn’t be determined 
by these types of things. It should be in 
the document, the document they in-
terpret and that they are bound by. 
It is long past time to spell out 
equality in our Constitution with the 
ERA. 
Unfortunately, we are seeing the ef-
fects of gender inequality acutely dur-
ing this pandemic. An estimated 1 mil-
lion more women than men have lost 
their jobs, and a disproportionate num-
ber of those suffering are Black women 
and Latinas. 
We need to pass it. It is urgently 
needed. Let’s just imagine if the ERA 
had been ratified in the 1970s, as it 
should have been. 
Would we have needed today a dra-
matic Me Too, Time’s Up movement 
with hundreds of thousands of women 
having to tell their often painful per-
sonal stories in order to get justice? 
Or 
would 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act and other legislation ad-
dressing 
sexual 
assault 
have 
been 
passed, if it had been passed much 
sooner, without the risk of a Supreme 
Court ruling limiting a woman’s right 
to sue? Women could sue directly if 
they were in the Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1422 
March 17, 2021 
We have the opportunity to make 
equal rights under the law a reality for 
our mothers, our daughters, our grand-
daughters, and ourselves. We must rec-
ognize that there is no time limit on 
equality and vote to pass today’s reso-
lution now. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Would 
the gentlewoman please pull her mask 
up. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER), 
who is the chairman of the committee, 
that he may control that time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will control the balance of the 
time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, discrimi-
nation against women is a part of 
America’s history, but it should not be 
our future. That is why we need the 
equal rights amendment. 
It was not an accident that women 
were left out of the Constitution. The 
Founders very much believed us to be 
unequal and, as such, we could not own 
property, vote, hold certain jobs, or 
even serve on a jury. 
The impacts of that discrimination 
are still felt today. Women are paid 
less than men and still face discrimina-
tion for being pregnant. 
The Founders were wrong, and this is 
our chance to fix it by doing what they 
refused to do: assert in the Constitu-
tion that women, too, have rights. 
The ERA will not end discrimination, 
but it will empower us to fight it in 
court. Already, 38 States have ratified 
this amendment, which satisfies the re-
quirements in the Constitution. The 
vast majority of Americans support it. 
Congress set a deadline for ratifica-
tion, which means we can repeal it. It 
is time to affirm that there is no expi-
ration date on equality. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, the language of the equal 
rights amendment is simple, but don’t 
be deceived by its simple language. 
The reviving of the deadline and rati-
fying of this amendment would destroy 
all 
distinctions 
between 
men 
and 
women, enshrine abortion, and em-
power the woke feminist mob. 
The equal rights amendment is dead 
and should remain dead. The States 
and Congress missed the deadline to 
have the amendment passed in 1979. 
The Trump Department of Justice 
issued a legal opinion in January that 
the deadline for the ERA has already 
passed, by any legal measure. 
The ERA would be a new constitu-
tional right guaranteeing abortion on 
demand. Have we not murdered enough 
people in the womb in this country, 
over 62 million? 
Guaranteeing abortion on demand is 
completely wrong. It is not a constitu-
tional right. As a matter of fact, the 
person in the womb should have the 
constitutional right. It is not a ‘‘my 
body, my choice’’ issue because the 
person in the womb is not the same 
body as the woman. 
Also, NARAL Pro-Choice America 
claims: ‘‘With its ratification, the ERA 
would 
reinforce 
the 
constitutional 
right to abortion.’’ 
If anything, we should be guaran-
teeing a constitutional right to people 
in the womb. They should have the 
constitutional right to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. 
Let’s carry on. VAWA, Violence 
Against Women Act. Democrats have 
hijacked a program designed to help 
marginalized women and have turned it 
into a political weapon that erases gen-
der and destroys all religious freedom. 
On the wall right here, it says: In 
God We Trust. God states that He cre-
ated male and female, not a plethora of 
genders that anyone can choose from. 
They want to let men calling them-
selves women sleep with women in do-
mestic abuse shelters. The Democrats 
will not be satisfied until every bat-
tered woman is endangered so long as 
their sexual orientation and gender 
identity ideology advances. 
That is not science. Science says that 
there are only two genders, male and 
female, according to the chromosomes. 
Make no mistake about it, Demo-
crats want to destroy our country. 
They want to close every church and 
nonprofit that doesn’t capitulate to 
their oppressive agenda. Democrats 
want to put domestic violence abusers 
in the same room as their victims. 
Democrats want to dissolve all sex- 
based protection for women and girls 
through the relentless onslaught of 
gender identity. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, every 
amendment since the 22nd, except for 
the 27th, has had a deadline for ratifi-
cation inserted in the resolution. But if 
you look at the Constitution, Madam 
Speaker, you won’t find the deadline. 
That is because the deadline is part of 
the congressional resolution proposing 
the amendment, not part of the amend-
ment itself. 
What Congress can propose, Congress 
can alter, which is all we are proposing 
to do today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. It is 
wonderful to see Members of Congress 
wearing white today to observe the 
fact that we are making history by 
passing legislation about equality in 
our country. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
JACKIE 
SPEIER for her relentless championing 
of this equal rights amendment in 
terms of the date that the distin-
guished chair of the Judiciary Com-
mittee referenced. I also thank CARO-
LYN MALONEY for her long-term advo-
cacy of the equal rights amendment. I 
thank Chairman NADLER for enabling 
us to have this legislation on the floor 
today and for his leadership on this 
issue over time. 
Madam Speaker, 100 years ago, in 
1921, a solemn promise was made to the 
women of our country, one honoring 
our most fundamental truth as a na-
tion, as the equal rights amendment 
was first introduced. When it was first 
introduced, it said: ‘‘Men and women 
shall have equal rights throughout the 
United States and every place subject 
to its jurisdiction.’’ 
Simple, clear, fair, and just. Yet, a 
century later, that promise remains 
unfulfilled. The equal rights amend-
ment still has not been enshrined in 
the Constitution, and American women 
still face inequality under the law and, 
therefore, in their lives. 
In recent years, American women 
have renewed the legal fight for the 
equal rights amendment. Women of all 
backgrounds—students, mothers, sen-
iors, communities of color, indigenous 
women, et cetera—have taken up the 
mantle of the suffragists before them, 
standing on suffragists’ shoulders as 
they marched, mobilized, protested, 
and picketed for their rights. Because 
of their courage and commitment, 38 
States have now ratified the equal 
rights amendment. 
But one final barrier remains: remov-
ing the artificial, arbitrary time limit 
for ratification. As the distinguished 
chairman pointed out, that deadline 
timetable is not in the Constitution. 
Until we remove that arbitrary time 
limit, the ERA cannot become part of 
our Constitution. 
Last year, the House passed legisla-
tion to remove this arbitrary time 
limit, but unfortunately, the Senate 
failed to do so. So, today, the House 
will, once again, pass this legislation 
and send it to the Senate for a vote. We 
are proud to be doing it in Women’s 
History Month. 
We 
salute 
again 
Congresswoman 
JACKIE SPEIER, our champion on the 
legislation on the floor today, and Con-
gresswoman CAROLYN
MALONEY, who 
has been our lead sponsor of the ERA 
for 25 years now. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Members 
from both sides of the aisle, including 
cosponsor Representative TOM
REED 
from New York, for their bipartisan 
support in the Congress, which reflects 
the overwhelming bipartisan support in 
the country. A full 94 percent of the 
public 
supports 
the 
equal 
rights 
amendment, including 99 percent, near-
ly 
unanimous 
support, 
among 
millennials and Generation Z. 
Let us not forget that, in 1972, the 
equal rights amendment was passed 
with bipartisan supermajorities in both 
Chambers of Congress, and it enjoyed 
the strong support of President Nixon, 
who wrote in 1968 that ‘‘the task of 
achieving constitutional equality be-
tween the sexes is still not completed’’ 
and pointed out that all Republican 
National Conventions since 1940 have

March 17, 2021 
supported the longtime movement for 
equality. 
There is no reason why today, after 
80 years of Republican support, the 
ERA should not have full bipartisan 
support in the Congress. The resolution 
on the floor today will pave the way to 
passage of the equal rights amendment, 
which is one of the most important 
steps that we can take to affirm and 
ensure women’s equality in America. 
The text of the equal rights amend-
ment states: ‘‘Equality of rights under 
the law shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State 
on account of sex.’’ 
‘‘On account of sex’’ recalls to mind 
the beautiful documentary about Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
Passing the equal rights amendment 
will create essential avenues for legal 
recourse for people who face discrimi-
nation under the laws on the basis of 
sex. It will ensure that the Supreme 
Court applies the same standard of re-
view for sex discrimination cases as it 
applies to cases of discrimination based 
on race and national origin. It will help 
Congress pass laws for better legal pro-
tections against injustice, including 
those related to sexual assault, domes-
tic violence, and paycheck unfairness. 
It will confirm the rightful place of 
gender equality in all aspects of life. 
There are some who say that the 
equal rights amendment is not needed. 
To them, I quote the late Justice 
Antonin Scalia, who said: ‘‘Certainly 
the Constitution does not require dis-
crimination on the basis of sex. The 
only issue is whether it prohibits it. It 
does not.’’ 
These are not just words. This is the 
daily reality for America’s women who 
face inequality and injustice in so 
many arenas of life, from a massive 
wage gap, to pregnancy discrimination, 
to sexual harassment in the workplace, 
to economic disparities that have wors-
ened during coronavirus. 
b 1100 
Passing this resolution, and then the 
ERA, will not only help women, but by 
unleashing the full economic potential 
of women, it will help families and 
boost our economy, all while advancing 
justice and equality in America for ev-
eryone. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bi-
partisan vote on this strong step to-
ward equality for women, progress for 
families, and a stronger America—af-
firming the truth, Madam Speaker, 
that you have espoused that when 
women succeed, America succeeds. 
I commend the leadership on this 
issue, the distinguished chairman, and 
the sponsors of the resolution, JACKIE 
SPEIER and CAROLYN MALONEY. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia 
(Mrs. MCBATH) to control the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Georgia will control 
the time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the achieve-
ments women have made and reaffirm 
that we are already equal under cur-
rent law. 
Women represent 51 percent of the 
population, comprise over half of col-
lege students, make up the majority of 
medical and law school students, and 
run 12.3 million women-owned busi-
nesses while generating $1.8 trillion 
each year. 
Little girls can be whatever they 
want to be, whether that is an astro-
naut, a doctor, a full-time mom work-
ing at home, or a Member of Congress. 
The ERA would not add to the rights 
already guaranteed by the 14th Amend-
ment’s Equal Protection Clause, but it 
could jeopardize them. 
How? Two ways. 
First, by making it discriminatory to 
offer benefits to women not offered to 
men; women’s scholarships, women’s 
colleges, job protection for pregnant 
women, and safe spaces may all be on 
the chopping block. 
When the equal rights amendment 
was first proposed a century ago, many 
women’s rights advocates recognized 
the negative ramifications it would 
bring. In fact, future First Lady Elea-
nor Roosevelt expressed concerns that 
legislation protecting women in the 
workplace could be eliminated should 
the ERA become part of the U.S. Con-
stitution. 
Secondly, because the 1972 definition 
of sex as male and female is no longer 
accepted by many today and, instead, 
will require new protections for sexual 
orientation and gender identity. This is 
a path that has already proven to be a 
threat to women’s privacy, safety, and 
equality. Don’t take it from me. Talk 
to the nine women in California who 
were sexually harassed in a women’s 
shelter by a biological male identifying 
as a woman. 
The equal rights amendment would 
not only codify inequality for women, 
but also destroy the rights of the un-
born. The ERA advocates have been un-
equivocal about their support for abor-
tion and for using the ERA to overturn 
pro-life laws. 
Courts 
have 
already 
used 
State 
versions of the ERA to force taxpayers 
to fund abortions. A Federal ERA 
would threaten State pro-life laws, 
Federal protections like the Hyde 
amendment, and conscience protec-
tions for American medical profes-
sionals who may otherwise be forced to 
perform an abortion. 
Fortunately, the time limit to pass 
the ERA expired decades ago, and there 
is agreement that Congress cannot go 
back and remove a deadline from a pre-
vious constitutional amendment initia-
tive. For example, the Supreme Court 
has already recognized that the 1972 
ERA expired, and the Department of 
Justice issued a ruling saying: ‘‘Con-
gress 
may 
not 
revive 
a 
proposed 
amendment after a deadline, for its 
ratification has expired.’’ 
Just over a week ago, a Federal dis-
trict court ruled that the deadline to 
ratify the ERA ‘‘expired long ago.’’ 
And the recent ratifications of the 
amendment 
arrived 
‘‘too 
late 
to 
count.’’ 
Pretending we can remove the dead-
line for passage is both futile and de-
ceptive. The ERA is a threat to the his-
torical strides women have made. It 
will eradicate State and Federal pro- 
life laws and policies, and the process 
is blatantly unconstitutional. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution 
and to, instead, uphold the Constitu-
tion, promote life, and protect women’s 
rights. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), our esteemed 
leader of the House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate 
Women’s History Month, we do so with 
an awareness that so much work in the 
fight for equality remains. Much has 
been accomplished, but much remains 
to be done. This is one of those. 
That is what the House is focusing on 
this week, women’s equality, women’s 
safety and justice, and women’s oppor-
tunity. I am proud that we are taking 
action to reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act within the first 3 
months of the new Congress. 
I was a cosponsor—and proud of it—of 
the original 1994 Violence Against 
Women Act. We passed the original 
VAWA on a bipartisan basis and reau-
thorized it with bipartisan support in 
2000 and again in 2005. Those were over-
whelming votes of 371–1 and 415–4. 
Now we are talking about the equal 
rights amendment, I understand. 
In 2013, we did it again on VAWA, 87 
Republicans joining all 199 Democrats 
in the House vote. Every time we reau-
thorized the law, we made it stronger, 
ensuring protections for more women 
who 
were 
victimized 
by 
domestic 
abuse, stalking, and other crimes. 
Last Congress, our House Democratic 
majority passed a VAWA reauthoriza-
tion that included these expanded pro-
tections, 
but 
Senate 
Republicans 
blocked it from consideration. Not that 
they offered an alternative, not that 
they said: This is a problem and we 
need to solve it. It has been bipartisan, 
so here is our view and we will go to 
conference on it. 
They simply blocked it. 
It is essential, Madam Speaker, that 
Congress take action with a long-term 
reauthorization of VAWA, made all the 
more critical by the rise in domestic 
violence we have seen during the 
COVID–19 pandemic and more people 
having to stay home; an epidemic of 
domestic violence. Let’s send a mes-
sage to the women and men of America 
that Congress will continue to do its 
part to root out domestic violence and 
abuse. 
I was just with Congresswoman JACK-
SON LEE, the sponsor and the chair of 
the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland 
Security 
Subcommittee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1424 
March 17, 2021 
NADLER is now speaking. I said then, as 
I say now: It is critical that we pass 
this legislation. 
I agree with President Biden, the au-
thor of the original 1994 Violence 
Against Women Act, that strength-
ening and renewing VAWA is long past 
due. Once we pass it in the House, I 
hope the Senate will send it quickly to 
President Biden to sign it into law. 
Madam Speaker, I am speaking on 
both VAWA, obviously, and the ERA, 
two very critically important pieces of 
legislation. 
Last year, Virginia became the 38th 
State to ratify the equal rights amend-
ment. When I hear the opposition to 
the 
equal 
rights 
amendment, 
you 
would think that we were organizing to 
defeat women’s rights. I think some of 
these speeches were written by Lewis 
Carroll. 
After Virginia passed and became the 
38th State, the House passed a resolu-
tion to affirm that, with Virginia’s ac-
tion, the equal rights amendment had 
been duly added to our Constitution as 
the 28th Amendment. However, the Re-
publican-led Senate refused to do the 
same. 
Now, with the Democratic-led Sen-
ate, I am hopeful that Congress can af-
firm the adoption of that amendment 
and provide strong, legal backing to 
those seeking to have it recognized by 
our courts as a full part of our Con-
stitution. 
What little faith we demonstrate in 
the courts of the United States of 
America when it is going to be inter-
preted, according to some, as not af-
firming equal rights for women, but 
somehow undermining equal rights. 
That is why I say that I think these 
speeches were written by Lewis Car-
roll. 
The amendment simply states, as I 
am sure has been said: ‘‘Equality of 
rights under the law shall not be de-
nied or abridged by the United States 
or by any State on account of sex.’’ 
How can that be misinterpreted to 
say somehow we are enunciating a 
proposition 
that 
would 
undermine 
rather than protect and lift up the 
rights of women? 
It is long overdue that we, as a Na-
tion, affirm this truth: that all men 
and women are created equal. Not the 
same, quite obviously, but equal, en-
dowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights; that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness. 
Madam Speaker, I have two grand-
daughters and I have three great- 
granddaughters. The late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg—the famous or, as she 
would say from time to time, the infa-
mous RGB—said this: ‘‘I would like to 
see my granddaughters, when they pick 
up the Constitution, to see that no-
tion—that women and men are persons 
of equal stature—I’d like them to see 
that it is a basic principle of our soci-
ety.’’ 
Madam Speaker, that is what this 
amendment is about. It should have 
been passed two centuries ago, but it is 
never too late to do the right thing. 
And we can take a major step forward 
this week to make that happen by 
passing the bipartisan resolution of-
fered by Representatives JACKIE SPEIER 
and TOM REED. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
supporting both H.J. Res. 17 and the re-
authorization of the Violence Against 
Women Act. Both will articulate our 
concern for women, for mothers, for 
daughters, for sisters, for neighbors, 
for friends. 
We have a chance this week to send a 
message that Congress will not tol-
erate 
violence 
or 
discrimination 
against women, and we have an oppor-
tunity to mark this Women’s History 
Month, not just with words, but with 
actions that mean something by mak-
ing history in a very positive way, ben-
efiting not only women, but our Nation 
as a whole. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support these two very im-
portant pieces of legislation. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. NADLER) to control the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York will control the 
time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
every person, regardless of sex, must be 
treated equally under the law. H.J. 
Res. 17 reaffirms this core American 
value. It makes clear that the arbi-
trary deadline in the equal rights 
amendment may not stand in the way 
of achieving full equality for women. 
With women losing their jobs at dis-
proportionately high rates, the COVID– 
19 pandemic has only further revealed 
the need for this amendment. 
In 2020, American women lost more 
than 5 million jobs. A vote for this res-
olution is a vote for equal access to 
healthcare. It is a vote for equal pay 
for the same work. It is a vote for 
equal opportunity and basic human 
rights in all other aspects of life for 
women in this country. 
Congress must act now to remove 
this arbitrary deadline. There must be 
no time limit on guaranteeing equal 
rights under the law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.J. Res. 17. 
b 1115 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
nearly a half century ago, Congress 
passed the equal rights amendment and 
sent it to the States with a 7-year 
deadline for ratification. When that 
deadline expired in 1979, it was three 
States short of passage. 
Many States rejected it because it 
was duplicative of the Fifth and 14th 
Amendments to the Constitution. Our 
Constitution already guarantees that 
all Americans receive equal protection 
under the law, and indeed these provi-
sions have driven our progress as a so-
ciety. 
More importantly, many felt that the 
ERA would unleash a crippling ava-
lanche of activist litigation that could 
have unforeseen and unintended impli-
cations to issues ranging from abortion 
to freedom of conscience and freedom 
of speech. 
Today, 50 years after its adoption, 
the Democrats propose to retroactively 
amend the ERA to remove its deadline. 
They argue that Congress can alter 
amendments it has sent to the States, 
even a half century later, and yet still 
count their ratification votes from a 
half century ago. 
This would allow them to add three 
States that voted to ratify long after 
the deadline was passed for the very 
amendment that established that dead-
line. 
Of course, they don’t explain how to 
deal with the five States that have 
since rescinded their ratification votes. 
The 
courts 
have 
already 
ruled 
against this approach as brazenly un-
constitutional. 
As Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ardent 
supporter of the ERA, pointed out a 
few years ago: ‘‘So, if you count a late-
comer on the plus side, how can you 
disregard States that said, ‘We’ve 
changed our minds?’’’ 
If the majority were serious, it would 
reintroduce the ERA and debate it 
openly and constitutionally, as Justice 
Ginsburg suggested. They won’t, be-
cause they know that in the nearly 
half century that has passed since the 
ERA was proposed, the world itself has 
passed them by. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, as a young woman in Texas, I 
marched with hundreds of other women 
in support of the equal rights amend-
ment. Today, I stand with all my col-
leagues here to affirm our support for 
women’s equality. 
Women are behind some of the Na-
tion’s greatest achievements. We flew 
across the Atlantic, fought for civil 
rights, set athletic records, sent men 
to space, and then went there our-
selves. We have forged our own paths 
and put many cracks in the glass ceil-
ing, but there is still much more to do. 
‘‘Women 
deserve 
equality.’’ 
‘‘Las 
mujeres merecemos igualdad.’’ 
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.J. Res. 17. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in full support of the equal rights 
amendment and to debunk some of the 
nonsense being spouted by my col-
leagues across the aisle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1425 
March 17, 2021 
This legislation is not about special 
rights, it is not about preferential 
treatment, and it is not about erasing 
sex differences. It is about finally guar-
anteeing equal rights, plain and simple. 
Critics of the ERA know that, or at 
least they would if they actually read 
the legislation. It is right there for all 
of us to see. ‘‘Equality of rights under 
the law shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State 
on account of sex,’’ period. 
Everyone in this Capitol has a moth-
er, and some of us are blessed to have 
daughters. This amendment is about 
them. It is about completing the work 
of generations of women before us who 
marched for full equality, and it is 
about finishing that journey so that 
the next generation will experience 
nothing other than full and fair rights 
under the law. 
I urge my colleagues to give our 
daughters that chance. Join us and 
pass this resolution. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of remov-
ing this arbitrary time limit for ratify-
ing the equal rights amendment. 
I ask all my colleagues: Are we going 
to tell our mothers, our sisters, daugh-
ters, nieces, and granddaughters that 
there is an expiration date on equality? 
I hope that answer is no. 
This pandemic has only worsened the 
inequality that women are facing, espe-
cially women of color. Making the 
equal rights amendment a part of our 
Constitution guarantees that men and 
women are truly treated equal under 
the law. 
Today, the House can send a clear 
message that we will not tolerate sex-
ual discrimination, that gender equal-
ity should be the law of the land. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, today, we confront 
one of America’s lingering legacies of 
discrimination. 
At America’s founding, women were 
intentionally left out of the Constitu-
tion and, as second-class citizens, we 
did not have the right to vote or own 
property. 
Today, we still receive less pay for 
the same work, and we face actual or 
imminent threats of violence and har-
assment daily. 
But the equal rights amendment re-
jects that. 
After over a century, the ERA is on 
the cusp of ratification, and we finally 
have a President who will make this 
long overdue provision of our Constitu-
tion a reality. 
Women’s rights should not depend on 
which party is in power. These basic 
fundamental rights must be guaran-
teed. We must secure equality for 
women under the law, in the Constitu-
tion, and in our daily lives. 
If we want to hand a more perfect 
union over to our daughters—and I 
have 
two—this 
Women’s 
History 
Month, let’s seize the moment and end 
sex discrimination once and for all. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this resolution 
to remove the arbitrary and outdated 
deadline for ratifying the ERA. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, for 
nearly 50 years, our country has strived 
to make equal rights for women a 
foundational 
value 
in 
the 
United 
States Constitution through the equal 
rights 
amendment. 
Women 
deserve 
nothing less than equal treatment, 
whether it be equal pay for equal work, 
freedom from discrimination, freedom 
from sexual assault, or freedom from 
domestic violence. The equal rights 
amendment will help to fill those gaps. 
We now have enough States for that 
to become the law of the land. This res-
olution will help clear the path for this 
much-needed change, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this important 
resolution so that every woman and 
every girl can have equal justice under 
the law. 
I ask my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle: What are you afraid of? 
Why? Why can you not affirm equal 
rights for women in the United States 
of America? It is not a hard mountain 
to climb. But it says every woman and 
every girl can have equal justice under 
the law. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, we 
are prepared to close. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose H.J. Res. 
17. I believe that the speakers we have 
had here today on our side have agreed 
with that and made very, very effective 
points on why to oppose this resolu-
tion. 
Men and women are already equal 
under the Constitution. This legisla-
tion would make us no more equal. It 
is merely a vehicle for the far-left’s 
special interest groups to use to enact 
their pro-abortion agenda. It is uncon-
stitutional. It is unnecessary. And it 
should not become law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this resolution, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, Alice Paul’s equal 
rights amendment was introduced in 
both Houses of Congress way back in 
1923. But 96 years later, the United 
States Constitution still does not ex-
plicitly declare that women have equal 
rights under the law. 
We are the only western democracy 
without such a clause in its Constitu-
tion. Today, we have an opportunity to 
rectify that glaring omission. 
The arbitrary deadline for ratifica-
tion that Congress imposed, and later 
extended, can be just as easily re-
moved, and that is all this legislation 
does. It can be just as easily removed, 
because it is not part of the amend-
ment, as some of our Republican 
friends said. 
Every amendment since the 22nd 
Amendment, except for the 27th, has 
had such a clause. And if you look at 
the text of the Constitution, it is not 
there. That is because the deadline is 
part of the resolution proposing the 
constitutional amendment, not part of 
the constitutional amendment. If Con-
gress can establish a deadline by reso-
lution, it can certainly, by resolution, 
extend or change the deadline. That is 
all this resolution does. 
Adopting the ERA would bring our 
country closer to truly fulfilling values 
of inclusion and equal opportunity for 
all people. Adopting this legislation 
would help make this a reality. 
I urge all Members to support this 
resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
we have just been engaged in pre-
senting to the public the Violence 
Against Women Act. But all of it 
stands on the shoulders of the equal 
rights amendment, which has been long 
overdue. 
What an amazing journey that this 
legislation has taken, and how sad it is 
to acknowledge that we are one of only 
a few nations that does not have an 
equal rights amendment in its con-
stitution. 
I remember going to Afghanistan and 
working with the women of Afghani-
stan to include the rights of women in 
their Constitution. I want to say that 
again: To include the rights of women 
in their Constitution. 
So let me speak clearly to vital 
points of this resolution. This is not an 
abortion bill. However, we realize that 
the right to choose is embedded in the 
Constitution in the Ninth Amendment. 
But this is not that. 
It is a bill that says that women have 
a right, as Alice Paul said so many 
years ago, to be able to have rights of 
equality under this flag, under this 
Constitution. Are we suggesting that 
that should not be? 
In addition, let it be very clear that 
any court decision that was issued, the 
U.S. District Court for the District of 
Columbia, that is, the Commonwealth 
of Virginia v. Ferriero, we can explain 
that case, because the Court said the 
only authority to extend the deadline 
was Congress, and here we are. Con-
gress is now intending to extend that 
deadline.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1426 
March 17, 2021 
Nothing in the Constitution prohibits 
that. It is not embedded in the amend-
ment. And by Article V, we are able to 
deal with deadlines. Deadlines are a 
simple process of statutory authority, 
and that is what we are doing today. 
I don’t think my friends on the other 
side of the aisle want to leave without 
recognizing the fact that women make 
80 cents for every $1 a man earns, and 
that they are treated unfairly in the 
workplace. 
If you want equal dignity, if you 
want the rights of women to be pro-
moted, vote for the ERA. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.J. 
Res. 17. H.J. Res. 17, introduced by Rep-
resentative JACKIE SPEIER with 209 co-spon-
sors, would take a critical step towards ensur-
ing that the Equal Rights Amendment, or 
‘‘ERA’’, becomes part of the Constitution. 
The resolution provides that notwithstanding 
the ratification deadline of 1979 that Congress 
set for the ERA and later extended to 1982, 
the ERA ‘‘shall be valid to all intents and pur-
poses as part of the Constitution whenever 
ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of 
the several States.’’ 
The purpose of the ERA is simple and fun-
damental: It ensures that everyone is treated 
equally under the law, regardless of sex or 
gender. Almost one hundred years ago, Alice 
Paul, who helped lead the campaign to secure 
women’s right to vote, proposed the first 
version of the ERA. 
She and her fellow suffragists knew that if 
women were to achieve true equality, our Na-
tion’s founding document needed to be 
amended to reflect that core principle. Nearly 
a century later, it is long past time to make 
that dream a reality. 
In 1971 and 1972, the House and Senate, 
respectively, passed the ERA by well more 
than the constitutionally-mandated two-thirds 
majority in each chamber. 
It contained these simple words: ‘‘Equality of 
rights under the law shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by any State 
on account of sex.’’ In the years that quickly 
followed, dozens of States ratified the ERA 
through their legislatures. 
By the end of the 1970s, the ERA was just 
a few States short of full ratification. But then 
progress slowed, and the deadline Congress 
had set for ratification passed. A well-orga-
nized counter-movement scared the American 
people into thinking that a guarantee of equal-
ity would somehow harm women who stay at 
home to raise their children or would erode 
American families. What had started as a mat-
ter of broad consensus became another divi-
sive wedge in the culture wars. 
Today we know better. We know that in the 
year 2021, it is unacceptable that women still 
make only 80 cents for every dollar men earn. 
We know that when women are treated with 
equal dignity and respect in the workplace, in 
the home, by our institutions of government, 
and in our society at large, all of the American 
people stand to benefit. And we know that a 
simple but fundamental guarantee of equality 
should be welcomed rather than feared. 
Thankfully, the momentum for ERA ratifica-
tion has picked back up. Nevada ratified the 
ERA in 2017, and Illinois followed suit the next 
year. Then, in January 2020, Virginia made 
history and became the 38th State to pass a 
resolution ratifying the ERA. So long as these 
last three ratifications are valid, the ERA will 
become law. 
Unfortunately, a federal district court ruled 
two weeks ago that these states were too late 
because the ratification deadline that Con-
gress set had expired already in 1982. 
Importantly, that court affirmed that Con-
gress has the power to set ratifications dead-
lines, as Article V of the Constitution, which 
governs the constitutional amendment proc-
ess, does not itself provide for ratification 
deadlines of any kind. Of course, the power to 
set deadlines necessarily includes the power 
to remove those deadlines. 
By removing the ratification deadline that 
Congress set previously, H.J. Res. 17 ensures 
that the recent ratifications by Nevada, Illinois, 
and Virginia are counted and that the ERA be-
comes part of our Constitution. 
We are on the verge of a breakthrough for 
equality in this country, despite all the obsta-
cles in our current political and social climate. 
This resolution will ensure that no deadline 
stands in the way. Therefore, I strongly sup-
port H.J. Res. 17 and urge its passage by the 
House. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to offer my strong support for H.J. 
Res. 17, a resolution removing the time limit 
for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. 
Women in the United States make extraor-
dinary contributions to our workforce and com-
munities—and even more so in the face of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Yet, unfortunately, we 
remain unprotected under the law from dis-
crimination. This long-overdue legislation will 
enshrine in our Constitution the principle of 
women’s equality and explicitly prohibit dis-
crimination based on sex. 
The Equal Rights Amendment states simply: 
‘‘equality of rights under the law shall not be 
denied or abridged by the United States or by 
any State on account of sex.’’ And in this sim-
ple text is guaranteed the following: 
Avenues of legal recourse for people who 
face sex-based discrimination, 
Prompting of Supreme Court to consider 
cases of sex discrimination with rigorous 
standards, and 
The power for Congress to enact laws that 
ensure sex equality in all aspects of life. 
It is for these reasons, and many others not 
listed, that we must act to remove the arbitrary 
time limit for ratification and codify this 
Amendment. 
As a member of the Democratic Women’s 
Caucus, I am steadfast in my commitment to 
advancing women’s rights both in my district 
and across the nation. My tenure in Congress 
has been in part defined by my advocacy on 
behalf of women and their successes—but I 
stand on the shoulders of generations of hero-
ines fighting for equality. It is in their honor 
that I support this legislation today. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 
17.

DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
JACKSON
LEE, REP-
RESENTATIVE
FITZPATRICK, 
AND
CHAIRMAN 
NADLER: The National Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence, (NCADV) applauds you for 
introducing the Violence Against Women Re-
authorization Act of 2021. The Violence 
Against Women Act (VAWA) is one of the 
three pillars of the Federal response to do-
mestic violence. First passed in 1994 under 
the leadership of then-Senator Biden, VAWA 
has been reauthorized three times since 
then, most recently in 2013. VAWA’s author-
ization lapsed in 2018. 
Every reauthorization included critical up-
dates to enhance America’s response to do-
mestic violence and other forms of gender- 
based violence. These enhancements reflect 
the evolution of our understanding of the dy-
namics of violence and the needs of impacted 
communities. The Violence Against Women 
Reauthorization Act of 2021 is the successor 
bill to these previous reauthorizations and is 
a slightly updated version of the H.R. 1585/S. 
2843, the Violence Against Women Reauthor-
ization Act of 2019, which passed the House of 
Representatives with strong bipartisan sup-
port before dying in the Senate. 
Like its predecessor, the updated 2021 bill 
invests in prevention; keeps guns out of the 
hands of adjudicated dating abusers and 
stalkers; promotes survivors’ economic sta-
bility; ends impunity for non Natives who 
commit gender-based violence on Tribal 
lands by expanding special tribal criminal 
jurisdiction beyond domestic violence; and 
increases survivors’ access to safe housing. 
The Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2021 also recognizes the disparate 
impact of gender-based violence on commu-
nities of color due to systemic racism and in-
creases funding for culturally specific orga-
nizations serving these communities. The Vi-
olence Against Women Reauthorization Act 
of 2021 expands VAWA’s life-saving provi-
sions to increase access to safety and justice 
for all survivors. 
It is particularly critical to reauthorize 
and improve VAWA as we continue to battle 
the COVID–19 pandemic. In a recent survey 
of domestic violence programs, 84% reported 
that intimate partner violence has increased 
in their community during the pandemic. 
Fifty percent reported the use of firearms. 
against intimate partners has increased, and 
one-third reported intimate partner homi-
cides have increased in their communities. 
The Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2021 responds to the needs of sur-
vivors and supports the programs that serve 
them. 
We thank you, again, for your leadership, 
and we urge the House to pass the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 
as a matter of upmost urgency. 
Sincerely, 
The National Coalition Against Domestic 
Violence.

NATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER 
ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
Harrisburg, PA, March 8, 2021. 
Hon. JERRY NADLER, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
House of Representatives,

DEAR REPRESENTATIVES NADLER, JACKSON 
LEE AND FITZPATRICK: On behalf of the Na-
tional Resource Center on Domestic Vio-
lence, which has worked since 1993 to 
strengthen and transform efforts to end do-
mestic violence, I am writing to express our 
support for the Reauthorization of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2021 
and our gratitude for your leadership in en-
suring that survivors are able to access life-
saving programs and services. 
With each reauthorization of VAWA, Con-
gress has made important steps forward to 
better address the needs of survivors and 
communities. Based on extensive conversa-
tions with and feedback from local programs 
and advocates about current strengths and 
disparities in VAWA, we—along with our 
partners in the domestic and sexual violence 
movements—recommended several key en-
hancements to the current statute. We are 
very pleased that your legislation includes 
the targeted improvements that programs 
across the country need to do their jobs and 
support survivors. 
According to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol’s National Intimate Partner and Sexual 
Violence Survey (NISVS), 1 in 4 women and 
1 in 9 men are the victim of physical vio-
lence, contact sexual violence and/or stalk-
ing by an intimate partner and experience 
negative impacts such as injury, fear, con-
cern for safety, or a need for services. In just 
one day in 2019, 77,226 domestic violence vic-
tims and their children received services at a 
local program in their community, including 
emergency 
shelter, 
transitional 
housing, 
counseling, legal advocacy, and children’s 
support groups. However, on that same day, 
11,336 requests for services went unmet be-
cause programs lacked the resources to meet 
victims’ needs. Of those unmet requests for 
services, 68% were for housing. Indeed, safe 
housing is among the most pressing concerns 
for survivors who have left or are planning 
to leave an abusive relationship. Thirty- 
eight (38) percent of all domestic violence 
victims become homeless at some point in 
their lives. And among mothers with chil-
dren experiencing homelessness, more than 
80 percent had previously experienced domes-
tic violence. We are particularly grateful 
that your legislation would strengthen pro-
tections for survivors in public housing, in-
cluding by ensuring that survivors can trans-
fer units when necessary for safety reasons, 
as well as other housing protections that are 
critical for survivors seeking safety and sta-
bility. 
We are also supportive of other key pro-
posals in your legislation, including: 
Supporting Communities of Color; 
Investing in prevention; 
Ending impunity for non-Native perpetra-
tors of sexual assault, child abuse co-occur-
ring with domestic violence, stalking, sex 
trafficking, and assaults on tribal law en-
forcement officers on tribal lands; 
Improving enforcement of court orders 
that require adjudicated domestic abusers to 
relinquish their firearms; 
Improving access to housing for victims 
and survivors; 
Protecting victims of dating violence from 
firearm homicide; 
Helping survivors gain and maintain eco-
nomic independence; 
Updating the federal definition of domestic 
violence for the purposes of VAWA grants 
only to acknowledge the full range of abuse 
victims suffer (does not impact the criminal 
definition of domestic violence); 
Maintaining existing protections for all 
survivors; and 
Improving the healthcare system’s re-
sponse to domestic violence, sexual assault, 
dating violence, and stalking. 
Again, thank you for championing the 
needs of victims and survivors and for sup-
porting the work of domestic and sexual vio-
lence programs across the country. We look 
forward to continuing to work with you and 
your colleagues in Congress to ensure bipar-
tisan support for VAWA 2021 and to pass leg-
islation that will provide needed services and 
supports to survivors and their families and 
communities.

FARZANA Q. SAFIULLAH,

DEAR
REPRESENTATIVES
JACKSON
LEE, 
FITZPATRICK, AND NADLER: Ujima Inc., The 
National Center on Violence Against Women 
in the Black Community (Ujima, Inc.) is 
pleased to support H.R. 1620, the bipartisan 
Violence Against Women Reauthorization 
Act of 2021. Ujima, Inc. is a national Cul-
turally Specific Services Issue Resource Cen-
ter that mobilizes the Black community and 
allies through its education and outreach; 
training and technical assistance; resource 
development; research; and public policy ef-
forts. We work with local, state, and na-
tional partners to promote strategies to im-
prove responses to Black survivors of domes-
tic violence, sexual assault, and community 
violence. We appreciated the opportunity to 
give voice to the needs of Black survivors 
during the collaborative process of H.R. 1585 
and we are encouraged to see the enhance-
ments in H.R. 1620 as COVID–19, racial jus-
tice movements, and economic strife have 
presented complex challenges for those we 
serve since the passage of H.R. 1585 in 2019. 
Since 1994, the Violence Against Women 
Act has made significant shifts in the cul-
tural and legal landscape for prevention and 
intervention strategies to address gender- 
based violence. Specialized courts, prosecu-
tion units, law enforcement departments, 
community-based 
programs, 
coordinated 
community 
responses, 
and 
discretionary 
grant funding for innovate solutions have 
been the central tenets of ground-breaking 
legislation to save lives. However, Black 
women still experience the highest rates of 
homicide related to intimate partner vio-
lence compared to other racial and ethnic 
populations. In 2018, Black females were 
murdered by males at a rate nearlv three 
times higher than white females. Despite the 
prevalence of domestic violence, Black sur-
vivors are less likely to seek help from sys-
tems-based stakeholders because institu-
tional bias coupled with racial loyalty/col-
lectivism directly impact how she perceives, 
reacts to, and reports violence in her life. In-
stitutionalized and internalized oppression 
at the intersections of race and gender have 
created the foundation for unrecognized, 
unaddressed trauma and violence in the lives 
of Black women and they have been denied 
adequate resources and access to legal sys-
tems, funding, crisis services, and other pro-
grams. 
Thank you for not only hearing the needs 
of Black survivors, but also addressing them 
in H.R. 1620 which provides measured en-
hancements for the bipartisan support and 
passage 
of 
such 
critical 
provisions 
as 
strengthening and enforcing public housing 
protections, improving access to healthcare 
options, expanding civil legal representation, 
promoting firearm surrender protocols, re-
ducing bench warrants for victims who fear 
to appear in court, creating restorative prac-
tices that are solutions-based, expanding 
tribal sovereignty over specific crimes com-
mitted by non-Native perpetrators, and 
prioritizing sexual assault prevention to 
ameliorate intervention. 
Additionally, the following provisions will 
greatly improve services for Black survivors 
and we deeply appreciate the inclusion of: a 
$40 million authorization for the Culturally 
Specific Services Program; economic justice 
programs that include access to unemploy-
ment insurance; and protections for all sur-
vivors accessing services thereby preventing 
discrimination. 
Thank you for your unyielding and tireless 
efforts and bringing the margins to the cen-
ter to ensure that VAWA, after twenty-seven 
years, continues to prioritize the safety of 
survivors and hold perpetrators accountable 
in a way that is survivor-centered, honors 
self-determination, and reduces re-victimiza-
tion by systems. We are deeply moved by 
your commitment to social change that pro-
motes access to services and justice for all 
people, and we embrace the opportunity to 
stand with you. 
We are available to assist you at any time 
to facilitate the passage of this landmark bi-
partisan bill that is the hallmark of our 
work. 
Respectfully, 
KARMA COTTMAN, 
Executive Director. 
YWCA, 
Washington, DC, March 12, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: On behalf of 
YWCA USA, a network of over 200 local asso-
ciations in 45 states and the District of Co-
lumbia, I write today to urge you to pass the 
Violence Against Women Reauthorization 
Act (VAWA) of 2021 (H.R. 1620). As identified 
in YWCA’s Legislative Priorities for the 
117th Congress, YWCA is committed to the 
swift passage of VAWA in the first 100 days 
of the new legislative session. We urge you 
to vote yes and support strengthening serv-
ices for survivors and their children. 
For over 160 years, YWCA has been on a 
mission 
to 
eliminate 
racism, 
empower 
women, and promote peace, justice, freedom, 
and dignity for all. Today, we serve over 2 
million women, girls and family members of 
all ages and backgrounds in more than 1,200 
communities. As the largest network of do-
mestic and sexual violence service providers, 
over 150 YWCAs across 44 states remain on 
the front lines providing gender-based vio-
lence services. We are proud of our staff and 
volunteers in providing these life-saving 
services. YWCAs get up and do the work of 
providing safe and secure housing, crisis hot-
lines, counseling, court assistance, and other 
community and safety programs to more 
than 535,000 women, children, and families 
each year. 
Informed by our extensive history, the ex-
pertise of our nationwide network, and our 
collective commitment to meeting the needs 
of survivors and their families, we have seen 
first-hand the importance of maintaining 
protections for all survivors in the Violence 
Against Women Act (VAWA). This bill works

to maintain the safety, resources, and pro-
tections critical to all survivors, particu-
larly women of color and other marginalized 
communities. 
Of 
particular 
importance, 
VAWA includes the following YWCA sup-
ported provisions critical to survlvors: 
Improves 
services 
for 
victims 
by 
re-
authoring programs administered by the 
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. 
Health and Human Services to prevent and 
address domestic violence, sexual violence, 
dating violence, and stalking while pre-
serving and expanding housing protections 
for survivors; 
Increases authorization levels for response 
and wrap-around services especially impor-
tant following a year of increased strain on 
existing providers due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Invests in prevention through increased 
funding for programs such as the Consoli-
dated Youth grants which support engaging 
men and boys as allies and addressing chil-
dren exposed to violence and trauma with 
specialized services. This bill also provides 
support to State-level health programs to 
partner with domestic and sexual violence 
organizations to improve healthcare pro-
viders’ ability to work with advocates, help 
victims, and strengthen prevention pro-
grams; 
Closes loopholes by improving enforcement 
of current federal domestic violence-related 
firearms laws and close loopholes to reduce 
firearm-involved abuse and intimate partner 
homicide, which has received bipartisan sup-
port; 
Increases funding for culturally-specific 
service providers and increases authorization 
levels to hold current providers harmless; 
Improves the economic security of sur-
vivors by expanding eligibility for unemploy-
ment insurance, strengthening protections 
against discrimination in employment based 
on survivor status, and increasing education 
on economic abuse and economic security re-
lated to survivors. 
Immediate action by Congress is needed as 
the COVID–19 pandemic continues to put a 
strain on resources and the demand for as-
sistance continues to rise with this silent 
epidemic. Survivors cannot wait another day 
for the critical protections identified in the 
Violence Against Women Reauthorization 
Act (VAWA) of 2021. We urge you to vote yes 
on this critical bill. 
Thank you for your time and consider-
ation. Please contact Pam Yuen, YWCA USA 
Director of Government Relations if you 
have any questions. 
Sincerely, 
CATHERINE V. BEANE, 
Vice President of Public Policy & Advocacy. 
NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO 
END SEXUAL VIOLENCE, 
March 4, 2021. 
Hon SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES JACKSON LEE AND 
FITZPATRICK: On behalf of the National Alli-
ance to End Sexual Violence (NAESV) rep-
resenting 56 state and territorial sexual as-
sault coalitions and more than 1500 local 
rape crisis centers, I am writing to convey 
our wholehearted support for the Violence 
Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 
2021 reauthorizing and improving the Vio-
lence Against Women Act (VAWA) and our 
gratitude for your willingness to move for-
ward to ensure we renew VAWA as swiftly as 
possible. 
With each iteration of VAWA, Congress 
goes the next step to address the needs of 
survivors and communities. Based on exten-
sive conversations with local programs and 
advocates, we brought forward several key 
enhancements, and we are very pleased that 
your legislation includes many of these. 
From an increased investment in sexual vio-
lence services and prevention programs and 
culturally specific organizations that serve 
communities of color to provisions to hold 
offenders accountable on tribal lands to ef-
forts to make our criminal justice system 
more responsive to the needs of victims, this 
legislation includes the realistic policies our 
programs need to do their jobs. 
According to the National Intimate Part-
ner and Sexual Violence Survey, one in five 
women has been the victim of rape or at-
tempted rape. Nearly one in two women has 
experienced some form of sexual violence 
and one in five men has experienced a form 
of sexual violence other than rape in their 
lifetime. The study confirmed that the im-
pacts on society are enormous. Over 80% of 
women who were victimized experienced sig-
nificant short and long-term impacts related 
to the violence such as Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder (PTSD), injury (42%) and 
missed time at work or school (28%). The 
CDC report shows that most rape and part-
ner violence is experienced before the age of 
24, highlighting the importance of pre-
venting this violence before it occurs. 
High profile cases of sexual assault on 
campuses, our military bases, military acad-
emies, and professional sports have resulted 
in unprecedented media attention. This has 
also resulted in a tremendous increase in 
sexual assault survivors seeking assistance 
from local rape crisis centers and educators 
as well as community organizations request-
ing prevention and training services. The 
media attention also points to the need for 
comprehensive community responses to sex-
ual violence. According to data from a 2020 
survey conducted by NAESV, 62% of local 
sexual assault programs have a waiting list, 
sometimes months long, for counseling serv-
ices and 35% lack a full time sexual assault 
therapist on staff. 
For these reasons, we are incredibly grate-
ful that your legislation increases the au-
thorizations for the Sexual Assault Services 
Program and the Rape Prevention and Edu-
cation Program. The local programs in our 
network see every day the widespread and 
devastating consequences of sexual violence, 
and this additional funding will help them 
respond to community requests for services 
and prevention education. 
Of deep concern to NAESV, tribal govern-
ments are currently unable to prosecute 
crimes of sexual assault, trafficking, child 
abuse, and stalking by non-native offenders 
on their lands. A 2016 study from the Na-
tional Institute for Justice (NIJ), found that 
approximately 56% of Native women experi-
ence sexual violence within their lifetime, 
with 1 in 7 experiencing it in the past year. 
Nearly 1 in 2 report being stalked. Contrary 
to the general population where rape, sexual 
assault, and intimate partner violence are 
usually intra-racial, Native women are more 
likely to be raped or assaulted by someone of 
a different race. 96% of Native women and 
89% of male victims in the NIJ study re-
ported being victimized by a non-Indian. Na-
tive victims of sexual violence are three 
times as likely to have experienced sexual 
violence by an interracial perpetrator as 
non-Hispanic White victims. Similarly, Na-
tive stalking victims are nearly 4 times as. 
likely to be stalked by someone of a dif-
ferent race, with 89% of female stalking vic-
tims and 90% of male stalking victims re-
porting inter-racial victimization. The high-
er rate of inter-racial violence would not 
necessarily be significant if It were not for 
the jurisdictional complexities unique to In-
dian Country and the limitations imposed by 
federal law on tribal authority to hold non- 
Indians accountable for crimes they commit 
on tribal lands. 
We stand with you in affirming tribes’ sov-
ereignty to prosecute non-native offenders of 
sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking and 
stalking. VAWA 2013 restored the authority 
of Tribes to arrest and prosecute offenders, 
regardless of their race, for acts of domestic 
violence committed within the boundaries of 
their jurisdiction. Since enactment, at least 
16 Tribes have undertaken the steps to exer-
cise the special domestic violence criminal 
jurisdiction {SDVCJ) restored by VAWA 
2013—leading to over 120 arrests. Tribal vic-
tims deserve justice, and we fully support 
these provisions. 
Many survivors of sexual assault, abuse, 
and harassment have housing needs. For 
some survivors, home may not be a safe 
place and they may need to leave due to sex-
ual violence they are experiencing in their 
home that is perpetrated by a household 
member, landlord, or neighbor. Other sur-
vivors may need to find safe housing to heal 
and lessen the effects of sexual violence they 
have experienced either in their home or 
they may need to find new housing if the 
perpetrator knows where they live to stay 
safe. VAWA includes important protections 
for survivors of sexual assault in public 
housing, and these provisions are a critical 
part of the safety net for survivors. 
We are very pleased to support your vital 
legislation that moves us forward in our 
work to end sexual violence. Please contact 
our Policy Director, Terri Poore, with any 
questions.

MONIKA JOHNSON HOSTLER

The Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-

impact of gender-based violence on commu-

that intimate partner violence has increased 
in their community during the pandemic. 
Fifty percent reported the use of firearms 
against intimate partners has increased, and 
one-third reported intimate partner homi-

The Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-

Re: Support for Passage of HR 1620, the Vio-

Act of 2021. 
Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE JACKSON LEE
AND 
REPRESENTATIVE FITZPATRICK: I am writing 
on behalf of the National Congress of Amer-
ican Indians (NCAI), the nation’s oldest and 
largest organization of American Indian and 
Alaska Native tribal governments, to thank 
you for your leadership in introducing HR 
1620, the Violence Against Women Reauthor-
ization Act (VAWA) of 2021, and to convey 
our support for your efforts. NCAI has been 
actively involved in the development of the 
tribal provisions of VAWA in each of the 
past reauthorizations of the bill. Each time 
VAWA has been reauthorized, it has included 
important provisions aimed at improving 
safety and justice for Native women. 
In 2019, NCAI adopted resolution ECWS–19– 
005 (attached), which sets forth five prior-
ities for reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act: 
(1) include provisions, like those included 
in the bipartisan Native Youth and Tribal 
Officer Protection Act and Justice for Native 
Survivors of Sexual Violence Act, that 
amend 25 U.S.C. 1304 to address jurisdictional 
gaps 
including: 
child 
abuse 
and 
endangerment; assaults against law enforce-
ment officers; sexual violence; stalking; traf-
ficking; and the exclusion of certain tribes 
from the law; 
(2) create a permanent authorization for 
DOJ’s Tribal Access to National Crime Infor-
mation Program and ensure that TAP is 
available to all tribes; 
(3) improve the response to cases of miss-
ing and murdered women in tribal commu-
nities; 
(4) identify and address the unique barriers 
to safety for Alaska Native women and pro-
vide access to all programs; and 
(5) reauthorize VAWA’s tribal grant pro-
grams and ensure that funding is available 
to cover costs incurred by tribes who are ex-
ercising jurisdiction pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 
1304. 
We are pleased to see that your legislation 
continues to build on VAWA’s promise and 
includes the key priorities that have been 
identified by tribal governments and advo-
cates to further enhance safety for victims 
in tribal communities. 
As you know, tribal communities continue 
to be plagued by the highest crime victim-
ization rates in the country. A recent study 
by the National Institute of Justice found 
that over 80% of Native Americans will be a 
victim of intimate partner violence, sexual 
violence, or stalking in their lifetime. The 
study also found that 90% of these victims 
were victimized by a non-Indian perpetrator. 
Sadly, Native children are particularly af-
fected by this violence. Native children are 
50% more likely to experience child abuse 
and sexual abuse than white children. The 
complicated 
jurisdictional 
framework 
at 
play in Indian Country continues to under-
mine safety for victims of violence in tribal 
communities. 
Eight years ago, when Congress passed 
VAWA 2013, it included a provision, known 
as Special Domestic Violence Criminal Ju-
risdiction (SDVCJ), that reaffirmed the in-
herent sovereign authority of Indian tribal 
governments to exercise criminal jurisdic-
tion over certain non-Indians who violate 
qualifying protection orders or commit do-
mestic or dating violence against Indian vic-
tims on tribal lands. Since passage of VAWA 
2013, we have witnessed the ways in which 
tribal jurisdiction has transformed access to 
justice for some domestic violence victims, 
and also the ways in which it falls short for 
victims of sexual violence, stalking, traf-
ficking, and child abuse. We welcome intro-
duction of your bill, which would address 
many of the gaps in the existing law and 
make important strides toward restoring 
public safety and justice on tribal lands. 
We are particularly grateful that your leg-
islation recognizes that Native children are 
equally in need of the protections that were 
extended to adult domestic violence victims 
in VAWA 2013. The Tribal Nations imple-
menting SDVCJ report that children have 
been involved as victims or witnesses in 
SDVCJ cases nearly 60% of the time. These 
children have been assaulted or have faced 
physical intimidation and threats, are living 
in fear, and are at risk for developing school- 
related problems, medical illnesses, post- 
traumatic stress disorder, and other impair-
ments. However, federal law currently limits 
SDVCJ to crimes committed only against in-
timate partners or persons covered by a 
qualifying protection order. The common 
scenario reported by Tribal Nations is that 
they are only able to charge a non-Indian 
batterer for violence against the mother, and 
can do nothing about violence against the 
children. Your bill would change that. 
Your bill will also make strides in improv-
ing the coordination and collaboration be-
tween tribal, local, and federal jurisdictions, 
particularly with regard to criminal justice 
information sharing. These reforms are des-
perately needed and will make a real dif-
ference for victims of crime in Indian Coun-
try. We look forward to continuing this im-
portant work with your offices and thank 
you for your commitment to tribal commu-
nities. 
Thank you, 
FAWN SHARP, 
President. 
THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF AMERICAN 
INDIANS RESOLUTION #ECWS–19–005 
Urging Congress to Pass a Long-term Reau-
thorization 
of 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act that Includes Key Protec-
tions for Native Women 
Whereas, we, the members of the National 
Congress of American Indians of the United 
States, invoking the divine blessing of the 
Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in 
order to preserve for ourselves and our de-
scendants the inherent sovereign rights of 
our Indian nations, rights secured under In-
dian treaties and agreements with the 
United States, and all other rights and bene-
fits to which we are entitled under the laws 
and Constitution of the United States and 
the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten 
the public toward a better understanding of 
the Indian people, to preserve Indian cul-
tural values, and otherwise promote the 
health, safety and welfare of the Indian peo-
ple, do hereby establish and submit the fol-
lowing resolution; and 
Whereas, the National Congress of Amer-
ican Indians (NCAI) was established in 1944 
and is the oldest and largest national organi-
zation of American Indian and Alaska Native 
tribal governments; and 
Whereas, NCAI resolution STP–00–081 es-
tablished the NCAI Task Force on Violence 
Against Native Women, which has worked 
since that time to identify needed policy re-
forms at the tribal and federal levels, includ-
ing in the Violence Against Women Act 
(VAWA); 
Whereas, VAWA was first passed in 1994, 
reauthorized in 2000, again in 2005, and 2013 
and each of these bills included important 
provisions aimed at improving safety and 
justice for Native women; 
Whereas, the last long-term reauthoriza-
tion of VAWA expired on September 30, 2018 
and Congress has passed a series of short- 
term extensions that leave VAWA currently 
scheduled to expire on February 15, 2019; 
Whereas, Native communities continue to 
experience high levels of domestic violence, 
sexual violence, child abuse, stalking, mur-
der, and trafficking, many of these crimes 
are committed by non-Indians, and there is a 
need to amend federal law to improve access 
to justice and safety for victims in tribal 
communities; 
Whereas, VAWA 2013 included a provision 
that reaffirmed the inherent sovereign au-
thority of Indian tribal governments to exer-
cise criminal jurisdiction over certain non- 
Indians who violate qualifying protection or-
ders or commit domestic or dating violence 
against Indian victims on tribal lands; 
Whereas, by exercising jurisdiction over 
non-Indian domestic violence offenders many 
tribal communities have increased safety 
and justice for victims who had previously 
seen little of either; 
Whereas, the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
testified before the Senate Committee on In-
dian Affairs in 2016 that VAWA 2013 has al-
lowed tribes to ‘‘respond to long-time abus-
ers who previously had evaded justice,’’ but 
that there are significant additional gaps 
that need to be addressed; 
Whereas, the tribes implementing VAWA 
2013 report that children have been involved 
as victims or witnesses in their cases nearly 
60% of the time and federal law prevents 
tnbal courts from holding non-Indian offend-
ers accountable for these crimes; 
Whereas, according to DOJ, American In-
dian and Alaska Native children suffer expo-
sure to violencci at rates higher than any 
other race in the United States, and this vio-
lence has immediate and long term effects,

including: increased rates of altered neuro-
logical development; poor physical and men-
tal health; poor school performance; sub-
stance abuse; and overrepresentation in the 
juvenile justice system; 
Whereas, a 2016 report from the National 
Institute for Justice (NIJ) confirmed that 
56% of Native omen experience sexual vio-
lence within their lifetime and nearly 1 in 2 
report being stalked; 
Whereas, according to NIJ Native victims 
of sexual violence are three times as likely 
to have experienced sexual violence by an 
interracial 
perpetrator 
as 
non-Hispanic 
White victims and Native stalking victims 
are nearly 4 times as likely to be stalked by 
someone of a different race, but federal law 
prevents tribal courts from holding non-In-
dian offenders accountable for these crimes; 
Whereas, VAWA 2005 included. a provision 
directing the Attorney General to permit In-
dian tribes to enter information into and ob-
tain information from federal criminal infor-
mation databases; 
Whereas, in 2015 DOJ announced the Tribal 
Access Program for National Crime Informa-
tion (TAP), which provides eligible tribes 
with access to the Criminal Justice Informa-
tion Services systems; 
Whereas, there has never been funding au-
thorized for the TAP program and some 
tribes report that they are unable to access 
the program; 
Whereas, on some reservations, American 
Indian and Alaska Native women are mur-
dered at more than 10 times the national av-
erage; 
Whereas, in many cases, law enforcement 
has failed to adequately respond to cases of 
missing arid murdered American Indian and 
Alaska Native women, leaving family mem-
bers to organize their own searches and com-
munity marches for justice and without ac-
cess to support or services; and 
Whereas, Alaska Native women experience 
some of the highest rates of violence in the 
country and geographical remoteness, ex-
treme weather, the lack of transportation in-
frastructure, and unique jurisdictional com-
plexities present unique challenges to Native 
women’s safety; 
Whereas, certain tribes subject to restric-
tive settlement acts have not been able to 
implement the tribal jurisdiction provision 
of VAWA 2013. 
Now therefore be it resolved, that NCAI 
calls on Congress to move swiftly to pass a 
long-term reauthorization of VAWA that 
will: 
Include provisions like those included in 
the Native Youth and Tribal Officer Protec-
tion Act and Justice. for Native Survivors of 
Sexual Violence Act that amend 25 USC 1304 
to address jurisdictional gaps including: 
child abuse and endangerment; assaults 
against law enforcement officers; sexual vio-
lence; stalking; trafficking; and the exclu-
sion of certain tribes from the law; 
Create a perment authorization for DOJ’s 
Tribal Access to National Crime Information 
Program and ensure that TAP is available to 
all tribes; 
Improve the response to and classification 
of incidents of missing and murdered Indian 
women consistent with NCAI Resolution 
PHX–16–077; 
Identify and address the unique barriers to 
safety for Alaska Native women, based upon 
meaningful findings, and provide access to 
all programs; and 
Reauthorize VAWA’s tribal grant programs 
and ensure that funding is available to cover 
costs incurred by tribes who are exercising 
jurisdiction pursuant to VAWA; 
Be it further resolved, that NCAI will op-
pose any VAWA reauthorization bill that un-
dermines tribal sovereignty, unfairly penal-
izes tribes in accessing federal funds, or that 
diminishes tribal inherent authority to de-
fine and address crimes of domestic or dating 
violence, sexual violence, stalking, or traf-
ficking; and 
Be it finally resolved, resolution shall be 
the policy of NCAI until it is withdrawn or 
modified by subsequent resolution.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE JACKSON LEE
AND 
REPRESENTATIVE FITZPATRICK: Legal Momen-
tum, the Women’s Legal Defense and Edu-
cation Fund commends you for introducing 
the Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2021. Legal Momentum is the na-
tion’s first and longest-serving advocacy or-
ganization dedicated to advancing gender 
equality. We make these advancements 
through targeted litigation, innovative pub-
lic policy, and education. Preventing and re-
sponding to gender-based violence is a core 
pillar of Legal Momentum’s work, in rec-
ognition of the fact that freedom from vio-
lence is central to achieving true equality. 
Legal Momentum is proud to have been 
closely involved in developing the landmark 
bipartisan legislation that became the Vio-
lence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994. 
Our organization played a critical role in 
drafting and advocating for VAWA’s passage, 
beginning this effort with then-Senator Joe 
Biden in 1990. We have since worked in coali-
tion with the National Task Force to End 
Sexual and Domestic Violence to see en-
hanced services and protections included in 
each.reauthorization 
of 
VAWA, 
each 
of 
which had bipartisan support. Legal Momen-
tum is grateful to you for your dedication to 
reauthorizing VAWA-in a way that responds 
to the needs of all those affected by gender- 
based violence. 
The updates to the existing Violence 
Against Women Act that are included in 
your bill reflect the real needs of victims and 
survivors of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, sexual assault, and stalking. In par-
ticular, we are pleased that this reauthoriza-
tion of VAWA meets the needs of commu-
nities of color. We applaud your commit-
ment to pass a bipartisan reauthorization of 
this critical legislation. We support intro-
ducing the Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act of 2021 and hope that your 
colleagues across the political spectrum will 
recognize the importance of these enhance-
ments and join in supporting it. 
Thank you for your leadership and dedica-
tion to protecting victims and survivors. 
Sincerely, 
LYNN HECHT SCHAFRAN, Esq., 
Senior Vice President.

DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
JACKSON
LEE, REP-
RESENTATIVE
FITZPATRICK, 
AND
CHAIRMAN 
NADLER: Jewish Women International (JWI), 
the leading Jewish organization working to 
end gender-based violence, applauds your 
steadfast dedication and leadership in intro-
ducing 
the 
bipartisan 
Violence 
Against 
Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 (H.R. 
1620). 
As a Steering Committee member of the 
National Task Force to End Sexual and Do-
mestic Violence, convener of the Interfaith 
Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Vio-
lence and Clergy Task Force to End Domes-
tic Abuse in the Jewish Community, and co- 
chair of Faiths United to Prevent Gun Vio-
lence, JWI supports this bill that builds on 
VAWA’s previous successes and adds key en-
hancements to ensure the safety of victims 
of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault, and stalking. 
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) 
is our nation’s single most effective tool in 
responding to the devastating crimes of do-
mestic violence, dating violence, sexual as-
sault, and stalking—providing lifesaving pro-
grams and services. Since its initial passage, 
VAWA has dramatically enhanced and im-
proved our nation’s response to violence 
against women. VAWA is essential in the 
funding of programs and services that sur-
vivors rely on every day. This commonsense 
legislation protects victims and survivors, 
helps save lives, and makes our communities 
safer places to worship, heal, and thrive. 
Even with all of the advancements in the 
last twenty-seven years, there is still a tre-
mendous amount of work that remains. One 
third of all women (nearly 52 million women) 
in the United States have been victims of 
physical violence by an intimate partner. In 
2016 alone, there were 1.1 million domestic 
violence victimizations, 54% of which in-
volved domestic partners. The Department of 
Justice’s Criminal Victimization 2016 Bul-
letin found that more than 10% of all violent 
crime is due to intimate partner violence. 
The Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2021 responds to the urgent issues 
survivors face every day by supporting pro-
gramming to prevent gender-based violence, 
closing Tribal and firearms loopholes to pro-
tect all survivors, strengthening public hous-
ing protections for survivors, expanding the 
ability of providers to respond to sexual har-
assment, and prioritizing support for Com-
munities of Color. 
JWI and our 75,000 members and supporters 
greatly appreciate your dedication and lead-
ership in advancing the critical mission of 
passing a targeted bill that will have a broad 
impact on all survivors. Congress now has an 
opportunity to come together and pass 
meaningful legislation to help save the lives 
of victims of gender-based violence—we are 
grateful that you are spearheading this ef-
fort. 
Thank you again for being tireless cham-
pions of survivors. 
Sincerely, 
MEREDITH JACOBS, 
JWI CEO.

CASA DE ESPERANZA, 
March 8, 2021. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
Hon. BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES NADLER, JACKSON 
LEE AND FITZPATRICK: I am writing on behalf 
of Casa de Esperanza: National Latin@ Net-
work for Healthy Families and Communities 
to convey our support of the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 
(VAWA Reauthorization, H.R. 1620). We 
greatly appreciate your leadership and effort 
to fulfil the promise of the landmark Vio-
lence Against Women Act of 1994. 
Casa de Esperanza was founded in 1982 in 
Minnesota to provide emergency shelter and 
support services for women and children ex-
periencing domestic violence. In 2009, Casa 
de Esperanza launched the National Latin@ 
Network for Healthy Families and Commu-
nities, which is a national resource center 
that provides training & technical assist-
ance, research, and policy advocacy on ad-
dressing and preventing gender-based vio-
lence in Latin@ communities. Through offer-
ing direct services in Minnesota and nation-
wide advocacy, we are very aware of the crit-
ical role that VAWA has played in enhancing 
access to services, safety, and justice for all 
survivors. 
VAWA Reauthorization is a necessary part 
of our nation’s commitment to ending gen-
der-based violence. It includes narrowly fo-
cused, yet critical, enhancements to address 
gaps identified by survivors and direct serv-
ice providers. Among many provisions, the 
measure maintains vital protections for all 
survivors, invests in prevention, improves 
access to safe housing and economic inde-
pendence, and includes long overdue funding 
for culturally specific communities. 
Since the enactment of VAWA in 1994 and 
during each subsequent reauthorization of 
VAWA in 2000, 2005, and 2013, Congress has 
continued to support and improve protec-
tions for survivors in a bipartisan manner. 
During this time in which we are experi-
encing the dual crises of the Coronavirus and 
gender-based violence, we are reminded of 
the fragility of life. It is not now or ever ac-
ceptable to merely maintain the status quo, 
let alone undermine current protections and 
reduce access to safety and justice for vic-
tims and survivors, particularly those from 
vulnerable communities which also have 
been more deeply impacted by the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
In addition to ensuring important path-
ways to safety, justice, and well-being for all 
survivors, H.R. 1620 includes important en-
hancements that improve access to interven-
tion and prevention services. We are enthusi-
astic about the funding for legal and housing 
services that are life-saving resources for 
survivors of domestic and sexual violence. 
We are also very encouraged by the funds 
provided for culturally specific programs in 
H.R. 1620. 
We appreciate your commitment to mov-
ing this bill forward with bipartisan support 
and continue the longstanding commitment 
of Congress to support enhanced services and 
protections 
in 
each 
reauthorization 
of 
VAWA. Thank you for being a champion on 
behalf of all victims and survivors and for 
your commitment to improving the well- 
being of individuals, families, and commu-
nities. 
Sincerely, 
PATRICIA J. TOTOTZINTLE, 
CEO. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 1620, the ‘‘Violence Against 
Women Act of 2021,’’ that will reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994. 
The Violence Against Women Act is land-
mark legislation first enacted in 1994 and 
signed into law by President Bill Clinton which 
has—through policy reforms, interstate co-
operation and grant allocation—been pivotal in 
providing a national response to protecting 
half of the population. 
Equally important, it has ushered in a seis-
mic transformation on how society perceives 
violence against women. 
VAWA was enacted in response to the prev-
alence of domestic and sexual violence, and 
the significant impact of such violence on the 
lives of women. 
I remember those days well because I was 
serving on the board of the Houston Area 
Women’s Center (HAWC), at that time the 
sole shelter in the Houston area offering sanc-
tuary to victims and women at risk of domestic 
violence. 
Despite its import, VAWA has been expired 
since September 30, 2018, and we as a body 
are now called upon by survivors to reauthor-
ize it. 
VAWA has a proven success record—in the 
quarter-century since it passed, domestic vio-
lence has decreased by approximately two- 
thirds, and intimate partner homicides de-
creased by approximately one-third. 
However, despite these gains, domestic vio-
lence and sexual assault cases I have rapidly 
increased during this COVID–19 crisis, where 
perpetrators are spending significant amount 
of time at home with their victims. 
This landmark, transformative legislation is 
needed now more than ever. 
Police departments around the country have 
reported increases in domestic violence: 18 
percent increase in San Antonio; 22 percent 
increase in Portland, Oregon; 10 percent in-
crease in New York City. 
A recent meta-analysis of 18 different stud-
ies concerning domestic violence during the 
pandemic found that domestic violence cases 
have increased an average of over 8 percent 
across the country. 
In the United States, an estimated 10 million 
people experience domestic violence every 
year, and more than 15 million children are 
exposed to this violence annually. 
According to the National Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence, about 20 people per 
minute are physically abused by an intimate 
partner. 
About 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experi-
ence severe intimate partner physical vio-
lence, sexual violence, and/or partner stalking 
with injury. 
Today, in Texas, 35.10 percent of women 
and 34.5 percent of men are subjected to do-
mestic violence. 
We cannot forget the victims of domestic vi-
olence like Yashica Fontenot, who was mur-
dered in Harris County, Texas, by her hus-
band just one day after Christmas last year 
while she was trying to escape her relation-
ship. 
Nor can we forget Debra Seidenfaden, who 
was murdered by her husband in Houston 
after an argument. 
Nor can we forget the Houston woman who 
was tied up and sexually assaulted in her own 
home just last week; or the Houston woman 
who was shot multiple times by her husband 
at a medical office this month; or the Houston 
mother and grandmother who was murdered 
by her son-in law while she attempted to pro-
tect her daughter and grandchildren. 
There are countless stories like this through-
out this country, which is why it is imperative 
to reauthorize VAWA by passing H.R. 1620. 
The stories of these women remind us of 
the urgency to protect survivors now, before it 
is too late, because many of these deaths are 
preventable. 
Since VAWA’s codification in 1994, more 
victims report episodes of domestic violence to 
the police and the rate of non-fatal intimate 
partner violence against women has de-
creased by almost two-thirds. 
VAWA has also led to a significant increase 
in the reporting of sexual assault. 
From 1994 to 2015, the rate of women mur-
dered by men in single victim/single offender 
incidents dropped 29 percent. 
In the first 15 years of VAWA’s validity, 
rates of serious intimate partner violence de-
clined by 72 percent for women and 64 per-
cent for men. 
Research suggests that referring a victim to 
a domestic violence or sexual assault advo-
cate has been linked to an increased willing-
ness to file a police report—survivors with an 
advocate filed a report with law enforcement 
59 percent of the time, versus 41 percent for 
individuals not referred to a victim advocate. 
Prior to VAWA, law enforcement lacked the 
resources and tools to respond effectively to 
domestic violence and sexual assault, and this 
progress cannot be allowed to stop. 
Congress must continue sending the clear 
message that violence against women is un-
acceptable. 
VAWA has been reauthorized three times— 
in 2000, 2005, and 2013—with strong bipar-
tisan approval and overwhelming support from 
Congress, states, and local communities. 
Each reauthorization of VAWA has im-
proved protections for women and men, while 
helping to change the culture and reduce the 
tolerance for these crimes. 
H.R. 1620 continues that tradition, and 
therefore, is intended to make modifications, 
as Congress has done in the past to all pre-
vious reauthorizations of VAWA. 
H.R. 1620 is a bipartisan bill, reflecting a 
reasonable and compromise approach to re-
authorize grant programs under the Violence 
Against Women Act (VAWA). 
These moderate enhancements will address 
the many growing and unmet needs of victims 
and survivors of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, sexual assault, and stalking. 
H.R. 1620 addresses the needs of sex traf-
ficking victims while creating a demonstration 
program on trauma-informed training for law 
enforcement. 
H.R. 1620 increases access to grant pro-
grams for culturally specific organizations and 
ensure culturally specific organizations are in-
cluded in the development and implementation 
of service, education, training, and other 
grants. 
H.R. 1620 adds a purpose area to assist 
communities in developing alternatives to 
housing ordinances that punish survivors for 
seeking law enforcement intervention. 
H.R. 1620 expands protections for vulner-
able populations such as youth, survivors with-
out shelter, Native American women, and 
LGBTQ persons. 
H.R. 1620 ensures Deaf people are in-
cluded in grants relating to people with disabil-
ities. 
VAWA is central to our nation’s effort to 
fight the epidemic of domestic, sexual, and

dating violence and stalking, and we as a 
body are now called upon by survivors to re-
authorize it. 
It is important to note that H.R. 1620 did not 
happen on its own. 
It was the product of a collaborative effort of 
stakeholders, including victim advocates. 
It was the product of those willing to share 
their stories of the abuse suffered at the 
hands of those who were entrusted to love, 
but instead harmed. 
The courage, strength, and resilience dis-
played by survivors has reminded all that we 
must continue to foster an environment for vic-
tims of violence to come forward and expose 
episodes of violence against women. 
Having listened to concerned stakeholders 
from all pockets of the country, we have put 
pen to paper and produced a bill that is en-
dorsed by the bipartisan National Task Force 
to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), 
which is a national collaboration comprising a 
large and diverse group of 35 national, tribal, 
state, territorial, and local organizations, advo-
cates, and individuals that focus on the devel-
opment, passage and implementation of effec-
tive public policy to address domestic vio-
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking. 
This bill recognizes the urgency and dire 
need faced by the victims and survivors 
throughout this country during a significant 
moment of ongoing domestic violence caused 
by this pandemic and experienced by both 
women and men. 
The love for a spouse, the comfort of a 
mother and the best wishes for a sister know 
no political allegiance. 
I am determined to work with my colleagues 
and others to complete the mission I accepted 
in the 115th Congress when the House 
passed the VAWA legislation I authored, H.R. 
1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthor-
ization Act of 2018, all the way this time 
through passage by the Senate and to pre-
sentment for signature to President Biden, a 
strong supporter of the bill and the original 
creator of VAWA. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SPANBERGER). All time for debate has 
expired. 
Pursuant to Resolution 233, the pre-
vious question is ordered. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the joint resolu-
tion. 
The joint resolution was ordered to 
be engrossed and read a third time, and 
was read the third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the passage of the joint

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

TITLE VII—ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR 
VICTIMS 
SEC. 701. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual vio-
lence, and 1 in 5 women have survived com-
pleted or attempted rape. Such violence has a 
devastating impact on women’s physical and 
emotional health, financial security, and ability 
to maintain their jobs, and thus impacts inter-
state commerce and economic security. 
(2) The Office on Violence Against Women of 
the Department of Justice defines domestic vio-
lence as a pattern of abusive behavior in any re-
lationship that is used by one intimate partner 
to gain or maintain power and control over an-
other intimate partner. Domestic violence can 
include physical, sexual, emotional, economic, 
or psychological actions or threats of actions 
that influence another person. Domestic vio-
lence includes any behaviors that intimidate, 
manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, ter-
rorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or 
wound an individual. 
(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention report that domestic violence or intimate 
partner violence is a serious public health issue 
for millions of individuals in the United States. 
Nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men in the 
United States have suffered sexual violence, 
physical violence, or stalking by an intimate 
partner. 
(4) Transgender and gender non-conforming 
people face extraordinary levels of physical and 
sexual violence. 
(5) More than 1 in 4 transgender people have 
faced bias-driven assault, and this rate is higher 
for trans women and trans people of color. 
(6) The American Foundation for Suicide Pre-
vention has found that transgender and gender 
non-conforming people had an elevated preva-
lence of suicide attempts, especially when they 
have suffered physical or sexual violence. 
(7) Homicide is one of the leading causes of 
death for women on the job. Domestic partners 
or relatives commit 43 percent of workplace 
homicides against women. One study found that 
intimate partner violence resulted in 142 homi-
cides among women at work in the United States 
from 2003 to 2008, a figure which represents 22 
percent of the 648 workplace homicides among 
women during the period. In fact, in 2010, homi-
cides against women at work increased by 13 
percent despite continuous declines in overall 
workplace homicides in recent years. 
(8) Women in the United States are 11 times 
more likely to be murdered with guns than 
women in other high-income countries. Female 
intimate partners are more likely to be murdered 
with a firearm than all other means combined. 
The presence of a gun in domestic violence situ-
ations increases the risk of homicide for women 
by 500 percent. 
(9) Violence can have a dramatic impact on 
the survivor of such violence. Studies indicate 
that 44 percent of surveyed employed adults ex-
perienced the effect of domestic violence in the 
workplace, and 64 percent indicated their work-
place performance was affected by such vio-
lence. Another recent survey found that 78 per-
cent of offenders used workplace resources to 
express anger, check up on, pressure, or threat-
en a survivor. Sexual assault, whether occurring 
in or out of the workplace, can impair an em-
ployee’s work performance, require time away 
from work, and undermine the employee’s abil-
ity to maintain a job. Nearly 50 percent of sex-
ual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced 
to quit in the aftermath of the assaults. 
(10) Studies find that 60 percent of single 
women lack economic security and 81 percent of 
households with single mothers live in economic 
insecurity. Significant barriers that survivors 
confront include access to housing, transpor-
tation, and child care. Ninety-two percent of 
homeless women have experienced domestic vio-
lence, and more than 50 percent of such women 
cite domestic violence as the direct cause for 
homelessness. Survivors are deprived of their 
autonomy, liberty, and security, and face tre-
mendous threats to their health and safety. 
(11) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention report that survivors of severe intimate 
partner violence lose nearly 8 million days of 
paid work, which is the equivalent of more than 
32,000 full-time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of 
household productivity each year. Therefore, 
women disproportionately need time off to care 
for their health or to find safety solutions, such 
as obtaining a restraining order or finding hous-
ing, to avoid or prevent further violence. 
(12) Annual costs of intimate partner violence 
are estimated to be more than $8,300,000,000. Ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the costs of intimate partner vio-
lence against women in 1995 exceeded an esti-
mated $5,800,000,000. These costs included near-
ly $4,100,000,000 in the direct costs of medical 
and 
mental 
health 
care 
and 
nearly 
$1,800,000,000 in the indirect costs of lost pro-
ductivity. These statistics are generally consid-
ered to be underestimated because the costs as-
sociated with the criminal justice system are not 
included. 
(13) Fifty-five percent of senior executives re-
cently surveyed said domestic violence has a 
harmful effect on their company’s productivity, 
and more than 70 percent said domestic violence 
negatively affects attendance. Seventy-eight 
percent of human resources professionals con-
sider partner violence a workplace issue. How-
ever, more than 70 percent of United States 
workplaces have no formal program or policy 
that addresses workplace violence, let alone do-
mestic violence. In fact, only four percent of em-
ployers provided training on domestic violence. 
(14) Studies indicate that one of the best pre-
dictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay 
away from his or her abuser is the degree of his 
or her economic independence. However, domes-
tic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking often negatively impact a survivor’s 
ability to maintain employment. 
(15) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial 
control over their partners by actively inter-
fering with their ability to work, including pre-
venting their partners from going to work, 
harassing their partners at work, limiting their 
partners’ access to cash or transportation, and 
sabotaging their partners’ child care arrange-
ments. 
(16) Economic abuse refers to behaviors that 
control an intimate partner’s ability to acquire, 
use, and maintain access to, money, credit, own-
ership of assets, or access to governmental or 
private financial benefits, including defaulting 
on joint obligations (such as school loans, credit 
card debt, mortgages, or rent). Other forms of 
such abuse may include preventing someone 
from attending school, threatening to or actu-
ally terminating employment, controlling or 
withholding access to cash, checking, or credit 
accounts, and attempting to damage or sabotage

the creditworthiness of an intimate partner, in-
cluding forcing an intimate partner to write bad 
checks, forcing an intimate partner to default 
on payments related to household needs, such 
as housing, or forcing an intimate partner into 
bankruptcy. 
(17) The Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (Public Law 111–148), and the amend-
ments made by such Act, ensures that most 
health plans must cover preventive services, in-
cluding screening and counseling for domestic 
violence, at no additional cost. In addition, it 
prohibits insurance companies from discrimi-
nating against patients for preexisting condi-
tions, like domestic violence. 
(18) Yet, more can be done to help survivors. 
Federal law in effect on the day before the date 
of enactment of this Act does not explicitly— 
(A) authorize survivors of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to 
take leave from work to seek legal assistance 
and redress, counseling, or assistance with safe-
ty planning activities; 
(B) address the eligibility of survivors of do-
mestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, 
or stalking for unemployment compensation; 
(C) provide job protection to survivors of do-
mestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, 
or stalking; or 
(D) prohibit insurers from disclosing informa-
tion about abuse and the location of the sur-
vivors through insurance databases and other 
means. 
(19) This Act aims to empower survivors of do-
mestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, 
or stalking to be free from violence, hardship, 
and control, which restrains basic human rights 
to freedom and safety in the United States.

TITLE IX—SAFETY FOR INDIAN WOMEN 
SEC. 901. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) American Indians and Alaska Natives are 
2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes— 
and at least 2 times more likely to experience 
rape or sexual assault crimes—compared to all 
other races. 
(2) More than 4 in 5 American Indian and 
Alaska Native women, or 84.3 percent, have ex-
perienced violence in their lifetime. 
(3) The vast majority of Native victims—96 
percent of women and 89 percent of male vic-
tims—report being victimized by a non-Indian. 
(4) Native victims of sexual violence are three 
times as likely to have experienced sexual vio-
lence by an interracial perpetrator as non-His-
panic White victims and Native stalking victims 
are nearly 4 times as likely to be stalked by 
someone of a different race. 
(5) While Tribes exercising jurisdiction over 
non-Indians have reported significant successes, 
the inability to prosecute crimes related to the 
Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction 
crimes continues to leave Tribes unable to fully 
hold domestic violence offenders accountable. 
(6) Tribal prosecutors report that the majority 
of domestic violence cases involve children ei-
ther as witnesses or victims, and Department of 
Justice reports that American Indian and Alas-
ka Native children suffer exposure to violence at 
rates higher than any other race in the United 
States. 
(7) Childhood exposure to violence has imme-
diate and long-term effects, including: increased 
rates of altered neurological development, poor 
physical and mental health, poor school per-
formance, substance abuse, and overrepresenta-
tion in the juvenile justice system. 
(8) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, homicide is the third lead-
ing cause of death among American Indian and 
Alaska Native women between 10 and 24 years 
of age and the fifth leading cause of death for 
American Indian and Alaska Native women be-
tween 25 and 34 years of age. 
(9) On some reservations, Indian women are 
murdered at more than 10 times the national av-
erage. 
(10) According to a 2010 Government Account-
ability Office report, United States Attorneys 
declined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of vio-
lent crimes that occur in Indian country. 
(11) Investigation into cases of missing and 
murdered Indian women is made difficult for 
Tribal law enforcement agencies due to a lack of 
resources, such as— 
(A) necessary training, equipment, or funding; 
(B) a lack of interagency cooperation; 
(C) a lack of appropriate laws in place; and 
(D) a lack of access to Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement databases. 
(12) Domestic violence calls are among the 
most dangerous calls that law enforcement re-
ceives. 
(13) The complicated jurisdictional scheme 
that exists in Indian country— 
(A) has a significant negative impact on the 
ability to provide public safety to Indian com-
munities; 
(B) has been increasingly exploited by crimi-
nals; and 
(C) requires a high degree of commitment and 
cooperation among Tribal, Federal, and State 
law enforcement officials. 
(14) Restoring and enhancing local, Tribal ca-
pacity to address violence against women pro-
vides for greater local control, safety, account-
ability, and transparency. 
(15) In States with restrictive land settlement 
acts such as Alaska, ‘‘Indian country’’ is lim-
ited, resources for local Tribal responses either 
nonexistent or insufficient to meet the needs, ju-
risdiction unnecessarily complicated and in-
creases the already high levels of victimization 
of American Indian and Alaska Native women. 
According to the Tribal Law and Order Act 
Commission Report, Alaska Native women are 
over-represented in the domestic violence victim 
population by 250 percent; they comprise 19 per-
cent of the State population, but are 47 percent 
of reported rape victims. And among other In-
dian Tribes, Alaska Native women suffer the 
highest rates of domestic and sexual violence in 
the country. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this title 
are— 
(1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, 
State, Tribal, and local governments with re-
spect to responding to cases of domestic vio-
lence, dating violence, stalking, trafficking, sex-
ual violence, crimes against children, and as-
sault against Tribal law enforcement officers 
and murdered Indians; 
(2) to increase coordination and communica-
tion among Federal, State, Tribal, and local law 
enforcement agencies; 
(3) to empower Tribal governments with the 
resources and information necessary to effec-
tively respond to cases of domestic violence, dat-
ing violence, stalking, sex trafficking, sexual vi-
olence, and missing and murdered Indians; and 
(4) to increase the collection of data related to 
missing and murdered Indians and the sharing 
of information among Federal, State, and Tribal 
officials responsible for responding to and inves-
tigating cases of missing and murdered Indians.

TITLE XVI—KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE 
FROM FAMILY VIOLENCE 
SEC. 1601. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Keeping Chil-
dren Safe From Family Violence Act’’ or 
‘‘Kayden’s Law’’. 
SEC. 1602. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Approximately one in 15 million children 
are exposed each year to domestic violence. 
(2) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the fam-
ily and by a parent. Intimate partner violence 
and child abuse overlap in the same families at 
rates of 30 to 60 percent. A child’s risk of abuse 
increases after a perpetrator of intimate partner 
violence separates from their domestic partner, 
even when the perpetrator had not previously 
directly abused the child. Children who have 
witnessed intimate partner violence are approxi-
mately four times more likely to experience di-
rect child maltreatment than children who have 
not witnessed intimate partner violence. 
(4) More than 75 percent of child sexual abuse 
is perpetrated by a family member or a person 
known to the child. U.S. Department of Justice 
data shows that family members are almost half 
(49 percent) of the perpetrators of child sex as-
sault victims under age 6. 
(5) Research suggests a child’s exposure to a 
batterer is among the strongest indicators of risk 
of incest victimization. One study found female 
children whose fathers were batterers of the 
mother were six-and-a-half times more likely to 
experience father-daughter incest than female 
children who do not have an abusive father. 
(6) Child abuse is a major public health issue 
in the United States. Total lifetime financial 
costs associated with just one year of confirmed 
cases of child maltreatment (including child 
physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological 
abuse and neglect) results in $124 billion in an-
nual costs to the U.S. economy, or approxi-
mately one percent of the gross domestic prod-
uct. 
(7) Empirical research indicates that allega-
tions of child physical and sexual abuse are reg-
ularly discounted by courts when raised in child 
custody cases, with fewer than one-fourth of 
claims that a father has committed child phys-
ical or sexual abuse believed; and where the al-
legedly abusive parent claimed the mother was 
‘‘alienating’’ the child, only 1 out of 51 claims of 
sexual molestation by a father were believed. 
Independent research indicates that child sex-
ual abuse allegations are credible 50 to 70 per-
cent of the time. 
(8) Empirical research shows that alleged or 
known abusive parents are often granted cus-
tody or unprotected parenting time by courts. 
Approximately one-third of parents alleged to 
have committed child abuse took primary cus-
tody from the protective parent reporting the 
abuse, placing children at ongoing risk. 
(9) Researchers have documented nearly 800 
children murdered in the United States since 
2008 by a divorcing or separating parent. More

March 17, 2021 
than 100 of these child murders are known to 
have occurred after a court ordered the child 
into contact with the dangerous parent over the 
objection of a safe parent or caregiver. 
(10) Scientifically unsound theories that treat 
mothers’ abuse allegations as likely false at-
tempts to undermine the father are frequently 
applied in family court to minimize or deny par-
ents’ and children’s reports of abuse. Many ex-
perts who testify against abuse allegations lack 
expertise in the relevant type of alleged abuse, 
relying instead on unsound and unproven theo-
ries. 
(11) Judges presiding over custody cases with 
allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, 
and domestic violence are rarely required to re-
ceive training on these subjects, nor have most 
states established standards for such trainings. 
SEC. 1603. PURPOSES. 
The purposes of this title are to: 
(1) increase the priority given to child safety 
in any private state court proceeding affecting 
children’s care and custody, excluding child 
protective and social service proceedings; 
(2) strengthen courts’ abilities to recognize 
and adjudicate domestic violence and child 
abuse allegations based on valid, admissible evi-
dence, and to enter orders which protect and 
minimize the risk of harm to children as the first 
priority; and 
(3) ensure that professional personnel in-
volved in cases containing abuse allegations re-
ceive trauma-informed and culturally appro-
priate training on the dynamics, signs and im-
pact of domestic violence and child abuse, in-
cluding child sexual abuse. 
SEC. 1604. DEFINITION OF COVERED FORMULA 
GRANT. 
The term ‘‘covered formula grant’’ means a 
grant under part T of title I of the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 
U.S.C. 10441 et seq.) (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘STOP Violence Against Women Formula 
Grant Program’’). 
SEC. 1605. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA 
GRANTS AUTHORIZED. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Attorney General shall 
increase the amount provided to a State under 
the covered formula grants in accordance with 
this title if— 
(1) EVIDENCE.— 
(A) EXPERTS.—The State has in place a law 
ensuring that, in a custody proceeding where a 
parent has been alleged to have committed do-
mestic violence or child abuse, including child 
sexual abuse, evidence from court-appointed or 
outside professionals regarding the alleged 
abuse may be admitted only when the profes-
sional possesses demonstrated expertise and 
clinical, not solely forensic, experience in work-
ing with victims of domestic violence or child 
abuse, including child sexual abuse. 
(B) NON-EXPERTS.—The State has in place a 
law ensuring that, in a custody proceeding 
where a parent has been alleged to have com-
mitted domestic violence or child abuse, includ-
ing child sexual abuse, evidence of past sexual 
or physical abuse committed by a party, includ-
ing but not limited to any past or current pro-
tection from abuse orders, sexual violence abuse 
protection orders, arrests, or convictions, must 
be considered in determining the truth of any 
allegations of family violence. 
(2) EXPERTS.—The State has in place uniform 
required standards of domestic violence and 
child abuse expertise and experience for all 
court-appointed neutral professional opinions 
related to abuse, trauma, and the behaviors of 
victims and perpetrators, which meet the criteria 
in paragraph (1)(A). 
(3) REMEDIES FOR A CHILD’S RESISTANCE TO 
CONTACT
WITH
A
PARENT.—The state has in 
place a law ensuring that— 
(A) NO
REMOVAL
OF
CARE
FROM
SAFE
PAR-
ENT.—No child shall be removed from the care of 
a competent protective, non-physically or sexu-
ally abusive parent or litigating party to whom 
the child is bonded or attached, nor shall the 
child’s contact with such parent be restricted, 
solely in order to improve a deficient relation-
ship with the other parent. 
(B) REUNIFICATION TREATMENT.—No ‘‘reunifi-
cation treatment’’ may be ordered by the court 
without scientifically valid and generally ac-
cepted proof of the safety, effectiveness and 
therapeutic value of the particular treatment, 
nor may any treatment predicated on cutting off 
a child from the parent to whom they are bond-
ed or attached be ordered. 
(C) CAUSES OF CHILD RESISTANCE.—Any order 
to remediate a child’s contact resistance must 
address the resisted parent’s behaviors or con-
tributions to the child’s resistance first, before 
ordering the preferred parent to take steps to 
potentially improve the child’s relationship with 
the parent they resist. 
(4) TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—The state has in place an 
ongoing education and training program for 
judges and magistrates who hear custody mat-
ters, and relevant court personnel, including 
guardians ad litem, best interest attorneys, 
counsel for children, custody evaluators, mas-
ters, and mediators, focusing solely on domestic 
violence and child abuse, including—

by — 
(i) professionals with substantial experience in 
assisting survivors of domestic violence or child 
abuse, such as a victim service provider; and 
(ii) where possible, survivors of domestic vio-
lence, or child physical or sexual abuse. 
(C) EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—The education and training 
program in subparagraph (A) shall rely on evi-
dence-based and peer-reviewed research by rec-
ognized experts in the types of abuse designated 
under this section. 
(ii) EXCLUSION.—The education and training 
program shall not include theories, concepts, 
and belief systems unsupported by valid, cred-
ible scientific research. 
(D) OBJECTIVE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
PROGRAM.—The education and training program 
shall be designed to improve the ability of courts 
to recognize and respond to child physical 
abuse, child sexual abuse, domestic violence, 
and trauma on all family victims, particularly 
children, and make appropriate custody deci-
sions that prioritize child safety and well-being, 
and shall be culturally sensitive and appro-
priate for diverse communities. 
(E) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.—Judges and all 
other personnel identified in subparagraph (A) 
must receive at least 60 hours of initial training 
on these identified topics, and at least 20 hours 
of this ongoing training every two years.

evaluator shall, at a minimum, hold a Master’s 
degree in a relevant field and must have com-
pleted the training requirements of subpara-
graph (E). 
(4) LEGAL REPRESENTATION.—The state shall 
notify parties of the importance of legal rep-
resentation and shall direct the parties to ap-
propriate resources. 
(b) GRANT INCREASE.—The amount of the in-

cent awards to the State. 
SEC. 1606. APPLICATION. 
A State seeking a grant under this title shall 
submit an application to the Attorney General 
at such time, in such manner, and containing 
such information as the Attorney General may 
reasonably require, including information re-
garding the law described in section 1605. 
SEC. 1607. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this title shall be interpreted to 
discourage States from adopting additional pro-

SEC. 1608. GRANT TERM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The term of a covered grant 
shall be for one year. 
(b) RENEWAL.—A State that receives a covered 
grant may submit an application for a renewal 
of such grant at such time, in such manner, and

SEC. 1610. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There is authorized to be appropriated to 
carry out this title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal 
years 2022 through 2026. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 1620. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act, or VAWA, was 
signed into law in 1994 to help ensure 
that women in America are free from 
violence and free from fear. At the 
time that VAWA was enacted, it was 
all too common for violent crimes 
against women to go without appro-
priate 
response 
and 
to 
remain 
unaddressed by the criminal justice 
system. 
But through programs implemented 
under VAWA, Congress began to help 
provide communities in America the 
assistance they need to combat the 
crimes of domestic violence, dating vi-
olence, sexual assault, and stalking. 
Building on this success, H.R. 1620 is 
bipartisan legislation that reauthorizes 
and strengthens the Violence Against 
Women Act so that it can continue de-
livering vital services to those in need. 
VAWA, which is not gender-exclu-
sive, addresses the needs of men and 
women, children, persons with disabil-
ities, homeless persons, and LGBTQ in-
dividuals, among others. 
This reauthorization would also in-
crease access to grant programs for

culturally specific organizations and 
ensure that such organizations are in-
cluded in the development and imple-
mentation of service, education, train-
ing, and other grants. The range of in-
dividuals VAWA helps is broad and 
should be as diverse as our commu-
nities around the country. I am pleased 
that this reauthorization continues our 
commitment to this principle. 
VAWA has had, and continues to 
have, a positive impact on people who 
rely on its assistance, whether directly 
or indirectly. 
Through grants to State and local 
governments, the Office on Violence 
Against Women in the Department of 
Justice funds the work of thousands of 
advocates in preventing and addressing 
domestic violence, dating violence, sex-
ual assault and stalking, and in assist-
ing and training law enforcement and 
victim advocates. 
In 
addition, 
grants 
administered 
through the Department of Health and 
Human Services provide funds for shel-
ters, rape prevention and education, 
programs to address and reduce the 
sexual abuse of runaway and homeless 
youth, and programs to educate the 
community on domestic violence. The 
reach of the work carried out under 
VAWA is vast, and we must continue to 
support it. 
This legislation expands services for 
older survivors of abuse and for pro-
grams targeting rural areas. It also ex-
pands the jurisdiction of some Tribal 
authorities over non-Indians who com-
mit certain crimes on Tribal lands to 
ensure that they are held accountable. 
Like the legislation the House passed 
last Congress, it also includes provi-
sions protecting transgender individ-
uals, and it bans individuals convicted 
of domestic abuse from purchasing fire-
arms. 
The Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act is comprehensive and 
inclusive legislation that I hope will 
earn further bipartisan support in the 
long tradition of this vital law. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), the 
chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security Subcommittee and 
the sponsor of this legislation, and the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
FITZPATRICK) 
for 
their 
outstanding 
leadership in the effort to reauthorize 
VAWA. 
I also want to thank the advocates, 
many of whom are survivors them-
selves, for the countless hours they 
have put into improving this legisla-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself an additional 15 seconds. 
Their efforts, and those of many 
other Members, have produced this im-
portant bill that will not only continue 
the progress enabled by VAWA as origi-
nally enacted but will also make the 
act an even more effective tool in ad-
dressing the horrible scourge of domes-
tic violence. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR, 
Washington, DC, March 10, 2021. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
NADLER: I write con-
cerning H.R. 1620, the Violence Against 
Women Reauthorization Act of 2021. This bill 
was primarily referred to the Committee on 
the Judiciary, and additionally to the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor and other 
committees. As a result of Leadership and 
the Committee on the Judiciary having con-
sulted with me concerning this bill gen-
erally, I agree to forgo formal consideration 
of the bill so the bill may proceed expedi-
tiously to the House floor. 
The Committee on Education and Labor 
takes this action with our mutual under-
standing that by forgoing formal consider-
ation of H.R. 1620, we do not waive any juris-
diction over the subject matter contained in 
this or similar legislation, and we will be ap-
propriately consulted and involved as the 
bill or similar legislation moves forward so 
we may address any remaining issues within 
our Rule X jurisdiction. I also request that 
you support my request to name members of 
the Committee on Education and Labor to 
any conference committee to consider such 
provisions. 
Finally, I would appreciate a response con-
firming this understanding and ask that a 
copy of our exchange of letters on this mat-
ter be included in the Congressional Record 
during floor consideration of H.R. 1620. 
Very truly yours, 
ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, March 15, 2021. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT: I am in receipt of 
your March 10, 2021, letter regarding H.R. 
1620, the ‘‘Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act of 2021.’’ 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this legislation. I recognize that 
the bill contains provisions that fall within 
the jurisdiction of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. I acknowledge that your 
Committee will not formally consider H.R. 
1620 and agree that the inaction of your 
Committee with respect to the bill does not 
waive any future jurisdictional claim over 
the matters contained in H.R. 1620 which fall 
within your Committee’s Rule X jurisdic-
tion. 
I will ensure that our exchange of letters is 
included in the Congressional Record during 
floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate 
your cooperation regarding this legislation 
and look forward to continuing to work with 
you as this measure moves through the legis-
lative process. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The Violence Against Women Act 
was first signed into law almost 30 
years ago with wide bipartisan support. 
The law recognizes that Federal laws 
covering domestic violence could help 
ease overburdened State and local 
criminal justice systems. It was nar-
rowly defined and not controversial. 
Since its passage, it has been reauthor-
ized on a bipartisan basis. 
Unfortunately, 
in 
recent 
years, 
Democrats have politicized the law, 
straying further and further away from 
its original intent. This bill, H.R. 1620, 
is a continuation of the Democrats’ 
politicization, expanding and altering 
the fundamental nature of the Violence 
Against Women Act. 
The most significant change in this 
reauthorization effort is that it erases 
important distinctions between women 
and men. It replaces violence against 
‘‘women’’ with ‘‘a person of any gen-
der,’’ extending the law’s protections 
well-past the narrowly defined and nec-
essary protection for women. 
This 
rewriting 
of 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act not only under-
mines the original intent of this legis-
lation, but also jeopardizes the safety 
and well-being of women at risk. It 
does more to advance the Democrats’ 
progressive agenda than it does to pro-
tect women. 
It is not just VAWA. The Democrats’ 
entire radical agenda hurts women. 
Calls to defund, dismantle, and rethink 
local law enforcement hurt at-risk 
women. 
Never-ending 
government 
lockdowns that require battered and 
abused women to stay in violent house-
holds hurt women. A southern border 
open to dangerous drug cartels and 
human traffickers caused by President 
Biden’s border crisis hurts women. In 
fact, the Democrats’ open border poli-
cies incentivize women to make the 
dangerous trip to the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der on which one-third of women report 
being sexually abused. 
Those are not the only problems with 
this legislation. H.R. 1620 also threat-
ens Americans’ constitutional right to 
religious freedom. The bill denies faith- 
based exemptions for VAWA grant re-
cipients, prohibiting religious organi-
zations from running shelters and legal 
aid centers on the basis of their sin-
cerely held religious beliefs. The Demo-
crats’ culture war could actually force 
faith-based centers for abused women 
to close. 
H.R. 1620 also expands the definition 
of domestic violence to include eco-
nomic and emotional duress, pulling 
funding away from combating the se-
verity of violent crimes. 
This legislation disregards the well- 
being of women by promoting lofty 
concepts, such as restorative justice 
approaches to crimes against women, 
which are unproven and could force a 
woman to confront her abuser. 
Democrats know that these are un-
necessary additions that jeopardize the 
bipartisan reauthorization, so why are 
they choosing to proceed? Why are 
they putting forward this bill—with no 
hearings, no markups in this Con-
gress—at the expense of women’s safe-
ty and well-being? 
Any crime or abuse against any sin-
gle individual is abhorrent. State and 
Federal laws already protect individ-
uals, women and men, from domestic 
violence and sexual abuse and any re-
lated reprehensible acts like dating vi-
olence and stalking. Resources should

be targeted to help those women and 
individuals cope and recover and also 
prevent further violence and abuse. 
This bill falls short of that goal and 
wildly distorts the original purpose of 
this law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to oppose this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, I stand today in a 
moment of history where we cannot go 
back. Have we heard that before? 
Women cannot go back. Women cannot 
continue in an intimidated fashion to 
tragically be subjected to men who vio-
lently attack them. 
The LGBT community cannot go 
back and be subjected to those who 
would be violent against them. 
Native American women cannot go 
back. They cannot go back. They can-
not go back to pueblos and reserva-
tions and not have any protection for 
those who violate those sacred places, 
rape them, and then rush to jurisdic-
tions outside and think they are pro-
tected. 
Immigrant women cannot go back. 
That is what this legislation is 
about. It is a product borne of meticu-
lous 
and 
thoughtful 
research 
and 
countless engagement with those on 
the ground working ultimately and in-
timately on these very important 
issues daily. 
We began this long journey and hard- 
fought battle under the leadership of 
Republicans—I wrote the bill in 2018— 
who at the time refused to engage in 
putting forward their own version of 
VAWA when it expired in 2018 while 
they held the majority. The President, 
the Senate, the House, they did noth-
ing. The Judiciary Committee would 
not even take the bill up, and it was 
supported by over 200 groups. 
But we continue to push forward on 
behalf of all victims and survivors to 
reauthorize 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act of 1994, first led by the 
President of the United States, then- 
Senator Joe Biden. 
As we all know, VAWA is a landmark 
piece of legislation first enacted in 
1994. At that time, the President was 
Bill Clinton. This legislation was en-
acted in response to the prevalence of 
domestic and sexual violence and the 
significant impact of such violence on 
the lives of women. 
Statistics have revealed that this 
form of violence impacts us all. In the 
United States, an estimated 10 million 
people experience domestic violence 
every year. More than 15 million chil-
dren are exposed to violence annually. 
According to the National Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence, about 20 
people 
per 
minute 
are 
physically 
abused by an intimate partner. About 
one in four women and one in nine men 
experience 
severe 
intimate 
partner 
physical violence, sexual violence, and 
a partner stalking injury. 
Today, in Texas, 35 percent of women 
and 34 percent of men are subjected to 
domestic violence. When discussing 
VAWA, we cannot forget the victims of 
domestic violence like Ms. Fontenot, 
who was murdered in Harris County by 
her husband just 1 day after Christmas 
last year while she was trying to es-
cape her relationship, and he shot at 
her son. 
Nor 
can 
we 
forget 
Debora 
Seidenfaden, who was murdered by her 
husband in Houston after an argument. 
There are countless stories like this 
throughout the country. That is why it 
is imperative that we reauthorize this 
bill. Enough is enough. We must pass 
H.R. 1620 now. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all the 
women, 
including 
Representative 
Slaughter, who started this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 1620, the ‘‘Violence Against Women Act 
of 2021.’’ 
H.R. 1620 is a product born of meticulous 
and thoughtful research and countless en-
gagement with those on the ground, working 
intimately on these very important issues daily. 
We began this long journey, and hard- 
fought battle under the leadership of Repub-
licans, who at the time refused to engage or 
put forward their own version of VAWA when 
it expired in 2018 while they held the majority. 
But we continued to push forward on behalf 
of all victims and survivors to reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994. 
As we all know, VAWA is a landmark piece 
of legislation first enacted in 1994 and signed 
into law by President Bill Clinton as part of the 
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement 
Act of 1994. 
This legislation was enacted in response to 
the prevalence of domestic and sexual vio-
lence, and the significant impact of such vio-
lence on the lives of women. 
Statistics have revealed that these form of 
violence impact us all. 
In the United States, an estimated 10 million 
people experience domestic violence every 
year, and more than 15 million children are 
exposed to this violence annually. According 
to the National Coalition Against Domestic Vi-
olence, about 20 people per minute are phys-
ically abused by an intimate partner. About 1 
in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe 
intimate partner physical violence, sexual vio-
lence, and/ or partner stalking with injury. 
Today, in Texas, 35.10 percent of women 
and 34.5 percent of men are subjected to do-
mestic violence. 
When discussing VAWA, we cannot forget 
the victims of domestic violence like Yashica 
Fontenot, who was murdered in Harris County, 
Texas by her husband just one day after 
Christmas last year while she was trying to es-
cape her relationship. 
Nor can we forget Debra Seidenfaden, who 
was murdered by her husband in Houston 
after an argument. 
There are countless stories like this through-
out this country. 
That is why it is imperative to reauthorize 
this law by passing H.R. 1620 now. Because 
enough is enough. 
Congress has reauthorized VAWA three 
times—in 2000, 2005, and 2013—with strong 
bipartisan approval and overwhelming support 
from Congress, States, and local communities. 
During each reauthorization, VAWA would 
make various meaningful improvements to the 
Act to meet the varied and changing needs of 
survivors. 
H.R. 1620 continues that tradition, and 
therefore, is intended to make modifications, 
as Congress has done in the past to all pre-
vious reauthorizations of VAWA. 
H.R. 1620 is a bipartisan bill, reflecting a 
reasonable and compromise approach to re-
authorize grant programs under the Violence 
Against Women Act (VAWA). 
These moderate enhancements will address 
the many growing and unmet needs of victims 
and survivors of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, sexual assault, and stalking. 
H.R. 1620 addresses the needs of sex traf-
ficking victims while creating a demonstration 
program on trauma-informed training for law 
enforcement. 
It increases access to grant programs for 
culturally specific organizations and ensure 
culturally specific organizations are included in 
the development and implementation of serv-
ice, education, training, and other grants. 
It adds a purpose area to assist commu-
nities in developing alternatives to housing or-
dinances that punish survivors for seeking law 
enforcement intervention. 
H.R. 1620 expands protections for vulner-
able populations such as youth, survivors with-
out shelter, Native American women, and 
LGBTQ persons. 
It ensures Deaf people are included in 
grants relating to people with disabilities. 
H.R. 1620 is supported by the National Task 
Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence 
Against Women, a coalition of more than 200 
domestic violence groups. 
VAWA expired since September 30, 2018, 
and we as a body are called upon by sur-
vivors to reauthorize it now. 
As a tribute to our dearly departed Rep. 
Slaughter, who started this journey with then, 
Senator Biden in 1994, I respectfully urge my 
colleagues to join me, and the Chairman of 
Judiciary, along with our Republican part-
ners—Mr. FITZPATRICK and Mr. MCCAUL in 
passing H.R. 1620, a much needed thoughtful 
and bipartisan response to the needs of all 
victims and survivors. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, Democrats are using domestic vio-
lence, which is a serious issue, as a 
front for just their latest gun control 
bill. This legislation contains red flag 
gun confiscation language and expands 
the grounds for lifetime bans of fire-
arm possession. 
Red flag gun confiscation laws upend 
due process. Under this legislation, an 
individual could have their guns re-
moved from them without having the 
chance to face their accuser in court. 
That means a complaint and a judicial 
order could suspend a constitutionally 
guaranteed right, with no chance for 
the accused to respond under the law. 
b 1145 
This legislation makes it clear that 
Democrats consider gun ownership a 
second-class right, if it is a right at all,

and view the Constitution as a nego-
tiable suggestion. 
This bill would expand the number of 
nonviolent misdemeanor offenses that 
produce a lifetime ban on firearm own-
ership, which is already applied to fel-
ons. 
It is ironic that in the same week 
that Democrats are voting in support 
of amnesty for illegal aliens who have 
committed up to two misdemeanors, 
they are voting to permanently sus-
pend the constitutional rights of Amer-
icans who have committed one non-
violent misdemeanor. 
I oppose this attempt to undermine 
due process, further restrict the Second 
Amendment, and expand the left’s rad-
ical and relentless gun control agenda. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON). 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, be-
fore coming to Congress, I organized 
volunteer lawyers to represent sur-
vivors of domestic abuse, so I have seen 
firsthand both the need for the Vio-
lence Against Women Act and the re-
markable impact of legal representa-
tion in moments of crisis. 
That is why I am proud to support re-
authorization of VAWA, which would, 
among other things, expand access to 
legal counsel for those who need it 
most. 
Too often, survivors are left to navi-
gate 
alone 
the 
overwhelming 
aftereffects of violence and abuse. 
Whether that means finding housing, 
medical, or other care in the aftermath 
of trauma, the process can be com-
plicated and hard to manage. 
Legal representation in these critical 
moments can make a life-changing dif-
ference. That is why I am proud to 
offer two amendments to VAWA today. 
The first would expand efforts to pro-
vide 
legal 
representation 
in 
postconviction relief proceedings. The 
second would increase access to legal 
aid for veterans who have unmet legal 
needs. 
Everyone deserves access to quality 
legal representation for fundamental 
needs, and this bill gets us one step 
closer to that goal. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support my amendments and 
the underlying legislation. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Protecting women and girls from vio-
lence and abuse and keeping them safe 
is deeply important to me and Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle. 
Shortly before I was first elected to 
Congress back in 1994, President Bill 
Clinton signed into law the Violence 
Against Women Act. It was the first 
iteration of a very good bill, which, if 
you can believe it, passed the House 
then by a voice vote. It was supported 
by all but four in the Senate. 
When it was reauthorized in the year 
2000, I supported it and voted for it, and 
in 2006, VAWA again had my full sup-
port. In fact, since I have been in Con-
gress, I have voted nearly a dozen 
times, both in the Judiciary Com-
mittee or here on the floor, to renew or 
strengthen the provisions of VAWA in 
an effort to do what we all can do to 
protect women who have been or will 
in the future be subjects of domestic 
violence, abuse, or other forms of har-
assment. 
Historically, this legislation has been 
a truly bipartisan effort. Sadly, the ef-
fort put forth today by the majority is 
anything but bipartisan. 
What has happened between then and 
now? It seems to me that many on the 
left decided that they could use this 
critical legislation that is intended to 
protect women and girls from violence 
as a vehicle to promote their far-left 
political agenda. To me, this is a dis-
turbing development, as the safety and 
well-being of all women and girls in 
this country is far too important to 
jeopardize with callous political cal-
culations that could further divide the 
American people. 
In fact, it is possible that passing 
this so-called VAWA reauthorization 
offered by the majority could result in 
some faith-based institutions shutting 
their shelter doors so that many 
women and girls who relied on their 
help, support, and protection wouldn’t 
have that protection. 
This legislation could force women 
seeking protection in shelters or incar-
cerated in prison to be housed along-
side biological males, potentially sub-
jecting those women to further psycho-
logical, mental, or physical harm. To 
me, it is unconscionable to be aware of 
these and other shortcomings of this 
legislation and simply ignore it. 
What should we do? We should con-
tinue to improve VAWA as we did prior 
to 2013. We should continue to protect 
those vulnerable individuals in our so-
ciety who rely on our help to protect 
them. And we should accomplish it in a 
bipartisan, bicameral manner, Repub-
licans and Democrats actually working 
together as we are capable of doing. 
It is time we put politics and polit-
ical agendas aside and reauthorize a 
Violence Against Women Act that con-
tinues to provide real protection for 
women and girls. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, unfortunately, when 
we talk about violence against women, 
we are often talking about domestic vi-
olence. Domestic violence claims the 
lives of far too many women, and it is 
especially deadly when it occurs in a 
household with a gun. 
In the United States, there are 1 mil-
lion women alive today who have re-
ported being shot or shot at by their 
intimate partners, and there are many 
more who have been threatened or 
killed with a gun. 
Closing the boyfriend loophole is a 
critical step to prevent abusers from 
obtaining a weapon, a weapon that will 
likely be used to escalate their abuse 
and a weapon that may have deadly 
consequences. 
With this bill, we can truly help pre-
vent abuse, protect our families, and 
keep every American safer. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this bill. 
This version of the Violence Against 
Women Act does not protect women. 
Instead, this bill puts partisan political 
priorities ahead of women in need. 
While my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle like to claim they are the 
party of women, this partisan reau-
thorization proves that they only put 
women first when it is convenient. 
I am a survivor of domestic violence 
from a previous marriage. I was afraid 
for my life, and I was afraid for my 
daughter’s life. Thankfully, I escaped 
that terrible situation. So I am inti-
mately familiar with the desperate sit-
uations many women who are victims 
of domestic abuse face. As a domestic 
violence survivor, I know just how im-
portant services and protections are to 
women across our Nation. 
Previous reauthorizations of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act have been bi-
partisan, but not this one. This version 
is filled with partisan priorities that 
force women’s domestic violence shel-
ters to take in men who identify as 
women, strip away protections for reli-
gious organizations, and eliminate Sec-
ond Amendment rights without due 
process. 
The most egregious provisions of this 
bill push leftist gender ideology at the 
expense of important protections for 
women’s privacy and safety. Sex-seg-
regated shelters provide a safe place 
for women who have been abused, often 
at the hands of men, and offer them a 
sense of privacy and security. If this 
bill is enacted, these shelters, under 
penalty of Federal law, would be re-
quired to take in men and shelter them 
with women, putting vulnerable women 
at risk. 
Religious objections are also under 
attack in this legislation. This bill ex-
cludes critical First Amendment pro-
tections for faith-based organizations. 
This almost certainly guarantees that 
attacks on religious organizations will 
continue over disagreements on reli-
gious liberty and gender ideology. 
This bill is also being used to change 
and erode Second Amendment rights 
for everyone by introducing a new pro-
vision that would lower the standard 
by which government can take away 
someone’s right to bear arms without 
due process, including for nonfelony 
crimes. 
Passing 
legislation 
that 
supports 
women who have been victims of do-
mestic abuse, trafficking, and sexual 
assault should be a bipartisan issue. In 
this partisan Violence Against Women

ority. Leftist ideology is the priority. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I

gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.

Ms. 
CLARK

Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
As the rates of COVID–19 spiked 
across the country, so did the rates of 
domestic violence. This pandemic with-
in the pandemic must be stopped, and 
before us are the tools to save lives and 
end the cycle of violence. 
The VAWA reauthorization makes 
crucial improvements to the law. It 
closes legal loopholes to stop violent 
partners from accessing firearms. It 
tackles the growing threat of online 
harassment by training law enforce-
ment on cybercrimes. It provides serv-
ices for survivors of dating violence, 
sexual assault, and stalking. And it im-
proves protections for Native women. 
Today, we stand up for everyone by 
providing safety everywhere, at home, 
at work, on campus, and online. 
Let us vote together to end domestic 
violence. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has demonstrated, 
once again, the vital importance of the 
Violence Against Women Act. 
With the Nation under stay-at-home 
orders, many women were unable to es-
cape their abusers or find help in their 
communities. 
Thanks to VAWA, organizations like 
the Rhode Island Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence were able to meet 
women where they are, despite these 
obstacles. 
In 2020, VAWA grants helped the 
Rhode Island Coalition Against Domes-
tic Violence assist over 9,000 survivors 
of domestic violence and answer over 
17,000 helpline calls, nearly a 12 percent 
increase from 2019. 
During the pandemic, through VAWA 
programs, Rhode Islanders have found 
transitional housing, received coun-
seling services, and obtained assistance 
with seeking restraining orders. 
Violence Against Women Act grants 
and programs can really be the dif-
ference between life or death. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1620, the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act of 
2021. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
ESCOBAR). 
Ms. 
ESCOBAR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since being signed into law, the Vio-
lence Against Women Act has become a 
crucial part of legislation to aid vic-
tims of sexual abuse and domestic vio-
lence. VAWA provides lifesaving pro-
grams to help survivors navigate do-
mestic violence and abuse situations. 
Madam Speaker, in my district, I 
heard from innumerable counselors, ac-
tivists, advocates, and attorneys about 
the toll the COVID–19 pandemic has 
taken on families, but especially fami-
lies who have to experience domestic 
violence. Being locked in a situation 
with your abuser, with your attacker, 
was incredibly dangerous, and there 
has been terrible trauma inflicted. 
We need to pass VAWA now. There is 
no reason not to support people who 
are victims of domestic violence. This 
is an enormous step forward. 
I am grateful to the leaders who 
brought this forward, and I rise in sup-
port. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I

from 
California 
(Ms. 
SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Violence Against Women Act. 
Twenty persons a minute are injured 
by an intimate partner; that is 10 mil-
lion American men and women every 
year. It is time to do something to con-
tinue this act and to extend it. 
Madam Speaker, I have a number of 
amendments that have been accepted. I 
especially 
want 
to 
point 
out 
the 
SHIELD Act, which combats the non-
consensual sharing of private, sexually 
explicit and nude images, commonly 
known as revenge porn, which now will 
be a crime. 
My other two amendments deal with 
creating a task force on sexual vio-
lence and education and directing the 
Secretary of Education to create cli-
mate surveys on student experiences 
with violence. Twenty percent of our 
college coeds are sexually assaulted or 
there are attempts of sexual assault on 
them each year. 
Finally, 
the 
last 
amendment 
incentivizes States to pass a Survivors’ 
Bill of Rights in the States Act, which 
is particularly important for rape kits.

gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. LOIS 
FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, consider this: Your 
spouse or partner calls you names, he 
insults you, puts you down. 
He discourages you from going to 
work or school or seeing family mem-
bers or friends. 
He tries to control how you spend 
your money, where you go, or who you 
can see, what medicines you take. 
He acts possessive, gets angry when 
drinking alcohol. 
He tries to control when you can see 
a doctor; threatens you with violence; 
and may hit, kick, shove, slap, choke, 
or otherwise hurt you, your children, 
your pets. 
He forces you to have sex against 
your will. He blames you for his violent 
behavior and tells you that you deserve 
it. 
And this comes from someone you 
love. 
You are in pain and embarrassed to 
ask for help. You are one in four 
women. The Violence Against Women 
Act is critical for your safety and eco-
nomic independence. 
Madam Speaker, I urge its passage. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. FLETCH-
ER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act. I 
thank my colleague from Houston, 
Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
for her leadership and her tireless ef-
forts to get this critical legislation to 
this House floor. 
The Violence Against Women Act 
provides essential support for survivors 
of domestic violence and sexual as-
sault, and its reauthorization now is 
vitally important, as many of my col-
leagues have shared. It is critical for 
organizations in my community that 
support survivors, like the Houston 
Area Women’s Center, which has re-
ported a dramatic rise in requests for 
their services through the coronavirus 
pandemic—more than 6,000 more calls 
responded to in 2020 alone. 
Madam Speaker, in 2020, the number 
of people the center sheltered tripled. 
Sadly, we have been reminded again 
today of the dangers that women face 
in our society. The Violence Against 
Women Act provides resources and 
services that are lifesaving. That is 
why I am proud to cosponsor this legis-
lation and to vote in support of it 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. BOW-

Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
as the son of a single mom and as the 
brother of four sisters. Unfortunately, I 
have heard stories of abuse and assault 
and neglect throughout my life. I also 
heard these stories from my students 
and 
the 
many 
families 
I 
served 
throughout my time in education. The 
consistency throughout these stories 
illustrate how there is no recourse and 
there are no safe spaces for women to 
go to when they are under assault and 
feeling abused.

fore joining Congress, I sat with a stu-
dent and her mom in my office to call

a domestic violence help hotline. And 
we stayed on hold for hours before any-
one came to the phone. There was no 
housing for them to go to in support of 
their safety. So I rise to support this 
legislation, and I rise to denounce the 
sexism and patriarchy and misogyny 
that continues to exist within our po-
litical arenas and within our laws. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mrs. 
LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in solidarity with the sur-
vivors of domestic and sexual violence. 
It is completely unacceptable that we 
have allowed the Violence Against 
Women Act to expire. 
I am proud to have introduced two 
amendments that will strengthen pro-
tections for our most vulnerable com-
munities. The first amendment will 
stop punishing children who have been 
sex-trafficked and have been in contact 
with the criminal justice system. The 
pandemic has also illustrated the ur-
gency on what we need to do to make 
sure that we reauthorize it. 
Madam Speaker, as Americans, we 
have had to follow stay-at-home or-
ders, and it has increased the amount 
of abuse among those who could not 
leave home. VAWA save lives. This 
isn’t a Democrat or Republican issue. 
It is justice and safety. It is time we 
get this done and reauthorize. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. I rise today in 
strong support of this legislation be-
cause it includes trans women. Some of 
the most brutal, horrific crimes cre-
ated in the minds of people have been 
perpetrated upon trans women. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation pro-
tects them, as it protects all women. I 
support it and I encourage my col-
leagues to do so as well. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, it 
is well past time for VAWA reauthor-
ization. It should have never been al-
lowed to lapse to begin with. 
I stand here in support of this bill in 
honor of Gladys Ricart, a dear con-
stituent of mine, who, 22 years ago, was 
murdered by her jealous ex-boyfriend 
on her wedding day, in her wedding 
gown. Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this legislation in her 
memory. 
Now you have the Brides’ March, an 
international movement across this 
continent and across the world that 
honors the memory of Gladys Ricart. 
They were right here in this Capitol, 
and they will continue to come back 
until further legislation is enacted to 
protect women all across our country, 
all across the world. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
STRICKLAND). 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
the tragic shootings in Atlanta yester-
day killed eight people—six of whom 
were Asian women. 
To the families of the victims, you 
have my deepest condolences. 
This crime has elements that we are 
trying to address here in Congress; gun 
violence, violence against women, and 
the meteoric rise of violence we are 
witnessing against the AAPI commu-
nity. 
Racially motivated violence must be 
called out for exactly what it is, and 
we must stop making excuses or re-
branding it as economic anxiety or sex-
ual addiction. 
Madam Speaker, as a woman who is 
Black and Korean, I am acutely aware 
of how it feels to be erased and ignored, 
and how the default position when vio-
lence is committed against people of 
color or women is to defer from con-
fronting the hate that is often the mo-
tivation. 
Madam Speaker, words matter and 
leadership matters. We must all loudly 
condemn actions and language rooted 
in fear and bigotry that harms all of 
us. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, a 
movement led by the Texas Council on 
Family Violence, and so many other 
advocates, first won passage of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act and brought 
the National Domestic Violence Hot-
line to Austin, which has now offered 5 
million lifesaving responses. This act 
brought much-needed funding and hope 
to women across America who led coa-
litions. 
Yet, the scourge of violence has con-
tinued. In San Antonio, a Collaborative 
led by Judges Monique Diaz and Peter 
Sakai 
has 
supplemented 
incredible 
Family Services led by Marta Peleaz 
and Patricia Castillo’s PEACE initia-
tive. I have joined them for two town 
halls to listen, learn, and respond. 
In Austin, Kelly White and Julia 
Spann continue the Safe Alliance, as 
Maria Johnson expands the Hays- 
Caldwell Center. But too many violent 
beatings have turned into killings. Be-
cause this reauthorization would close 
‘‘the boyfriend loophole,’’ denying a 
gun to an abusive partner, the NRA 
and its Congressional Republican allies 
have been blocking renewal. 
Today, we call on them to choose 
life, to recommit to VAWA, and foster 
a society where every person is treated 
with dignity. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
Speaker of the House (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and, 
again, for his extraordinary leadership. 
Madam Speaker, this is quite a day 
for the chairman, with the Violence 
Against Women Act and the ERA, 
among other pieces of legislation that 
he is bringing to the floor. I thank him 
for the very prolific and excellent work 
of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Madam Speaker, here we are dressed 
in white because it is Women’s History 
Month, and we are wearing the color of 
suffragists as we come to the floor on 
these two important pieces of legisla-
tion—earlier today, the equal rights 
amendment, and now the Violence 
Against Women Act. 
It is a historic day as the House 
passes two landmark, potentially life-
saving pieces of legislation on behalf of 
America’s women. We do so, again, dur-
ing Women’s History Month. I sing the 
praises 
of 
Congresswoman 
SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, who has been a relent-
less, persistent advocate for this legis-
lation over time; KAREN
BASS, one 
more, and our distinguished chair of 
the committee. 
Madam Speaker, we are particularly 
proud to be passing this legislation 
under the leadership of one of its 
strongest champions, President Joe 
Biden. In the Senate, he was the guard-
ian of this law, as he was the author of 
it. As a new-ish Member of Congress at 
the time, I was proud to follow his lead 
and the lead in the House, then, of 
Leader SCHUMER, now the distinguished 
majority leader in the Senate. So this 
is an opportunity that we have for leg-
islation, whose provenance goes way 
back into the 1990s. 
At that time, I was an appropriator. 
And after we passed the bill that had 
the Violence Against Women Act, it 
was our responsibility to make sure 
that it was funded properly, and that 
has been part of the continuing advo-
cacy. 
Madam Speaker, in 2013, the legisla-
tion was last reauthorized under the 
Presidency of Barack Obama and the 
Vice Presidency of Joe Biden, who, 
again, was taking the lead for the reau-
thorization of the legislation. It was a 
tough time. The bill passed first in the 
United States Senate. Bipartisan in the 
United States Senate, the bill was 
passed. They sent it to the House. The 
House refused to take it up—Repub-
lican-controlled House refused to take 
it up. 
And then they had their own bill, 
which said: We are against violence 
against women, unless you happen to 
be a Native American or an LGBTQ 
woman or an immigrant woman. 
Well, these are the most vulnerable 
in terms of using violence against 
women. So what happened was we per-
suaded the then-Speaker, Mr. Boehner, 
to bring both bills to the floor. Of

March 17, 2021 
course, the Senate-passed bipartisan 
bill prevailed. We had a big ceremony, 
participated in by the Native American 
community, our law enforcement com-
munity, Vice President Joe Biden, and 
signed by the President. 
b 1215 
So here we are, unable to get it reau-
thorized 5 years later, in 2018 under the 
then-majority and President, and here 
we are today, finally able to bring bi-
partisan legislation to the floor. 
And as I mentioned, for nearly three 
decades, the Violence Against Women 
Act has been a transformative force for 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
American 
women. Since its passage, domestic vi-
olence rates have declined by nearly 
two-thirds in America. Millions of 
women have gained access to protec-
tions from violence and abuse, and mil-
lions of survivors, to essential services 
and justice. 
But we cannot be complacent: One in 
three 
women 
today 
face 
domestic 
abuse. Isn’t that a stunning figure? 
You wonder, how could it be? And part-
ner violence is on the rise during the 
coronavirus pandemic, as many women 
are forced to quarantine in homes that 
are not safe. 
Every time the Congress has reau-
thorized VAWA, we have strengthened 
its protections for women, based on ex-
tensive consultation with survivors, 
victim service providers, Indian coun-
try, law enforcement, and other ex-
perts. The authorization on the floor 
today continues that progress. 
And as has been said by Mr. DOGGETT, 
we have to recognize the danger of the, 
shall we say, provisions in the bill that 
protect women from gun violence spe-
cifically. 
Among its many life-saving provi-
sions, this reauthorization makes vital 
new investments in prevention, im-
proves services for victims of domestic 
violence, makes improvements in the 
criminal justice system’s response to 
gender-based 
violence 
and 
to 
the 
healthcare system’s response, prevents 
intimate partner homicide, and ex-
pands protections for victims and sur-
vivors, 
whether 
they 
are 
men 
or 
women. This is not just about women, 
it is the Violence Against Women Act, 
but it does protect anyone. 
Democrats are particularly proud 
that this reauthorization improves the 
essential protections that I referenced 
that were objected to on the Repub-
lican bill in 2013, including women im-
migrants, LGBTQ, and Native Amer-
ican women, and it specifically sup-
ports communities of color in a cul-
turally sensitive way. 
This reauthorization is bipartisan, 
happily, and it is supported by more 
than 200 organizations representing 
women, women’s groups, faith-based 
organizations, law enforcement, the 
public health and medical commu-
nities, civil rights groups; the list goes 
on. 
While it is unfortunate that we don’t 
know what will happen in the Senate, 
we are optimistic that the reauthoriza-
tion can be successful on the other side 
of the Capitol, and on the other side of 
the aisle. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bi-
partisan vote for this reauthorization, 
so that we can advance justice, safety, 
and dignity in America. 
Madam Speaker, the term VAWA has 
become synonymous with justice, Vio-
lence Against Women Act. I urge an 
‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 
Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act. 
VAWA 
established 
critical 
infra-
structure that responds to domestic vi-
olence, sexual assault, dating violence, 
and stalking. 
For far too long, this vital update 
collected dust in the Senate graveyard. 
Thankfully, with a Democratic Senate 
majority and President Biden, we fi-
nally have real partners to secure jus-
tice, safety, and dignity for American 
women, particularly those who are 
most vulnerable. 
The statistics remain deplorable: One 
in four American women are victims of 
domestic violence; one in six will be a 
sexual assault victim in their lifetime. 
The pandemic only exacerbated the 
need for services to comprehensively 
respond to these egregious crimes. 
Now is no time to retreat from the 
vital work of improving the Federal re-
sponse to gender-based violence. For 
Women’s History Month, let’s reaffirm 
our commitment to survivors every-
where, and make this world safer for 
all our mothers, sisters, and daughters. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this urgent 
legislation. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, the Violence Against Women 
Act, this is something that should pro-
tect women. 
Unfortunately, the Violence Against 
Women Act has expanded its protection 
beyond 
women 
and 
girls 
into 
transgender or biological males who 
are calling themselves women. 
You see, Democrats know this is a 
bad policy and agenda. In order to pass 
it, they have to hide behind real abused 
women. 
The Violence Against Women Act 
incentivizes fraud in housing by allow-
ing people who have been evicted from 
government-funded housing because of 
criminal activity to claim, after the 
fact, they are domestic violence vic-
tims in order to keep their housing. 
The Violence Against Women Act 
also allows prisoners to pick their gen-
der and be treated and assigned by 
their specific preference. This isn’t fair 
to women who are in prison. Biological 
men should not be allowed to decide 
they are a woman and decide to tell 
people that they are a woman so they 
can be put in a women’s prison. 
The Violence Against Women Act 
provides no exemptions for religious 
organizations when they hire employ-
ees. That destroys religious freedom. 
Democrats also refuse to support 
amendments to help women receive 
firearm safety training and self-defense 
courses to protect them against their 
abusers. 
Republicans have introduced amend-
ments having to do with gun rights. If 
you want to help protect women, make 
sure women are gun owners and know 
how to use a gun properly in order to 
protect themselves. That is the great-
est defense for women. 
Democrats 
want 
to 
use 
abused 
women to take away guns from every-
one. Unfortunately, gun rights groups 
know how to pay attention to Demo-
crat bills that affect Americans’ gun 
rights. 
Democrats want to completely dis-
mantle housing contracts and leases in 
order to justify their hypocritical ‘‘be-
lieve all survivors’’ agenda, except 
when it comes to Governor Cuomo. 
Democrats want to create a Violence 
Against Women czar at the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. Now that they have destroyed 
the family and housing law, they want 
to push a progressive gender ideology 
through housing policy. That doesn’t 
fit. 
Make no mistake, Democrats want to 
create an authoritarian woke state 
where neighbors, partners, citizens, 
and employers are afraid to do any-
thing in order to avoid the draconian 
policies imposed under the guise of pro-
tecting women. 
We already know of many high-pro-
file men who abuse women. Why don’t 
we look in the mirror and take a hard 
look at the real abusers? I think Gov-
ernor Cuomo would be a good one to 
pay attention to, rather than trying to 
criminalize every church in America 
for not following the advice of the 
transgender coalition of gender dys-
phoria. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I reiterate my oppo-
sition 
to 
H.R. 
1620, 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act. 
Democrats filled this legislation with 
politically charged, highly controver-
sial provisions that dramatically ex-
panded its scope, and erased the bipar-
tisanship that originally passed this 
bill. 
Many of those points were pointed 
out by the speakers on the Republican 
side, and unfortunately, it does noth-
ing to address the problem of domestic 
violence, it threatens religious freedom 
and undermines the legislation’s origi-
nal intent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1463 
March 17, 2021 
Resources should be targeted to help 
women affected by the horrors of do-
mestic abuse and help prevent further 
abuse. This bill does neither. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, every 
year approximately 7.9 million women 
are victims of rape, physical violence, 
or stalking by an intimate partner. An 
average of three women are killed 
every day by a current or former inti-
mate partner. These grim statistics un-
derscore the crucial need for us to act 
without delay to reauthorize VAWA, 
and to enhance and expand the Act so 
that it is even more effective. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join with me in voting for 
this 
critical 
bipartisan 
legislation 
today, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
today I will vote to approve the Violence 
Against Women Extension Act (VAWA) of 
2021—historic landmark legislation with a 
proven track record of assisting abused and 
battered 
women—authored 
by 
Congress-
woman ELISE STEFANIK of New York. 
As a matter of fact, I was the prime author 
of the law that provided for the first reauthor-
ization of the VAWA in 2000—a five-year $3.3 
billion comprehensive program that was part 
of my anti-trafficking law, the Victims of Traf-
ficking and Violence Prevention Act (PL 106– 
386/TVPA). 
Important VAWA programs include: legal as-
sistance for victims; addressing housing needs 
for victims of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, sexual assault and stalking; grants to 
combat violent crimes on campuses; grants to 
encourage arrest policies and enforcement of 
protection orders; grants for enhanced training 
and services to end abuse later in life; the crit-
ical STOP grants to educate and train law en-
forcement personnel to address sexual as-
sault; the CHOOSE grants, i.e. Creating Hope 
Through Outreach, Options, Service, and Edu-
cation for Children and Youth; training and 
services to end violence against people with 
disabilities; the sexual assault services pro-
gram; rural domestic violence, dating violence, 
sexual assault, stalking and child abuse en-
forcement assistance; and grants for strength-
ening the healthcare system’s response to do-
mestic violence, dating violence, sexual as-
sault, and stalking; as well as extending other 
key programs. 
This is consistent with my long record of 
support for VAWA. 
I strongly supported passage of VAWA 
when it was first introduced in 1993, and again 
in 1994, when this crucial legislation was 
signed into law for the first time. I have sup-
ported multiple reauthorizations of VAWA, and 
I continue to strongly support this law as it 
was originally intended. 
As I said earlier, I was the prime author of 
the law that provided for the first reauthoriza-
tion of the VAWA in 2000 when I included the 
five-year $3.3 billion comprehensive program 
in my Victims of Trafficking and Violence Pre-
vention Act (PL 106–386/TVPA). 
I also cosponsored the 2005 reauthorization, 
fought to ensure these programs are fully 
funded to assist the maximum number of vic-
tims, and voted for seven of the first seven 
VAWA reauthorization bills offered through 
2012. 
Two versions of VAWA reauthorization are 
under consideration by the House today. As I 
noted, the version I will support extends the 
VAWA until 2022. The other—H.R. 1620— 
weakens several carefully crafted protections 
for women and girls. 
By granting biological men—who self-iden-
tify as women—access to women’s shelters, 
H.R. 1620 removes the hard-fought gains to 
protect women and girls from abuse and to 
provide them with physical, emotional and 
psychological security. 
Under H.R. 1620, women will no longer 
have a safe place of their own as they flee 
from male-inflicted physical and emotional 
abuse and intimidation. 
Rather, these heroic women will now have 
to share their place of refuge—a shelter pre-
viously reserved for women seeking protection 
from male abusers—with biological men who 
self-identify as women. 
These brave women and children deserve a 
place where they can feel protected and se-
cure, so they can begin the difficult process of 
healing as they deal with post-traumatic 
stress. Forcing them to share a shelter and its 
facilities, including showers and sleeping 
areas, with biological men who self-identify as 
women will cause these women and children 
to experience insecurity, discomfort, confusion, 
and fear of additional assault. 
VAWA has always prioritized the challenges 
and unique needs of battered women and chil-
dren but this version, if passed, no longer will. 
These women’s shelters—there are about 
1,500 nationwide—offer a safe space where a 
woman does not have to fear or worry about 
violence and intimidation and instead allows 
her to take steps toward rebuilding her life. 
We must first and foremost protect victims 
of violence. 
I oppose this provision of H.R. 1620 out of 
genuine concern for the women and children 
who are forced to flee to domestic abuse shel-
ters and base my concern on evidence from 
California. 
In late 2018, nine female victims residing in 
a women’s shelter in Fresno, California—Nao-
mi’s House, operated by Poverello House— 
filed a lawsuit against the shelter for admitting 
a biological man because he had self-identi-
fied as a woman. These victims stated that 
they had been sexually harassed by this bio-
logical man. They said that he had made 
‘‘sexual advances’’ on them and would ‘‘stare 
and leer’’ and make ‘‘sexually harassing com-
ments about their bodies’’ while they were 
forced to undress in the same room with him. 
After repeatedly confronting the staff of Nao-
mi’s House—both verbally and in writing—with 
their extreme discomfort, these women were 
told that they would be expelled from the shel-
ter if they refused to comply. 
If we allow biological men who self-identify 
as women to receive access to these women- 
only shelters, abused women and children will 
lose the ‘safe space’ they so desperately 
need. 
These victims deserve better. They deserve 
our protection and support. We must work to 
ensure the safety of women, girls, and chil-
dren. 
Other shelters designed to help victims of 
diverse sexual orientations and identities who 
are victims of domestic abuse ought to be 
considered by separate legislation. 
We can, and we must create bipartisan leg-
islation which seeks to protect all women and 
girls, as this law originally intended. 
We can, and must, do better. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in support of the Violence Against 
Women Reauthorization Act. 
The Violence Against Women Act is a dec-
ades-old law that helps protect some of my 
most vulnerable constituents from abuse. Un-
fortunately, the law has been expired since 
2018. 
At a time when the pandemic has forced 
many women in unsafe domestic situations to 
stay home, we owe them action. And I came 
to Congress to get results. 
Today, I’ll be proud to vote to advance 
strong and bipartisan legislation to reauthorize 
and update the Violence Against Women Act. 
The bill is going to extend the protections 
the law has in place while improving violence 
prevention and victim services. It will ensure 
communities of color are well served by the 
law. 
And what’s more, the bill is forward-looking. 
It designs studies to assess the challenges 
survivors face with things like achieving eco-
nomic security and paying off their student 
loans. Today, I’m offering an amendment to 
make sure these studies consider how these 
matters can have disparate impacts by race, 
ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, and gender 
identity. 
I urge my colleagues to support my amend-
ment and the bill before us today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HOULAHAN). All time for debate has ex-
pired.

lence in education. Such plan shall include— 
(1) an assessment to identify current gaps 
or challenges carrying out such investiga-
tion and enforcement, which may include

ment; 
(2) an examination of issues of recruiting, 
retention, and the professional development

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 233, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER) 
and the gentlewoman from Minnesota 
(Mrs. FISCHBACH) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. CRIST). 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment, 
based on the bipartisan Documents for 
Continued Safety Act that I introduced 
with Resident Commissioner Gonzalez- 
Colon of Puerto Rico. 
This amendment would allow STOP 
grants from the Department of Justice 
to be used to replace vital documents 
for survivors of domestic violence, free 
of cost. Some survivors grab all they 
can when they flee, leaving vital docu-
ments behind. Other didn’t have access 
to their vital docs. 
Rebuilding can be tough, but our 
amendment will help survivors turn 
the page and write a new chapter, on 
their terms, safe and free. 
b 1230 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
do have one of the en bloc amendments 
at the desk. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment re-
quires the Department of Justice and 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services to issue guidance on the issues 
identified by a Government Account-
ability Office report and the use of 
telehealth. 
In 2018, the Energy and Commerce 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee held an eye-opening hearing 
on sexual assault forensic examina-
tions that highlighted gaps in training 
and care related to sexual assault fo-
rensic examinations. The Government 
Accountability Office testified at this 
hearing on its 2016 report on sexual as-
sault forensic exams, which identified 
gaps in aspects of performing exams, 
training, leadership development, ex-
aminer program sustainability, and 
education of community stakeholders. 
This amendment is simple, and it is 
common sense. The Department of Jus-
tice and the Department of Health and 
Human Services must issue guidance 
on addressing the gaps identified by 
GAO. 
In Texas, there have been efforts to 
utilize 
telehealth, 
including 
the 
Project ECHO model, to provide sexual 
assault 
forensic 
examinations 
and 
training. The nurses involved in these 
programs have established their suc-
cess. I am sure States have employed 
other useful telehealth models that 
should be further explored as well. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate that 
this amendment is endorsed by the 
International Association of Forensic 
Nurses, signaling its importance, and I 
urge support for this amendment. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PHIL-
LIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amendment 
and the underlying bill. 
No one—and I mean no one—should 
be forced to stay in an abusive rela-
tionship because they fear deportation. 
Under current law, if a woman travels 
to the United States of America with 
someone on a temporary visa and that 
relationship turns abusive, they are 
trapped. 
My 
amendment 
to 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act 
would create a pilot program for vic-
tims of domestic abuse to apply for 
independent immigration status. It is 
that simple, and it is that important. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, in New Mexico, one in three 
women have experienced domestic vio-
lence. We must act swiftly to reauthor-
ize the Violence Against Women Act. 
The protections in this bill are a mat-
ter of life and death. 
My State has one of the highest sui-
cide rates. My amendment will help 
prevent suicide among survivors of sex-
ual assault.

It also recognizes that our diverse 
communities must receive culturally 
relevant legal aid and outreach pro-
grams. 
Let’s work to end gender-based vio-
lence in all of our communities. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished chairman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this has been a long 
journey, and I think it is important to 
take note of the many women who 
have helped us and to do this in the 
name of so many women who have lost 
their lives. 
I take this moment on the floor to 
support the en bloc amendment but, as 
well, to encourage my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle of how som-
ber and serious a moment this is that 
we do not take lightly to the floor be-
cause so many of us in our own con-
gressional 
districts 
have 
seen 
the 
scourge of domestic violence. 
We have seen the rise in domestic vi-
olence in a meteoric manner under 
COVID–19. It is rabid and rampant in 
all our cities. Our law enforcement of-
ficers have told us it is the most dan-
gerous call that they can possibly 
make. 
I am particularly concerned about 
sex trafficking victims, and I am very 
glad the manager’s amendment has 
language in there that indicates that 
sex trafficking victims experience sex-
ual violence and assault, and that the 
Federal recognition of their recovery is 
important. 
We look at all aspects of this impor-
tant issue in our country. The en bloc 
amendment represents Members’ con-
cerns for improving the treatment of 
women and men, the LGBTQ commu-
nity, Native Americans, and immigrant 
women who are culturally diverse. 
Madam Speaker, to the 200-plus orga-
nizations of the coalition, I want to say 
thank you to you for advocating with 
us. Writing this bill in 2018 and never 
giving up has been the challenge that I 
have taken up. 
I am very grateful to the many 
women who have joined me. Even 
though it was not passed when there 
was a Republican President, Repub-
lican Senate, and Republican House, 
and then it was blocked by the Repub-
lican Senate, we have now come with a 
fully robust and comprehensive bill 
that responds to the concerns of those 
who cannot help themselves. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman from Texas an 
additional 1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Housing and 
other aspects of the provisions that are 
in this bill pointedly speak to needs 
that have been brought to our atten-
tion by victims. This bill deals with 
victims, Madam Speaker, so when you 
are fleeing your home because your 
name is not on the lease or the mort-
gage, we now have provided an expe-
dited process for you to get housing 
with your children. 
We intervene and have cultural sensi-
tivity training for men and boys. We 
have a cultural sensitivity office inside 
the office of domestic violence so that 
women of different cultural back-
grounds can be responded to, along 
with focusing on culturally sensitive 
advocacy groups to help those women. 
Yes, we do prevent a convicted per-
son who has perpetrated a stalking or 
sexual assault from getting a gun, but 
this bill is controlled by due process in 
the Constitution. 
Let’s pass this bill. Women are wait-
ing. They can’t wait any longer. Men 
are waiting. Many communities are 
waiting. We can’t wait any longer, and 
we must pass this bill to be signed by 
the President of the United States. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
ask how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 51⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 39 
amendments packed into one little 
grouping called en bloc. 
The reason why I am opposed is that 
while some of these amendments are 
noble and worthwhile proposals on 
their own, they do not outweigh the 
underlying problems of the legislation 
or some of the truly bad amendments 
in this bloc. 
These amendments include provi-
sions that would further inject identity 
politics into the Violence Against 
Women Act, which we have heard over 
and over in this debate. There are stud-
ies about disparate impacts and meas-
ures that unnecessarily differentiate 
how we treat different groups of people. 
This entire bloc of 39 amendments in-
cludes amendments that further en-
croach on the affairs of State and local 
governments by creating new grants 
and pilot programs and spending more 
of 
the 
American 
taxpayers’ 
hard- 
earned dollars. 
One amendment in this bloc is de-
signed to incentivize States to legalize 
prostitution engaged in by minors to 
help sex trafficking victims. How does 
this make any sense? It doesn’t. 
Of course, we all want to stop sex 
trafficking, but this proposal has not 
been thought through and could have 
disastrous unintended consequences. I 
am 
going 
to 
say 
disastrous 
con-
sequences. 
We need to return the Violence 
Against Women Act to its original in-
tent that Congress passed in an over-
whelmingly bipartisan manner almost 
30 years ago. 
H.R. 1620 will expand and alter the 
fundamental nature of the Violence 
Against Women Act by imposing the 
trans agenda of putting biological men 
in women’s shelters and prisons. It 
does more to advance the Democrats’ 
progressive agenda than it does to pro-
tect women who need protection. 
Also concerning is the fact that this 
legislation did not undergo committee 
consideration. One would ask: Why 
not? 
There has been no committee hearing 
for this bill or these en bloc amend-
ments. Why not? 
There has been no committee mark-
up for this in Congress. Why not? 
Rather than rushing to pass this bill, 
we should have taken the time to truly 
examine the issues and determine 
what, if any, additional resources, re-
views, or studies are necessary. 
We all stand in opposition to any vio-
lence against women. Unfortunately, 
the government lockdowns during the 
COVID–19 pandemic resulted in an in-
creased amount of domestic violence, 
increased depression, increased suicide, 
and increased suffering. We have an ur-
gent need to address violence against 
women—and we should at all times— 
but not like this, by changing this so 
radically and including biological men. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose these amendments 
and the underlying bill, H.R. 1620. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman NADLER for his tire-
less work and the work of so many 
women 
of 
this 
Caucus, 
including 
Speaker PELOSI, to bring this bill to 
fruition and to bring this bill to the 
floor. 
We know, and we all believe, that vi-
olence against women and the support 
necessary to impede that from hap-
pening is necessary and should be reau-
thorized. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
en 
bloc 
amendment. 
The 
Nadler 
amendment en bloc is the culmination 
of a yearslong effort to authorize ex-
plicit Federal legal action against the 
nonconsensual disclosure and public 
transmission of intimate visual im-
agery, following the lead of dozens of 
the States. 
Nobody, under any circumstances, 
should have private intimate imagery 
shared on the internet without their 
consent. The pain that is caused by 
perpetrators who knowingly share sex-
ually explicit or nude images of some-
one without their consent has ruined 
lives and, in many instances, the lives 
of their family as well. It is weaponized 
to humiliate, harass, intimidate, and 
even exploit people who are primarily 
women. 
I am proud to support this amend-
ment that will give prosecutors and 
victims important tools to bring per-
petrators to justice and further deter

offenders from committing such a ter-
rible and egregious violation of pri-
vacy. Please approve this amendment 
and let us pass this bill. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
urge opposition to this en bloc amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, the 
en bloc amendment includes a number 
of very important amendments that 
make significant improvements to the 
bill. I appreciate all the Members who 
contributed to this en bloc amendment 
from both sides of the aisle, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, my 
amendment would strengthen the Sexual As-
sault Survivors’ Bill of Rights by providing sur-
vivors the right to be informed of the status 
and location of their sexual assault evidence 
collection kit. 
The Survivors’ Bill of Rights was enacted in 
2016 and provides fundamental protections to 
survivors, including: the right to receive a free 
medical forensic examination; the right to have 
a sexual assault kit preserved and to be in-
formed of any results related to the examina-
tion including a DNA profile match or toxi-
cology reports; the right to be informed of any 
disposal of a kit; and the right to prevent such 
disposal if desired. 
These are important protections that can be 
funded through Federal grants made available 
through the Victims of Crime Act. 
This amendment would add one additional 
and critical protection to that bill of rights. 
It would entitle survivors to know the status 
and location of their kits, providing greater 
transparency to how kits are handled and 
tracked by hospitals, forensic professionals, 
and law enforcement. 
My home state of Virginia launched just 
such a tracking program in 2019. 
In Virginia, each kit has a unique bar code 
and each survivor is provided with a PIN that 
allows them to track the status of their kit on-
line. 
Privacy concerns are allayed by the fact that 
no personally identifying information is in-
cluded in the tracking system, and it is entirely 
up to the survivor whether or not they want to 
report their assault to law enforcement. 
This is a transformative transparency regime 
for a process that has far too long been kept 
in the shadows, which has given rise to back-
logs and anxiety among survivors about the 
status of their kits and whether they are being 
used to hold their attackers accountable. 
The amendment is about empowering sur-
vivors, and I urge its adoption. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 233, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 233, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
STEFANIK) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, more than one in 
three women in this country have expe-
rienced some form of physical violence 
by their partner; and each year, mil-
lions of our mothers, sisters, daugh-
ters, and friends are victims of domes-
tic violence and sexual abuse. 
Tragically, new evidence shows that 
lockdowns, social isolation, and eco-
nomic insecurity caused by the COVID– 
19 pandemic has led to a hidden surge 
in domestic violence and abuse. So 
now, more than ever, we must come to-
gether to combat this crisis. 
In fact, Congress has a history of 
doing so on a bipartisan basis. The en-
actment 
of 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act in 1994 and the reauthoriza-
tions that followed were noncontrover-
sial and overwhelmingly bipartisan. 
Congress worked together to establish 
a coordinated community response to 
support victims and equip the justice 
system with the necessary resources to 
address these heinous crimes. 
Yet, in 2019, House Democrats al-
lowed VAWA’s authorization to lapse 
when they shunned the bipartisan his-
tory of VAWA and advanced a bill 
filled with controversial provisions, re-
jecting Republican offers to work in 
good faith and prioritize the well-being 
of women and children. 
At the time, I led the Violence 
Against Women’s Extension Act of 2019 
to extend the law and provide certainty 
to victims, survivors, families, and cri-
sis centers, but House Democrats put 
scoring political points ahead of the in-
terests of vulnerable women and re-
fused our efforts to prevent VAWA’s 
programs from going unauthorized. 
This year, here we are again. Demo-
crats are rushing their controversial 
bill back to the floor, bypassing com-
mittee consideration, and ignoring op-
portunities to work with Republicans 
to address the problematic provisions. 
They have denied new Members the op-
portunity to contribute to the bill, in-
cluding a record number of new Repub-
lican women, Representatives whose 
own lives and districts have been deep-
ly affected by these issues. 
So, once again, this House, rather 
than pursuing bipartisanship, is again 
considering 
a 
bill 
that 
promotes 
unproven methods of supporting vic-
tims, infringes upon Second Amend-
ment rights without adequate due 
process, and imposes new barriers to 
prosecuting domestic violence cases. 
My amendment is simple. It provides 
a clean extension of the Violence Again 
Women Act programs for the upcoming 
fiscal year without the controversial 
provisions added by Speaker PELOSI. 
Most importantly, it will ensure fund-
ing for critical programs that fight do-
mestic violence and sexual abuse for 
the American people. A clean extension 
provides us the opportunity to work to-
gether to pass a truly bipartisan, long- 
term reauthorization of the Violence 
Against Women Act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
The 
gentlewoman 
is 
right, 
her 
amendment is simple. It does nothing. 
It provides no increased funding. It 
does not provide for women who are 
desperate—and men and our indigenous 
community—at all. 
Among other things, this amendment 
would merely extend for 1 year, which 
is disastrous, rather than reauthorize 
for 5 years, essentially gutting the 
bill’s most critical grant programs. 
Some of the programs left out of this 
so-called extension are as follows: 
Outreach in services to underserved 
populations; 
The rape prevention and education 
grant, $110 million, a 50 percent in-
crease from the existing bill; 
Transitional 
housing 
assistance 
grants for VAWA victims. Women flee-
ing, men fleeing, victims fleeing, chil-
dren fleeing without having housing, 
we expedite that; 
Authorizing funding for the Tribal 
Access Program and; 
Child abuse training programs for ju-
dicial personnel and practitioners. 
By leaving these programs out, this 
amendment fails to recognize the range 
of needs that victims of domestic vio-
lence, sexual assault, dating violence, 
and stalking violence face. It simply 
fails the most desperate and needy peo-
ple. 
This amendment also omits all of the 
improvements to VAWA that are con-
tained in the underlying bill, H.R. 1620, 
which is a product of years of consulta-
tion with a range of stakeholders, and 
the failed efforts of Republicans year 
after year not to reauthorize. This is 
built on hard work, many of whom 
worked directly in the field with sur-
vivors and have a deep knowledge of 
VAWA’s programs. 
Relying in part on their expertise, 
this legislation contains dozens of im-
portant improvements to the range of 
programs contained in VAWA to make 
it an even more effective tool in ad-
dressing domestic violence. 
But this amendment dismisses the 
needs of the victims and survivors 
whose voices were our guide in devel-
oping H.R. 1620. It is shameful. 
For example, the underlying legisla-
tion enhances and expands victims’ 
services. It improves the criminal jus-
tice response to gender-based violence, 
and it expands legal assistance. It 
makes additional investments in pre-
vention. It improves access to housing 
for victims and survivors. 
It ends impunity for non-Native per-
petrators of sexual assault, which has 
gone on for years. Go to the reserva-
tion of Pueblo, assault a Native Amer-
ican woman, and have no account-
ability. 
It supports communities of color and 
LGBTQ individuals. It protects victims 
of dating violence and firearm homi-
cide. It improves the healthcare sys-
tem’s response to domestic violence, 
sexual assault, dating violence, and 
stalking. 
But the Stefanik amendment would 
eliminate all of these vital programs. 
In essence, it would leave women and 
victims helpless and without hope. 
Do not be fooled. This amendment 
does 
not 
demonstrate 
support 
for 
VAWA. It demonstrates a lack of com-
mitment to ensuring that the programs 
contained within VAWA can best serve 
and protect the survivors and victims 
who rely on them. 
Since VAWA’s enactment in 1994, 
Congress has repeatedly enhanced the 
prior versions of the law, including in 
reauthorizations in 2000, 2005, and 2013. 
Since the last reauthorization, there 
has been an uptick in demand for the 
essential services under VAWA due to 
the Me Too movement and women com-
ing forward out of the shadows. 
There has also been an uptick in vic-
tims’ and survivors’ and children’s 
needs for services due to the financial 
strain imposed by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. That is why H.R. 1620 both reau-
thorizes and improves the law. This 
amendment would effectively do nei-
ther. 
Victims and survivors deserve better 
than this half measure, and they would 
look to the women of this Congress to 
be sensitive to their plight. 
Domestic violence providers and sur-
vivors all have spoken loud and clear 
with hundreds of organizations sup-
porting and endorsing H.R. 1620. They 
have asked for the underlying bill, not 
a bait-and-switch that is fatally flawed 
and makes no meaningful improve-
ments to the bill or to the law. 
Finally, this amendment will not 
help the legislation move in the Sen-
ate. We have spoken with the leaders in 
the Senate on both sides of the aisle on 
this issue and they agree that we must

improve the Violence Against Women 
Act. It is greatly needed in order to 
stop the scourge of domestic violence, 
which is surging in our Nation, and not 
freeze it, as the Stefanik amendment 
would do. 
Therefore, I urge opposition to this 
amendment, which would undermine 
H.R. 1620 and years of work, years of 
building on this with so many collabo-
rators. I thank our chairman, the many 
women who helped me with writing 
this legislation, and those who offered 
substantial amendments to improve it, 
even those in the last Congress. 
We don’t want to freeze that behavior 
that will be positive. This amendment 
would seriously damage the Violence 
Against Women Act. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition 
to this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, among other things, this 
amendment would merely extend for one year, 
rather than reauthorize for five years, some of 
the programs under the Violence Against 
Women Act, essentially gutting the bill’s most 
critical grant programs. Some of the programs 
left out of this so-called extension are: 
Outreach and services to underserved pop-
ulations; 
The rape prevention and education grant; 
Transitional housing assistance grants for 
VAWA victims; Authorizing funding for the 
Tribal Access Program; and 
Child abuse training programs for judicial 
personnel and practitioners. 
By leaving these programs out, this amend-
ment fails to recognize the range of needs that 
victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, 
dating violence, and stalking face. 
This amendment also omits all of the im-
provements to VAWA that are contained in the 
underlying bill. H.R. 1620 is the product of 
years of consultation with a range of stake-
holders, many of whom work directly in the 
field with survivors and have a deep knowl-
edge of VAWA’s programs. 
Relying in part on their expertise, this legis-
lation contains dozens of important improve-
ments to the range of programs contained in 
VAWA to make it an even more effective tool 
in addressing domestic violence. But this 
amendment dismisses the needs of the vic-
tims and survivors whose voices were our 
guide in developing H.R. 1620. 
For example, the underlying legislation en-
hances and expands victims’ services; it im-
proves the criminal justice response to gen-
der-based violence and expands legal assist-
ance; it makes additional investments in pre-
vention; it improves access to housing for vic-
tims and survivors; and it ends impunity for 
non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault. 
It supports communities of color and 
LGBTQ individuals; it protects victims of dating 
violence from firearm homicide; and it im-
proves the healthcare system’s response to 
domestic violence, sexual assault, dating vio-
lence, and stalking. 
But the Stefanik Amendment would elimi-
nate all of these vital provisions. Do not be 
fooled—this amendment does not demonstrate 
support for VAWA, it demonstrates a lack of 
commitment to ensuring that the programs 
contained within VAWA can best serve and 
protect the survivors and victims who rely on 
them. 
Since VAWA’s enactment in 1994, Con-

That is why H.R. 1620 both reauthorizes

effectively do neither. Victims and survivors

would do. 
Therefore, I urge opposition to this amend-
ment, which would undermine H.R. 1620 and 
would seriously damage the Violence Against 
Women Act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, 
make no mistake, VAWA’s authoriza-
tion lapse last year is due to House 
Democrats’ choice to ram through 
their partisan version of this bill rath-
er than work on a bipartisan basis. 
When my colleague across the aisle 
talks about conversations with the 
Senate, we know last year that there 
were no effective bipartisan conversa-
tions with the Senate, which is why 
they didn’t take up the Democrats’ 
partisan version. 
My amendment is a clean extension 
of VAWA. It ensures that there is cer-
tainty and funding for these programs. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ for 
this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 40 OFFERED BY MRS. WAGNER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 40 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
12. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to offer my amendment No. 40 to 
H.R. 1620, the Violence Against Women 
Reauthorization Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 17, line 18, strike ‘‘and’’. 
Page 17, strike line 19 through line 2 of 
page 18 and insert the following: 
(ii) in paragraph (C)(i) by striking ‘‘$20,000 
in Department funds, unless the Deputy At-
torney General’’ and inserting ‘‘$100,000 in 
Department funds, unless the Director or 
Principal Deputy Director of the Office on 
Violence Against Women, the Deputy Attor-
ney General,’’; and 
(iii) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(E) INELIGIBILITY.—If the Attorney Gen-
eral finds that a recipient of grant funds 
under this Act has fraudulently misused 
such grant funds, after reasonable notice and 
opportunity for a hearing, such recipient 
shall not be eligible to receive grant funds 
under this Act for up to 5 years. A misuse of 
grant funds or an error that does not rise to 
the level of fraud is not grounds for ineligi-
bility.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 233, the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Missouri. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I believe we have a 
sacred responsibility to protect and 
empower women, end abuse and as-
sault, and hold perpetrators of violence 
against women accountable for their 
crimes. 
However, we need to be sure that our 
efforts are effective. The Department 
of Justice inspector general has con-
sistently 
revealed 
fraudulent 
and 
wasteful uses of VAWA grant funds. 
Congress should demand accountability 
so that every dollar marked for helping 
victims 
and 
preventing 
violence 
against women actually goes to help 
the most vulnerable. 
My commonsense amendment would 
prevent those who commit fraud and 
misuse from receiving VAWA funds. 
Madam Speaker, they are stealing 
from the victims that they are sup-
posed to be helping by these efforts and 
should face the consequences. 
Democrats and Republicans should 
agree that this amendment will ad-
vance prevention efforts and victim 
services. I urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support my amend-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, however, I want to 
take this opportunity to touch on 
something that is even more impor-
tant. I am ashamed that Democrats 
would bring this legislation to the floor 
without my amendment that would 
allow sex trafficking victims to receive 
grant funding through the Creating 
Hope Through Outreach, Options, Serv-
ices, and Education for Children and 
Youth program. 
My 
amendment 
was 
removed,

sex trafficking funding for victims and 
children. 
Also not allowed, Madam Speaker, 
was my amendment that bans the hor-
rors of sex-selection abortions that 
have killed millions of girls around the 
world and right here in the United 
States. It is an unthinkable tragedy 
that little girls are targeted for death 
even before they are born solely be-
cause of their sex, and I am grieved 
that Democrats would not allow a vote 
on this basis to protect unborn girls. 
These two amendments are at the 
very core of what it means to protect 
women and girls, and I am outraged 
that Democrats have chosen to move 
forward in a partisan manner without 
these critical provisions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support my amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to this 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in reluctant opposition to this amend-
ment. 
While I believe it is well-intentioned, 
and we all want to prevent the misuse 
of Federal funds, I am concerned about 
the effect that it may have on small 
service providers that provide crucial 
services to victims and survivors. 
It is also unnecessary since the un-
derlying bill maintains existing ac-
countability 
measures, 
which 
have 
proven to work very well. 
This amendment imposes a manda-
tory bar on receiving grant funds up to 
5 years if the grant recipient is found 
to have fraudulently misused such 
grant funds. Smaller providers, many 
of whom are run on a voluntary basis, 
are more likely to make financial er-
rors because they lack the accounting, 
financial, and compliance expertise 
that larger organizations have. 
Many of these small providers are 
culturally specific, rural, and Tribal 
programs that play a crucial role in 
their 
communities. 
Banning 
such 
groups from receiving funding for 5 
years in these circumstances could 
have an unnecessarily punitive effect 
and could be detrimental to the vic-
tims and survivors who rely on them. 
For many small service providers 
who rely on Federal funds to support 
their operations, such a severe penalty, 
or even the threat of one, could make 
a difference between continuing to 
serve victims and survivors in need and 
shutting their doors forever. 
Accountability is vital in all forms, 
and I appreciate the spirit behind this 
amendment; but, for these providers, I 
fear it could end up doing more harm 
than good. It is because of these con-
cerns that this amendment is opposed 
by the National Network to End Do-
mestic Violence, among other organi-
zations, and I must reluctantly oppose 
the amendment as well. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, this amendment will im-
prove the underlying bill. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this amendment, and join me, along 
with the Department of Justice and the 
inspector general, to make sure that 
we are preventing fraud and abuse in 
these grant programs and making sure 
that every dollar marked for helping 
victims 
and 
preventing 
violence 
against women actually goes to help 
the most vulnerable. 
Nevertheless, Madam Speaker, the 
underlying bill neglects to give traf-
ficking victims and children the re-
sources they need and was purposefully 
stripped from this partisan piece of leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose H.R. 1620, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire as to the amount of time 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 31⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me acknowledge the leadership of 
the gentlewoman who has offered this 
amendment and the opportunities that 
we have had to work together. I look 
forward to working with her going for-
ward. 
I have also worked with, over the 
years—really starting from the time 
that I stood alongside of then-Senator 
Joe Biden as this bill was presented for 
reauthorization. It went all the way 
through my time on the Judiciary 
Committee and the writing of this bill 
in 2018, when, unfortunately, there was 
no effort by the Judiciary Committee 
to put this bill forward for a hearing, 
there was no effort by the Senate Re-
publicans, and no effort by the Repub-
lican President in 2018 to do anything 
about the scourge of violence against 
women and men and many groups. 
I have worked with the 200-plus orga-
nizations that are involved in the coa-
lition that stand against sexual assault 
and rape and stalking and domestic vi-
olence. They are in many different cat-
egories and sizes, but they are vital in 
their service. 
I am concerned that this amendment 
would undermine those smaller organi-
zations, who are unique in their service 
that they provide. They are in places 
where large organizations may not be. 
They are working with indigenous pop-
ulations, Native Americans, immigrant 
women, LGBTQ. They are saving lives. 
People of color, Hispanic, African 
American, we have a very sizeable por-
tion of them and in this legislation, we 
are reaching out to people who cannot 
respond and help themselves; housing 
provisions, in case you have to flee, ex-
pediting your ability to get housing. 
Then I am as concerned about sex 
trafficking as my good friend is. I have 
worked on this legislation. As a former 
member of the Houston Area Women’s 
Center, I am also well aware of the cri-
sis as it relates to the need for this bill. 
But in the manager’s amendment, we 
do have language that says that we 
should have a placeholder for sex traf-
ficking victims who experience sexual 
violence and assault; that the Federal 
recognition of their recovery is impor-
tant. 
Throughout this bill, there are provi-
sions that will help individuals who are 
sex-trafficked. We have that in the bill 
in relationship to the particular ac-
tions that are generated if you are sex-
ually assaulted while you are sex-traf-
ficked. 
So we know that this bill is sensitive. 
There is more that can be done. We 
look forward to a freestanding bill that 
deals in specifics, as we have done in 
the past. 
I held the first hearing in my con-
gressional district on human traf-
ficking. I have worked with advocates 
and continue to work with them, and 
so I take issue that this bill is not sen-
sitive to sex-trafficked individuals, and 
I look forward to working with the 
gentlewoman as we look forward to ex-
panded resources and expanded re-
sponse to those who have been sex-traf-
ficked and human-trafficked, because 
that scourge continues. 
This legislation responds to those 
like that woman in my district who 
lost her life in the days after Christmas 
and had her son shot at by her hus-
band. We pay tribute to her. I ask my 
colleagues to vote against this amend-
ment. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 233, the previous 
question is ordered on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. WAGNER). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration of H.R. 1620 is

CLERK 
TO 
MAKE 
CORRECTIONS 
IN 
EN-
GROSSMENT OF H.R. 1620, VIO-
LENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAU-
THORIZATION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that, in the en-
grossment of H.R. 1620, the Clerk be au-
thorized to correct section numbers, 
punctuation, spelling, and cross-ref-
erences, and to make such other tech-
nical and conforming changes as may 
be necessary to reflect the actions of 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

quest of the gentleman from New 
York? 
There was no objection.

ELECTING A CERTAIN MEMBER TO 
A 
CERTAIN

COM-

for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 244 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
ber be, and is hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committee of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE: Mr. Bishop of 
Georgia. 
Mr. JEFFRIES (during the reading). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be considered as 
read and printed in the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today during Women’s History Month 
to celebrate countless women across 
America making a difference. From 
coast to coast, in every community and 
every industry, women are getting it 
done. 
Take Kishia Powell, the current chief 
operations officer and EVP of DC 
Water. I had the great pleasure to meet 
Kishia last week while visiting the 
brand-new headquarters. She is work-
ing in an industry dominated by men, 
and Kishia has stayed dedicated to her 
role as a woman leader in the water 
utilities industry. She is literally turn-
ing sludge into a new energy utility for 
Washington, D.C., and the surrounding 
regions. 
Then there is Sister Pamela Marie 
Buganski, a native Toledoan who dedi-
cated her life to faith and community. 
I remember meeting her in Matamoros, 
Mexico, as she was witnessing what 
was happening to immigrant children 
and families as a result of President 
Trump’s Remain in Mexico order. Pam-
ela gave everything she had to others 
before she, sadly, passed away last 
year. 
Women like former Member Jill Long 
Thompson from Indiana have played an 
instrumental role in advancing change 
and conversation across America. As a 
Member and as a teacher, she recently 
wrote a book about government ethics 
and how President Trump’s Presidency 
undermined the ethics of our democ-
racy. 
Finally, there are women like Patsy 
Pasquale, who humbly carries on her 
father’s Toledo shoe business and leg-
acy in orthopedic footwear after his 
death from COVID–19 last December. 
This Women’s History Month, we 
strive to celebrate all that women do 
in this country and the lasting impact 
they create. Let us be thankful for 
their beautiful lives that elevate the 
worth of our families, communities, 
culture, and economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I proudly stand with all 
my sisters this evening. 
f 
CONDEMNING WEST COAST 
VIOLENCE 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, over 
the past year, we have witnessed unac-
ceptable acts of violence across our 
country. We have watched lives and 
livelihoods being destroyed. 
Even now, after one of the most chal-
lenging years Americans have faced in 
recent history, the violence continues. 
In just the past few days, in both Port-
land and Seattle, rioters smashed the 
doors and windows of local small busi-
nesses, violently assaulted police offi-
cers, and firebombed the local court-
house. 
In January, I called on my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to take a 
stand against political violence. But 
rather than condemning these appall-
ing acts, politicians and the media con-
tinue to turn a blind eye. They ignore, 
downplay, and even defend these des-
picable and violent actions. It is inex-
cusable. 
When we see this violence, we must 
condemn it for what it is: domestic ter-
ror. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand firm against all 
acts of violence, and I continue to call 
on this body to do the same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1483 
March 17, 2021 
INVESTING IN PROGRAMS TO 
SUPPORT SURVIVORS 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 1620, the Vio-
lence Against Women Reauthorization 
Act. I am proud to cosponsor this bill, 
and I want to thank Congresswoman 
SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE
and Chairman 
JERRY NADLER for, once again, their 
leadership and bold efforts to bring this 
bill to the floor. 
This reauthorization bill builds upon 
the landmark 1994 legislation by ex-
panding protections and services for 
survivors, while also working to pre-
vent violence from occurring in the 
first place. It makes vital investments 
in 
preventing 
sexual 
assaults 
and 
stalking and increases victims’ access 
to safe housing and economic stability. 
It also increases funding of programs 
for culturally specific services. 
An estimated one in three women ex-
perience domestic violence in this 
country. I personally know what strong 
and 
consistent 
support 
means 
to 
emerge as a survivor. 
When I was in the California State 
Legislature, I authored the Violence 
Against Women Act for the State of 
California. And today, I am so proud, 
along with Congresswoman JACKSON 
LEE, that we passed the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act 
with bipartisan support. When I was in 
the California State Legislature, a Re-
publican Governor signed my bill into 
law, so I thank the gentlewoman very 
much for her leadership. 
f 
COOPERATE WITH CENTRAL 
AMERICA’S NORTHERN TRIANGLE 
(Mr. FORTENBERRY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks). 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, a 
hallmark of America is that we have 
opened our arms and have been a just 
and generous nation to people who are 
fleeing political violence elsewhere, 
who have been persecuted in their na-
tive lands, and who are coming here to 
seek a better way of life. But here is 
the problem, Mr. Speaker: chaos and 
disorder at our border undermine the 
ability of our country to extend that 
generosity. 
A little-known fact about all of this 
is that for many years we have been 
working to get this question off of the 
one-yard line. But here we are again, 
seeing the trauma of unaccompanied 
children at our border and people re-
ceiving the wrong message that they 
can simply come here. 
We spent hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in the Northern Triangle countries 
of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Hon-
duras to try to rebuild the conditions 
for the rule of law, to stop crime, and 
to give people economic opportunity. 
That is the right policy, and we had co-
operative agreements with those coun-
tries to begin to halt the messaging 
that it is proper or appropriate to come 
here illegally. Of course, this feeds 
human trafficking and children being 
left alone. 
It is unjust. We need to return to the 
previous policy in which we are cooper-
ating with those countries. 
f 
CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate and commemorate 
this historic month, Women’s History 
Month, and to celebrate the passing in 
the House of the equal rights amend-
ment, as well as VAWA, the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act, 
H.R. 1620. 
How grateful I am that this bill, H.R. 
1620, addresses the need of sex traf-
ficking victims while creating a dem-
onstration 
program 
on 
trauma-in-
formed training for law enforcement. It 
increases access to grant programs for 
culturally specific organizations and 
ensures culturally specific organiza-
tions are included in the development 
of programs. 
It is supported by the National Task 
Force to End Sexual and Domestic Vio-
lence Against Women, a coalition of 
over 200 groups. 
VAWA expired on September 30, 2018. 
We, as a body, are called upon by sur-
vivors to do our job. I am delighted to 
celebrate ANN KUSTER, GWEN MOORE, 
JACKIE
SPEIER, 
BRENDA
LAWRENCE, 
LOIS
FRANKEL, DEBBIE
DINGELL, and 
KAREN
BASS, and the name of So-
journer Truth, the abolitionist suffra-
gist, and Ivalita Jackson, my mother, a 
modern-day abolitionist and suffragist. 
They know that to get the job done, we 
must get the job done. 
This bill is on to the other body, and 
now it is to be signed by the President 
of the United States. It is catapulted in 
Women’s History Month. We celebrate 
ERA and the Violence Against Women 
Act. 
f 
PROTECTING ALL AMERICANS 
FROM VIOLENCE AND ABUSE 
(Ms. STEVENS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this bipartisan bill to pro-
tect Americans from violence and 
abuse and to ensure that survivors of 
domestic abuse have access to the serv-
ices they need. 
I rise in support of a single mom hid-
ing in a shelter with her two children. 
I rise in support of a mother looking to 
flee an abusive marriage with her chil-
dren covered in disinfectant chemicals. 
These are the conversations I have had 
with women in my district, in Michi-
gan 11. 
The Violence Against Women Act re-
authorizes funding for a variety of crit-
ical grant programs, including for vic-
tim services, prevention, training, edu-
cation, enforcement, economic sta-
bility, and on. 
Two years ago, Mr. Speaker, I walked 
with my colleagues over to the Senate 
majority leader’s office to demand a 
vote on this reauthorization, and he re-
fused to see us. He refused to even 
allow a vote. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, as I rise, I look 
forward to working with a new Senate 
majority leader and a new President 
who will commit to protecting all 
Americans from violence in the house-
hold. 
f 
PROVIDING EQUAL PROTECTION 
FOR ALL 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, during 
my first month in Congress, I visited 
Family Shelter Service, an organiza-
tion that provides lifesaving coun-
seling, victim protection, and a 24/7 
hotline to women and children in 
northern Illinois. They provide nearly 
11,000 nights of shelter for abused 
women and children every year. 
To their staff, to their clients, and to 
the one in three women in the United 
States who experience domestic vio-
lence and the one in five women who 
are raped, the Violence Against Women 
Act has been a lifeline since 1994. But it 
needs to be updated and renewed, and 
that is what we have done today. 
The Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act of 2021 makes crucial 
updates to this landmark bill to ad-
dress its gaps, expand protections, and 
meet increased needs. We have ex-
panded protections to make the law 
more inclusive of our LGBT commu-
nities. We have closed loopholes to bet-
ter protect victims from gun violence, 
improved victim services to help sur-
vivors heal and access justice, and in-
creased funding for programs to help 
children who are exposed to domestic 
violence in the home. 
We have made vital new investments 
in prevention and victim services, in-
cluding an amendment that I intro-
duced to train healthcare providers on 
college campuses so they can better 
meet the needs of the one in four un-
dergraduate women who are victims of 
sexual assault. 
This is for our mothers, our sisters, 
our daughters, and our friends. But it 
is also for Americans, regardless of 
their gender, who aspire to live in a 
country that truly provides equal pro-
tection and equal opportunities for all. 
We have done our work here today. It 
is now crucial that the Senate do 
theirs and send this bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
material on the subject of my Special 
Order in the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, as a 
co-chair of the Democratic Women’s 
Caucus, I am pleased to lead this Spe-
cial Order in celebration of Women’s 
History Month. Throughout March, we 
recognize the women leaders, trail-
blazers, and pioneers who come before 
us. 
We have chartered a path forward 
that will lift up and empower young 
women and girls. The soul and moral 
compass of our Nation rests on the 
shoulders of women throughout this 
history. 
I am proud to fight every day so that 
we can improve the quality of life for 
women and girls in Michigan and 
across this country. 
As the co-chair of the Democratic 
Women’s Caucus and the vice chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, I have 
made it a mission to put women issues 
and Black women issues front and cen-
ter in this Congress. 
But before I go into the work that we 
have done and are doing in this Cham-
ber, I want to recognize the inspira-
tional women in my life who helped 
shape who I am. 
First, I want to acknowledge my 
grandmother, who, without a high 
school education, taught me the value 
of education, taught me the value of 
being a woman, of being a wife, of 
being a mother. She is my rock and my 
foundation. She taught me that being a 
woman and being a Black woman in 
America ‘‘is to be fearless, Brenda,’’ to 
never apologize, and be accountable for 
everything that I do, and that I work 
hard, get my education, and keep my 
faith in God. There was no door I could 
not walk through or no table that I did 
not deserve to sit at. She had strength 
and confidence in something I carry 
with me every single day. 
Then there is my shero, Shirley Chis-
holm, who paved the way for Black 
women like me to be in Congress. She 
proved every day the power that 
women had to change their commu-
nity. Shirley Chisholm always said: ‘‘If 
they don’t give you a seat at the table, 
bring a folding chair.’’ 
And, my goodness, the majority of 
women who represent us here in Con-
gress are carrying their own folding 
chair. 
So we have our first woman, our first 
Black American, our first Asian-Amer-
ican Vice President, who has coined 
the phrase: ‘‘The first, but not the 
last.’’ 
We stand on the shoulders, all of us, 
of giants. We continue to build the 
foundation so that the next generation 
of girls and young women can stand on 
our shoulders. Look at this Congress. 
There are over 140 Democrat and Re-
publican women in the House and the 
Senate, the most ever in the history of 
our country. 
That translates to the work we are 
doing in this Chamber to better the 
lives of women and girls. If you look at 
today, we voted to pass the equal 
rights amendment resolution and the 
Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act. These are the steps in the 
right direction. We have come a long 
way, baby, for full equality, but we 
still have work to do. 
We, unfortunately, have a system in 
America that often suppress women 
and does not support women. But we 
know that, ‘‘A woman is like a tea 
bag,’’ like Eleanor Roosevelt said, ‘‘you 
never know how strong she is until she 
gets in hot water.’’ 
And I know for a fact that women 
have continued to stand up against 
every barrier. You point to this pan-
demic and you see how women, espe-
cially women of color, have borne the 
brunt of this health and economic cri-
sis. But we keep moving and we will 
continue in this Congress to fight for 
the women in America. 
This is our responsibility, and I am 
glad that we have women leaders 
across the Federal, State, and local 
governments that we have looked up 
to. Every woman in this Congress 
today recognizes that the next genera-
tion is looking at us and asking us to 
stand up. 
Our Vice President of the United 
States, our Speaker of the House, and 
half of President Biden’s Cabinet, and 
even on the other side of the aisle, the 
chair of the House Republican Party, 
all are women. We are making success, 
and I know that we can do so much 
more. 
I continue to work, and I want to 
know that when women succeed, Amer-
ica succeeds, as our amazing Speaker 
of the House reminds us. 
I am so glad to share this hour with 
some of our amazing women leaders 
who will continue to tell us, while we 
have a month dedicated to women’s 
history, we make history every single 
day. 
I would like to ask for my first 
speaker to come to the podium. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding, my 
friend, my colleague, my co-chair of 
the Democratic Women’s Caucus. 
I rise tonight in honor of Women’s 
History Month and the heroic, trail-
blazing women of our military, who 
have risked their lives for our country 
in the advancement of women’s equity 
and equality. 
Women have been on the front lines 
fighting for America’s values and free-
dom since the founding of our Nation. 
Our foremothers blazed a trail for 
women like Loretta Walsh, who, in 
1917, as America teetered on the brink 
of entering World War I, heard and an-
swered the call to serve. Loretta be-
came the first woman to enlist in the 
U.S. military in a position other than 
nursing and was our first female chief 
petty officer. 
I also want to recognize Captain 
Kristen Griest and Lieutenant Shaye 
Haver, the first women to graduate 
from the Army Ranger School; Mar-
cella Hayes, America’s first Black fe-
male fighter pilot; and Mary Edward 
Walker, the first female U.S. Army sur-
geon who served in the Civil War and 
the only woman to receive the Presi-
dential Medal of Honor. 
The strength and courage of these 
women and so many more like them re-
inforces what we already know: There 
is nothing women cannot do. 
When women are in positions of lead-
ership, our country is in better hands. 
I believe that this is especially true in 
our military. 
I honor General Ann E. Dunwoody, 
our Nation’s first female four-star gen-
eral; Admiral Michelle Howard, the 
Navy’s first female four-star admiral 
and first African American to com-
mand a U.S. naval ship; and Air Force 
General Laura Richardson, the first fe-
male commander of a combatant com-
mand. 
These women have served our Nation 
honorably. They now must open new 
doors for a generation of women to ful-
fill their dreams to serve our country 
under safe conditions, free from sexual 
assault and harassment. 
All of these women warriors volun-
teered for duty and risked their lives 
while fighting rampant misogyny, in-
cluding attacks from talking heads on 
national TV—who have never served 
our 
country—and 
racism 
for 
the 
women of color. Their unflinching 
courage has paved the way for thou-
sands of women serving in our Armed 
Forces today. Our military is stronger 
and this country is safer because 
women serve. 
We honor these military women’s 
achievements today on the House floor. 
May we never forget their sacrifice, 
duty, and dedication. May they elevate 
a new generation of women in the mili-
tary, free from bias, racial discrimina-
tion, and sexual assault. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my amazing co-chair for every-
thing she does. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
I rise today to honor our foremothers 
who first demanded equity in and out-
side the home, along with the sheroes

March 17, 2021 
of today who still battle for it amidst 
this deadly pandemic both on and be-
hind its front lines. 
The onset of COVID–19 pushed so 
many brave women into the deadly 
viral fires. It also foisted upon too 
many of them an inordinate share of 
unpaid caretaker and teacher roles 
once they were safe at home. 
Throughout all of history, it is 
women, especially those of color, who 
bear the harshest health and economic 
burdens and fallout from such national 
crises. 
The data is clear: Only a full recov-
ery that prioritizes women can reverse 
this ‘‘she-cession’’ we are in. 
That is why I proudly supported the 
American Rescue Plan, which provides 
much-needed help to women across this 
country. This relief package includes 
historic expansion of the child tax 
credit to help lift children and families 
out of poverty, and provides paid-leave 
tax credits to help more women stay in 
the workforce. 
It also makes the investments needed 
to safely reopen schools and keep the 
childcare industry afloat so women and 
families can pay for care and get back 
to work. 
And with the inclusion of $1,400 stim-
ulus checks per family member and ex-
tended 
unemployment 
assistance, 
women can finally regain their footing 
as equal partners and breadwinners. 
Yet, even among these many chal-
lenges women have faced over this last 
year, we cannot overlook that, for the 
first time in history, we have sworn in 
a Madam Vice President. The historic 
inauguration of Vice President Harris 
will inspire countless girls to higher 
ambitions, and it marks a milestone 
for all women of color whose work, 
leadership, and vision went unrecog-
nized for far too long. 
In the Jewish faith, one of our most 
important tenets is the concept of l’dor 
v’dor—from generation to generation. 
It is our responsibility to lift up the 
women of tomorrow and ensure that 
the world provides every opportunity 
for them to succeed. 
This Women’s History Month, while 
we honor and remember the women 
who have carried us through this and 
other past national calamities, we also 
celebrate that the shoulders we now 
stand on provide an even clearer vision 
of the equity and fairness for which we 
all strive. 
Women are the changemakers, the vi-
sionaries, and the leaders of the future. 
Today, we celebrate a world in which 
my two daughters and all young girls 
everywhere have bold, limitless visions 
and dreams that are now truly pos-
sible. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her leadership. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. LOIS FRANKEL), my co-chair. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding, my sister in good trouble. 
This is Women’s History Month, a 
time to reflect the gains women have 
made; the struggles we continue to 
face; and the strong, fearless, and self-
less women who have and continue to 
pave the way. 
I have often lamented, as have many 
of my colleagues here, that for women 
to reach their full potential, we must 
be in charge of our own reproductive 
destiny. No one should have to call 
their Governor or Member of Congress 
for permission to access contraception 
or abortion. And even after the land-
mark decision Roe v. Wade, it is a con-
stant battle to protect a hard-fought 
right to legal abortion. 
We have seen Republican administra-
tions and Republican States legisla-
tures create obstacle after obstacle to 
prevent women from achieving repro-
ductive freedom, blocking access to 
legal abortion and even contraception. 
We have seen private citizens, under 
the guise of protecting lives, threaten 
abortion providers, including assassi-
nating physicians that provide abor-
tions. 
And then there are the angels on the 
ground who, day in and day out, pro-
tect our precious right to reproductive 
freedom. 
With this background, I want to 
highlight a courageous woman in my 
hometown of West Palm Beach, Flor-
ida, who has made and continues to 
make history as a great champion of 
women’s reproductive rights. She is 
one of the bravest people I know, some-
one I am proud to call a friend. Her 
name is Mona Reis. 
Mona’s mission began early on in 
life, as a teenager. Six years before Roe 
v. Wade, she participated in a Florida’s 
Girls State program that gives teen 
girls an opportunity to run the Florida 
State Legislature, and she actually in-
troduced a bill to legalize abortion in 
the State. Of course, it didn’t pass. 
But this was just the beginning of a 
lifelong career and a commitment to 
protecting a woman’s right to choose, 
from working at the first outpatient 
abortion clinic established in Florida 
in the 1970s to, now, building her own 
outpatient 
clinic, 
the 
Presidential 
Women’s Center, 41 years ago. 
She has been fighting to make sure 
that all women, no matter their age, 
race, or economic status, are able to 
access full reproductive care, including 
abortion. 
Her clinic has treated more than half 
a million women for things like pre-
natal care, HTDs, family planning, and 
pregnancy termination. 
This has been a fulfilling but some-
times dangerous mission. Every week 
for 40 years, the clinic is surrounded by 
protesters who taunt patients as they 
enter for care. 
In 2005, her clinic was burned to the 
ground in an arson attack, but she has 
continued to provide high-quality and 
compassionate care despite the fact 
that she has had to endure so much. 
Again, I want to thank the gentle-
woman for allowing me to talk today. 
It is an honor to recognize Mona 
Reis, an unsung heroine who continues 
to make our communities a safer and a 
healthier place for women and girls. It 
is an honor to know her, to thank her, 
to celebrate her as we recognize Wom-
en’s History Month. 
b 2000 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, it is 
also significant to note that the major-
ity of the diversity in Congress is rep-
resented by the women Members of 
Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY), a fighter for the ERA. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. LAW-
RENCE for her extraordinary leadership. 
In 1921, exactly 100 years ago, just 
after ratifying the 19th Amendment, 
the suffragists set their sights on an-
other constitutional change. The vote 
was not enough for them. They knew 
we needed to put gender equality into 
our Constitution. 
So, these women, among them my 
relative Alice Paul, wrote the equal 
rights amendment. It was first intro-
duced in Congress in 1923 in celebration 
of the 75th anniversary of the Seneca 
Falls Convention, the first women’s 
rights convention in our country. It 
was introduced in the House by Rep-
resentative Daniel Anthony, nephew of 
the great suffragist leader, Susan B. 
Anthony, to honor her work, as well as 
the work of many others, like the great 
suffrage leader Elizabeth Cady Stan-
ton, also of New York. 
Today, 
during 
Women’s 
History 
Month, we honor these women as con-
stitution-makers. But verbal praise 
alone is not enough. We must also 
carry out their wishes. Because now, a 
full 100 years later, the equal rights 
amendment is still not part of the U.S. 
Constitution. 
I thank JACKIE SPEIER and all the 
women and like-minded men in this 
Congress that voted to move the equal 
rights amendment forward. 
Eighty-five percent of U.N. member 
states have constitutions that explic-
itly guarantee equality for women and 
girls. These constitutional guarantees 
have enabled national legal reforms 
that eliminated discriminatory laws 
and helped usher in new laws pro-
tecting girls and women. Where once 
the U.S. was a leader on gender equal-
ity, when it comes to our Constitution, 
we are now far, far behind. 
Today, we must fulfill the hope of 
our suffragist foremothers and make 
equality a reality in our Nation’s most 
fundamental document. 
I must say, throughout this struggle 
I have always said: Where are the 
women? When I walk around the Mall, 
they have museums for everything, but 
not women. It is hard to empower 
women if we don’t even recognize 
them. So this Women’s Caucus put in a 
bill to create a national women’s mu-
seum on the mall. I thought this would 
be easy. It took us two decades to fi-
nally pass it last year, but it is now 
going to be built. It was a priority of 
this caucus, and we made it happen.

I just want to close by saying that 
our Smithsonian Women’s History Mu-
seum will inspire visitors of all ages 
and all genders for generations to 
come. 
I am so glad to join my colleagues for 
tonight’s Special Order to celebrate the 
historical achievements of women and 
to look forward to creating a more 
equal future for all and preserving this 
history 
and 
the 
contributions 
of 
women in the new Smithsonian wom-
en’s museum, which is now going to be 
built on the mall due to this Congress 
and this Women’s Caucus. 
I thank all of my colleagues that 
helped this happen and helped the pas-
sage of the ERA today. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
can’t wait for that museum. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE), an-
other leader and fighter for women’s 
rights. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to thank the 
Democratic Women’s Caucus, Congress-
women Frankel, Speier, and Lawrence, 
for hosting this Special Order on Wom-
en’s History Month. 
I want to thank Congresswoman 
BRENDA LAWRENCE for insisting that 
Black women and women of color be 
seen in this body. 
Last year, we celebrated the centen-
nial of the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment, which gave some women 
the right to vote. We know that women 
of color were not able to vote until dec-
ades later, and Black women fought 
until they got suffrage in 1965. 
I am proud that this January, my 
bill, with the support of both Repub-
licans and Democrats here in this body 
and in the Senate, passed. It is called 
the Women’s History and Nineteenth 
Amendment Centennial Quarter Dollar 
Coin Program Act, and it was signed 
into law. This measure will ensure that 
prominent women from American his-
tory can be honored on our circulating 
quarter dollar coins. 
The currency we use is one of the 
most important shared ways that we 
have in memorializing what is impor-
tant to us as Americans. Making sure 
that prominent American women are 
featured on our coins is an important 
step in recognizing the contributions 
women have made in furthering civil 
rights and making our country a more 
equitable place. 
As the mint solicits public input for 
these coins, it is my hope that diverse 
American women will be chosen and 
depicted, celebrating our Nation’s lead-
ers, thinkers, and innovators. 
Last election also brought a record 
number of women in Congress, and 
there are, I believe, 120 women now in 
the House. I know my mentor, the first 
African-American woman elected to 
Congress, 
Congresswoman 
Shirley 
Chisolm, would be so proud. Yes, we 
brought our folding chairs, but I have 
to just tell you, we are here to stay. 
I salute my late mother, Mildred Par-
ish Massey tonight, who blazed so 
many trails. She instilled in her three 
girls that women are equal to men, 
from day one. 
She was one of the first 12 Black stu-
dents to integrate the University of 
Texas at El Paso. She was the first 
Black female civilian at Fort Bliss, 
Texas, to work there for years, and she 
was the first in so many segregated 
places. 
But you know what? She told my sis-
ters and me that ‘‘can’t’’ is not in the 
dictionary and that we can fulfill our 
dreams. But in doing that, we have to 
break these barriers so that others can 
enter, and she insisted that we open 
the doors for other women and girls. 
It is so important that we celebrate 
Women’s History Month and honor the 
women trailblazers who came before 
us. Not only should we celebrate 
women, but we should also ensure that 
they are protected and granted equal-
ity. I can’t think of a better way to 
honor Women’s History Month than for 
this body to pass bills to guarantee and 
enshrine women’s equality. It is a 
shame we have to do that. 
One important action we can take to 
do that is to remove barriers to ratify-
ing the equal rights amendment. I have 
to thank my good friend, Congress-
woman JACKIE SPEIER, for her leader-
ship on these efforts. It is way past 
time we do that. 
For 244 years, women have not been 
able to claim the full protections and 
opportunities afforded by the Constitu-
tion. Women and girls face a dev-
astating wage gap, gender-based vio-
lence, inadequate access to healthcare, 
pregnancy discrimination, sexual har-
assment, the list goes on. Yet, our Con-
stitution does not explicitly protect 
them, and women of color have had to 
fight twice as hard. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
BRENDA 
LAWRENCE
for 
leading 
the 
Special 
Order tonight. It is an important mo-
ment for women in this country. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank Congresswoman LEE for 
being a voice for women year after year 
after year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Illinois 
(Ms. 
SCHA-
KOWSKY), who has been one of our fight-
ers from the beginning. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to begin my remarks about Wom-
en’s History Month with a little quiz. 
Who was the first woman of color to 
serve in this body, in the United States 
House of Representatives? 
I think I hear somebody saying 
maybe it was Shirley Chisolm. Shirley 
Chisolm 
certainly 
was 
a 
groundbreaking leader, but she was not 
the first woman of color. It was a 
woman named Patsy Mink. 
Patsy Takemoto Mink was born in 
the territory of Hawaii in 1927. She be-
came a lawyer at the University of Chi-
cago. That is my hometown. Not fre-
quent for women to do that. In fact, 
she couldn’t get a job, so she set up her 
own practice. 
But she got really interested in poli-
tics, and she served in the territorial 
House and Senate. And guess what? 
She was the first woman ever to be in 
that body. She was a groundbreaker. 
In 1964, 5 years after Hawaii became a 
State, Patsy ran for the United States 
Congress, the first woman of color and 
the first Asian American and the first 
woman to represent Hawaii. 
She championed early childhood edu-
cation, introduced the first childcare 
bill 
in 
Congress, 
and 
she 
was 
a 
groundbreaker by introducing title IX. 
This was legislation that itself was 
groundbreaking. An amendment to the 
Higher Education Act, title IX, ensured 
that women could not be excluded from 
participating in school activities or 
participating in collegiate athletics. 
Believe me, this was not an easy bill to 
pass. 
That same year, she actually did run 
for President. That was about 2 years 
before Shirley Chisolm did. A very 
short race. She was an anti-Vietnam 
war candidate. Then she dropped out to 
run for Senate and lost that race. 
But she came back to the United 
States Congress to serve once again. I 
have to tell you that I had the pleas-
ure—when I came here in 1999, Patsy 
Mink was here, a fierce and tiny 
woman whom you could not resist. 
I want to say today that we need to 
lift the name of Patsy Mink higher. 
People don’t know who she is or who 
she was or what she accomplished for 
women. I am determined that we will 
do something in this House of Rep-
resentatives to acknowledge and honor 
the great work of Patsy Mink. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. ADAMS), who has been a 
trailblazer in her own right. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentlewoman from Michigan 
and all of the chairs and the co-chairs 
of this committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 
women of the United States House of 
Representatives for Women’s History 
Month. This Women’s History Month 
marks the 101st year of women’s suf-
frage in the United States. 
Despite the fact that women have 
had the right to vote for 101 years, we 
still don’t have equal justice under the 
law. That is why earlier today, we 
passed a resolution to remove the arbi-
trary deadline for the ratification of 
the equal rights amendment, because 
there is no expiration date on equality. 
Yet, to this day, women are still paid 
less for our work, face workplace har-
assment, 
and 
are 
discriminated 
against, simply because of who we are. 
Women who work full-time, year- 
round, still make 82 cents on the dollar 
for men’s earnings. Fighting against 
these disparities and ensuring our Fed-
eral Government and policies are re-
flective of the whole country is why 
having women at every level of govern-
ment is so important, in our House, 
State houses, and, yes, even in the 
White House. 
So this month, in particular, we draw 
strength and inspiration from those

who came before us and those remark-
able women working among us today, 
from Shirley Chisolm, the first Black 
woman to serve in Congress; to NANCY 
PELOSI, the first and only woman 
Speaker of the House; to KAMALA HAR-
RIS, the first female, first African 
American, and first South Asian Amer-
ican Vice President in United States 
history. She was sworn in by the first 
Latina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia 
Sotomayor. 
A 
hundred 
years ago, only one 
woman, Alice Mary Robertson, was 
elected to serve in Congress. Currently, 
a record 144 women were elected to this 
Congress, with 120 women in the House 
of Representatives alone. 
b 2015 
I am proud to say that when I was 
elected and sworn in in 2013, I became 
the 100th woman. However, there is 
still a lot of work to be done; 144 out of 
535 Members is just 25 percent. That is 
just not what our country looks like. 
Women make up over 50 percent of this 
Nation. 
Women’s History Month is a re-
minder of the importance and the ur-
gency of that work and the need for us 
to continue breaking those glass ceil-
ings. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. I thank the gentle-
woman and thank her for being the 
100th woman to enter into Congress. 
I now yield to the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ). 
Mr. Speaker, how much time is re-
maining, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 31 minutes remaining. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. I thank 
Mrs. LAWRENCE so much for gathering 
us all here tonight in celebration, be-
cause celebration is what we must do. 
We must celebrate not just Women’s 
History Month, but everything we did 
today. We must celebrate that we 
passed the extension of the ERA, that 
we passed the Violence Against Women 
Act, that we passed the American Res-
cue Plan with all of those wonderful 
provisions that will lift women and 
children out of poverty. 
I come from a place where for many 
years they didn’t give us the vote, they 
didn’t give us statehood, and there was 
much discrimination. But it was also a 
place where women and women of color 
have a long and proud history of trans-
formative leadership, and I honor a few 
of them today. 
One hundred years ago the suffragist 
Adelina Otero-Warren helped lead the 
charge to ratify the 19th amendment in 
New Mexico. After her success, she be-
came the first Latina to ever run for 
Congress. Unfortunately, she wasn’t 
successful, but 100 years later I am the 
first Latina to represent my district. 
In my family, my grandmother, Isa-
bel Lopez Leger helped to integrate the 
segregated city of Las Vegas, New Mex-
ico, refusing to move when the neigh-
bors realized she was a small, Brown, 
Spanish-speaking Hispana. 
My big grandma, as we called her 
Ganga, Abelina Romero Lucero, under-
stood how central the vote was to 
achieving equity and representation for 
our communities, making calls to mo-
bilize voters from her hospice bed. She 
was a Democrat until she died. 
My mother, Manuelita de Atocha 
Lucero Leger, was punished for speak-
ing Spanish in the schoolyard. She 
took this bigotry and turned it into ad-
vocacy, and she and my father helped 
pass the 1973 New Mexico Bilingual 
Multicultural Education Act because 
she knew that language was so essen-
tial to ‘‘our culture and heritage,’’ 
‘‘nuestra cultura y herencia,’’ and iden-
tity. 
New Mexico also claims Dolores 
Huerta, who proudly taught us that, 
‘‘yes, it can,’’ ‘‘si, se puede.’’ 
I close with New Mexico’s beloved 
daughter, Secretary Deb Haaland of 
the Pueblo of Laguna. New Mexico has 
shed tears of joy over her confirmation. 
She takes to the Department of the In-
terior a fierce voice borne of resilience 
and the love of community and our 
Earth which she inherited from the 34 
generations of New Mexican women be-
fore her. 
Women’s history is still unfolding, 
for we have hard work ahead of us, 
don’t we? Women of color, especially, 
are disproportionately impacted by the 
pandemic, health disparities, and eco-
nomic hardship. So I am so thankful to 
be here with my ‘‘sisters,’’ ‘‘hermanas’’ 
to celebrate our history and to recom-
mit ourselves to the hard work we have 
ahead of us. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. I thank the gentle-
woman so much. We are standing on 
the shoulders of Deb Haaland and my 
amazing mentor and friend, MARCIA 
FUDGE, who have left the Halls of Con-
gress to go to the White House to lead 
the administrative staff. 
I now yield to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a community 
organizer who put her boots on and 
walked the streets, and made change, 
and then blessed us by coming to Con-
gress to continue the fight. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to first and foremost give a great sense 
of thanks and debt of gratitude to my 
colleague, 
BRENDA
LAWRENCE, 
for 
bringing this Special Order hour today, 
as we are really celebrating woman-
hood. That is truly what we are doing 
tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, this month we celebrate 
the amazing and just absolutely inspi-
rational women that are all around us. 
As it has been said over and over again, 
you know, so many amazing women re-
side right here in this body, and I have 
to personally say, I have never met in 
my lifetime a greater number of coura-
geous and intelligent and just amazing 
women that are so committed to de-
mocracy and protecting their constitu-
ents and their communities, and I feel 
very humbled and honored to actually 
get to serve with each and every one of 
them. 
Whether it be a mother or a scientist, 
a Congresswoman or the Vice President 
of the United States, we are eternally 
thankful for the work that women do 
to help us thrive here at home and 
across the globe. 
This week I had the opportunity to 
speak with four amazing women who 
are fighting for change in my commu-
nity in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional 
District. 
Cobb County Chairwoman Lisa Cupid 
has become the first African American 
and first woman to serve in her posi-
tion on the Board of Commissioners. 
Aixa Pascual has dedicated her ca-
reer to engage and advocate for Geor-
gia’s Latino population. 
And after 15 years of teaching, 
Charisse Davis joined the Cobb County 
School Board to implement ideas that 
she learned from her experience as an 
educator. 
Dr. Colleen Kelley, a physician at 
Emory University School of Medicine, 
has worked on the Moderna vaccine 
trial at Grady Hospital. 
I truly want to thank these incred-
ible women for all of the amazing work 
that they have done in our community, 
because it not only serves my commu-
nity, my district, Georgia, but also the 
rest of the Nation. 
I wish everyone a truly happy, happy 
Women’s History Month. But I have to 
honestly say, as I am sitting here 
today listening to all of my colleagues 
talk about the amazing women that we 
know and amazing women who have 
done so much work throughout the 
course of history, I would be remiss if 
I did not mention my own mother, 
Wilma Cecelia Holman. I owe her such 
a great debt of gratitude because she 
was one of the very first women, Black 
women in Illinois to receive a master’s 
in nursing and to actually teach nurs-
ing. So I know that everything that I 
am, all of my courage, my strength, 
my imagination, my creativity, my 
drive, and my willingness to put my 
boots on and get down in the dirt, in 
the trenches for the people that I love 
and care for in my community comes 
from her. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. I thank the gentle-
woman from Georgia. 
I know there is a tradition that says, 
as long as you say the names of your 
forefathers, they will never leave you. 
So I just want to introduce into the 
RECORD Etta Cranford, who was my 
grandmother. At the age of 55, she in-
herited a 3-year-old and 5-year-old 
when my mother died, and she gave ev-
erything she had until her death to en-
sure that I would be a strong Black 
woman in America. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON). 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative LAWRENCE for bringing 
us together for this Special Order hour. 
In honor of Women’s History Month, 
I rise to celebrate the League of 
Women Voters nonpartisan work to en-
courage active and informed participa-
tion in our democracy since 1920. 
Founded shortly before the ratification 
of the 19th amendment, the League has 
always believed in women’s power to 
help create a more perfect democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1488 
March 17, 2021 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
League 
of 
Women Voters of Pennsylvania has 
worked to combat 21st century voter 
suppression tactics, including strict 
voter ID laws and extreme gerry-
mandering. 
In 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court issued a decision in the League 
of Women Voters v. Pennsylvania that 
declared our congressional districts 
had been so extremely gerrymandered 
that they violated our State constitu-
tion. In doing so, that decision created 
districts, including mine, that are 
more compact, contiguous, and con-
stitutional. The League of Women Vot-
ers’ decision paved the way for the 
election of four women, myself in-
cluded, to serve in our State’s congres-
sional delegation at a time when there 
were none. 
From the first suffragists through 
the present day, I want to applaud the 
League of Women Voters for its ongo-
ing work to empower voters and defend 
our democracy. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. I now yield to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
MANNING), a woman who has made a 
difference. I am looking forward to the 
brilliance of her future. 
Ms. MANNING. I would like to thank 
my colleague from my hometown for 
holding this Special Order and for all 
she has done on behalf of women. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to cele-
brate Women’s History Month by high-
lighting the multiple and irreplaceable 
roles that women play in our commu-
nities. 
Generations of women have worked 
to balance jobs with raising children 
and caring for aging loved ones. This 
isn’t new. Women have always dis-
proportionately shouldered the burden 
of caring for family. But for the first 
time, this pandemic has highlighted 
the toll these various roles take on 
women, as so many have been forced to 
leave the workforce to care for others. 
Over the last year, 2.3 million women 
have left the workforce, a nearly 3 per-
cent drop in female participation in 
the labor force. Several factors have 
contributed to this drop, but none 
more than the closing of childcare fa-
cilities and schools. 
The American Rescue Plan is helping 
women recover from this pandemic and 
return to work by bolstering the 
childcare sector, increasing the child 
tax credit, expanding paid leave, and 
safely reopening schools. 
We must treat women with dignity 
and respect and put into place systems 
that allow women to care for their 
families and excel at work. I proudly 
voted to support the American Rescue 
Plan because it is an important step in 
the right direction. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield to the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. ROSS). 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Rep-
resentative LAWRENCE for her leader-
ship and for organizing this Special 
Order hour on this incredible night in 
this incredible month of Women’s His-
tory Month. 
I also want to point out that all three 
women from the North Carolina delega-
tion participated, and that is true sis-
terhood. 
I rise today to highlight an extraor-
dinary North Carolinian in honor of 
Women’s 
History 
Month, 
Reverend 
Nancy Petty. 
Nancy is a trailblazer in the commu-
nity. As a member of the LGBTQ com-
munity and the faith community, she 
has championed marriage equality and 
brought these welcoming ideas to her 
own church, Raleigh’s historic and pro-
gressive 
Pullen 
Memorial 
Baptist 
Church. I worshipped virtually with 
Pullen just last Sunday. 
A kind and compassionate person, 
Nancy often preaches inclusivity and 
understanding. She has focused on fa-
cilitating interfaith dialogue with Ra-
leigh’s Muslim community and has 
partnered with the Jewish community 
on social justice advocacy. 
She truly represents the best of our 
community, and I am honored to call 
her a friend and a neighbor. She has in-
spired a generation by her example to 
treat others the way you would want to 
be treated. 
I am so pleased to recognize Rev-
erend Petty for this Women’s History 
Month and the example she sets for us 
all. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. I thank the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
I now yield to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), our final 
speaker tonight, who came to Congress 
with a mission. She has made her voice 
heard, and she has made such a dif-
ference. We welcome her as not only a 
woman Member of Congress but as an 
amazing Representative. 
b 2030 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, so many of 
the leaders we hear about are public 
figures, elected officials, people with 
loud voices in the community, but 
there are so many other kinds of lead-
ers. In particular, in connection with 
this month’s Women’s History Month, I 
rise to pay tribute to some who are not 
often 
noticed, 
the 
extraordinary 
women who have battled the COVID 
pandemic on its front lines in my com-
munity and across our Nation. 
This historic crisis has devastated 
my community and communities in 
every corner of our country. More than 
530,000 of our fellow Americans have 
died. Millions have lost their jobs. Un-
precedented numbers of children and 
families have faced hunger. 
Women have experienced a dispropor-
tionate share of these converging cri-
ses. As a larger share of frontline work-
ers, they have risen to the occasion, 
putting the health and safety of their 
neighbors ahead of their own. 
One woman in my community, the 
Greater Lehigh Valley of Pennsyl-
vania, has done everything she can to 
make sure these heroes and our most 
vulnerable neighbors are not forgotten. 
Dr. Rajika Reed has served the people 
of our community for more than 20 
years as a counselor, children’s thera-
pist, teacher, public health researcher, 
and epidemiologist. Most recently, Dr. 
Reed has served in one of the hospital 
systems in my community, St. Luke’s 
University Health Network, first as 
senior director of epidemiology and 
strategy and now as vice president of 
community health. 
Dr. Reed has been instrumental in 
keeping 
our 
community 
informed 
throughout the pandemic. Dr. Reed has 
been particularly incisive when speak-
ing about the disproportionate impact 
of COVID on various communities 
throughout the Seventh District, help-
ing all of us recognize and understand 
how rapidly and drastically the stakes 
can change depending on a person’s life 
circumstances. 
By grounding every conversation in 
easy-to-understand data, Dr. Reed has 
made sure that officials at all levels 
have a shared understanding of con-
stituents’ lived reality and the chal-
lenges they face, particularly the stark 
racial and economic disparities that 
have only grown during the pandemic. 
Still, throughout it all, Dr. Reed’s 
warm and calm delivery has helped 
soften the blow of what was at times 
devastating news. Her work has helped 
mobilize my entire community around 
the shared mission of taking care of 
our own and putting the most vulner-
able among us first. 
To Dr. Reed and women frontline 
workers in every corner of my commu-
nity, including many low-wage workers 
who still don’t have the support or pay 
they need, I stand with you. All of us 
stand with you today and every day. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time I have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Michigan has 14 min-
utes remaining. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take this moment to thank ev-
eryone who spoke tonight. 
I want everyone to know that women 
are making so many strides. We are 
currently on target to send women to 
the Moon. We are on target to make 
sure that women continue to be leaders 
in education and healthcare. I am 
proud to say that not only do we have 
a woman as our Vice President, but we 
also have a woman as our amazing 
Speaker of the House. We have six 
chairs of our congressional committees 
headed by women. We also have over, 
as I said, 194 women in Congress cur-
rently. 
With Women’s History Month, some-
times the men will roll their eyes in 
the back of their head and say: Women, 
why do you need a month? Because, so 
often, the strides and hard work that it 
took for us to accomplish what was 
given to privileged men are often over-
looked. 
I am proud to stand here today to 
lead this Special Order hour to honor 
the women, as Congresswoman WILD 
said, the ones who often don’t get a 
platform, don’t get a mic, and they just 
do the work every day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

March 17, 2021 
Women are the predominant group of 
educators. If you are educated in Amer-
ica, you were probably touched by a 
woman. Those who are in hospitals and 
went through COVID and all the suf-
fering, the caregivers and nurses are 
predominantly women. 
We all owe a debt of gratitude to the 
mother who gave birth to us. We are 
often in the kitchens and other places 
that women are such strong leaders, 
but now we have women in the C 
suites. We have women manufacturing 
and designing. We have women in every 
area of America working. 
The only thing that any woman 
wants is the opportunity to have a seat 
at the table to be able to show her bril-
liance. As my grandmother told me, 
never apologize for your hard work, 
your brilliance, or your skills and tal-
ents that you have been blessed with. 
You use them, and you do a good thing 
with them. 
And as John Lewis said, get in good 
trouble. The suffragists taught us that 
the good trouble they went through 
gave us the right to vote in America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
MANAGING THE CRISIS ON THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here on behalf of the freedom- 
loving members of the Republican 
Study Committee, the conservative 
conscience of the GOP Conference, and 
the largest caucus with over 150 mem-
bers and our friend and fearless leader 
JIM BANKS from the Hoosier State. 
Mr. Speaker, we come to this Cham-
ber with grave concerns, with profound 
grief over what is happening to this 
great Nation at the southern border, 
along the border of States like my 
home State of Texas. My citizens are 
on the front lines, and the citizens of 
the Lone Star State and border States 
are at ground zero of this self-inflicted 
crisis. 
Just because the President won’t ac-
knowledge that there is a crisis doesn’t 
mean that it doesn’t exist. Mr. Speak-
er, it is raging out of control. It is an 
unmitigated disaster, and as I said, it 
is self-inflicted. 
Reinstating catch and release while 
we are recovering from a pandemic? 
Are you kidding me? We have put man-
dates and restrictions on the American 
people who have sacrificed by staying 
at home. Some have lost their jobs. 
They don’t know how they are going to 
make ends meet for their family. 
Everybody stepped up, Mr. Speaker. 
They did what they were told to do in 
some cases, but they all acted respon-
sibly for the sake of our country and 
their fellow man and the country that 
they love. And now, we are just letting 
people cross our border illegally, vio-
late our sovereignty, break our laws, 
and then just be released into the inte-
rior of our country with no testing and 
no screening. 
In Texas, Mr. Speaker, we are coming 
back. We have folks back to work. Kids 
are in school. My kids are in school. We 
feel normal again, and we are blessed 
to be in a State that puts a premium 
on individual liberty and personal re-
sponsibility. We have worked hard to 
get to where we are now. 
We didn’t like everything that was 
done to us by our government. We 
didn’t like all the protocols and man-
dates, but we did the best job we could 
for the sake of our fellow Americans. 
Now, we have the potential for a flare- 
up in the pandemic because our hos-
pitals are going to be overwhelmed 
again. 
Our schools are already overwhelmed 
as they try to do right by their stu-
dents, let them come into the class-
room, have that support structure, 
knowing that to close your doors on 
these kids is to close a bright future 
for them. It is to lock them out of their 
greatest potential and to give them 
grief and all kinds of heartache and 
mental health concerns. 
We have our police, who have been 
disparaged with cries to defund the po-
lice. They would be dismantled if the 
bill that passed the House supported by 
the Democrats ever became law and 
ripped away the tools that they have to 
not only keep our community safe but 
to protect them in the process. We 
have stripped them—or would if the 
bill passed—of their legal liability pro-
tections. All the while, we are putting 
more pressure on our local law enforce-
ment to do the job that the Federal 
Government under this Commander in 
Chief has failed to do. 
The Commander in Chief is supposed 
to provide for the common defense. He 
is supposed to be the exemplar for rule 
of law. He is the chief enforcer of the 
law. What kind of example is our Presi-
dent setting to just throw caution to 
the wind and let folks come into this 
country who are not our citizens, 
prioritizing them over the safety and 
health of our citizens? 
I got to hear some of my colleagues 
express concerns over women’s rights 
and protecting women from abuse. We 
all support that, and our hearts go out 
to any victims of abuse in this country 
or any country. But meanwhile, be-
cause of the policies that have been 
passed by this President, reinstating 
catch and release, empowering sanc-
tuary cities, repealing the stay in Mex-
ico policies, halting funding for the 
border wall, all of these things have 
sent a message that we are open for il-
legal business. 
If you ask the cartels, business has 
never been better. We are lining their 
pockets while they exploit vulnerable 
people who are hopeless. They are 
being exploited. 
Mr. Speaker, one out of every three 
women are sexually assaulted on their 
trek to this country. That statistic is 
from Doctors Without Borders. Chil-
dren are used as a passport, trafficked 
by these cartels. We have empowered 
these cartels. This is a disaster on so 
many levels, and I am glad my col-
leagues are here to express these same 
sentiments in their own words. 
Mr. Speaker, I will end with this. It 
is clear there is a cause and effect here. 
It is clear that policies have con-
sequences. They incent behavior, and 
the behavior is causing chaos at the 
border. 
I believe this President is obsessed. 
This is just a fundamental question, 
why our President would allow this to 
happen. I believe he is obsessed with 
undoing anything that has the name 
‘‘President Trump’’ on it, regardless of 
its merits. I believe he is equally ob-
sessed with placating the left and their 
radical agenda. I have come to that 
conclusion. 
Mr. Speaker, we are going to speak 
to this. We are going to tell the truth. 
We are going to lay out the facts. We 
are going to call on our President to do 
the right thing and prioritize the 
American people and their safety and 
security. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my distinguished colleague and 
fellow Member from Texas for yielding. 
Our country’s future will forever be 
changed based on how we manage or 
refuse to manage Biden’s border crisis. 
And, yes, it is a crisis. 
Steady merit-based legal immigra-
tion is stabilizing. It provides a tal-
ented pool of workers, effectively per-
mits patriotic assimilation, and en-
riches our culture. We can debate how 
best to achieve those objectives and 
what immigration levels or numbers 
are in the best interests of our Nation 
and our citizens, but what is not open 
for honest debate, or at least debate 
that honestly places the interests, safe-
ty, and security of American citizens 
first, is the need to secure our border 
and eliminate illegal immigration. 
President Biden’s open border poli-
cies threaten our security, overtax our 
resources, jeopardize public health, and 
turn every town into a border commu-
nity. 
As others have said, without a bor-
der, we don’t have a country; we have 
a landmass, one that is currently under 
invasion. That is an invasion that is 
with 
complicit 
approval 
from 
the 
President’s policies and the support of 
the Democratic Party, and this is espe-
cially egregious and inexcusable. 
b 2045 
The fact is that, in the 56 days since 
President Biden was sworn in on Janu-
ary 20, illegal immigration has surged 
and our southern border has been over-
run. 
We are not stopping illegal immi-
grants based on their inability to pro-
vide for themselves and not be a burden 
on our economy, our social services,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1490 
March 17, 2021 
our education system, our healthcare 
system. 
We are not stopping illegal immi-
grants based on whether or not they 
test positive for COVID. 
We are not stopping illegal immi-
grants based on whether or not they 
have a criminal record. 
We are not stopping illegal immi-
grants based on whether or not they in-
tend to do us harm. 
The bottom line is that we don’t even 
know who is coming, and we don’t even 
know why they are coming. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
President 
sends 
FEMA to the border, not to help pre-
vent the emergency crisis of illegal 
crossing, but actually to help illegal 
aliens get into our country. 
And how does a Democrat majority 
respond? 
With two new amnesty bills that will 
incentivize and reward lawless, illegal 
behavior with amnesty and citizenship. 
Memo to the President and Democrat 
majority: You get more of what you 
incentivize. 
We can only conclude this is what 
they want. 
Mr. Speaker, these two bills com-
bined will provide amnesty to some 5 
million illegal aliens, including some 
with criminal backgrounds. These two 
bills make it more difficult for law en-
forcement to detain or deport illegal 
aliens. These bills will facilitate chain 
migration, leading to more non-merit- 
based immigration. And these two bills 
inexcusably provide no provisions to 
address the Biden border crisis. 
Just today, in apparent recognition 
that the crisis is not playing well with 
the American people—you know, the 
forgotten citizens of the country—NBC 
news—not exactly a conservative news 
outlet—is reporting that the Biden ad-
ministration is telling Border Patrol 
that they can no longer talk to the 
media or do ride-alongs that enable the 
media to see firsthand what is hap-
pening at the border. Instead, Border 
Patrol is supposed to let all commu-
nication come from Washington. 
The American people are not stupid. 
They know what is going on, and they 
don’t want America to be turned into a 
sanctuary nation. 
Mr. Speaker, we, on the Republican 
side, are going to fight for them. We 
are going to fight to protect the coun-
try we have today, and we are going to 
fight to protect the country we want to 
have tomorrow. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia for 
his remarks. He talked about the in-
centives. We talked about cause and ef-
fect, and we talked about the con-
sequences of bad policies. 
Mr. Speaker, we have had double the 
apprehensions this year in January 
over last year in 2020, well over twice 
as many illegal crossings in the month 
of February. We are now 5,000-plus a 
day of people pouring into this coun-
try, 500 a day of illegal minors traf-
ficked here by the cartels. And the CBP 
tells us that there will be over 120,000 
by the end of the year. It will be a 
record year. Those are the results. And 
the facts don’t lie, whether this Presi-
dent or our colleagues believe it or not. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the great State of Texas (Mr. 
BABIN), who represents Texas 36th Con-
gressional District. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair 
of the House Border Security Caucus, I 
very much appreciate the opportunity 
to come to the floor with the Repub-
lican Study Committee to talk about 
the most pressing issue our Nation is 
facing today, right now; and, sadly, it 
was entirely avoidable. 
There are no ifs, ands, or buts. The 
crisis on our southern border is a direct 
result of President Biden’s failed immi-
gration and border security policies— 
miserably failed. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have predictably done what 
they do best: Blamed President Trump 
and his administration. 
But anyone with a pulse can see that 
this border crisis started the very day 
that President Biden was sworn in. On 
his first day in office, Biden stopped 
construction of the border wall, ended 
the national emergency declaration on 
the southern border. He stopped the 
migrant protection protocol so asylum- 
seekers would have to wait in Mexico. 
And rather than utilizing the title 42 
health restrictions to protect Ameri-
cans during this pandemic, Biden and 
his 
administration 
are 
releasing 
COVID-positive 
illegal 
aliens 
into 
Texas to worsen the pandemic and fan 
out across this country. 
He would go on to stop deportation, 
stop enforcing immigration laws, bring 
back ‘‘catch and release,’’ and end the 
hard-won 
changes 
that 
President 
Trump had initiated to control our 
southern border. 
He has specifically said that Ameri-
cans will not be prioritized—repeat: 
Will not be prioritized—over illegal im-
migrants for access to COVID–19 vac-
cines, and promised citizenship to mil-
lions upon millions of migrants here il-
legally, 
which 
does 
nothing 
but 
incentivize more illegal crossings. All 
of this in less than 2 months. 
Who on earth is surprised that there 
is a massive border crisis? 
Yes, President Biden owns this bor-
der crisis. The truly sad reality is this 
isn’t Biden’s first rodeo. When he was 
vice president, he saw surges on the 
border, and he knows full well what ex-
actly that means. 
He saw children being used and recy-
cled by smugglers. He saw women and 
children physically abused, raped, and 
even murdered by the cartels, who 
fully control our southern border now, 
empowered by President Biden. He 
even saw American families torn apart 
after a loved one was killed by a dan-
gerous criminal illegal alien. 
He should know better. And you 
know what? He does know better. Un-
fortunately, he is controlled by politics 
and his radical leftwing base, and he 
won’t turn back now. 
The American people deserve to 
know that President Biden is taking 
advantage of them through this crisis. 
And while the American people were 
locked down for a year because of the 
pandemic, illegal aliens roamed free. 
While they worked hard, paid their 
taxes, and saved just to get by, illegal 
immigrants cost them billions every 
year 
with 
free 
education 
and 
healthcare. 
My great State of Texas and the 
other border States cannot take an-
other minute of Biden’s border crisis. 
The President of the United States 
needs to step up and he needs to lead. 
Lives are at stake. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
his remarks. He mentioned as one of 
the policies that this current President 
has put in place through a unilateral 
action—by the way, he has done more 
executive orders than the last three or 
four Presidents combined—was to re-
peal or rescind the national emergency 
declaration. But it is so rich, so rich 
that at the same time he is doing this, 
the Democrat leadership of the House 
under Speaker PELOSI has lined the 
streets around the perimeter of the 
Capitol with the National Guard. The 
height of hypocrisy. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
aren’t buying this. They are not. The 
Speaker called the walls at the south-
ern border protecting our fellow Ameri-
cans and communities immoral, until 
she erected razor-wire fencing around 
the people’s House. It is offensive. It is 
shameful, and it is an outrage. And it 
is a double standard, if I have ever seen 
one. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. HERN), a good 
friend of mine, and a colleague rep-
resenting Oklahoma’s First District. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
distinguished colleague from Texas for 
yielding. I appreciate him leading this 
Special Order on such an important 
issue in our great country. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
shed light on a situation that is get-
ting worse by the minute. The longer 
Joe Biden and his White House ignore 
the crisis on our border, the more chal-
lenging it becomes to get it under con-
trol. 
But one would have to wonder: Is 
that what he wants by allowing this to 
continue on? 
Under President Trump, border secu-
rity was a top priority. He was ridi-
culed for that top priority of securing 
our Nation, the sovereignty of our Na-
tion. Illegal entries plummeted under 
President Trump, and over 450 miles of 
border wall were built at the fighting 
and 
scratching 
every 
single 
way 
against our Democrat colleagues’ de-
sires. 
Mr. Speaker, Biden’s trend has been 
to reverse and dismantle anything and 
everything 
that 
President 
Trump 
touched over the last 4 years, no mat-
ter who it may hurt. On day one of his 
Presidency, he unconstitutionally halt-
ed congressionally appropriated funds

meant to secure and strengthen our 
southern border. He indicated a com-
plete reversal on border policies, refus-
ing to condemn Democrats who call for 
open borders. This led to thousands of 
immigrants to believe our borders were 
open and they could enter with no con-
sequences. They even had shirts pro-
moting the idea that Biden should let 
them in. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been less than 2 
months since Biden took office and al-
ready the situation at our southern 
border has reached unprecedented lev-
els, levels like we haven’t seen in 20 
years. Border agents are reporting the 
number of illegal entries, especially 
children, is higher than we have seen in 
decades. 
Detainment 
facilities—what 
the 
Democrats have now called reception 
centers and concentration camps; that 
is what they called them under Presi-
dent Trump—are over capacity. Chil-
dren are being sent to Dallas, hundreds 
of miles away from the border, to be 
held at the convention center. 
Americans returning from abroad are 
required to take COVID tests before re-
entering our own country, but Biden is 
allowing thousands of migrants into 
the country without even testing them 
for COVID, packing facilities way over 
capacity. 
Hypocrisy is nothing new to this ad-
ministration. In spite of everything I 
have already said, Biden refuses to call 
it a crisis. CNN is even calling it a cri-
sis, but Biden doesn’t want to label it. 
He doesn’t want to own it, calling it an 
inherited mess from the Trump admin-
istration. Every single person in Amer-
ica knows that is not true. To make it 
worse, House Democrats rejected any 
amendments on their partisan immi-
gration bills this week. 
My amendments asked that known 
gang members not be eligible for am-
nesty. 
How could you not allow that to be 
added to this bill? 
That we create a tax credit for em-
ployers who want to do the right thing 
and implement E-Verify in their com-
panies to make sure they are hiring 
legal American workers, and that ille-
gal immigrants who have committed 
crimes in our country not be eligible 
for amnesty. Now, everywhere—except 
for in Congress—any good American 
would want those in the bill. But not 
here, not my Democrat colleagues. 
These are all commonsense ideas 
that a vast majority of Americans sup-
port, but Democrats would rather have 
open borders with no consequences for 
those who break the laws in our coun-
try. 
Just this week, four people on the 
terrorist watch list were caught at-
tempting to illegally entered our coun-
try. If we lower the standards and re-
strictions on our border, we know we 
never would have caught them. We 
wouldn’t have even known that they 
were here. That should scare us all to 
death. 
Mr. Speaker, I and many of my Re-
publican colleagues have been to the 
border to see this terrible situation 
firsthand. I would encourage every 
Member of Congress to go see it. And 
for that, I thank my colleagues for 
standing up here tonight at this hour, 
for speaking up on this crisis. It is so 
important to the American people and 
the sovereignty of our Nation. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, 
our neighbor to the north, for his re-
marks. He mentioned that some polit-
ical opportunists were characterizing 
these detention facilities under the 
leadership of President Trump as con-
centration camps. They called the men 
and women in uniform, our sons and 
daughters, who were called to duty to 
come 
alongside 
the 
Border 
Patrol 
agents to secure our southern border 
and defend our people, ‘‘storm troop-
ers.’’ They referred to our attempt to 
humanely and safely detain the unac-
companied minors as ‘‘kids in cages.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, where are they now? 
Where are they now? 
Where is the outrage? 
Where is the indignation? 
Where is the name calling? 
How soon we forget. 
Mr. Speaker, 13,000 children are being 
detained right now in far worse condi-
tions and far more crowded than be-
fore. 
Where are those colleagues of ours 
that were clanging gongs and sounding 
the alarm? 
b 2100 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the great State of Wisconsin (Mr. 
TIFFANY), 
my 
colleague, 
who 
rep-
resents the Seventh Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s border is 
under siege, and it is a siege that this 
administration continues to encourage 
with each passing day. 
They say it is not a crisis or an emer-
gency, even as they have dispatched 
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency, to help manage the 
disaster that they have created. 
In 
February 
alone, 
the 
shortest 
month of the year, overwhelmed border 
patrol agents encountered more than 
100,000 illegal aliens crossing our south-
ern border, including 30,000 unaccom-
panied children and minors. And that 
does not include the countless illegal 
aliens that slipped through undetected. 
Mr. Speaker, as many as 25 percent of 
the illegal aliens that the border patrol 
apprehends are testing positive for 
COVID—and not all are being tested. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
administration’s 
catch-and-release policies, many of 
these aliens immediately board buses 
and fan out across the country, making 
every State a border State. That in-
cludes my State in the far north, Wis-
consin, because I hear it from sheriffs 
and law enforcement all over northern 
Wisconsin, especially the drugs that 
flow 
in, 
the 
fentanyl, 
the 
methamphetamines, that flow into our 
communities killing our citizens. 
Drug seizures were up more than 50 
percent last month driven by huge 
spikes in meth and heroin, deadly poi-
sons that ravage our families. In what 
is fast becoming a Washington tradi-
tion, the other side has tried to pass 
the buck and blame the border disorder 
on the last administration. 
This is a tired talking point; one we 
will hear repeated over and over to ex-
plain away the policy failures of the 
one-party government they control. 
But facts are stubborn things. 
This tidal wave of drug and human 
trafficking is a direct result of White 
House promises of amnesty, and the 
rollback of the commonsense border se-
curity safeguards put in place by Presi-
dent Trump. That is why it began at 
the end of January. 
So what is their answer to this crisis? 
It is to pour gasoline on the fire by 
passing two amnesty bills that will 
give legal status to at least half of the 
estimated 11 million illegal aliens al-
ready in this country, including crimi-
nal aliens who have been convicted of 
multiple DUIs, drug and weapons viola-
tions, and even voter fraud. 
One of the bills even includes an un-
believable provision allowing for the 
reimportation of foreigners who were 
deported as long as 4 years ago, bring-
ing them back and giving them green 
cards. This is a slap in the face to the 
legal immigrants who have followed 
our laws. This is a slap in the face to 
American taxpayers, millions of unem-
ployed Americans, and countless Amer-
ican families who have lost loved ones 
to the scourge of drugs like meth and 
fentanyl. 
Even worse, it is a financial bonanza 
for the human traffickers and foreign 
drug cartels who prey on the vulner-
able and profit from their misery. 
So let’s get this straight. The first 
act of this President was to open the 
borders and close our schools, or make 
sure that they stay closed. The first 
act of this President was to open the 
borders, the pipeline that brings the 
drugs and the human trafficking into 
America, but they closed the pipeline 
that gives us energy independence in 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for the admin-
istration to stop pretending that this 
crisis isn’t happening, and to start de-
fending the American people. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, lis-
tening to the gentleman, it is just hard 
to believe that in the greatest country 
on planet Earth, that this is what we 
are allowing to happen. Reimporting 
people who violated our laws, had due 
process, and we did what the law says, 
detain and deport. 
Today, under Present Biden’s deluge 
of executive orders, they are released 
and rewarded: free healthcare, com-
pliments of the taxpayers of the United 
States; free education, compliments of 
the taxpayers of the United States. We 
spend $12 billion in Texas alone on ille-
gal immigration, and the price has just

climbed higher and higher under this 
President. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP), my 
dear friend, representing the Ninth 
Congressional District. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas, my friend, Mr. ARRINGTON, for 
hosting this Special Order, it is an ex-
traordinarily important topic. 
Here is another angle on it. Tomor-
row, on the floor of this House, Demo-
crats will pass two mass amnesty bills, 
H.R. 6 and H.R. 1603. Consider that at 
the very time Democrats are bringing 
these amnesty bills to the floor, what 
promises to be the largest surge of ille-
gal immigration on the southern bor-
der in at least 20 years, is building to-
ward an unknown climax. The Biden 
administration has precipitated a hu-
manitarian crisis so big that even they 
can no longer deny it. 
Less than 2 months after terminating 
President Trump’s declaration of an 
emergency on the border, Secretary 
Mayorkas of the Department of Home-
land Security, has been constrained to 
send FEMA, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, to facilitate the 
Nation’s response to this crisis. 
Today, in the Committee on Home-
land 
Security, 
I 
asked 
Secretary 
Mayorkas about the deliberate and ab-
surd rhetoric used by the administra-
tion: Come, but don’t come now. 
I was unable to secure from Sec-
retary Mayorkas a straightforward ac-
knowledgment that it is always wrong 
to incite migrants to enter the United 
States illegally. 
And, amazingly, when I asked the 
Secretary whether he and the Biden ad-
ministration had been expected or were 
surprised by the crisis that is now 
blooming on the southern border, he 
was caught off guard. He said he had no 
expectation whatsoever. I couldn’t be-
lieve it, and I don’t think the American 
people can believe it. 
Just like the Biden administration’s 
rhetoric, these bills signal economic 
migrants that if they make the dan-
gerous trek through Central America 
and Mexico, they will be met with am-
nesty, 
taxpayer-funded 
healthcare, 
housing, and anything else you can 
think of. 
Whether it is gutting the migrant 
protection protocols, otherwise known 
as ‘‘remain in Mexico,’’ and stopping 
border wall construction, the adminis-
tration’s message to migrants is clear: 
Come. Take your lives in your hands, 
brave the gangs, the coyotes, the smug-
glers, take the risk of sexual abuse. 
Come. 
Today, 
the 
Democrats 
are 
aug-
menting 
that 
clear-as-day 
message 
with more promises of amnesty, and 
that will be the bills tomorrow, which 
everyone here know will fuel more ille-
gal migration. 
Let’s face it, Democrats are com-
mitted to a regime of open borders, 
where any person from anywhere in the 
world has a right to enter the U.S. for 
any reason, even if that means mi-
grants are assaulted or killed on their 
way to the border. And Democrats feel 
better about themselves. They assume 
a superior moral position by pursuing 
such a policy. 
It is no wonder, but apparently no 
cause for reflection by the Biden ad-
ministration, that the CBP very re-
cently apprehended four individuals on 
the terrorist watch list crossing the 
southwest border. Secretary Mayorkas 
admitted that today, and then went on 
to say: Well, it is nothing unusual, 
more or less. Amazing. 
I have heard some of my friends on 
the other side of the aisle complain 
that Republicans are not offering solu-
tions. 
Let me offer three: End all talk of 
amnesty. Reinstate the migrant pro-
tection protocols that provide more for 
their safety than the policy does now 
articulate. And finish building the 
wall. Let’s resume a responsible border 
policy. Let’s consider, for once, the in-
terests of the American people. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Caro-
lina. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I would say that 
America is the most generous Nation, 
not only the most powerful, but the 
most generous. We represent 5 percent 
of the world population, and we rep-
resent 20 percent of the immigrant pop-
ulation. We welcome freedom-loving, 
law-abiding people who want to make 
America their home and make a better 
life for their family, but only if they 
respect our laws and our sovereignty 
and the safety of the American people. 
Millions of people wait for years to 
have legal status in this country, and 
this President has just created lawless-
ness and chaos, just like that, with a 
pen and a cell phone. The unilateral ac-
tions have been reckless and endan-
gered not only our citizens, but the 
poor people that are making this trek 
on account of his message: Don’t come 
now, is what he says, but come now. 
Come one, come all. It is a free-for-all 
at the border, is what his policies say 
loudly and clearly. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to my dear 
friend from the great State of Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN), he represents Ar-
kansas’ Fourth Congressional District. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
Republican party has historically been, 
and I believe is still today, the voice 
for those who have no voice. We value 
life and believe all people should be 
treated with dignity. 
I appreciate the gentleman from 
Texas for leading this discussion to-
night, for his compassion for people, 
and for his passion to serve Texas and 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, tonight, I not only rise 
to address the growing crisis on our 
southern border, but to be a voice for 
the persecuted. In an interview aired 
this morning, President Biden told mi-
grants not to come to the United 
States, but still refused to recognize 
the situation as a crisis. Actions speak 
louder than words. It doesn’t matter 
what you say when it doesn’t match 
what you do. 
Such a directive is pointless, consid-
ering there are no policy changes to de- 
motivate the migrant surge, the likes 
of which the United States hasn’t seen 
in 20 years. Our facilities and agencies 
are being overwhelmed by the surge. 
President Biden offered an open invi-
tation for parents to send their chil-
dren across the border without fear of 
being turned away. The result is cata-
strophic. While there have been mi-
grant surges in the past, there has 
never been such a prolific number of 
unaccompanied minors. 
These policies are a driving incentive 
for parents to give their children to 
coyotes and traffickers who will abuse 
and use them, causing lifelong trauma. 
Over 500 children are crossing the bor-
der daily, including unaccompanied 
kids as young as 6 years old. These 
children are threatened and coerced by 
cartels to carry drugs over the border 
and exploited by sex traffickers. 
One in three women—one in three 
women, Mr. Speaker, will be assaulted 
as they attempt to make the journey. 
I just witnessed my colleagues from 
across the aisle spending an hour hon-
oring women’s history. What kind of 
history are the left’s policies writing 
for these women? Young women, young 
women as young as 13 years old are 
being lured to Texas with the promise 
of a job in the service industry, and in-
stead, are being sexually abused and 
trafficked. 
b 2115 
What we are seeing now is but a frac-
tion of what we could see in the coming 
months. This is the Biden administra-
tion’s responsibility, and President 
Biden owes the American people an-
swers. 
But President Biden is not alone. The 
majority party is neglecting their over-
sight responsibilities and aiding and 
abetting these dangerous actions. 
I am calling on President Biden and 
congressional Democrats—who I re-
mind you are the majority in both 
Chambers—to take responsibility for 
the border crisis and work to fix it and 
to take responsibility for the trauma 
these children will endure on the jour-
ney across the border. 
Customs and Border Protection has 
informed Congress that four people on 
the FBI’s terrorist watch list were ap-
prehended at the border. If four were 
caught, how many got through? What 
is their intent? 
One 
day, 
Democrats 
are 
the 
arsonists, and the next week, the fire-
fighters. They have pulled this trick on 
every issue, including energy, Medi-
care, and now our border. To bring par-
tisan immigration bills to the floor 
without even an opportunity to amend 
the bills is bad governance anytime, 
but it is downright insensitive during 
this crisis. 
We are a nation of immigrants, and I 
support all legal immigration. But

open border policies are a direct threat 
to our national security and have cre-
ated a humanitarian crisis. We should 
secure our borders and work on bipar-
tisan legislation to address immigra-
tion issues, but Democrats refuse to 
even enforce existing laws. 
Mr. Speaker, what good is a new im-
migration law when there is no evi-
dence that it will be enforced? 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
for his heartfelt comments. 
Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much 
time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 21 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, as 
you have heard from my colleagues, 
there are many levels and dimensions 
to this crisis. It is a national security 
crisis, Mr. Speaker. It is a public 
health and safety crisis. It is a humani-
tarian crisis of epic proportions, and it 
is only going to get worse until this 
President embraces the reality, resists 
the left’s influence, and steps up and 
becomes the leader that our country 
needs at a time like this. 
I thank the gentleman from Wis-
consin for joining us in this Special 
Order. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN), who 
represents Wisconsin’s Sixth Congres-
sional District. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
have already talked tonight about the 
numbers which come from the crisis at 
the southern border. 
During the Obama administration, 
Mr. Speaker, if you had 1,000 contacts a 
day with people trying to sneak in this 
country, that was a lot. We are now at 
around 3,000 a day. February of this 
year compared to February of last year 
is up 173 percent. That is shocking. It 
didn’t have to be. 
What incompetence did it take to get 
such a massive swing of people coming 
across our border? 
President 
Trump 
had 
something 
called the migrant protection protocol. 
When people tried to sneak in here and 
claim asylum, they were sent back and 
held by the Mexican Government pend-
ing a hearing. This was a great victory 
for President Trump. 
Maybe just because he is President 
Trump, it means you don’t like him, 
Mr. Speaker, and you had to get rid of 
him like the protection protocol. So, 
we are back to the old days. 
Rather than being held south of the 
border, waiting to see if you can come 
here, you are escorted into the United 
States, turned over to some nonprofit 
organization, and told to disappear 
somewhere in the United States to 
show up for a hearing which you don’t 
show up for. And that is, more than 
any other reason, why we have this 
problem. 
Another thing they have changed is 
that President Trump had worked on a 
deal with Central American countries 
so that people trying to come up here 
from South America and other Central 
American countries were held south of 
the Mexican border. One more good 
policy, but let’s throw it overboard and 
see what happens. 
By doing this, not only do we let 
more people in the country, but we en-
rich and empower the drug cartels. The 
drug cartels are charging about $3,000 
for every Mexican they let in here, 
about $5,000 for every Central Amer-
ican, $8,000 to $9,000 for every Brazilian, 
and up to $20,000 for every Asian. 
When you are making that kind of 
money, Mr. Speaker, you know very 
well the drug cartels will recruit as 
many people as they can to come into 
this country. 
Of course, nowadays, it is unlike 
years ago when they used to find mari-
juana. Now when people come across 
the border, it is fentanyl, meth, and 
heroin. So, in addition to the huge 
amount of humanity moving across the 
border, we have that many more drugs 
to kill the people of our country. I am 
sure the American people already re-
member we are losing about 80,000 peo-
ple every year to illegal drug use, so 
much of which comes across the south-
ern border. 
As has been mentioned by other 
speakers, there is an increase in sexual 
assaults as people try to come across 
the border and are escorted by the drug 
cartels. 
I want to point out that the drug car-
tels control that southern border. If 
you try to come here without their ap-
proval, Mr. Speaker, you are in big 
trouble. I will give you an anecdote 
from the last time I was down there. 
Three people tried to escort other peo-
ple over the border. Two of them were 
skinned alive and died. The other was 
partly skinned alive and told to go 
back south to Mexico and tell everyone 
what happens if you try to come across 
the border without going through the 
drug cartels. 
Just as another indication of the 
huge problem we have at the border, 
last year, which was an unusually hot 
year, they found, in the Tucson sector 
alone, 100 bodies of people who dehy-
drated trying to come here. 
Under President Trump, Mr. Speaker, 
you know how good it can be. They 
went from a point where they were let-
ting 100,000 people across the border, 
which was about 2 years ago, back 
down to, around December, about 10,000 
people crossing the border. They did 
that with the migrant protection pro-
tocol, with dealing with Central Amer-
ica, and by being concerned about 
COVID. 
So, what to do now? I am sometimes 
asked how the United States got in 
this mess, and I am talking about a 
wide variety of issues. Where would the 
Founding Fathers say they screwed up? 
Until this, I always felt that if I look 
at the three branches of government 
and say between the legislative, execu-
tive, and judiciary, our Founding Fa-
thers would have never believed the ju-
diciary could have such complete lack 
of respect for the Constitution. But 
now, I have to answer something else. 
The press sometimes considers them-
selves the fourth estate. There are ru-
mors right now that the Department of 
Homeland Security has put a gag order 
on the Border Patrol agents who al-
ways have so many interesting stories 
down there. If I think of our Founding 
Fathers now who wanted a free press, 
as disappointed as they would be in our 
President, as disappointed as they 
would be in our Congress, and as super 
disappointed as our Founding Fathers 
would be in our judicial branch, I think 
the area they would be most dis-
appointed is in the fourth estate. The 
bootlicking sycophants of the fourth 
estate are just horrible. These toadies 
are ruining the country. 
Wake up. Insist on being able to talk 
to the Border Patrol. Get down to the 
Border Patrol and find out exactly 
what is going on. 
Mr. Speaker, my final plea tonight is 
for the press corps to wake up, get to 
the southern border, and report what is 
really going on down there. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Wisconsin 
for his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that this admin-
istration and our current President, 
Joe Biden, would do well to take a page 
out of President Trump’s playbook, 
and I mean this with all sincerity. 
The reason people by the millions 
followed 
this 
unconventional, 
non-
politician businessman and leader is 
because they were convinced he would 
fight for them. It is because they 
watched as he followed through on 
what he promised he would do for 
them. And lastly, Mr. Speaker, it is be-
cause he put America first. 
Perfect he was not, but I will tell you 
what, Mr. Speaker, with every fiber of 
his being and ounce of strength in 
every waking moment, he was vigilant 
in keeping those promises, and one of 
them was to secure the border and stop 
illegal immigration once and for all. 
Politicians have come and gone. 
They have made the same promises but 
to no avail. President Trump reduced 
illegal crossings by 75 percent. 
We know what to do in this Chamber. 
We know the policies that would work 
to protect our fellow Americans, secure 
our border, and stop this chaos and 
madness that has ensued as a result of 
these 
reckless, 
unilateral 
decisions 
that this President is making. 
We know what to do, Mr. Speaker, 
but there is no political will to do it. 
The message, as we have said, is clear. 
It is demoralizing and insulting that 
the leadership of this administration 
and our Commander in Chief have 
prioritized illegal immigrants over our 
own citizens. 
I am wearing a mask in the people’s 
House. Most of our colleagues, Mr. 
Speaker, have been vaccinated or have 
had COVID. We have social distancing, 
and we are still wearing masks. What a 
pathetic posture as we just release 
hundreds every day, thousands upon

thousands—some say the infection rate 
is upward of 20 percent—into the inte-
rior of our country and into our com-
munities while we the American people 
have spent trillions of dollars and made 
untold sacrifices to help our country 
get back to its feet. It is just unbeliev-
able. 
Those poor Border Patrol agents, 
who have had to hear that they too 
should be defunded, are hamstrung, at 
best. They see the revolving door. 
How would you like to go to work 
every day, Mr. Speaker, with a clear 
mission, and a righteous and patriotic 
mission, to secure the border and pro-
tect your citizens and have a Com-
mander in Chief who says come one, 
come all, and has such little regard for 
the rule of law and for those who risk 
their lives every day to enforce it? 
These are just the cold, hard facts. It 
is the truth. I believe, and always have, 
in the American people’s good judg-
ment. While some folks may have had 
an aversion to the style and person-
ality of the last President—I can appre-
ciate that—they have to look back and 
say that he achieved unprecedented re-
sults 
that 
left 
this 
Nation 
safer, 
stronger, and more prosperous than we 
have been in recent history, if ever. 
Mr. Speaker, I pray our country will 
return to that level of strength, and I 
pray this President will embrace the 
facts and reality. I hope he comes to 
visit border States like Texas and lis-
tens to the cries that have gone un-
heard from his administration, from 
the people of Texas, Arizona, New Mex-
ico, California, and throughout this 
land who need him to step up and be 
our Commander in Chief. 
Mr. Speaker, I am done, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

a secretary for a medical services and 
transport company in Puerto Rico. Her 
interest was sparked through each 
EMS call, which offered her a chance 
to help a person or family in need. 
She eventually became a dispatcher 
and discovered her passion for caring 
for others was her calling, not just a 
career 
focus.

doctorate in ministry. Specializing in 
both nursing and ministry has helped 
her be an uplifting resource for pa-
tients and their families in their time 
of need.

passion and efforts to make a positive 
impact in the lives of others, she re-
ceived The DAISY Award for Extraor-
dinary Nurses in 2018. Today, her dedi-
cation to helping others is stronger

Polk County Public Schools. She trans-
ferred schools to help overcome turn-
around status and provide a consistent, 
quality education to all students. 
She is an accomplished visionary 
leader with 5 years of teaching experi-
ence in Polk County. She stops at 
nothing to advocate for what is best for 
her students and teachers all over the 
State of Florida. 
Some of Ms. Cyran’s most notable ac-
complishments in education include 
being named to NPR’s Best Commence-
ment Speeches Ever list in 2014 for her 
graduation speech from Niagara Uni-
versity; 
being 
nominated 
for 
the 
Touchdown for Teachers award in 2010, 
2011, 2014 and 2016, given by the Na-
tional Football League’s Buffalo Bills 
for dedication to the community in 
which she lived; the 2018 Distinguished 
Alumni Award from Niagara Univer-
sity, New York; and the Polk County 
Teacher of the Year award for 2019. 
Since moving to Florida, she became 
very involved in Polk County Special 
Olympics and has helped coach sports 
such as bowling, softball, swimming, 
and bocce. She plays unified sports 
with her brother, Philip, who has au-
tism. Unified sports gives the oppor-
tunity to teach acceptance through 
competitive play while mentoring ath-
letes who have a cognitive disability so 
that they can build relationships with 
others and be more successful in every-
day life. In the summer of 2018, she was 
named Polk County’s Most Inspira-
tional Unified Partner of the Year. 
Ms. Cyran is currently completing 
her doctorate in educational leadership 
from Florida Southern College and as-
pires to be a principal someday. She is 
a living example of Rita Pearson’s 
quote: ‘‘Every child deserves a cham-
pion: an adult who will never give up 
on them, who understands the power of 
connection and insists that they be-
come the best they can possibly be.’’ 
For this and more, Ms. Jennie Cyran, 
we honor you.

HONORING FRANCISCO H. DE JESUS 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of National 
Borinqueneers Day on April 13, I would 
like to recognize Francisco H. De 
Jesus. 
Francisco H. De Jesus was born on 
March 9, 1924, in the small town of 
Penuelas, Puerto Rico. In 1950, he was 
one of the Borinqueneers that was de-
ployed to the Korean war on the USNS 
Marine Lynx. Francisco served for 1 
year in the Korean war and then trans-
ferred to Panama for a tour as a Mili-
tary Police member. 
Upon completing his active service, 
Francisco returned to Puerto Rico, re-
joining his young family in San Juan. 
He was an entrepreneur, pursuing nu-
merous business ventures before estab-
lishing a very well-known men’s store 
called Heryck’s Men’s Store in Caparra 
Terrace. 
In 1976, Francisco sold his beloved 
store and moved his family to Orlando, 
Florida. 
For 
20 
years, 
Francisco 
worked for the Orange County School 
Board as a community liaison in the 
immigration department. He played a 
pivotal role in registering migrant 
families and their children to enable 
attendance at local schools during the 
year. 
Francisco is a beloved husband, fa-
ther of seven children, grandfather of 
14, and great-grandfather of 16. He is 
still an avid storyteller, loves listening 
to music, and is great dominoes player. 
Francisco recently celebrated his 
97th birthday in Orlando, Florida. 
For this and more, Mr. Francisco H. 
De Jesus, we honor you. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER KEVIN 
VALENCIA 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of Officer Kevin 
Valencia of the Orlando Police Depart-
ment, who was a courageous and heroic 
officer, a loving husband, father, son, 
brother, and friend. 
On June 11, 2018, Officer Kevin Valen-
cia was shot and critically injured 
while responding to a domestic vio-
lence call where a deranged individual 
took his own life after killing four chil-
dren and shooting Officer Valencia. 
Officer Valencia risked his life for 
people he didn’t even know, a risk that 
many in the law enforcement profes-
sion take every day without question. 
Since that tragic night, Officer Valen-
cia has been fighting for his life with 
his family by his side. 
Regretfully, Officer Valencia passed 
away this week on March 15, 2021, after 
succumbing to the injuries he sus-
tained. 
Officer Kevin Valencia will be re-
membered by his loved ones as a hero, 
who selflessly gave to others and al-
ways had the best humor. 
He is survived by his wife, Meghan 
Valencia, and their two sons, Kaleb and 
Kolton. 
Thank you, Kevin Valencia, officer of 
OPD, for your great sacrifices. We 
mourn your passing, and may you rest 
in peace. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

S1577 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2021 
No. 50 
Senate 
(Legislative day of Tuesday, March 16, 2021) 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m., on the 
expiration of the recess, and was called 
to order by the Honorable MARTIN 
HEINRICH, a Senator from the State of 
New Mexico. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Father in Heaven, bless our Senators. 
May they strive to act with integrity. 
Guide them to listen to the voice of 
conscience, seeking to please You with 
their motives as well as their actions. 
Lord, give them such ethical congru-
ence that their words will be validated 
by laudable actions. Test their hearts 
with Your unfailing love, empowering 
them to become instruments of Your 
peace. Mighty God, keep their feet on 
solid ground. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, March 17, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable MARTIN HEINRICH, a 
Senator from the State of New Mexico, to 
perform the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. HEINRICH thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
PPP EXTENSION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
second, I will move the PPP bill to the 
floor. I hope—and I ask our Republican 
colleagues to cooperate—that we can 
move this bipartisan PPP proposal 
without delay. It passed the House 
overwhelmingly. A vast majority of 
Democrats and Republicans voted for 
it. I hope we can move it quickly here 
in the Senate as it expires on March 31, 
and there are some changes that were 
made in the ARP that people need time 
to adapt to and implement. To allow a 
lapse would not be the right thing to 
do for so many of our small business 
people across the country. So I am hop-
ing that our Republican colleagues will 
move the bill with the same alacrity 
with which it passed in the House with 
an overwhelmingly bipartisan major-
ity. I think there were fewer than 10 
votes against it. 
f 
MEASURE READ THE FIRST 
TIME—H.R. 1799 
Mr. SCHUMER. With that, Mr. Presi-
dent, I understand that there is a bill 
at the desk, and I ask for its first read-
ing. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the bill by 
title for the first time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1799) to amend the Small Busi-
ness Act and the CARES Act to extend the 
covered period for the paycheck protection 
program, and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I now ask for a sec-
ond reading, and in order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I object to my own 
request. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will receive its second reading on 
the next legislative day.

GEORGIA SHOOTINGS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
let me proceed to my remarks. 
First, on the terrible tragedy in 
Georgia, the people of Atlanta, GA, and 
the surrounding communities were just 
shocked last night by a series of shoot-
ings that left eight people dead, six of 
whom were of Asian descent. 
The motivations behind this dev-
astating tragedy are still unknown, but 
there is a legitimate concern that 
these killings may have been racially 
motivated. Over the past year, the 
Asian-American community has faced 
a rising tide of abuse and violence in 
the wake of COVID–19, driven by igno-
rance, by misinformation, and by age- 
old prejudices against the Asian-Amer-
ican 
community. 
Tragically, 
hate 
crimes against Asian Americans have 
skyrocketed. 
There is bigotry in the land and far 
too much of it. These dark forces have 
always existed in America, but, re-
cently, they seem to have been un-
leashed. The sort of superego that puts

these things down seems to have weak-
ened, 
and 
the 
id 
seems 
to 
have 
strengthened. 
We cannot lose for a moment our vig-
ilance against these forces of hate, in-
tolerance, bigotry, and discrimination. 
I love the Asian American commu-
nity. They have done so much for 
America. I see it in my borough of 
Brooklyn, in my city and State of New 
York, and throughout the country— 
hard-working people, people who do so 
much for our country at every level. 
They are welcome here. That is Amer-
ica. Yet, bigots have increased hate 
crimes and maybe even possibly led to 
the deaths of these people. 
So I hope that all Americans first 
will realize that there is too much hate 
in the land, that hate against one 
group is hate against any group, and 
we should all, Americans of every 
background and race and creed, color, 
and religion, gender, and sexual ori-
entation, band together against the 
haters. It is so un-American. 
E pluribus unum—out of many, one. 
That is what America has always been. 
That is what America must continue to 
be, and our voices must speak out. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Second, on nomina-
tions, the Senate is once again making 
excellent 
progress 
this 
week 
con-
firming President Biden’s nominees. 
We began the week by confirming a 
history-making Cabinet member, Inte-
rior Secretary Haaland. Yesterday, we 
confirmed Isabel Guzman as the SBA 
Administrator. Today, we will confirm 
another consequential administrative 
appointment, the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative. 
President Biden has named Katherine 
Tai, the daughter of proud immigrants 
from Taiwan, a veteran of the Office of 
the Trade Representative under Presi-
dent Obama, and one of our country’s 
most seasoned experts in international 
trade. That—Ms. Tai—is what America 
is all about. 
We welcome her. We give her a great 
position of authority because of her ex-
pertise. And maybe—you know, I will 
leave it at that. It is a great contrast 
to the tragedy I was talking about a 
few minutes ago and the ascension of 
another proud American of Asian an-
cestry here. 
As U.S. Trade Representative, Ms. 
Tai will play a crucial role in enforcing 
existing trade deals and making sure 
that American workers, businesses, 
and researchers can compete on a level 
playing field. She will be an essential 
player in restoring America’s credi-
bility with our trading partners and 
promoting international cooperation to 
tackle some of the world’s biggest 
problems, from the global pandemic to 
climate change. 
I have not a single doubt that Ms. Tai 
is the right person for the job, and I 
look forward to the Senate giving her a 
well-deserved promotion later today. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now on S. 1, democ-
racy reform, today Senate Democrats 
are introducing the No. 1 bill of the 
117th Congress, S. 1, to stand up to 
voter suppression, end dark money in 
politics, and reinvigorate American de-
mocracy in the 21st century. 
Make no mistake, democracy reform 
must be a top priority of this Congress, 
and I will put S. 1, the For the People 
Act, on the floor of the Senate. 
For too long, we have let really im-
portant parts of our democracy wither. 
Unlimited dark money flows into cam-
paigns. Special interests have way too 
much influence in Washington. And 
worst of all, there is a concerted, na-
tionwide effort to limit the right of 
American citizens, particularly people 
of color, to vote. 
Throughout America’s history, we 
have seen a continuous cycle of expan-
sions in our democracy being met all 
too often by vehement backlash from 
those who wish to maintain an exclu-
sionary status quo. 
Earlier this year, we witnessed only 
the latest example in the form of a vio-
lent insurrection right here in this 
Chamber, right here in this Capitol, an 
attack fueled by the insidious lies of 
the former President aimed at over-
turning the results of a free and fair 
election. 
In the wake of the November elec-
tion, one of the safest and most secure 
in American history, dozens of Repub-
lican-led State legislatures have seized 
on the former President’s big lie and 
introduced hundreds of bills aimed at 
tightening voting rules under the nasty 
guise—the nasty, malicious, and false 
guise—of 
election 
integrity. 
These 
bills, sadly, are aimed at Americans of 
color—Black Americans, Latinos, Na-
tive Americans. 
Despicable efforts to target these his-
torically disenfranchised communities 
have become a central component of 
the electoral strategy of one of Amer-
ica’s major political parties. Shame on 
them. Shame. It is infuriating. Infuri-
ating. When you lose an election, you 
are supposed to win over the people 
you lost, not stop them from voting. 
That is un-American, autocratic, and 
against the fundamentals of our de-
mocracy, but this is happening in 
States 
all 
across 
the 
country—all 
across the country. 
Maybe the most reprehensible effort 
is underway in Georgia, where State 
Republicans are trying to limit absen-
tee and mail-in voting, make it harder 
to post a ballot by drop box, and dis-
allowing early voting on Sunday, a day 
when many churchgoing African Amer-
icans participate in voter drives. Does 
anyone on the other side of the aisle 
think taking away Sunday voting in 
Georgia is not bigoted? What is the ra-
tionale? Stop it, if you want to stand 
for equality and justice. 
Our country has supposedly come a 
long way since African Americans in 
the South were forced to guess the 
number of jellybeans in a jar in order 
to vote. But some of these voter sup-
pression laws in Georgia and other Re-
publican States smack of Jim Crow in 
the 21st century rearing its ugly head 
once again. 
These laws and their various cousins 
in Republican State legislatures across 
the country are collectively one of the 
greatest threats to modern American 
democracy. According to a recent re-
port in the Washington Post, these 
laws could strain every available meth-
od of voting for tens of millions of 
Americans, potentially amounting to 
the most sweeping contraction of bal-
lot access in the United States since 
the 
end 
of 
Reconstruction, 
when 
Southern States curtailed the voting 
rights of formerly enslaved Black men. 
If one party believes ‘‘heads we win; 
tails you cheated’’; if one political 
party believes that when you lose an 
election, the answer isn’t to win more 
votes but, rather, to prevent the other 
side from voting, then we have serious 
and existential threats to our democ-
racy on our hands. 
This is no political dispute. It goes 
way beyond that to the core—the 
core—of what America is all about. 
That is why we need S. 1 so badly, a 
bill that would combat all of these 
voter suppression efforts by restoring 
critical parts of the Voting Rights Act; 
a bill that would make it easier, not 
harder, to vote by automatically reg-
istering American voters when they 
get a driver’s license; a bill that would 
limit dark money and corruption in 
our politics and much more. 
There are a lot of problems in our 
country—healthcare 
and 
climate 
change and income inequality—but we 
designed a democracy that would allow 
competing interests in our country to 
come together and agree on solutions. 
If our democracy doesn’t work, we have 
no hope of solving any of our other 
problems. 
S. 1 is going to be a top priority this 
Congress. We will fight and fight and 
fight to get this done legislatively. 
Failure is not an option. Too darn 
much is at stake. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now on the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, I would like to con-
tinue shining a spotlight on different 
aspects of ARP. The legislation helped 
so many people and so much of the 
country, it is easy to forget many cru-
cial parts of the bill. So later today, I 
will be joining my dear friend Rep-
resentative VELA´ ZQUEZ from New York 
to talk about how the American Res-
cue Plan helps Puerto Rico, which is 
too often an afterthought in Federal 
legislation. 
The American Rescue Plan will do 
three historic things for the people of 
Puerto Rico, American citizens all. 
First, it will deliver Federal dollars 
to the island’s earned income tax cred-
it for low-wage workers for the first 
time ever.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1579 
March 17, 2021 
Second, it will expand eligibility for 
residents to claim the child tax credit. 
Prior to the ARP, only families with 
three or more children in Puerto Rico 
could claim the child tax credit. Why 
those American citizens were treated 
differently than all the others was be-
yond me and strikes me as nasty. But 
now every family can. 
Third, the ARP bill will add $1 bil-
lion—$1 billion—in food assistance. 
Residents of American territories don’t 
receive traditional food assistance pro-
grams like those in the United States, 
such as the SNAP program, but instead 
their governments receive block grants 
that have been capped by the Federal 
Government. 
The American Rescue Plan makes 
sure that Puerto Rico, which suffers 
devastating rates of poverty, 43 per-
cent, and especially childhood pov-
erty—an unacceptable 57 percent of all 
the children in Puerto Rico live in pov-
erty. So we want to make sure that 
Puerto Rico receives its fair share of 
Federal food assistance. 
The American Rescue Plan may be 
the greatest anti-poverty effort in a 
generation, and we make sure that 
Puerto Rico is part of it. 
Now let me turn my attention to 
schools. One of most enduring images 
of the COVID–19 pandemic will be the 
empty 
classroom. 
For 
12 
months, 
teachers have done their level best to 
keep their students engaged with re-
mote learning, but there have been in-
credible difficulties. Too many stu-
dents don’t have reliable internet. Too 
many parents can’t be there to help 
young kids log on and keep up with 
their work. Simply put, there is no re-
placement for having kids in the class-
room. We need to get our schools to re-
open as quickly and as safely as pos-
sible. 
Now, my Republican colleagues have 
made a lot of noise about reopening our 
schools, but they don’t want to dedi-
cate any resources to actually getting 
it done. We need money to do this. 
There are many more expenses under 
COVID. 
Through the American Rescue Plan, 
Senate Democrats delivered the single 
largest investment in American edu-
cation ever. We are proud of that. 
Proud. Let me say it again. Through 
the American Rescue Plan, Senate 
Democrats delivered the single largest 
investment 
in 
American 
education 
ever—ever—$170 billion to repair the 
damage 
caused 
by 
this 
pandemic, 
three-quarters of which will go directly 
to K–12 education, prioritizing school 
districts that need it the most. This 
will help schools update ventilation, 
hire more nurses and janitors, make 
classroom sizes smaller, and make get-
ting kids to and from school safe. 
In short, the American Rescue Plan 
will greatly accelerate the safe and ef-
fective reopening of schools. Once kids 
are back in the classroom, the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan will help make sure 
they can stay there and succeed. After 
what has been a lost year for too many 
students, this bill provides significant 
support for learning recovery pro-
grams—afterschool programs, summer 
school programs, and other resources 
to help kids catch up and get back on 
track. 
Through the American Rescue Plan, 
we have made a life-changing invest-
ment in our students. It is one of the 
many ways this bill will help us re-
cover from the crisis and come back 
stronger than ever before. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Last week, our 
Democratic colleagues had to resort to 
a rare tactic to rescue the stalled nom-
ination of Xavier Becerra to run the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
The distinguishing feature of this 
nominee’s resume is not his expertise 
in health, medicine, or administration. 
That part of the resume is very brief. 
What stands out are Mr. Becerra’s com-
mitments to partisan warfare and his 
far-left ideology. 
He has supported the sweeping gov-
ernment takeover of healthcare they 
call ‘‘Medicare for All,’’ which would 
actually end Medicare as we know it 
and would rip away families’ private 
insurance plans. 
As the administration’s policies con-
tinue to create a border crisis, Mr. 
Becerra is someone who believes we 
should not just have blanket amnesty, 
but that entering the country illegally 
should not even be a crime. 
And even amid a global pandemic, 
the most significant health-related ex-
perience on the nominee’s record is his 
efforts to wield the legal system 
against religious Sisters to make them 
violate their faith and conscience. 
Up to now, every person who has ever 
been confirmed as Secretary of Health 
and Human Services has either been fa-
vorably reported by the Finance Com-
mittee or discharged by unanimous 
consent. There is ample reason why 
this nominee would be a glaring excep-
tion. 
I continue to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
f 
NOMINATION OF KATHERINE C. 
TAI 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
fortunately, the Senate will first be 
confirming 
a 
thoroughly 
qualified 
nominee to be the new administra-
tion’s top trade official. 
Katherine Tai is just the kind of 
qualified and mainstream person who 
is positioned to serve President Biden 
and the country quite well. That is why 
she received broad bipartisan support 
from the Finance Committee and why 
the vote to advance her nomination 
yesterday was 98 to 0. 
I look forward to working with Ms. 
Tai to embrace trade and push back on 
abusive practices from China and other 
anticompetitive countries. 
Trade is a huge strength of America. 
It drives job creation and economic 
growth. Just look at my home State, 
for example. Exports support more 
than 140,000 jobs in Kentucky. Hard- 
working Kentuckians supply nearly 200 
countries with everything from agri-
cultural goods to medicines, to aero-
space parts and motor vehicles. 
In the last Congress, we modernized 
our trade with our neighbors to the 
north and south through the USMCA. 
We gave Kentucky farmers, workers, 
and consumers a long-awaited boost. 
But our job creators still face unfair 
barriers, 
including 
those 
targeting 
American spirits. The Bluegrass is 
proud to craft 95 percent of the world’s 
bourbon, but, currently, tariffs put 
Kentucky distillers at a disadvantage 
in their largest export markets. 
Ms. Tai should address these unfair 
international headwinds facing Ken-
tuckians. I would encourage her to 
focus on expanding markets and reduc-
ing barriers for products and services 
from all 50 States. 
Americans 
would 
welcome 
the 
growth in opportunity and prosperity. 
And, if you ask me, the whole world 
could benefit from a little more Ken-
tucky bourbon. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
tomorrow, the Secretary of State and 
the President’s National Security Ad-
visor will have their first face-to-face 
meeting with Chinese officials. I am 
glad our officials met with regional al-
lies like Japan and South Korea right 
beforehand and have been in touch 
with Australia and European allies as 
well. It is essential that we and our 
friends present a united front. 
Now, the United States and the whole 
world need the President’s team to de-
liver a strong message tomorrow. 
During 
the 
campaign, 
President 
Biden spoke dismissively about the 
threat from China. But thus far, in of-
fice, his team has shown signs they un-
derstand 
that 
Communist 
China 
threatens America, our allies, and the 
prevailing international system. 
The world spent years presuming 
that welcoming China into the inter-
national community would inevitably 
cause its rulers to play by the rules. 
Twenty years ago, President Clinton 
said: ‘‘[E]conomic innovation and po-
litical empowerment . . . will inevi-
tably go hand in hand.’’ But since then, 
rather than the rest of the world ex-
porting liberty and transparency into 
China, Beijing has found more success 
exporting authoritarianism and corrup-
tion beyond its borders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1580 
March 17, 2021 
In Japan, on Tuesday, Secretary 
Blinken called out the ‘‘coercion and 
aggression’’ that China deploys at 
home and abroad. He said this adminis-
tration will push back on Beijing. That 
clear-eyed talk is certainly welcome, 
but it is just the first step. 
Walking the walk will mean actually 
responding in tough ways to espionage 
and cyber attacks, to violations of 
human rights, to military bullying, to 
stealing 
intellectual 
property 
and 
cheating on trade. If the administra-
tion is up to the task, they will find 
strong partners in this Republican con-
ference. 
Here is one big test: Are they willing 
to keep investing in our own defense? 
Our financial commitment to defend-
ing America is our most important pol-
icy lever in this competition with 
China. Our allies and adversaries do 
not heed American Presidents because 
they are charming or good-looking. 
The world has respected America for 
our overwhelming military and eco-
nomic superiority. When that edge 
erodes, we invite trouble. 
As a share of our economy, American 
defense spending has fallen signifi-
cantly, not just from Cold War-era 
heights but even just recently. Mean-
while, China used its growing pros-
perity to modernize its military, de-
velop new and longer range weapons to 
hold U.S. forces at risk from further 
away, and turn a particular eye to-
wards space and cyber space. 
Defense spending is about protecting 
our homeland. It is about projecting 
power. It is about preserving global in-
fluence, supporting our allies. It is 
really a barometer of our national will. 
It is also about innovation and the 
future. Many life-changing innovations 
throughout our economy were first 
rooted in military R&D. 
Unfortunately, reports suggest the 
Biden administration may plan to 
freeze defense spending. Of course, that 
means a reduction, after inflation. Doz-
ens of Democrats are pressuring the ad-
ministration for even steeper cuts than 
that. If the administration is serious 
about competing with China, deterring 
Russia, and preserving American lead-
ership, the most important test will be 
in the President’s budget submission. 
Some of our Senate Democratic col-
leagues have expressed interest in 
crafting bipartisan legislation related 
to China. If any issue is ripe for a reg-
ular-order, bipartisan process, it would 
be that one. 
Defense spending is the crucial first 
step, but there are a whole variety of 
subjects concerning our competition 
with China that could benefit from a 
serious look. 
There is bipartisan support for im-
proving security reviews of foreign in-
vestment and protecting against forced 
technology transfer, for cracking down 
on Chinese espionage and political in-
fluence campaigns, for supporting the 
people of Hong Kong, and human 
rights, 
and 
deterring 
aggression 
against Taiwan. There is bipartisan 
support for fostering specific industries 
of national-security importance, such 
as semiconductors, and for broadly 
strengthening American R&D. 
There is an opportunity for fruitful 
discussion here. Certainly, this is an 
area where bipartisanship will be espe-
cially 
crucial, 
so 
strategies 
don’t 
change schizophrenically with every 
election. As one of our Democratic col-
leagues said in a hearing yesterday, 
‘‘the U.S. will not out-compete China 
. . . with short-term legislation and 
never-ending uncertainty.’’ 
That is another great argument for 
not trashing the legislative filibuster. 
Imagine if every action the Senate 
takes with national security implica-
tions were constantly subject to being 
wiped clean. While China plans years 
and decades at a time, our Federal leg-
islation would be reduced to a shelf life 
of a couple years. 
These issues need to be addressed 
thoughtfully and deliberately. Identi-
fying critical technologies and the best 
ways to promote and protect advance-
ments needs to be a smart, fact-based 
process, not a political guessing game 
or throwing cash at industries with the 
right connections. 
Our 
work 
on 
this 
front 
should 
strengthen our ties with our allies and 
partners, not try in vain to simply go 
it alone. 
And the Democratic majority must 
resist the temptation to pile a long list 
of unrelated policy wishes into a big 
package and try to label it ‘‘China pol-
icy.’’ It would be quite a remarkable 
coincidence if our Democratic col-
leagues’ vision for a so-called China 
bill ends up being indistinguishable 
from a list of things that just happen 
to delight liberal interest groups. 
Getting America on a stronger foot-
ing will not require some sweeping far- 
left transformation of our economy. It 
will mean continuing to complement 
the principles and ideas that are our 
greatest strengths, and it will mean 
working on these issues the right way, 
across the aisle.

TRIBUTE TO ERIC FELDMAN 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to an extraor-
dinary public servant and Michigander, 
Eric Feldman. 
Since my first days serving in the 
U.S. House of Representatives more 
than 12 years ago, Eric has served as 
my chief of staff. I still vividly remem-
ber him coming to my home just a cou-
ple of weeks after my election to inter-
view for the chief of staff position. 
I was immediately impressed by his 
extensive knowledge of American poli-
tics and his passion to serve the people 
of the State of Michigan. 
But to fully know Eric is to know his 
family’s story and how it shaped the 
man he is. All four of his grandparents 
survived the Holocaust. His maternal 
grandmother was imprisoned in Ausch-
witz and Bergen-Belsen, among others. 
His maternal grandfather was in a 
forced labor camp in Plaszow. His 
grandparents met and married in the 
Bergen-Belsen 
concentration 
camp. 
They were liberated from there and re-
mained after it was converted to a dis-
placed persons camp following World 
War II. That camp is where Eric’s 
mother was born. 
His grandparents and mother immi-
grated in 1949 to Detroit, where his 
grandfather worked as a janitor at 
Ford Motor Company during the day 
and worked as a tailor at night. His 
mother won a full scholarship to the 
University of Michigan from Ford 
Motor Company as part of a program 
for employees. 
Eric’s paternal grandparents fled Po-
land on the eve of the Nazi German in-
vasion. They survived the war as slave 
laborers in Siberia, where Eric’s father 
was born. Following the war, they im-
migrated to Israel before settling in 
Detroit. Eric’s father went to Wayne 
State University, thanks to the GI bill, 
after serving honorably in the U.S. Air 
Force. 
After immigrating to Detroit, Eric’s 
family worked hard, and they were able 
to achieve the American dream. There 
is no question that their life experience 
and their journey instilled in Eric a 
sense of service and devotion to coun-
try. 
As a freshman Member of Congress, I 
was fortunate to have Eric on my 
team. He brought with him extensive 
political and policy experience, having 
worked 
for 
Congresswoman 
NITA 
LOWEY, Leader NANCY
PELOSI, and 
Rahm Emanuel. He built on that expe-
rience, leading our office with steady, 
unwavering leadership, brilliant vision, 
and wise counsel. 
Through four reelections—including 
my election to the Senate and reelec-
tion last year—and many crises im-
pacting Michigan and our country, I

sure that we were on the leading edge 
of issues critical to Michigan. 
He has guided my office through 
countless high-profile events and cri-
ses: the great recession and auto crisis, 
the Flint water crisis, several govern-
ment shutdowns, the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the January 6 attack on the 
U.S. Capitol, and two impeachment 
trials. Through it all, Eric has provided 
stability and focus—a focus on working 
in a bipartisan manner to pass impor-
tant legislation and to make progress 
for Michigan and for our entire coun-
try. 
Last week, I was humbled to be rec-
ognized by the Center for Effective 
Lawmaking as the most effective Sen-
ator in the 116th Congress. Recognition 
of this sort does not happen without 
having an incredible team. Eric played 
a critical role in helping me enact 10 
bills into law—the most of any Senator 
from either party over the last 2 years. 
And I know that Eric will tell you, 
without a doubt, that there is no ‘‘I’’ in 
team. As a leader, Eric has focused on 
hiring talented staff, both in DC and 
across Michigan, staff that humbly, 
selflessly, and effectively serve the 
people of Michigan each and every day. 
With Eric’s laser focus on what is best 
for Michigan, together with our team, 
we have secured record funding to pro-
tect the Great Lakes, worked to in-
crease security at our Nation’s borders, 
expanded apprenticeships and skills 
training, saved taxpayer dollars, and 
made the Federal Government more ef-
ficient, all the while standing up for 
Michigan 
workers, 
including 
those 
working in our auto industry. 
Eric is always on the leading edge, 
and 
he 
has 
distinguished 
himself 
through his work with Michigan’s auto 
manufacturers and automotive stake-
holders. In particular, Eric has helped 
drive policy efforts focused on innova-
tion and emerging technologies so that 
in the near future, self-driving vehicles 
will not only be safely deployed and 
save thousands of lives on our high-
ways but also be developed and built in 
Michigan and in the United States, cre-
ating good-paying jobs for the next 
generation of workers. 
At every step of the way, through all 
of his hard work, Eric has carried him-
self with his characteristic enthusiasm 
and passion. It is only fitting, as an 
alum of the University of Michigan and 
a fervent—very fervent—Wolverine fan, 
he has, and I quote, an ‘‘enthusiasm 
unknown to mankind.’’ Whether it is 
policy, politics, casework, or an issue 
important to constituents, there is no 
doubt that Eric approaches it with 
keen interest and with high energy and 
that he will think through every single 
possible angle. 
But Eric has been much more than 
just a chief aide. Colleen and I feel in-
credibly fortunate not only for all that 
Eric has done to lead my office and de-
liver for the people of Michigan; we 
count on him as a confidant and a dear 
friend. 
Eric, you will be missed dearly as 
you depart for your next endeavor in 
the private sector. But I am grateful 
for what you have built, and I know 
that it will endure—a culture of team-
work, hard work, productivity, and a 
commitment 
to 
what 
is 
best 
for 
Michiganders. 
Eric, Colleen and I know that you 
have devoted countless hours to a job 
that you love while balancing the two 
most important roles in your life: 
being a loving husband and a father. I 
have been proud to watch you celebrate 
many of life’s milestones over the 
years, including the birth of your two 
beloved sons, and I will certainly never 
forget your eldest son Avi’s birthday 
on 
November 
4, 
2014, 
the 
day 
Michiganders elected me to the U.S. 
Senate. 
Eric, Colleen and I wish you much 
success, and we hope you enjoy this 
next chapter with Dena, Avi, and 
Ethan. Know that Colleen and I will al-
ways be thankful beyond measure for 
your service and for your leadership 
and that you will forever be part of 
Team PETERS.

GEORGIA SHOOTING 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
would like to start by taking a mo-
ment to address the awful violence we 
saw in Georgia yesterday. 
Everyone, especially elected officials, 
needs to not just speak out but to act 
against this deadly display of hate. 
To the victims and their families and 
to the Asian-American and Pacific-Is-
lander community in Washington State 
and nationwide, my heart is with you 
not just today but going forward. I will 
continue sending a strong message that 
hate against you must stop, and I will 
keep working to ensure your safety in 
light of the terrible surge in hate 
crimes we have seen in our State and 
across the country. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Now, Madam President, I rise today 
to voice my strong support for Attor-
ney General Becerra to serve as Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services. 
After 4 years of attacks on families’ 
healthcare 
from 
President 
Trump, 
after a year of this pandemic ravaging 
our Nation, the challenges that lie 
ahead of us, especially when it comes 
to healthcare, are numerous; they are 
enormous; and they are absolutely ur-
gent. 
The uninsured rate, the drug prices, 
and healthcare costs have all sky-
rocketed. Confidence in our public 
health agencies have plummeted. Al-
ready painful health inequities have 
grown deeper. And this pandemic has 
absolutely 
devastated 
communities 
and pushed our healthcare system to 
the brink. 
COVID–19 has killed over a half a 
million people, and that number con-
tinues to rise. When it comes to the 
hard work ahead to not only end this 
pandemic but rebuild a stronger and 
fairer country, it is clear we need an 
experienced leader at the Department 
of Health and Human Services. It is 
clear we don’t have a second to waste, 
and 
it 
is 
clear 
Attorney 
General 
Becerra is the right pick for this job. 
His track record shows he has the 
convictions and the qualifications for 
the task at hand. As a Member of Con-
gress for over two decades, he has prov-
en himself a skilled legislator who un-
derstands healthcare policy. As attor-
ney general of one of the Nation’s larg-
est justice departments, he has proven 
himself as a leader capable of heading 
a complex Department like HHS. And 
throughout all of his work, he has 
proven himself as a champion for pa-
tients and public health. 
In Congress, he worked to help more 
people 
get 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare by passing the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program and the Af-
fordable Care Act. In California, he has 
fought in court to defend the Afford-
able Care Act and time and time again 
has gone to court to fight for patients, 
like when he won a $70 million settle-
ment from pharmaceutical companies 
for blocking cheaper generic drugs 
from market, when he won a settle-
ment from opioid manufacturers be-
hind the addiction crisis and joined a 
bipartisan investigation into whether 
opioids 
were 
unlawfully 
marketed, 
when he sued e-cigarette companies 
from marketing tobacco products to 
children and led a bipartisan effort 
with the Republican attorney general 
of Nebraska to protect kids from to-
bacco imagery, or when he worked to 
investigate companies and hold them 
accountable for putting workers at risk 
by failing to follow COVID–19 safety 
measures. 
Attorney General Becerra has also 
worked to acknowledge and address 
issues driving inequities in healthcare. 
As leader of California’s Department of 
Justice, he fought in court against the 
Trump administration rule that under-
mined care for the LGBTQ community, 
against the administration’s constant 
efforts 
to 
undermine 
reproductive 
healthcare and against its blatant dis-
regard for the well-being of migrant 
children. 
Attorney General Becerra also estab-
lished a new Bureau of Disability

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1582 
March 17, 2021 
Rights at his department, as well as a 
new office focused on environmental 
justice, including how pollution and 
public health hazards disproportion-
ately hurt communities of color. 
Overall, his record tells a story that 
is clear, compelling, and persuasive. He 
has 
fought 
against 
pharmaceutical 
companies, opioid manufacturers, to-
bacco companies and polluters and for 
more affordable, quality healthcare for 
every patient. 
I have no doubt as Secretary that he 
will put special interests on notice and 
put patients and public health first and 
put science, data, and experts back in 
the driver’s seat. And he would also 
bring an important perspective to this 
role as a first-generation college stu-
dent and the first Latino Secretary of 
Health and Human Services. 
He is exactly the kind of leader we 
need to make sure we make good on 
the promise of the historic investments 
we made in the American Rescue Plan 
to end this pandemic—investments to 
rapidly scale up testing and tracing 
and sequencing so we can identify new 
strains of COVID and slow the spread; 
investments to quickly and equitably 
get vaccines into arms, an effort that 
requires not just making vaccines 
available but breaking down barriers to 
access, promoting vaccine confidence, 
fighting misinformation, and engaging 
community partners; investments to 
build our public health infrastructure 
and recruit and train 100,000 public 
healthcare workers. 
He will also be a valuable partner to 
Congress as we work to address chal-
lenges that predate this pandemic but 
have been made all the more urgent, 
like rooting out systemic racism and 
addressing inequities in our healthcare 
system, which have made this pan-
demic so much more damaging and 
deadly for communities of color; like 
addressing the mental healthcare cri-
sis, which the trauma of this pandemic 
has made so much worse; like fighting 
the opioid epidemic, a crisis which was 
deadlier than ever this past year; and 
like expanding access to quality afford-
able childcare, which has become more 
difficult for families to get during this 
pandemic. 
When this pandemic is over, we will 
need a strong leader at the Department 
to deal with the aftermath and with so 
many other outstanding issues: bring-
ing down prescription drugs prices; 
making sure healthcare in this country 
is truly a right, not a privilege; 
undoing 4 years of attacks on reproduc-
tive rights and ensuring every woman 
can get reproductive healthcare, re-
gardless of their race or income or ZIP 
Code or disability; lowering our uncon-
scionably 
high 
maternal 
mortality 
rate; reversing the alarming trend of 
rising youth tobacco use; and ensuring 
the Office of Refugee Resettlement is 
upholding 
its 
welfare 
mission 
by 
prioritizing the well-being of every 
child in its care, ensuring they are 
treated with decency and humanity 
and kindness; and working to place 
children with suitable sponsors quickly 
and safely. 
We have our work cut out for us, but 
in Attorney General Becerra, we have a 
Secretary of Health who is up to the 
job. He has the support not only of 
Democrats but of Republicans, as the 
Republican attorneys general of both 
Louisiana and Tennessee have spoken 
highly of their experiences working 
with him. 
I urge every Senator who wants the 
Biden-Harris administration to succeed 
at ending this pandemic quickly, keep-
ing our families safe, and ensuring ev-
eryone 
can 
get 
quality 
affordable 
healthcare to join me in voting to con-
firm him. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

MAIDEN SPEECH 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, before 
I begin my formal remarks, I want to 
pause to condemn the hatred and vio-
lence that took eight precious lives 
last night in Metropolitan Atlanta. 
I agree with Georgians, with Ameri-
cans, with people of love all across the 
world. This unspeakable violence vis-
ited largely upon the Asian community 
is one that causes all of us to recommit 
ourselves to the way of peace, an active 
peace that prevents these kinds of 
tragedies from happening in the first 
place. 
We pray for these families. 
Mr. President, I rise here today, as a 
proud American and as one of the new-
est Members of the Senate, in awe of 
the journey that has brought me to 
these hallowed Halls and with an abid-
ing sense of reverence and gratitude for 
the faith and sacrifices of ancestors 
who paved the way. 
I am a proud son of the great State of 
Georgia, born and raised in Savannah, 
a coastal city known for its cobble-
stone streets and verdant town squares. 
Towering oak trees, centuries old and 
covered 
in 
gray 
Spanish 
moss, 
stretched from one side of the street to 
the other, bend and beckon the lover of 
history and horticulture to this city by 
the sea. 
I was educated at Morehouse College, 
and I still serve in the pulpit of the 
Ebenezer Baptist Church, both in At-
lanta, the cradle of the civil rights 
movement. And so like those oak trees 
in Savannah, my roots go down deep, 
and they stretch wide in the soil of 
Waycross, GA, and Burke County, and 
Screven County. In a word, I am Geor-
gia, a living example and embodiment 
of its history and its hope, of its pain 
and promise, the brutality and possi-
bility. 
At the time of my birth, Georgia’s 
two Senators were Richard B. Russell 
and Herman E. Talmadge, both arch 
segregationists and unabashed adver-
saries of the civil rights movement. 
After the Supreme Court’s landmark 
Brown 
v. 
Board 
ruling 
outlawing 
school segregation, Talmadge warned 
that ‘‘blood will run in the streets of 
Atlanta.’’ 
Senator Talmadge’s father, Eugene 
Talmadge, former Governor of our 
State, had famously declared: ‘‘The 
South loves the Negro in his place, but 
his place is at the back door.’’ 
When once asked how he and his sup-
porters might keep Black people away 
from the polls, he picked up a scrap of 
paper and wrote a single word on it: 
‘‘Pistols.’’ 
Yet there is something in the Amer-
ican covenant, in its charter docu-
ments and its Jeffersonian ideals, that 
bends toward freedom. And led by a 
preacher and a patriot named King, 
Americans of all races stood up. His-
tory vindicated the movement that 
sought to bring us closer to our ideals, 
to lengthen and strengthen the cords of 
our democracy, and I now hold the 
seat—the Senate seat—where Herman 
E. Talmadge sat. 
That is why I love America. I love 
America because we always have a 
path to make it better, to build a more 
perfect Union. It is the place where a 
kid like me, who grew up in public 
housing, the first college graduate in 
my family, can now stand as a United 
States Senator. 
I had an older father. He was born in 
1917. Serving in the Army during World 
War II, he was once asked to give up 
his seat to a young teenager while 
wearing his soldier’s uniform, as they 
said, ‘‘making the world safe for de-
mocracy.’’ But he was never bitter. By 
the time I came along, he had already 
seen the arc of change in our country. 
He maintained his faith in God and in 
his family and in the American prom-
ise, and he passed that faith on to his 
children. 
My mother grew up in Waycross, GA. 
Do you know where that is? It is way 
’cross Georgia. Like a lot of Black 
teenagers in the 1950s, she spent her 
summers picking somebody else’s to-
bacco and somebody else’s cotton. But 
because this is America, the 82-year-old 
hands that used to pick somebody 
else’s cotton went to the polls in Janu-
ary and picked her youngest son to be 
a United States Senator. Ours is a land 
where possibility is born of democracy: 
a vote, a voice, a chance to help deter-
mine the direction of the country and 
one’s own destiny within it—possibility 
born of democracy. 
That is why this past November and 
January, my mom and other citizens of 
Georgia grabbed hold of that possi-
bility and turned out in record num-
bers, 5 million in November, 4.5 million 
in January—far more than ever in our 
State’s history. Turnout for a typical 
runoff doubled, and the people of Geor-
gia sent their first African-American 
Senator and first Jewish Senator, my 
brother JON OSSOFF, to these hallowed 
Halls. 
But then, what happened? Some poli-
ticians did not approve of the choice 
made by the majority of voters in a 
hard-fought election in which each side 
got the chance to make its case to the 
voters. And rather than adjusting their 
agenda, rather than changing their 
message, they are busy trying to 
change the rules. We are witnessing 
right now a massive and unabashed as-
sault on voting rights, unlike anything 
we have ever seen since the Jim Crow 
era. This is Jim Crow with new clothes. 
Since the January election, some 250 
voter suppression bills have been intro-
duced by State legislatures all across 
the country, from Georgia to Arizona, 
from New Hampshire to Florida, using 
the big lie of voter fraud as a pretext 
for voter suppression—the same big lie 
that led to a violent insurrection on 
this very Capitol the day after my elec-
tion. Within 24 hours, we elected Geor-
gia’s first African-American and Jew-
ish Senators, and hours later the Cap-
itol was assaulted. You see in just a 
few precious hours the tension very 
much alive in the soul of America. The 
question before all of us at every mo-
ment is, What will we do to push us in 
the right direction? 
So politicians, driven by that big lie, 
aim to severely limit and in some cases 
eliminate 
automatic 
and 
same-day 
voter registration, mail-in and absen-
tee voting, and early voting and week-
end voting. They want to make it easi-
er to purge voters from the voting roll 
altogether. As a voting rights activist, 
I have seen up close just how draconian 
these measures can be. I hail from a 
State that purged 200,000 voters from 
the rolls one Saturday night in the 
middle of the night. We know what is 
happening here. Some people don’t 
want some people to vote. 
I was honored on a few occasions to 
stand with our hero and my parish-
ioner, John Lewis. I was his pastor, but 
I am clear: He was my mentor. On 
more than one occasion, we boarded 
buses together after Sunday church 
services as part of our Souls to the 
Polls program, encouraging the Ebe-
nezer Church family and other commu-
nities of faith to participate in the 
democratic process. Now, just a few 
months 
after 
Congressman 
Lewis’s 
death, there are those in the Georgia 
legislature—some who even dared to 
praise his name—that are now trying 
to get rid of Sunday Souls to the Polls, 
making it a crime for people who pray 
together to get on a bus together in 
order to vote together. I think that is 
wrong. As a matter of fact, I think that 
a vote is a kind of prayer for the kind 
of world we desire for ourselves and for 
our children, and our prayers are 
stronger when we pray together. 
To be sure, we have seen these kinds 
of voter suppression tactics before. 
They are part of a long and shameful 
history in Georgia and throughout our 
Nation. But refusing to be denied, 
Georgia citizens and citizens across our 
country braved the heat and the cold 
and the rain, some standing in line for 
5 hours, 6 hours, 10 hours just to exer-
cise their constitutional right to vote— 
young people, old people, sick people, 
working people already underpaid and 
forced to lose wages to pay a kind of

poll tax while standing in line to vote. 
And how do some politicians respond? 
Well, they are trying to make it a 
crime to give people water and a snack 
as they wait in lines that are obviously 
being made longer by their draconian 
actions. 
Think about that. Think about that. 
They are the ones making the lines 
longer through these draconian ac-
tions. And then they want to make it a 
crime to bring grandma some water 
while she is waiting in a line that they 
are making longer. Make no mistake, 
this is democracy in reverse. Rather 
than voters being able to pick the poli-
ticians, the politicians are trying to 
cherry-pick their voters. I say this can-
not stand. 
And so I rise, Mr. President, because 
that sacred and noble idea—one person, 
one vote—is being threatened right 
now. Politicians in my home State and 
all across America, in their craven lust 
for power, have launched a full-fledged 
assault on voting rights. They are fo-
cused on winning at any cost, even the 
cost of democracy itself. I submit that 
it is the job of each citizen to stand up 
for the voting rights of every citizen. 
And it is the job of this body to do all 
that it can to defend the viability of 
our democracy. 
That is why I am a proud cosponsor 
of the For the People Act, which we in-
troduced today. The For the People 
Act is a major step in the march to-
ward our Democratic ideals, making it 
easier, not harder, for eligible Ameri-
cans to vote by instituting common-
sense, pro-democracy reforms, like es-
tablishing national automatic voter 
registration for every eligible citizen 
and allowing all Americans to register 
to vote online and on election day; re-
quiring States to offer at least 2 weeks 
of early voting, including weekends, in 
Federal elections, keeping Souls to the 
Polls 
programs 
alive; 
prohibiting 
States from restricting a person’s abil-
ity to vote absentee or by mail; and 
preventing States from purging the 
voting rolls based solely on unreliable 
evidence like someone’s voting history, 
something we have seen in Georgia and 
other States in recent years. And it 
would end the dominance of Big Money 
in our politics and ensure our public 
servants are there serving the public. 
Amidst these voter suppression laws 
and tactics, including partisan and ra-
cial gerrymandering, and in a system 
awash in dark money and the domi-
nance of corporate interests and politi-
cians who do their bidding, the voices 
of the American people have been in-
creasingly drowned out and crowded 
out and squeezed out of their own de-
mocracy. We must pass For the People 
so that the people might have a voice. 
Your vote is your voice, and your voice 
is your human dignity. But not only 
that, we must pass the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. 
You know, voting rights used to be a 
bipartisan issue. The last time the vot-
ing rights bill was reauthorized was 
2006. George W. Bush was President, 
and it passed this Chamber 98 to 0. But 
then, in its 2013 decision, the Supreme 
Court rejected the successful formula 
for supervision and preclearance con-
tained in the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 
They asked Congress to fix it. That was 
nearly 8 years ago, and the American 
people are still waiting. Stripped of 
protections, voters in States with a 
long history of voter discrimination 
and voters in many other States have 
been thrown to the winds. 
We Americans have noisy and spir-
ited debates about many things, and we 
should. That is what it means to live in 
a free country. But access to the ballot 
ought to be nonpartisan. I submit that 
there should be 100 votes in this Cham-
ber for policies that will make it easier 
for Americans to make their voices 
heard in our democracy. Surely, there 
ought to be at least 60 in this Chamber 
who believe, as I do, that the four most 
powerful words uttered in a democracy 
are ‘‘the people have spoken’’; there-
fore, we must ensure that all of the 
people can speak. 
But if not, we must still pass voting 
rights. The right to vote is preserva-
tive of all other rights. It is not just 
another issue alongside other issues. It 
is foundational. It is the reason why 
any of us have the privilege of standing 
here in the first place. It is about the 
covenant we have with one another as 
an 
American 
people: 
‘‘e 
pluribus 
unum,’’ out of many, one. It, above all 
else, must be protected. 
So let’s be clear. I am not here today 
to spiral into the procedural argument 
regarding whether the filibuster in gen-
eral has merits or has outlived its use-
fulness. I am here to say that this issue 
is bigger than the filibuster. I stand be-
fore you saying that this issue—access 
to voting and preempting politicians’ 
efforts to restrict voting—is so funda-
mental to our democracy that it is too 
important to be held hostage by a Sen-
ate rule, especially one historically 
used to restrict the expansion of voting 
rights. It is a contradiction to say we 
must protect minority rights in the 
Senate while refusing to protect minor-
ity rights in the society. Colleagues, no 
Senate rule should overrule the integ-
rity of our democracy, and we must 
find a way to pass voting rights, wheth-
er we get rid of the filibuster or not. 
So as I close—and nobody believes a 
preacher when he says ‘‘as I close’’—let 
me say that I, as a man of faith, be-
lieve that democracy is the political 
enactment of a spiritual idea, the sa-
cred worth of all human beings, the no-
tion that we all have within us a spark 
of the divine, and a right to participate 
in the shaping of our destiny. Reinhold 
Niebuhr was right: 
[Humanity’s] capacity for justice makes 
democracy possible; but [humanity’s] incli-
nation to injustice makes democracy nec-
essary. 
John Lewis understood that and was 
beaten on a bridge defending it. Amelia 
Boynton, like so many women not 
mentioned nearly enough, was gassed 
on that same bridge. A White woman 
named Viola Liuzzo was killed. Medgar 
Evers was murdered in his own drive-
way. Schwerner, Chaney, and Good-
man, two Jews and an African Amer-
ican, standing up for that sacred idea 
of democracy, also paid the ultimate 
price. And we in this body would be 
stopped and stymied by bipartisan poli-
tics? Short-term political gain? Senate 
procedure? I say let’s get this done, no 
matter what. 
I urge my colleagues to pass these 
two bills, strengthen and lengthen the 
course of our democracy, secure our 
credibility as the premier voice for 
freedom-loving people and democratic 
movements all over the world, and win 
the future for all of our children. 
I yield the floor. 
(Applause.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
AGENT ORANGE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, we 
can be proud of the bipartisan work the 
Senate has accomplished in recent 
years to expand veterans’ benefits. 
Last Congress, we made significant 
progress with passage of legislation to 
enhance education, pensions, burial 
compensation, and landmark improve-
ments to Department of Veterans Af-
fairs care and services for women vet-
erans, in addition to a groundbreaking 
initiative to prevent veteran suicides. 
I am hopeful we can use this momen-
tum to continue turning legislation 
into law to ensure we fill the promise 
our country made to the men and 
women who served in uniform, as well 
as their families. We know that too 
many veterans are being left behind be-
cause of current VA policies that pro-
hibit them from accessing benefits and 
healthcare services they have earned. 
Veterans like Bill Rhodes of Mena, 
AR, a marine who served in Thailand 
during the Vietnam war era, are plead-
ing with Congress to help them get 
needed medical care and support. After 
developing illnesses linked to herbicide 
exposure, Mr. Rhodes turned to the VA 
for help. His claim was denied. He did 
his homework. He spent time looking 
for documentation to support his claim 
and realized this is a problem that 
needs a legislative fix because the De-
partment’s policies limit benefits for 
Vietnam war era for Thailand service. 
I am proud to join with my colleague 
and chairman of the Senate Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs, Senator TESTER, 
to introduce legislation to help Mr. 
Rhodes and veterans like him who were 
exposed to Agent Orange and other her-
bicides while serving in Thailand dur-
ing the Vietnam war. 
The VA accepts that herbicides were 
used on fenced-in perimeters of mili-
tary bases in Thailand, but its current 
policy is too restrictive. Among other 
things, 
it 
prohibits 
veterans 
who 
worked in security-related specialties. 
It is reasonable to believe that vet-
erans on Thai bases were exposed to 
Agent Orange no matter what their 
jobs were or where their duty stations 
were.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1585 
March 17, 2021 
In an article published in the Dayton 
Daily News, one veteran who served in 
Thailand said his barracks were along 
the perimeter, and at the time of the 
interview, he still hadn’t received ben-
efits for his VA claim. 
The arbitrary limits on consideration 
of a veteran’s claim to toxic exposure 
are simply wrong. These misguided 
technicalities and bureaucratic hurdles 
need to be addressed. Our bill would 
eliminate 
the 
unreasonable 
burden 
placed on veterans to prove toxic expo-
sure. 
No veteran should be denied benefits 
due to redtape. These Americans who 
served our country, and to this day are 
paying a high price as a result, have 
been carelessly hindered by the current 
limitations on the presumption of toxic 
exposure to Agent Orange, but they 
aren’t forgotten. We have an obligation 
to ensure they get the benefits they are 
due, and I am committed to supporting 
their cause. 
I appreciate the determination and 
tireless efforts of Mr. Rhodes. He said 
this legislation gives him some hope, 
but he won’t be proud of his work until 
the bill is passed. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
our legislation. I look forward to work-
ing with members of the Senate VA 
Committee to eliminate the barriers 
that prevent veterans from getting the 
care and resources they have earned. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate will soon vote on the nomination of 
California Attorney General Xavier 
Becerra to lead the Department of 
Health and Human Services. Moving 
this nomination forward required an 
additional procedural step and more 
floor debate than others, so I will make 
just a few quick points this afternoon. 
First, in our lifetime, America has 
never faced a greater public health 
challenge than the pandemic we face 
today. The Department of Health and 
Human Services is our point Agency, 
the leading Agency to coordinate the 
effort to end the pandemic as soon as 
possible. Right now, for example, it is 
coordinating the distribution of vac-
cines. It is working to get PPE, the 
critical protective equipment, into the 
hands of nurses and doctors and all 
those providers who desperately need 
more of it. The Department supports 
rural hospitals to keep them afloat so 
that rural patients have access to care. 
The Department’s work includes the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol, the National Institutes of Health, 
the National Guard, all 50 States and 
the District of Columbia, as well as pri-
vate healthcare systems, doctors, and 
many individuals across the country. 
The American people, we all know, 
are ready for this pandemic to end. 
They certainly understand that having 
a person to coordinate the critical ef-
forts of the Department of Health and 
Human Services confirmed and on the 
job is part of that effort. There simply 
is no argument for delaying this con-
firmation any longer. 
Attorney General Becerra has the 
right leadership experience and the 
right health policy experience to suc-
ceed in this critical job. He currently 
heads the Nation’s second largest de-
partment of justice. He is in charge of 
a billion-dollar budget and more than 
4,000 employees. He is the top law en-
forcement official in what would be the 
fifth largest economy in the world. 
In terms of health policy, which is in 
the area I try to specialize in, I can tell 
Senators that Xavier Becerra has spent 
years and years on these issues at the 
Ways and Means Committee, the key 
committee in the other body with ju-
risdiction over healthcare. He has been 
through major policy debates, includ-
ing the Affordable Care Act. As Califor-
nia’s attorney general, he defended the 
act in court. 
When the pandemic hit, he fought to 
protect the health and well-being of all 
Californians, particularly nurses and 
doctors and those workers who found 
themselves in harm’s way. 
Attorney General Becerra has the 
health policy savvy and the leadership 
savvy and the experience in both areas 
to run this Department, no question 
about it. 
Attorney General Becerra made it 
clear to members of the Finance Com-
mittee that he will follow the law. 
Quaint idea. He said it again and again 
in response to a barrage of questions. 
He is going to be accessible to Sen-
ators. He is going to work to find com-
mon ground on key healthcare issues. I 
was glad he said it because that is 
heavy lifting. Most of the time, that is 
really all you can ask of nominees of 
the other party. 
Healthcare is oftentimes a divisive 
subject. I think every Senator under-
stands that. It is particularly true 
when it comes to women’s healthcare. 
But it is clear to me that Attorney 
General Becerra wants to bring the two 
sides together. That is a great place to 
start after the last 4 years of knock-
down, drag-out battles over healthcare 
issues that clearly took America in the 
wrong direction. 
I am going to close with just one 
thought about why this position is so 
important. I don’t know of any pros-
pect more unifying among Americans 
than ending the pandemic and getting 
life back to normal as quickly as pos-
sible. Parents want their kids back in 
school. Grandparents want to hug their 
grandkids. Everybody wants to feel 
safe and get out in their communities. 
Getting our country to that point is 
the essence of what this job is all 
about. Heading the Department of 
Health and Human Services focuses ex-
actly on those things people want to 
have the country come together on. 
But we need to come together to beat 
the pandemic, and the Department 
needs its leader confirmed and on the 
job now. 
I was pleased that there was bipar-
tisan support for discharging Attorney 
General Becerra’s nomination from the 
Finance Committee. I hope the Senate 
gives his nomination bipartisan sup-
port once again when it is time to vote 
on his confirmation. 
I look forward to working with him 
in the months and years to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I oppose 
the confirmation of California Attor-
ney General Becerra to be the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services. 
Our future HHS Secretary will be at 
the helm of rebuilding our country to-
ward normalcy and preparing to ad-
dress the weaknesses in our healthcare 
infrastructure, brought to light by the 
pandemic. It will be no small task, and 
its handling will have an impact on 
America for years to come. It will re-
quire a leader at HHS who has the 
trust of the public and the requisite 
healthcare experience. Unfortunately, 
those two factors are missing from the 
nomination 
of 
Attorney 
General 
Becerra. 
In recovering from a once-in-a-cen-
tury public health emergency, Ameri-
cans need to have the confidence that 
our HHS Secretary understands the in-
tricacies of healthcare policy and has 
an eye to the future as we improve 
upon our prepandemic vulnerabilities, 
protecting future generations from ex-
periencing 
similar 
pandemic 
situa-
tions. 
While 
Attorney 
General 
Becerra 
served on a healthcare-focused sub-
committee as a U.S. Representative, he 
has no further experience in public 
health or medicine. He also lacks the 
executive experience that would be 
useful in running a complex executive 
branch Department like HHS, which is 
involved in the nationwide vaccine 
rollout and now the regulatory imple-
mentation of the recent $1.9 trillion 
package. 
The American people need to trust 
that their HHS Secretary will work for 
them, regardless of disagreements over 
ideology. Like a President, Cabinet of-
ficials work for the entire country, and 
broad public trust is essential. As Mr. 
Becerra was serving in his current role 
in California as attorney general, the 
Trump administration was making sig-
nificant regulatory changes to protect 
the sanctity of life. Attorney General 
Becerra then spent much of his time 
attempting to overturn or ignore those 
changes. 
Most 
recently, 
Attorney 
General 
Becerra actively defended a California 
law requiring abortion coverage in in-
surance plans offered by churches. The 
Office of Civil Rights at HHS ruled on 
January 24, 2020, that the State’s abor-
tion mandate violated Federal law, but 
Attorney General Becerra refused to 
comply. 
Ideological or moral disagreements 
should not be met with legal chal-
lenges. Americans need to know that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1586 
March 17, 2021 
their government is working to find a 
common ground that will protect all 
strongly held personal and religious be-
liefs, including the belief in the sanc-
tity of life. 
Thoughtful healthcare policy mat-
ters to Kansans and Americans now 
more than ever. We need a leader at 
HHS who is eager to serve all of the 
country, even in the face of disagree-
ments—one who has the necessary 
healthcare expertise to be successful in 
this position and will be an asset to our 
country in this time of rebuilding. 
I oppose this confirmation and urge 
my colleagues to join me. 
EQUALITY ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today 
the Senate Judiciary Committee is 
considering a grave threat to the right 
of conscience. The House recently 
passed the Equality Act, which would 
demolish religious liberty protections, 
ironically making Americans of cer-
tain beliefs decidedly unequal under 
the law. In other words, for something 
called religious protections, the Equal-
ity Act would diminish the capability 
to be considered equal under the law. 
It is not an accident of careless draft-
ing that permits this outcome. The 
language is both so expansive and so 
explicit that it must be intentional and 
it must be intentionally hostile to peo-
ple who hold such beliefs. 
The language expands the definition 
of public accommodations to include 
prohibiting discrimination by ‘‘any es-
tablishment that provides a good, serv-
ice, or program, including a . . . food 
bank, service or care center, [or] shel-
ter,’’ and any organization receiving 
Federal funding. Religiously affiliated 
entities seeking to put their beliefs 
into 
action 
outside 
their 
church, 
mosque, or synagogue must comply. 
The authors know such an expansive 
definition infringes on the constitu-
tional rights of religious liberty. That 
is because this legislation would ex-
plicitly—explicitly—deny recourse to 
the Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act, or RFRA, a bill that was passed 
with overwhelmingly bipartisan ma-
jorities in both Chambers of Congress 
before being signed by President Bill 
Clinton in 1993. 
This denial cuts off two legal paths 
for people of conscience. One, an indi-
vidual or institution cannot sue the 
Federal Government to prevent en-
forcement of this act without statu-
tory—explicit statutory—authority of 
RFRA. And, two, the individual insti-
tution that is sued for discrimination 
under this bill cannot rely on RFRA as 
a defense. 
It is not an exaggeration to say that 
the five lines related to RFRA in this 
bill represent one of the most dramatic 
assaults against religious faith and 
conscience that I have seen in my time 
in Congress. The effects will be dam-
aging to communities in Kansas and 
across the country. 
If passed, people of faith must decide 
whether to adhere to their deeply held 
beliefs or to the law. This law effec-
tively says it is better to have fewer 
doctors in rural Kansas, which des-
perately needs them, than it is to have 
doctors of moral conviction; that it is 
better to shutter social services admin-
istered by faith-based groups that fill 
gaps in our safety net than to allow 
them to remain true to their mission; 
or that it is better to force the closure 
of religious schools in urban areas, 
which so often provide a path out of 
poverty, than to allow them to remain 
open and teach principles of faith. 
In response to the Obama contracep-
tion mandate a decade ago, I warned: 
‘‘If the government can compel an indi-
vidual or group to violate one’s con-
science, then there is no limit to gov-
ernment power.’’ That remains true 
now, nearly 10 years later, and remains 
true into the future. 
I will oppose the use of such govern-
ment power to infringe on matters of 
religious belief and conscience, and I 
stand in opposition to the Equality 
Act. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it ap-
pears that our friends across the aisle 
are experiencing an existential crisis 
when it comes to deciding how to man-
age their newfound powers in the ma-
jority. We are just 21⁄2 months into this 
new Congress, and already we are hear-
ing the majority leader and many on 
the other side of the aisle threatening 
to blow up the rules of the Senate. 
After decades as a Senator, President 
Biden even yesterday relented and 
threw his support behind the plan. 
The filibuster has been called into 
question a number of times over the 
past few years. That is to be expected, 
but it is just that our Democratic 
friends used to be on the other side of 
the argument. They took one position 
when they were in the minority, where 
the filibuster protected their rights. 
And now when they are in the major-
ity, many of them are looking to elimi-
nate any minority rights and to fun-
damentally change the Senate. 
In 2018, our Democratic colleagues 
were afraid the Republican Senate ma-
jority would blow up the filibuster. I 
am not really sure why they were con-
cerned. After all, Senator MCCONNELL 
and Republican Senators have consist-
ently defended the rights of the minor-
ity by use of the legislative filibuster, 
even when President Trump called for 
it to be eliminated. 
But our Democratic friends keep pil-
ing on. Senator DURBIN, the Senator 
from Illinois, the chairman of the Judi-
ciary Committee, was asked about 
President Trump’s call to end the fili-
buster—that 
was 
when 
President 
Trump called to end the filibuster—and 
he said: ‘‘That would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and 
created going back to the Founding Fa-
thers.’’ That would be on the right- 
hand side of this chart. Just to repeat, 
he said: ‘‘That would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and 
created going back to the Founding Fa-
thers.’’ 
I agree with Senator DURBIN. I agreed 
then, and I agree now. 
The Senate filibuster was designed to 
ensure that the two political parties 
would actually have to work together, 
which I think the American people be-
lieve is a good thing. And it should be 
hard to do the work of building con-
sensus in a country as big and diverse 
as the United States. 
But the filibuster was designed to 
make sure that the majority just 
couldn’t jam things through and deny 
the rights of the minority to be heard. 
But when you get 60 Senators to agree 
on something, it becomes all but im-
possible for ultrapartisan proposals to 
become law. That is the nature of the 
consensus-building process, and that is 
a good thing for the country. 
Imagine the instability and unpre-
dictability that would occur if laws 
changed as quickly as Presidents and 
Senate majorities do. Just 4 years ago, 
Republicans controlled both Chambers 
of Congress and held the White House. 
Twelve years ago, our Democratic col-
leagues controlled all three. The fili-
buster was designed to encourage, 
again, consensus building on a bipar-
tisan basis and to provide some sta-
bility between those transitory majori-
ties and changing Presidents. And that 
is a good thing, like I said, in a country 
where the political party in control is 
constantly changing, and it ensures 
that a minority viewpoint cannot be 
steamrolled. 
Our Senate Democratic friends have 
certainly benefited from the protec-
tions of the filibuster over the last 6 
years. They filibustered countless bills 
on everything from pandemic relief to 
police reform. 
But now it appears that our Demo-
cratic colleagues—at least their leader-
ship—have flip-flopped. The political 
tides have shifted, and since the radical 
left wants to get rid of the filibuster, 
so do they. 
In a floor speech earlier this week, 
this same Senator, Senator DURBIN, 
our friend from Illinois, said the fili-
buster is ‘‘not the guarantor of democ-
racy. It has become the death grip of 
democracy’’—a pretty dramatic con-
version from 2018 to 2021. 
What has changed? Well, the major-
ity has changed. Republicans con-
trolled the majority when he thought 
the filibuster was a good thing. Now, 
when Democrats control the majority, 
he thinks it is a bad thing. 
Apparently, the countless filibusters 
of our Democratic colleagues were not 
a mockery of democracy. They cer-
tainly wouldn’t be guilty of that. But

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1587 
March 17, 2021 
now that the shoe is on the other foot, 
Democrats are ready to hit the big red 
button and go nuclear. And, I must say, 
once you go nuclear around here, you 
certainly don’t go back. 
But Senator DURBIN’s views aren’t 
the only ones that have changed on 
this matter. As I mentioned, former 
Senator and now President Joe Biden 
finally changed his views as well. For 
decades, he was a staunch defender of 
the institution. When he was asked 
about removing the filibuster, going 
nuclear, he said: 
This nuclear option is ultimately an exam-
ple of the arrogance of power. It is a funda-
mental power-grab by the majority party. 
Well, that is certainly not mincing 
your words. And this isn’t some long 
ago abandoned view of his. In January 
of this year, President Biden was asked 
if he could move his agenda with the 
filibuster rules intact, and he answered 
yes and explained the opportunities to 
work together on shared priorities, as 
he did throughout his career as a U.S. 
Senator. 
He went on to add: 
I think we can reach consensus on that and 
get it passed without changing the filibuster 
rule. 
But now the pressure has been put on 
both President Biden and the Demo-
cratic leadership in the Senate to en-
dorse a rules change, not by the ordi-
nary course of rule changes but by the 
nuclear option. We know that there are 
unpredictable consequences of chang-
ing the rules in a place where your 
power, where your majority, is never 
guaranteed. Chipping away at the 
rights of the minority may help you 
today, but you will live to regret it 
when the shoe is on the other foot. 
But it won’t take a shift in the ma-
jority for our Democratic colleagues to 
see the disastrous consequences of 
going nuclear on the filibuster rule be-
cause, if anybody needed a reminder, 
we have a 50–50 Senate: 50 Democrats 
and 50 Republicans. 
Yesterday, Senator MCCONNELL, the 
Republican leader, somebody who has 
been around this institution a long 
time and understands it better than al-
most anybody I know, reminded our 
colleagues that ‘‘[t]his is an institution 
that requires unanimous consent to 
turn the lights on before noon.’’ 
Unanimous consent is literally the 
grease that helps the machine run. In 
order to accomplish even the most 
mundane tasks in the Senate, you need 
an agreement. Most of the time it is 
easy because it is not controversial; it 
is not partisan; it is the right, prac-
tical thing to do. But you need com-
promise, and you need a quorum. 
This 
rules 
change 
being 
floated 
wouldn’t clear a path for productivity 
in the Senate. It is an invitation to fu-
tility. If our Democratic colleagues 
take the unprecedented step of blowing 
up the filibuster, they can expect to be 
met with an unprecedented response. 
Republicans will not sit idly by while 
Democrats take an axe to the rules in 
order to advance a partisan agenda. If 
Democrats go down this road, they will 
have no one to blame but themselves 
for the consequences of a horrible mis-
calculation. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. President, on another matter, as 
we know, it has been more than a year 
since the term ‘‘COVID–19’’ became a 
part of our daily vocabulary. Over this 
last year, families have lost loved ones, 
millions of workers have lost their 
jobs, Main Street businesses have shut-
tered, and our healthcare workers have 
endured unimaginable stress and heart-
break. 
One year ago, the majority of Ameri-
cans were hunkered down at home in 
order to stop the spread of this deadly 
virus, and today, while we continue to 
follow the commonsense public health 
guidelines to stop the spread of the 
virus, we are finally experiencing some 
hope. With three successful vaccines 
now being administered throughout the 
country, the light at the end of the 
tunnel gets bigger and brighter every 
day. I know we are all grateful for 
that. 
More than 27 percent of Americans 18 
and up have received at least one dose 
of the vaccine. That includes nearly 
two-thirds of people over the age of 65, 
one of the most vulnerable cohorts. We 
have every reason to be optimistic that 
brighter days are ahead, but we are not 
out of the dark yet. 
In the coming months, we need sound 
leadership from public health officials 
who have the experience and the exper-
tise to guide us through these final, 
critical months. Unfortunately, Presi-
dent Biden has nominated someone 
who is unprepared to lead that charge. 
The President has chosen Xavier 
Becerra to be his Secretary of Health 
and Human Services. As we know, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices is one of the top generals in the 
war against COVID–19. The Depart-
ment coordinates the healthcare pro-
viders, State and local officials, re-
searchers, and the American public to 
respond to a crisis like this. For every-
thing from COVID–19 testing to treat-
ment and therapeutics, to vaccina-
tions, HHS is actually in charge. 
The Department disburses funding. It 
determines how many vaccines go to 
each State. It leads efforts to boost 
public confidence in the vaccine and so 
much more, but that is not even in-
cluding the long list of nonpandemic 
responsibilities for the Department, in-
cluding everything from overseeing 
Medicare and Medicaid to regulating 
prescription drugs. 
So what life experience does Mr. 
Becerra have that makes him qualified 
to lead these efforts? Well, he is not a 
doctor. He is not a public health ex-
pert. He has never even worked in a 
role 
that 
is 
remotely 
related 
to 
healthcare. 
In 
fact, 
his 
only 
semirelevant experience is the range of 
lawsuits he has filed as attorney gen-
eral of his home State of California. 
Mr. Becerra led a group of attorneys 
general in opposing the Texas lawsuit 
Texas v. Azar. The case attempted to 
reinstate the individual mandate pen-
alty which was removed by the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act. He also led a case 
attempting to overturn protections for 
religious groups, such as the Little Sis-
ters of the Poor, that don’t offer cov-
erage for contraceptives in their group 
health insurance plans. He sued them. 
Well—no surprise—the Supreme Court 
ultimately ruled 7 to 2 in favor of the 
Little Sisters of the Poor. 
And, as we know, Mr. Becerra’s rad-
ical policy objectives date long before 
his time as attorney general. As a 
Member of the House, he took extreme 
views on abortion. He opposed legisla-
tion that would ensure that babies who 
were born after a botched abortion 
would receive medical treatment, just 
like any other patient. 
He opposed a bill to prevent taxpayer 
dollars from being used for abortions, 
the Hyde amendment, which has been 
bipartisan consensus for at least since 
the late seventies. He even opposed leg-
islation to make it a crime to harm or 
kill an unborn child during the com-
mission of a violent crime. In 38 States, 
including his State of California, they 
already have similar protections, but 
he opposed legislation to do it. 
Unlike the majority of President 
Biden’s nominees who received bipar-
tisan support by both the committees 
of jurisdiction and the full Senate, 
there is no bipartisan chorus singing 
the praises of Mr. Becerra. Put simply, 
he is a partisan warrior who lacks the 
experience to lead HHS during normal 
times, let alone during a pandemic. 
We are at the 10-yard line in the pan-
demic. Now is not the time to give the 
punter a chance to try out his quarter-
back just because he happens to be 
friends with the coach. 
I would oppose the nomination of Mr. 
Becerra and encourage my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to do so as 
well. The American people deserve an 
experienced Health and Human Serv-
ices Secretary, and this nominee does 
not fit the bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
SUNSHINE WEEK 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, it has 
been a year now since the outbreak of 
a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. 
It put the world into an unprecedented 
global lockdown, and we are still in the 
dark about how the pandemic even 
began. 
Folks, this isn’t entirely an accident. 
The virus emerged in one of the world’s 
most closed societies, ruled by a ruth-
less authoritarian regime with no tol-
erance for truth or transparency. And, 
even today, after 21⁄2 million people 
around the world have died, the Com-
munist Party of China refuses to fully 
cooperate with efforts to learn how 
COVID–19 made the cross-species jump 
from bats to humans. Finding the 
source isn’t about assigning blame; it 
is about understanding the cause and 
preventing a similar occurrence from 
happening again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1588 
March 17, 2021 
Here is what we do know: COVID ap-
peared in the vicinity of the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology, a laboratory where 
studies were being conducted on bat 
coronaviruses. 
After 
the 
outbreak 
began, Chinese officials ordered the de-
struction of coronavirus samples. In 
the months just prior to the first case 
of the new pathogen being publicly 
identified, researchers at this state-run 
lab 
reportedly 
became 
sick 
with 
COVID-like symptoms. 
Years ago, U.S. officials who visited 
the institute sent warnings back to the 
State Department that studies were 
being 
conducted 
on 
dangerous 
coronaviruses from bats that could be 
transmitted to humans in a lab which 
had ‘‘serious’’ safety problems. 
Some of that research was even being 
subsidized by U.S. taxpayer dollars, in-
cluding a study published less than 2 
years before the pandemic that found 
the first evidence that humans could be 
infected with coronaviruses from bats. 
You heard that correctly, folks. Your 
tax dollars were paying for dangerous 
studies on coronaviruses in a lab in 
China that our own government offi-
cials had warned was unsafe. 
This all raises many questions, the 
first being, How much were we actually 
paying for this endeavor? And that 
should be relatively easy for anyone to 
discover since a law renewed by Con-
gress every single year requires all 
projects supported by the Department 
of Health and Human Services to in-
clude a pricetag disclosing the cost 
paid by taxpayers. But noticeably ab-
sent on the study from the Wuhan In-
stitute: the cost. 
A review of numerous other projects 
supported by HHS found that cost in-
formation was missing from all of 
them—all of them. Covering up infor-
mation that the public has a right to 
know about might be how things work 
in Communist China, but it isn’t how it 
should work here in America. 
This isn’t China, folks. Our laws 
aren’t optional, especially for those 
who are supposed to be enforcing them. 
Maybe we can’t force China to be 
forthcoming, but we should be able to 
expect our own government to be open 
and transparent. That is why I am ask-
ing the HHS Office of Inspector General 
to launch an investigation to compel 
the Department to comply with the 
law. 
I am also introducing legislation to 
require every project funded with your 
taxpayer dollars to disclose the cost 
paid by you. This is just one of the 
bright ideas to shine some light on how 
your money is being spent that I will 
be unveiling this week to commemo-
rate Sunshine Week, the annual cele-
bration of open government. 
A transparent government is one of 
the most fundamental principles that 
make our government—of the people, 
by the people, for the people—work. 
Decisions are made every day in Wash-
ington that impact families and com-
munities in Iowa and across the coun-
try. 
We all benefit when we bring this in-
formation to light, especially when it 
involves how our tax dollars are being 
spent. That is why I am also working 
to create an alert system to notify the 
public whenever a project goes $1 bil-
lion or more over budget or falls 5 
years behind schedule. 
Some good news: My bipartisan bill 
was just reported out of committee 
this morning, so boondoggles, you bet-
ter beware. 
Another bill I will be supporting will 
require hospitals and insurers to reveal 
rates to patients before they receive 
their medical care. This commonsense 
effort would allow patients to know the 
costs associated with their healthcare 
in advance so that they can make in-
formed decisions for themselves and 
their families. 
Finally, I am calling for more trans-
parency from the Department of Edu-
cation when it comes to COVID spend-
ing. Taxpayers should be able to see 
clearly how well States and school dis-
tricts are doing at spending tax dollars 
provided to help schools safely reopen. 
Knowledge is the power that allows 
every citizen to hold those entrusted to 
make our decisions accountable. After 
all, the only reason to keep taxpayers 
in the dark about any of these deci-
sions is because they can’t withstand 
the scrutiny that results when all of 
the facts come to light. 
With the Sun now setting an hour 
later as a result of daylight saving 
time, we are all reminded just how 
much a difference can be made with a 
little extra sunlight. After all, sun-
shine is the best disinfectant because 
to stop waste, we first need to be able 
to spot it. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Indiana. 
HEALTHCARE 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I 
have come to the floor several times in 
the little over 2 years I have been here, 
and a common theme—and I think we 
all know it as Senators—is that our 
healthcare system is broken. It is driv-
en by misaligned industry incentives 
that 
promote 
opaque, 
behind-the- 
scenes pricing maneuvers at the ex-
pense of patients and healthcare con-
sumers. 
Increased transparency is the key to 
fixing our broken healthcare system. It 
will allow Americans to have skin in 
the game and deal directly with their 
healthcare providers to make informed 
decisions. They cannot do that very 
well currently. 
Pulling 
the 
curtain 
back 
on 
a 
healthcare system to restore market 
forces, which aren’t really there now, 
to increase innovation and competi-
tion, particularly in regard to price, 
quality, and service—you do that with 
anything else. A consumer is engaged, 
they are informed, and you have many 
competitors competing for their busi-
ness. 
In order for Americans to regain 
their sovereignty in a healthcare sys-
tem, you need the ability to be able to 
navigate accordingly. Congress must 
act to provide Americans with these 
tools before we try to throw more gov-
ernment at a broken healthcare sys-
tem. 
Government pays for a portion of 
healthcare; more is paid through the 
private sector. If we reform it, it 
makes it less expensive for both pay-
ers. To give you an example, some-
times what you hear here sounds like 
it is theoretical, hypothetical. I took 
on the cause roughly 12, 13 years ago in 
my Main Street enterprise that was 
just starting to grow, doing the things 
it was supposed to do, and that is 
transportation distribution. Then all of 
a sudden, healthcare becomes a subset 
of your business, and about the only so-
lution you would get each year is, well, 
you are lucky it is not going up more 
than 5 or 10 percent. 
I heard that too many years in a row. 
I was sick and tired of that being what 
I would have to live with as a CEO who 
had a healthy, successful business 
other than the healthcare component. 
What did I do? Healthcare plans are ba-
sically made up of three or four fea-
tures. 
You have your deductible. Ours had 
risen more than I was willing to take it 
up any higher. The only way you could 
buy premiums down would be to do 
that or change underwriters every 2 or 
3 years. That gets to be a hassle as you 
become a larger company, and the prof-
its were so great then for people who 
did it, you could end up bringing your 
cost down. Well, then you were right 
back in the old groove of, you are 
lucky it is only going up 5 to 10 percent 
the next year on renewal. 
You also have coinsurance. Most peo-
ple don’t worry about that until they 
get significantly ill or have a bad acci-
dent. That is the percentage you have 
to pay once you exceed your deduct-
ible. 
When you have those variables, you 
have one other item that almost every-
one loves in their plan, and that is a 
low copayment. Those copayments are 
paid for in the high premiums, but it is 
because they constitute nearly 25 per-
cent of most healthcare plans, and that 
is to keep skin out of the game for the 
people who use the system. 
Well, I was going to do something dif-
ferent and decided to limit that ex-
pense when you really get sick or have 
a bad accident, covered coinsurance 
through the company, and asked my 
employees to engage from dollar one in 
shopping around and see if that would 
work. 
Lo and behold, it has now been 13 
years, and we have been able to keep a 
good 
plan 
in 
place, 
lower 
family 
healthcare premium contributions, and 
have not had a premium increase. What 
is it based upon? It is finding the mea-
ger transparency that was out there 12, 
13 years ago and enhancing it over 
time. To give an example, if you pick 
up the phone, you get on the web, you 
will find anywhere from 30, 50, 60, 70

percent savings. Procedures like MRIs, 
CAT scans, colonoscopies can run any-
where from 700 to 3,000 bucks. Your in-
surance companies seem to always 
shove you to the most expensive one. 
They give you these huge discounts, 
take their margin out of it, and it still 
costs you a bundle. 
When the consumer gets engaged, 
you will see prices start to come down. 
LASIK surgery is the best example, 
where you have no insurance involved. 
Ten, fifteen years ago, that could be up 
to $2,000 an eye. Now, it is advertised 
heavily, providers go after their cus-
tomers, and you can probably get it 
done for as little as $250 to $500 an eye, 
with better quality. That sounds like a 
lot of other areas of our economy that 
actually work. 
Last 
Congress, 
I 
put 
healthcare 
transparency at the forefront of my 
agenda and have definitely been the 
most outspoken Senator that we have 
a broken system; put almost all the 
blame on the industry itself because it 
does not give us transparency. It does 
not want to compete. The healthcare 
customer is somewhat to blame be-
cause they don’t want to pay for any-
thing. And I don’t think the answer is 
bringing more government into it until 
you reform the system. 
We need to shine light on the dark 
corners and the misaligned incentives 
embedded 
in 
the 
current 
system. 
Among the bills I will reintroduce this 
Congress is the Healthcare PRICE 
Transparency 
Act. 
Every 
Senator 
should want to be on that bill to hold 
the industry accountable. This will em-
power patients through transparency. 
It will drive competition among hos-
pitals and insurers by requiring them 
to publicly disclose their prices so pa-
tients can compare between providers 
and insurers. 
Last Congress, a number of my col-
leagues joined in my effort to bring 
more transparency and affordability to 
healthcare consumers. I am excited to 
reintroduce 
the 
Healthcare 
PRICE 
Transparency Act soon and hope all of 
my colleagues will join in so that we 
can collectively lower healthcare costs 
before we try to get more government 
involved. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
SUNSHINE WEEK 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I am proud to join my colleagues 
in celebration of Sunshine Week and 
promote the importance of government 
openness 
and 
transparency. 
Trans-
parency isn’t something you see too 
much up here in Washington. Being ac-
countable to the American people 
should be a basic function of govern-
ment. 
In Florida, we have sunshine laws to 
promote openness and build our citi-
zens’ trust in government. When I 
came to Washington, I made it my mis-
sion to bring the success and trans-
parency we had in Florida to the Fed-
eral Government and make this dys-
functional place work for the American 
people. 
Unfortunately, my Democratic col-
leagues have blocked nearly every sin-
gle one of my efforts for transparency 
and requests for information to help 
Congress make the best decisions for 
American families. 
Last month, I wrote to President 
Biden’s Acting Director for the Office 
of Management and Budget requesting 
any documents related to enacted but 
currently unspent COVID–19 stimulus 
funding. The response? None. Total si-
lence. 
This month, as we considered the 
Democrats’ wasteful and partisan $1.9 
trillion COVID spending package, I in-
troduced a resolution calling on Presi-
dent Biden to inform the Senate and 
the American people of how much 
unspent funds are left over from the 
previous COVID spending bills, but 
Democrats blocked it. 
When my colleague Senator JOHNSON 
called for their massive, 600-page bill 
to be read on the floor so the American 
people could know exactly what was in 
the bill, Democrats complained and 
called it a waste of time. 
Let me be clear. Being transparent, 
open, and accountable to the American 
people is actually never a waste of 
time; it is our job. That is why I have 
been working on several measures to 
bring sunshine transparency to Wash-
ington, including my bill to make sure 
Members of Congress work for the 
American people and actually read 
bills before casting their votes and my 
STOP COVID–19 Act to set vaccine dis-
tribution reporting and transparency 
standards for States and create a pro-
gram for cities and counties to increase 
funding, testing, contact tracing, and 
transparency efforts in order to reduce 
the spread of COVID. 
I will never stop fighting to bring 
sunshine to Washington and working 
to make sure our government and the 
Biden administration are transparent, 
open, and accountable to the American 
people who elected us to serve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
want to start by thanking Senator 
ERNST for once again setting up the 
Government Sunshine Week event and 
for her commitment, as was just dis-
cussed by my colleague from Florida, 
to ensuring taxpayers know where 
their money is going. This includes the 
$150 billion that the U.S. Government 
distributes every year in taxpayer 
funds for research grants. More trans-
parency will help ensure that research 
isn’t stolen by China and other coun-
tries. 
In 2019, as the then-chairman of the 
Permanent Subcommittee on Inves-
tigations, or PSI, I led a bipartisan in-
vestigation with then-ranking-member 
Senator TOM CARPER into China’s theft 
of U.S. intellectual property and U.S. 
research at our research institutions 
and college campuses. 
As many of you know, China has 
made no secret of its goal to surpass 
the United States as the world leader 
in scientific research. This has become 
even clearer, by the way, during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, as China has at-
tempted to get information in the 
United States to help produce their 
own vaccines to rival ours. But what 
most don’t know is that China has been 
using our taxpayer-funded research en-
terprise here in the United States to 
accomplish this long-term goal. China 
uses talent recruitment programs— 
most notably its Thousand Talents 
Plan—to recruit researchers at Amer-
ican universities and research institu-
tions using taxpayer-funded grants to 
do the same research at shadow labs in 
China or transfer taxpayer-funded re-
search back to China—research that 
has been used over the past two dec-
ades to strengthen China’s military 
and its own economic rise. 
Along the way, they have been aided 
by a lack of transparency in our Fed-
eral grant-making process that has al-
lowed researchers to receive taxpayer 
funding without disclosing their ties to 
foreign governments. What is worse, 
Federal law enforcement officials at 
the FBI knew about this for years and 
admitted at our PSI hearing last Con-
gress: ‘‘We wish we had taken more 
rapid and comprehensive action in the 
past.’’ I wish they had. 
I am pleased the Trump administra-
tion chose to follow through on their 
promise to do better in this regard. 
Since our report, prosecutors have 
charged at least 13 researchers here in 
the United States for failing to disclose 
their ties to the Chinese Government 
and 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party—re-
searchers at prestigious institutions 
like Harvard and the Ohio State Uni-
versity. Many of our colleges and uni-
versities around the country have been 
part of this. 
The Biden administration must stand 
by the promises made on the campaign 
trail to keep the pressure on China, 
and that includes on this issue. We can 
also help here in Congress by shining a 
light on the grant-making process and 
passing laws to help us keep track and 
protect these important investments in 
our research. 
In the coming weeks, I will be re-
introducing 
bipartisan 
legislation 
called the Safeguarding American In-
novation Act, which uses the key find-
ings from our bipartisan PSI investiga-
tion and report to protect the research 
enterprise—in 
part, 
through 
more 
transparency. 
First, our bill creates a cross-govern-
mental council at the Office of Man-
agement and Budget to coordinate and 
streamline unauthorized access and 
grant-making processes between Fed-
eral Agencies so that there is greater 
transparency in where the money is 
going and how it is being used. 
Second, the Safeguarding American 
Innovation Act makes it illegal to lie 
on a grant application about ties to

foreign governments like China. Trans-
parency here will make it clear that re-
searchers are liable for attempting to 
mislead the government when trying to 
receive taxpayer funds. 
Third, our legislation closes loop-
holes exploited by China and other for-
eign actors and empowers the State 
Department to deny visas to foreign re-
searchers aiming to steal U.S. intellec-
tual property and research. 
Fourth, the Safeguarding American 
Innovation Act requires research insti-
tutions and universities to safeguard 
against unauthorized access to sen-
sitive technology and to be transparent 
with the State Department about what 
technologies a foreign researcher will 
have access to on campus. 
Finally, 
the 
act 
requires 
trans-
parency from our colleges and univer-
sities as to what money they are get-
ting from foreign sources. They will 
have to report any foreign gift of 
$50,000 or more, and it empowers the 
Department of Education to fine uni-
versities that repeatedly fail to dis-
close these gifts. Current law requires 
reporting, but at $250,000. We found 
that nearly 70 percent of U.S. univer-
sities consistently failed to do even 
that. Lowering the threshold increases 
transparency, and adding the penalty 
ensures the schools will report. 
The American Council on Education 
has supported our PSI report’s rec-
ommendation that research institu-
tions should establish a ‘‘know your 
collaborator’’ culture. 
Greater transparency in our Federal 
grant-making 
process, 
great 
trans-
parency from our research institutions 
and universities—these are the steps 
we need to take to ensure that there is 
proper accountability in place for the 
$150 billion that taxpayers entrust with 
the government for federally funded re-
search every year, while still keeping 
our fundamental research open and col-
laborative. 
The Safeguarding American Innova-
tion Act will shine a light on the Fed-
eral grant-making processes and allow 
us to maintain our world-class lead in 
innovations, while protecting our in-
vestments from foreign theft. 
Again, I want to thank my colleague 
Senator ERNST, in particular, for this 
event today to talk about trans-
parency, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation that 
will provide long overdue transparency 
in our federally funded research enter-
prise. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
about 4 weeks ago, it got cold in Okla-
homa—really cold. My house was at 
negative 14 degrees. Now, Senator 
STEVE DAINES from Montana is used to 
that, but in Oklahoma we are not used 
to negative 14 degrees. It was overcast, 
snowy, cold. Then, the sun broke 
through, and we had a day when it got 
up to 30 degrees. It was like everyone 
was going to the park. It felt so nice 
because the sun was out, even though 
it was cold. 
Sunshine has a great way of making 
everyone lift and look around and say: 
Where has that been? 
I think that happens in the Federal 
Government as well. 
I thank Senator JONI
ERNST
for 
hosting what she is calling Sunshine 
Week to be able to say: What are we 
doing to put a little light into the Fed-
eral process to be able to make sure 
people can see into some of these pro-
grams? Because all the time I hear 
from 
people, 
and 
when 
something 
comes on the news, they will say: 
Where did that come from? 
I will say: That was poked in some 
bill that probably no one read. 
I will give you an example of it. Two 
weeks ago, when the ‘‘COVID’’ bill 
passed with almost $2 trillion in spend-
ing, I already had folks come back to 
me saying: I am grateful for that $70 
million for the Small Business Admin-
istration to increase some of the loans 
by $70 million. 
I said: Great. Do you know how much 
the administrative cost was on that $70 
million program? 
The answer is $390 million in admin-
istrative costs, $70 million in loans. 
That is in the bill. 
Everyone looks at me and says: Oh, I 
didn’t know that. 
In lots of States around America 
right now, their legislatures are meet-
ing, including mine in Oklahoma. They 
are suddenly finding out that that bill 
that was for ‘‘COVID-related’’ man-
dated that no State in America could 
reduce taxes on anyone. Lots of States 
are saying: Wait a minute; we were 
planning on reducing taxes on working 
families in certain targeted areas. 
They are finding out that you can’t 
do that, and they will say things like: 
I didn’t know that was in the bill be-
cause there wasn’t any sunshine on 
that bill. 
I worked for years to pass a bill 
called the Taxpayers Right-To-Know 
Act. It is a commonsense bill. It asks a 
simple question: What programs do we 
do in the Federal Government? This 
body has heard about me talk about it 
year after year after year. Contrary to 
popular belief, it is not easy to actu-
ally move a bill in this place. Some 
things that are very commonsense take 
forever. 
This was my simple bill. In the Fed-
eral Government, every Agency has to 
list every program that they do, how 
many employees they hire to do that 
program, what is the cost of the pro-
gram, and is the program evaluated? If 
it is, just put the evaluation numbers 
with the program. 
Why would I say that? Because I talk 
to Agency heads that start a new pro-
gram and they get 2 years down the 
road from starting a new program and 
they find out a different Agency has al-
ready done that for 5 years. Then we 
get together and find out a third Agen-
cy started that 10 years ago. None of 
them knew about the other program. 
Before you think that doesn’t hap-
pen, oh, yes, it does. It happens all the 
time. Not only that, but I want to ask 
a simple question to say: How many 
options do we have for whatever it may 
be? How many programs do we have for 
STEM education, for instance? How 
many different incentives have we put 
out there, and how many Agencies are 
helping to provide greater STEM edu-
cation? The Agencies can’t tell me. 
They could eventually tell me what is 
in their Agency, but they don’t know 
what other Agencies are doing. 
And when I go to the GAO, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, and ask 
them, their answer is: I will get you an 
answer back in about 18 months— 
months—18 months before they can tell 
me how many STEM programs we have 
in the Federal Government. I should be 
able to do an internet search and get 
that in 18 seconds, not 18 months. 
The Taxpayers Right-To-Know bill 
requires the Office of Management and 
Budget to actually work with every 
Agency to get a master list of every 
program across the Federal Govern-
ment—how many employees they have, 
if it is evaluated, and what it does. 
It is pretty simple. It is basic trans-
parency, but it allows any American 
and all Members of Congress to be able 
to see what we do and if we have dupli-
cation in government. 
Again, you may think that is simple 
and straightforward. It is, but it took 
years to actually pass. We finally got 
that passed and signed into law last 
December. 
I met with Gene Dodaro, who heads 
up GAO, and asked him about it be-
cause he has also been an advocate of 
that for years. He said: We need an 
‘‘unequivocal commitment from the 
Office of Management and Budget to 
implement it properly’’ because we 
have to actually get this done. 
Sunshine helps. We can see how 
money is spent. We can see how dupli-
cation actually functions. We can’t re-
form what we can’t see. The American 
people perpetually get frustrated with 
what they didn’t know was in a bill and 
find out later, and they don’t like it. 
In the days ahead, I will release my 
annual ‘‘Federal Fumbles’’ book, as we 
do every year. In that ‘‘Federal Fum-
bles’’ book, this year, we are going to 
outline where our debt comes from be-
cause I run into so many people who 
say: We have debt. Who is our debt? Is 
it all China? 
I will say: Well, actually, $1.6 trillion 
of it is from China, and we are paying 
them interest every single year on that 
debt. But it is in a lot of other places. 
A lot of people misunderstand what 
government debt really is. This needs 
some sunshine because if we are going 
to solve this, the American people have 
to be able to see it and so do we. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1591 
March 17, 2021 
With $1.3 trillion of spending in 
Health and Human Services, that De-
partment has the largest budget of the 
entire executive branch. In fact, if we 
were to compare the budget—the budg-
et of HHS to other nation’s GDPs— 
HHS, in fact, would rank among the 
top 10 in the world. The size of this De-
partment is significant, and the re-
sponsibility is even greater. 
Whoever oversees this Department 
has a big impact on our country, our 
economy, and the lives of all Ameri-
cans, including those of the unborn. 
This is exactly why I am deeply con-
cerned with President Biden’s pick of 
Attorney General Xavier Becerra to 
lead HHS. Mr. Becerra has spent his ca-
reer propagating far-left ideology and 
supporting divisive policies that don’t 
resonate with the majority of Ameri-
cans. 
The Secretary of HHS has massive 
authority 
to 
steer 
the 
future 
of 
healthcare in our country, and some-
one who has made a career out of de-
fending the abortion industry and pro-
moting other liberal policies, like free 
healthcare 
for 
illegal 
immigrants, 
should not be at the helm of this De-
partment. 
I am concerned that Attorney Gen-
eral Becerra will use the power of this 
Agency to overstep and impose his rad-
ical liberal agenda on millions of 
Americans. This administration decid-
edly, intentionally, chose a nominee 
who has repeatedly attacked the reli-
gious freedoms of so many Americans, 
a nominee who has aggressively pushed 
a very pro-abortion agenda, a nominee 
who supports a complete takeover by 
the government of our healthcare, a 
nominee who advocates for illegal im-
migrants to receive taxpayer-funded 
healthcare. 
How do these qualities make Attor-
ney General Becerra the right person 
to head Health and Human Services? It 
just doesn’t make sense to so many in 
our country. It is just another sign 
that this, unfortunately, is a far-left 
administration that is outside the 
mainstream. 
Especially now, during a pandemic, it 
is critical that all Americans can trust 
whoever holds this position. It is crit-
ical that the leader of this massive De-
partment will operate as a good stew-
ard of Federal health programs and not 
use his post to impose a government 
takeover of healthcare and to eradicate 
job-based coverage for millions of 
Americans. 
Xavier Becerra is, unfortunately, not 
that person. He has built his career de-
fending some of the very most extreme 
stances in our society, and we can ex-
pect that he will only take things fur-
ther at HHS. 
When it comes to abortion, Attorney 
General Becerra doesn’t believe there 
should be any restrictions—not one. In 
fact, I had the chance to ask Mr. 
Becerra some questions a couple of 
weeks ago at a hearing. I asked if he 
would support a ban on the lethal dis-
crimination of babies diagnosed with 
Down syndrome, or, perhaps, what 
about banning sex-selective abortions, 
or, at least, a ban on partial birth abor-
tions. His refusal to answer spoke vol-
umes. His inability to name even one 
restriction that he might think about 
putting on abortion is chilling. 
Mr. Becerra’s views on abortion even 
go a step further. He has repeatedly 
bullied and harassed Americans who re-
spect the sanctity of life, like the Lit-
tle Sisters of the Poor. This order of 
nuns has dedicated their lives to serv-
ing the less fortunate, and under their 
Catholic faith, they do not believe in 
providing abortions or contraceptives. 
Attorney General Becerra litigated 
against these nuns in court and at-
tempted to revoke an exemption that 
protects religious groups from pro-
viding contraceptives, and that goes 
against their religious beliefs. He has 
literally sued to impose crippling fines 
on Catholic nuns for remaining true to 
their religious believes—crippling fines 
on 
nuns—a 
horrendous 
attack 
on 
Americans’ constitutional right to reli-
gious freedom. 
He has stated that crossing the bor-
der illegally should be decriminalized. 
Let me say that again. He has stated 
that 
crossing 
the 
border 
illegally 
should be decriminalized. No wonder 
we are seeing a crisis on our southern 
border. He has repeatedly pushed for il-
legal immigrants to receive health ben-
efits on the taxpayers’ dime. 
As we are seeing Biden’s border crisis 
play out, it is even more alarming that 
one of his nominees would seek to 
incentivize 
illegal 
border 
crossings 
even more. I guess you could say this is 
all part of Biden’s ‘‘America Last’’ 
agenda, but as Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, Xavier Becerra would 
have the massive ability to impose a 
pro-abortion, anti-religious freedom, 
socialist healthcare agenda. His nomi-
nation highlights just how extreme— 
sadly, how extreme—the Biden admin-
istration really is. These views fail to 
represent the majority of Americans 
and have no place at the head of the 
largest Department of our executive 
branch. 
I urge my colleagues to consider the 
impact that Mr. Becerra would have as 
the head of Health and Human Services 
and to vote against his confirmation. 
Rather, we must stand up for life, for 
religious freedom, an ‘‘America First’’ 
agenda and against Mr. Becerra’s nomi-
nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the stat-
ed mission of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services is ‘‘to en-
hance the health and well-being of all 
Americans.’’ It is a laudable goal. The 
HHS Secretary is, thus, charged with 
overseeing all government healthcare 
and social services and protecting the 
health and the rights of the American 
people, a worthy goal, important job. 
Unfortunately, the history of the nomi-
nee before us, Mr. Xavier Becerra, 
poses grave concerns to our ability to 
carry out this goal and to our ability 
to oversee an Agency with such vast, 
far-reaching responsibilities. 
First, Mr. Becerra has repeatedly 
been on the record for wanting to 
eliminate private health insurance for 
millions of Americans even at a time 
when families need affordable, effec-
tive, and flexible healthcare and when 
healthcare workers need jobs perhaps 
now more than ever. What is more con-
cerning, however, is that, while in pub-
lic office, Mr. Becerra has repeatedly, 
deliberately 
undermined 
Americans’ 
constitutional rights and waged polit-
ical warfare on those who happen to 
disagree with his views. 
Take, for example, his views on abor-
tion. Instead of supporting laws that 
protect and sustain the life and health 
of American women and unborn chil-
dren, Mr. Becerra has supported laws 
that violently hurt them in his endors-
ing legal abortion up until and even 
during the moment of birth. 
As Attorney General of the State of 
California, 
he 
brought 
15 
felony 
charges against a reporter for exposing 
Planned Parenthood’s role in traf-
ficking the body parts of aborted ba-
bies—a prosecution that even the Los 
Angeles Times described as ‘‘disturbing 
overreach.’’ 
He defended a California law that re-
quired pro-life pregnancy centers to ad-
vertise for State-funded abortion clin-
ics, a law that so egregiously violated 
free speech that the Supreme Court 
ruled it unconstitutional, which, of 
course, it was and is. 
Not only that, but he has consist-
ently and flagrantly taken hostile ac-
tions against the free exercise of reli-
gion. Perhaps the worst example of this 
can be found in his legal persecution of 
the Little Sisters of the Poor. Now, 
this is a religious order of Catholic 
nuns that cares for the elderly poor. 
Becerra waged a lengthy, difficult bat-
tle to force the sisters—again, this is 
an order of nuns—to pay for abortion 
drugs and contraception in their health 
insurance plan even though doing so 
violates their beliefs and even though 
they are nuns. 
Even after the Supreme Court ruled 
for the Little Sisters of the Poor in 
2016 under a separate case and after the 
Trump administration granted them 
full conscience protections in 2017, Mr. 
Becerra still sued the Trump adminis-
tration in an attempt to pierce those 
protections. Again, he wasn’t com-
fortable with letting those protections 
stand in place with respect to the Lit-
tle Sisters of the Poor. No. He was de-
termined, even still, to make sure that 
they couldn’t live according to their 
own religious beliefs and their teach-
ings. 
During the pandemic, Becerra was 
the legal architect of some of the coun-
try’s most strident, sweeping, and bra-
zenly unconstitutional restrictions on 
church and on worship services, some 
of which were struck down by the Su-
preme Court last month, and he even

tried to prevent COVID relief funds 
from going to religious and other pri-
vate schools. 
Our Founders established the prin-
ciple of religious liberty—the natural 
right of all human beings to freely hold 
and live out their religious beliefs—be-
cause they understood that man is not 
free unless his conscience is free. They 
thought that this principle was so im-
portant, so fundamental, that it was 
the first freedom articulated in the 
very First Amendment to the Constitu-
tion. In doing so, they sought to defend 
and preserve the space of our deepest 
convictions, a space upon which a 
State cannot and must never encroach. 
In practice, that has meant that the 
government’s job is not to tell people 
what to believe or how to discharge 
their religious duties but to protect the 
space for all people of all faiths—and of 
no faith at all for that matter—to seek 
truth and to order their lives accord-
ingly. 
The American people deserve a leader 
at the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services who will uphold and 
strengthen this monumental tradition. 
They deserve a leader who will protect 
their fundamental rights, not trample 
them. Unfortunately, tragically, the 
record of this nominee demonstrates 
serious threats to the rights and the 
health and the well-being of the Amer-
ican people. They deserve better. In 
good conscience, I cannot support the 
nomination of Mr. Becerra. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it appears that President Biden 
arrived at the White House prepared 
and willing to grant himself and his ad-
ministration a mandate that American 
voters didn’t agree to give him. 
His party lost ground in the House, 
split the Senate, and maintained their 
trailing minority of governorships, but 
they seem to ignore that. In his first 50 
days, he signed 34 Executive orders— 
more than anyone in history. He dis-
mantled 
existing 
immigration 
con-
trols, threatened protections for small 
businesses against the radical climate 
agenda, and destroyed thousands of 
jobs and the potential for greater en-
ergy security promised by the Key-
stone XL Pipeline project. 
Meanwhile, 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues got busy laying the ground-
work to transform not only the Senate 
into a majoritarian institution but also 
to radically transform the country. 
They used budget reconciliation to ram 
through a $1.9 trillion bailout bill with-
out a single Republican vote—the larg-
est spending bill in our Nation’s his-
tory—and now they are reversing their 
own positions on the filibuster to avoid 
debate on radical immigration reform, 
the Equality Act, and an already infa-
mous bill that would federalize elec-
tions. They just don’t want to talk 
about these things—just do it. 
The more people learn about what 
the Biden White House is up to the 
more questions they have for those of 
us who represent them. 
Some of my Democratic friends in 
Tennessee say to me: I may have voted 
for Joe Biden, but I did not vote for 
this. 
They do not want to radically change 
the country. They do not want to be 
tied to legislation that has a nice- 
sounding name but that does the exact 
opposite of what the Biden administra-
tion would have you believe that it 
would accomplish. 
They have noticed that the Presi-
dent’s Cabinet picks have come to their 
confirmation hearings ready and will-
ing to move the goalposts away from 
the Constitution and the rule of law in 
order to accommodate their radical 
agenda. 
Last week, this body voted to dis-
charge 
from 
committee 
Xavier 
Becerra’s nomination to the Health 
and Human Services Secretary posi-
tion. I voted no, and I will vote no on 
his confirmation as well, not only be-
cause he is unqualified and has no ex-
perience in healthcare—Middle Ten-
nessee has more than 100,000 individ-
uals 
who 
are 
employed 
in 
the 
healthcare industry, and all, all are 
more qualified in healthcare than Xa-
vier Becerra—and not only because his 
radical views shock just about every-
one who speaks to me about him. Oh, 
yes, it was a topic of conversation at 
church on Sunday but also because, 
time and again, he has abused his 
power and weaponized the full force of 
the government against people whose 
deeply held, personal, political, and re-
ligious views don’t align with his own: 
submit, conform, or else. 
It is in the nature of our job as legis-
lators to recognize that, yes, elections 
do have consequences and that, yes, 
the President has a right to assemble 
his own Cabinet, but we cannot be ex-
pected to green-light a nominee who 
has so little patience for diversity—di-
versity of thought, diversity of opin-
ions—that his first and only instinct is 
to destroy the diversity: Barrel in. 
Burn it to the ground. Build it back in 
their own image. That is not what the 
American people want President Biden 
and his administration to do, but that 
is what they are getting with this 
nominee. 
I strongly oppose Xavier Becerra’s 
nomination, as I have from the start, 
and I would urge my colleagues to con-
sider what you will be approving if you 
vote in favor of this confirmation: radi-
cally anti-life, radically anti-religion, 
radically anti-border security, radi-
cally anti-free speech, radically un-
qualified to lead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
to oppose the nomination of Xavier 
Becerra for Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. 
There are, unfortunately, numerous 
nominees in the Biden administration 
who are either extreme or unqualified 
for the positions for which they have 
been nominated, but of all of those 
nominees, I believe Mr. Becerra is the 
single worst Cabinet nominee put for-
ward by Joe Biden to serve in the Cabi-
net. 
President Biden has told this country 
repeatedly that his top priority is de-
feating the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
Department of Health and Human 
Services is on the frontline in fighting 
COVID–19. Mr. Becerra, by any meas-
ure, is woefully unqualified to lead 
that Department. 
Mr. Becerra is not a doctor. Mr. 
Becerra is not a scientist. Mr. Becerra 
has no healthcare experience whatso-
ever. He has no medical experience 
whatsoever. He has no experience in vi-
rology. He has no experience with phar-
maceuticals. He has no experience run-
ning a State or local healthcare agen-
cy. He has no experience in logistics. 
The Department of HHS is in the proc-
ess of distributing and administering 
hundreds of millions of vaccines. Mr. 
Becerra has never so much as distrib-
uted french fries at a McDonald’s. 
Mr. Becerra’s only qualification and, 
indeed, the qualification that earned 
him this nomination is he is a radical, 
leftwing trial attorney. 
If a Republican President had nomi-
nated as the head of the Health and 
Human Services Agency someone with 
zero healthcare experience, zero med-
ical experience, zero pharmaceutical 
experience in the midst of a global pan-
demic, 
that 
Republican 
President 
would have been laughed out of the 
room. 
If a Republican President had done 
that, all of the Democrats would have 
been lined up here thundering: This is 
a President that doesn’t care about 
science. We would have heard Demo-
crats telling us: This is a President for 
whom defeating COVID–19 is not a pri-
ority, is not serious. 
‘‘This is a President,’’ our Demo-
cratic colleagues would have told us, 
‘‘who puts partisan priorities above de-
feating the public health menace of 
COVID–19. This is a President who is 
more concerned about appeasing his 
radical base than he is about pro-
tecting the public health and safety of 
Americans.’’ 
Had a Republican President nomi-
nated a nominee as unqualified as Mr. 
Becerra, I feel confident the Democrats 
would not have been alone. We would 
see 
multiple 
Republican 
Senators 
standing up, saying: No. We should ac-
tually have an HHS Secretary who 
knows something about science. We 
should have an HHS Secretary who 
knows 
something 
about 
medicine, 
something about pharmaceuticals. 
I would note, by the way, President 
Trump nominated two HHS Secre-
taries. The first, Dr. Tom Price, was a 
medical doctor; the second, Alex Azar, 
was president of a major pharma-
ceutical company in the United States. 
Both had years and even decades of 
healthcare experience. 
As best I can tell, Xavier Becerra’s 
only experience with healthcare is

suing the Little Sisters of the Poor. 
Frankly, it should be a joke. 
If a Republican President did this, a 
Republican Senate would discover the 
backbone to stand up and oppose it. 
And what I would say is sad is not a 
single Democrat is willing to stand up 
to Joe Biden and say: No. Try again. It 
is a pandemic. Over a half million 
Americans have died. How about put-
ting someone at HHS that knows some-
thing about healthcare? 
I will tell you right now, every Sen-
ator that supports this confirmation, 
when they go home, should be prepared 
to answer to their constituents—should 
be prepared to answer when their con-
stituents say: Why did you vote to con-
firm a guy at HHS who doesn’t know 
anything about science or healthcare 
or medicine? Why, in the middle of a 
pandemic, did you put in a radical, left-
wing trial lawyer instead of someone 
that could help us beat this pandemic? 
And for all the Democratic Senators 
who love to intone gravely ‘‘Listen to 
the science,’’ that is actually—that 
sentiment is correct. We should listen 
to the science, which means we should 
have someone leading HHS who knows 
something about science. 
My career, as a lawyer, has been liti-
gating cases before the U.S. Supreme 
Court. If a President asked me to lead 
the Department of HHS in the midst of 
a pandemic, I would tell that Presi-
dent: With all due respect, I don’t have 
the professional experience or expertise 
to do that job. There are other jobs for 
which I would be qualified, but in a 
pandemic, the Health and Human Serv-
ices Department should have someone 
who 
knows 
a 
damn 
thing 
about 
healthcare. 
Instead of knowing anything about 
science or medicine or viruses or virol-
ogy 
or 
immunizations, 
what 
Mr. 
Becerra does know about is persecuting 
citizens who don’t share his radical, 
leftwing ideology. 
Mr. Becerra, as attorney general of 
California, has demonstrated a con-
sistent pattern of contempt for pri-
vacy. While attorney general, he used 
his partisan power to overcome the in-
dividual privacy rights of California. 
As attorney general, he demanded that 
thousands of registered charities annu-
ally disclose to his offices the names 
and addresses of major donors, even 
though California law didn’t require 
that. But he used government power to 
violate their right to privacy. Then 
what did he do? Did he keep it private 
for law enforcement purposes to exam-
ine irregularities? No. Instead, he pub-
lished the information from nearly 
2,000 organizations, subjecting donors 
and those nonprofits to harassment 
and abuse. 
Healthcare issues are personal. They 
are sensitive. When you and I go to the 
doctor, we don’t expect our doctor to 
share our personal healthcare details 
with the world. Joe Biden has said to 
the American people: We are going to 
put someone in charge of the Health 
and Human Services Department who 
doesn’t care about privacy and has a 
record of ignoring your right to pri-
vacy. 
Later this year, the U.S. Supreme 
Court 
will 
decide 
whether 
Mr. 
Becerra’s invasion of privacy violated 
the First Amendment to the Constitu-
tion. While his disregard for privacy is 
before the Supreme Court, what did 
Joe Biden do? He said: Let’s put him in 
charge of healthcare in this country. 
A third reason Mr. Becerra’s nomina-
tion is so concerning concerns con-
science protections. 
The next HHS Secretary will be re-
sponsible for upholding the conscience 
protections that are written into Fed-
eral law to protect the rights of people 
of faith, whatever your faith—whether 
you are Christian or Jewish or Muslim 
or whatever your faith might be, the 
right of professionals, of citizens under 
the First Amendment to live according 
to their faith. 
But Mr. Becerra, as attorney general, 
aggressively defended a California law 
that forced pro-life groups to advertise 
for abortion, a law that the Supreme 
Court deemed unconstitutional under 
the First Amendment. 
Think about that for a second. He 
was so radical in going after and perse-
cuting conscience rights, he wanted 
pro-life groups to advertise for abor-
tion, and it took the U.S. Supreme 
Court to strike it down and say: That 
is unconstitutional. Joe Biden wants 
him to bring the same heavyhanded 
zealotry to the Health and Human 
Services Department. 
And Mr. Becerra has not shown that 
it is just free speech that he has antag-
onism to, but it is religious liberty as 
well. Mr. Becerra has defended Califor-
nia’s targeting of churches holding in-
door services. The State of California 
concluded that if you go to an indoor 
service at a church and you pray or you 
sing or you worship, you are a public 
health menace. But if you go to a pro-
test, if you go to other secular activi-
ties where the name of God is not in-
voked, then, magically, this virus is 
not contagious. It is ludicrous. It was 
facially absurd. It was driven by an un-
constitutional animus toward people of 
faith, and it took the U.S. Supreme 
Court to strike it down and to say the 
policy that Mr. Becerra was defending 
is unconstitutional. Government can-
not target people of faith. 
So you have got a nominee with no 
healthcare experience, no medical ex-
perience, no scientific experience, but a 
record of being a radical, persecuting 
those with whom he disagrees, who has 
repeatedly gone before the U.S. Su-
preme Court and lost over and over 
again for violating the First Amend-
ment, for violating free speech, for vio-
lating religious liberty. He is now cur-
rently before the Supreme Court for 
violating the privacy rights of Califor-
nians. 
Do you want an HHS Secretary who 
doesn’t 
respect 
your 
privacy, 
who 
doesn’t respect your free speech or reli-
gious liberty? Do you want an HHS 
Secretary who is not qualified to draw 
blood or give a shot, who doesn’t know 
how to distribute vaccines, who has 
never distributed anything? 
If nominations and confirmations 
were based on the merits, were based 
on qualification to serve, Mr. Becerra’s 
nomination would be rejected by this 
Senate by a vote of 100 to nothing. The 
fact that that is unlikely to happen 
and that every Democrat will march 
lockstep with the Biden administration 
to confirm a nominee who has no 
healthcare experience whatsoever in 
the midst of a global pandemic show 
just 
how 
profoundly 
partisan 
and 
radicalized today’s Democratic Party 
is. 
I believe all of us should be united in 
demanding a Health and Human Serv-
ices Secretary who is actually qualified 
to protect our health and defeat this 
pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to vote against this nomina-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise 
to speak this afternoon in support of 
the nomination of Xavier Becerra to 
serve as the next Secretary of Health 
and Human Services. 
President 
Biden 
nominated 
Mr. 
Becerra, who currently serves as the 
attorney general of the State of Cali-
fornia. Prior to his service in State 
government for the people of Cali-
fornia, he served in the House of Rep-
resentatives, representing a district in 
Los Angeles for 12 terms. He is some-
one I got to know in those years, espe-
cially in the debates about healthcare, 
which I will speak about in a moment. 
But when a person is nominated to be 
a member of any Cabinet, they bring 
with them not just their experience but 
their life story, and Attorney General 
Becerra’s story is a great American 
story. His own story and that of his 
family is a great American story, a 
story of hard work and sacrifice, over-
coming obstacles, achieving excellence, 
not only in his time in school and his 
academic record but also excellence in 
his public service as he discharges the 
duties of the offices that he has held. 
I mentioned that I knew him in the 
years we were debating healthcare here 
in Washington when he was a Member 
of the House. But just since his nomi-
nation, I met with him and questioned 
him closely on matters that are impor-
tant to me and the people of Pennsyl-
vania. I also asked him questions in 
not one but two—two—hearings be-
cause he just happens to be nominated 
to a Cabinet position where the con-
firmation is considered by two Senate 
committees, the Finance Committee 
and the Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee, so I had the 
chance to question him in both hear-
ings, both committees. 
Through 
these 
conversations 
and 
based upon his long and distinguished 
record of public service, Attorney Gen-
eral Becerra has demonstrated that he

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1594 
March 17, 2021 
is the kind of leader our Nation needs 
at HHS during this challenging time. 
He is a proven leader who spent his 
career fighting to expand healthcare— 
to expand it—protecting both patients 
and 
consumers 
and 
working 
to 
strengthen both Medicare and Med-
icaid. 
As a Congressman, as I mentioned, he 
was instrumental in drafting and work-
ing to pass the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act, the so-called ACA. 
And as California’s attorney general, 
he has led the fight to protect it. 
Now, my view of the disagreement on 
the other side of the aisle is just that. 
This is someone who worked as a Mem-
ber of Congress and then has worked as 
attorney general to pass and then up-
hold the ACA. 
On the other side of the aisle, they 
don’t like that because they have been 
committed as a party here in the Sen-
ate and in the House—both Republican 
caucuses have been committed to two 
things on healthcare: destroying the 
ACA, which means destroying all pro-
tections 
for 
preexisting 
conditions 
and—it is important to add this—they 
have been dedicated to ending—not 
limiting, 
not 
cutting 
back—ending 
Medicaid expansion, which, of course, 
accounted for most of the healthcare 
gains. Millions of Americans have 
healthcare today because of the expan-
sion of Medicaid. It is the official posi-
tion of the Republican Party to end 
that—to say to all those millions of 
Americans: 
You 
don’t 
deserve 
healthcare coverage. That is their posi-
tion based upon what they have sup-
ported in bill after bill that came be-
fore the Senate. We know that. That is 
a fact. And until they move away from 
that position, they will try to take 
down the nomination of or oppose any-
one who wants to uphold the ACA, up-
hold all protections for preexisting 
conditions, uphold and support the ex-
pansion of Medicaid, one of the best ex-
pansions of healthcare in American 
history, not just recent history, in all 
of American history. 
So I would support Attorney General 
Becerra just based upon what he has 
done on healthcare because it happens 
to be in the best interests of the Amer-
ican people to expand healthcare and 
the best interests of the people I rep-
resent. 
I don’t come across many people in 
Pennsylvania coming up to me, saying: 
I want you to lessen the number of peo-
ple in the United States or in my State 
that have healthcare. I want you to cut 
that back. I want you to cut back on 
the Medicaid Program—which folks on 
the other side of the aisle want to do as 
well. 
They not only want to end Medicaid 
expansion—end 
it 
completely—they 
want to cut the Medicaid Program by 
hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 
years. That is their official position. It 
has been their position for years to cut 
the Medicaid Program and to end Med-
icaid expansion—cut the Medicaid Pro-
gram by hundreds of billions of dollars. 
So if you are against that, they are 
going to be opposing you, whether it is 
for confirmation or anything else, be-
cause they are the party that wants to 
cut Medicaid, not by $100 billion over 10 
years, not by $200 billion or $300 billion. 
Look at their budgets year after year. 
They want to cut it $500 billion or $700 
billion. One year they even proposed— 
here in the debates about the budgets, 
one year they even proposed cutting 
the Medicaid Program by $1 trillion. 
That was the official position of the 
Republican Party. So if you want to 
oppose them on that, then they will try 
to take you down. 
The Medicaid Program, by the way, 
pays 
for 
half—almost 
half—of 
the 
births in America. Of the babies born 
in America, almost half of those births 
are paid for by Medicaid—the Medicaid 
Program—the program they want to 
cut by $500 billion, at least, and some-
times a lot more than that. 
So that is why they are against him, 
because they want to cut back on 
healthcare. 
Now, his leadership of this Agency 
could not come at a more important 
time. Our Nation is facing the greatest 
public health crisis in more than a cen-
tury, since the horror of 1918. Now we 
are facing a similar challenge. 
We also have a jobs crisis. So the 
faster we put this pandemic behind us, 
the better it is for creating a lot more 
jobs and lifting our economy out of the 
ditch that it has been in the last year. 
So we need a strong leader at HHS. 
We need someone who has the experi-
ence, the integrity, to lead us in that 
Agency to help guide us out of the cri-
sis. I am confident—very confident— 
that Xavier Becerra is that leader, and 
I urge my colleagues to vote in support 
of his nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The junior Senator from 
Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, the first thing I would like to do 
is correct what my colleague from 
Pennsylvania said with regard to pre-
existing conditions. 
I was here last year. I brought to the 
floor a bill that would say it didn’t 
matter what the Supreme Court did; 
we would make sure that we could keep 
preexisting conditions if the Supreme 
Court declared that the Affordable 
Care Act was not constitutional. The 
Democrats blocked it. 
I have been up here 2 years, and I 
have never seen once my Republican 
colleagues want to reduce spending for 
Medicaid. 
What I do think is unfair is, in my 
State of Florida, what money we re-
ceive from the Federal Government is 
significantly less per person than what 
a State like New York has. So I would 
like changes to the Medicaid Program. 
I would like it to be a fair program in 
which States like Florida will get 
treated just as well as States like New 
York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 798 
Madam President, I rise today to dis-
cuss an insane issue in the Democrats’ 
COVID spending bill that we need to 
fix. 
Tucked into the Democratic bill is a 
provision to give $1,400 stimulus checks 
to inmates. That is right. As our Na-
tion faces a public health crisis and a 
crippling debt crisis, Democrats are 
handing out stimulus checks with your 
tax dollars to Federal inmates who 
don’t pay income taxes, have all their 
needs—food and medical expenses in-
cluded—paid for by taxpayers, and they 
do nothing to stimulate the economy. 
It simply doesn’t make sense. 
My friends and colleagues, Senators 
BILL CASSIDY, TOM COTTON, and TED 
CRUZ, tried to fix this by introducing 
an amendment to strip this out of the 
Democratic bill, but the Democrats 
wouldn’t have it. 
Senate 
Democrats 
voted 
unani-
mously to block the passage of that 
good amendment and chose instead to 
waste even more taxpayer dollars by 
sending $1,400 checks to inmates. 
Let’s talk about what that means for 
American taxpayers. There are nearly 
1.5 million State and Federal inmates 
incarcerated in Federal prisons across 
the United States. These are people 
convicted of committing serious crimes 
and victimizing their fellow Ameri-
cans. 
Under this bill the Democrats passed, 
American taxpayers are on the hook 
for $1,400 checks to some of the most 
heinous people we have ever seen. I am 
talking about people like the racist 
Charleston Church shooter, Dylann 
Roof; serial rapist and predator, Larry 
Nassar; aspiring terrorist, Muhammad 
Dakhlalla, who tried to join ISIS and is 
now in prison in Georgia; convicted se-
rial killer and rapist, Mark Goudeau, 
who is on death row in Arizona; con-
victed cop killer, Michael Addison, who 
is on death row in New Hampshire; and 
the monster who killed 17 innocent 
Floridians in Parkland at Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb-
ruary 14, 2018. 
How could anyone—anyone—possibly 
justify sending checks to these people? 
If we send $1,400 checks to all State 
and Federal inmates, all 1.5 million, 
that is more than $2 billion—$2 billion 
in taxpayer money going to stimulus 
checks for inmates. 
That is $2 billion that could be used 
to help our small businesses recover; $2 
billion that could be used to enhance 
vaccine development and distribution 
so that more Americans can get the 
shots they need to move us forward and 
away from this virus; $2 billion that 
could be used to pay down some of our 
massive debt. There are so many posi-
tive uses for these funds that provide a 
real return for American taxpayers, 
but sending them to inmates isn’t one 
of them. It is an unjustifiable expense 
that does nothing to fight COVID–19. 
Today, I ask for full support of this 
body to strip this bad policy from law. 
We cannot forget that America is in a

debt crisis. I have been talking about it 
for a while, and I won’t stop talking 
about it because it is a crisis my Demo-
cratic colleagues still don’t seem to 
understand. 
Right now, our Nation is headed to-
ward $30 trillion in debt. Think about 
that—$30 trillion. The U.S. debt will be 
equal to $240,000 per taxpayer. That is 
insane. And what are the Democrats 
doing to rein in this unsustainable 
debt? Absolutely nothing. 
In fact, the Democrats’ wasteful and 
untargeted spending bill, which will 
raise the debt from $28 trillion to $30 
trillion contains loads of handouts and 
provisions, just like this one, that 
recklessly spend on their priorities un-
related to COVID. 
That is why I sent a letter to the 
Biden administration on Monday, urg-
ing him to rescind hundreds of billions 
in waste from this bill and create a tar-
geted approach Americans truly need. 
It is clear that Democrats are living 
in a fantasy land where debt doesn’t 
matter, spending has no consequences, 
and inflation is impossible. Of course, 
reasonable Americans know that is not 
true. 
The Biden administration needs to 
take immediate action to request the 
rescission of the non-COVID-related, 
liberal agenda-driven, and wasteful 
funding found throughout this bill. 
So I will keep fighting to cut down 
on this liberal wish list. Today, we can 
start that important work and pass my 
bill to not only save $2 billion from 
going to inmates who have no need for 
the money, but also show the American 
people that Congress is committed to 
remaining fully accountable to the 
American people for the proper stew-
ardship of tax dollars. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 798, in-
troduced earlier today. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
Madam 
President, 
today the Republicans are showing 
some real chutzpa. 
On this issue, Republicans were for it 
before they were against it. Today, 
they claim to want to target prisoners. 
The real harm they are doing is to in-
nocent children and families. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The junior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, it is hard to imagine that my col-
league just rose in opposition to this 
good bill. 
Let’s be clear. By objecting to this 
bill, Democrats are standing in full 
support of spending $2 billion to send 
$1,400 checks to inmates. Democrats 
want to spend $2 billion in taxpayer 
money to send checks to people in pris-
on, convicted of committing serious 
crimes and victimizing their fellow 
Americans. 
That means Democrats are saying 
that they want American taxpayers to 
be on the hook for $1,400 checks to 
some of the most heinous criminals we 
have ever seen—people like Dylann 
Roof and the Parkland shooter. 
How 
can 
anyone 
justify 
sending 
checks to these people? Let’s remem-
ber, inmates don’t pay income taxes. 
They have all their needs, food and 
medical expenses included, paid for by 
taxpayers. They don’t do anything to 
stimulate our economy. 
I do hope my colleague will recon-
sider his objection and stand with me 
in putting accountability to American 
taxpayers over this insane policy that 
does nothing but throw $2 billion we 
don’t have out the window. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ST. PATRICK’S DAY 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
wish you and I wish everyone a happy 
St. Patrick’s Day. It is a big day for 
celebration up in Boston and all of 
Massachusetts and all across the coun-
try and the world. On St. Patrick’s 
Day, everyone is Irish. So I wish every-
one a happy St. Patrick’s Day today. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Madam President, right now on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate is a reason not 
to be so happy, and that is why I look 
forward to very soon casting my vote 
to confirm Xavier Becerra to lead the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, one of the most qualified and 
forward-thinking minds that will have 
ever run the Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
But today, Republicans are using this 
confirmation vote to continue their 
agenda of obstruction, deflecting at-
tention away from the nominee who 
will be the head of the chief Federal 
Agency responding to the coronavirus 
crisis—all to revive an unnecessary, 
blatantly political debate on reproduc-
tive rights. This ridiculous delay tactic 
only highlights how out of step with 
the American people the Senate Repub-
licans are. 
Their anti-choice, anti-woman, and 
anti-health rhetoric is on full display 
here on the Senate floor, and, sadly, it 
is not new. They want to roll back Roe 
v. Wade. They want to criminalize 
abortion care. They want the govern-
ment to control women and their bod-
ies. They want to roll back title IX 
protections for women on university 
campuses and completely gut the title 
X program to fund critical healthcare 
providers like Planned Parenthood. 
Republicans have put in place an 
anti-choice majority on the U.S. Su-
preme Court by confirming Justices 
Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and 
illegitimately 
filling 
Justice 
Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg’s seat with Amy Coney 
Barrett. If there ever were a reason to 
abolish the filibuster, it is to ensure 
that we pass legislation to expand the 
Supreme Court so it cannot overturn 
Roe v. Wade and set us back decades in 
the fight for equal access to healthcare 
in our country. 
But here today, the Republicans are 
attempting to disrupt the nomination 
of our Secretary of Health and Human 
Services with a craven political play to 
their base at the expense of the health 
of Americans. They would rather play 
politics than confirm President Biden’s 
Cabinet nominees. They would rather 
remain beholden to the far-right’s in-
terest groups than do the work the 
American people sent us here to do. 
For the past 4 years, the Trump ad-
ministration emboldened these groups 
with dangerous rhetoric and far-right 
policies. But in November, how did the 
American people respond? They voted 
him out and gave the Democrats the 
Senate majority. Americans entrusted 
us to serve them, not fringe interest 
groups who want to turn back the 
clocks on healthcare and women’s 
rights. That is why I stand on the floor 
of the U.S. Senate today to say abor-
tion is healthcare. 
We cannot stand for any more dis-
parities, delays, or denials. More than 
ever in this country, we need to stand 
up and raise our voices against the Re-
publican’s work to restrict access to 
reproductive health services. We have a 
fight ahead of us—a fight to protect re-
productive freedom, a fight to make 
sure that birth control is affordable 
and available, and a fight for title X to 
ensure that low-income patients re-
ceive quality family planning and re-
productive health services. 
Voters expect the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration to take bold steps to pro-
tect and expand access to reproductive 
healthcare and freedoms, to ensure 
that every person has the fundamental 
right to make their own healthcare de-
cisions, and they expect it because 
they want it. 
Public support for Roe v. Wade is at 
a record high. Seventy-seven percent of 
Americans support that historic Su-
preme Court decision. That goes be-
yond a simple majority to an over-
whelming consensus. A couple of years 
ago, one analysis of polling found that 
there is not a single State in the 
United States where a majority of vot-
ers support ‘‘making abortion illegal in 
all circumstances.’’ The American peo-
ple have moved past that debate that 
Republicans seem committed to resus-
citating on the floor today. They are 
on the wrong side of history and the 
wrong side of the American people. 
So as Republicans try to hijack this 
confirmation vote on Xavier Becerra,

all I can say is, enough. Enough with 
the era of extreme bodily discrimina-
tion. Enough with outside entities tak-
ing control over what a woman can and 
cannot do with her body. Enough with 
mounting 
barriers 
to 
reproductive 
services and birth control. Enough 
with criminalization of abortion care. 
Enough with creating roadblocks for 
poor women, immigrant women, and 
women of color to get equal access to 
healthcare. Enough with this offensive 
debate steeped in misogyny, partisan-
ship, and tyranny. 
It is time to guarantee quality, af-
fordable healthcare regardless of race, 
status, or gender. It is time to rectify 
the healthcare and reproductive injus-
tices that have cost too many lives for 
too long. We must move away from the 
antiquated and ideological debate over 
women’s 
bodies 
and 
recognize 
the 
spaces in which our government can 
promote equity. We can reshape policy 
to reflect the constitutional rights of 
all people. 
By delaying Xavier Becerra’s nomi-
nation to be Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, Republicans seem 
more interested in denying the health 
rights of half of Americans than in pro-
tecting the health of all Americans. 
Plain and simple, Xavier Becerra is 
exceedingly qualified to be our next 
Health and Human Services Secretary. 
He has proven that he prioritizes 
science and facts, believes in each per-
son’s right to make health and medical 
decisions about their own bodies, and is 
dedicated to fighting for those most 
vulnerable in our society. His record 
and support for reproductive freedom 
reflect the will of the vast majority of 
Americans who support legal access to 
abortion. He is committed to reproduc-
tive freedom and understands the im-
portance of ensuring people have access 
to the accurate information they need 
to make the best decisions for their 
lives and for their families. 
Xavier Becerra knows what is at 
stake, and I have the utmost con-
fidence that he will lead with convic-
tion, with compassion, and with care, 
and is ready to undo the damage that 
has been done by his predecessors. 
As America continues to battle the 
coronavirus pandemic, his confirma-
tion is long overdue. I am proud to sup-
port Xavier Becerra today as Secretary 
of Health and Human Services. He will 
be one of the greatest Secretaries our 
country has ever known. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from New Jersey. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss yes-
terday’s report from the Intelligence 
Committee, a public report, which con-
firmed what we all suspected last year: 
that the Russian Federation favored 
Donald Trump’s reelection and sought 
to influence the outcome by amplifying 
attacks on Joe Biden and his family. 
While the scale of interference appears 
to be less than what we saw in 2016, the 
receptiveness of Trump’s inner circle 
appears to have been about the same. 
They were open for business. 
I am not here to relitigate the 2016 or 
2020 elections; I am here to raise my 
concern with the fact that, for two 
election cycles in a row now, the Re-
publican Party’s nominee for President 
sought to normalize foreign inter-
ference in our elections. And I want to 
be clear. It is wrong, it is hostile, it is 
undemocratic, and it must stop if you 
want the American people to have the 
confidence in the legitimacy and the 
credibility of our elections going for-
ward. 
This is not about party; this is about 
the durability of our democracy. Ev-
eryone in this body has an important 
role to play in rejecting foreign inter-
ference and restoring trust in our elec-
tion process. 
While the contents of the report 
came as no surprise, its findings were 
nonetheless breathtaking. Our intel-
ligence 
community 
is 
highly 
con-
fident—the highest assessment they 
have on any given issue—in its assess-
ment that Vladimir Putin was involved 
in 
the 
operation 
whereby 
Andrii 
Derkach and Konstantin Kilimnik suc-
cessfully 
manipulated 
President 
Trump’s inner circle, including his per-
sonal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. 
Thankfully, the American people had 
better sense than Mr. Giuliani and re-
jected the Kremlin-backed lies about 
Joe Biden and his family. That, how-
ever, does not diminish the fact that 
the Russian Government undertook 
this effort and the former President 
welcomed it. The Russian interference 
detailed in this report occurred at the 
very same time the Trump administra-
tion sought to publicly downplay the 
role played by Russia. 
This report was mandated by Con-
gress and for good reason. Americans 
deserve to know exactly who is inter-
fering in our democracy and how. As I 
said before, everyone has a role to play, 
including the American people. We 
have to encourage Americans to prac-
tice better cyber security and to scru-
tinize the information they see on the 
web. Carefully examining social media 
posts before sharing them must become 
the new hallmark of a patriotic, active, 
and informed citizenry. And our social 
media companies must do a better job 
stopping the proliferation of foreign 
disinformation on their platforms. 
The health of our democracy depends 
on this vigilance. The Kremlin will 
continue to attack our elections and 
seek to sow divisions among us. We 
have a responsibility to resist this in-
terference and not make their job any 
easier. 
We live in a media environment 
where Donald Trump and his Repub-
lican allies continue to this day to pro-
mote 
unhinged 
conspiracy 
theories 
that the election was stolen. The intel-
ligence report confirms this is not true. 
Some Republican officials have pro-
moted wild conspiracy theories that 
China 
supported 
Democratic 
cam-
paigns. The intelligence report con-
firms this was not true. 
Former President Trump and his al-
lies still assert that Venezuela manipu-
lated voting machines. A companion 
report by the Department of Justice 
and Homeland Security confirmed this 
is not true. 
We must come to terms with the fact 
that while Russia has aggressively pro-
moted disinformation in our country, 
the most pernicious engine of lies in 
the United States is cast by the former 
President himself. 
Knowing the facts sets a foundation 
for action, and I look forward to engag-
ing with this administration on meas-
ures to respond to our intelligence 
community’s findings. There should be 
sanctions required in response to this 
interference, and the administration 
should move quickly to impose them. 
I welcome the approach thus far by 
the Biden administration as it crafts a 
Russia policy that calls out Kremlin 
aggression when it happens and takes 
strong measures in response. The sanc-
tions imposed in response to the 
Navalny assassination attempt dem-
onstrate that such reckless and dan-
gerous behavior will not be tolerated. 
And our efforts to hold the Kremlin ac-
countable will include close coordina-
tion with our European allies. 
The package of sanctions announced 
on March 2 shows how committed the 
Biden administration is to confronting 
Kremlin aggression. This type of rigor 
in the development of sanctions pack-
ages is a welcome reminder of how our 
government should work. The Navalny 
sanctions were a good first step, and I 
look forward to soon seeing the results 
of the administration’s review of Rus-
sia policy. In my view, we need a strat-
egy that accomplishes four main goals. 
One, limiting the Kremlin’s ability to 
interfere in our democracy as well as 
those of our allies and partners. This 
includes 
a 
comprehensive 
plan 
to 
counter Russian-generated propaganda 
and corruption around the world. 
Two, standing up for our friends in 
Ukraine who are literally on the 
frontlines battling Kremlin aggression. 
They need our diplomatic support in 
Europe. They need our security assist-
ance to defend themselves. They need 
our encouragement to reform demo-
cratic institutions. I hope that Presi-
dent Biden will soon speak with Presi-
dent Zelensky to send these important 
messages. 
Three, we have a responsibility to en-
gage with the Russian Government 
when it is in our national security in-
terests. I supported the extension of 
the New START agreement and urge 
the administration to continue to ad-
vance arms control policies that ad-
vance stability and our national secu-
rity. 
Finally, our Russia policy must ex-
tend a hand to the Russian people, 
many of whom have courageously 
turned out by the thousands in opposi-
tion to Putin and his government. 
Their struggle for democracy is theirs,

not ours, but we must make clear that 
our disagreements are not with them 
but with Vladimir Putin and his cor-
rupt, autocratic regime. 
Defending our elections isn’t just 
about strong cyber measures, pro-
tecting the ballot box, and promoting 
better practices on social media. It is 
about having a foreign policy that 
clearly communicates our values and 
interests, one that leaves no room for 
debate over the openness of any Amer-
ican President to foreign interference. 
It is about a foreign policy that recog-
nizes how the Kremlin’s efforts to 
weaken democracy in Ukraine or in 
other European countries ultimately 
threatens 
democracy 
here 
in 
the 
United States. It is about a foreign pol-
icy that works with allies and part-
ners, not one that denigrates them at 
every turn. 
The intelligence community is get-
ting better at detecting and guarding 
against interference, but we must re-
main vigilant. Russia and other foreign 
actors will continue to attack our 
democratic process. Their tactics may 
evolve, but their intentions remain the 
same, and we need to stay one step 
ahead of them. 
The Biden administration is off to a 
good start in defending our democracy. 
As chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, I look forward to working 
together to advance policies that re-
flect America’s time-honored demo-
cratic values both at him and abroad. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Madam President, parliamentary in-
quiry: Is there a time limit that we are 
in the midst of? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in 
postcloture on the Becerra nomination. 
Each Senator has up to 1 hour. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Further parliamen-
tary inquiry: Is there a limit on time 
divided by side or is the floor open re-
gardless? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The floor 
is open to any Senator who seeks rec-
ognition. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Madam 
President, 
just 
switching 
very briefly, I want to urge my col-
leagues to join me in support of the 
nomination of Xavier Becerra to serve 
as Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
I consider Mr. Becerra a friend. I had 
the privilege of serving with him in the 
House of Representatives. In fact, we 
both came to Congress at the same 
time, a time, I might add, when there 
were far fewer Latinos elected to Fed-
eral office than we have today. 
As a member of the Ways and Means 
Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Becerra 
frequently spoke up for the many 
Americans 
left 
behind 
by 
our 
healthcare system: seniors facing sky- 
high prescription drug bills, patients 
with preexisting conditions, children, 
and the working poor. 
Furthermore, he played an active 
role in the effort to pass the Affordable 
Care Act, a landmark law that since 
2010 has changed the lives of millions of 
Americans in New Jersey and across 
the Nation for the better. 
As California’s attorney general, no 
one has fought harder to protect the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
than 
Xavier 
Becerra. And if confirmed to this posi-
tion, no one will work harder to pro-
tect and improve access to healthcare 
than he will. 
As the first Secretary of Health and 
Human Services of Latino descent, I 
know that Mr. Becerra will focus a 
great deal on addressing the health dis-
parities that are harming so many 
lower income and minority commu-
nities nationwide, disparities we saw 
played out over the past year as 
COVID–19 claimed a disproportionate 
number of Black and Brown lives. 
Mr. Becerra will also work to undo 
the damage wrought by the Trump ad-
ministration to our healthcare system, 
from weakening nursing home stand-
ards that left seniors more vulnerable 
in this pandemic to allowing health in-
surers to, once again, sell shoddy, 
skimpy plans to consumers that failed 
to protect them from massive medical 
bills. 
And, finally, I want to address some 
of the criticisms I have heard from my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
regarding Mr. Becerra’s qualifications. 
The notion that Mr. Becerra has no 
managerial experience is laughable, 
given that as California’s attorney gen-
eral, he has successfully led the second 
largest Justice Department in the Na-
tion, second only to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice. 
And it is not lost on me that those 
questioning Mr. Becerra’s credentials 
are the very same colleagues who 
claim that Congressman Tom Price’s 
background as a doctor qualified him 
to lead an Agency that touches the 
lives of every single person in our great 
land. Well, he was a disaster and did 
not last a full year as Secretary of 
HHS. And the immediate past Sec-
retary was a lawyer who did a good job 
in his pharmaceutical firm of dramati-
cally pushing up insulin prices. 
So I am confident that both Mr. 
Becerra’s passion for healthcare issues, 
as demonstrated throughout his tenure 
in Congress, and his record as Califor-
nia’s attorney general will serve him 
well as Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. 
I urge my colleagues to support his 
nomination. He will lead this Agency 
with integrity and, most importantly, 
make the health of the American peo-
ple his No. 1 priority. 
With that, I yield the floor and thank 
my colleague from Ohio for indulging 
my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise 
to speak in favor of Xavier Becerra, as 
Senator MENENDEZ just did. 
Like Senator MENENDEZ, when Xa-
vier and I came, we all were in the first 
class in 1992 together. I consider him a 
friend also and have admired the work 
that he did as a Member of Congress, as 
attorney general, and the work that he 
will do at HHS. 
In the middle of the worst health cri-
sis of our lifetime, we need someone 
leading this Department who under-
stands the importance of public health 
and who will work to build a stronger, 
more affordable healthcare system for 
the 
future. 
That 
is 
what 
Xavier 
Becerra will do. 
He has the experience for this job. As 
Senator MENENDEZ pointed out, he ran 
the Nation’s second largest law firm. 
He helped pass the Affordable Care Act, 
as a Member of the House, that ex-
panded coverage to millions of Ohioans 
and tens of millions of Americans. 
I think the Republican opposition, all 
partisan opposition, to Attorney Gen-
eral Becerra for Secretary of HHS, as 
Senator CASEY pointed out, is all about 
their opposition to the Affordable Care 
Act, their opposition to expansion of 
Medicaid. I heard one Senator after an-
other say their State isn’t treated 
right by Medicaid, but they didn’t even 
expand Medicaid in many of those 
States. 
As State attorney general, he took 
on tobacco companies, drug companies, 
opioid manufacturers, and polluters. 
That is another reason Republicans op-
pose him, because he took on their big-
gest contributors and their sponsors 
and the people they come to the Senate 
and fight for. That willingness to stand 
up to big drug companies is going to be 
more important than ever in the years 
ahead. 
The cost of prescription drugs eats 
away at the budget of seniors and fami-
lies in Cleveland and Akron and Mans-
field and Youngstown and Dayton. I 
look forward to working with future 
Secretary Becerra to bring down those 
drug prices. I also hope we can work to-
gether to expand the Affordable Care 
Act and to make it work even better 
for the families. 
We started this month, and the Pre-
siding Officer from Wisconsin was a 
part of this, with the American Rescue 
Plan. People buying healthcare in the 
ACA exchanges are going to have lower 
premiums because of the rescue plan. 
Mr. Becerra will work to undo the 
vast disparities in healthcare in our 
country. This pandemic has been the 
great revealer. It has shown how un-
equal access to care and pollution and 
biases in the system and so much else 
have hurt the health of Black and 
Brown Americans for generations. 
We need to start with getting accu-
rate data on how different commu-
nities have been hurt by this pandemic, 
something I have pushed for over the 
past year and something I know will be 
a priority to the new Secretary of 
Health and Human Services. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
confirming him so he can work to help 
get every American vaccinated, to ex-
pand PPE and COVID testing supplies, 
and to build a stronger healthcare sys-
tem for the future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1598 
March 17, 2021 
CONFIRMATION OF KATHERINE C. TAI 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, for 
decades, Ohio workers have watched 
the spread of a corporate business 
model where companies shut down pro-
duction in Toledo or Dayton or Gallip-
olis or Youngstown. They collected a 
tax break to move jobs to Mexico or 
China where they can exploit workers 
only to sell their products back into 
the United States. Ohioans live with 
those consequences every day. 
Last week, 81 workers in Bucyrus, 
OH, had their jobs outsourced to China, 
where GE-Savant moved production of 
its high-efficiency light bulbs overseas. 
Now, 81 union workers are facing tough 
conversations at the kitchen tables: 
How will their families survive; will 
they fall behind on their rent or their 
mortgage; do they move away with 
their kids; will their kids have to 
change schools—all those decisions 
that families have to make when work-
ers or when plants shut down and move 
overseas. 
The Presiding Officer from Wisconsin 
has been involved in this fight ever 
since her career began in the House 20- 
plus years ago, and I have worked 
alongside with her to make sure that 
we have a different trade policy. But 
when one production line closes, the 
ripple effect extends, as we know, to 
the whole community, to other work-
ers and communities in the supply 
chain. 
Yesterday, people in Northeast Ohio, 
in the Cleveland area, woke up to head-
lines about yet another American cor-
poration deciding to build things in 
Mexico instead of Ohio with Ford 
breaking its promise to invest $900 mil-
lion in Avon Lake. 
I got a call 2 days ago from a 
smalltown mayor, John Hunter, mayor 
of Sheffield Lake, OH, a longtime 
Ford—he was a Ford worker, retired, 
now mayor of Sheffield Village. He 
talked about how Ford had promised, 
at the bargaining table in 2019, that 
they would invest $900 million in this 
Avon Lake plant. Ohioans are tired of 
watching corporation after corporation 
abandon the workers and communities 
that have made their businesses suc-
cessful. 
We are being told that production of 
cheap, simple products will be shipped 
overseas, while innovative, high-value 
products will be made in the United 
States by American workers. We see in 
Bucyrus, we see in Avon Lake that 
that is just not true, and we are sick of 
it. Our trade policy has to change. 
That is why today was a good day for 
this country. Katherine Tai was con-
firmed by this body 98 to nothing. She 
understands trade policy. She is the 
right leader to take us in a new direc-
tion on trade with American workers 
at the center. She is a serious expert. 
She is respected on both sides of the 
aisle. We saw that in that vote today. 
She has a proven track record of mak-
ing progress for workers. 
Last year, I voted for a trade agree-
ment for the first time ever in my ca-
reer because of our work with Senator 
WYDEN to fix the Trump administra-
tion’s corporate trade agreement. He 
said it was a new NAFTA. It was really 
a tired, old, mostly the same NAFTA, 
rebranded as USMCA. We went to 
work. We secured groundbreaking new 
worker protections. Katherine Tai was 
one of the key policymakers who 
worked with us to make that happen. 
She was in the negotiations. She was in 
the discussions. She helped Senator 
WYDEN and I make this a much better 
bill that people, like a whole lot of us, 
as progressives, pro-worker Senators, 
could vote for. 
Her work helped us make the first 
improvement to enforcing labor stand-
ards in our trade agreements enforce-
able, serious labor standards, since we 
have been negotiating them. 
We know why companies close fac-
tories in Ohio and open them in Mex-
ico. They can pay lower wages. They 
can take advantage of workers who 
don’t have rights. American workers 
can’t compete. We get a race to the 
bottom on wages and benefits. 
The only way of stopping it is raising 
labor standards in every country we 
trade with and making sure those labor 
standards are enforced. 
That is what Katherine Tai will do. 
She will enforce the laws we already 
have. She will stand up for American 
workers. She will fight for American 
businesses when countries cheat the 
rules. She will work with us to level 
the playing field so steelworkers and 
autoworkers and communication work-
ers in Ohio and Wisconsin and all over 
the country can compete. 
She won’t allow corporate lobbyists 
to write trade agreements. We have 
seen it. Since I came to the Congress, 
we have seen it with NAFTA. We have 
seen it with CAFTA. We have seen it 
with PNTR. We have seen it with 
agreement after agreement after agree-
ment: Corporate lobbyists write trade 
agreements. Workers are locked out of 
the room. 
Now, with U.S. Trade Rep Tai’s con-
firmation—the nominee, of course—I 
asked her what she will do to start to 
regain the trust of Americans in trade. 
She said: 
You start by listening. 
She then talked about the Mahoning 
Valley, Youngstown area in my State, 
listening to and understanding the con-
cerns of communities that have gotten 
hurt over and over. 
The administration’s outline for its 
2021 agenda, trade agenda, which Miss 
Tai will be charged with carrying out, 
says that ‘‘trade policy should respect 
the dignity of work.’’ 
Trade policy should respect the dignity of 
work and value Americans as workers and 
wage earners. 
Imagine that; that our trade policy, 
never before have we seen this respect-
ing the dignity of work and valuing 
Americans as workers and wage earn-
ers. That is the kind of thinking we 
need leading our trade policy. 
As the first woman of color to ever 
serve as the President’s chief trade ad-
viser, Katherine Tai knows how impor-
tant it is for the people in the room 
making trade decisions to actually re-
flect, to actually reflect the diverse 
workforce that our trade policy affects. 
We know one good appointment and 
one good provision won’t stop out-
sourcing, but I am always going to be 
straight with American workers. We 
have come a long, long way, but we 
have a long, long way to go to undo the 
damage our trade policies have done 
over the past three decades. 
As the Presiding Officer, I have stood 
up to Presidents of both parties on 
trade throughout my career. That is 
not going to change. One of my proud-
est votes was one of my first votes, and 
that was against the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
I will continue to watch closely what 
this administration does. If they show 
any hint of reverting back to the old 
way of doing things, of letting corpora-
tions dictate trade policy at the ex-
pense of workers, they will hear about 
it from me. This is going to be a con-
stant effort over many years. 
As thrilled as I am with Katherine 
Tai, we know we still have a job to do 
to reorient trade agreements and trade 
laws that are a priority; that our em-
phasis no longer is corporations, but it 
is American workers. It has to be cou-
pled with real investment in the com-
munities that have been hollowed out 
because of Washington’s and Wall 
Street’s past mistakes. It has to be 
paired with an overhaul of our Tax 
Code to end, once and for all, the tax 
breaks paid for by Ohioans and others 
to send production overseas. 
Trade doesn’t happen in a vacuum. 
Our policies must work together to cre-
ate a global market where workers are 
treated with dignity; they are safe on 
the job; they are paid fair wages; they 
are able to bargain collectively; they 
are able to bargain collectively for bet-
ter pay and benefits. 
When you love this country, you 
fight for the people who make it work. 
That is what Katherine Tai will do. 
I thank my colleagues for the strong 
vote in support of her confirmation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Maryland. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today in strong support for 
the confirmation of California’s attor-
ney general, Xavier Becerra, to be the 
next Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. 
I am absolutely confident that Mr. 
Becerra has the knowledge, the experi-
ence, the skills, and, just as impor-
tantly, the values and principles re-
quired of this job—a job that will play 
a key role in beating the coronavirus 
and tackling the urgent issues of eq-
uity and affordability now facing our 
healthcare system. 
I am especially confident in my as-
sessment of Xavier Becerra because I 
have known him personally for years, 
both as a former colleague and as a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1599 
March 17, 2021 
friend. I first met then-Congressman 
Becerra in the House of Representa-
tives, where he served for over two dec-
ades with myself and the Presiding Of-
ficer and others, and where he was a 
champion for the healthcare rights of 
the American people, working over-
time to make sure that every Amer-
ican had access to quality, affordable 
healthcare. 
We served together in the House 
Democratic leadership, and we served 
together on the House Ways and Means 
Committee. So I have had an oppor-
tunity to see his legislative talents up 
front and also to witness his love of 
service to our country. 
We worked together to halt a number 
of proposals that maybe some of our 
Republican colleagues here in the Sen-
ate were pushing for, including the pro-
posal that continuously appeared in 
the 
House 
Republican 
budget 
to 
voucherize the Medicare Program. One 
of the former Speakers of the House 
wanted to essentially provide seniors 
on Medicare with a voucher and send 
them out into more of a private mar-
ketplace. It would have ended up put-
ting our seniors more at risk. So to-
gether we did battle that idea. 
We served together on what was 
known as the Congressional Joint Se-
lect Committee on Deficit Reduction, 
also known as the ‘‘supercommittee,’’ 
and known to some as the ‘‘not-so- 
super committee.’’ I saw him work to 
try to achieve agreements on some of 
the biggest challenges facing our coun-
try, but, like him, we both agreed that 
we weren’t going to do that at the ex-
pense of protecting Medicare for sen-
iors, protecting Medicaid as an abso-
lutely essential healthcare safety net 
for tens of millions of Americans, and 
we were not prepared to provide more 
tax cuts to the very wealthiest of 
Americans. 
It is in that last effort where Xavier 
Becerra, I think, really distinguished 
himself in the House, when it came to 
the issue of equity and healthcare. I 
know the Presiding Officer knows well 
the battles we all went in together in 
the development and passage of the Af-
fordable Care Act, and it was that that 
really defined Mr. Becerra’s legacy in 
the House. 
He championed the Affordable Care 
Act from the very start. He helped both 
to write and to pass this landmark law 
that now helps tens of millions of our 
fellow Americans, and after leaving the 
Congress, he led the charge to defend 
the Affordable Care Act against the 
Texas case before the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
Now, I know a lot of our Republican 
colleagues have also spent years fight-
ing the Affordable Care Act. We have 
seen that play out here in the U.S. Sen-
ate within the last couple years. But 
the reality is the Affordable Care Act 
is very important to the overwhelming 
majority of the American people who 
support it and is an essential lifeline to 
quality, affordable healthcare for tens 
of millions of Americans. And it is that 
that Mr. Becerra fought to pass and 
which he has fought to defend against 
constant attacks in the courts. 
There is no question that Xavier 
Becerra fights for what he believes is 
right, as he should, but that has never 
prevented him from working across the 
aisle to get things done. As the attor-
ney general in the State of California, 
he has repeatedly partnered with Re-
publicans to solve the pressing issues 
facing our fellow citizens. 
He builds bridges every day and has 
worked across party lines to expand ac-
cess to COVID–19 treatments, to con-
front the opioid crisis, and to address 
the dangers of vaping and smoking 
among our Nation’s youth. 
His record shows that Attorney Gen-
eral Becerra fights for what is impor-
tant to the people he represents, not 
the party he belongs to, and he has 
demonstrated it by example time and 
time again with his ability to bridge 
deep divisions, even during this time of 
division. I know that he will fight hard 
for each and every one of our fellow 
citizens and will not look to see wheth-
er somebody is a Democrat or a Repub-
lican or from some other party. What 
he cares about is making sure he is 
looking out for the healthcare of every 
American. 
And, at this moment, everyone in 
this country stands to benefit from an 
effective leader at the helm of the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. Our most pressing task is to con-
tain the spread of COVID–19 and to de-
feat COVID–19. That requires clear 
messaging on public health measures. 
That requires accelerating the dis-
tribution of vaccines and treatment 
and testing and making sure we do all 
of that in an equitable way. That 
means safely guiding the opening of 
our schools, and we all want our stu-
dents to get back to school as quickly 
as possible and as safely as possible. 
As the attorney general of California, 
he has led one of the largest depart-
ments of justice in the country, and, in 
that capacity, has stood up for strong 
consumer 
and 
worker 
protections 
throughout this pandemic and before, 
and I trust that he will continue to do 
so for all Americans as Secretary of 
HHS, if confirmed. 
We know that this public emergency 
and health crisis has been a blow to our 
country. It has also laid bare the fault 
lines in our healthcare system in terms 
of racial inequities, inaccessibility for 
underserved communities, and under-
investment in our public health infra-
structure. These issues, of course, pre-
dated COVID–19, but we must tackle 
them with renewed urgency as we 
emerge from this crisis. 
Mr. Becerra is equipped to root out 
these disparities, both because of his 
knowledge and skill and expertise but 
also because of his lived experience. 
Xavier grew up in a working-class 
Latino family. He knows the commu-
nities that are hurting most because he 
has lived in those communities. He 
would bring to this important office 
not only his expertise and skill but the 
empathy and the compassion needed to 
help those most in need. 
Like most of us, Mr. Becerra is also 
guided and motivated by what makes 
him most proud: his family. At his con-
firmation hearing, he spoke movingly 
about his wife and his children, who 
are all a part of all that he does. And 
he spoke about his parents, who trav-
eled to this country from Mexico seek-
ing a better life, with nothing more 
than, in Xavier’s words, ‘‘their health 
and their hope.’’ 
It is that health and that hope that 
propelled Mr. Becerra into a life of pub-
lic service, and it is that health and 
that hope that will animate his leader-
ship at the Department of Health and 
Human Services, should he be con-
firmed by this Senate. 
He was brought up in a family that 
believed in and sought the American 
dream, and he has spent his life fight-
ing to make that dream real for fami-
lies across this Nation. He believes, as 
I believe, that that mission requires us 
to care for the health and safety of 
each and every one of our fellow citi-
zens, and I have full confidence that he 
is up to the task. 
Colleagues, I urge us to confirm the 
nomination of Xavier Becerra to be the 
next Secretary of the Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The Senator from Indiana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 730 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, this 
past year has been hard on Hoosiers 
and Americans across the country. 
When the economy was shut down, 
Congress got to work. Given my back-
ground as a business owner, I was in-
volved in negotiating the Paycheck 
Protection Program, known as PPP, as 
part of the CARES Act, one of five bills 
that passed in 2020 with overwhelming 
support, I think 90-plus votes. We 
worked it out, Democrats and Repub-
licans, together. 
Those COVID-related packages to-
taled $4 trillion, and we didn’t have a 
penny saved up ahead of time to pre-
pare for it. That is part of a deeper 
problem with this institution, is that 
we borrow anything that we spend 
money on, even 23 percent of our an-
nual operating budget. To put that in 
perspective, imagine if you had a busi-
ness doing $100,000 in revenue, and you 
are losing $23,000, and then you go to 
your banker and expect them to bail 
you out. It wouldn’t make sense. 
We came into 2021 with over $1 tril-
lion from those packages unspent, un-
obligated. Instead of working with us 
like before, Democrats did shut us out 
of the process. In fact, the Senate as a 
whole did not work the bill through 
committees. It was laid to us, on the 
Senate, by the House, all $1.9 trillion of 
it. 
Before this, some Republicans went 
to the White House to talk with the 
President about a bipartisan plan, 
knowing all the money would be bor-
rowed again, but nothing came to fru-
ition. Instead, we stayed up all night;

S1600 
March 17, 2021 
finished the bill at noon the next day, 
Saturday; spent 29 hours on the floor, 
and not a single Republican amend-
ment was adopted in this massive 
spending bill. 
Instead of focusing on the virus and 
getting our economy back on track, 
this became an exercise in ramming 
something through that was a liberal 
wish list. Only 1 percent of the bill—1 
percent of the bill—went toward the 
vaccine. Less than 9 percent goes to-
ward COVID–19 public health issues 
generally. 
While the Congressional Budget Of-
fice projects the economy to return to 
prepandemic levels by midyear, only 5 
percent of the $130 billion for K–12 
schools gets spent this year, and none 
of it is tied to reopening our schools, 
which many States had shut down 
early and opened up late. 
Included in this package is a whop-
ping $350 billion for State and local 
governments. I had a conversation with 
our own Governor 2, 3 weeks ago. A 
place like Indiana, and I believe West 
Virginia as well, probably runs bal-
anced budgets. We do it with the guard-
rail of a constitutional amendment. 
Many other States, if they don’t have a 
constitutional amendment, they have a 
statute. In other words, you do what 
households do. You do what all busi-
nesses do. You live within your means. 
And here, when you run your State 
governments in a way that in good 
times, you can’t make ends meet, and 
you look to the Federal Government to 
bail out your bad governance, it is a 
whole nother issue. 
Even left-leaning economists and 
think tanks are worried about what 
this is going to do down the road be-
cause most of the time, you don’t feel 
the repercussions until later. And, of 
course, that could show up in inflation. 
It could show up in a way similar to 
what we dealt with in the late seven-
ties and the early eighties. 
Forty-four States had surpluses last 
year, when you look at COVID funding. 
Many places, like California, had sur-
pluses. Then they reconfigured how 
this was done not based on pro rata 
population but rewarded the States 
with the highest unemployment levels. 
It sounds bizarro to me. 
Governor Holcomb in Indiana has 
done a great job balancing the econ-
omy with public safety, and that is 
why our unemployment rate is now 
close to a full employment rate. It was 
the lowest in the Midwest going into it 
because we have a good business cli-
mate, and we have a low cost of living. 
Things work there. Sadly, the Demo-
crats’ bill punishes States like Indiana 
for safely reopening. The higher a 
State’s unemployment rate, again, the 
more bailout money you get propor-
tionately. 
But it goes one step further, and this 
is the part that caught my attention. I 
am interested in hearing the expla-
nation for it. I think it was a sneaky 
maneuver when you put it in such a 
large bill that had other doozies like 
stimulus checks for undocumented im-
migrants, for felons, all kinds of stuff 
that I think, when you look at it, 
shouldn’t have been in there. But when 
it is that massive—it takes 10, 11 hours 
to read out loud—you are going to get 
some of that. What this does is say 
that if a State takes Federal money, 
they cannot lower their State taxes in 
any way through 2024. 
First of all, I believe this is unconsti-
tutional 
and 
coercive. 
Second, 
we 
should never punish States for putting 
taxpayers first. We serve the public and 
should be good stewards of their 
money, and especially a place like this 
that runs the way it does day in and 
day out should not be telling States 
that run their operations responsibly 
that they cannot do what they want 
with spending or taxation. 
My bill strikes the provision that 
prohibits States’ ability to change rev-
enues as they see fit for their State’s 
unique needs. 
Second, my bill strips out the report-
ing requirement where States have to 
tell the Federal Government about 
every revenue source and amount of 
money they take in. This place ought 
to be doing that routinely to all the 
people who send it revenue. 
This bill has the support of over 25 
groups, including the American Legis-
lative Exchange Council, Americans 
for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Re-
form, Citizens Against Government 
Waste, 
Club 
for 
Growth, 
FreedomWorks, Heritage Action for 
America, Independent Women’s Forum, 
and the National Taxpayers Union, 
among others. We expect many more to 
join in coming days. I am sure many 
stakeholders in Indiana and in West 
Virginia not mentioned will throw in 
support as well. 
Lastly, I would like to thank the Fi-
nance Committee ranking member, 
Senator CRAPO, for cosponsoring this 
legislation—and others, including Sen-
ators 
BLACKBURN, 
CAPITO, 
INHOFE, 
MARSHALL, RUBIO, RICK SCOTT, TILLIS, 
and Senator YOUNG
from my home 
State. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Fi-
nance be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 730 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MANCHIN. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, my 
good friend the Senator from Indiana— 
I am hoping this is a misunder-
standing, and I hope I can explain it be-
cause I was very much involved in this 
process. 
First of all, as a former Governor, I 
know about the budget process. I know 
about balanced budgets. I used to meet 
every Tuesday afternoon. As Governor, 
I would have my finance people come 
to my office, and we would sit down 
and look at the revenue estimates. We 
had to make adjustments because we 
had a balanced budget amendment. 
Isn’t that a novelty, a balanced budget 
amendment? We had to live within our 
confines. That is something that no 
one who has ever been in State govern-
ment or ever run a business under-
stands. I understand that. But it is 
something that we did very religiously. 
The language in this bill, Senator 
from Indiana, the only thing this bill 
does—or that language you were con-
cerned about, the only thing it did— 
you can cut all you want to. You can 
manage all your money the way you 
want. You just can’t take Federal 
money and use it if you cut your rev-
enue intentionally. That is all. What 
we try to do is target where the money 
has gone. 
So the Treasury, you have to go—as 
a State, you go to the Treasury, and 
you show the need that you have. You 
show the cost—what COVID has cost 
your revenue and you are able to have 
money to replace that because COVID 
caused you that problem. 
You have also the ability to use this, 
in your State, for three things: water, 
sewer, and internet service. So you 
have infrastructure that can be done. 
Also, what we did in this bill is we 
have it going out to 2024, so you are not 
going to overheat, if you will—over-
heat or overcharge the economy. They 
can spread that out. The State and 
local moneys go in two tranches: Half 
this year, half next year is what you 
can access. The money to every one of 
your communities—for the first time, 
40 percent of that total money goes di-
rectly, so your large cities will get 
money directly from the Treasury. 
They have to show how they are using 
it for their backfill, not, basically, hav-
ing anything to do with what their tax 
revenue is. They just can’t use this 
money to backfill tax cuts if they want 
to do that. That is pretty simple be-
cause there is not a need for it. If you 
can reduce your taxes, then you don’t 
need Federal dollars to backfill to 
show that you are in good shape. But if 
you need it for anything else, you can 
use it for that. You can use it for all 
these things. 
I can tell you—I would assure you 
that every incorporated city in Indi-
ana, every county in Indiana has to be 
thrilled. They have to be thrilled for 
the first time to have control of their 
destiny. That was our intention. 
In the first CARES package, that 
never happened. The first CARES pack-
age went directly to the Governors, 
and if the Governors were very prudent 
in how they did it—set up a committee, 
worked through the legislature—some 
did, some didn’t, and there is a lot of 
money that never got into the basic fi-
bers of your State or my State. Now 
that is not going to be the problem. 
Also, they have the ability, if they 
have a water project they have been

March 17, 2021 
trying to do forever and never had the 
resources to do it, they can use their 
money for that. 
If they have a sewer project—I have 
said this: How do we pick water, sewer, 
and internet? They are not the sexy 
things that, basically, Governors and 
politicians go out and cut ribbons for— 
a sewer line or a water line that is bur-
ied 50 feet down. That is not a sexy 
thing. 
We knew the infrastructure was fall-
ing apart city by city and the ages of 
water lines are over 80 years in most of 
our cities. So we tried to do something. 
They have until 2024, so they don’t 
have to throw it out. It is not shovel- 
ready. It is a project you have been 
wanting to do but never could afford. 
I assure you, we do not want to im-
pede good fiscal management to make 
adjustments to do whatever they want 
to their tax codes. This does not pro-
hibit that. It just prohibits using and 
going to the Federal Treasury and say-
ing: I have a loss of revenue because I 
cut $100 billion or I cut $100 million or 
a billion dollars out of my State budget 
when I reduced taxes, and now I can’t 
pay my bills. 
Also, you can’t use this money from 
the Federal Government for your pen-
sions. That is a responsibility that we 
have. We call it OPEB, other postponed 
employment benefits. OPEB is other 
postponed employment benefits—pen-
sions, healthcare, all the things that 
when a person retires from their State, 
these are things that the State has a 
contract and an obligation for them in 
their retirement. It is the responsi-
bility of the States to manage that, 
and that, basically, keeps the State in 
a good financial position. It keeps your 
credit rating up or your credit rating 
low if you have managed yourself 
through it. This is only to help you 
with expenses and extraordinary ex-
penses 
that 
you 
incurred 
during 
COVID. That is all, sir. 
I don’t want the State of Indiana or 
any State to think that they can’t do 
whatever they want to with their 
taxes. They just can’t use the Federal 
Treasury to backfill something done 
deliberately, 
basically, 
or 
self-in-
flicted—a loss of revenue. That is about 
it in a nutshell. 
COVID–19 is the greatest challenge 
we have ever had. I know you men-
tioned a few things. I will tell you this 
because my dear friend from Maine is 
sitting here. We met quite a bit on the 
bill in a bipartisan way, even though a 
lot of it did not get in. The bill was big-
ger than what my friends—all of you, 
my friends on the Republican side— 
could basically vote for. I understand 
that. 
But please understand there are an 
awful lot of things we talked about 
that I did everything in my power to 
make 
sure 
the 
tranches—spreading 
them out, not going it all at one time. 
There is the RESTAURANTS Act. Sen-
ator WICKER and Senator SINEMA were 
on the RESTAURANTS Act. There 
was, basically, the homeless children’s 
bill that Senator MURKOWSKI and my-
self put in there. There was bipartisan-
ship in that. 
There should have been a lot more; I 
agree. We both know the process some-
times doesn’t work the way we want it 
to. But you make every effort you can 
to make it work. I did that. Whenever 
I talked, I said that this had bipartisan 
input. It didn’t come out as a bipar-
tisan vote, but there was bipartisan 
input into this piece of legislation, the 
best we possibly could. 
I think it is a piece of legislation 
that we—if you have education, there 
is not a school in America today that 
should not be able to have a program 
where they can make their school the 
safest environment that a child should 
be in. Every parent should be safe in 
thinking their children are in a safe 
place because of heating, ventilation— 
things that we have in this bill that 
allow education to have the resources 
it needs and, also, your higher edu-
cation too. 
The money that is going out—you 
have money going to the stimulus pay-
ments, going to all of your citizens at 
$75,000. We put a hard cap. We tried it 
to put a hard cap at $75,000 and $150,000. 
We found out the first CARES pack-
age—I don’t think that anyone on the 
Republican side or the Democrat side 
thought 
someone 
making 
$200,000, 
$300,000 would be getting money. They 
didn’t need a check, but we found out 
it happened. We didn’t intend for that 
to happen. That is the way the code 
read, and that is the way it kind of 
slipped into that. We stopped that from 
happening here. 
So we tried to do everything—and 
that, again, came from our bipartisan 
group. If it wasn’t for the bipartisan 
group talking and saying ‘‘This is 
something we can’t do,’’ I would have 
had things I might have missed. I 
wouldn’t have known some things that 
were of concern to all of us and some of 
the atrocities that happened that we 
didn’t want to repeat. We did all the 
things we could to stop that. 
I am very reluctant to object to any 
of my Senators, my fellow Senators, 
but on this one, sir—if I can work with 
you on this—I am objecting because I 
want to have a productive sit-down 
with you and we can work on some-
thing together. 
Please tell your Governor that he can 
cut away if he wants to. He just can’t 
go back to the Federal Government 
and say: OK, I made a mistake. Now I 
need your money. 
That is about it in a nutshell. If Indi-
ana can cut and it helps you and grows 
your economy, God bless you. If you 
have COVID expenses, we are going to 
help you. If you have projects—my 
goodness, just infrastructure projects— 
then there is no impediment there if 
you have internet services you need, if 
you have water services, and you have 
sewer services. 
In West Virginia, what we are trying 
to do right now is put a team together 
that can basically work from this. The 
State has money for those three 
tranches of infrastructure. The coun-
ties have it, and the municipalities 
have it. The unincorporated towns that 
aren’t able to get money directly are 
going to count on the county and the 
State. 
There is so much good to be done to 
make it work for you to make sure 
they understand. They are elated to 
now have a project they never could 
finish, like upgrade your services, fin-
ish your water line, have internet serv-
ice you have never had before. These 
are all unbelievable opportunities that 
we have never had. 
The bipartisan SMART Act that was 
filed in May 2020 included both of these 
guardrails, plus another one required 
maintenance of effort. We have that in 
there. Maintenance of effort—we put 
that back then. 
The Bipartisan State and Local Sup-
port of Small Business Protections Act 
that was released last December had 
exactly the same language. This is not 
new language, sir. This is the same lan-
guage that has been there. 
They have never been able to backfill 
for, basically, discretionary cuts that 
they made themselves. It doesn’t pro-
hibit them, the same as it doesn’t pro-
hibit anybody in their State for hav-
ing—and being a former Governor, I am 
very partial to the 10th Amendment to 
the Constitution, States rights. You 
have those rights. Now you have the 
assistance also with those rights. 
I am hoping to improve everyone’s 
situation. I know it does in West Vir-
ginia. I hope it does in Maine. I hope it 
does in Indiana, and I think it will. 
It is all about making these emer-
gency funds get to the right people. We 
are trying to target it. It is something 
we have to keep an eye on. I can tell if 
we do it and do it right and we are good 
stewards, this will get us through this 
COVID challenge that we have because 
we really don’t know. 
I am hoping we come out of this guns 
ablazing in July—we come out of this, 
and the economy takes off like a rock-
et. Sometimes when they take off, they 
tend to level off too. 
We want to make sure we are still 
out there for 2022, 2023, out to 2024. And 
if they do it and do it right, they can. 
They can finish their projects and be 
able to have the moneys as needed for 
emergencies if it has a dip. 
With that, we thought we had worked 
something, but the language is nothing 
new. It is not a surprise. It was not 
anything that was put in; it has been in 
there. Basically, it is language that 
spells out pretty directly how you can 
use your money and what money you 
can’t acquire. That is the only thing 
we did. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MANCHIN. Yes, there is objec-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Indiana.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1602 
March 17, 2021 
Mr. BRAUN. My friend from West 
Virginia explained why this won’t im-
pact Governors and legislatures in 
terms of what they can do with their 
own fiscal policy. I would say my 
friend the Senator from West Virginia 
probably ought to check with Governor 
Justice and his legislature to see if 
they are on the same wavelength there. 
When we got input in bringing this 
up as an issue and when you are talk-
ing about the American Legislative Ex-
change Council, Americans for Tax Re-
form, Citizens Against Government 
Waste—I won’t repeat the rest of the 
list—I think it would get down to se-
mantics in this sense: What do you do 
if you want to cut tax rates? Then, just 
like pre-COVID, we cut taxes, and reve-
nues went up for 3 to 4 years. 
How do you measure that com-
plicated equation? In many cases, when 
you cut rates, you find a new sweet 
spot where you generate more tax rev-
enue. How would you sort all of that 
out? Then, if it were not based upon pe-
nalizing States that are most apt to 
lower their tax rates because of how 
good their economies were pre-COVID, 
it would be a different issue as well. 
So I am willing to listen in terms of 
how that does play out, but for now, I 
am going to view it as something, I 
think, that is not going to sit well with 
many States, their Governors, or their 
legislatures and that has a possibility 
of being taken to court as being some-
thing that might be unconstitutional. 
If I am off base, I am willing to listen, 
but I will probably have to bring some 
other parties in to make sure that this 
isn’t a case of semantics and is real ac-
cording to the way you explain it. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Will the Senator 
yield? 
Mr. BRAUN. Yes, I will yield. 
Mr. MANCHIN. First of all, I did have 
a nice conversation with Governor Jus-
tice. He and I have disagreed on basic 
issues on Tax Code legislation, and we 
are trying to work through all of that. 
I explained it to him. I said that it 
doesn’t do a thing in that it doesn’t im-
pede you at all. If you want to cut, go 
ahead and cut. He is still moving 
through with the legislation. He might 
succeed on that, and he might not. 
With that, I will make it very clear 
that this is not new language. You can-
not backfill. You cannot backfill. The 
only thing you can use your money for 
is for COVID expenses. Basically, if 
your revenues were down through no 
fault of your own, business dropped off, 
and your tax collections were down 
through no fault of your own, then that 
is what this is for. COVID caused you a 
problem. It caused you an imposition 
and put strain on the services that you 
are basically providing to the people of 
West Virginia and Indiana. 
We want to make sure that your first 
responders are there and your edu-
cation is there, that everything is still 
running the way it is supposed to. That 
is why we have passed five bills in try-
ing to keep things afloat, and we think 
we have done that. So it does not im-
pede that whatsoever. We have also 
looked at it constitutionally, and we 
are solid on the Constitution. 
All we are asking is, does the Federal 
Government have a responsibility to 
backfill with Treasury dollars a deci-
sion that could be self-inflicted? That 
is all. You should live with that or my 
State should live with it or reap the 
benefits. We are not penalized. Even if 
your revenues went up, you still had 
COVID 
expenses 
you 
could 
offset. 
Those were legitimate expenses that 
you incurred during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. The COVID–19 pandemic is what 
we are talking about. So if your reve-
nues went up after that, we are not pe-
nalizing you. If they went down, that is 
a whole other story because COVID 
caused that, but you just can’t cause it 
yourself. I think this is it in a nutshell. 
Mr. BRAUN. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. MANCHIN. Yes, I will yield. 
Mr. BRAUN. I think it begs the ques-
tion in that, by cutting taxes, you are 
going to lower gross tax revenues, and 
that has been a discussion we have all 
had for many years. 
I know in places like Indiana—and we 
just had it occur here with the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act at the Federal 
level—that the CBO—and I was work-
ing with it—was getting close to saying 
its original forecast of when you had a 
tax cut, which was $1.5 trillion over 10 
years, $150 billion per year, wasn’t 
working out that way because there is 
the phenomenon called: When you find 
the sweet spot of taxation, you can cut 
taxes and generate more revenue. Then 
you penalize a good fiscal move by the 
way you are interpreting your reading. 
I am willing to get into the nuance to 
see if that would muster that par-
ticular case, but I don’t think it would. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Will the Senator 
yield? 
Mr. BRAUN. Yes, I will yield. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Senator BRAUN has 
always been very kind and very reason-
able, and I look forward to sitting 
down with him on this. 
What he has said is absolutely cor-
rect in that we are not penalizing. We 
don’t intend to penalize anybody who 
has made that decision, but the Sen-
ator is talking about a State that has 
a balanced budget amendment year in 
and year out. There is a time when a 
Governor has to make a decision and 
go to his legislature and say: Hey, we 
are going to be X amount of dollars 
short, so we need to cut. So they start 
cutting and cutting services. That is 
what happens in order to balance the 
budget usually—services are cut to the 
people. 
We are just saying in our piece of leg-
islation here that we have that we 
don’t want that to happen because it is 
of no fault of your own, but if you cut 
your taxes and you are thinking, well, 
5 years down the road, we are going to 
have more revenue, then that is fine. 
You just can’t backfill for that short 
period of time and use it for something 
for which you have cut revenues, basi-
cally, in a self-inflicting way. It might 
be a self-ingratiating way to where it 
will help you down the road, but you 
still can’t backfill for that. 
Now, for any COVID expenses you 
have, absolutely, you can fill that hole. 
Show that you have had COVID ex-
penses. If you were to say, ‘‘OK. We 
filled all of our holes for COVID, and 
now we have water, sewer, and inter-
net’’—and trust me, there is not a 
place in Indiana or in West Virginia 
that doesn’t need help there. 
I thank the Senator. I appreciate it. 
I yield the floor.

PROTECT AND SERVE ACT 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of the brave, hard-working 
men and women who serve as law en-
forcement officers in our communities 
across the Nation. Men and women in 
law enforcement risk life and limb 
every day to protect public safety and 
preserve the rule of law. They truly are 
American heroes. 
In recognition of their remarkable 
service and sacrifice, I am reintro-
ducing the Protect and Serve Act. I 
hope every Senator agrees we must do 
everything we can to support the men 
and women in blue. I also call on my 
colleagues to support this common-
sense legislation. It is my hope that 
this legislation will unite us on a bi-
partisan basis to support those heroes 
who keep us safe. 
I can think of no better example of 
why we need this legislation than the 
events of January 6, right here in this 
Chamber and across the Capitol. While 
a ruthless, anarchist mob sought to 
disrupt and destroy our democracy, 
Capitol Police officers bravely kept us 
safe from harm while they were being 
viciously attacked by the violent mob. 
Many of my colleagues saw this first-
hand while they were getting us into a 
safe position as the events unfolded 
that day. 
Because this attack occurred in DC, 
though, there are only limited laws in 
place to prosecute those who would as-
sault a law enforcement officer. Under 
current law, a criminal who assaults a 
law enforcement officer with a deadly 
weapon or who inflicts bodily injury 
could receive anywhere from a fine to 
20 years in prison. Under the Protect 
and Serve Act, these violent criminals 
will receive an additional 10 years in 
prison if they assault an officer, and if 
they murder or kidnap a law enforce-
ment officer, they could be given life 
sentences. 
This would apply not only to Federal 
law enforcement and Federal prop-
erties, but it could also be used to pros-
ecute criminals at the State and local 
levels who target law enforcement offi-
cers. This Federal law would ensure

that prosecutors have every tool avail-
able to punish those who attack the 
men and women in blue. 
Nationwide in 2020, 47 law enforce-
ment officers were killed in the line of 
duty, and over 300 were shot. Three of 
those murdered officers were right in 
my home State of North Carolina. So 
far in 2021, 14 officers have been killed 
in the line of duty, and over 50 have 
been shot. Countless others have been 
assaulted. 
The year 2020 saw the rise of radical 
ideas like abolishing the police, which 
fueled distrust and disdain for our 
brave men and women in blue. Even 
while Americans of all views are call-
ing for transparency and account-
ability, the ideas of abolishing and 
defunding the police only serve to 
deepen the divide in our country and 
our communities. 
It is sad that Congress even needs to 
consider a bill to protect law enforce-
ment officers. The heated rhetoric and 
the violent attacks on officers are hav-
ing real world impacts beyond just the 
safety of our law enforcement commu-
nity. Across the country, recruitments 
are down and retirements are up. We 
have cities having to increase funding 
for recruiting and finding people that 
will replace those who have left the 
profession or retired early. This is sad, 
but it is not surprising. Law enforce-
ment officers put their lives at risk 
every single day. They leave their 
spouses and families every morning, 
and they don’t know if they are going 
to come back. 
In 2018, before the antipolice rhetoric 
took hold, the House passed the legisla-
tion by an overwhelming vote of 382 to 
35—the bill that I am reintroducing— 
including 
220 
Republicans 
and 
162 
Democrats. On the floor, every current 
Member of the House Democratic lead-
ership voted in favor of this legislation, 
including Speaker PELOSI. 
This has been bipartisan legislation, 
and it should be bipartisan legislation 
today, which is why I call on all of my 
colleagues—Members of the Republican 
caucus and the Democratic caucus—to 
join us in support of this commonsense 
and needed legislation. 
Congress must pass the Protect and 
Serve Act right away and boldly say 
that there is no escape from justice for 
dangerous criminals who intentionally 
assault and kill our hard-working, 
dedicated law enforcement officers. 
I urge the American people: Call your 
Senators. Ask them to support the 
measure. Tell them that you want this 
bill passed and our law enforcement of-
ficers protected. Don’t be silent. Help 
me fight for the men and women in 
blue, because they are counting on us. 
And along the way, when you see a law 
enforcement officer, thank them for 
their service and let them know Mem-
bers of Congress are fighting for them. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
last month, the American people cre-
ated 379,000 new jobs across our coun-
try. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2 
percent. Our economy is recovering. We 
are actually on our way back to nor-
mal. 
In early February, the Congressional 
Budget Office published a report on 
this. The report says that our economy 
will reach the same size that it was be-
fore the pandemic, and it will do it in 
just a few months. It says this summer 
our economy will be back to normal. 
Now, the CBO made that projection 
weeks before the Democrats passed and 
the President signed into law a $1.9 
trillion wish list. In other words, our 
economy would be back to normal even 
had they never passed the bill. We 
would be back to normal without a 
dime of this incredible high amount of 
spending. 
We didn’t need the liberal wish list. 
The country doesn’t need it. Yet it is 
obvious 
why 
Democrats 
rushed— 
rushed—their liberal wish list into law. 
They wanted to stamp their name on 
the recovery that was coming, no mat-
ter what. I have no doubt that that is 
the goal. 
Yet the truth is clear: This is not 
President Biden’s recovery. President 
Biden inherited three vaccines—suc-
cessful vaccines, vaccines that work 
and are safe. President Biden inherited 
2 million tests a day for coronavirus. 
President 
Biden 
inherited 
falling 
coronavirus numbers. He also inherited 
a recovering economy. 
Last year, we saw the fastest eco-
nomic recovery in American history. 
The unemployment rate fell by half in 
6 months. The American people created 
more than 12 million jobs coming back 
from the pandemic. They did it in just 
6 months. That is more jobs than were 
created in the 8 years of the Obama- 
Biden administration. 
Now, this was in large part because 
of the foundation laid by Republicans 
before the pandemic, with President 
Trump’s economic programs in the 
White House. Republicans cut taxes for 
the middle class, on job creators. We 
cut regulations, and we cut govern-
ment redtape. We made a better trade 
deal with our neighbors. Our agenda 
worked. 
Just before the pandemic hit, the un-
employment rate was down to 3.6 per-
cent. The American people created 
more than 7 million new jobs under 
President Trump. We saw record-low 
unemployment for Hispanic Ameri-
cans, Asian Americans, and African 
Americans. We reached the lowest un-
employment rate for women in 60 
years. 
When America began to reopen, the 
success of that agenda helped us re-
cover at a record pace. The economy is 
also recovering because we are making 
progress against the virus. 
With Republicans in the White House 
and a Republican majority in the U.S. 
Senate, we passed more than $4 trillion 
in coronavirus relief. Unlike the Demo-
crats’ relief wish list, all five of our 
bills were bipartisan. They each got 90 
votes in the Senate or more. 
Operation Warp Speed broke records 
for vaccine development. A new vac-
cine typically takes about 10 years 
from the lab to people’s arms. The pre-
vious record for a vaccine was for 
mumps. It took 4 years. Last year, we 
achieved two coronavirus vaccines in 10 
months. We broke records, and it 
wasn’t even close. The Food and Drug 
Administration made dozens of cuts to 
regulations in order to make this hap-
pen. 
The Biden administration has not 
played it straight with the American 
people about coronavirus. We remem-
ber when Vice President Harris said 
that there was ‘‘no national strategy or 
plan for vaccinations.’’ 
We were delivering millions of doses 
of vaccines in December. President 
Biden said: ‘‘We got into office and 
there 
was 
nothing 
in 
the 
refrig-
erator’’—‘‘nothing in the refrigerator.’’ 
The Biden campaign and now the 
Biden administration has repeatedly 
misled the American people on the 
coronavirus. 
They 
have 
repeatedly 
taken credit for things for which they 
deserve no credit. 
Mark my words. This summer they 
are going to try to take credit for our 
recovery. If they do, they will be flat- 
out wrong. 
Our recovery was booming under the 
Republican agenda, and it was an agen-
da of low taxes and fewer regulations. 
That is the agenda that the American 
people need to get our economy boom-
ing again. 
DEMOCRATS’ AGENDA 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, I also come to the floor to oppose 
what I see as a radical agenda of the 
Democrats in Congress. 
It has not even been 2 months since 
the Democrats took over the Senate, 
and they have already rolled out one of 
the most leftwing agendas in American 
history. They have already spent $1.9 
trillion—trillion with a ‘‘t’’—$1.9 tril-
lion of our tax dollars. Twenty-six 
Democrats have endorsed amnesty for 
illegal immigrants. Nearly every Dem-
ocrat has endorsed giving statehood to 
Washington, DC, and now Senator 
SCHUMER has put gun control on the 
Senate’s to-do list. Democrats have 
proposed a radical agenda that invades 
nearly every aspect of American life. 
Yet the driving force behind this 
agenda is not the Senate. It is still the 
House. House Democrats have gone 
after our First Amendment right to 
freedom of religion. They have gone 
after our Second Amendment right to 
keep and bear arms. They have gone 
after our right to work. When Demo-
crats are in charge, none of our rights 
are safe. 
Neither are our most cherished insti-
tutions. House Democrats have gone 
after our police, gone after our elec-
tions. They lecture Republicans about 
accepting the results of elections. Yet 
they are trying to overturn an election 
in Iowa. 
Now, the lawyer the Democrats have 
put in charge of that case was just

sanctioned in Federal court on ethics 
violations. Yet Speaker PELOSI
has 
made it clear at her press conference 
on Friday that she supports the effort 
to overturn the election. 
That is not all. Democrats aren’t just 
trying to change one election. They are 
trying to change all of our elections. 
They have passed a bill to change just 
about every aspect of our elections for-
ever. 
A recent poll by Harvard shows that 
71 percent of voters say they don’t 
want future elections to be like they 
were in 2020. If Democrats get their 
way, every election will be a pandemic 
election. 
To change our elections, Democrats 
still need 60 votes in the Senate. That 
is why over the weekend, Democrats’ 
allies at the New York Times endorsed 
changing the rules of the Senate. The 
paper explicitly said that that was the 
reason. The paper attacked Members of 
this body—Senator MANCHIN and Sen-
ator SINEMA—who have had the cour-
age to oppose changing the rules of the 
Senate. The editorial board said: ‘‘This 
is a singular moment for American de-
mocracy, if Democrats are willing to 
seize it.’’ 
It is dangerous. It is scary. Yet it is 
true. This is a singular moment. Once 
they rig the Senate, then they can rig 
our elections. Once they rig our elec-
tions, then there will be nothing to 
stop them. Then they can go after our 
religious freedoms. They can go after 
our rights to keep and bear arms. And 
they can spend as many of our hard- 
earned tax dollars as they want. 
This certainly is a singular moment 
for our democracy. It is a moment for 
Senators on both sides of the aisle to 
stand up to this radical agenda. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
MARCH MADNESS 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I rise 
today to speak about a subject that is 
a point of pride and a source of passion 
for my constituents. 
Visit Indiana, and you are bound to 
see them: a backboard hammered to an 
old barn, rows of asphalt courts in city 
parks, a lone hoop in front of a corn-
field or in a clearing, steel poles stand-
ing in driveways. 
Though basketball wasn’t technically 
invented in Indiana, Indiana is indeed 
its epicenter. Even the game’s inven-
tor, James Naismith, once said: ‘‘Bas-
ketball really had its origin in Indiana, 
which remains the center of the sport.’’ 
So it is appropriate that this year’s 
NCAA tournament will be played in its 
entirety in our State. 
Now this, of course, is in part be-
cause planning and hosting 68 teams in 
the middle of a global pandemic pre-
sents unprecedented challenges, chal-
lenges that Hoosiers in and around In-
dianapolis are going to be able to navi-
gate. And they will be able to work 
their world-class college campuses in 
order to host teams from around the 
country. It is a great source of pride 
for us. 
But it is also fitting because this 
sport is so important to our State. You 
see, it is March Madness meets Hoosier 
Hysteria. The gyms where we play bas-
ketball are historic sites. The men and 
women 
who 
have 
competed 
and 
coached back home are Indiana folk 
heroes. We know their names. They are 
part of our common language: The Big 
O, Catch, the General, Bird, Wooden. 
Memorabilia, artifacts, and sites as-
sociated with them are preserved in 
museums and townhalls. They are in 
school gyms. They are marked by 
bronze plaques and other ways to me-
morialize those who have preceded us. 
Streets and roads are named in their 
honor. We can even identify legendary 
teams and major moments in our bas-
ketball history with just a few almost 
mythic words that are familiar to the 
ears of Hoosiers: ‘‘Franklin Wonder 
Five,’’ ‘‘Plump’s last shot,’’ ‘‘8 points 
in 9 seconds,’’ and, yes, the infamous 
‘‘chair throw.’’ 
Even the color of the ball—orange, of 
course—can be traced back to a Hoo-
sier, Tony Hinkle, who thought it was 
a good idea. 
For Indiana, basketball is much more 
than just a pastime. It is a source of 
joy. It is a source of joy for our com-
munities, and it brings the people in 
and across them together. After all, it 
takes little more than a basket and a 
ball to play. 
That is why wherever you go in Indi-
ana and no matter the neighborhood 
you might be visiting or passing by, be 
it affluent or hit by hard times, in the 
country or in the city, you are going to 
see basketball played. It almost doesn’t 
matter what the time of year it is or 
what the weather is like, you are likely 
to see basketball if you hit the road for 
a few hours in Indiana at any given 
time of year. You are going to hear it 
discussed. The basketball court and the 
gymnasium bleachers are great lev-
elers. 
I am sharing this with you because 
there is a larger point at play. Today, 
it increasingly seems that Americans 
have less and less in common with one 
another; that we are defining ourselves 
not as a diverse nation united by a 
common set of values with a shared 
past and a shared future, but we are in-
stead sorting ourselves into tribes 
based on geography or class or even po-
litical affiliation. This has been accom-
panied by the hollowing out of many of 
our communities and a loss of faith in 
the public spaces and access to these 
public spaces and institutions that 
shape our national identity and bind 
this vast, pluralistic, and beautiful 
country together. 
Now, these are dangerous trends, this 
separation, this tribalism; ones that we 
are going to have to work hard to turn 
back. There is only so much this body 
can do—I am under no illusions—there 
is only so much government can do to 
make America whole again. 
That is why we should cherish and 
celebrate the institutions that do have 
the power to unite us. And, as any Hoo-
sier will tell you, basketball is one of 
them. 
Even beyond this, as its history in In-
diana shows, this shared ritual that 
brings us joy and brings us together 
also pushes us to be better individually 
and collectively. 
I think of the persistence of a teen-
ager by the name of Steve Alford, end-
lessly practicing free throws in his 
driveway in New Castle, even in the 
snow and rain; and the courage of Indi-
ana University’s Bill Garrett, who 
fought segregation and broke the Big 
Ten color barrier; and then the faith of 
Little Milan High, enrollment hardly 
100, beating mighty Muncie Central, 
enrollment over 1,000, for the 1954 State 
high school championship; the grace of 
successive generations of graduates at 
Crispus Attucks. Now, this is a high 
school built to segregate Black stu-
dents in Indianapolis, but it then grew 
into an academic and athletic power-
house whose basketball program was a 
beacon in the civil rights movement 
and, to this day, remains a great 
source of pride not just for Black Hoo-
siers but for all Hoosiers. It was also 
the first African-American team to win 
a State championship in the Nation; 
the spirit of the tiny town of Medora, 
an underdog community featured in a 
recent documentary, who stood by 
their team while its players laced up 
work boots because they couldn’t af-
ford basketball shoes. Then they set 
out with grit and determination and 
resolve to end a season losing streak. 
So these scenes from Indiana’s his-
tory, up to the present day, like the 
game itself, unite people from different 
backgrounds, and they foster pride in 
our places, especially our struggling 
places. They teach us to draw a line be-
tween competition and contempt, to 
keep perspective and to have the hu-
mility to remember that defeat is 
never permanent and neither is vic-
tory. They help us see and treasure 
what we have in common. They show 
us the power of opportunity and em-
powerment. 
Institutions like basketball can’t be 
taken for granted. They bring meaning 
and purpose into the lives of people and 
places that we call home. They encour-
age our citizens to dream beyond limit, 
and I would say that they are what we 
need in this Nation right now. 
So as the NCAA tournament tips off 
and the games begin across our sta-
diums, field houses, and arenas, Indi-
ana’s hardwood civic temples, as we 
like to think of them, I know will be a 
reflection for our love for basketball 
and an exhibition of our collaborative 
ability to host such a large event dur-
ing such a difficult time. 
But what will also be on display is 
the other reason it is right and proper 
that this event takes place in Indiana. 
We are devoted to this sport because it 
brings us hope, and it brings us to-
gether. It instills the virtues necessary 
to preserve many of the other features 
that make our country so special. It 
really can help make America whole 
again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1605 
March 17, 2021 
Now and then, we all need to be gent-
ly reminded, I think, of the importance 
of these very things, and I can think of 
no better time or place for that than 
March in Indiana. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me thank my colleague from Indiana. 
You can’t do better than ‘‘Hoosiers.’’ It 
is one of my favorite movies. It is the 
story of a small Indiana town beating 
the big city players, and, if I am not 
mistaken, my former colleague in the 
House, Lee Hamilton, might have been 
one of those players on the big city 
team. I think he told me at one point. 
It is a great story and all eyes are on 
Indianapolis and Indiana now with the 
NCAA tournament and your neighbors 
to the west, Illinois, headed across the 
border. It is going to make a good 
showing, I hope, for the Fighting Illini. 
Thank you very much for reminding 
us of that great American tradition. 
SENATE FILIBUSTER RULE 
Madam President, earlier in the day, 
my friend and colleague from Texas, 
Senator CORNYN, came to the floor and 
raised some questions about my com-
mitment to the filibuster as a rule in 
the Senate. He quoted me several years 
ago as saying the filibuster is kind of 
an indication of what the Senate was 
all about, and I still stand by that. 
The Senate, of course, with two Sen-
ators from each State, regardless of 
their population, is an opportunity for 
smaller States and minorities to be 
represented and to have a voice. And 
the filibuster, at least in some re-
spects, was a procedural reflection of 
that same value. 
But I would say to Senator CORNYN, I 
have been moved and changed my mind 
somewhat on filibuster because of 
nothing—nothing. That is what has 
been happening on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate, nothing. When Senator MCCON-
NELL, as the Republican leader, was in 
charge of the Senate over the last 2 
years, we did little or nothing. 
I didn’t run for this office to rep-
resent the people of Illinois and to help 
our Nation to watch the ink dry on 
documents that are being pushed back 
and forth on desks here. We came here 
to do something. 
Two years ago, because of the fili-
buster, 2 years ago, we considered 22 
amendments in the course of 1 year on 
the floor of the Senate. That is not 
counting vote-arama, that contraption 
of a procedure where we debate all of 2 
minutes before we vote on something, 
but real debate and real amendments— 
22. 
Well, the following year, 2020, dra-
matic increase. We went all the way up 
to 29 amendments in the course of a 
year. 
You say: Well, give me some meas-
urement in history. My wife said: What 
does that mean? In the first year of the 
Obama administration, we had 240 
amendments in the first year. Now we 
are down to 22 and 29. Why? Because we 
reached a point now where everyone as-
sumes that every issue is going to be 
filibustered, and therefore if you don’t 
have 60 votes, forget it. 
Well, it is rare that that kind of 
supermajority shows up on anything 
important. 
That is what happens when you play 
out the filibuster tradition to an ex-
treme. As one staffer said to me the 
other day, the Senate is in a death spi-
ral. No one can bring anything to the 
floor that might be subject to a fili-
buster 
because 
you 
can’t 
imagine 
where you are going to get 60 votes. 
I hope he is wrong, but I can under-
stand his analysis. The measures that 
we have considered so far this year in 
the U.S. Senate, after 2 months-plus— 
well, 
the 
impeachment 
trial—that 
didn’t require any filibuster votes. The 
nominations that come before us every 
day are not subject to a filibuster. And, 
of course, there is the reconciliation 
bill—the American rescue program for 
President Biden—that was under a pro-
cedure where you couldn’t use a fili-
buster. 
So now things are quiet on the floor 
of the Senate again this week and next 
week because whatever you bring here 
is subject to a threat of a filibuster, 
and you need 60 votes. I have watched 
this play out on an issue near and dear 
to my heart. It is called the DREAM 
Act, which I introduced 20 years ago— 
20 years ago. It basically says that if 
you were brought to this country as an 
infant, toddler, or a child—your par-
ents made the decision—you grow up 
here and you ought to have a fighting 
chance to earn your way to legal status 
and citizenship. That is it. 
Overwhelming majorities of people in 
all political parties support it. They 
think it is a good idea. And you say: 
DURBIN, you came here to be a legis-
lator, and, in 20 years, you can’t pass 
one bill? 
Well, I tried. Five times I brought 
the DREAM Act to the floor of the U.S. 
Senate, and it was stopped with a fili-
buster each and every time. I got a ma-
jority, and I still have a majority in 
support of it, but I can’t get that 60 
votes—that magic 60 votes that is 
needed under a filibuster. 
Well, I am frustrated by that, and I 
hope my frustration is manifest by 
what I said on the floor. My challenge 
to the Members of the Senate on both 
sides of the aisle is very simply this: If 
you believe in the filibuster and if you 
believe in working, show me that you 
can pass an important bill subject to 
the filibuster. Do it next week or the 
week following. Bring something to the 
floor. Let’s debate it, let’s amend, and 
let’s vote it. I don’t think that is un-
reasonable to ask. In fact, I think that 
is the reason we were elected to come 
here. 
So I would say to the defenders of the 
filibuster: Try to defend what has hap-
pened on the floor of the Senate the 
last 2 years—almost nothing. We can 
do better. The American people expect 
it of us. 
GEORGIA SHOOTINGS 
Madam President, last night, near 
Atlanta, GA, a gunman murdered eight 
people in what appears to be an act of 
domestic terrorism. Six of the eight 
victims were women of Asian descent. 
We mourn the lives of those lost and 
pray for the families and loved ones. 
While local and Federal authorities 
are still investigating the gunman’s 
motives, we know that in the past year 
it has been a perilous time for Asian 
Americans and those from the Pacific 
Islands, especially women. 
Since 
the 
pandemic 
began 
last 
March, nearly 3,800 hate incidents tar-
geting these Americans have been re-
ported. I expect the number of unre-
ported incidents is much higher. 
Asian-American women have had rac-
ist insults shouted at them from across 
streets. Grandparents have been as-
saulted and killed while running er-
rands. Some Asian Americans have 
even begun carrying pepper spray, 
wearing body cameras, and walking in 
groups to protect themselves from 
wanton violence. Increasingly, AAPI 
Americans do not feel safe in their own 
neighborhoods. 
This palpable fear is proof of how 
dangerous racist stereotypes and dema-
goguery can be. When former President 
Trump 
insists 
on 
calling 
the 
coronavirus the ‘‘China virus,’’ as he 
did again last night on FOX News, he is 
not simply spouting hateful, childish 
rhetoric. He is granting people permis-
sion. Permission to target neighbors 
and fellow citizens. Permission to hate. 
This kind of language divides and 
preys on fears. It offers the kind of an-
swer to every problem that you might 
expect from these people. There is al-
ways somebody you could fear and 
someone you can hate. The sad reality 
is that racist fear-mongering has al-
ways been part of the American story. 
Today, we know, by testimony from 
the FBI Director, that it is a growing 
danger to every American. Intelligence 
analysts warn us that White suprema-
cists and other far-right extremists are 
the most significant domestic ter-
rorism threat facing the United States. 
Of course, we look across the ocean to 
the threat of terrorism after 9/11. 
Sadly, now we have to look across the 
street. 
For far too long the Federal Govern-
ment has failed to adequately address 
this growing threat. We saw the lethal 
results of that inattention on January 
6, right here in this Senate Chamber. 
Groups of far-right nationalists and 
neo-Nazis, provoked by former Presi-
dent Trump, stormed our Capitol in an 
attempted insurrection. 
I have introduced a bipartisan bill in 
the Senate that would give law en-
forcement the resources to address this 
threat. It is called the Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act. It would estab-
lish offices to combat domestic ter-
rorism in the Department of Justice, 
the FBI, and the Department of Home-
land Security. Those offices would as-
sess the domestic terrorism threat reg-
ularly so that law enforcement can 
focus their limited resources on the 
most significant threats, like those 
facing AAPI Americans today.

My bill would also provide training 
and resources to assist State, local, 
and Tribal law enforcement in address-
ing those threats. I am sure commu-
nities across this Nation could use that 
support. 
And there is the issue of how these 
terrorist acts are committed. Last 
night’s attack near Atlanta was a mass 
shooting, a uniquely American threat. 
Next week, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, which I chair, will hold a hear-
ing on gun violence in America. Too 
many people get shot in America—not 
just near Atlanta but in the cities of 
Chicago and St. Louis and all across 
our country. How many times have we 
seen images in those communities like 
we did last night of another mass 
shooting? America is better than this. 
We need to take action to reduce the 
number of gun deaths in this Nation. 
We are going to get to work in the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee to try to find 
some common, bipartisan ground to ad-
dress it. Maybe we will fail. I hope we 
succeed. We have to try. 
It is time for the Senate to stop cow-
ering before any special interest group 
and pass commonsense gun safety pol-
icy. To the people of Atlanta, to mem-
bers of the AAPI community, and all 
across America, we are standing with 
you. We are grieving with you. We will 
do everything in our power to protect 
you. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Madam President, our Nation is at a 
critical moment in our fight against 
COVID–19. We have seen declining in-
fections, declining hospitalizations and 
deaths. And thanks to three effective 
vaccines—and, perhaps, more on the 
way—and 
adherence 
to 
social 
distancing and mask wearing, this new 
administration has put together a com-
prehensive plan to address and defeat 
this virus, but we aren’t out of the 
woods yet. 
In the United States, we have less 
than 5 percent of the world’s popu-
lation and 20 percent of the COVID 
cases and deaths. We can continue to 
see 50,000 to 60,000 new COVID cases 
every day. We still have approximately 
4,700 people hospitalized because of 
COVID in the United States. We still 
tragically lose 1,200 American lives 
each day. 
While access is improving greatly, we 
still see too many people struggling to 
get a vaccine. If we are going to defeat 
this virus once and for all, we need our 
top public health officials in place on 
the job. 
Yet our Republican colleagues con-
tinue to block the nomination of Xa-
vier Becerra to head the Department of 
Health and Human Services, the chief 
Federal Agency responsible for our 
public health response to COVID. Their 
campaign to leave the top public 
health position in this Nation empty in 
the midst of a pandemic is unwise. It 
has to come to an end. 
It has been 3 months—3 months— 
since President Biden announced that 
he would nominate Mr. Becerra to 
serve as Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. A majority of Sen-
ators support his nomination. I do. He 
is a personal friend and someone I have 
known for years. He is extremely com-
petent and ready for the job. 
Yet Republican Senators continue to 
delay Xavier Becerra’s nomination day 
after day after day. Their objections to 
him are all over the map. They say 
they oppose him because of his support 
for the Affordable Care Act. Remember 
that one—President Obama’s Afford-
able Care Act, which took half of the 
people who were uninsured in America 
and gave them the protection of health 
insurance, maybe for the first time in 
their lives. It provided health coverage 
to more than 20 million Americans. It 
has been a lifeline to families nation-
wide. 
Most people would say: Thank good-
ness Mr. Becerra supported it. For a 
man who wants to be Secretary of 
HHS, you would almost insist on that. 
And yet Republicans oppose his nomi-
nation because of that, and they also 
don’t like the fact that he was the at-
torney general of California and he en-
forced the State’s COVID–19 rules. How 
can defending public health rules dis-
qualify a person who wants to be Amer-
ica’s top public health official? 
We are in the midst of a lethal pan-
demic that has claimed nearly 530,000 
American lives. More people are in-
fected and dying every day. Is this any 
time to play politics with the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services? I 
don’t think so. 
Xavier Becerra is an effective man-
ager, a smart, thoughtful, passionate 
leader. He is the right person to lead 
the Department. He served in the U.S. 
House of Representatives for more than 
two decades. As California’s top pros-
ecutor in 2017, he took on the tobacco 
companies and the opioid manufactur-
ers—three cheers for him in both in-
stances—and 
he 
helped 
defend 
healthcare for families, women, and 
the LGBTQ community. 
In his confirmation hearing, Mr. 
Becerra highlighted his commitment 
to serving all Americans by expanding 
access to health insurance, lowering 
prescription drug prices, improving 
rural healthcare, and addressing racial 
and ethnic disparities in care. Would 
you expect anything less from a man 
who wants to lead our public health ef-
fort? 
When he is finally confirmed this 
week, after this unconscionable delay— 
and he will be confirmed—he will be 
the first Latino to serve as Secretary 
of HHS. His historic confirmation will 
be especially meaningful at this mo-
ment in time when Latinos are dis-
proportionately affected by the med-
ical and economic impact of COVID. 
Delaying his confirmation only hurts 
our Nation—still struggling to beat 
this pandemic; still working to get ev-
eryone vaccinated, to get our schools 
open, and everybody back to work. 
Sadly, these Republican Senators who 
have led this charge against him are 
demonstrating obstructionism at its 
worst and at the worst moment. 
I look forward to confirming Xavier 
Becerra to be Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. While my colleague 
Senator DURBIN is here, there is a real 
irony here to say that our Republican 
friends are not going to support Xavier 
Becerra because of his support of the 
Affordable Care Act. One key ingre-
dient of the Affordable Care Act is ac-
tually the exchanges to provide for 
those who don’t have access to cov-
erage from their employer or some 
other way to get in a group. 
But that was an idea that was intro-
duced in 1993 by 23 Republican Sen-
ators—23 Republican Senators—as an 
alternative to HillaryCare, and it never 
got anywhere. It never went anywhere 
until an enterprising Governor from 
Massachusetts—I heard about him— 
said: Here is a way one can enforce this 
and provide opportunities for the peo-
ple to get healthcare coverage that 
otherwise wouldn’t have it. He said 
this might work. And they introduced 
it as RomneyCare in the State of Mas-
sachusetts. And do you know what? It 
worked. It made healthcare coverage 
available to a lot of people, and it 
helped on the affordability side too. 
For our Republican friends to say 
that is the reason why—his support for 
the ACA, a key ingredient of which is 
the exchange—is an irony here. So I 
hope it is not lost on our friends. 
I thank Senator DURBIN
for those 
comments. 
Like my friend Senator DURBIN, I, 
too, rise in support of Attorney Gen-
eral Xavier Becerra, a longtime public 
servant and President Biden’s nominee 
to be our next Secretary of Health and 
Human Service. 
For a year now, I have been saying to 
anybody who would listen that the 
only way to really get our economy 
back on track, to put parents back to 
work, kids back in the classroom, and 
life back to normal in the United 
States of America is to do all that we 
can to put this devastating pandemic 
in our Nation’s rearview mirror. That 
means vaccinating as many at-risk 
Americans as safely and as quickly as 
possible. 
In fact, under the leadership of our 
new President, America is leading the 
way in the production and the distribu-
tion of vaccines. How about that—lead-
ing the world? 
Each day we are breaking records on 
the number of new Americans who are 
being vaccinated. After going through 
one of the darkest periods in American 
history, we are finally beginning to see 
the light at the end of the tunnel. But 
as we ramp up for actual distribution 
throughout America and help make 
sure that all people—all people from 
rural communities to urban cities— 
have equitable access to lifesaving vac-
cines, we need to make sure that the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1607 
March 17, 2021 
Department of Health and Human 
Services has the right leader at the 
helm going forward. And for my money 
and my judgment, that leader is Xavier 
Becerra. I believe he is the right person 
for this job at this point in our Na-
tion’s history. 
As a key member of the Biden admin-
istration, he will work with the White 
House. He will work with us in the Con-
gress to tackle the coronavirus pan-
demic and to coordinate our Nation’s 
response to it. 
Just as he has done throughout his 
career, he will fight to expand afford-
able 
healthcare, 
address 
persistent 
health disparities, and restore HHS’s 
mission to protect the health and well- 
being of all Americans. 
Madam President, I have heard sev-
eral of my Republican colleagues call-
ing into question Xavier Becerra’s—At-
torney General Becerra’s qualifications 
to serve as HHS Secretary. Obviously 
they are free to express their concerns. 
As Senators, it is our duty to vet and 
evaluate Cabinet nominees and make 
sure that we believe they are going to 
be best able to serve the American peo-
ple. I take the responsibility seriously. 
I know our Presiding Officer does as 
well. 
But 
let 
me 
set 
the 
record 
straight, if I could, on Xavier Becerra. 
I am confident that with his decades of 
experience 
working 
on 
healthcare 
issues in Congress and as California’s 
attorney general, he will be an invalu-
able part of President Biden’s adminis-
tration as we work together to combat 
the pandemic nationally. 
Some of the critics on the other side 
of the aisle say: What does he know 
about healthcare? Well, as it turns out, 
he served for I want to say two decades 
on the House Committee on Ways and 
Means. The last time I checked—you 
may want to double-check me on this— 
I think the primary responsibility of 
that committee is Medicare, and for 
somebody who served that long on that 
committee, I bet he knows a thing or 
two about Medicare. As it turns out, he 
does. 
Throughout his career in public serv-
ice, Xavier Becerra has shown an un-
wavering commitment to protecting 
and expanding healthcare availability 
for millions of American families and 
workers, especially those in vulnerable 
communities who remain underserved. 
In the House of Representatives, he 
was a senior member of the Ways and 
Means Committee, which helped to 
make the Affordable Care Act, which is 
based on a Republican idea, I think out 
of the Heritage Foundation in 1993 
that, as I mentioned earlier, MITT ROM-
NEY helped make a household word in 
the State of Massachusetts when he 
was Governor there. And I think half of 
the people who had healthcare cov-
erage—who didn’t have it when we cre-
ated the ACA have it. They have it 
today. We cut in half the number of 
people 
who 
don’t 
have 
access 
to 
healthcare coverage. 
In the State of Delaware, the cost of 
coverage is actually dropping in the ex-
changes. It has dropped by I think 19 
percent over the last 2 years alone, as 
market forces are taking place and 
taking hold. 
As attorney general of California, as 
has been mentioned, he led the charge 
for a coalition of States to defend the 
Affordable Care Act against multiple 
attempts by the Trump administration 
to dismantle this landmark legislation 
altogether. 
I once asked somebody—I asked him. 
I said: What is it about your experience 
that would suggest you could run a big 
operation 
like 
the 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services? 
He said: Well, I have run the Depart-
ment of Justice in California. It is the 
second largest Department of Justice 
in the country, second only to the Fed-
eral Department of Justice. 
I forget how many thousands—maybe 
tens of thousands—of employees they 
have, but it is a huge operation in a 
huge State with a ton of people. 
Xavier Becerra brought together at-
torneys general from both sides of the 
aisle to hold opioid manufacturers ac-
countable for the addiction crisis that 
we are still struggling with. 
When the pandemic hit, he went to 
bat for Californians on everything from 
protections for our workers from expo-
sure to COVID–19, increasing trans-
parency in nursing homes, to securing 
key safeguards for the rights of front-
line healthcare personnel. 
His past leadership is a major reason 
why President Biden is asking him 
today to accept the responsibilities of 
overseeing responses to many of our 
Nation’s most urgent needs, including 
the distribution of COVID–19 vaccina-
tions, restoring the public confidence 
in vital public health institutions, and 
boosting family health and financial 
security in the wake of the pandemic. 
With so much of the COVID–19 re-
sponse being executed at the State and 
local levels, we are fortunate that 
President Biden has chosen as his HHS 
Secretary Xavier Becerra, a leader 
with relevant, on-the-ground, State- 
based experience. 
As a former State treasurer, former 
Governor, former chairman of the Na-
tional Governors Association, to have 
somebody with this kind of State-based 
experience, what a blessing that would 
be. 
As the head of the largest State de-
partment of justice in the Nation, over-
seeing thousands of employees, Attor-
ney General Becerra has a proven track 
record and the management experience 
necessary to take on the massive oper-
ations at HHS. He will also make, as 
Senator DURBIN has mentioned, history 
as the first Latino American to take on 
this role, providing important perspec-
tive as Latinos and other minority 
communities continue to be dispropor-
tionately impacted by the pandemic. 
As we try to make sure that about a 
third of the American people who are 
saying they are not going to take the 
vaccine—they don’t care; they are 
going to take a chance—and a lot of 
those people are Latino—wouldn’t it be 
nice to have a Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
who could reach out to that commu-
nity, literally reach out to them and 
touch them and convince them that, 
no, this is something they should do; 
they should take this chance and be 
glad they did. 
Four years ago, this body confirmed 
President Trump’s nominee for Health 
and Human Services within just 20 
days—20 days from the start of his ad-
ministration. We knew then that this 
role was important to fill. It took us 20 
days. 
Now, in the midst of a deadly pan-
demic, one that has taken the lives of 
over 530,000 Americans—a toll that ex-
ceeds the number of American deaths 
on the battlefields of World War I, 
World War II, and the Vietnam war, in 
which I served—we cannot afford to let 
another day go by without confirming 
Xavier Becerra. 
With all of that, I just want to say, 
colleagues, it is time. It is over time, 
and we need to confirm Xavier. I 
think—in fact, I am convinced he will 
do a good job. He will make us proud. 
We need him. The President needs him. 
And with him on board as the leader of 
HHS, he can go to work on behalf of 
the American people and put this pan-
demic behind us for good, and we need 
that day to come soon. 
I don’t see anybody else waiting to 
speak. I think maybe I should suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NO HATE ACT 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, we are working today in the 
shadow of a truly hideous, horrific se-
ries of murders that occurred yester-
day in Atlanta, GA, and I want to start 
by expressing my sympathies to the 
families that are affected, families of 
innocent women who were gunned 
down heinously by a murderer there. 
Eight lives were taken by that gun-
man, six of them Asian women. 
There is an active, ongoing investiga-
tion, and I have no intention of pre-
judging the outcome. Justice must be 
done, and I have confidence in the law 
enforcement authorities of Atlanta 
that they will assure that justice is 
done. 
So we don’t know for sure what the 
gunman’s motivation was, but we know 
eight of the women were Asian, and we 
know for sure that this horrific shoot-
ing rampage is only the latest egre-
gious incident in a sickening, des-
picable trend of anti-Asian-American, 
or AAPI, violence that has terrorized 
the Asian-American community over 
recent months. 
And we know many of these incidents 
were, in fact, hate crimes motivated by

bias, bigotry, and prejudice. Now, hate- 
motivated violence, as Attorney Gar-
land said at his confirmation hearing, 
‘‘tear[s] at the fabric of our society . . . 
make[s] our citizens worried about 
walking [on] the streets and exercising 
even the most normal rights.’’ 
And he is absolutely correct. It tears 
at our society. It degrades our trust in 
each other and in the fairness of Amer-
ica and the survivability of values and 
rights that are central to our democ-
racy. 
The increase in violence against 
Asian Americans must end, and we all 
know it. We all say it, but we must do 
it. In Congress, we must do everything 
in our power to provide law enforce-
ment and prosecutors with the re-
sources and the tools they need to 
overcome it, to successfully fight it, 
which they can do. And they need the 
will and determination to wield the 
tools and resources that we give them 
because they have to not only inves-
tigate, as they will this gunman, but 
also to effectively prosecute and assure 
just punishment. 
We don’t know for sure the motiva-
tion. We have evidence. And we can’t 
say for sure how many hate crimes 
there have been against Asian Ameri-
cans or others in our great country, 
but we have a pretty good idea where it 
all came from. 
The rise in anti-Asian-American vio-
lence started with the previous admin-
istration, who failed to address and 
manage the COVID–19 pandemic, and 
rather than listen to the scientists and 
work to stop its spread, it sought to 
scapegoat a part of our country. It 
sought to scapegoat Asian Americans 
with xenophobic and hate-filled rhet-
oric. 
Words have consequences. We all say 
it. We all know it. And we must de-
nounce the words that spur and spew 
hatred and cause or contribute to hate 
crimes. Hate crimes are a growing 
scourge. The numbers are surging, 
whether it is against Asian Americans, 
Muslim Americans, Jewish Americans, 
Black Americans. When it is against 
Americans, it is against America. 
Words do have consequences. 
Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks vio-
lence and harassment against the AAPI 
community, Asian Americans, received 
more than 1,100 reports of COVID-re-
lated harassment, discrimination, and 
assault in its first two operational 
weeks last March. And now it has re-
corded more than 3,800 incidents since 
the start of the pandemic—3,800 inci-
dents of harassment, discrimination, 
and 
sometimes 
physical 
assault— 
spurred and encouraged and condoned 
by public officials who used that hate- 
filled rhetoric to cover their own fail-
ures in dealing with the pandemic. 
As the investigators and prosecutors 
go forward, we will learn more, and we 
need to let them do their jobs. But that 
doesn’t mean we should remain silent, 
nor does it give us an excuse to be 
inert. We need to denounce that kind of 
rhetoric. We need to take action. 
I have proposed a measure called the 
NO HATE Act, which would provide 
more training for investigators and 
more resources for hotlines because 
these hate crimes are typically and re-
peatedly unreported, and it would pro-
vide more incentives for reporting and 
new penalties—or encourage the impo-
sition of penalties—that truly fit the 
crime. 
Hate crimes are corrosive to our so-
cial fabric. They corrupt the pillars of 
our society, and their effect is unmis-
takable. 
They traumatize and terrorize the 
communities that are their targets—in 
this case, Asian Americans, who have 
become more and more fearful as these 
incidents have multiplied. We all have 
a part to do in stopping this scourge. 
And we know that it is rampant, in 
part, because of the White suprema-
cists and domestic terrorism and vio-
lent extremism that showed its ugly 
face in this Chamber earlier this year. 
It showed its brutal, cruel force in this 
building. 
It is the same virus and cancer that 
is metastasizing in this country today. 
And its visible forms are the assaults, 
harassment, and discrimination that 
may well have been reflected in those 
murders yesterday. 
I hope the NO HATE Act passes, but 
it won’t be for a while. I hope we can 
take other action, but it will take 
time. And in the meantime, we can all 
take it as a moral imperative as our 
duty to denounce—not condoned by our 
silence—these groups and their extrem-
ist ideologies in White supremacists 
that perpetuate and expand the virus 
and cancer of hate crimes and hatred. 
Hate speech—fighting words—incite-
ment in our society. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Now, a bright spot for America today 
is the confirmation, which we hope will 
happen in the next 24 hours, of the first 
Latino Secretary of Health and Human 
Services in America, the first. He was 
the first in his working-class family to 
go 
to 
college. 
He 
broke 
barriers 
throughout his career. 
Xavier Becerra, presently the attor-
ney general of California, will be a 
leader of toughness, bravery, and vi-
sion at the Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
I stand here as a former attorney 
general, actually, for 20 years. I know 
well how much of that job is spent on 
healthcare policy, and I know also the 
management skills it takes to achieve 
real concrete results. 
Attorney General Becerra is deeply 
qualified because of his work as State 
attorney general, but he also enjoys a 
wealth of other experience, both per-
sonal and professional, that make him 
exactly the right person at this mo-
ment for that job. He knows the impor-
tance 
of 
healthcare—equitable 
healthcare, reducing the disparities in 
healthcare in our country that afflict 
us now. 
We have been in a healthcare crisis 
for more than a year, the deepest, most 
painful healthcare crisis in our lives 
and maybe for a full century, a time of 
heartbreak and hardship, when a dead-
ly, insidious virus has threatened eco-
nomic upheaval and disaster. It is a 
pandemic that has left no family un-
touched, as all of us in this Chamber 
know, and no community unscathed. 
We have lost more than half a mil-
lion of our fellow citizens and people to 
COVID–19, including 7,800-plus in Con-
necticut. While there is light at the 
end of the tunnel, each day brings a 
new loss. And we don’t know how long 
that tunnel may be. 
The Biden administration has been 
laser-focused on ending this pandemic 
since day one. Every day, more and 
more Americans are receiving the vac-
cine. Every day, more and more Ameri-
cans are beginning to see the big, bold 
benefits of the American Rescue Plan 
that President Biden signed last week, 
and every day we are seeing strong 
leadership from the Biden administra-
tion in addressing this deep crisis. 
While there is hope at this moment, 
there are immense healthcare chal-
lenges still to be overcome, from in-
creasing healthcare affordability and 
reducing the uninsured rate to low-
ering drug costs, to fighting back 
against healthcare disparities and pro-
tecting reproductive rights, and, I 
would repeat, lowering prescription 
drug costs. Job No. 1 for America, low-
ering prescription drug costs. Job No. 
2, lowering prescription drug costs. We 
need to reduce the prices of medicine 
that Americans need every day, aside 
from the pandemic, every day. Pre-
scription drug prices plague them, 
cause them worry, force them to make 
tough choices between eating and using 
the medicine, paying their rent, and 
buying the drugs they need to survive. 
Attorney General Becerra served as 
deputy attorney general in California 
and later as a member of the State as-
sembly before he went to the House of 
Representatives, here in the Capitol, 
for more than two decades. As a Con-
gressman—and I think this point is 
really important—then-Representative 
Xavier Becerra fought to pass the Af-
fordable Care Act, and then he fought 
to defend it against the Trump admin-
istration. 
As California’s attorney general, he 
was a warrior in fighting to preserve 
the ACA, and he will continue to fight 
for the men and women who depend on 
the ACA. And more and more of them, 
fortunately, are taking advantage of it 
because of the American Rescue Plan. 
He is also a leader in taking on Big 
Tobacco. I sued the tobacco companies, 
helped to lead a multi-State attorney 
general group, and I know it takes 
courage to stand up and speak out and 
act against Big Tobacco. And he has 
done more. He has taken that fight to 
a new frontier. He is committed to pro-
tecting our children from the scourge 
of flavored tobacco and the insidious 
products—often they are flavored too— 
that are sold by vaping giants, which 
now include some tobacco companies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1609 
March 17, 2021 
Attorney General Becerra is a leader 
in protecting reproductive rights. He is 
a 
leader 
in 
expanding 
mental 
healthcare services. He is a leader in 
the fight against the opioid epidemic. 
He is a leader for LGBTQ health and 
for ending the disparities. 
We are in a racial justice movement 
now, a racial justice movement that is 
seeking to end those deep disparities, 
causing twice as many people in com-
munities of color to die during the pan-
demic and only half as many now to 
have the vaccine so far because we 
have lived through 4 years of dishon-
esty and disregard for science and 4 
years of attacks on our healthcare sys-
tem, particularly for the underserved. 
That is the challenge, among others, 
that Attorney General Becerra will 
confront. He will be vigorous, brave, 
and tough, and he will work to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. He will 
take on those interests that may be 
against the healthcare goals and pur-
poses of the American people. And we 
need him now more than ever in this 
critical position. I urge my colleagues 
to vote for him tomorrow when we 
have the chance to do so. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from California. 
GEORGIA SHOOTINGS 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I want 
to begin by joining with so many of our 
colleagues and leaders around the 
country expressing our condolences to 
the victims of the senseless shootings 
in Atlanta yesterday, in sharing our 
thoughts and prayers to their families 
and friends. Our heart goes out to the 
greater community, and, of course, we 
stand here to not only try to under-
stand better what happened, how it 
happened, but do the work necessary to 
try to ensure that it doesn’t happen 
again—not in Atlanta, not anywhere in 
the United States of America. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak 
in support of the nomination of my 
friend California Attorney General Xa-
vier Becerra to serve as Secretary of 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
As we all know, as we all feel, our 
Nation is going through one of the 
toughest health crises in our history. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taken an 
incredible toll on our country. Every 
State has been impacted. Every com-
munity has suffered, especially work-
ing-class communities and commu-
nities of color, like the very neighbor-
hoods that Attorney General Becerra 
and I grew up in. These communities 
are hurting and people are dying at 
alarming rates, and they desperately 
need someone who knows these com-
munities to their core. 
Throughout 
his 
career, 
Xavier 
Becerra has always fought to improve 
the lives of his constituents. As the 
first Latino attorney general of Cali-
fornia, he made it his mission to tackle 
the 
structural 
inequalities 
in 
our 
healthcare system. As has been ref-
erenced 
already, 
Attorney 
General 
Becerra was the leading force behind 
the lawsuit to protect the Affordable 
Care Act. Yes, he had the audacity to 
maintain protections for people with 
preexisting conditions and for those 
suffering from a mental illness. Over 
the course of this past year, he has also 
fought to protect frontline healthcare 
workers 
from 
further 
exposure 
to 
COVID–19. 
Xavier Becerra’s parents emigrated 
from Mexico, just like my parents did, 
with a dream of building a better life 
for themselves and their family. Just a 
few days ago, I spoke in this Chamber 
about my family’s history and journey 
in this country. A hard-working short- 
order cook and housekeeper raised the 
son who now serves in the U.S. Senate. 
The same is true for Xavier Becerra’s 
family. He, the son of a construction 
and clerical worker, is on the verge of 
becoming the most important health 
official in our Nation. That is the 
American dream. 
But, unfortunately, tragically, over 
half a million Americans have had 
their dream cut short by COVID–19, 
over half a million lives lost and mil-
lions more lives upended by this pan-
demic. We need to act with urgency to 
end this crisis—urgency. 
But as I rise today to address this 
Chamber, urgency is severely lacking. 
While millions of Americans continue 
to struggle, our Republican colleagues 
are dragging things out, playing poli-
tics with the confirmation of Attorney 
General Becerra, one of the most quali-
fied nominees to lead the Department 
of Health and Human Services that 
this Chamber has ever considered. 
They have distorted his record. 
Let me point out that many Members 
of this Senate have worked alongside 
Xavier Becerra here in Congress for 
decades. Republicans and Democrats 
know Xavier Becerra is both a thought-
ful leader and someone who is always 
willing to listen to both sides of an ar-
gument. He built an outstanding rep-
utation in the House, both as a legis-
lator and as a colleague. 
As attorney general of California, 
overseeing the largest department of 
justice in the Nation, second only to 
the U.S. Department of Justice, Xavier 
showed no fear in working across the 
aisle. In fact, he partnered with Repub-
lican attorneys general to increase ac-
cess 
to 
lifesaving 
drugs 
to 
treat 
COVID–19. He worked across the aisle 
to protect drug discounts for health 
centers. 
I can’t help but point out the obvi-
ous. In fact, I am prepared to make 
this abundantly clear to the American 
people. The cynical delays and political 
games that we see being played are not 
actually about Mr. Becerra’s qualifica-
tions. He is just as qualified as any of 
his predecessors. Sadly, Xavier Becerra 
is being held to a different standard—a 
different standard than other nominees 
this Chamber has supported and con-
firmed over the last 4 years, including 
our most recent Health and Human 
Services Secretary. 
Let me also say this. As some of the 
first Latinos in our respective posi-
tions, both Xavier and I are not unfa-
miliar with being held to a different 
standard. It is a different standard 
today that is so stark that our col-
leagues are willing to delay his con-
firmation through the night. Yes, in 
the middle of a global health pandemic, 
Republicans are holding up the nomi-
nee for Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. They are holding up the first 
Latino nominee to head this critical 
agency during a pandemic that has dis-
proportionately devastated the Latino 
community. 
It is time to let Xavier Becerra get to 
work. I urge my colleagues to end the 
delay on Xavier Becerra’s confirmation 
for Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

States as graduate students and re-
mained here to make a better life for 
themselves and their family, her father 
as a researcher at the Walter Reed Na-
tional Military Medical Center and her 
mother as a scientist for the National 
Institutes of Health. 
Given her parents’ background, Kath-
erine is no stranger to public service, 
and through her parents’ hard work 
and dedication to make a better life for 
their daughter, she was able to attend 
Yale University and Harvard Law, be-
came a talented trade lawyer, and was 
nominated by President Biden to lead 
the Office of the U.S. Trade Represent-
ative. I have a deep appreciation for 
the Tais, their work ethic and their 
commitment to family. Representation 
matters, and Ms. Tai will be a rep-
resentative for the United States in 
more ways than one. 
Ms. Tai is a highly-qualified nominee 
with the experience to lead the U.S. 
trade policy at a critical time for our 
country, specifically as we continue to 
recover from the damage wrought by 
the coronavirus pandemic and rebuild 
our 
relationships 
with 
our 
allies 
abroad. She is a person who can help 
mend relationships and restore alli-
ances. 
Supporters have described her as a 
knowledgeable, tenacious trade expert 
who will work with a cross-section of 
advocates and stakeholders with the 
goal of bettering the lives of the Amer-
ican people and strengthening our 
economy at all levels. They have de-
scribed her willingness to build coali-
tions across party lines, highlighting 
her broad support from both Democrats 
and Republicans, and from the labor, 
business, and environmental commu-
nities. They have referred to her time 
as a trade lawyer at the Office of the 
U.S. Trade Representative, where she 
worked to enforce trade agreements 
with China to hold that country ac-
countable before the World Trade Orga-
nization. They have highlighted her 
time as a lawyer with the House Ways 
and Means Committee, where she built 
partnerships and crafted agreements 
that received broad bipartisan ap-
proval. These included the U.S.-Mex-
ico-Canada Trade Agreement, which 
passed the Senate by an 89–10 vote and 
the House by a 385–41 vote. Ms. Tai 
played a key role in crafting the agree-
ment, which speaks to her skills and 
experience. 
Perhaps more importantly, however, 
Ms. Tai will prioritize trade policies 
that promote workers, families, the en-
vironment, and local communities. I 
met with Ms. Tai just after President 
Biden nominated her, and during our 
conversation, it was clear she under-
stands that trade policies have real 
world implications for everyday people. 
She knows that if trade deals are not 
working for people, then they need to 
change. People need to come first as we 
develop trade deals. At a time when 
people are still working to recover 
from the coronavirus, Ms. Tai is the 
Trade Representative we need for the 
United States. 
A family emergency has prevented 
me from being here for today’s vote, 
but if I were present, I would have 
voted to confirm Katherine Tai as U.S. 
Trade Representative. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port her nomination.∑ 
f 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise 
today 
in 
support 
of 
Xavier 
Becerra’s nomination to be Secretary 
of the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
I am proud to have known Xavier 
Becerra for many years as both a friend 
and colleague. He has spent decades 
serving California, including as the 
State’s attorney general and as a 12- 
term Congressman from Los Angeles. 
Mr. Becerra was the first in his fam-
ily to receive a 4-year college degree, 
earning his bachelor of arts in econom-
ics from Stanford University and, 
later, his juris doctorate from Stanford 
Law School. As a member of the House 
of Representatives, he was a strong ad-
vocate for the healthcare of his con-
stituents and fought to make the Af-
fordable Care Act law. And as Cali-
fornia attorney general he has been a 
staunch defender of the Affordable Care 
Act, leading 20 States and the District 
of Columbia in defense of the Afford-
able Care Act before the Supreme 
Court. 
As part of his focus on protecting the 
health of Americans, Mr. Becerra has 
worked on a bipartisan basis with 
multistate coalitions of attorneys gen-
eral on issues still affecting our coun-
try today. These include the need to re-
duce youth exposure to tobacco prod-
ucts like e-cigarettes, increasing ac-
cess to COVID–19 treatments, as well 
as addressing the opioid epidemic and 
the considerable harm it has caused 
families. 
As our State’s attorney general, Mr. 
Becerra has led the Nation’s second 
largest department of justice behind 
only the U.S. Department of Justice. 
His experience leading large and di-
verse organizations will position him 
to successfully lead the Department of 
Health and Human Services, which is 
the Nation’s largest Federal agency by 
budget. 
As Secretary, he will lead the Na-
tion’s top health agency charged with 
enhancing the health and well-being of 
all Americans. In this global pandemic, 
he will play a lead role in overseeing 
the 
implementation 
of 
President 
Biden’s national strategy for COVID–19 
response, which is vital to defeating 
the virus that has plagued our country 
for far too long. His history-making 
nomination as the first Latino to man-
age this Department comes at a time 
when this pandemic is affecting com-
munities of color at much higher rates 
than white Americans. And those of us 
who know him personally know the 
level of his concern and the strength of 
his dedication to protect the health 
and safety of all hard-working Ameri-
cans and their families. 
In short, Xavier Becerra is the right 
candidate to lead the Department of 
Health and Human Services at this 
time, and I strongly urge the Senate to 
confirm his nomination. Thank you. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today I rise to speak in support of Xa-
vier Becerra’s nomination to serve s 
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices, HHS. 
Attorney General Becerra will bring 
a fresh perspective to HHS at a critical 
time during this pandemic. While there 
is light at the end of the tunnel with 
the distribution of the corona virus 
vaccines, there is still work to do to 
end this pandemic and put our country 
on a road to recovery, and that is 
where Attorney General Becerra’s lead-
ership will be crucial. 
Attorney General Becerra’s 12 terms 
in the U.S. House of Representatives 
gave him a solid foundation in knowing 
how to set agendas and achieve results, 
which we saw deployed in his work as a 
key leader on the Committee on Ways 
and Means ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Social Security, and 
chair of the House Democratic caucus. 
He helped to expand the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program, modernize 
and strengthen Medicare, and helped 
pass the Affordable Care Act. His com-
mitment to the letter and spirit of this 
law is something he carried into his 
role as California attorney general, 
fighting to maintain his State’s ability 
to bring millions of previously unin-
sured residents under the Affordable 
Care Act’s umbrella. 
Last November, he led the defense of 
the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. Su-
preme Court on behalf of 20 States and 
the District of Columbia. His tweet 
after the oral arguments concisely 
sums up the national importance of his 
effort: ‘‘The ACA saves lives. It is the 
law of the land.’’ He brings a strong 
commitment to using the law and regu-
latory tools to make access to health 
care and other vital services equi-
table—the very thing that makes our 
Nation strong. 
I look forward to working with him 
on ensuring that everyone has access 
to quality and affordable healthcare, 
and I know he will be a partner in the 
fight against the corona virus and our 
goal of getting all eligible Americans 
vaccinated, 
even 
in 
hard-to-reach 
areas. 
Last week, President Biden signed 
into law the American Rescue Plan 
Act, which included major funding to 
address the—Nation’s worsening men-
tal health and addiction crisis. This is 
a high priority of mine and an issue 
which Attorney General Becerra has 
firsthand experience. He started his ca-
reer as a legal aid attorney in Massa-
chusetts, supporting clients contending 
with mental health issues. I am eager 
to work with him on this issue. 
Addressing the skyrocketing costs of 
prescription drugs is another area 
where Attorney General Becerra has 
shown key leadership. He and I share a 
belief that fairer competition means

March 17, 2021 
increased access to affordable prescrip-
tion drugs and better public health. As 
California attorney general, he inves-
tigated and brought enforcement ac-
tions against drug manufacturers’ anti- 
competitive business practices to help 
reduce drug prices and ensure that peo-
ple have access to the drugs they need. 
In March 2020, he led a bipartisan group 
of 46 States attorneys general who suc-
cessfully advocated before the U.S. Su-
preme Court to uphold the rights of 
States to regulate and address the ris-
ing cost of prescription drugs. 
The United States must do more to 
ensure that new technologies have ap-
propriate privacy and security protec-
tions for health data. At a September 
2020 hearing on the need for Federal 
data privacy legislation, Attorney Gen-
eral Becerra told me and other mem-
bers of the Senate Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation 
that ‘‘every consumer should be able to 
own and control his or her data’’ and 
that ‘‘if we decide that we don’t want 
anyone to use [our data], it’s our 
choosing.’’ His testimony was reas-
suring, and I look forward to working 
with him to ensure consumers can have 
a peace of mind when it comes to the 
security of their personal health data. 
Given the pandemic’s spotlight on 
the vulnerability of our Nation’s sen-
iors, I am eager to work with the Biden 
administration to improve the safety 
and weTI-being of older Americans. 
When my 92–year-old dad living in a 
memory care facility was diagnosed 
with COVID–19 last year, I was only 
able to visit him through a window. He 
recognized me, but he just didn’t un-
derstand why we couldn’t be in the 
same room together. Tens of thousands 
of families have been through these 
wrenching situations over the past 
year and want to see the Federal Gov-
ernment doing more. Attorney General 
Becerra recently moved to make the 
California Department of Justice Med-
icaid Fraud Control Unit a full-fledged 
division, underscoring his commitment 
to protecting seniors and people with 
disabilities. I know his leadership will 
place the needs of seniors front and 
center. 
Attorney General Becerra has the ex-
pertise and experience and the enforce-
ment and regulatory savvy to handle 
the job of protecting public health, 
strengthening 
our 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare system, making sure people 
have 
access 
to 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare, 
and 
supporting 
our 
healthcare workers. And as the first 
Latino to lead the Department of 
Health and Human Services, he will 
bring a personal understanding of the 
immediate need for equitable access to 
care. 
With that, I ask my colleagues to 
support 
the 
nomination 
of 
Xavier 
Becerra to be Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. 
CONFIRMATION OF ISABELLA 
CASILLAS GUZMAN 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to support the confirmation 
of Isabel Guzman, a dedicated public 
servant and successful small business-
woman, to lead the Small Business Ad-
ministration. 
Small businesses are a cornerstone of 
Maryland’s economy, creating jobs, 
driving innovation, and anchoring com-
munities. Isabel Guzman’s extensive 
leadership experience serving at SBA 
under the Obama administration and 
running her own small businesses posi-
tions her well to support our small 
business communities as we finish the 
fight against the COVID–19 pandemic 
and address the unique challenges 
faced by women- and minority-owned 
small businesses across Maryland. 
In her new role as SBA Adminis-
trator, she will inherit an economic 
crisis compounded by a mismanaged 
pandemic that has devastated the 
small business community from retail 
to restaurants and bars to sole-propri-
etorships. She will be charged not only 
with administering critical small busi-
ness relief programs, including the 
Economic Injury Disaster Loan Pro-
gram and the Paycheck Protection

REMEMBERING LARRY ‘‘CLIZ’’ 
CLISBY 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor and recognize the distin-
guished legacy of Larry ‘‘Cliz’’ Clisby, 
who passed away on February 27, 2021, 
at the age of 74 after a valiant fight 
against 
cancer. 
Famously 
known 
across the State of Indiana as the leg-
endary Voice of the Boilermakers, he 
will forever be remembered for his un-
matched play-by-play commentary of 
Purdue basketball and his trademark 
‘‘Bullseye!’’ calls during crunch time. 
Born and raised in Ohio, Larry grad-
uated 
from 
Warren 
Howland 
High 
School and Kent State University. 
Shortly after college and service in the 
U.S. Army, Larry started his broad-
casting career in Paducah, KY. How-
ever, his time in Paducah was brief, as 
he moved to West Lafayette, IN, to 
work for WLFI-TV in the sports de-
partment in 1977. During his early ca-
reer in the Lafayette area, Larry called 
high school basketball games and as-
sisted during Purdue sports broadcasts. 
It wasn’t until 1982 that Larry became 
the full-time radio announcer for the 
Boilermakers. 
Over the course of nearly 40 years, 
Larry called a total of 1,890 Purdue 
men’s basketball games, including doz-
ens of high-profile Indiana vs. Purdue 
rivalry games. Since the 1980s, Larry 
was involved in many of Purdue’s his-
toric moments, including one Big Ten 
Tournament title, nine Big Ten Cham-
pionship 
Seasons, 
28 
NCAA 
Tour-
naments, and three Elite Eight appear-
ances. In 2018, he was inducted into the 
Indiana 
Sportswriters 
and 
Sports-
casters Hall of Fame, and he received 
one of Indiana’s highest honors, the 
Sagamore of the Wabash, from Gov-
ernor Eric Holcomb in 2020. 
From the Purdue sports staff to the 
team players, everyone saw Larry as a 
true, dedicated Boilermaker and not 
just a typical play-by-play announcer. 
Throughout his career, Larry devoted 
his charisma, talents, and life to the 
Lafayette community, and I believe his 
work will serve as a benchmark for 
those who aspire to join the field of 
sports radio. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in ex-
tending our sympathies to Larry’s 
wife, Michelle; his children, Chad and 
Carly; his sister, Carol; his step-
children and grandchildren; and all of 
his family and friends as they mourn 
his loss. And to Larry’s Purdue Univer-
sity family, I wish his beloved Boiler-
makers many, many ‘‘Bullseye!’’ mo-
ments in the years to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MARGARET HUETTL 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, as we 
observe 
National 
Women’s 
History 
Month throughout March, it gives me 
great pleasure to recognize one of 
North Dakota’s own history makers. 
Margaret Huettl from Minot has be-
come my State’s first female Eagle 
Scout and is a member of the inaugural 
class of young women to receive this 
high honor across the United States. 
Margaret is a member of Scout Troop 
5401 of the Northern Lights Council. A 
recent graduate of Minot High School, 
Margaret is currently studying biology 
education at Minot State University. 
Despite 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic, 
which limited many Scouting group ac-
tivities over the past year, she contin-
ued pressing on toward her goal of 
completing the merit badges necessary 
to earn the award. For her Eagle Scout 
project, she spent 238 hours building a 
pit for gaga ball, which is a variation 
of dodgeball, for outdoor activities at 
her home church, Zion Lutheran. 
She said earning the 21 merit badges, 
along with completing her project and 
the other requirements for the Eagle 
Scout Award, helped her further de-
velop leadership, time management, 
and communication skills. She intends 
to continue her involvement with 
Troop 5401, transitioning to an adult 
leader this year. 
I congratulate Margaret on achieving 
this award through hard work and per-
sistence and a being a trailblazer for 
other young women who have an inter-
est in the Scouting program. With only 
6 percent of all scouts attaining the 
rank of Eagle Scout, she now will be 
recognized alongside the 2.5 million

others who have earned this pres-
tigious award since it was created in 
1911. She will learn, as have other 
Eagle Scouts, that throughout her life, 
this accomplishment will bring her rec-
ognition as being a person of the high-
est caliber and character. I fully expect 
to hear much more from Margaret in 
the future as she excels in academic, 
professional, and personal endeavors.∑

RECOGNIZING BISSON’S SUGAR 
HOUSE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I 
would like to recognize Bisson’s Sugar 
House, a New Hampshire institution 
that is celebrating its 100th anniver-
sary. March is Maple Month in New 
Hampshire, 
where 
maple 
producers 
across our State produce more than 
90,000 gallons of maple syrup, and the 
Bisson family represents three genera-
tions of this great and tasty tradition. 
Lazzare Bisson and his nephew Ar-
mand found Bisson’s Sugar House in 
Berlin in 1921, and ran the business to-
gether 
successfully 
for 
15 
years. 
Lazzare then passed the business on to 
Armand and his wife, Juliette. In 1953, 
they constructed a new sugar house to 
support their growing business, and 
since then, they have welcomed fami-
lies from New Hampshire and beyond 
to see their work each spring. 
The Bisson family has prioritized 
preserving the traditional sugaring ex-
perience, while also modernizing their 
operations in order to provide high- 
quality, delicious maple products to 
their customers. Each year, the Bisson 
family taps more than 3,000 trees, and 
they still boil their sap on a wood-fired 
evaporator built by Armand and Juli-
ette more than 50 years ago. During the 
height of the sugaring season in March 
and April, they make candy with the 
same evaporator they have used since 
the 1940s. 
Since 1988, Bisson’s Sugar House has 
been run by Armand and Juliette 
Bisson’s niece Muriel and her husband 
Lucien Blais. For many families, an 
annual trip to Bisson’s Sugar House 
marks the beginning of spring. As the 
sugar business has passed from genera-
tion to generation, the Bisson family’s 
work has encouraged Granite Staters 
to treasure our past and embrace the 
future. 
I hope you will join me in celebrating 
the 100th anniversary of Bisson’s Sugar 
House and sending them best wishes for 
a successful harvest and many more 
years of sharing their traditions with 
the people of New Hampshire.∑

TRIBUTE TO WALTER FRANK 
YORK 
∑ Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, on Mon-
day, March 15, the community of Ash-
land, KS, celebrated the career of 
someone who dedicated nearly 45 years 
to the Stockgrowers State Bank. Wal-
ter Frank York has called Ashland 
home since the day he was born. His 
parents, Russell and Marjorie, brought 
him up in a modest home on a farmer’s 
income during the 1950s and 1960s. 
Frank, as he came to be called by his 
family and friends, went on to study fi-
nance at Kansas State University, but 
the Vietnam war draft up-ended his 
plans before graduation. 
Frank ultimately did not serve due 
to a back injury incurred while playing 
football for Ashland High, but the draft 
experience took him to Eagle County, 
CO, where he used his education to as-
sist his sister with a new business that 
she was operating in Vail Village near 
the well-known ski resort. While tak-
ing on this challenge in Colorado, he 
finished his degree at CU Boulder, de-
spite his long-lasting love for the K- 
State Wildcats. After earning his de-
gree, his route led back home when he 
applied for a vacant position at a bank 
in 
Ashland. 
His 
first 
day 
at 
Stockgrowers State Bank was March 
15, 1976. 
Working as a loans officer, Frank 
added a sense of small-town care for 
each of his customers over the years. 
After all, he would frequently see his 
customers at church, at the grocery 
store, and at Friday night sporting 
events in Ashland and surrounding 
communities in southwest Kansas. In 
2007, he earned the title of executive 
vice president after years of loyally 
helping customers. One recent high-
light from his career was being award-
ed as a recipient of the Pioneer Award 
in early 2020, which is given annually 
by the Kansas Ag Bankers division of 
the Kansas Bankers Association. When 
he achieved the award, one customer of 
his remarked to the Kansas Ag Bank-
ers: ‘‘Frank just makes it simple to do 
business and helps keep me connected 
to the Ashland community.’’ In return, 
Frank likes to share that his clients 
and colleagues became ‘‘family’’ to 
him. Being surrounded by good people 
in an enjoyable community helped 
keep Frank at Stockgrowers for the en-
tirety of his banking career. 
I would be remiss if I did not speak of 
community involvement while sharing 
about Frank York. Whether it was 
being involved in his children’s Boy 
Scouts troop, coaching local youth 
baseball programs in the summer, an-
nouncing football games for Ashland 
High, broadcasting SPIAA League high 
school 
basketball 
tournaments, 
or 
serving on the board of organizations 
near and far in Kansas, Frank has done 
it all. He currently serves on the board 
for KJIL Great Plains Christian Radio, 
in addition to the Kansas Leadership 
Center’s board, and serves as president 
of the alumni board for his K-State 
chapter of Delta Upsilon fraternity. 
I have had the joy of getting to know 
Frank on a more personal level in this 
past decade, as his son Tyler joined my 
staff after earning his degree at K- 
State. Frank lives in the same farm-
house that his grandfather built in 
1912, just a few miles outside of Ash-
land. Farming and ranching has been a 
side passion and a hobby for him since 
he returned home for a career at 
Stockgrowers. It is something that he 
intends to continue for years ahead, 
thanks to the local volunteer fire-
fighters 
that 
spared 
the 
York 
farmstead from destruction in March 
2017 as wildfires burned close to 80 per-
cent of Clark County. He considers 
himself blessed to have been of the 
more fortunate residents of the area. 
While I have appreciated his friendship 
over the years, Frank was an invalu-
able resource to me in the aftermath of 
the Starbuck Fire. Along with many 
others from Clark County, he informed 
me on ways we could help direct the 
USDA and other governmental agen-
cies to coordinate in providing assist-
ance to those that were severely af-
fected. 
The 
announcement 
of 
retirement 
from Frank came in mid-2020. His emo-
tional final day at Stockgrowers State 
Bank was on December 31, 2020. Due to 
the 
challenges 
that 
the 
pandemic 
brought to communities of all sizes, a 
celebration of his retirement, unfortu-
nately, had to be postponed. However, I 
couldn’t think of a better date to cele-
brate the career of Frank York than 
the 45th anniversary of his first day of 
employment at Stockgrowers State 
Bank. While the difficulties of the pan-
demic will still prevent many well- 
wishers from making it to Ashland to 
personally offer their congratulations, 
I know that the amount of lives that 
have been positively affected by Frank 
are plenty and stretch far beyond Ash-
land. His family—including wife, Sue, 
and children Joshua, Tyler, Emily, 
Adam, and Jennifer—should all be ex-
tremely proud of Frank’s career. I offer 
my sincere congratulations to someone 
I am proud to call my friend, Frank 
York.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. SCHATZ (for himself and 
Mr. THUNE): 
S. 797. A bill to require transparency, 
accountability, 
and 
protections 
for 
consumers online; to the Committee on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transpor-
tation. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, social 
media platforms have become a pretty 
significant part of Americans’ lives. We 
use them to stay up to date on news 
from friends and family—something 
that has become especially essential 
during the pandemic—to communicate 
with relatives and friends, for enter-
tainment, and as a shopping resource. 
Social media sites provide ways to net-
work, to connect with like-minded in-
dividuals from fellow theater lovers to 
fellow basketball fans, to advocate for 
causes that we believe in, to conduct 
business, even to date, and more and 
more we rely on social media sites as a 
primary source of news and informa-
tion, from Presidential election news 
to updates on COVID vaccinations. 
Social media offers a lot of benefits 
and opportunities, but the increasing 
dominance of social media, particu-
larly in the news and information 
space, has also raised concerns. Con-
sumers have become increasingly trou-
bled about the way their information is 
used by social media platforms and 
how these sites decide what news and 
information we see. And there are in-
creasing numbers of anecdotes to sug-
gest that some social media platforms 
are moderating content in a biased or 
political way. 
Currently, content moderation on so-
cial media platforms is governed by 
section 230 of the Communications De-
cency Act, which was enacted into law 
25 years ago. Section 230 provides inter-
net sites that host user-generated con-
tent—sites like YouTube or Twitter or 
Facebook—with immunity for the con-
tent that users post on their sites. So, 
for example, if somebody posts a video 
on YouTube that contains illegal con-
tent, YouTube isn’t held legally re-
sponsible for that content. 
Section 230 has been critical to the 
development of the internet as we 
know it today. Without section 230 pro-
tections, many of the sites we rely on 
for social connection or news or enter-
tainment would never have come into 
being.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1616 
March 17, 2021 
But as the internet and social media 
have grown and developed, it has also 
become clear that some changes need 
to be made. In particular, it has be-
come increasingly clear that sites need 
to provide greater transparency when 
it comes to their content moderation 
practices and decisions. Social media 
sites are no longer just providing a 
platform for user-generated content as 
they did in their infancy. They are now 
making a lot of decisions about that 
content and carefully shaping our so-
cial media experience—what ads we 
see, what posts we see, what news sto-
ries we see. 
Currently, Federal law does not re-
quire that social media sites be at all 
accountable to consumers for those 
content moderation decisions. That is 
why, today, I am introducing the Plat-
form Accountability and Consumer 
Transparency Act, or the PACT Act, 
along 
with 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
SCHATZ. Our bill would preserve the 
benefits of section 230, like the internet 
growth and widespread dissemination 
of free speech it has enabled, while in-
creasing accountability and consumer 
transparency around content modera-
tion. 
Now, content moderation is certainly 
not all bad. For example, most of us 
are 
happy 
to 
have 
YouTube 
or 
Instagram suggest additional content 
that matches the music that we like to 
listen to or the hobbies that we are in-
terested in. The problem is that con-
tent moderation has been and largely 
continues to be a black box, with con-
sumers having little or no idea how the 
information they see has been shaped 
by the sites that they are visiting. 
The PACT Act would address this 
problem by increasing transparency 
around the content moderation proc-
ess. Sites would be required to provide 
an easily digestible disclosure of their 
content moderation practices for users, 
and, importantly, they would be re-
quired to explain their decisions to re-
move material to consumers. 
Until relatively recently, sites like 
Facebook and Twitter would remove a 
user’s post without explanation and 
without an appeals process. And even 
as platforms start to shape up their act 
with regard to transparency and due 
process, it is still hard for users to get 
good information about how content is 
moderated. 
Under the PACT Act, if a site chooses 
to remove your post, it has to tell you 
why it decided to remove your post and 
explain how your post violated the 
site’s terms of use. The PACT Act 
would also require sites to have an ap-
peals process. So if Facebook, for ex-
ample, removes one of your posts, it 
would not only have to tell you why, 
but it would have to provide a way for 
you to appeal that decision. 
We have seen increased concern late-
ly about news articles being removed 
from social media sites. Under the 
PACT Act, a newspaper whose article 
was posted on Facebook or Twitter and 
then removed by one of those platforms 
could challenge Facebook or Twitter, 
which would have to provide a reason 
for removing the article and allow the 
newspaper to appeal the decision. 
The PACT Act would also help us de-
velop the data necessary to dem-
onstrate whether social media plat-
forms are removing content in a biased 
or political fashion. As I said earlier, 
there has been increasing concern 
about biased content moderation on so-
cial media sites. The PACT Act re-
quires detailed transparency reports 
every 6 months from large social media 
platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, 
which will provide the data it needed 
to determine whether and where biased 
moderation exists. 
The PACT Act would also bolster ef-
forts by State governments to hold so-
cial media platforms accountable. The 
bill would allow State attorneys gen-
eral to bring civil lawsuits against so-
cial media platforms when these plat-
forms have violated Federal civil laws. 
The PACT Act would also require 
companies to remove material that has 
been adjudicated as illegal by a court. 
Internet platforms would be required 
to remove illegal content within 4 
days. Failure to remove illegal mate-
rial would result in the platform’s los-
ing its 230 protections for that content 
or activity, a provision that matches a 
recommendation made by the Trump 
Department of Justice for section 230 
reform. 
I am grateful to Senator SCHATZ for 
partnering with me on this legislation. 
Our bill is a serious, bipartisan ap-
proach to the issue of section 230 re-
form, and it would go a long way to-
ward making social media platforms 
more accountable to consumers and in-
creasing transparency around the con-
tent moderation process. 
I invite our colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to join us in advancing this 
legislation. 
By Ms. COLLINS: 
S. 804. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the 
limitation on the amount individuals 
filing jointly can deduct for certain 
State and local taxes; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is 
the time of year when people are calcu-
lating their taxes and filing their re-
turns. There are inequities in our Tax 
Code, and the bill I am introducing 
today, the SALT Deduction Fairness 
Act, would help remedy one of these in-
equities. This bill would ensure that 
limits on State and local tax deduc-
tions, also known as SALT deductions, 
do not disproportionately and unfairly 
penalize married couples. 
Currently, the amount in State and 
local taxes that both single and mar-
ried filers may deduct from their an-
nual income taxes is capped at $10,000. 
Single filers and married filers are 
treated the same, and married people 
who file their taxes separately are lim-
ited to $5,000 each. In other words, peo-
ple would be better off not getting mar-
ried when it comes to the SALT deduc-
tion. My bill removes this penalty by 
simply 
doubling 
the 
deduction 
to 
$20,000 for married filers. 
This is the situation we have now: 
Two single people can both claim 
$10,000 worth of State and local income 
taxes as a deduction on their Federal 
returns, but if they get married, they 
can claim only $10,000 together. This is 
a classic example of a marriage tax 
penalty. 
When the Senate considered the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, I worked to 
keep the SALT deduction in the Fed-
eral Tax Code because of the increased 
tax burden its elimination would have 
imposed on many Mainers who pay 
property taxes on their seasonal cot-
tages as well as their homes, who remit 
annual excise taxes on their vehicles, 
and who are subject to State income 
taxes. 
The SALT deduction has been in the 
Tax Code since 1913, when the Federal 
income tax was first established. It is 
intended to protect families from dou-
ble taxation, from essentially paying a 
tax on a tax. 
The Senate adopted my amendment, 
which paralleled that of the House, to 
retain the deduction for State and 
local taxes up to $10,000. This deduction 
is especially important to families liv-
ing in high-tax States, like Maine, 
which has one of our Nation’s highest 
State taxes and where many residents 
own second homes, like camps on 
Maine’s beautiful lakes. Last year, an 
analysis by WalletHub found 
that 
Maine had the fourth highest overall 
tax burden behind only New York, Ha-
waii, and Vermont. Yet Maine’s median 
household income ranked only 35th in 
the Nation and was approximately 
$6,800 below the U.S. median household 
income. So maintaining this deduction 
provides important tax relief for those 
Mainers who continue to itemize their 
deductions. Yet we can do better. We 
can make the SALT deduction fairer 
by eliminating the marriage penalty 
that limits a married couple to just 
$10,000; whereas, if they were not mar-
ried, they could each claim $10,000. 
According to the U.S. Census, there 
are more than 60 million married cou-
ples living in our Nation. Our Tax Code 
should be fair to them. We should not 
create a situation in which married 
couples would have been better off fi-
nancially, in terms of taxes, had they 
not married. One way to accomplish 
this goal is to double their access to 
deductions for the State and local 
taxes they pay, including from prop-
erties they share, such as their homes. 
This legislation would remedy this 
double taxation problem and eliminate 
the marriage tax penalty when it 
comes to the SALT tax deduction. 
It boils down to this: We simply 
should 
not 
be 
unfairly 
penalizing 
American taxpayers for being married. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense bill to fix this marriage 
tax penalty.

By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
COLLINS, 
Mr. 
WARNER, 
Mr. 
CRAMER, Ms. CORTEZ
MASTO, 
and Mr. WYDEN): 
S. 808. A bill to amend the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 to promote trans-
parency in the oversight of cybersecu-
rity risks at publicly traded compa-
nies; to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
reintroducing the Cybersecurity Dis-
closure Act along with three members 
of the Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, Chairman WARNER and Sen-
ators COLLINS and WYDEN, in addition 
to 
Senators 
CORTEZ
MASTO
and 
CRAMER, who serve with me on the Sen-
ate Banking Committee. In response to 
serious data breaches of various com-
panies, our legislation asks each pub-
licly traded company to include—in Se-
curities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission 
(SEC) disclosures to investors—infor-
mation on whether any member of the 
Board of Directors is a cybersecurity 
expert, and if not, why having this ex-
pertise on the Board of Directors is not 
necessary because of other cybersecu-
rity steps taken by the publicly traded 
company. To be clear, the legislation 
does not require companies to take any 
actions other than to provide this dis-
closure to its investors. 
As EY, also known as Ernst & Young, 
noted in an August 2020 publication, 
‘‘Public disclosures can help build trust 
by providing transparency and assur-
ance around how boards are fulfilling 
their cybersecurity risk oversight re-
sponsibilities.’’ 
Investors 
and 
cus-
tomers deserve a clear understanding 
of whether publicly traded companies 
are prioritizing cybersecurity and have 
the capacity to protect investors and 
customers from cyber related attacks. 
Our legislation aims to provide a better 
understanding of these issues through 
improved SEC disclosures. 
While this legislation is a matter for 
consideration by the Banking Com-
mittee, of which I am a member, this 
bill is also informed by my service on 
the Armed Services Committee and the 
Select 
Committee 
on 
Intelligence. 
Through this Banking-Armed Services- 
Intelligence perspective, I see that our 
economic security is indeed a matter of 
our national security, and this is par-
ticularly the case as the pandemic has 
forced many of us to be ever more de-
pendent on technology and the Inter-
net. 
Indeed, General Darren W. McDew, 
the former Commander of U.S. Trans-
portation Command, which is charged 
with moving our military assets to 
meet our national security objectives 
in partnership with the private sector, 
offered several sobering assessments 
during an April 10, 2018 hearing before 
the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
He stated that ‘‘cyber is the number 
one threat to U.S. Transportation 
Command, but I believe it is the num-
ber one threat to the Nation . . . in our 
headquarters, 
cyber 
is 
the 
com-
mander’s business, but not everywhere 
across our Country is cyber a CEO’s 
business . . . in our cyber roundtables, 
which is one of the things we are doing 
to raise our level of awareness, some of 
the CEO’s chief security officers cannot 
even get to see the board, they cannot 
even . . . see the CEO. So that is a 
problem.’’ 
With growing cyber threats that have 
resulted in serious breaches, we all 
need to be more proactive in ensuring 
our Nation’s cybersecurity. This legis-
lation seeks to take one step towards 
that goal by encouraging publicly trad-
ed companies to be more transparent 
to their investors and customers on 
whether and how their Boards of Direc-
tors 
and 
senior 
management 
are 
prioritizing cybersecurity. 
I thank the bill’s supporters, includ-
ing the North American Securities Ad-
ministrators Association, the Council 
of Institutional Investors, the National 
Association of State Treasurers, the 
California Public Employees’ Retire-
ment System, the Bipartisan Policy 
Center, MIT Professor Simon Johnson, 
Columbia Law Professor Jack Coffee, 
the Consumer Federation of America, 
and Rhode Island General Treasurer 
Seth Magaziner, and I urge our col-
leagues to join in supporting this legis-
lation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1618 
March 17, 2021 
Whereas the United States will host the 
Ninth Summit of the Americas for the first 
time since it hosted the inaugural Summit 
in Miami, Florida in 1994; 
Whereas, since 1994, the Summit of the 
Americas is a valuable forum for democrat-
ically elected heads of state and govern-
ments of the Western Hemisphere to discuss 
common policy issues, affirm shared values, 
and commit to concerted actions at the na-
tional and regional level to address the novel 
and existing challenges facing the Americas; 
Whereas the First and Second Summits of 
the Americas advanced commitments to 
lower trade barriers, improve transparency 
and market access, and facilitate economic 
integration, and, following those Summits, 
the United States has signed free trade 
agreements with 12 of the 35 countries in the 
region; 
Whereas, since 2018, Argentina, Bolivia, 
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Ja-
maica, Panama, Suriname, and Uruguay 
have signed Memorandums of Understanding 
with the United States under the America 
Crece Program to leverage private invest-
ment in energy and infrastructure projects 
and advance economic prosperity, security, 
and good governance; 
Whereas, during the 2018 Summit of the 
Americas, the United States announced addi-
tional humanitarian assistance for Ven-
ezuelans who have fled their country as a re-
sult of the political, economic, and security 
crises created by the regime of Nicola´s 
Maduro, including support for the United Na-
tions 
High 
Commissioner 
for 
Refugees 
(UNHCR) response to assist Venezuelan refu-
gees in Colombia and Brazil; 
Whereas Transnational Criminal Organiza-
tions (TCOs) and their involvement in money 
laundering and the trafficking of people, nar-
cotics, and weapons in the region pose com-
plex transnational threats to United States 
public health and national security, as well 
as the stability of the Americas, by under-
mining citizen security, basic human rights, 
the rule of law, good governance, and eco-
nomic development; 
Whereas the United States has sought to 
improve regional security through friendly 
and sustained relationships that build inter-
operability, readiness, and capability with 
regional 
security 
partners, 
including 
through programs such as Plan Colombia, 
the Merida Initiative, the Central America 
Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), and 
the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI); 
Whereas 
the 
pandemic 
caused 
by 
coronavirus disease 2019 (commonly referred 
to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) has had devastating 
health and socioeconomic consequences for 
the states and peoples of the Americas that 
have— 
(1) overwhelmed health systems; 
(2) led to the worsening of economic condi-
tions and contraction of gross domestic prod-
uct per capita; 
(3) led to an increase in unemployment, es-
pecially for individuals working in small- 
and medium-size businesses and large infor-
mal sectors across the region, and a rise in 
the number of people living in poverty; and 
(4) created conditions that have strength-
ened the illicit activities of criminal organi-
zations; 
Whereas the United States Government re-
mains deeply concerned about the negative, 
often predatory effects of China’s growing 
political, economic, military, and techno-
logical influence throughout the region, in-
cluding significant illegal, unreported, and 
unregulated fishing activities in the South-
ern Atlantic Ocean and Eastern Pacific 
Ocean and opaque infrastructure invest-
ments that impose unsustainable financial 
burdens on recipient countries, enable cor-
ruption, and undermine good governance; 
Whereas the United States Government is 
deeply concerned about the Government of 
the Russian Federation’s employment of a 
wide array of diplomatic, military, intel-
ligence, cyber, misinformation, and commer-
cial tools to undermine democratic systems 
in the region, including through its deep-
ening political, economic, and security sup-
port for the Maduro regime in Venezuela; 
Whereas the United States Government is 
deeply concerned about efforts by the Gov-
ernment of Iran to expand its political, eco-
nomic, and security presence in the region, 
including through its deepening ties with the 
Maduro regime in Venezuela; 
Whereas the regimes of Nicola´s Maduro in 
Venezuela, Miguel Dı´az-Canel in Cuba, and 
Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, have systemati-
cally eroded democratic institutions, com-
mit widespread human rights violations, 
draw lessons from one another to sharpen 
state-sponsored repression and internal con-
trol mechanisms, and receive the support of 
malign state and non-state actors, which 
pose a challenge to United States national 
security and national interests; 
Whereas entrenched corruption, linkages 
between transnational criminal organiza-
tions and political actors, and the harass-
ment and murder of journalists, human 
rights defenders, environmental activists, 
and civil society leaders in Latin America 
and the Caribbean weaken citizens’ con-
fidence in democracy and negatively affect 
United States national interests; and 
Whereas weak rule of law, elevated levels 
of criminal violence, and systemic corrup-
tion in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Hon-
duras fuel irregular migration that affects 
regional stability: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the occasion of the 
United States hosting the Ninth Summit of 
the Americas; 
(2) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to promote economic pros-
perity, security, and democratic governance 
throughout the Americas; and 
(3) calls on the President to lead a strong 
and coordinated diplomatic effort during the 
Summit process to ensure the Ninth Summit 
of the Americas— 
(A) strengthens democratic governance by 
building on the 2018 Lima Commitment to— 
(i) reduce bureaucracy; 
(ii) strengthen the independence of judi-
ciaries; 
(iii) increase transparency through the use 
of new technologies; 
(iv) encourage private sector participation 
in the formulation of public anti-corruption 
policies; 
(v) protect whistleblowers, journalists, and 
law enforcement officials; 
(vi) work towards preventing regional fi-
nancial systems from being used to transfer 
and conceal illicit funds; and 
(vii) identify resources to strengthen hemi-
spheric anticorruption mechanisms; 
(B) strengthens post-COVID–19 pandemic 
economic recovery efforts by outlining spe-
cific commitments to deepen trade and in-
vestment integration throughout the Amer-
icas and pursuing effective nearshoring and 
reshoring initiatives; 
(C) builds upon United States efforts to en-
hance the institutional capacity and tech-
nical capabilities of partner countries to 
strengthen the rule of law, civilian security, 
respect of human rights, and government 
transparency; 
(D) builds upon United States efforts to en-
hance regional cooperation to disrupt, de-
grade, and dismantle malign state and non- 
state influences, including transnational or-
ganized criminal networks, and terrorist or-
ganizations; 
(E) reinforces the capacity of member 
states to— 
(i) implement actions and initiatives in 
support of peaceful and democratic efforts of 
the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Ven-
ezuela, who desire to hold free and fair elec-
tions and restore democratic order and the 
rule of law in their respective countries; and 
(ii) support the people of El Salvador, Gua-
temala, and Honduras as they strive to ad-
dress weak democratic governance and the 
elevated levels of corruption, violence, and 
criminality that drive irregular migration; 
and 
(F) explores a comprehensive approach to 
forced displacement and migration chal-
lenges in the Western Hemisphere, takes 
stock of humanitarian crises and flashpoints 
in the region, and mobilizes member state 
commitments to advocate for and support 
multilateral humanitarian and development 
responses.

Whereas Mr. Crowe led his basketball team

his talents to a State-wide audience and be-
came the first player to ever earn the pres-
tigious distinction of Indiana Mr. Basket-
ball; 
Whereas Mr. Crowe earned an athletic 
scholarship to attend Indiana Central Col-
lege, known today as the University of Indi-
anapolis, where he played basketball, base-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1619 
March 17, 2021 
Whereas, in 1949, 2 years after Jackie Rob-
inson integrated Major League baseball, Mr. 
Crowe was picked up by the Minor League 
Hartford Chiefs, where he won the batting 
title with a .353 average; 
Whereas Mr. Crowe was called up by the 
Boston Braves in 1952 and played in the 
Major Leagues for 9 years on that team, the 
Cincinnati Redlegs, and the St. Louis Car-
dinals; 
Whereas, during his Major League baseball 
career, Mr. Crowe played primarily as a first 
baseman and a pinch hitter; 
Whereas, upon his retirement from Major 
League baseball, Mr. Crowe held the Major 
League record of 14 career pinch hit home 
runs and had a .990 fielding percentage; 
Whereas the most successful period of Mr. 
Crowe’s career in the Major Leagues was in 
1957, when he hit 31 home runs, and 1958,

from the Army, Mr. Crowe forced the inte-
gration of the movie theater in Franklin, In-
diana, when he refused to leave his seat on 
the main floor and move to the designated 
Negro section in the back of the theater; 
Whereas the prominence of Mr. Crowe in 
the Franklin, Indiana, community and his 
service in World War II, which was a war 
against fascism, led the movie theater to be 
permanently integrated 1 week after Mr. 
Crowe refused to leave his seat; and 
Whereas, after his retirement from profes-
sional sports, Mr. Crowe began new careers 
as an insurance salesman and then a school 
teacher in New York: Now, therefore, be it

(3) on March 22, 2021, which is the 100th an-
niversary of his birth, the Senate recognizes 
George Daniel Crowe as— 
(A) a great Hoosier; 
(B) a man of respect and achievement; and 
(C) a man whose example can help guide

HONORING 
EAGLE 
SCOUT 
ANGELINA HEMPHILL AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Angelina Hemphill, a newly 
minted Eagle Scout with Ankeny Troop 188, 
as our Iowan of the Week. Angelina is a mem-
ber of the inaugural class of female Eagle 
Scouts nationwide and one of the first-ever 
from Iowa. She hopes to inspire others to 
work hard and never settle for less than what 
they deserve. Her goal is to help people be-
lieve in themselves even when they’re faced 
with challenges and to help them look for the 
good in the world. 
To rise to the rank of Eagle Scout, Angelina 
has invested a lot of time and energy in edu-
cating herself and in giving back to her com-
munity. She completed 21 merit badges for 
tasks such as climbing, tying knots and fish-
ing. In all, Angelina completed nine more elec-
tives than she needed to earn the rank of 
Eagle Scout. Angelina also organized and led 
a conservation service project with a crew of 
volunteers who removed invasive species at 
Chichaqua Bottoms Greenbelt. Through her 
accomplishments, she has learned numerous 
first aid and outdoor skills and how to be a 
positive, contributing citizen. She has also 
learned valuable leadership skills that she will 
carry with her for the rest of her life. 
As one of the first women elected to the 
U.S. House of Representatives from the state 
of Iowa, I can attest that being the first at 
something is never easy. Angelina’s bravery 
and determination, and her belief that young 
women should have an equal chance to learn 
about leadership and valuable life skills makes 
me so excited to see what the next generation 
can achieve. 1 am proud to represent constitu-
ents like Angelina who aren’t afraid to stand 
up for themselves and take a chance at doing 
something new. During this first week of Wom-
en’s History Month, I couldn’t be happier to 
name trailblazing Angelina as Iowan of the 
Week.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
SERVICE 
PAWS 
OF 
CENTRAL 
PENNSYL-
VANIA 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize Service Paws of Central 
Pennsylvania for its service to the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. 
The volunteers at Service Paws of Central 
Pennsylvania have stepped up to alleviate 
burdens for individuals and families in the 
process of purchasing a service dog. Service 
Paws helps to offset this expense, which can 
range from between $4,000 to $35,000. 
Service Paws of Central Pennsylvania, 
which is operated entirely by volunteers, now 
serves Pennsylvanians in 14 counties. 
The Service Paws of Central Pennsylvania 
volunteers are incredible community leaders in 
Blair County and across our Commonwealth. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I thank them for their work to 
improve the lives of Pennsylvanians and wish 
them continued success in this mission.

THOSE 
WHO 
PROTECTED 
THE 
U.S. CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong. support of H.R. 1085, legislation 
awarding three congressional gold medals to 
the United States Capitol Police and those 
who on January 6, 2021 displayed selfless 
and heroic service in defense of American de-
mocracy in protecting the U.S. Capitol from 
the violent assault of domestic terrorists. 
The United States Capitol Police dates back 
to 1800 when the Congress moved from Phila-
delphia to Washington, D.C. and a lone watch-
man was hired to protect the Capitol Building. 
In 1827, President John Quincy Adams 
asked that a regular Capitol Police force be 
established and on May 2, 1828, Congress 
passed an Act that expanded the police regu-
lations of the City of Washington to include the 
Capitol and Capitol Square. 
The United States Capitol Police expanded 
its force after the terrorist attacks on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and again following the his-
toric merger with the Library of Congress Po-
lice in 2009. 
In addition to the more than 2,000 sworn 
members of the force, the United States Cap-
itol Police Department has over 350 civilian 
personnel who provide operational and admin-
istrative support and its diverse workforce is 
comprised of employees from nearly all 50 
states and the U.S. territories. 
The United States Capitol Police embodies 
the best in American policing and serves as a 
model in security, urban crime prevention, dig-
nitary protection, specialty response capabili-
ties, and homeland security. 
As ambassadors of the Congress, officers of 
the United States Capitol Police Department 
are often the first face that visitors and em-
ployees encounter, leaving a lasting impres-
sion that is reflective of the Legislative Branch 
and its role in America’s democracy. 
Officers of the United States Capitol Police 
Department each day proudly protect the leg-
islative process, the symbol of the nation’s de-
mocracy, the people who carry out the proc-
ess, and the millions of visitors who travel 
here to see democracy in action. 
No finer example of the selfless devotion to 
duty, love of country, and fidelity to their oath 
to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitu-
tion of the officers of the United States Capitol 
Police Department’s than their valiant, heroic, 
and courageous response to the January 6, 
2021 assault on the Capitol Building by thou-
sands of domestic terrorists, insurrectionists, 
and rioters sent there by the President of the 
United States to ‘‘fight like hell’’ to disrupt and 
derail the constitutionally required Joint Meet-
ing of Congress to open, count, and publicly 
confirm the vote tally of the presidential elec-
tors and announce the persons who had been 
elected President and Vice-President of the 
United States. 
District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser 
and the Metropolitan Police Department have 
a distinguished record of protecting all groups, 
regardless of their beliefs, who come to the 
nation’s capital to exercise their First Amend-
ment rights peaceably to assemble, and to pe-
tition the Government for a redress of griev-
ances. 
At the direction of Mayor Bowser, and in ad-
vance of the scheduled demonstrations, mu-
tual aid was requested by the Metropolitan Po-
lice Department from several area police de-
partments to be on standby in the District, in-
cluding neighboring law enforcement depart-
ments, the Metropolitan Transit Police and 
non-law enforcement agencies such as the 
District’s Homeland Security and Emergency 
Management Agency and the Fire and Emer-
gency Medical Services Department. 
The sustained assault on the Capitol precip-
itated an equally unprecedented response, ne-
cessitating the urgent request of the United 
States Capitol Police for the Metropolitan Po-
lice Department to come defend the Capitol to 
which the Metropolitan Police Department re-
sponded immediately with several Civil Dis-
turbance Unit Platoons and proceeded to de-
ploy to the west front of the Capitol and ar-
rived within minutes. 
The violent mob overran protective meas-
ures at the Capitol and by 1:50 p.m., Metro-
politan Police Department had declared the 
assembly to be a riot and immediately began 
working to achieve the objectives of stopping 
domestic terrorists from entering the Capitol 
building and removing those that were already 
inside, secure a perimeter so that the Capitol 
could be cleared for lawmakers to resume the 
Joint Meeting of Congress to demonstrate to 
the nation and the world the robustness and 
vitality of America’s democracy, and making 
arrests of anyone violating the law. 
During the height of the siege of the Capitol, 
approximately 850 Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment members were at the Capitol, with an-
other 250 in the area to directly support the 
response and aftermath. 
Madam Speaker, people around the country 
and the world were shocked and moved by 
the video of a Metropolitan Police Department 
Officer being beaten by a crowd of insurgents, 
including one wielding an American flag, and 
of another in agony as he was crushed be-
tween a door and a riot shield but also awed 
by their bravery in the face of this unprovoked 
and vicious attack, bravery that was matched 
that day by countless other unheralded Metro-
politan Police Department officers. 
The January 6, 2021 siege of the Capitol 
assault resulted in one of the worst days of in-
juries for law enforcement in the United States 
since the September 11, 2001, terrorist at-
tacks. 
Madam Speaker, officers of the United 
States Capitol Police Department, the Metro-
politan Police Department of Washington, 
D.C., and other uniformed law enforcement of-
ficers stood their ground in defense of Amer-
ican democracy while being attacked by the 
angry mob of domestic terrorists with metal 
pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and other 
weapons. 
At least 138 officers, 73 from the United 
States Capitol Police Department and 65 from 
the Metropolitan Police Department in Wash-
ington, sustained injuries during the attack on 
the Capitol Building, several of which required 
hospitalization. 
The injuries sustained ranged from bruises 
and lacerations to more serious damage such 
as concussions, rib fractures, burns and even 
a mild heart attack. 
One United States Capitol Police Depart-
ment officer died from injuries sustained while 
physically engaging with protesters and two 
officers involved in the response have died by 
suicide. 
Dozens, if not hundreds, of officers whom 
law enforcement officials estimate will suffer in 
years to come with post-traumatic stress dis-
order and the dozens who contracted the 
coronavirus from the unmasked domestic ter-
rorists and rioters who stormed the Capitol. 
At least 38 Capitol Police officers have test-
ed 
positive 
or 
were 
exposed 
to 
the 
coronavirus as well as nearly 200 National 
Guard personnel who were deployed to pro-
tect the Capitol. 
Madam Speaker, the seven hours between 
the urgent call for help from the Capitol Police 
to Metropolitan Police Department and the re-
sumption of work by both houses of Congress 
will be indelibly etched in the memories of 
every law enforcement officer who was on the 
scene, as it is in the minds of the Senators, 
Representatives, congressional and support 
staff, and members of the media corps who 
were forced to seek safety behind locked 
doors. 
Despite 
being 
overwhelmed 
and

democracy, symbolized by the resolve of the 
officers of the United States Capitol Police De-
partment, prevailed and the seditious attack 
was quelled, the Capitol Building preserved, 
and the lives of United States Senators and 
Representatives protected, as well as those of 
congressional and support staff, and order 
was restored so that the Joint Meeting of Con-
gress was resumed and completed its con-
stitutionally required duty of counting and an-
nouncing the votes of the presidential electors, 
an essential step in the peaceful transfer of 
power that has been a hallmark of American 
democracy and the example to the world for 
more than two centuries. 
Madam Speaker, the gold coin authorized to 
be minted by this legislation and displayed at 
the United States Capitol Police headquarters, 
to the Metropolitan Police Department of 
Washington, D.C., and exhibited on display by 
the Smithsonian Institution conveys the thanks 
and appreciation of a grateful nation for the 
selfless and heroic service exhibited by these 
sentinels of the republic in defense of Amer-
ican democracy in responding to the January 
6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol by domes-
tic terrorists. 
This tribute is, as President Lincoln noted at 
Gettysburg, ‘‘altogether fitting and proper’’ for 
heroes of the republic. 
The action we are taking today should en-
courage all educational and media institutions 
throughout the United States to teach and cel-
ebrate the story of the heroism of the officers 
of the United States Capitol Police Depart-
ment, the Metropolitan Police Department, and 
all other law enforcement officers who, out of 
true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of 
the United States, selflessly risked their lives 
to protect the Capitol Building and its per-
sonnel, the Congress, and the spirit and fact 
of democracy in America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Americans to 
read, celebrate, and revere the Constitution of 
the United States, fidelity to which is the sur-
est best means of forming a more perfect 
union, establishing justice, ensuring domestic 
tranquility, providing for the common defense, 
promoting the general welfare, and securing 
the blessing of liberty to them and their pos-
terity.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
SUCCESS-
FUL FEDERAL CAREER OF BREN-
DA B. SMITH 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, as the Chair-
man of the Committee on Ways and Means, 
I rise today along with Ranking Member KEVIN 
BRADY, to commemorate the successful fed-
eral career of Brenda Smith, Executive Assist-
ant Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection’s (CBP) Office of Trade. Ms. 
Smith is retiring after 33 years of government 
service, including 27 years with CBP and the 
legacy U.S. Customs Service. 
Ms. Smith’s leadership at CBP is marked by 
significant advancements in the agency’s trade 
mission. She spearheaded unprecedented au-
tomation and modernization of the U.S. gov-
ernment’s import/export system, a renewed 
focus on preventing duty evasion, intellectual 
property rights infringement, and importation of 
goods derived from forced labor, as well as ef-
forts to adapt the agency’s trade and revenue 
workforce for the new pace and challenges of 
the 21st century trade environment. Ms. Smith 
also led the development of global e-com-
merce standards and focus on new tech-
nologies like blockchain and advanced ana-
lytics. 
Under Ms. Smith’s leadership, CBP modern-
ized the international trade process, com-
pleting development and deployment of the 
U.S. Single Window and the Automated Com-
mercial Environment (ACE)—the electronic 
portal for exporters and importers to clear 
shipments across the U.S. border. Ms. Smith 
took command of the Single Window project, 
organizing the efforts of 49 federal agencies 
and partnering with thousands of importers, 
exports, brokers, and technology developers 
to successfully deploy the modem, automated 
system. The Single Window is now a global 
model, and it has revolutionized the inter-
national trade process for U.S. businesses 
and consumers. In recognition of her leader-
ship on this project, Ms. Smith was a 2017 fi-
nalist in the Samuel J. Heyman Service to 
America award for management excellence. 
She also implemented key components of 
the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement 
Act (TFTEA) of 2015, the first comprehensive 
authorization of CBP since the agency’s cre-
ation in 2003. Ms. Smith led CBP’s implemen-
tation of the Enforce and Protect Act of 2015, 
increasing the transparency and effectiveness 
of CBP’s enforcement of antidumping/counter-
vailing duty orders, and, following the repeal of 
a critical loophole, CBP’s increased focus on 
enforcement of the import prohibition on goods 
produced using forced, prison, and forced 
child labor. 
Ms. Smith also led U.S. delegations to sev-
eral partner nations to strengthen relationships 
with customs and human rights officials, indus-
try leaders, and non-governmental organiza-
tions and bolster international safeguards 
against forced labor. For this work and for her 
focus on strengthening CBP’s trade enforce-
ment mission, Ms. Smith was honored with a 
2017 Distinguished Executive Presidential 
Rank Award, the highest award in civil service. 
In addition to leading a number of U.S. dele-
gations, Ms. Smith represented the United 
States on the World Customs Organization 
Council in 2007 and 2017. 
Ms. Smith also led CBP’s implementation of 
the landmark U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
(USMCA), working with the United States 
Trade Representative (USTR) and other fed-
eral agencies, as well as the U.S. international 
trade community, to ensure effective and time-
ly delivery of key customs provisions of the 
USMCA. 
Throughout her tenure at CBP and its pred-
ecessor, Ms. Smith always took the time to be 
responsive to Member questions and con-
cerns, making herself available for regular 
briefings. 
Prior to joining Customs, Ms. Smith worked 
at the Department of the Treasury. She also 
served on the staff of the Congressional Office 
of Technology Assessment and subsequently 
in the personal office of Congressman Bernard 
J. Dwyer of New Jersey. Over the course of 
her career, Ms. Smith received numerous ac-
colades, including a National Performance Re-
view ‘‘Hammer Award’’ and countless agency 
awards. 
We wish to congratulate Ms. Smith on her 
retirement and express our sincere apprecia-
tion for the many years of service, leadership, 
and accomplishment she has devoted to the 
U.S. government and the American people. 
We wish her the best of luck in her future en-
deavors.

REMEMBERING JOAN F. ARP 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Joan F. Arp, of Liberty Town-
ship, Ohio, who passed away on Saturday, 
March 13, 2021 at the age of 78. 
Joan was born on February 28, 1943 in 
Youngstown, Ohio, the daughter of Louis and 
Katherine (Popovich) Kunovich. Joan was a 
member of the First United Methodist Church 
in Girard and a member of the church’s care 
team, bereavement committee, and taught 
Sunday School when her children were young-
er. 
Mrs. Arp was a homemaker and stayed 
home to raise her children. She enjoyed play-
ing bingo, needlepoint and was so proud of 
her collection of Santa Clauses. Joan loved to 
participate in the many fun activities and out-
ings that were offered at Liberty Arms As-
sisted Living. 
Joan will miss all of her cherished friend-
ships, especially those she resided with. She 
leaves to cherish her memory, her children, 
Mark (Mary) Arp, of Hermitage, PA., and her 
daughter Kelly Hontula, of Liberty Township; 
sister Maureen Perrico, of Las Vegas, Nevada 
and grandson, Nicholas Arp. Besides her par-
ents, Joan is preceded in death by her hus-
band, Kenneth J. Arp, whom she married Oc-
tober 9, 1965 and died May 5, 2014, and her 
brother, James Kunovich. 
I am proud to be friends with Joan’s daugh-
ter, Kelly, and thank her for her long-standing 
support. My deepest condolences go out to 
Kelly, the entire family, and to all whose lives 
were touched by Joan.

Bay Area where Bob worked for Dow Chem-
ical in Pittsburg. He then went on to work for 
the East Bay Regional Parks District as a con-
struction inspector. 
In 1956, Bob and Eldora settled in Clayton 
where they advocated, along with other resi-
dents, for its incorporation. When the City of 
Clayton was incorporated in 1964, Bob be-
came the first mayor and served on the City 
Council until 1980. One of the City Council’s 
early accomplishments was the establishment 
of walking trails and preserved open space, 
which remain a highlight for the city today. 
Bob and Eldora also contributed to the cre-
ation of the Clayton Historical Society, which 
was chartered in 1976. Bob served as the 
President, helped raise money for city monu-
ments, and participated in the establishment of 
the Clayton Historical Society Museum. In 
1976, two historic homes were moved to Main 
Street and joined together to create the Mu-
seum, which stands today as a testament to 
Clayton’s dedicated citizens. Throughout his 
many years in Clayton, Bob continued to be 
an active member of the community. He 
served on The Grove Park Blue Ribbon Task 
Force and the Keller Ranch Master Plan com-
mittee and donated the flagpoles at City Hall, 
the Grove Park, and the Museum. 
Bob is a regular in downtown Clayton and is 
known for his laughter and insightfulness. 
Please join me in congratulating Bob on his 
100th birthday and his lifetime of service and 
leadership.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
MALCOLM HARDY DUDLEY 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the very well-lived life of Malcolm Hardy 
Dudley who died on February 10, 2021 at 
home in Atherton, California, with his wife of 
67 years, Cosette. He was born in Santa 
Cruz, California, to Allen Mason Dudley and 
Gladys Alda Hardy Dudley. 
Malcolm Dudley was a graduate of the Uni-
versity of California, Davis, and studied at the 
London School of Economics. He served his 
country in the U.S. Navy for three years on 
active duty and for another three years as a 
communications officer for the U.S. Naval 
Command Europe. He retired from the Naval 
Reserves as a captain in 1982. 
Malcolm Dudley’s life was full and varied 
and he has been described as affable, cheer-
ful, and relaxed, traits he combined with tre-
mendous energy and efficiency. He began his 
career as a financial advisor in 1962 and re-
tired in 2017, two weeks before his 85th birth-
day. He had a great interest in the environ-
ment and traffic congestion which led to his in-
terest in local government. He served on the 
Atherton City Council for 24 years, six of them 
as Mayor. He was a champion of public trans-
portation and he was known as the resident 
guru on regional transportation issues. 
Malcolm had a passion for boating and 
water-skiied on Lake Tahoe, often sailing his 
70-foot motor cruiser up the Pacific coast to 
Washington and Canada. He loved music and 
played jazz saxophone, and had a popular 
dance band in the 50’s, and played with the 
Unicorns swing band until this year. 
Malcolm leaves his wife Cosette and his 
daughters, Lynette Stebin and Virginia Rock, 
two grandchildren and countless friends, all of 
whom benefitted from his generosity and kind-
ness. I consider myself privileged to have 
been among his wide group of friends.

HONORING OUR PRISONER OF 
WAR/MISSING IN ACTION HEROES 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the sacrifices made by 
American men and women in uniform today 
and throughout our nation’s history. We should 
each take a moment to recognize the enor-
mous loss of Americans who leave their 
homes and families to serve their nation, and 
whose fates are unknown—some captured 
and listed as prisoners of war, while many oth-
ers are listed as missing in action. Their fami-
lies endure tremendous grief and pain, know-
ing that their loved one’s story may never be 
revealed and that they may never be laid to 
rest. 
Current 
estimates 
of 
American 
servicemembers who are unaccounted for 
number over 80,000. The vast majority of 
these are from conflicts decades ago, and an-
swers continue to elude us. We must continue 
our efforts to make sure that all American 
servicemembers listed as POW or MIA are re-
turned and that we continue to remember and 
venerate those who gave the ultimate sacrifice 
in war. 
I want to commend the efforts of Gene 
Spanos, a constituent of the 9th Congres-
sional District, who has spent a great deal of 
time and energy contributing to these efforts. 
His ongoing missions include, but are not lim-
ited to, pushing for recognition of American 
POWs who died in captivity during the Korean 
War, advocating for greater United Nations 
support of POW-MIA recognition efforts, en-
suring that potential MIA servicemember 
gravesites are included in the Master Exca-
vation listings country by country. The efforts 
of Mr. Spanos and so many dedicated individ-
uals around the country are ensuring that we 
continue to move forward on this critical issue. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the work of my 
constituent Gene Spanos and his counterparts 
who are dedicating their time and passion to 
these efforts.

VOCA FIX TO SUSTAIN THE CRIME 
VICTIMS FUND ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 16, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1652, or the ‘‘VOCA 
Fix Act of 2021,’’ a critical piece of legislation 
designed to curtail and prevent future cuts to 
an already diminished federal victim service 
grants program. 
This legislation must pass, because VOCA 
grants provide compensation to victims of 
crime at critical moments of desperate need. 
VOCA funds could help compensate the 
only surviving victim of Robert Lee Haskell 
who, driven by vengeance, fatally shot six 
members of his exwife’s family in Texas, in-
cluding four children. 
The survivor of Haskell’s rampage, a girl of 
only fifteen, was shot in the head and only 
survived by playing dead. 
VOCA funds could help compensate the 
wife and two children of a man killed in a 
home intrusion in Harris County, Texas, after 
an intruder entered the family’s home, ordered 
the wife and children to lock themselves into 
a room, and then proceeded to shoot their 
husband and father. 
VOCA funds could help compensate a 
woman who was abducted in Houston and 
forced to drive to an ATM at gunpoint, where 
she withdrew cash to give to her abductors. 
VOCA funds could help compensate innu-
merable victims and survivors of federal 
crimes, but only if we pass this legislation. 
VOCA grants have been vital in their sup-
port of traditional victim service providers 
across the nation, particularly for those organi-
zations serving victims of domestic violence, 
sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and 
drunk driving. 
VOCA grants also fund victim compensa-
tion, which helps survivors pay medical bills, 
missed wages, and in the most severe cases, 
funeral costs. 
However, the ‘‘federal grants used to sup-
port victim services through VOCA have de-
creased significantly over the past several 
years. 
Further drastic cuts to VOCA funding are 
expected, as the non-taxpayerfunded pool 
from which these grants originate, the Crime 
Victims Fund, is running dry. 
The Crime Victims Fund serves as an ex-
ample of true justice, because the money 
used to support victims comes not from tax-
payer dollars but rather from the criminal fines 
and penalties paid by federally convicted of-
fenders. 
The Crime Victims Fund has shrunk rapidly 
in recent years and continues to decline, be-
cause rather than prosecuting cases, the De-
partment of Justice increasingly settles cases 
through deferred prosecution and non-pros-
ecution agreements, and the monetary pen-
alties associated with these agreements are 
deposited into the Treasury rather than the 
Crime Victims Fund. 
These agreements deny funding to victim 
services, which is contrary to the spirit of 
VOCA: monetary penalties from crimes should 
go to serve victims of crimes. 
The crimes from which these penalties are 
derived are the same, whether they are pros-
ecuted or settled, and the funding should be 
going to serve victims. 
The VOCA Fix Act of 2021 fixes this by en-
suring that monetary penalties associated with 
deferred and non-prosecution agreements go 
into the Crime Victims Fund instead of into the 
Treasury. 
This simple fix will prevent future funding 
cuts that jeopardize programs’ abilities to 
serve their communities and will help address 
the many growing and unmet needs of victims 
and survivors, including survivors of domestic 
violence. 
This legislation not only recognizes that it is 
the victims of crime that bear the brunt of the 
drastic cuts being made, but also that we must 
protect those victims that have the courage to 
come forward and work together with the au-
thorities to bring justice to their offenders. 
Victims who cooperate with authorities often 
fear for their own safety and face pain at re-
visited trauma, and this legislation recognizes 
that rather than putting victims in further dan-
ger, we create for them a safe environment— 
both physically and emotionally. 
Victims may be intimidated by law enforce-
ment or other government agencies, but if we 
want victims to fully and freely cooperate with 
the authorities, we must ensure that victims 
feel protected and that there is no risk of be-
coming retraumatized. 
We must also make sure that if victims co-
operate with authorities, then measures to en-
sure the safety of victims will be provided in 
our government agencies working in tandem 
with victim service providers. 
Tomorrow, the House will vote on H.R. 
1620, which will reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994. 
We are doing so because we recognize the 
urgency and dire need faced by the victims 
and survivors throughout this country during a 
significant moment of ongoing domestic vio-
lence caused by this pandemic and experi-
enced by both women and men. 
Although local victim services agencies are 
there to help, they are facing record numbers 
of clients as well as the economic con-
sequences of the pandemic. 
Without the VOCA Fix Act of 2021, sur-
vivors of domestic violence and sexual assault 
will inevitably lose access to victim support 
services, leaving victims and survivors without 
options for safety and vulnerable to further vic-
timization. 
Madam Speaker, the time is now to deliver 
access to the services victims and survivors 
so desperately need during a critical moment 
when the need for victim assistance has sky-
rocketed and programs are being forced to cut 
lifesaving services for victims.
