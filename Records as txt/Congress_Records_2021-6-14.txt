House of Representatives 
The House met at 5 p.m. and was

f 
PRAYER 
Chaplain (Lieutenant Colonel) Bobby 
R. Patton, Jr., District of Columbia 
National Guard, Washington, D.C., of-
fered the following prayer: 
Most holy and merciful God, we come 
to You today in gratitude and celebra-
tion. 
Beginning with the Army, our Na-
tion’s military has stood for 246 years 
against all who sought to harm our de-
mocracy and citizens. Men and women 
from all backgrounds and all services 
demonstrated their dedication to our 
Nation by paying for our freedoms and 
safety with their tears, sweat, blood, 
and too often, lives. 
God, we pray and are grateful, par-
ticularly for our National Guard sol-
diers and airmen who protected us in 
our Nation’s Capital. We could not 
have done our work without their serv-
ice and the sacrifice of their families. 
Grant us wisdom to remember that 
we share a common home, and give us 
courage so that our words and actions 
will reflect what is truly best for that 
common home, our great Nation. 
Finally, we thank You for the ability 
and the capacity to serve the people of 
the United States. 
Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will take 
this occasion to update her announced 
policies of January 4, 2021, with respect 
to protocols in the Hall of the House 
related to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Consistent with updated guidance 
from the Attending Physician, the 
Chair wishes to inform Members that 
masks are no longer required in the 
Hall of the House for Members and 
staff who have been fully vaccinated. 
All Members and staff who have not 
been fully vaccinated are required to 
wear masks, and the Chair would note 
that all Members and staff may con-
tinue to wear masks at their discre-
tion. 
This announcement is incorporated 
within the policy on conduct during a 
covered period of January 4, 2021, and 
supersedes all other announced policies 
that are in conflict. The Sergeant at 
Arms is directed to enforce mask re-
quirements consistent with this an-
nouncement. 
The Chair would also inform Mem-
bers that, consistent with the Attend-
ing Physician’s updated guidance, the 
announced policies of January 4, 2021, 
and November 18, 2020, concerning 
group voting and Chamber capacity are 
no longer in effect. 
The Chair appreciates the attention 
of Members to this matter and expects 
Members to continue to respect the 
health and safety of other Members 
and staff during this ongoing pan-
demic, including by following the guid-
ance of the Attending Physician with 
respect to masks, social distancing, 
and other COVID-related health and 
safety protocols.

BRANCE OF 600,000 AMERICANS 
WHO PASSED AWAY FROM THE 
COVID–19 VIRUS 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members in the Chamber, as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, to rise for a moment of silence in 
remembrance of the 600,000 Americans 
who

passed 
away 
from 
the 
COVID–19 virus.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. LEE 
of California). The gentleman from 
Massachusetts is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
today, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 473, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 256, 
to repeal the Authorization for Use of 
Military Force against Iraq resolution 
of 2002, under a closed rule. The rule 
provides 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and one mo-
tion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1187, the Corporate Gov-
ernance 
Improvement 
and 
Investor 
Protection Act, under a structured 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Financial Services, 
makes in order 10 amendments, pro-
vides en bloc authority to the chair of 
the Committee on Financial Services, 
and provides for one motion to recom-
mit. 
The rule provides that the provisions 
of section 202 of the National Emer-
gencies Act shall not apply to H.J. Res. 
46. The rule also deems passage of H. 
Res. 467. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to 
en bloc requested roll call votes on sus-
pension bills considered on June 14 or 
June 15. This authority lasts through 
June 17. 
b 1715 
Madam Speaker, there are two criti-
cally important measures contained in 
this rule. 
H.R. 1187 will build on landmark re-
forms like the Dodd-Frank Act and 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It will help hold 
corporations accountable, help inves-
tors make informed decisions, and 
build a more sustainable and equitable 
economic recovery. These improve-
ments are badly needed, especially at a 
time when we are seeing a new era of 
sustainable investors. 
I want to discuss one bill in par-
ticular here today, Madam Speaker, a 
bill that was authored by the distin-
guished Chair, Congresswoman BAR-
BARA LEE from California, because this 
Congress is doing something extraor-
dinary. 
Nearly 20 years after we passed a 
measure to address the overthrow of 
Saddam Hussein and 10 years after the 
conflict in Iraq officially ended, we are 
reasserting our constitutional respon-
sibility over matters of war and peace 
by finally repealing the 2002 Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force. 
This isn’t an arcane legislative ma-
neuver or simply some rhetorical exer-
cise. This AUMF has been used over 
and over again to expand the mission 
and range of targets of U.S. military 
operations in Iraq never imagined when 
it was passed. 
In fact, President Trump misused it 
as recently as last January to justify 
the strike that killed Iranian General 
Qasem Soleimani. The impacts of that 
decision dramatically escalated ten-
sions between the United States and 
Iran and throughout the region, ten-
sions that persist to this very day. 
Madam Speaker, the process that we 
are starting here today with H.R. 256 
provides a roadmap for Congress to get 
off the sidelines and to stop abdicating 
its constitutional responsibility to de-
bate matters of war and peace. 
That is what our Founders intended. 
They knew that decisions of such mag-
nitude should not be made in a vacuum 
solely by a President. That is why the 
Constitution 
makes 
the 
President 
Commander in Chief but gives only 
Congress the power to declare war. 
It is no secret that for a long time 
there were Members on both sides of 
the aisle who preferred to skirt that re-
sponsibility. They left such consequen-
tial decisions to whoever sat at 1600

Pennsylvania Avenue, Republican or 
Democrat. 
But each of us was elected and sent 
here to do more than just make the 
easy calls. We were sent here to make 
tough decisions, especially when it in-
volves sending our uniformed men and 
women, the people we represent, into 
harm’s way and shoveling billions upon 
billions of taxpayer dollars overseas. 
A growing number of Members, both 
Democrats and Republicans, have been 
working together to reclaim our Arti-
cle I powers. There is now a bipartisan, 
bicameral consensus that we not only 
have to end endless wars, but we have 
to reexamine the shrinking congres-
sional authority and the expanding ex-
ecutive powers that get us into global 
conflicts in the first place and, like in-
ertia, keep us there for decades. 
The Rules Committee has been work-
ing with the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee to do just that because ev-
erything has changed since Congress 
enacted the original War Powers Reso-
lution over President Nixon’s veto 
more than 50 years ago. 
When we fight, how we fight, and why 
we fight, these are big issues that 
merit our most engaged attention and 
resolve. We have a responsibility to 
make sure that these laws and authori-
ties work in the modern age. 
I want to thank, in particular, Rank-
ing Member COLE on the Rules Com-
mittee for working with me in this ef-
fort. He has been pushing to reclaim 
Congress’ Article I responsibilities, no 
matter which party controls Congress 
or who sits in the White House. I know 
that sometimes it has been a lonely 
journey, but he has never stopped 
fighting because it is the right thing to 
do for this country and for this institu-
tion. 
I also want to thank Chairman 
MEEKS and Ranking Member MCCAUL 
for working with us on this bipartisan 
effort. 
Again, I want to thank Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE for being con-
sistent and never giving up in her ef-
fort not only to end endless wars but to 
make sure that Congress lives up to its 
constitutional responsibilities. 
I am grateful that we also have a 
President in office today who supports 
reevaluating executive war powers. I 
have to be honest, Madam Speaker, I 
never thought I would see that day. 
But President Biden spent decades in 
the Senate grappling with the limita-
tions of the War Powers Resolution, 
and he has a record of looking for ways 
to change it. 
This opportunity is like lightning in 
a bottle. We have a coalition in Con-
gress trying to get this done, and now 
the missing piece, a President in the 
Oval Office with the political will to 
take this on, is hopefully now falling 
into place. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join us in seizing this moment. Let’s 
make the repeal of the 2002 AUMF the 
first step in not only repealing and re-
forming outdated AUMFs but reimag-
ining the War Powers Resolution for 
the modern age. 
President Johnson once said that it 
is damn easy to get into a war, but it 
is awfully hard to get out of one. We 
are here today because of the truth of 
that statement. 
It should never be that Congress, and 
the people we represent, are sidelined 
on the life-or-death questions of when 
to go to war and when to come home. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank the distin-
guished gentleman from Massachu-
setts, the chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee, for yielding me the customary 
30 minutes, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today provides for consideration of two 
pieces of legislation. The first is H.R. 
256, which would repeal the 2002 Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force, 
or the AUMF. This AUMF authorizes 
the President to defend the Nation 
against threats posed by and in Iraq. 
Madam Speaker, as an Iraq war vet-
eran, I sat literally face-to-face with 
bombmakers, murderers, and other ter-
rorists who were willing to give up 
their lives in their quest to destroy 
America. The 2002 AUMF is the only 
current legal framework for fighting 
Iranian-backed militia operating in 
Iraq. 
I agree that there are important con-
versations to be had about the War 
Powers Resolution and the future of 
the 2002 AUMF. However, Congress 
should undertake a collaborative proc-
ess and work with stakeholders, like 
the Department of Defense and the in-
telligence community, and we should 
work with them to draft a replacement 
for the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs before we 
repeal important authorities for con-
fronting and eliminating terrorists. 
If we don’t do this, we leave our Na-
tion open to threats from Iran, which 
is already emboldened by President 
Biden’s kowtowing and his capitula-
tions, so we would be more vulnerable 
to Iran. 
We also leave ourselves vulnerable to 
other terrorist organizations that are 
intent on destroying and taking Amer-
ican lives both at home and abroad. 
This rule also makes in order H.R. 
1187, the so-called Corporate Govern-
ance Improvement and Investor Pro-
tection Act. In reality, this measure is 
nothing more than House Democrats’ 
latest attempt to force their radical, 
far-left agenda on the American people. 
Republicans support securities regu-
lation and disclosure regimes that are 
actually helpful to American investors 
and entrepreneurs. The bill before us 
today is meant to appeal to social ac-
tivists and woke corporations rather 
than Main Street investors looking to 
save money for retirement, pay for 
their kids’ college education, or simply 
build a better life. 
H.R. 1187 will push the SEC to focus 
on social activism rather than investor 
interests and use our securities laws to 
push a partisan progressive agenda. 
If you don’t believe me, just don’t 
take my word for it. Look at the words 
of Senator ELIZABETH WARREN. She put 
out a press release about provisions in 
this bill, which she claimed will ‘‘accel-
erate the market transition from fossil 
fuels to cleaner and more sustainable 
energy sources that mitigate climate 
change.’’ 
Those are her words. The activism is 
right there. It is written into this bill. 
Clearly, H.R. 1187 is about the social 
justice Democrats’ war on American 
coal, oil, and gas producers and the 
people who actually work in those in-
dustries. It is more about that than en-
hancing shareholder value. 
I would just like to remind my col-
leagues that under the law, public com-
panies are already required to publicly 
disclose any material information that 
investors would find important to mak-
ing investment decisions. If the manda-
tory disclosures in H.R. 1187 were actu-
ally material, public companies would 
already be required to disclose them. 
Rather, each of these disclosures, but 
particularly the climate and socially 
related disclosures, are intended to 
what I would call name and shame pub-
lic companies and bully them into 
compliance with the House Democrats’ 
radical, far-left progressive agenda. 
Madam Speaker, at the end of the 
day, H.R. 1187 discourages private com-
panies from going public; it encourages 
public companies to then go private; 
and it limits investment opportunities 
for hardworking Americans. 
While my colleagues across the aisle 
continue to bow before the woke mob 
and continue to appease woke yuppies, 
House Republicans will stand and fight 
for everyday Americans trying to save 
their hard-earned money and work to-
ward a better life for themselves and 
their families. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to op-
pose this rule. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I include in the RECORD a June 1 
Newsweek article titled ‘‘Congress Has 
a Chance To Reclaim Its War Powers.’’ 
[June 1, 2021] 
CONGRESS HAS A CHANCE TO RECLAIM ITS 
WAR POWERS 
(By Dan Caldwell) 
In response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, 
then-President George W. Bush signed into 
law the 2001 Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force to provide the legal authority to 
pursue and punish those responsible. The fol-
lowing year, the 2002 AUMF was passed to 
authorize the ill-conceived invasion of Iraq 
and the overthrow of dictator Saddam Hus-
sein. 
Over the last 20 years, both laws have been 
used to justify military actions disconnected 
from their original intent. These laws—un-
modified since their original passage—have 
sanctioned combat operations in at least 19 
countries. 
Successive congresses have abdicated their 
constitutionally prescribed role in foreign

policy, allowing four presidential adminis-
trations to exploit the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs 
and stretch their Article II authorities. Mul-
tiple military conflicts have been expanded 
or initiated with minimal congressional 
oversight and debate. 
It is past time for Congress to firmly re-
assert its role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. 
After 20 years of endless war, it owes its con-
stituents—including our men and women in 
uniform—a 
better 
foreign 
policy 
that 
prioritizes keeping Americans safe. Rather 
than abdicating its solemn duties, Congress 
must inquire, ‘‘Why, at what cost, and to-
ward 
what 
end?’’ 
are 
young 
American 
servicemembers sent to fight and die for ill- 
premised objectives that are fundamentally 
disconnected from vital national interests. 
Further evasion of these hard questions 
cheapens the ‘‘true faith and allegiance’’ 
they swore to uphold when elected to office. 
Over 7,000 Americans have lost their lives 
and tens of thousands more wounded in Af-
ghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Africa. 
These conflicts have cost the American tax-
payer over $6.4 trillion dollars—a number 
that will surely continue to grow as wars 
drag on and the cost of caring for veterans of 
these wars is tallied. 
Congress has several ways it can help bring 
an end to our endless wars while helping 
shape a better foreign policy. 
First, in the coming months the House of 
Representatives will likely have an oppor-
tunity to repeal the 2002 AUMF by passing 
legislation introduced by Representative 
Barbara Lee (D–Calif.)—a stalwart champion 
of Congress reclaiming its powers in matters 
of war and peace. A similar bill has been in-
troduced in the Senate by Senators Todd 
Young (R–Ind.) and Tim Kaine (D–Va.), 
which has been endorsed by the Biden admin-
istration. Additional legislation repealing 
the outdated 1957 and 1991 AUMFs has been 
introduced by Representatives Peter Meijer 
(R–Mich.) and Abigail Spanberger (D–Va.). 
Passage of these bipartisan bills should be a 
no-brainer for a Congress bitterly divided on 
other issues and an important first step to-
ward Congress reclaiming its most impor-
tant prerogative. 
Congress should also consider revision—or 
outright repeal—of the 2001 AUMF. More 
than the 2002 AUMF, this law has been 
stretched to justify conflicts far afield from 
its original intent of authorizing operations 
against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghan-
istan after 9/11. It is worth acknowledging 
that the underlying purpose of the 2001 
AUMF has been satisfied: Osama bin Laden 
is dead, Al-Qaeda has been decimated and the 
Taliban severely punished. And despite never 
being amended, this authorization has been 
cited to account for operations against 
groups that didn’t even exist on 9/11 in places 
such as Somalia and Libya. 
If Congress repeals the 2001 AUMF, the ex-
ecutive branch still has the authority to au-
thorize military operations to repel immi-
nent attacks and to engage in self-defense 
(although Congress should take steps to en-
sure that this authority isn’t stretched too 
far, as it was by President Joe Biden’s recent 
airstrikes in Syria). If Congress identifies a 
need to replace the 2001 AUMF, it should au-
thorize force against clear targets given 
specified objectives, geographic boundaries 
and clear sunsets. 
Congress should also use its power of the 
purse to assert its authority in foreign pol-
icy. This is in many ways the most effective 
tool Congress has and it has been used suc-
cessfully in the past to end American in-
volvement in conflicts, including Vietnam. 
Repealing outdated AUMFs and helping 
end our forever wars around the globe would 
enjoy broad support from the American peo-
ple. Poll after poll has shown a majority of 
Americans want an end to our wars in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq, while also supporting 
Congress playing a greater role in author-
izing military conflicts abroad. 
I am proud to have deployed to Iraq as a 
U.S. Marine. Many of those I served with are 
still in uniform and are still deploying to 
war zones on a regular basis, even if they 
harbor doubts about the necessity of those 
conflicts. Congress owes it to them to step 
up and do its job by reasserting itself in mat-
ters of war and peace. Failing to do so dis-
honors those who have and who continue to 
serve overseas in the wars that have dragged 
on in part due to congressional inaction. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
over the last 20 years, both the 2001 and 
2002 AUMFs have been used to justify 
military actions disconnected from 
their original intent. 
I want to say to my colleague from 
Pennsylvania that we are grateful for 
his service to our country. But the fact 
is that we are still operating under an 
AUMF that we passed almost 20 years 
ago, almost two decades ago. 
When we were debating that AUMF— 
an AUMF that I voted against—there is 
no way that we would have anticipated 
what the realities are now. The notion 
that somehow we can’t, as a body, 
come 
together 
and 
revisit 
these 
AUMFs on a regular basis, to me, is be-
yond comprehension. 
We owe it to the men and women who 
serve our country in our Armed Forces 
to make sure that we are doing our due 
diligence. 
The President has multiple authori-
ties, by the way, to be able to respond 
to any threats against individual U.S. 
citizens almost anywhere in the world. 
But if people are trying to use this 
AUMF as a way to potentially have a 
war with Iran, let me just say this: If 
that is what anybody’s goal is, you bet-
ter damn well come back to Congress 
and have a debate, and people ought to 
be able to vote yes or no on it. 
Many of us are concerned that these 
lingering AUMFs are going to be mis-
construed and misinterpreted and mis-
used. 
I include in the RECORD a Statement 
of Administration Policy. President 
Biden supports the Lee bill. He doesn’t 
see any need to have a continuation of 
the 2002 AUMF. If the President of the 
United States doesn’t see a need to 
continue it, I don’t know why we feel 
we have to continue something that is 
clearly outdated. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 256—REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE 
OF MILITARY FORCE—AGAINST IRAQ RESOLU-
TION
OF
2002—REP. LEE, D–CA
WITH
134
CO- 
SPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage of H.R. 256, to repeal the Authorization 
for Use of of Military Force Against Iraq 
Resolution of 2002 (‘‘2002 AUMF’’). This bi-
partisan legislation would terminate the Oc-
tober 16, 2002, statutory authorization for the 
use of military force against Iraq. 
The Administration supports the repeal of 
the 2002 AUMF, as the United States has no 
ongoing military activities that rely solely 
on the 2002 AUMF as a domestic legal basis, 
and repeal of the 2002 AUMF would likely 
have minimal impact on current military op-
erations. Furthermore, the President is com-
mitted to working with the Congress to en-
sure that outdated authorizations for the use 
of military force are replaced with a narrow 
and specific framework appropriate to en-
sure that we can continue to protect Ameri-
cans from terrorist threats. 
In working with the Congress on repealing 
and replacing other existing authorizations 
of military force, the Administration seeks 
to ensure that the Congress has a clear and 
thorough understanding of the effect of any 
such action and of the threats facing U.S. 
forces, personnel, and interests around the 
world. As the Administration works with the 
Congress to reform AUMFs, it will be critical 
to maintain the clear authority to address 
threats to the United States’ national inter-
ests with appropriately decisive and effective 
military action. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. I thank Congress-
woman LEE, our Speaker pro tempore, 
for her longtime advocacy on this very 
important issue. Her leadership on the 
fundamental question of the role of 
Congress in matters of war has been 
unwavering, and we owe her a debt of 
gratitude for her commitment to bring-
ing this issue to the forefront. 
Nearly two decades ago, Congress 
passed a resolution authorizing mili-
tary force against the Iraqi regime of 
Saddam Hussein. That resolution was 
aided in its passage by deeply flawed 
intelligence that we now know had no 
basis in fact. 
It has been 18 years since Saddam 
Hussein was deposed. It has been a dec-
ade since the United States declared a 
formal end to operations in Iraq. The 
Iraqi Government is a regional partner, 
and the U.N. Security Council resolu-
tions referenced have been fulfilled. 
There is no reason to allow the 2002 
AUMF to stand. It does not enhance 
our national security. It does not make 
Americans any safer. It does not make 
the mission of our men and women in 
uniform any easier. 
We must act so that Congress again 
asserts its responsibility in authorizing 
war. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt the 
rule and H.R. 256. 
Again, I thank Congresswoman LEE 
for her extraordinary leadership.

Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, in addition to making H.R. 
256 and H.R. 1187 in order, the rule be-
fore us today includes a budget-deem-
ing resolution that puts the House on 
track for a $1.5 trillion spending spree. 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), my good 
friend and ranking member of the 
Budget Committee, to discuss this 
reckless spending spree. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, this is complete madness that 
the Democrats are trying to push 
through a deeming resolution to spend 
$1.5 trillion, and they have yet to even 
bring it up in the debate. 
They want the American people to 
believe that what we are about to vote 
on on this floor right now is a bill that

June 14, 2021 
is in Financial Services or a bill that is 
in Foreign Affairs. But yet they are 
trying to pass a resolution to bypass 
the budget process to spend $1.5 tril-
lion. 
The Democrats have been in power 
for almost 900 days, and they have yet 
to put a real budget on the floor of the 
House of Representatives, even though 
the Budget Control Act of 1974 clearly 
states the process. 
What is it? What are you trying to 
hide? Why don’t you want debate over 
$1.5 trillion of spending? Why are you 
hiding it from the American people? 
Why are you being so dishonest? 
$1.5 trillion is a lot of money. Your 
President submitted a budget just 2 
weeks ago, the latest budget in the his-
tory of the United States. Are you not 
wanting to debate it? Are you not 
wanting to discuss it? Because the 
Speaker said the budget is a statement 
of your values. Show us your values. 
You don’t want the American people 
to see your values because in the Presi-
dent’s budget, the largest amount of 
spending in the history of this country, 
$69 trillion, you are putting $80 billion 
to hire 87,000 IRS auditors to go after 
the American people. The largest tax 
increases in the history of the United 
States. $55 trillion. Tax increases on 
low income, middle income, all in-
comes. It is the big lie. 
But you know what? Across-the- 
board average increases on everything 
by at least a 16-percent increase except 
for things that deal with security: Our 
men and women in uniform, flatlining 
our national defense. Not one addi-
tional dollar could be found for border 
security when we are facing the Biden 
border crisis right now. 
More people have illegally crossed 
the southern border since January 20 
than the entire population of Kansas 
City, Missouri, and you all can’t find 
one additional dollar? It is because you 
are divided within your party. You all 
are fighting to defund the police. You 
are fighting to defund our men and 
women in the Army, the National 
Guard, the Navy, the Air Force. Where 
are your priorities? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HOULAHAN). Members are reminded to 
address their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, where are your party’s prior-
ities in defunding the police, defunding 
our military? Put this legislation on 
the floor. Don’t try to put it in one sen-
tence, one sentence in a rule. 
We are 31⁄2 months from a govern-
ment shutdown, 31⁄2 months. Let’s pass 
a budget, a budget that was supposed 
to be passed by April 15, according to 
the law. April 15. Let’s prevent this 
government shutdown. 
But yet, Madam Speaker, your side is 
trying to hide $1.5 trillion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman such 
time as he may consume. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I will just plead to the House 
Democrats, I will plead to you, Madam 
Speaker, please be transparent with 
the American people. We don’t want a 
government shutdown. 
But the fact that you won’t even 
bring forth a budget to be debated, 
your President’s budget, you will not 
bring it to the House floor because you 
don’t want the American people to see 
exactly how you are trying to destroy 
the working class, to raise taxes on the 
low-income and the working class, to 
put 87,000 tax auditors to go after the 
working class. 
The people see it. They see right 
through it. And history will definitely, 
definitely not read well for the House 
Democrats. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, what a crock. I 
mean, it is hard to hear anybody on the 
other side of the aisle talk about gov-
ernment shutdowns. I remember when 
they lost this place 3 years ago. What 
did they do? They left us with a gov-
ernment shutdown. First time ever in 
history, the Republican majority did 
that. 
The gentleman is saying we are not 
going to vote on this stuff. Maybe he 
doesn’t understand the legislative proc-
ess. Let me remind everybody that we 
have to vote on every single cent that 
we put forward here. 
We have an appropriations process. 
Maybe the gentleman doesn’t under-
stand that. But every cent that we 
spend has to be voted on by people in 
this Chamber. So nobody is not going 
to vote on anything. 
Let me just put this in perspective. 
Yes, the President’s budget was late, 
and given the timing of the President’s 
budget, the Appropriations Committee 
needs to get started to start doing 
their work, unless my friends don’t 
want the Appropriations Committee to 
do their work. Deeming a top-line num-
ber for appropriators is a housekeeping 
item that we can take care of so they 
can move forward, and we can then 
turn our attention to a budget resolu-
tion and enacting the transformational 
policies included in the President’s 
American Jobs Plan and American 
Families Plan. 
Here’s the thing that really gets me 
when I hear people have meltdowns on 
the floor. This process has been used by 
Republicans and Democrats alike in 
order to allow appropriators to get 
started on their work. Ever since the 
first deeming resolution in fiscal year 
1999, when Republicans were in charge, 
overall House Republican majorities 
used deemers nine times, including for 
fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 
2019. Boy, how convenient it is to for-
get about all of that. But, then, again, 
facts don’t seem to matter. 
Just one other thing. When the gen-
tleman used the term ‘‘big lie,’’ I don’t 
want to be lectured by anybody about a 
big lie, especially by individuals who 
voted deliberately to overturn the will 
of the American people, to undermine 
our democracy. I will not be lectured 
to by anybody on that matter. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a 
distinguished member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the rule 
we are considering and to speak to the 
necessity of Congress repealing the 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force against Iraq. 
Repealing the 2002 Authorization for 
Use of Military Force is a good first 
step towards Congress reasserting its 
constitutional authority over when and 
if the United States goes to war. This 
country has been in a state of per-
petual war for almost 20 years. We now 
have members of the Armed Forces de-
ployed overseas who are the children of 
soldiers who were sent to war under the 
2002 AUMF. 
Under Article I of the Constitution, 
Congress has the sole authority to de-
cide whether to allow the President to 
take the country into a prolonged war. 
Before this Nation sends our children, 
our servicemembers into harm’s way, 
Members of Congress have the duty to 
consider and approve or disapprove 
such use of force. Americans have the 
right to hold us accountable for those 
decisions. 
Repealing the 2002 AUMF does not 
impede the President’s ability to use 
military force without congressional 
approval in the event of a sudden 
threat or imminent attack, but we can-
not continue to operate under a system 
where U.S. Presidents can place Amer-
ican troops in harm’s way with no 
checks or balances. That is unaccept-
able. 
Congress’ failure to repeal or replace 
the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs for two dec-
ades has done lasting damage to the 
constitutional separation of powers be-
tween Congress and President. It is 
time for this practice to end. 
I urge all of my colleagues to approve 
this rule and vote to repeal the 2002 
AUMF. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, last month there 
were over 180,000 encounters at the 
southern border, almost 200,000 encoun-
ters at the southern border. That is a 
new 20-year record for illegal border 
crossings, 20-year record. 
Alarmingly, CBP has seized more 
deadly fentanyl so far in 2021 than in 
all of 2020. Based on our current trends, 
we can expect overdose deaths in 2021 
to meet, if not exceed, the 90,000 Amer-
icans who lost their lives between Sep-
tember 2019 and September 2020, 90,000 
American deaths. 
Yet Vice President HARRIS, who 
President Biden put in charge of stem-
ming migration at our southern border, 
refuses to go firsthand to see the crisis 
in person. In Vice President HARRIS’ 
own words, ‘‘If you want to fix a prob-
lem, you have to go where the problem 
exists.’’ That is what the Vice Presi-
dent said.

June 14, 2021 
Alarmingly, she hasn’t gone to the 
southern border at all. 
It would be laughable if this wasn’t a 
humanitarian crisis. It would be laugh-
able if Americans weren’t going to die 
of overdoses because of fentanyl cross-
ing our southern border. 
That is why, if we defeat the previous 
question, I will offer an amendment to 
the rule to immediately consider Con-
gresswoman ASHLEY HINSON’s See the 
Crisis Act. This legislation would re-
strict Vice President HARRIS
from 
using taxpayer dollars to travel inter-
nationally until she actually visits our 
southern border. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
any extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON) to 
explain the amendment. 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call for immediate consider-
ation of my See the Crisis Act. This 
legislation would prevent Vice Presi-
dent KAMALA HARRIS from using tax-
payer dollars to travel internationally 
before seeing the southern border crisis 
firsthand. 
Vice President HARRIS was named as 
the administration’s point person on 
the illegal immigration crisis at our 
southern border 80 days ago, and this 
crisis is worsening by the day. Yet the 
Vice President has refused to go to the 
border herself and talk to the brave 
law enforcement officers, the men and 
women who are fighting this on the 
front lines. 
This out-of-sight, out-of-mind ap-
proach is a disgrace, Madam Speaker, 
but let’s back up and look at how this 
crisis has developed on the Biden ad-
ministration’s watch. 
On day one of this administration, 
President Biden stopped construction 
of the border wall. Shortly after, he re-
instated catch-and-release. Now, this 
turned on the green light at our border. 
It incentivized the historic surge of il-
legal immigration that we are cur-
rently experiencing in this country. 
Open border policies are music to the 
ears of the cartels, the drug smugglers, 
and the traffickers who make their liv-
ing on human suffering. Make no mis-
take, business is good for cartels and 
drug smugglers under this administra-
tion right now. 
Snuck into this rule here tonight is a 
provision to set the spending levels for 
Congress, and these historic spending 
levels rise in nearly every category ex-
cept for one, the Department of Home-
land Security. This sends a pretty clear 
message to the cartels that the U.S. 
Government doesn’t think it is a pri-
ority to stop them. 
Madam Speaker, I recently visited 
the border to see the crisis for myself, 
hear what those on the front lines are 
facing every day. They told me they 
are completely overwhelmed. There are 
major vulnerabilities along our border. 
These are vulnerabilities that the car-
tels and the drug smugglers are ex-
ploiting every day. 
Border Patrol officers are appre-
hending sex offenders, gang members, 
even people on the terrorist watch list 
trying to come into our country ille-
gally, and these are just the people 
that they are catching. Deadly drugs 
are pouring across the border in droves. 
Fentanyl seizures at the border have 
increased by 233 percent this year. 233 
percent. 
When I was at the border I heard 
from both Democratic sheriffs and Re-
publican 
sheriffs 
about 
these 
dev-
astating realities and the damage that 
is being inflicted on our communities. 
But apparently, even as the adminis-
tration’s point person on the illegal 
immigration crisis, hearing from those 
on the ground is too much to ask for 
the Vice President. 
She has been the border czar for 80 
days. She has been to yarn shops, she 
has been to bakeries, and she just flew 
right over the crisis at our southern 
border to meet with foreign countries, 
with the taxpayers’ checkbook in hand. 
b 1745 
When asked why she hasn’t visited 
the southern border, she laughed. She 
laughed, and this is not a laughing 
matter. 
The border crisis impacts the safety 
and security of every Iowan, of every 
American. Every State is a border 
State right now. 
As Members of Congress, regardless 
of our party, it is our job to hold the 
administration accountable when it is 
failing the American people. 
Right now, Vice President HARRIS, 
Madam Speaker, is failing the Amer-
ican people. She is failing law enforce-
ment at the border. She is failing the 
families who will suffer because of the 
drugs coming across our border and 
falling into the wrong hands. 
Vice President HARRIS needs to see 
the crisis for herself and take action. 
That is exactly what my See the Crisis 
Act will force her to do. This bill will 
prevent the Vice President from trav-
eling internationally on the taxpayers’ 
dime until she visits the southern bor-
der and reports back to the American 
people on how the administration will 
secure our border. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to-
night to join me in defeating the pre-
vious question and holding this admin-
istration accountable for the border 
crisis. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I don’t even know what to say. The 
response to the situation at our border 
and to the people who are fleeing their 
countries in Central America to try to 
seek refugee in the United States, the 
response that the Republicans just 
came up with basically is saying we are 
going to withhold any money for Vice 
President HARRIS’ travel budget unless 
she goes to the border and does a photo 
op. 
We are supposed to be a serious legis-
lative body. We are supposed to be the 
most serious, most deliberative legisla-
tive body in the world, and my friends 
say we are going to withhold her travel 
budget unless she goes to the border 
and does a photo op. That is what this 
is. 
Never mind that Vice President HAR-
RIS represented California as a United 
States Senator, which is a border 
State. Never mind that she just went 
to Central America because people are 
coming to our border from places like 
El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. 
Never mind she went to some of these 
countries where people are fleeing so 
we can try to figure out how to deal 
with this issue. 
My Republican friends have brought 
to the House floor a bill that basically 
says: You know what? Our solution is 
you either go and do a photo op at the 
border or we are going to withhold 
your travel budget. 
I mean, really? That is a serious leg-
islative proposal? 
I don’t even know how to respond to 
that, other than to say that, you could 
have come up with something better. 
This isn’t even worth any more of my 
time talking about it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), my very 
good friend. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I note that the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts just re-
ferred to the possibility of the Vice 
President of the United States going to 
the border for a photo op. 
Well, if she can find the border on a 
map and actually use her taxpayer- 
funded airplane, go to Andrews Air 
Force Base, fly to the great State of 
Texas, fly directly to the border at the 
Rio Grande and actually find the time 
in her duty as the Vice President of the 
United States to give a whit about the 
people of Texas, then maybe she could 
actually have a photo op. 
Perhaps the people of this country 
and the State of Texas, which I rep-
resent, would like more than a photo 
op. Perhaps we would like a Vice Presi-
dent who actually cared about the peo-
ple of Texas, who actually cared about 
the ranchers. 
As I see my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle muttering under their 
breath right now, how dare I speak up 
about the people of Texas who want to 
be protected? How dare I stand up 
about the ranchers whose fences are 
being torn down?

Cartel Del Noreste of Los Zetas out of 
Nuevo Laredo; the two that were bound

pick grapes but was being sent to a

The 7-year-old girl who I talked to on 
the border at the Rio Grande at 1 
o’clock in the morning, when I don’t 
know where my colleagues were, but I 
can tell you that my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle were not with 
me. They were not down on the Rio 
Grande River. They were not talking to 
that 7-year-old girl who had a phone 
number written on her arm, or talking 
to any of the others who were being po-
tentially abused, as many NGOs and 
nonprofits estimate up to 25 to 30 per-
cent of the women on this journey are 
abused by dangerous cartels. 
It is not the Mexican Government 
that operates Tamaulipas or the state 
across the Rio Grande. It is the dan-
gerous cartels making tens of millions 
of dollars moving human beings for 
profit. 
That is what my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle sell as compas-
sion? 
Then I watch the Vice President of 
the United States go down to another 
country to say, well, what could we 
possibly do to stem the tide? 
How about actually secure the border 
of the United States? 
How about actually use Title 42 in 
the middle of a global pandemic to 
make sure that we control the flow at 
the border? 
How about actually have the infra-
structure in place that we know works? 
How about a return to Mexico policy 
where we can work with our friends in 
Mexico to stop the flow? 
How about not putting a big neon 
sign on the border saying: ‘‘Come on in. 
Don’t mind if the cartels abuse you on 
the way.’’ 
Meanwhile, Texas takes the brunt of 
it: an 800 percent increase over the last 
4 years total in fentanyl; 800 percent 
more this year alone. 
Do you know how dangerous fentanyl 
is, Madam Speaker? 
We have had 7,500 pounds of fentanyl. 
7,500 pounds that have been acquired by 
border 
patrol. 
Imagine 
what 
they 
might acquire if they weren’t limited 
in resources. Imagine what they might 
acquire if they weren’t undertaking 
processing in McAllen instead of hav-
ing wide open spaces between our ports 
of entry. 7,500 pounds, an 800 percent 
increase in Texas. My State is under 
siege. My State is taking it on the chin 
because Democrats refuse to secure the 
border of the United States. 
It is the fundamental duty of a na-
tion to secure its border. The funda-
mental duty. I come back here after 3 
weeks talking to ranchers and people 
in my State who are getting abused, 
losing 
their 
ranches, 
losing 
their 
homes, watching their kids die in 
overdoses, all while migrants get put in 
stash houses and get abused running up 
through my neighborhood and my com-
munities. 
Well, forgive me if I am not all that 
bothered by a resolution on this floor 
by my colleague from Iowa. And I 
think it is a good idea to try to call 
into question what the Vice President 
of the United States is actually spend-
ing her time doing. 
What on Earth is more important 
than securing the border of the United 
States? And how hard is it to get on 
your taxpayer-funded plane and fly to 
south Texas and go meet with the bor-
der patrol and meet with the ranchers 
and meet with the migrants and meet 
with the business owners who are get-
ting killed? 
It is happening every single day in 
our State. It is our duty in the people’s 
House to secure the border of this Na-
tion. And I have constituents and peo-
ple back home in Texas asking: What 
are we getting out of this deal? What 
are we getting out of our deal as being 
a part of the Union when the country 
won’t even secure the border of our 
State and our communities? They are 
asking me that question. 
We have a job to come together here 
on this floor in this body and do our job 
to secure the border of the United 
States. 
I commend the gentlewoman from 
Iowa for offering this resolution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The gentleman can come and huff 
and puff all he wants on the House 
floor, but, again, I remind people that 
the solution that is being put forward 
by my Republican friends is to with-
hold the Vice President’s travel budget 
until she does a photo op. I think this 
is beneath, quite frankly, the dignity 
of this legislative body. 
I would also say to the gentleman 
that what the Vice President was try-
ing to do was get at the source of mi-
gration, of people coming to our bor-
der, trying to solve the problem. She 
was spending her time trying to figure 
out how to solve the problem, not try 
to figure out how to overturn the last 
election; not trying to figure out how 
to reinstate the last President who lost 
the election not only fair and square, 
but by a pretty big margin, but actu-
ally trying to solve problems. 
It is hard to sit here and listen to 
some of the things we have listened to 
here today and then be told: Oh, here is 
our proposal. 
I mean, come on. Give me a break. 
Let’s get back to trying to figure out 
to solve problems rather than try to 
score political points. And if you are 
going to try to score political points, 
certainly you can come up with a bet-
ter idea than this. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1187 is House 
Democrats’ latest attempt to force a 
radical 
progressive 
agenda 
on 
the 
American people by turning the SEC 
into the social policy police. 
While my colleagues across the aisle 
continue to capitulate to the woke 
yuppies, continue to bow down in fear 
to the woke mob, House Republicans 
will fight for policies that help every-
day Americans build better lives for 
themselves. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the previous question and ‘‘no’’ on the 
underlying measure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I don’t know what the gentleman was 
talking about, about woke yuppies and 
all this other kind of stuff he was talk-
ing about here today, but Democrats 
actually believe in science. We believe 
that climate change is real. We believe 
that we ought to have some account-
ability, especially in the corporate 
world, as to what they are doing and 
how they are reporting their actions. 
I find this so concerning that we 
can’t even have a debate on what, in 
fact, the underlying legislation is. I 
think the bill that Congresswoman 
WATERS has brought to the floor is a 
commonsense bill that I hope even 
some Republicans might support. 
I would also say that the other piece 
of legislation that we were talking 
about here today is BARBARA LEE’s bill 
to repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use 
of Military Force. Many of us have 
been urging that we repeal that 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force for quite a while now. It has 
passed the House and it has passed 
committee. Yet here we are again, and 
now we have a President of the United 
States that says that he no longer 
wants that, that he actually supports 
what we are trying to do here. Yet we 
still have people on the House floor 
who say, no, we need to hold onto it, an 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force that we passed almost 20 years 
ago that somehow is applicable today. 
That just doesn’t make any sense to 
me. 
People 
like 
Congresswoman 
LEE; 
Congressman ADAM SMITH; the late Re-
publican Congressman, Walter Jones; 
and 
Congressman 
TOM
COLE
have 
talked about the need for us to reclaim 
our constitutional powers when it 
comes to committing American forces 
into harm’s way. 
Quite frankly, many of us have been 
raising this issue—didn’t matter who 
was in the White House, whether it was 
a Democrat or a Republican—because 
we think it is the right thing to do. We 
think somehow it is cowardice for Con-
gress to just keep on kicking the can 
down the road to ignoring these impor-
tant debates. 
You have those debates, and if people 
decide to continue the same old, same 
old, fine. That is what the majority of 
people here vote for. If people decide to 
end it, that ought to be fine, too. That 
is what we are here for.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2722 
June 14, 2021 
I think this institution would be bet-
ter served if we took our constitutional 
responsibilities with regard to war and 
peace more seriously. 
Today, I hope we will pass this rule 
and we will then pass the Lee bill. But 
it isn’t the end of our work. We are 
going to need to continue to review and 
repeal and reform outdated Authoriza-
tions for Use of Military Force, and we 
need to reimagine the broader issues 
embedded in the War Powers Resolu-
tion, because never again should we ac-
quiesce and allow Congress to sit on 
the sidelines as wars are crafted and 
carried out by the White House, wars 
that never end, wars that sacrifice 
lives and sacrifice treasure. 
Let’s respect our troops. Let’s re-
spect their families. Let’s respect this 
institution. Let’s finally get back to 
doing our jobs, taking responsibility 
and voting on issues of war and peace. 
And let’s start today by supporting 
this rule and the underlying measures. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 473 
At the end of the resolution, add the 
following: 
SEC. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
3403) to limit travel by the Vice President 
until after certain activities are undertaken 
with respect to the southwest border, and for 
other purposes. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 3403. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until ap-
proximately 6:30 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 6 p.m.), the House 
stood in recess. 
b 1833 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker at 6 
o’clock and 33 minutes p.m. 
f 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following communication from the 
Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 4, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Ms. Mandy Vigil, Elections Di-
rector, New Mexico Office of the Secretary of 
State, indicating that, according to the pre-
liminary results of the Special Election held 
June 1, 2021, the Honorable Melanie Ann

Congress for the First Congressional Dis-
trict, State of New Mexico. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
GLORIA J. LETT. 
MAGGIE TOULOUSE OLIVER, 
SECRETARY OF STATE, 
Santa Fe, New Mexico, June 3, 2021. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This is to advise you 
that the unofficial results of the Special 
Election held on Tuesday, June 1, 2021, for 
Representative in Congress from the 1st Con-
gressional District of New Mexico, show that 
Melanie Ann Stansbury received 79,625 votes 
or 60% of the total number of votes cast for 
that office. 
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Melanie Ann Stansbury was elect-
ed as Representative in Congress from the 
1st Congressional District of New Mexico. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief at 
this time, there is no contest to this elec-
tion. 
As soon as the official results are certified 
to this office by all counties involved, an of-
ficial Certificate of Election will be prepared 
for transmittal as required by law. 
Sincerely, 
MANDY VIGIL, 
Election Director, New Mexico 
Office of the Secretary of State.

SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
MELANIE 
A. 
STANSBURY, 
OF 
NEW MEXICO, AS A MEMBER OF 
THE HOUSE 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico, the Hon-
orable MELANIE
ANN
STANSBURY, be 
permitted to take the oath of office 
today. 
Her certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
her election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will Representative- 
elect STANSBURY and the members of 
the New Mexico delegation present 
themselves in the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise her 
right hand. 
Ms. STANSBURY appeared at the bar 
of the House and took the oath of of-
fice, as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that you will bear true faith 
and allegiance to the same; that you take 
this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now a Member of the 117th Con-
gress. 
f 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
MELANIE A. STANSBURY TO THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. HERRELL) is recognized for 1 
minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
have the distinct honor to rise today as 
the dean of our delegation to introduce 
the newest Member of the House of 
Representatives from New Mexico’s 
First Congressional District: MELANIE 
STANSBURY. 
Melanie was born in Farmington and 
grew up in the North Valley and west 
side of Albuquerque. She is from a 
hardworking family that typifies mil-
lions of New Mexicans. MELANIE’s 
mother supported her family as a 
seamstress and heavy equipment oper-
ator. Her family owned a landscaping 
and irrigation business, where she 
worked growing up. 
After graduating from Cibola High 
School, she attended St. Mary’s College 
in California and went on to graduate 
studies at Cornell University. She 
came home and served our State as a 
science instructor through the Museum 
of Natural History, visiting schools 
across the State. 
Before she was elected to office, 
MELANIE
served our Nation here in 
Washington at the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, and the U.S. Senate 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Congresswoman STANSBURY has been 
shown to be a dedicated public servant, 
and I know she does not take her new 
role lightly. I pray that God will guide 
her in her decisions, strengthen her 
during trials, and bless all of us in pub-
lic service with wisdom and grace. 
Today, please help me welcome the 
newest Member of the House from the 
Land of Enchantment, Congresswoman 
MELANIE STANSBURY. 
The SPEAKER. We welcome back to 
the House three former Members of the 
House: Senator HEINRICH; Senator BEN 
RAY LUJA´ N; and visiting from Wash-
ington State, Senator CANTWELL.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2723 
June 14, 2021 
The gentlewoman from New Mexico 
is recognized. 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as the newest Representa-
tive for New Mexico’s First Congres-
sional District. 
As Secretary Deb Haaland said in her 
farewell before this body: We are called 
to service in different ways. 
I stand here today because I believe 
that we are called to build a world that 
is more just, more equitable, and more 
resilient. 
I ran for Congress because I believe 
deeply in our communities and our 
ability to bring meaningful change, 
and that the weight of history and of 
all future generations is on us to do so. 
As a New Mexican, I know that we 
are strong and we are proud and that 
our work is to lift up our communities 
to fight for the dignity and well-being 
of our people, to rebuild our economy, 
and to tackle the biggest challenges of 
our day. We are called to do this work 
because the moment is now, and our fu-
ture depends upon it, which is why I, 
Madam Speaker, am so proud to be 
able to serve alongside you as New 
Mexico’s next Congresswoman. 
f

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-

Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 14, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives,

DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the

TRIUMPH INCORPORATED 
PROVIDES QUALITY CHILDCARE 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of investing in 
our care economy. 
Recently, I visited Triumph Incor-
porated, a Head Start program in the 
city of Taunton in my district. Tri-
umph provides low-cost and high-qual-
ity early education and childcare for 
children in our community. 
Senator WARREN and I heard from 
parents about the impact Triumph 
made on their lives. In addition to car-
ing for their children, the facility pro-
vided a space for community and 
friendship for young families. From 
kindergarten readiness to nurturing 
children 
with 
developmental 
dif-
ferences, the educators and administra-
tors at Triumph show up for those in 
need. 
Every family in America deserves ac-
cess to high-quality, affordable, and ac-
cessible early childhood education and 
childcare. By investing in caregiving, 
we will help Americans get back to 
work, create good-paying jobs, and 
build an economy that works for every-
one.

Becky has also helped develop the 311 
call centers to help residents with non-

Mayor Ames’ most significant con-
tributions to our district include the 
emergency preparation and manage-
ment before and after several tropical 
storms and hurricanes that have im-
pacted Beaumont. Mayor Ames’ experi-
ence 
and 
leadership 
during 
these 
storms were instrumental to recovery 
efforts and restoring Beaumont’s infra-
structure. I have seen them up close 
and personal. 
I recognize and I thank Mayor Becky 
Ames for her many years of selfless 
service to Beaumont and our 14th Con-
gressional District of Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Becky on her well-earned retirement.

RECOGNIZING SHERIFF CRAIG 
NOBLES 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sher-
iff Craig Nobles of Long County, Geor-
gia, for his heroic actions saving 22 
dogs on May 24, 2021. 
Sheriff Nobles was responding to a 
brush fire and discovered 22 dogs tied 
to trees in the wood line. After con-
taining the scene, first responders suc-
cessfully saved all 22 dogs that are now 
safe and healthy. 
The First Congressional District is 
fortunate to have Sheriff Nobles serv-
ing and protecting not only the people 
in the community, but man’s best 
friend as well. 
After seeing the faces of the 22 dogs, 
I am thankful for the first responders 
who rescued these dogs that are now 
able to find a loving home. 
I am proud to rise today to congratu-
late Sheriff Nobles, the Long County 
Sheriff’s Office, and the Long County 
Fire Department for their great work 
in saving these precious animals. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CHASE GROGAN 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, recently, 
my friend Jean Donaldson was driving 
home late one afternoon and had a tire 
blow out. 
Jean stopped in the parking lot of 
the business Clean & Dry, where Chase 
Grogan, an employee of the business, 
noticed her plight and offered to help. 
Despite it being near quitting time, 
Chase insisted on helping Jean and pro-
ceeded to change her tire so that she 
could get home. Jean was, of course, 
grateful 
and 
offered 
compensation, 
which he declined. 
We often come to the floor to praise 
people who have done extraordinary 
acts, and we should continue to do 
that. However, it is good for us to ac-
knowledge all the Chase Grogans of the 
world who, every day, do extraordinary 
acts of kindness with little recogni-
tion. 
By acknowledging Mr. Grogan, we 
are acknowledging all who do those 
kindnesses every day. 
f 
CONGRATULATING VICKI 
CHRISTIANSEN 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate and congratulate USDA Forest 
Service Chief Vicki Christiansen on her 
recently announced retirement. 
Chief Christiansen has dedicated 40 
years 
as 
a 
professional 
forester, 
wildland firefighter, and land manager. 
I have had the great privilege of 
working with Vicki and appreciated 
her visit to the Allegheny National 
Forest. 
While visiting, it was made clear her 
passion 
for 
problem-solving, 
con-
necting people with their natural re-
sources, and her commitment to local 
collaboration. 
The ANF is Pennsylvania’s only na-
tional forest, and it plays a vital role 
in our communities throughout the re-
gion. 
Vicki’s work as USDA Forest Service 
chief focused on saved natural re-
sources in ways that promote lasting 
economic, ecological, and social vital-
ity for all communities. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Vicki 
Christiansen for her leadership, dedica-
tion, passion, and advocacy for our Na-
tion’s national forests in rural areas. 
May she enjoy her retirement. 
f 
RECOGNIZING FLAG DAY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today we celebrate the adoption of the 
stars and stripes as the official flag of 
our Nation. In 1777, six years before the 
end of the Revolutionary War, is when 
it was adopted by Congress. 
Over the past year, however, we have 
seen a constant stream of disrespect 
for our stars and stripes. 
We expect the flag to perhaps be 
beaten and burned on the streets of 
Beijing or in the Middle East or other 
cities of our global adversaries, but we 
do not expect that to happen within 
the United States. 
This past year, we have all fought 
against the raising of political flags in 
military bases and atop our embassies 
and consulates. Our flag is the only 
flag that belongs above those buildings. 
Our flag is a symbol of hope and 
unity. 
I hope today, of all days, we can re-
member who fought to raise the flag 
and why. 
f 
REAFFIRMING TRANSATLANTIC 
SOLIDARITY 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co- 
chair of the bipartisan Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, I rise to reaffirm 
transatlantic solidarity in advance of 
President Biden’s meeting with Rus-
sian dictator Vladimir Putin. 
I am so thankful to President Biden, 
who is personally committed to liberty 
in Ukraine. I was proud to travel with 
him and Senator McCain to Ukraine in 
2015, for President Poroshenko’s inau-
guration. 
As 
President 
Biden 
knows 
well, 
Vladimir Putin is an enemy of liberty. 
Ukraine faces its seventh year of bru-
tal Russian aggression that has led to 
over 
14,000 
deaths. 
Putin’s 
thugs 
gunned down liberty defenders like 
Boris Nemtsov and so many more free-
dom lovers. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD Amnesty International’s deep-
ly troubling human rights report on 
Russia. 
RUSSIA 
Russian Federation 
Head of state: Vladimir Putin 
Head of government: Mikhail Mishustin 
(replaced Dmitry Medvedev in January) 
The COVID–19 pandemic exposed chronic 
under-resourcing in health care. The au-
thorities used the pandemic as a pretext to 
continue the crackdown on all dissent, in-
cluding through amendments to a vaguely 
worded law on ‘‘fake news’’ and tightening 
restrictions on public gatherings. Peaceful 
protesters, human rights defenders and civic 
and political activists faced arrest and pros-
ecution. Persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses 
intensified. Torture remained endemic, as 
did near total impunity for perpetrators. The 
right to a fair trial was routinely violated 
while legal amendments resulted in a further 
reduction in judicial independence. Reports 
of domestic violence rose sharply during 
COVID–19 lockdown measures, although the 
draft law on domestic violence remained 
stalled in Parliament. LGBTI people contin-
ued to face discrimination and persecution. 
Thousands of labour migrants lost their jobs 
during the pandemic but were unable to 
leave because of border closures. Evidence 
emerged to corroborate allegations of war 
crimes by Russian forces in Syria. 
BACKGROUND 
The economic downturn, underpinned by 
falling oil prices, dwindling investment and 
foreign sanctions, and exacerbated by the 
COVID–19 pandemic, led to a further impov-
erishment of a growing proportion of the 
population. Discontent widened, with a slow 
but steady increase in protests. The govern-
ment continually faced, and ignored, mount-
ing allegations of corruption at all levels. 
Measures announced by President Vladimir 
Putin and his government, like extended 
fully paid leave for all workers in response to 
COVID–19, failed to address people’s broader 
concerns.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2727 
June 14, 2021 
The 
authorities 
introduced 
multiple 
amendments to the Constitution, with the 
apparent purpose of removing legal restric-
tions on President Putin’s participation in 
future presidential elections. 
Russia maintained a strong influence on 
its immediate neighbours, and its occupation 
of Crimea and other territories continued. 
RIGHT TO HEALTH 
The COVID–19 pandemic placed further 
strain on the health care system, exposing 
chronic under-resourcing. A shortage of hos-
pital beds, key protective and medical equip-
ment and medications, together with the de-
layed wages of health workers, were fre-
quently reported across the country. Official 
and independent numbers on infection and 
mortality rates varied greatly, indicating 
government under-reporting. 
Health workers 
Whistle-blowers from among health work-
ers and other groups faced reprisals, includ-
ing disciplinary measures and prosecution 
for ‘‘fake news’’. 
Doctor Tatyana Revva was arbitrarily rep-
rimanded and threatened with dismissal 
after she repeatedly complained about the 
shortage and inadequacy of protective equip-
ment. Police considered and dismissed ‘‘fake 
news’’ allegations against her following a 
complaint from the hospital’s head doctor. 
Prison conditions 
Health care and sanitary provisions in pen-
itentiary institutions remained inadequate 
and further exacerbated by the pandemic. Al-
though the authorities implemented restric-
tive and additional sanitary measures, they 
did not take measures to reduce the prison 
population. Official COVID–19 figures in cus-
tody were considered unreliable by inde-
pendent monitors. 
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY 
Freedom of peaceful assembly remained 
constrained with further restrictions intro-
duced in December. The rules relating to 
public assemblies and single-person pickets 
were further restricted in response to the 
pandemic, and some regions banned them 
outright. Public protests were typically 
small but regular, despite reprisals. There 
was a sharp increase in the numbers of single 
picketers arrested and prosecuted. 
On 15 July, over a hundred peaceful pro-
testers against constitutional changes were 
arbitrarily arrested and at least three se-
verely beaten by the police in Moscow. Doz-
ens were heavily fined or detained for five to 
14 days. 
The 9 July arrest of Sergey Furgal, who in 
2018 had defeated the pro-Kremlin candidate 
to be elected Governor in the Far East 
Khabarovsk Region, prompted weekly peace-
ful mass protests in Khabarovsk as well as 
solidarity protests across Russia. Unusually, 
tens of thousands were allowed to march re-
peatedly in Khabarovsk before police made 
the first arrests on 18 July. On 10 October, 
police dispersed the protest for the first 
time, arresting at least 25 people, with at 
least five later sentenced to several days in 
detention. The protests in Khabarovsk were 
continuing at year’s end. 
In 
December, 
peaceful 
protester 
Konstantin Kotov was released following his 
imprisonment in 2019 for ‘‘repeated viola-
tion’’ of regulations on public assemblies. In 
January, the Constitutional Court had or-
dered a review of his case, and in April, the 
Moscow City Court reduced his sentence 
from four years to 18 months. Others pros-
ecuted for the same offence included polit-
ical activist Yulia Galyamina, who was given 
a two-year conditional sentence in Decem-
ber, activist Vyacheslav Egorov standing 
trial in Kolomna, and protester Aleksandr 
Prikhodko from Khabarovsk. In December, 
Aleksandr Prikhodko’s case was dropped. 
While police routinely used excessive and 
unnecessary force against protesters, they 
also allowed anti-protester violence by other 
groups. In Kushtau, Bashkiria, peaceful envi-
ronmental activists who opposed a local min-
ing project were repeatedly assaulted, with 
impunity, by private security staff, occasion-
ally operating alongside police. Late on 9 
August, around 30 private security guards 
and around 100 masked men attacked a camp 
of 10 environmental activists. Police were 
called but did not intervene. This triggered 
further local protests which forced the clo-
sure of the mining project in late August. 
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION 
Restrictions on freedom of expression con-
tinued. On 1 April, amendments to the so- 
called ‘‘fake news’’ law, first passed in 2019, 
criminalized dissemination of ‘‘knowingly 
false information about circumstances pos-
ing a threat to the lives and security of citi-
zens and/or about the government’s actions 
to protect the population.’’ Individuals face 
up to five years’ imprisonment if dissemina-
tion of information leads to bodily harm or 
death, with hefty fines for the media. Hun-
dreds of people were fined under administra-
tive proceedings, and at least 37 faced crimi-
nal proceedings under this law, many of 
them critical civil activists, journalists or 
bloggers. At least five media outlets were 
prosecuted. The newspaper Novaya Gazeta 
and its chief editor were fined twice, in Au-
gust and September, for publications about 
COVID–19 and ordered to delete respective 
articles online. 
Journalists 
Harassment, prosecution and physical at-
tacks against journalists continued. On 30 
June, police in Saint Petersburg assaulted 
reporter David Frenkel at a polling station 
and broke his arm. On 15 October, a jour-
nalist from Khabarovsk, Sergei Plotnikov, 
was abducted by masked men, driven to the 
woods, beaten and subjected to a mock exe-
cution. He reported the incident to the police 
once released but by year’s end, he had not 
been informed about any investigation. 
A journalist from Nizhnii Novgorod, Irina 
Slavina, faced routine harassment by the au-
thorities. On 1 October, her home was raided 
and searched, and police summoned her as a 
witness in a criminal case against a local ac-
tivist under the ‘‘undesirable organizations’’ 
law. On 2 October, she died after self- 
immolating in protest in front of the re-
gional police headquarters. 
On 6 July, a military court in Pskov con-
victed journalist Svetlana Prokopieva of 
‘‘public justification of terrorism’’ and fined 
her RUB500,000 (US$6,300) for her public com-
ments on repressive policies that may have 
motivated a 17-year-old to blow himself up 
near the Federal Security Service building 
in Arkhangelsk. 
Internet 
Censorship of the internet continued. In 
June, the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECtHR) in Vladimir Kharitonov v. Russia 
and three other cases ruled that internet- 
blocking measures were ‘‘excessive and arbi-
trary’’ and violated the right to impart and 
receive information. A court in Moscow fined 
Google RUBl.5 million (US$18,899) in August 
and RUB3 million (US$40,580) in December 
for its search engine listing ‘‘dangerous con-
tent’’ banned by Russian authorities. In De-
cember, President Putin signed a law intro-
ducing sanctions on foreign internet plat-
forms for blocking Russian media content. 
Another law passed in December introduced 
imprisonment for libel committed via the 
internet. 
Repression of dissent 
Opposition activists and other dissenting 
voices faced severe reprisals. As part of the 
politically motivated criminal case against 
opposition 
leader 
Alexei 
Navalny’s 
AntiCorruption Fund, 126 bank accounts be-
longing to his associates were frozen in Jan-
uary, followed by criminal and civil libel 
cases against Alexei Navalny and others. On 
20 August, Alexei Navalny was taken ill on a 
flight from Tomsk. He was urgently hos-
pitalized, and later flown to Germany where 
he was diagnosed with poisoning by a mili-
tary-grade nerve agent. The Russian authori-
ties failed to investigate the poisoning. 
Siberian shaman Aleksandr Gabyshev, who 
had vowed to ‘‘purge’’ President Putin from 
the Kremlin, was on 12 May confined to a 
psychiatric hospital after he refused to be 
tested for COVID–19. He was discharged on 22 
July following criticism in Russia and 
abroad. 
In 
June, 
political 
blogger 
Nikolay 
Platoshkin was placed under house arrest on 
criminal charges of ‘‘calls to mass disturb-
ances’’ and dissemination of ‘‘knowingly 
false information’’ for planning a peaceful 
protest against constitutional amendments. 
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
Harassment, prosecution, and physical at-
tacks against human rights defenders re-
mained commonplace. 
Activists 
Alexandra 
Koroleva, 
in 
Kaliningrad, and Semyon Simonov, in Sochi, 
were charged and faced possible imprison-
ment for non-payment of arbitrary and 
heavy fines by their respective NGOs. 
Journalist Elena Milashina and lawyer Ma-
rina Dubrovina were assaulted by a mob in a 
hotel in Grozny, Chechyna, on 6 February. A 
formal investigation started in March but 
was 
manifestly 
ineffective. 
Meanwhile, 
Chechen head Ramzan Kadyrov issued thinly 
veiled 
death 
threats 
against 
Elena 
Milashina, with impunity. 
Lawyer Mikhail Benyash’s appeal against 
his criminal conviction—which could lead to 
disbarment—started in October and was still 
ongoing at year’s end. 
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION 
Laws on ‘‘foreign agents’’ and ‘‘undesirable 
organizations’’ were actively used to smear 
independent NGOs, deprive them of funding 
and severely penalize their members. In De-
cember, 
further 
draconian 
legislative 
changes were signed into law, including to 
extend the ‘‘foreign agents’’ provisions to 
NGOs staff, unregistered groups and individ-
uals. 
In April, the education NGO Projectoria 
was forced to register as a ‘‘foreign agent’’ to 
avoid fines while its foreign donor, Project 
Harmony, was declared ‘‘undesirable’’. 
In October, activist Yana Antonova from 
Krasnodar was sentenced to 240 hours of 
forced labour for association with an ‘‘unde-
sirable organization’’, re-posting Open Rus-
sia-branded materials online and taking part 
in single person pickets. She was subse-
quently fined again under new administra-
tion proceedings. 
FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND BELIEF 
The prosecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses 
under ‘‘extremism’’ charges escalated, in-
cluding in occupied Crimea, with a growing 
number of convictions, and longer sentences. 
At year’s end, 362 people were under inves-
tigation or standing trial, 39 had been con-
victed and six were imprisoned. Artem 
Gerasimov, for example, was sentenced on 
appeal in June to six years’ imprisonment 
and a fine of RUB400,000 (US$5,144) by the de 
facto Supreme Court of Crimea. 
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT 
Torture and other ill-treatment remained 
pervasive, and the number of perpetrators 
convicted was negligible. Prosecutions were 
typically for ‘‘abuse of authority’’ and re-
sulted in lenient sentences.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2728 
June 14, 2021 
Twelve 
former 
prison 
officers 
from 
Yaroslavil colony were sentenced to up to 
four years and three months’ imprisonment 
after a leaked video showed an inmate being 
beaten in 2017. Six of them were immediately 
released on account of time already spent in 
detention. The former head and deputy head 
of the colony were acquitted. 
UNFAIR TRIALS 
Violations of the right to a fair trial re-
mained common. Detainees were denied 
meetings with their lawyers and a number of 
trials continued to be closed to the public, 
with the COVID–19 pandemic being often 
abusively used as a justification. 
In February and June respectively, seven 
young men from Penza, and two from Saint 
Petersburg, received sentences of up to 18 
years’ imprisonment under trumped-up ter-
rorism charges over their purported involve-
ment with a non-existent organization called 
‘‘Network’’. Numerous allegations of torture 
and other ill-treatment, and of fabrication of 
evidence, were ignored. 
Constitutional and legislative amendments 
further eroded the right to a fair trial, in-
cluding by giving the President power to 
nominate the judges of the Constitutional 
and Supreme Courts, and initiate the ap-
pointment of all federal judges and dismissal 
of senior federal judges. 
Counter-terrorism 
Counterterrorism legislation was widely 
abused, often to target dissent. 
Journalist Abdulmumin Gadzhiev, from 
Dagestan, remained in custody under fab-
ricated charges of financing terrorism and 
participation in terrorist and extremist or-
ganizations. His trial started in November. 
In occupied Crimea, allegations of mem-
bership of the Islamist organization Hizb-ut- 
Tahrir (labelled as a ‘‘terrorist’’ movement 
by Russia in 2003) were widely used to im-
prison ethnic Crimean Tatars. In June, Cri-
mean human rights defender Emir-Usein 
Kuku lost the appeal against his 12-year pris-
on sentence. In September, another Crimean 
human rights defender, Server Mustafayev, 
was sentenced to 14 years in prison. 
In September, 19 men from Ufa, Bashkira, 
convicted for alleged Hiz-ut-Tahrir member-
ship and sentenced to between 10 and 24 
years, lost their appeal, with one defendant’s 
sentence reduced by a year. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS 
Proposals to introduce legislation on do-
mestic violence remained stalled in Par-
liament, while NGOs reported a sharp in-
crease 
in 
domestic 
violence 
following 
COVID–19 lockdown measures. 
In June, the ECtHR held a Polshina v. Rus-
sia that deficiencies in the legal system re-
lated to domestic violence violated the pro-
hibitions of torture and discrimination. The 
Court underlined Russia’s consistent failure 
to investigate abuse, and years-long toler-
ance of ‘‘a climate which was conducive to 
domestic violence’’. 
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, 
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX (LGBTI) PEOPLE 
LGBTI people continued to face discrimi-
nation 
and 
persecution. 
Constitutional 
amendments redefined marriage as a ‘‘union 
between a man and woman’’, reinforcing ex-
isting limitations on same-sex couples. 
LGBTI rights activist Yulia Tsvetkova was 
fined RUB75,000 (US$1,014) for posting online 
her drawings in support of same-sex couples 
and faced other penalities, including ongoing 
presecution for pornography relating to her 
body positive drawings featuring female 
genitalia. 
MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS 
Over a third of foreign labour migrants re-
ported having lost work owing to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and thousands were 
stranded in Russia due to related border clo-
sures. In April, a presidential decree eased 
work permit and residency rules for mi-
grants and refugees, and temporarily sus-
pended forcible returns of foreign and state-
less individuals. Some regional authorities 
ceased temporary detention of migrants, al-
though new decisions on forcible returns 
were also reported. 
UNLAWFUL ATTACKS 
Evidence including witness statements, 
videos, photographs and satellite imagery of 
seven air strikes against medical facilities 
and schools by Russian forces, and four by 
Syrian or Russian forces, between May 2019 
and February 2020 in Syria, corroborated al-
legations of serious violations of inter-
national humanitarian law amounting to 
war crimes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, a suc-
cessful meeting with Putin can only be 
accomplished proceeding from a posi-
tion of strength. 
While I am deeply concerned the ad-
ministration waived Nord Stream 2 
sanctions, 
I 
am 
pleased 
President 
Biden invited President Zelensky to a 
White House visit. I am also grateful 
the administration announced $150 mil-
lion in security assistance to Ukraine. 
This week, President Biden has an 
opportunity to pivot from the Trump 
administration’s disastrous legacy that 
left the transatlantic relationship in 
tatters. The Congress and our caucus 
stand ready to work with the adminis-
tration to counter Russian aggression 
by increasing Ukraine’s security and 
democracy assistance. 
Onward liberty. Onward Ukraine. 
f 
OFFERING SYMPATHY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise as a fellow Texan to offer my 
deepest sympathy to my fellow con-
gressional colleagues in the Austin 
area, to the local officials, and to all of 
those who suffered the brutality of the 
mass shooting in the last couple of 
days—14—and my deepest sympathy to 
the family of the deceased loved one, 
who mourns today. 
Out of respect for his family, I will 
just simply say we mourn him, and we 
are saddened by his loss. 
Madam Speaker, in Texas, the Gov-
ernor just signed a permitless gun bill. 
All statistics suggest that this provides 
for a shopping spree of guns. 
It is important for three things to 
happen for our Nation to raise its 
voices against gun violence and to 
begin to pass sensible gun safety laws, 
including my legislation for gun stor-
age, universal background checks, clos-
ing the Charleston loophole, to prevent 
ghost guns, and banning assault weap-
ons. 
At the same time, we must raise up 
the specter of mental health services. 
But most of all, as I chair the Sub-
committee on Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security, we must raise our 
voice against violence and actually 
deal with it and try to cease it. I be-
lieve America must do this. 
f 
CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the subject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise this evening for the Congres-
sional Black Caucus Special Order hour 
that deals with, of course, Juneteenth, 
a very special time that I am de-
lighted—with the leadership of our 
chair, Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY; 
and, of course, my coanchor, Congress-
man TORRES
of New York—that we 
stand here to provide this kind of lead-
ership for this Congress and for this 
Nation. 
Let me extend my heartfelt apprecia-
tion for all of the leadership that have 
given us this time, including Speaker 
PELOSI and, of course, Leader HOYER, 
and to acknowledge the significance to 
African Americans as it relates to 
Juneteenth. 
Coming from Texas, let me tell you 
that Juneteenth, a couple days from 
today, will be an amazing commemora-
tion. We will be unveiling a mural in 
Galveston, where General Granger first 
came. I believe thousands will come. 
And if there will not be thousands, let 
you hear my voice: Thousands should 
come because what a historic moment. 
What does Juneteenth mean? 
It means an acknowledgment of 
those who were in bondage for over 200 
years. The Emancipation Proclama-
tion—which, by the way, for the 150th 
commemoration, because we had not 
finished our congressional work, I was 
actually here at midnight—which is 
when 
President 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
signed it at the National Archives. 
Looking at the original Emancipation 
Proclamation, what a sense of emotion. 
But then to let you know that that 
did not free all of the slaves. Two years 
in bondage continued for those west of 
the Mississippi and many States until 
General Granger reached the shores of 
Galveston, still marked today in Texas, 
that said that you were free. 
Can you imagine? Two extra years of 
bondage. Couldn’t get out. Couldn’t 
read a newspaper or hold up a message 
that had come from your relative that 
lived in Georgia. Couldn’t do anything. 
General Granger read these words of 
General Order Number 3, set off a joy-
ous celebration of the freed men and 
women of Texas. I have no shame that 
it was called Jubilee. And there were a 
lot of picnics and what we called in the 
later years ‘‘red punch.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2729 
June 14, 2021 
Don’t diminish our celebration. Don’t 
diminish that joy in the midst of sor-
row. 
How many died who could not see 
freedom? 
Here are the words: ‘‘The people of 
Texas are informed that, in accordance 
with the Proclamation from the Execu-
tive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality 
of rights and rights of property be-
tween former masters and slaves, and 
the connection heretofore existing be-
tween them becomes that between em-
ployer and hired laborer.’’ 
Now, the word was said that they 
were offered, the slaves: Don’t worry 
about it, just stay on the plantations, 
and we will pay you. 
I am grateful, but those courageous, 
but 
impoverished, 
without 
insight, 
without resources, without compensa-
tion, without recognition, they said in 
their own power: We are leaving the 
plantations. 
And they migrated up this road 
called Emancipation Trail. 
I am gratified that I was able to in-
troduce such legislation where my Sen-
ate colleague, Senator CORNYN, joined 
me and now an Emancipation Trail has 
been established as law. It is now under 
study. It will be only the second com-
memoration of African-American his-
tory in this Nation. The Selma to 
Montgomery is the first, and now the 
Emancipation Trail that says: No, I 
was not going stay on the plantation; 
however, I was going to survive; what-
ever I had to place together, I was 
going to do it. 
Then, of course, lo and behold, they 
found themselves—eight of them, freed 
slaves, put their money together and 
purchased the first park bought in the 
State of Texas by freed slaves or any-
one. They called it Emancipation Park. 
So that is why we are here to cele-
brate and to educate this idea of what 
it means to celebrate Juneteenth. I am 
delighted that we have introduced a 
resolution that is bipartisan. But the 
most exciting part about this is that I 
have introduced a bill that establishes 
Juneteenth as a national Federal holi-
day. Not removing any other holiday, 
but adding it to the list. Cosponsored 
by Senator MARKEY and Senator COR-
NYN, and bipartisan. Over 160 cospon-
sors in the House. 
I think it is worthy to have a holi-
day—a Federal holiday established, and 
I am very proud to have been the 
Congressperson for Representative Al 
Edwards, who is called the father of 
Juneteenth, establishing the first paid 
State holiday in the State of Texas 
highlighting, 
honoring, 
revering 
Juneteenth. 
You will hear many of us continue 
our discussions about Juneteenth, its 
significance in terms of freedom. And I 
am delighted, as I said, to be co-
anchoring with my colleague. It is im-
portant to express our appreciation to 
our chair, the Honorable BARBARA LEE, 
a Californian but born in Texas with a 
grandfather born in Galveston. She 
knows what Juneteenth, the signifi-
cance, the power of it is, and her legis-
lative legacy speaks to freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the Hon-
orable BARBARA LEE. 
b 1945 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, first of all, let me thank the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) for yielding but also for her tre-
mendous leadership and for the Eman-
cipation Trail that she so boldly led. I 
am just amazed at what she shared 
with me earlier today and just now on 
the floor. 
Because, yes, I am a daughter of 
Texas. My grandfather was born in 
1875—10 years after. And my grand-
mother may have been part of the 
Emancipation Trail. She was born 
probably 
in—they 
left 
Galveston 
around 1900. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. She would have 
been part of it at a later time, but that 
trail, since we know for sure there were 
no other ways of moving, she had to 
walk along that semi-developed trail of 
little 
cities 
from 
Galveston—walk 
along, drive along, in whatever capac-
ity, and when I say ‘‘drive along,’’ 
horse and buggy and otherwise. 
That was a trail that the freed 
slaves, the ex-slaves, went from Gal-
veston all the way. There was the 
Reedy A.M.E., if I am correct, one of 
the historic A.M.E. churches where 
they stopped for refuge. Then they 
came on up, and they sought their way 
to freedom. They were not going to 
stay on the plantation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, that sounds like my great- 
grandmother Fanny, who I did not 
know, but my grandfather spoke of her. 
I am certain that she was part of that. 
As I listened to my colleague and 
looked more into my personal family 
history, Galveston, certainly, is in my 
spirit. I guess that is why each and 
every year since I was a child, we con-
tinued to celebrate Juneteenth as our 
liberation day, our emancipation day. 
Historically, we generally recognize 
January 1, 1863, the date when the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation 
was 
signed, as the end of chattel slavery of 
African 
Americans 
in 
the 
United 
States. However, for generations, Afri-
can-American communities have been 
celebrating June 19 as a symbolic date 
representing our freedom from enslave-
ment. 
As 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON
LEE 
mentioned, 
Major 
General 
Gordon 
Granger arrived in Galveston to an-
nounce the end of the Civil War. He 
also declared that the enslaved Afri-
cans were now equal in personal rights 
to that of their former masters, ending 
the inhumane, barbaric subjugation of 
African Americans as property that 
still continued 21⁄2
years after the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation 
was 
signed. 
Again, we are not far removed from 
this history. Citing my grandfather, I 
have to call his name: Mr. W.C. Parish, 
William Calhoun Parish. He was born 
in Galveston, just 10 years after Grang-
er’s Juneteenth announcement. 
Black 
Texans 
began 
celebrating 
Juneteenth the following year, and 
year after year for the last 150-plus 
years. Communities across the Nation 
have created their own traditions and 
events to honor and commemorate this 
historic moment as a day of freedom. 
It is not just a cultural celebration 
for African Americans. It is a true tes-
tament to the endurance of our demo-
cratic ideals of liberty and equality. 
So, we need to pass H.R. 1320, the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act, establishing Juneteenth as a Fed-
eral holiday to further cement the im-
portance of this date in our Nation’s 
historical narrative on freedom. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON 
LEE, again, for introducing this legisla-
tion, and I am a proud cosponsor. The 
last time Congress enacted a Federal 
holiday, I believe it was Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr.’s birthday, and it took 
nearly 20 years for it to pass. We can-
not let this idle. 
Each year, Juneteenth compels us to 
confront the darkest chapter in Amer-
ican history, a chapter born in the Mid-
dle Passage, continued through slav-
ery, and manifested today through sys-
temic racism. Our Nation’s racial past 
has consistently led to inequities in in-
come, 
education, 
employment, 
healthcare, and the wealth gap of Afri-
can Americans. 
We must use Juneteenth to reflect 
upon the dehumanization of enslaved 
Africans in America but also to honor 
their legacy because ‘‘and still we 
rise.’’ 
The labor stolen from enslaved Afri-
cans built this country. Black people 
created some of the most cherished na-
tional symbols, all while considered 
merely three-fifths of a person under 
our Constitution. 
We must honor and recognize the 
millions of men, women, and children 
lost to the brutality of slavery. As a 
Nation, we must reckon with the true 
nature and legacy of slavery in the 
United States and acknowledge how it 
has allowed a false racial hierarchy to 
permeate and infect our society today. 
That is why, Congresswoman JACK-
SON LEE, it is time to pass H.R. 40, leg-
islation to establish a commission to 
study and develop reparations—cham-
pioned, again, by a great Texan—to re-
pair this damage, and my resolution, 
H.R. 19, calling for truth, racial heal-
ing, and transformation. 
It is way too long. It is past overdue. 
We must repair this damage and move 
forward. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. JACK-
SON LEE for this evening. I thank our 
CBC chairwoman, JOYCE BEATTY, and 
our vice chair, Mr. HORSFORD, for this 
Special Order tonight. I think it is very 
important that the history be told of 
Juneteenth and how it connects to 
today and systemic racism. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for honoring my ancestors.

June 14, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is a privilege to be able to have a 
Californian with deep roots in Texas on 
the floor because what this says to our 
body is that this issue of slavery per-
meated all aspects of this Nation. We 
can see that from the work, the com-
mitment, and the compassion of the 
Honorable BARBARA LEE, followed by, 
of course, a native daughter of Wis-
consin who saw it in a different form 
and is compelled to be on the floor 
today and who has championed for the 
impoverished as well and particularly 
championed for those who are experi-
encing modern-day impacts of slavery 
through inequities, through poverty, 
through welfare, and that has been 
treated unfairly. That is the Honorable 
GWEN MOORE from Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding to me and for inviting me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to 
join my CBC colleagues in highlighting 
the importance of honoring the holiday 
and 
continuing 
the 
legacy 
of 
Juneteenth Day, the first one cele-
brated on June 19, 1865. 
As you have heard, this is the date on 
which Union Major General Gordon 
Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to 
announce the end of both the Civil War 
and the inhumane system of legalized 
enslavement of Africans in the United 
States of America. 
Now, it must be noted that this an-
nouncement came 21⁄2 years after Presi-
dent Abraham Lincoln issued an execu-
tive order that most of us know as the 
Emancipation Proclamation. But it is 
an important reminder that our efforts 
to form a more perfect Union don’t 
really have any timeframe or any date, 
but they are ever ongoing. 
Madam Speaker, I want you to know 
that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 
which I hail, we are going to be cele-
brating Juneteenth Day, and it will be 
the 50th anniversary of Juneteenth 
Day. Yes, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, up 
north, we started observing this holi-
day in 1971. It is a long way from Gal-
veston, Texas, making it one of the 
first Northern States to commemorate 
the end of slavery in our country. 
Madam Speaker, this Saturday, we 
will again gather along North King 
Drive to highlight Black culture with 
traditional food, music, youth essay 
contests, marketplaces, pageants, and 
a parade, unofficially marking the 
opening of Milwaukee’s famous sum-
mer festival. This coming Friday, we 
will be raising the Juneteenth flag in 
the State capital of Madison, Wis-
consin, to honor this day. We take 
Juneteenth seriously. 
Madam Speaker, in 1972, the Mil-
waukee Journal Sentinel reported an 
estimated 3,000 people attending our 
second 
annual 
Juneteenth 
festival. 
That number increased over the years, 
and between 160,000 and 170,000 people 
have attended these festivals. The high 
number of festival-goers can be person-
ally attributed to Milwaukee’s notably 
special, historic response to the system 
of slavery and to our efforts to teach 
the young people about Wisconsin’s 
and Milwaukee’s role in ending slavery. 
Now, in 1854, a Missouri slave owner 
traveled to Racine, Wisconsin, the 
place where I was born, 27 miles south 
of Milwaukee, to demand that a run-
away slave by the name of Joshua 
Glover be surrendered under the U.S. 
Fugitive Slave Law. Glover, who had 
been playing cards at the time, was ar-
rested and carried 27 miles north to 
Milwaukee so that he could be in a se-
cure jail until the Federal marshals 
could move Joshua Glover back to Mis-
souri because it was a larger and more 
secure jail. 
Well, when abolitionist newspaper 
editor Sherman Booth heard this, he 
rode through Milwaukee streets calling 
on sympathizers to storm the jail. A 
mob 
of 
5,000 
Milwaukeeans 
out-
numbered the police and demanded the 
keys, but the wardens refused. The 
crowd smashed down the door. Joshua 
Glover 
was 
freed 
and 
successfully 
moved through the Underground Rail-
road to Canada. 
Booth later declared in court: 
I rejoice that the first attempt to convert 
our jail into a slave-pen and our citizens into 
slave-catchers has signally failed. 
The Wisconsin State Supreme Court 
agreed with him and declared the Fed-
eral Fugitive Slave Law unconstitu-
tional in Wisconsin. In fact, in 1850, 
Wisconsin was the first and only State 
to declare the Fugitive Slave Law un-
constitutional. 
As one of my constituents, the cura-
tor of the Wisconsin Black Historical 
Society, noted, the Juneteenth holiday 
signifies that African Americans are 
full citizens of this country, deserving 
of equity and justice. 
Madam Speaker, it is an important 
day of jubilation not only for the de-
scendants of Africans enslaved in the 
United States but for the American 
people as a whole, for it is not just sim-
ply Black history that we are cele-
brating. We are celebrating a victory in 
American history about freedom and 
equality for all of us who call ourselves 
Americans. 
While it may have been the 13th and 
the 14th Amendments of the Constitu-
tion that formally freed the slaves, let 
us continue to observe Juneteenth Day 
as our day of reflection, knowing that 
our ancestors paid in blood and paid it 
forward for the unimaginable toil for 
the freedom recognized on this day. 
As I often tell our young people: 
Freedom just ain’t free, y’all. Our an-
cestors paid for it. And as a tribute to 
them, we have to take responsibility to 
do the best that we can and continue to 
work tirelessly toward justice and eq-
uity in this great land of ours. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I admire 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE and BARBARA LEE 
so much for their efforts around rep-
arations and equity in our society. 
With that good news arriving in Gal-
veston, the push for true equality of 
opportunity continues to this great 
day in our society. We see it reflected 
in the marches, in the movements, in 
the legislation, and in everything that 
we do today, because despite our being 
free, 
we 
see 
the 
disparities 
in 
healthcare, in education, in homeown-
ership, in COVID. 
The struggle is real. The struggle 
continues. And we are here to remind 
everyone that all of us are Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank SHEI-
LA JACKSON LEE for yielding. 
b 2000 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
what a rich and enriching discussion. 
Thank you to the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin. That is why we gathered 
here, to say to America, we come from 
the Midwest, the South, the East, and 
we still find a common bond around the 
question of Juneteenth, reparations, 
and of course, voting rights that are so 
important. 
But as I yield, let me be very clear, 
these are American values. These are 
values that my friends on the other 
side of the aisle could adopt, just like 
I could adopt. 
Why? Because I don’t know anyone 
that would extinguish freedom and 
deny that where there is bondage and 
where freedom comes, we should cele-
brate it, but we should tell the story 
about it, and we should respond to it. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
yield to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS), who has a 
number of historical monuments in 
Florida that indicates her knowledge 
and understanding of freedom. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, as 
you know, our Nation was created with 
the highest ideals and values. Our new 
Nation was set aside to be a beacon of 
hope where we could build our hopes 
and dreams and calm our fears. We are 
known as the home of the brave and 
land of the free. 
Yes, the history is clear, when Presi-
dent 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
signed 
the 
Emancipation Proclamation, America 
demonstrated its ability to rise to its 
values. But America’s history, as we 
all know, is complicated. For it took 2 
years, from January 1 of 1863 to June 19 
of 1865, for the last group of enslaved 
Americans to receive official word that 
they were indeed free. 
But we know today, Madam Speaker, 
that our work is not yet done. We are 
still a work in progress. We the people, 
in order to form a more perfect union, 
we are a work in progress. 
Let us celebrate Juneteenth, as we 
should. But celebrating freedom must 
be more than just a special day. It 
must be a celebration of who as a Na-
tion we say we are; one who says we be-
lieve in justice for all. 
Yes, America celebrates being free, 
celebrates our freedom from physical 
bondage, but we must also celebrate 
freedom from discrimination. We must 
also celebrate freedom from racism. We 
must also celebrate freedom from pov-
erty. We must also celebrate freedom

from injustice. And we must also cele-
brate freedom from complacency. 
Mrs. Coretta Scott King said this: 
‘‘Struggle is a never ending process. 
Freedom is never really won, you earn 
it and win it in every generation.’’ 
Madam Speaker, regardless of the 
color of our skin, what State we are 
from, how much money we have in the 
bank, our religion, our gender, or our 
political party, we all have an obliga-
tion, and we all must carry the torch of 
freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I thank our chair 
who is leading this Special Order. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I can’t imagine with the recounting of 
the story by VAL DEMINGS that we are 
not securing, how should I say it, mul-
tiple numbers of Members to join in 
the holiday pronouncement and resolu-
tion, and bill, rather, of Juneteenth, to 
support H.R. 40, and to recognize the 
value of commemorating and teaching 
about the history of African Ameri-
cans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON), a 
person who has great knowledge and is 
a great storyteller, a fighter for jus-
tice, and a fellow member of the Judi-
ciary Committee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
leading this Special Order today on be-
half of the Congressional Black Caucus 
as we rise together to celebrate the Af-
rican-American 
community 
and 
to 
commemorate 
an 
unsung 
holiday 
known as Juneteenth. 
Now, I was 21 years old when I first 
heard of Juneteenth. That was the year 
that I arrived in Texas to go to law 
school at Texas Southern University. 
Having been born here in the District 
of Columbia, somewhat north—some 
folks say it is south, but I considered it 
to be the north, but now I accept it as 
being in the south. 
Back then, I didn’t learn anything 
about Juneteenth living here in Wash-
ington, D.C., nor did I learn about it 
when I moved south to Atlanta at the 
age of 17. So the first time I heard was 
in Texas, and it was a joyful celebra-
tion, a joyful day. But since I have left 
Texas and gone back to Georgia, we 
don’t really celebrate Juneteenth in 
Georgia. 
Right now, this year, will constitute 
the first county in Georgia—it would 
be my home county, DeKalb County— 
that 
will 
recognize 
and 
celebrate 
Juneteenth as a holiday. And it is a 
holiday that should be enjoyed by all of 
Americans, not just by Black people, 
but by White people, too, because when 
one of us are in bondage, it means all 
of us are in bondage. When all of us are 
free is when we are truly free. 
So Juneteenth marks the 156th cele-
bration of the ending of slavery in this 
Nation, and since then we have made 
significant strides in the expansion of 
civil rights. We have outlawed segrega-
tion, integrated our schools, and done 
important work to increase access to 
the polls. 
Nonetheless, even 156 years later, 
America and the way her laws are ap-
plied remain biased against the Black 
man. 
Our 
neighborhoods 
and 
our 
schools are still subject to de facto seg-
regation, and schools with larger Afri-
can-American populations are unlikely 
to receive adequate funding and sup-
port. 
Our justice system is a continuation 
of this systemic bias. Under the guise 
of public protection, we arrest and 
forcibly confine African Americans five 
times as often as White Americans for 
the exact same crimes. Now, these re-
alities directly contradict American 
ideals. 
And 
so 
on 
this 
anniversary 
of 
Juneteenth, I believe the best way to 
celebrate the community and honor 
our past is to take deliberate action to 
make our country a just and equitable 
home for all Americans. 
But how can we do that when Repub-
licans are now on this issue called crit-
ical race theory, and they want to ban 
all discussion about this legal concept 
that they have turned into a political 
football. It was a legal concept that 
now has taken on some kind of a das-
tardly meaning. 
And the only thing it is, is first an 
acknowledgment that the vestiges of 
racism, the vestiges of slavery and rac-
ism still exist in this country, and a 
discussion about how it impacts our 
current reality. That is all that we are 
talking about. We are talking about re-
alizing history, celebrating history in 
the case of Juneteenth. We have a lot 
to celebrate, and all of us should cele-
brate, but we cannot do that unless we 
know what our history is. 
And my friends on the other side of 
the aisle are taking deliberate acts now 
to suppress it. I told you, I just heard 
about it, you know, when I was 21 years 
old. You know, we need our people to 
know about this. We need America to 
know about it, and we can all celebrate 
together, just like we do with all the 
other holidays like Thanksgiving, for 
instance. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t mean to be 
divisive, but I do want to speak truth. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
as I get ready to yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from Las Vegas, Ne-
vada, I want to make sure he lets me 
know my pronunciation is correct, it is 
a very sensitive question. 
But as the gentleman from Georgia 
leaves, let me at least acknowledge 
that critical race theory. Here is the 
question I ask: Should I not know 
about Italians and how they came and 
were treated? Should I not know about 
the Irish who left in the midst of the 
potato famine and faced discrimina-
tion? Should I not know about Native 
Americans? 
So we are the American experiment. 
Does everybody realize that? No one 
thought that we would ever survive, 
and we have come together with a mul-
titude of groups. Our strength is in the 
recognition of our differences, and in 
our unity. 
This came out of Texas. This Rep-
resentative is all over. He misinter-
prets the teaching by teachers. He has 
never sat in the class to know that 
teachers are not condemning, they are 
just educating. Isn’t it wonderful in lit-
tle babies’ minds to not put condemna-
tion but to put understanding so that 
we can appreciate each other’s condi-
tion? 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield to the gentleman from Nevada 
(Mr. HORSFORD), who is the first vice 
chair of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus but sits on the Ways and Means 
Committee. And if he will allow me, I 
just want to make this point. 
You are seeing Members of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, and I can tell 
you our agenda is as wide and varied as 
America, from taxation to agriculture 
to tech to criminal justice to the issues 
that American is facing, job creation. 
But we also understand that we 
would be remiss if we did not stand on 
the floor to be able to give our own life 
experiences and to share with America 
what the value of our diversity is all 
about. 
Madam Speaker, I now yield to the 
gentleman 
from 
Nevada 
(Mr. 
HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas, the esteemed Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE, for her yielding 
and her leadership in anchoring this 
Special Order hour along with our col-
league, Congressman TORRES. 
I commend both of them for the lead-
ership that they provide in bringing 
our voice as the Congressional Black 
Caucus to the floor of the House of 
Representatives during this Special 
Order hour. 
Madam Speaker, I thank our Chair-
woman JOYCE BEATTY for recognizing 
just how important it is for the Con-
gressional Black Caucus to speak on so 
many important issues. 
Today is the commemoration for the 
Juneteenth holiday that we now recog-
nize and to commemorate June 19th, 
1865, when some of the last enslaved 
people in the United States learned 
that they were free. 
But as my colleagues have spoken 
about here tonight, more than 2 years 
before the first Juneteenth, President 
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proc-
lamation, freeing enslaved people in 
Confederate States. 
Instead, though, slave owners hid the 
news of emancipation and kept free 
people in captivity, but on Juneteenth 
the 
truth 
set 
them 
free. 
And 
Juneteenth is now a celebration, a 
commemoration of the power of that 
truth. 
A lot of people want to hide our his-
tory, they want to not speak about the 
truth of our history, but there are 
truths, like emancipation, that merit 
us speaking and celebrating and com-
memorating, as we are doing. But we 
also must reckon with the horrors of 
this past that is also part of the United 
States history.

b 2015 
As we honor Juneteenth, we must re-
member the decades of Jim Crow laws 
and white supremacist terror that fol-
lowed even after the freeing of enslaved 
Black peoples. We must remember the 
Tulsa race massacre and the destruc-
tion of Black Wall Street as we do 
other race massacres that have oc-
curred during our history. And we must 
commit to understanding how systemic 
racism has shaped our Nation’s past 
and, sadly, its present. 
I am the first African-American Con-
gressman from the State of Nevada, so 
I feel uniquely honored to bring the 
voices of my community and my con-
stituents to the floor of this House. I 
am also proud that in my district and 
across the Silver State, Juneteenth 
celebrations have multiplied in recent 
years with the help of scholars and 
leaders, including Diane Pollard, who 
literally was one of my educators in 
high school; Al Gourrier, Sr.; Deborah 
Evans; and many other luminaries who 
have 
carried 
on 
the 
spirit 
of 
Juneteenth. 
This week, throughout my district, 
we are celebrating the 20th anniversary 
of the Las Vegas Juneteenth Festival, 
which supports educational program-
ming for underserved youth through 
the Rainbow Dreams Education Foun-
dation and the Rainbow Dreams Acad-
emy Charter School. 
I also want to recognize the Save Our 
Sons Juneteenth Festival, which brings 
our community together to celebrate 
Juneteenth and to support mentoring 
for underserved youth. 
You see, Madam Speaker, Juneteenth 
isn’t just about what happened in the 
past. It is what is continuing to happen 
right now, today, in the present. 
As Juneteenth celebrations grow, so 
does 
our 
collective 
understanding 
about the vibrant Black culture and 
history that have shaped our Nation 
since its founding. 
So let us embrace Juneteenth 2021 as 
a day of truth. Let us remember the 
joys and sorrows of our history. And let 
us build from them toward a more per-
fect Union, with true liberty, true jus-
tice, and true equality for all. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the anchor 
for yielding, and I thank my colleagues 
for coming to the floor to bring com-
memoration for Juneteenth 2021. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. May I ask the 
Speaker the time remaining, please. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 22 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is my privilege to yield to a gen-
tleman with a storied and layered his-
tory entrenched in one of the States 
that suffered the extension of slavery 
and faces its challenges today, of which 
this gentleman has been in the mix and 
in the gap of fighting for justice. We 
are excited about his presence here. I 
am so honored and privileged that he 
has chosen, with all of the work he has 
to do because he was elected in a spe-
cial election, this moment in history to 
present his first speech on the floor of 
the House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the State of Louisiana 
(Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman 
so much for her incredible leadership 
on this issue and so many others. We 
appreciate all that she does, and we ap-
preciate her steadfast and steady hand 
of guidance and leadership for the peo-
ple of America. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the opportunity to address this body. 
On Freedom’s Eve, January 1, 1863, 
enslaved and free African Americans 
gathered across the country, awaiting 
news that the Emancipation Proclama-
tion had taken effect. When the clock 
struck midnight, their prayers were 
answered, as it was declared that all 
enslaved people in Confederate States 
were legally free. 
While the 13th Amendment did end 
slavery under the law, not all who were 
enslaved were immediately freed. It 
took more than 2 years for the freedom 
to reach everyone when the Union 
troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, 
to announce that more than 250,000 
people within the State were free. 
It was this day, June 19, 1865, that we 
mark as the true day of freedom from 
the tyranny and oppression of slavery 
and the first steps into the Reconstruc-
tion era. We now honor this day, June 
19, as Juneteenth. 
While Juneteenth is a historic day 
that has been widely known and cele-
brated by African Americans for over a 
century, it is clear that many Ameri-
cans still are unaware of the signifi-
cance of this historic date. In the wake 
of the demonstrations that took place 
last summer, many Americans were 
faced with the uncomfortable truth re-
garding our country’s fraught racial 
history. 
The word ‘‘Juneteenth’’ entered our 
Nation’s lexicon at a time when Ameri-
cans were left to reconcile their daily 
lives with our daily struggles. It was a 
time set aside for reflection, for learn-
ing, for mourning, and for upheaval. 
Juneteenth marks the day that we as a 
nation were truly able to end the insid-
ious practice of slavery and begin to 
move forward to a better world. It also 
marks that our country still struggles 
and must live up to its promise. 
Representative John Lewis was an 
American icon, a civil rights leader, 
and one of my personal heroes. In this 
Congress, we prepare to hear a bill in 
his name that expands voting rights, 
the very thing he was asked for as he 
crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge dec-
ades ago. 
In 2021, we continue to speak out and 
fight against systemic racism as its 
vestiges of voter suppression, redlining, 
gerrymandering, and other Jim Crow 
relics still erode our democracy today. 
What makes America great is our di-
versity. It is our ability to see and un-
derstand issues from the many dif-
ferent perspectives that encompass our 
populace. While America has broken 
some promises in the past, we, America 
collectively, have the ability and the 
potential to rectify our past wrongs. 
We strive to improve; we work to grow; 
and we push to remediate our problems 
and make them better. 
As of today, 47 States have declared 
Juneteenth a State holiday. My native 
State of Louisiana recently signed into 
law that Louisiana will now recognize 
Juneteenth as a State holiday. I am 
very proud of that measure, and I am 
very proud of our Governor, John Bel 
Edwards, for signing that measure into 
law. I am very proud of the legislators 
who fought to bring it forward. 
I am grateful for the steps that we 
have taken to recognize the history be-
hind Juneteenth and to honor its leg-
acy. That is why I believe that 
Juneteenth should be a federally ob-
served holiday. This is America, and 
despite all of our many challenges, 
America continues to be the world’s 
greatest nation. 
For this reason, I am optimistic 
about our future and optimistic about 
our corrections. Together, 
we 
can 
make our world a better place and up-
hold the promise of freedom and justice 
for all. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me congratulate the gentleman for 
the new law in Louisiana and for his 
leadership and his powerful message on 
this floor on the freedom, really, of all 
people. My freedom is your freedom, 
your freedom is my freedom, and our 
freedom is America’s freedom. 
Let me express my appreciation to 
my co-anchor, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES). I thank him for his 
leadership. Let me be very clear that 
both his history and his State as well 
have a vested history in liberty and 
freedom, but, yes, no place did escape 
the vestiges of slavery. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman JACK-
SON LEE for her leadership. 
In order to understand where we 
stand in the present, we have to under-
stand where we have been and how we 
came to arrive at a society as racially 
divided and as unequal as our own. For 
me, it is a scandal that most Ameri-
cans have never heard of Juneteenth 
and most Americans have never heard 
of the Tulsa race massacre because 
these events are rarely, if ever, taught 
in public education. 
Juneteenth is not only not taught in 
our public schools, but there is not 
even a national holiday celebrating an 
event that has profound meaning to 
Black Americans, to all Americans. So 
I want to commend the gentlewoman’s 
leadership in advancing a bill that 
would establish Juneteenth as a na-
tional holiday. 
Frederick Douglass famously posed 
the question: What to a slave is July 
Fourth? 
Juneteenth is to Black America what 
July Fourth has exclusively been to

June 14, 2021 
White 
America: 
Independence 
Day. 
Juneteenth refers to the moment when 
slaves in Texas came to discover their 
legal freedom under the Emancipation 
Proclamation. Out of that discovery 
came 
a 
156-year 
tradition 
of 
Juneteenth celebration. It refers to the 
moment when Major General Gordon 
Granger led a Union Army to Texas to 
enforce the Emancipation Proclama-
tion 21⁄2 years after its issuance. 
The announcement was known as 
General Order Number 3, and it read as 
follows: ‘‘The people of Texas are in-
formed that, in accordance with a proc-
lamation from the Executive of the 
United States, all slaves are free. This 
involves an absolute equality of per-
sonal rights and rights of property be-
tween former masters and slaves, and 
the connection heretofore existing be-
tween them becomes that between em-
ployer and hired labor.’’ 
For me, Juneteenth contains a deep-
er lesson that we ignore at our own 
peril. Law becomes real not when it is 
proclaimed but when it is enforced. 
The emancipation of enslaved people 
became real not when it was pro-
claimed by Abraham Lincoln but when 
it was enforced by the Union Army, 
most notably on Juneteenth. 
The 
desegregation 
of 
our 
public 
schools became real not when it was 
proclaimed by the Supreme Court in 
Brown v. Board of Education but when 
it was enforced most notably by Presi-
dent Eisenhower, who sent the Na-
tional Guard to Little Rock, Arkansas. 
Voting rights became real not when 
it was proclaimed by the 15th Amend-
ment but when it was enforced a cen-
tury later by the Voting Rights Act en-
forced by the process of preclearance, 
which has since been gutted by the Su-
preme Court but which we are seeking 
to restore with the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act. 
Reconstruction was doomed by a lack 
of Federal enforcement. In the begin-
ning, Reconstruction had early success. 
It saw the passage of the 13th Amend-
ment, which abolished slavery; the 14th 
Amendment, which provided for equal 
protection of the law and which prohib-
ited discrimination based on race; and 
the 15th Amendment, which provided 
for voting rights and which prohibited 
disenfranchisement based on race. 
During Reconstruction, scores of Af-
rican Americans began exercising their 
fundamental right to vote, and some 
African Americans began winning elec-
tive office. For a fleeting moment, 
there was an outburst of Black polit-
ical power in America. Then came a 
turning point in the 1876 Presidential 
election, whose outcome was decided 
by a congressional commission. 
Then-Presidential candidate Ruther-
ford B. Hayes cut a deal with white su-
premacists in the United States Con-
gress. He agreed to withdraw the Union 
Army from the former Confederate 
States in exchange for the Presidency. 
When the Union Army withdrew from 
the South, it left behind a vacuum that 
ultimately came to be filled by Jim 
Crow, a system of racial discrimina-
tion, racial segregation, and racial ter-
rorism. 
b 2030 
What followed the failure of Recon-
struction was the lost century. 
Madam Speaker, for me, the lesson of 
Juneteenth is that an activist Federal 
Government is an essential defender of 
human rights and civil rights. It is an 
essential defender of equality and dig-
nity and humanity for all Americans. 
We must learn from the lessons of his-
tory, and we must continue the work of 
Reconstruction that is long overdue. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I say to the gentleman from New York, 
it is an esteemed pleasure to be able to 
draw upon both his knowledge and 
scholarship—might 
I 
stand 
on 
his 
shoulders—an activist Federal Govern-
ment. 
For some reason, as we face these 
trials and tribulations of 2021, there is 
a hesitancy to realize that the Federal 
Government is, in simplistic terms, an 
umbrella on a rainy day. It is, in fact, 
the concrete barrier in the time of a 
storm. And that is why we are on the 
floor today. 
Let me acknowledge that an activist 
Federal Government, in the positive 
way, would be the government that 
would say that Italian history and 
Irish history, Latinx, Hispanic history, 
and Caribbean history, and African his-
tory, and the Pilgrim Pride history, 
and European history, and Asian-Pa-
cific history, and Southeast Asian-Pa-
cific, and any others that I have left 
out, is valuable to be heard by our chil-
dren’s ears. It is valuable to be taught. 
Then they would be able to under-
stand the gentleman’s entreat, his re-
quest, which is H.R. 1320, which is bi-
partisan, that declares Juneteenth a 
national Federal holiday. 
And to the wrong representation of 
right-wing radio, it doesn’t substitute 
any holiday. It adds it to the list of 
Federal holidays. It does not subtract 
any holiday; does not take any holiday 
away. Yet it acknowledges the impor-
tance of that day and, as well, it is led 
by Senators MARKEY and CORNYN, a Re-
publican and Democrat in the United 
States Senate, and it is a bipartisan 
bill in the House. 
Is there any reason not to move this 
bill along as quickly as possible? 
And if there is a basis for not under-
standing what freedom meant, look at 
this slave that was symbolic of the life 
that slave led; but that is the light of 
being beat. 
What about those who were beaten to 
death or burned to death? 
It is no shame for our children to be 
taught this history. I know no teacher 
who would stand in the classroom and 
condemn children. I know teachers who 
are loving, and will give understanding, 
and let a child come out and say, I 
want a better America. 
Isn’t that the kind of soldier and doc-
tor and lawyer and teacher we want to 
build up? Isn’t that the kind of citizen 
we want to grow? 
And then, if we want to make it real-
istic and home for our moment, as my 
colleagues have said, we spent 4 days in 
Tulsa, Greenwood, that was burned to 
the ground; 300 in an unmarked grave. 
This is what 1921 looked like; not 1865, 
not 1810, not 1799, not 1724, when slav-
ery was raging, if you will, 250 years. 
This is what it looked like in 1921; a 
black body burned on the streets of 
Greenwood. 
So when we talk about jubilee and 
freedom, we do it in a way that we can, 
as Americans, be free. And then I want 
to say that matches the Emancipation 
Trail that is now law in the State of 
Texas, that march from victory, when 
General Granger said you are free. It 
matches H.R. 40, which is a non-offen-
sive repair and reconciliation that 
speaks to the language that Justice 
Hughes said about Black Americans, 
the discrete and insular minority ex-
cluded from those political processes 
ordinarily to be relied upon to protect 
them. All throughout tenure here there 
were denials of our freedom. 
And then, of course, Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., talked about an insuffi-
cient check; not of money, but he 
talked about that we have never been 
given justice and equality. 
So when we speak of the Emanci-
pation Trail, only the second com-
memoration of the history of African 
Americans 250 years in bondage, when 
we speak of Juneteenth, it is for all to 
celebrate, when General Granger land-
ed on the shores of Galveston. 
We will be in Galveston celebrating. 
We will see Naomi Carrier. We will see 
Eileen 
Lawal 
and 
Jackie 
Bostic, 
Ramon Manning and, of course, the 
Emancipation Conservatory. We will 
get to see Opal Lee, almost 100 years 
old, fighting for this holiday, or Al 
Edwards. We will get to see Senator 
CORNYN, a Republican who joins us in 
this commemoration, and all others. 
We will get to see the Nation be able to 
understand in its finality that it must 
be clear, it must be our birthright. 
It 
is 
a 
reminder, 
this 
day, 
on 
Juneteenth, that liberty and freedom 
are precious birthrights of all Ameri-
cans, which must be jealously guarded 
and preserved for future generations. 
That is why we are on the floor 
today. We are not in anger. We are not 
in anguish. We are here, in fact, for lib-
eration, freedom, and the empower-
ment of all Americans. 
Let stories be told, no matter who 
you are. And let the story be told of 
those 
uniquely 
held 
in 
bondage, 
through H.R. 40, the Commission to 
Study and Develop Reparation Pro-
posals, which we seek to put on the 
floor in this great month. And, of 
course, 
the 
national 
holiday 
of 
Juneteenth, along with the historic 
gift that we give to America, the 
Emancipation Trail, that all the world 
will be able to come. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
thank my chair, the Honorable JOYCE 
BEATTY, for her leadership in the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. And because

of freedom, it is a wonderment to stand 
here, free, with my colleague from New 
York, my co-chair, the Honorable Con-
gressman TORRES, and all others. 
Isn’t it precious? 
In God we trust that we stand here in 
freedom. Let us not ever lose it, and let 
us fight for it and let us keep it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to anchor the Congressional Black Caucus’s 
Special Order tonight on Juneteenth Inde-
pendence Day. 
I am pleased to be joined by Congress-
woman BEATTY, the Chair of the CBC; Con-
gressman TORRES of New York, the co-anchor 
for this Special Order, and so many of our 
CBC colleagues to commemorate a historically 
significant day for all Americans, but especially 
African Americans. 
Let me extend on behalf of the CBC its 
heartfelt thanks to the House leadership, par-
ticularly Majority Leader HOYER, for their sup-
port which paved the way for the House last 
year to pass by unanimous consent H. Res. 
1001, the resolution I introduced recognizing 
Juneteenth Independence Day. 
Madam Speaker, Juneteenth is as signifi-
cant to African Americans as July 4 is to all 
Americans because on that day, June 19, 155 
years ago, General Gordon Granger, the 
Commanding Officer of the District of Texas, 
rode into Galveston, Texas and announced 
the freedom of the last American slaves; belat-
edly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly 
two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln 
signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
When General Granger read these words of 
General Order No. 3 set off joyous celebra-
tions of the freedmen and woman of Texas: 
‘‘The people of Texas are informed that in 
accordance with a Proclamation from the Ex-
ecutive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
rights and rights of property between former 
masters and slaves, and the connection there-
fore existing between them becomes that be-
tween employer and hired laborer.’’ 
Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas 
state capital in 1867 under the direction of the 
Freedmen’s Bureau. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of slavery’s demise, commemorating 
freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices 
and contributions made by courageous African 
Americans towards making our great nation 
the more conscious and accepting country that 
it has become. 
As the nation prepares to celebrate July 4th, 
our national day of independence, it is a time 
to reflect on the accomplishments of our na-
tion and its people. 
I want to thank the Members of the House 
for their bipartisan support of this annual 
Juneteenth Resolution, which has 214 cospon-
sors, of which 202 are original sponsors. 
General Granger’s reading of General Order 
No. 3 ended chattel slavery, a form of per-
petual servitude that held generations of Afri-
cans in bondage in the United States for two- 
hundred and fortyeight years and opened a 
new chapter in American history. 
Recognizing the importance of this date, 
former slaves coined the word ‘‘Juneteenth’’ to 
mark the occasion with a celebration the first 
of which occurred in the Texas state capital in 
1867 under the direction of the Freedmen’s 
Bureau. 
Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of 
freedom for people who did not have it. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of slavery’s demise. 
It commemorates freedom while acknowl-
edging the sacrifices and contributions made 
by courageous African Americans towards 
making our great nation the more conscious 
and accepting country that it has become. 
The celebration of Juneteenth followed the 
most devastating conflict in our country’s his-
tory, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted 
brother against brother, neighbor against 
neighbor and threatened to tear the fabric of 
our union apart forever that America truly be-
came the land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once 
said, ‘‘Freedom is never free,’’ and African 
American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph 
often said ‘‘Freedom is never given. It is won.’’ 
Truer words were never spoken. 
We should all recognize the power and the 
ironic truth of those statements, and we 
should pause to remember the enormous 
price paid by all Americans in our country’s 
quest to realize its promise. 
Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years 
of suffering African Americans endured under 
slavery and celebrates the legacy of persever-
ance that has become the hallmark of the Afri-
can American experience in the struggle for 
equality. 
But Madam Speaker, as the poet Langston 
Hughes reminds us in his famous poem, 
’’Mother to Son,’’ life in America for African 
Americans ‘‘ain’t been no crystal stair.’’ 
The post-bellum period in America was 
marked by violence and terrorism against Afri-
can Americans as they sought to make real 
the promises of the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the Constitution. 
Nowhere was the reign of terror to which 
they were subjected to more horrific than the 
1921 Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre, which 
occurred a century ago this past May 31–June 
1. 
Tulsa’s Greenwood District, was known as 
‘‘Black Wall Street,’’ and was the most pros-
perous African American community in the 
United States. 
The Greenwood community with a popu-
lation of over 10,000 Black people had stores 
that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 gro-
cery stores, a hospital, a savings and loan 
bank, a post office, three hotels, jewelry and 
clothing stores, two movie theaters, a library, 
pool halls, a bus and cab service, a nationally 
recognized school system, six private air-
planes, and two black newspapers. 
But on May 31st of that year, the 35 city 
blocks of Greenwood went up in flames, at 
least 300 Black persons were murdered and 
more than 800 were injured; it is estimated 
that not less than 9,000 were left homeless 
and destitute. 
The message of the Tulsa Race Massacre 
was clear to Black America: ‘‘Stay in your 
place. Do not attempt to accumulate and be-
queath wealth or own property. Remember 
your history in America is as chattel property.’’ 
Madam Speaker, were they still alive, the 
domestic terrorists of the mob in Greenwood 
would see their evil reenacted—and then fol-
lowed by a similar attempt to cover-up it and 
foster collective amnesia—a century later in 
the siege and desecration of the hallowed 
halls of the U.S. Capitol, the ’Citadel of De-
mocracy’. 
It should not be overlooked that the source 
of the January 6 white mob’s irrational anger, 
hatred, and violent reaction was that Black 
Americans voted in overwhelming numbers in 
Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and 
other enclaves to oust the most proWhite su-
premacy President since the Civil War. 
Some might ask ‘‘Why dwell on the past? 
Let us forget unpleasant things and move on 
into the future.’’ 
My answer is to quote the great southern 
writer William Faulkner: ‘‘The past is never 
dead. It is not even the past.’’ 
The hatreds, prejudices, resentments, and 
white supremacy that Black Americans wit-
nessed and suffered in Greenwood a century 
ago are not dead; they are not even past. 
So my message to the descendants of the 
survivors and victims of slavery, America’s 
Original Sin, is to keep fighting for justice, to 
never be silent, to affirm the truth, and seek 
accountability. 
In his famous Second Inaugural Address, 
President Lincoln spoke of the profound moral 
debt owed for ‘‘all the wealth piled by the 
bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of un-
requited toil,’’ and that the Civil War was the 
judgment of the Lord, which was ‘‘true and 
righteous altogether.’’ 
That debt remains to be paid, which is why 
African Americans have always peacefully pe-
titioned the government for the redress of its 
grievances. 
As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King said at 
the 1963 March on Washington: 
‘‘In a sense, we have come to our nation’s 
capital to cash a check. When the architects 
of our republic wrote the magnificent words of 
the Constitution and the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, they were signing a promissory 
note to which every American was to fall heir. 
‘‘This note was a promise that all men, yes, 
black men as well as white men, would be 
guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
‘‘It is obvious today that America has de-
faulted on this promissory note insofar as her 
citizens of color are concerned. Instead of 
honoring this sacred obligation, America has 
given the Negro people a bad check, a check 
which has come back marked ‘insufficient 
funds.’ But we refuse to believe that the bank 
of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe 
that there are insufficient funds in the great 
vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we 
have come to cash this check—a check that 
will give us upon demand the riches of free-
dom and the security of justice.’’ 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 40, legislation I have 
introduced, continues this proud legacy of de-
manding reparative justice and accountability 
for injuries inflicted. 
H.R. 40, which establishes a national com-
mission to examine slavery and discrimination 
in the colonies and the United States from 
1619 to the present and recommend appro-
priate remedies. 
Among other requirements, the commission 
shall identify (1) the role of federal and state 
governments in supporting the institution of 
slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the pub-
lic and private sectors against freed slaves 
and their descendants; and (3) lingering nega-
tive effects of slavery on living African-Ameri-
cans and society. 
The goal of the historical investigations H.R. 
40 mandates is to bring American society to a 
new reckoning with how our past affects the

current conditions of African Americans and to 
make America a better place by helping the 
truly disadvantaged. 
Consequently, the reparations movement 
does not focus on payments to individuals, but 
to remedies that can be created in as many 
forms necessary to equitably address the 
many kinds of injuries sustained from chattel 
slavery and its continuing vestiges. 
To merely focus on finance is an empty 
gesture and betrays a lack of understanding of 
the depth of the unaddressed moral issues 
that continue to haunt this nation. 
While it might be convenient to assume that 
we can address the current divisive racial and 
political climate in our nation through race 
neutral means, experience shows that we 
have not escaped our history. 
Though the Civil Rights Movement chal-
lenged many of the most racist practices and 
structures that subjugated the African Amer-
ican community, it was not followed by a com-
mitment to truth and reconciliation. 
For that reason, the legacy of racial inequal-
ity has persisted, and left the nation vulnerable 
to a range of problems that continue to yield 
division, racial disparities, and injustice. 
By passing H.R. 40, Congress can start a 
movement toward the national reckoning we 
need to bridge racial divides. 
Reparations are ultimately about respect 
and reconciliation—and the hope that one day, 
all Americans can walk together toward a 
more just future. 
Official slavery ended with the Civil War and 
ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. 
But unofficial slavery was continued with the 
new institution of share-crop farming, a crimi-
nal justice system that would press convicts 
into work once done by slaves, and labor poli-
cies that dictated income for work done based 
upon skin color. 
And, of course, all of this was reinforced by 
the systematic disenfranchisement of black 
Americans, the ‘‘discrete and insular minority’’ 
excluded from ‘‘those political processes ordi-
narily to be relied upon to protect’’ them, to 
quote Chief Justice Hughes’ famous Footnote 
4 in United States v. Carolene Products Com-
pany, 304 U.S. 144 (1938). 
These are just some of the many reasons 
that the history of the United States is inter-
twined with the history of enslaved Africans in 
the Americas. 
‘‘There is blood and there are tears, but 
there is also redemption and reconciliation. 
But to get there, we must have the complete 
truth and lay our history bare. It is the light 
that sheds the way to the more perfect union 
all Americans want. 
‘‘The Commission created and empowered 
by H.R. 40 is a necessary first step in that ef-
fort to get to truth and reconciliation about the 
’Original Sin of American Slavery’ that is nec-
essary to light the way to the beloved commu-
nity we all seek.’’ 
So, Madam Speaker, this is where we are. 
In recent years, a number of National 
Juneteenth Organizations have arisen to take 
their place alongside older organizations—all 
with the mission to promote and cultivate 
knowledge and appreciation of African Amer-
ican history and culture. 
Juneteenth celebrates African American 
freedom while encouraging self-development 
and respect for all cultures . 
But it must always remain a reminder to us 
all that liberty and freedom are precious birth-
rights of all Americans, which must be jeal-
ously guarded and preserved for future gen-
erations.

THE
BIPARTISAN 
JUNETEENTH NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE DAY 
ACT—CURRENTLY HAS 159 SPONSORS IN THE 
HOUSE 
As the Chair of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism 
and Homeland Security, I am committed to 
affording members of this committee to un-
cover the facts and shine light into darkness 
to reveal the threats posed by ‘The Rise of 
Domestic Terrorism in America.’ On Janu-
ary 6, 2021, the nation and the world wit-
nessed the damage caused by divisions acer-
bated by lies and hate.’’ 
WASHINGTON, DC—‘‘Today I re-introduced 
in the House of Representatives the bipar-
tisan Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act, H.R. 1320, with 102 co-sponsors. The 
House re-introduction coincides with the re-
introduction of a Senate companion bill by 
Senators 
Markey, 
Smith, 
and 
Booker. 
Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, 
legislation 
when 
enacted 
would 
make 
Juneteenth a federal holiday. ‘‘Juneteenth,’’ 
is observed on June 19, and commemorates 
the end of slavery in the United States and 
is also known as ‘‘Emancipation Day,’’ ‘‘Ju-
bilee Day,’’ and ‘‘Juneteenth Independence 
Day.’’ 
‘‘On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, Texas, 
Major General Gordon Granger issued Gen-
eral Order No. 3, which announced that, in 
accordance with the Emancipation Procla-
mation, ‘‘all slaves are free. Juneteenth is 
currently recognized by 47 states and the 
District of Columbia as an official state holi-
day or observance. In 1980, Texas was the 
first state to recognize Juneteenth as a paid 
state holiday.’’ 
‘‘Juneteenth honors the end of the years of 
suffering that African Americans endured 
under slavery and celebrates the legacy of 
perseverance that has become the hallmark 
of the African American experience in the 
struggle for equality. These values are 
shared by millions of Americans who over 
generations have held fast to the promise of 
this nation while struggling fore basic 
human rights.’’ 
‘‘Juneteenth celebrates African American 
freedom while encouraging selfdevelopment 
and respect for all cultures. But it must al-
ways remain a reminder to us all that lib-
erty and freedom are the precious birthright 
of all Americans which must be jealously 
guarded and preserved for future genera-
tions. As it takes on a more national and 
even global perspective, the events of 1865 in 
Texas are not forgotten, for all our roots tie 
back to this fertile soil from which a na-
tional day of pride is growing. This is why we 
must establish the Juneteenth Independence 
Day, as a national holiday. And today we 
also pay special tribute to Opal Lee, the 
Grandmother of Juneteenth!’’

Juneteenth or the first legislation that established Juneteenth as a state 
holiday. It excludes legislation adopted by states after the initial observation 
year. For example, Kansas adopted multiple resolutions, such as S. Res. 
1866 (2007), S. Res. 1888 (2009), S. Res. 1865 (2011 ), and S. Res. 1754

HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES 
Numerous resources provide information 
on the history and culture of the holiday. 
Some of these include the following:

‘‘Juneteenth:

Other 
Independence Day.’’ This blog post includes 
pictures of Major General George Granger 
and the house from which he read General 
Order Number 3. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
for over 150 years, June 19th, commonly 
known as ‘‘Juneteenth Independence Day,’’ 
has been celebrated as a source of inspiration 
and encouragement for generations of African 
Americans in Texas and across the nation. 
News of the end of slavery did not reach the 
frontiers of the United States until months after 
the conclusion of the Civil War, and more than 
two and a half years after President Abraham 
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation 
on January 1, 1863. It was not until June 19, 
1865 that Union soldiers, led by Major General 
Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston, Texas 
with news of freedom for the enslaved. 
The 
Roman 
philosopher 
Cicero 
once 
quoted, ‘‘history is the witness that testifies to 
the passing of time; it illumines reality, vital-
izes memory, provides guidance in daily life 
and brings us tidings of antiquity.’’ In honor of 
the spirit, of the trials and tribulations of our 
ancestors, and the legacy they have left, we 
must never forget our history. And we can do 
that by joining together to observe Juneteenth 
and celebrate the progress we have made 
thereafter, while also recognizing and reaffirm-
ing our commitment to the work that remains. 
We can do this by remembering who we are, 
where we came from, and rejoicing now in the 
freedom and liberties that we share—and by 
never taking them for granted. 
f 
FAILURE OF THE ENDANGERED 
SPECIES ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
before I begin, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous materials on the topic of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
nearly 50 years ago, President Nixon 
signed the Endangered Species Act into 
law, which was designed to do two 
things: Number 1, prevent species from 
going extinct; and Number 2, promote 
their recovery back to health and 
healthy populations. 
Since then, hundreds of plants and 
animals have joined the endangered or 
threatened species list, spurring con-
servation and recovery efforts at all 
levels of government. 
While this landmark species protec-
tion law is well-intentioned and has ac-
complished many good things, it has 
become an endless source of conflict 
and, unfortunately, many rightly con-
sider it a dismal failure. 
The Endangered Species Act hasn’t 
seen meaningful reform since 1973. And 
since then, less than 3 percent of spe-
cies have recovered and been delisted. 
The Congressional Western Caucus 
has long advocated for improvements 
to modernize the ESA and make it 
more effective for our species and more 
transparent for the American people. 
My colleagues in the caucus have advo-
cated on behalf of the rural commu-
nities that we represent who are se-
verely impacted by the ESA listing de-
cisions and who, in many cases, are 
working in collaboration with private 
landowners, community groups, Tribes, 
and local governments to promote suc-
cessful species recovery and land con-
servation. 
And we have advocated to adminis-
tration after administration the need 
to follow the science and fulfill the 
congressional intent of the law, which 
is to promote recovery of these species 
and then remove them from the endan-
gered species list. 
That is why I am so proud to host 
this Special Order tonight, where you 
will hear from several of my Western 
Caucus colleagues about successful, lo-
cally led recovery efforts taking place 
across the country; the different im-
pacts that ESA listing decisions have 
had on local communities and econo-
mies; and some of the legislative re-
forms needed to finally bring the ESA 
into the 21st century. 
Over the past few years, the Trump 
administration made great progress by 
finalizing several updates to the ESA 
to modernize this bedrock law and to 
improve our ability to protect endan-
gered and threatened species and cele-
brate our recovery successes. 
The Trump administration created a 
transparent process for designating 
critical habitat for listed species, and 
finalized a commonsense definition 
that a critical habitat must indeed be 
critical to the species at hand. 
Who would have thought? 
They streamlined and modernized the 
process for consultation between gov-
ernment agencies to determine the 
scope of listing impacts, including re-
quiring the consideration of the eco-
nomic impact a listing could have on 
local economics. 
Lastly, they finalized a rule that re-
wards State and landowners for suc-
cessful recovery actions by loosening 
mandated regulations on species man-
agement as the species begin to recover 
and are down-listed from endangered to 
threatened. 
Unfortunately, earlier this month, 
the Biden administration announced 
plans to rescind or reverse these im-
provements. This is exactly the wrong 
direction we should be heading, Madam 
Speaker. 
As we have seen over the past four 
decades, the ESA has become a weapon 
used by extreme environmentalists and 
serial litigators to slow or halt critical 
economic development and land man-
agement projects in rural communities 
throughout the United States. From 
preventing the restoration of our for-
ests, to creating overburdensome road-
blocks for domestic energy develop-
ment, the ESA, in its current form, 
simply does more harm than good. 
Oftentimes, these ESA regulations 
negatively impact the very people we 
need as conservation partners. Through 
land use restrictions, reduced property 
values, and costly permitting require-
ments, unilateral and far-sweeping list-
ing decisions remove incentive for 
these local partners to come to the 
table. In effect, it makes enemies out 
of the people who are most critical to 
our efforts instead of treating these 
species like the assets they are to our 
local lands. We must empower our 
local, State, and Tribal partners to col-
laborate on comprehensive recovery 
and conservation efforts, and we know 
this to be true. 
More stringent regulations will not 
lead to more successful species recov-
ery. In rural America, we value the re-
sponsible management of plants, ani-
mals, and native species, but we have 
to do so in a way that doesn’t destroy 
our economies, decimate our lands or 
leave our communities vulnerable to 
natural disasters. 
We need flexible tools, not one-size- 
fits-all regulations from the Federal

Government to be successful in our 
shared goal of recovery of our Nation’s 
endangered and threatened species. 
Tonight, we are here to raise the 
voices of rural communities that are 
impacted by the ESA and to make our 
message heard. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my good 
friend from the great State of Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER), who is the rank-
ing member of the Subcommittee on 
Energy and Mineral Resources for the 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise with my colleagues in the Congres-
sional Western Caucus to discuss abuse 
of the Endangered Species Act, a law 
passed 
with 
good 
intentions, 
but 
weaponized by radicals to fight hunt-
ing, fishing, mining, logging, transpor-
tation, and our way of life. 
In my district in northern Min-
nesota, the dramatic rise of the gray 
wolf has posed a threat to our deer 
herds, our livestock, and our family 
pets. The Minnesota Deer Hunters As-
sociation considers it a top threat to 
our hunting way of life. 
Meanwhile, it wreaks havoc on our 
cattle ranchers throughout northern 
Minnesota. One rancher lost 26 cows to 
wolves in just 1 year. 
In 2013, then-President Obama’s Fish 
and Wildlife Service rightfully delisted 
the gray wolf. 
b 2045 
Why? Because the gray wolf had 
clearly recovered. It had exceeded pop-
ulation targets by as much as 300 per-
cent. And, no, this is not a statistic 
from hunters or ranchers. This is 
straight out of a 2013 Fish and Wildlife 
Service press release. 
Dan Ashe, Obama’s Fish and Wildlife 
Service then-Director, when the gray 
wolf was delisted, stated: ‘‘An exhaus-
tive review of the latest scientific in-
formation . . . shows that we have ac-
complished that goal with the gray 
wolf.’’ 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what 
happened 
next? Activist judges in Washington, 
D.C., put the gray wolf back on the list 
just a couple of years later. 
And when Obama’s Fish and Wildlife 
Service Director took a well-paying job 
with an activist group, his tune sud-
denly changed, and he wanted the gray 
wolf back on the endangered species 
list. 
Fortunately, the Trump administra-
tion did the right thing, listening to 
the science, and delisted the gray wolf 
last fall. 
However, the same problem with the 
ESA and activist groups remain, and it 
is widespread. 
Recently, the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice declined to list the moose as an en-
dangered species because their num-
bers are above targets. This time, the 
radical activist lawyers said the quiet 
part out loud. In a Minneapolis Star 
Tribune article, the Center for Biologi-
cal Diversity, which has significant in-
fluence over House Democrats, stated: 
‘‘Now it is going to be a lot harder to 
ensure that things like mines . . . 
don’t go forward without protections 
for moose in place.’’ 
Could their intentions be any more 
clearer, Madam Speaker? 
The purpose of the ESA is pretty 
straightforward: to protect endangered 
species. Tragically, the ESA is not al-
ways being used for conservation. It is 
being weaponized as a way to advance 
the far left’s radical agenda. It is being 
used by the Green New Deal Democrat 
Party to stop progress. 
We need to update the Endangered 
Species Act to allow us to hunt, fish, 
mine, harvest timber, farm, and for 
other responsible uses. Let’s reform the 
Endangered Species Act and maintain 
our way of life. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. STAUBER and appreciate him 
bringing his perspective from the great 
State of Minnesota. 
Like he and his constituents, we in 
the State of Washington also under-
stand the impact of the gray wolf and 
what impact it can have on our local 
ranchers, farmers, and communities. I 
thank him very much for his work on 
bringing control back to the State, 
where it should be. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN), who is the Republican 
ranking member on the Committee on 
Natural Resources. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Wash-
ington not only for holding this impor-
tant forum tonight but also for his tre-
mendous leadership with the Western 
Caucus, where we look at real solutions 
for rural America. 
Madam Speaker, America is blessed 
with an incredible abundance of wild-
life. Many of these animals have be-
come icons of our country. Look no 
further than the majestic bald eagle, 
the national symbol of freedom and 
American pride. 
With such rich biodiversity, we have 
a responsibility to respect and protect 
the species that call the United States 
home. When President Nixon signed 
the Endangered Species Act into law in 
1973, its stated intent was simple: pro-
tect wildlife most at risk of extinction. 
While the law had just intentions, 
ambiguous language and lawsuits have 
allowed special interest groups to hi-
jack the ESA, using it as a weapon 
against any projects or actions they 
oppose. This has had a particularly 
devastating impact on rural economies 
across the country as red-tape lawsuits 
block important projects and essential 
agency actions. 
One example of this, as my col-
leagues from California know, is con-
tinual ESA lawsuits over the 3-inch 
Delta smelt that have diverted trillions 
of gallons of water away from farmers 
in the San Joaquin Valley of California 
to create a man-made drought and dou-
ble-digit 
unemployment 
in 
recent 
years. 
Despite these diversions, the fish 
populations of the Delta smelt con-
tinue decreasing, and more farmers are 
throwing in the towel because of the 
uncertainty. 
We can find another example in the 
Pacific Northwest. The 1990 listing of 
the northern spotted owl economically 
devastated rural communities in Or-
egon and Washington by virtually deci-
mating the timber industry in the re-
gion. The collapse of the timber indus-
try has actually hurt the northern 
spotted owl by making these forests 
into dense, overgrown powder kegs. 
Now, decades later, Americans are pay-
ing higher prices for building materials 
because much of our mill infrastruc-
ture was wiped out, never to return. 
ESA litigation has also prevented 
delisting of animals that have fully re-
covered, like the grizzly bear. The 
Western States that house grizzly 
bears undertook a herculean effort to 
recover them, to the point that the 
Fish and Wildlife Service found that 
grizzly bears in the Greater Yellow-
stone Ecosystem and Northern Conti-
nental Divide Ecosystem are fully re-
covered. 
This is not a new issue, as they first 
moved to delist the Greater Yellow-
stone population back in 2007. However, 
due to ESA lawsuits from radical spe-
cial interest groups, both population 
segments are still listed. 
Unfortunately, examples like this 
now fill the endangered species list. 
This is diverting critical resources 
away from animals that actually need 
protection. 
This should be common sense. If an 
animal recovers and is thriving in its 
environment, it should be delisted, 
plain and simple. Yet, Democrat law-
makers and administration officials 
are so intent on pleasing the whims of 
special interest groups that they refuse 
to follow the science and to look at the 
facts. We must work together to close 
these loopholes. 
Earlier this month, the Biden admin-
istration announced it is rolling back 
significant ESA reforms. It is another 
example of how out of touch this ad-
ministration is with rural Americans 
and endangered species as well. Under 
these policies, rural America is now 
what is in the most danger. 
Many of the reforms put in place 
under President Trump were born out 
of input from local communities most 
affected by the policies created in 
Washington. Yet, this administration 
seems bent on reinstating burdensome 
regulations in order to open up the 
door for environmental groups to again 
weaponize the ESA. 
Republican or Democrat, we can all 
agree that we want our most vulner-
able species not just to survive but to 
thrive for generations. Using the ESA 
as a political battering ram will not ac-
complish this goal. 
We must return the ESA to its origi-
nal intent: protecting wildlife that is 
most at risk. Anything more than that 
is a bureaucratic overreach and a give-
away to radical environmental groups. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman again for hosting this forum.

June 14, 2021 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
really thank my friend for his leader-
ship on this very important issue. 
As was mentioned earlier, the ESA 
has a dismal recovery rate of just 3 per-
cent. 
We 
have 
to 
work 
hard 
to 
strengthen this law in order to provide 
real results. 
We ought to be incentivizing private 
investment 
in 
species 
recovery, 
streamline decision-making, and pro-
mote the comprehensive efforts of 
State and local governments as well as 
Tribes. 
I want to just say I greatly appre-
ciate the thoughts of the good gen-
tleman from the Committee on Natural 
Resources. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BAIRD), one 
of my fellow farmers in Congress and a 
war veteran. I thank him for being 
with us tonight. 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague from the State 
of Washington for allowing me to have 
the opportunity to participate in this 
Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of the communities and the resi-
dents of west central Indiana to share 
our experience with the Endangered 
Species Act. 
As an animal scientist and a farmer, 
I am a lifelong conservationist. I value 
the well-intentioned effort of the ESA 
to protect and conserve our Nation’s 
most iconic species that define our 
landscapes and have shaped our herit-
age. Instead, however, I have repeat-
edly found myself discouraged with the 
implementation of this important act. 
As I shared here on the House floor a 
few weeks ago, Lakes Freeman and 
Shafer, near Monticello, Indiana, have 
been a popular tourist destination. It 
has been home to many small busi-
nesses, attractions, and a vibrant local 
economy for generations of Hoosiers. 
Unfortunately, though, a series of 
droughts and a tangle of bureaucratic 
red tape involving the ESA has made a 
devastating impact on this community. 
Following a listing on the endan-
gered species list more than a decade 
ago of mussels found in the Tippecanoe 
River, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice subsequently ordered a new higher 
volume of water to consistently flow 
out of the Oakdale Dam that forms 
Lake Freeman, in an effort to preserve 
these now-protected mussels. This ex-
ecutive action by unelected bureau-
crats has crippled our once-thriving 
community. 
Businesses like the Tall Timbers Ma-
rina, local resorts, and the Madam Car-
roll cruise boat, as seen here, report 
catastrophic losses to revenue and de-
pleted financial reserves. 
Homeowners along the lake report 
ruined seawalls, dried-up wells, and 
slashed resale values, even during this 
hottest real estate market of our life-
time. 
With zero regard for the economic 
and environmental catastrophe cre-
ated, the Fish and Wildlife Service re-
fuses to negotiate and continues to en-
force a mandate designed to protect a 
population of mussels that have likely 
already died from the bacterial over-
load created when this 1,500-acre lake 
was reduced to a puddle, killing prac-
tically all the wildlife that used to call 
Lake Freeman home. 
Due to years of misinterpretation of 
the 
law, 
unchecked 
actions 
by 
unelected 
bureaucrats, 
and 
radical 
environmentalism, this once valuable 
law, designed to conserve America’s 
natural beauty, has instead proved 
time and time again to be a death knell 
to actual ecosystems and the nearby 
communities. 
The Service consistently hides be-
hind its ability to point fingers at 
other agencies, whose compliance is 
obligated by the ESA as a means to 
avoid rational management of the act 
and the species it protects. 
As 
thought 
leaders 
and 
policy-
makers, we have an important respon-
sibility to preserve the natural beauty 
that God has bestowed on our land. The 
Endangered Species Act was estab-
lished with that mission at heart but 
has gone frightfully astray. 
It has been 40 years since the enact-
ment of the ESA. Now more than ever, 
it is time to modernize this important 
law, to fix its broken parts to better 
serve its purpose and to allow for re-
sponsible solutions to disasters like 
Lake Freeman. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
this valuable effort. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. BAIRD and appreciate his 
leadership on this important issue. 
From farming to ranching to mining 
to forestry to recreational opportuni-
ties, the far-reaching impacts of the 
Endangered Species Act go wide. I 
thank him for bringing up those very 
important points. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN), my 
good friend and colleague from the 
town of Quinter. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Washington very 
much for his leadership with the West-
ern Caucus and for hosting this Special 
Order tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today, with 
my colleagues from the Western Cau-
cus, to highlight progress made in the 
lesser prairie chicken population re-
covery through voluntary conservation 
efforts in Kansas. 
The lesser prairie chicken is a North 
American species native to the grass-
lands and southern Great Plains across 
New 
Mexico, 
Colorado, 
Oklahoma, 
Texas, and Kansas. These birds use the 
open areas of the plains to perform 
their courtship dance and build their 
nests on the ground, away from any 
roads or structures. 
b 2100 
My district, the Big First of Kansas, 
is home to the most extensive range 
and largest population of the lesser 
prairie-chicken. 
Since the 1990s, there have been con-
cerns regarding the lesser prairie- 
chicken population size and habitat, 
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
has considered listing the bird under 
the Endangered Species Act on mul-
tiple occasions. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service cited 
habitat fragmentation as one of the 
reasons for its population decline, as 
much of the area is used for cropland, 
grazing, and oil and gas development. 
However, we have seen perhaps the 
most significant population changes 
tied 
to 
the 
prolonged 
periods 
of 
drought across the chicken’s range. 
At its lowest, the lesser prairie- 
chicken population fell to approxi-
mately 15,400 birds during the worst 
phase of the 2013 drought. 
As the population declined, stake-
holders across the five states began 
conversations and plans to address this 
issue and partnered with local land-
owners and industry. The Kansas De-
partment of Wildlife, Parks and Tour-
ism teamed up with farmers and ranch-
ers, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Inter-
state Working Group, and other mid-
western States throughout the bird’s 
range to initiate conservation plans. 
In their work to help the lesser prai-
rie-chicken, Kansans have conserved 
more than 40,000 acres of habitat 
through the Conservation Reserve Pro-
gram at the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture and private investments. Many 
of the voluntary conservation efforts 
have been directly funded by farmers 
and ranchers, the energy sector, and 
other 
landowners. 
As 
stakeholders 
make conservation changes, it is vital 
that the practices are mutually bene-
ficial to both the lesser prairie-chicken 
and agriculture and energy producers. 
These voluntary efforts have yielded 
excellent results, with the lesser prai-
rie-chicken population up to more than 
34,400 birds in 2020. In Kansas, the popu-
lation has been stable to increasing 
since 2013, while the entire population 
has been increasing since 2016. The pop-
ulation growth has occurred thanks to 
voluntary efforts, but also because of 
increased rainfall, which has also bene-
fited many of the agricultural pro-
ducers in the area. 
And so it is especially alarming and 
disappointing to see the Fish and Wild-
life Service release a plan to list the 
lesser prairie-chicken under the Endan-
gered Species Act as threatened in the 
northern population and endangered in 
the southern population. 
The potential ESA listing flies in the 
face of years spent and millions in-
vested in voluntary conservation and 
goes against the clear data that the 
population has increased under those 
efforts. As usual, President Biden be-
lieves Federal overreach is the answer 
to a local and State issue, and his ad-
ministration lacks trust in private 
landowners to take care of their own 
land. 
I strongly and vehemently oppose the 
listing of the lesser prairie-chicken, 
and I will continue to push back on the

Biden administration’s egregious over-
reach. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate very much Mr. MANN’s par-
ticipation in this Special Order but 
also his leadership on this very impor-
tant issue. He gives clear examples in 
his own district of seeing the success in 
the recovery of, in his case, the lesser 
prairie-chicken through, I think I 
heard him say, voluntary conservation 
efforts. 
It just underscores the need for us to 
be able to recognize all of the efforts 
that are being taken on these species’ 
behalf, 
utilize 
the 
best 
available 
science, and consider all efforts that 
are being made when assessing these 
listing decisions. 
I thank Mr. MANN, and I appreciate 
very much his contribution. 
Now, I would like to yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
TENNEY), a prospective member of the 
Western Caucus, one that we would be 
delighted to have her membership, but 
certainly appreciate very much her 
participation this evening to help us il-
lustrate this very important issue to 
the American public. We are anxious to 
have her here this evening. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I join 
my colleagues today urging common-
sense policies to carry out the goals of 
the Endangered Species Act while al-
lowing our communities to flourish. 
As stewards of our planet, we each 
have a responsibility to care for the en-
vironment and protect our wildlife 
while also caring for and addressing 
the needs of our human environment, 
which often gets left out in this con-
versation. 
However, today it seems more dif-
ficult than ever to have balanced dis-
cussions. Deeply entrenched special in-
terests are increasingly using our 
small communities as pawns for their 
larger political ambitions. Unfortu-
nately, the bureaucrats in both the 
Federal and State Government, espe-
cially in New York, have become more 
powerful than the people, and that is 
unacceptable. 
I want to bring to your attention 
what is happening in my community 
today. I represent New York’s 22nd Dis-
trict, which stretches all the way from 
Lake Ontario, yes, a Great Lake, to the 
Pennsylvania border in the heart of 
beautiful, pastoral, upstate New York. 
On April 16, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers and New York State Depart-
ment of Environmental Conservation 
ordered an immediate halting of a rou-
tine annual dredging project to clear 
ingress and egress into the lovely inlet 
of Sandy Pond, which is on the eastern 
shore of Lake Ontario, due to the 
sighting of a piping plover, a small 
shoreline bird that weighs less than 2 
ounces. Even though there are over 
10,000 of these birds today throughout 
the Great Plains and eastern seaboard, 
they remain listed as an endangered 
species in the Great Lakes region. 
The annual dredging project main-
tains safe ingress and egress into 
Sandy Pond. The seasonal dredging was 
one week from completion before the 
forced government closure. There are 
several hundred homes and campsites 
along this beautiful spot on Lake On-
tario known as Sandy Pond, where peo-
ple from around the Northeast have en-
joyed this incredibly beautiful and 
unique place for over a century. 
The closure has been devastating to 
local businesses, residents, and visi-
tors, who have already been suffering 
from the disruptions of the COVID–19 
pandemic last summer. Property val-
ues alone in this region are in excess of 
$150 million, not including all the busi-
ness revenues and sales tax lost from 
people coming to this region from real-
ly all around the Northeast and Can-
ada. 
Despite this harsh Federal action, 
the two—there are now two—piping 
plovers’ nests are not even close to the 
dredging site. I know because I went to 
the site, and I walked off the distance 
from the dredging site to the beginning 
of the designated habitat. The distance 
was clearly over 3,000 feet, just to get 
to the beginning of the site, where the 
birds are much farther down. 
I want to emphasize that the commu-
nity cares deeply about the natural en-
vironment. They seek to preserve this 
natural environment and its natural 
splendor for generations to come, and 
they deeply care about the continued 
growth and continued population of 
this piping plover. 
The community has proposed a sim-
ple dredging, an economy-mode dredg-
ing, which would be less intrusive, to 
dispose of the sand in an alternative lo-
cation that would be far away. This is 
a very modest and safe proposal. It is 
respectful and preserves the nesting 
site to the bird, and it is a perfectly 
reasonable accommodation. 
Unfortunately, the Federal and State 
bureaucrats have dug in and refuse to 
compromise, despite the fact that 
dredging can begin again safely and re-
sponsibly without threatening the life 
or the habitat of the birds. 
The Federal and State agencies have 
been unable to support their position 
yet with data or facts. We have had nu-
merous conversations with them, pub-
lic meetings, and press conferences, 
and they refuse to offer any oppor-
tunity for the residents to have some 
relief. 
All the while, the community at 
Sandy Pond continues to suffer, and 
the harm could be irreparable harm as 
the situation grows more dire each 
day, as the safe passage into Sandy 
Pond to and from Lake Ontario be-
comes impossible. 
The piping plover, interestingly, has 
not been seen in this part of Sandy 
Pond. Really it is sort of a rare resi-
dent. And it has been determined that 
actually piping plovers like dredged 
sand. It unearths minerals and nutri-
ents for them, and they tend to be 
flocking now to these nesting sites. 
Sadly, a few years ago one of the pairs 
that did show up was killed by a fox, so 
we were unable to save that particular 
pair. 
There are far too many communities 
that have suffered from the whims of 
bureaucrats in Washington and Albany 
who just don’t seem to care and seem 
to be hiding behind many of these rules 
and regulations when there are reason-
able alternatives that will preserve the 
natural environment as well as the 
human environment. 
I am concerned that to make matters 
worse the Biden administration is bar-
reling down a path of appeasement to 
the left lobbyists and special interests. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
has already announced they are repeal-
ing recent reforms to the Endangered 
Species Act put in place under the last 
administration—and thank you for ac-
knowledging the changes that were 
made. These changes will enact greater 
economic costs while doing very little 
to offer any additional conservation 
protections for the environment. 
Our communities need reasonable 
compromises to ensure the prosperity 
and enjoyment of our natural environ-
ment for all. This includes the econ-
omy as well as the wildlife and the nat-
ural environment. The Federal Govern-
ment must be committed to this out-
come as well as the State government. 
That is why I rise today, in support 
of targeted reforms to the Endangered 
Species Act that provide for common-
sense solutions that will protect the 
natural environment for all species. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ms. TENNEY for illustrating what 
is necessary common sense and finding 
a balance between protecting species as 
well as protecting a region’s economic 
stability. I thank her very much for 
her leadership in that overall picture. 
We look forward to continuing to work 
with her. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
the 
ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Conservation and For-
estry of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. 
b 2110 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the State of 
Washington, a good friend and chair-
man of our Western Caucus. I appre-
ciate the time and the effort to have 
this time of education here tonight on 
the House floor, and for those who 
would watch and want to actually 
learn what goes on. 
So where do we start on the Endan-
gered Species Act? 
Passed in 1973, signed by Republican 
President Richard Nixon. 
Now, if you were to listen to the 
rhetoric any time Republicans want to 
talk about reforming the Endangered 
Species Act or doing things that make 
sense, I think, out in the woods or with 
water storage, with mining the critical 
minerals we are going to need for a lot 
of these idealistic views, we are going 
to have more and more use of elec-
tricity, you would think that we were

going to be the plunderers of the land. 
Completely not the case. 
The things that are going on right 
now in the time of drought we have in 
the West, in my home State of Cali-
fornia, and the ongoing problems we 
have with nonmanaged timber lands, 
U.S. forest lands, and the resulting ef-
fect that has on private lands with the 
bad neighbors of U.S. lands are typi-
cally to them. 
If we are in a time of drought, we 
need to up our game more so on for-
estry, forest management, thinning, 
and using these materials for the good 
of people. 
We had a toilet paper shortage 
months ago, as ridiculous as that 
sounds in a first-world country like the 
United States, yet we are burning mil-
lions of acres every year. You could 
trace a lot of this back to the misuse, 
the abuse of the Endangered Species 
Act to stop and block the type of work 
we need to be doing. 
We have had hundreds of thousands 
of acres of fire like over there on the 
Western Coast, north coast of Cali-
fornia. They try to put in a project 
after a 400,000-acre burn to do a mini-
mal amount, 7,000 acres of clean up, of 
restoration, of removing some of the 
dead trees and brush and other things 
that were left behind along roadways 
and somewhere around communities, et 
cetera. Environmental lawsuits come 
in and stop them from doing 7,000 
acres, less than 2 percent out of the 
fire. 
So what is the solution to this? Just 
watch these ghost trees stay there, 
watch the brush grow up around all 
this and become the next tinderbox for 
the next fire in 5 or 7 years? 
That seems to be the solution by 
those on the far left that use the En-
dangered Species Act as a weapon to 
stop progress for people, as well as na-
ture, as well as the environment. 
California is in the throes of drought 
right now big time. Our reservoirs are 
way down from just 2 years ago when 
they were all practically full, and 2 
years before that topped off, too. You 
may recall Lake Oroville, the Oroville 
Dam had the spillway break apart in 
the early part of 2017, because the lake 
was actually flowing over the top of 
the emergency spillway. The dam is in 
fine shape. The spillway has been re-
built. And we have stored a lot of water 
between then and now. 
So what has gone on? 
So much water has been released out 
to the Pacific Ocean and not used for 
people use, for agricultural use or even 
smart environmental use. 
The usage of the Endangered Species 
Act as a weapon has devastated so 
much of agriculture in California, 
which maybe people don’t realize that 
90 percent of certain types of crops, the 
vegetable crops that the United States 
people use come from California. Most 
of the almonds that you would use 
come from California. 
Where is this going to come from if 
California is out of business because of 
the misuse and abuse of the Endan-
gered Species Act, because someone 
might decide the coho salmon up in the 
Klamath Basin is more valuable than 
the sucker fish in the Klamath Lake or 
the water foul that gets forgotten 
about in the basin right around there? 
Last year, we had a devastating kill 
on ducks and other wildlife in that 
Klamath 
Basin 
area 
because 
they 
couldn’t get water through the agricul-
tural system to where the refuges are 
for the ducks. 
So what species is it we are going to 
pick? 
The water in the Klamath project ac-
tually is assigned agriculture use. The 
Klamath 
project 
added 
additional 
water storage space to the existing 
Klamath Lake. Oregon courts have al-
ready ruled a couple times that addi-
tional water belongs to agriculture. It 
is not something for the Bureau of Rec-
lamation and the Department of Inte-
rior to use in order to make their equa-
tions work out on the failed applica-
tion to salmon in order to, in their 
idea, flush a virus out of the Klamath 
River. 
There is other evidence out there 
saying this is actually the opposite of 
what you should do. That the virus— 
the C. shasta virus is actually propa-
gated by these additional flows. It is 
done year after year after year, and the 
virus keeps returning. Maybe you need 
to let that stuff dry out. 
Also, the sucker fish that they are 
trying to protect in the lake, the bot-
tom feeding fish, too much water in the 
lake studies show by the NAS—Na-
tional Academy of Sciences—that too 
much water in that lake makes them 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
predators 
and 
doesn’t help the sucker fish, which is 
good at living in a shallow amount of 
water. So we are going in opposite di-
rections. 
Agriculture is devastated in the 
Klamath Basin. You are probably not 
going to see the potatoes that In-N-Out 
Burger uses, horseradish, mint, other 
products, as well as a lot of hay crops. 
They are not going to happen this year, 
except for whatever water they can get 
from wells up there; not going happen. 
So when you see these things not on 
your store shelf anymore, you will 
know that there is something going on, 
or when you see them highly over-
priced because we have to get them 
from some foreign country. You are 
going to see the root causes because 
the California water supply has been 
frittered away for other things besides 
useful purposes. 
And this isn’t in defiance of the ESA 
or 
helping 
species, 
but 
the 
right 
science isn’t being used. When you 
have one-term paper written being used 
as gospel on the Klamath River as set-
ting policy versus a lot of other evi-
dence—they want to remove the hydro-
electric dams on the Klamath River. 
Now, when we are talking about 
drought in California, when we already 
have lakes and reservoirs that are low, 
we have—Lake Oroville is going to be 
at dead pool probably about mid-Au-
gust. 
Now, what is the temperature in mid- 
August? 
Not quite near what my colleague in 
Arizona was speaking about, but it is 
hot. So when we have this water supply 
run out, unable to produce the hydro-
electric power that we normally could 
because we could store it, then we are 
going to have more power shortages, 
not just because of power shutoffs. Be-
cause when the wind blows in Cali-
fornia, now we have to shut off the 
power because trees and things might 
blow branches into the power lines and 
cause another devastating fire, like 
what is known as the Camp Fire that 
devastated the town of Paradise, also 
in my district. 
Where is the common sense with 
this? Where is the common sense of ap-
plying if we have drought conditions 
or, as the left likes to talk about every 
other speech in this Chamber, climate 
change, the religion of climate change? 
Okay. If the blankety-blank climate 
is changing, why aren’t we storing 
more water since we, as people, are 
smart enough to know we will need a 
water supply? 
Why aren’t we doing more to cause 
electricity be generated at that water 
storage site? 
Why aren’t we doing more to trim 
and manage our forests that are over-
crowded? 
Way too many trees per acre when 
they have been managed that way for 
100 years. 
Instead, we go on and on, and some-
body comes up with a lawsuit to pre-
vent us from managing forests that 
way, prevent us from storing addi-
tional water. 
Not to mention when we talk about 
all cars have to become electric by 
2035. I know a lot of people who aren’t 
interested in buying electric cars. 
What happened to the choice people 
have of vehicles, the size and the style 
they seek to have? 
Yet we are hell-bent on electrifying 
everything. In the bay area, they want 
to ban gas stoves and gas appliances in 
people’s homes because of some ideal-
istic view of the environment and 
somehow tying that back to the misuse 
of the Endangered Species Act. 
All this ties together. The Endan-
gered Species Act has been a great tool 
to shut down the things we need to do, 
whether it is the expansion of a high-
way, water storage. Shasta Dam right 
now in my district could be raised 18 
feet and add right away 640,000 acre- 
feet of water on those full years. 640,000 
acre-feet would be enough for 1.2 mil-
lion homes or 200,000 acres of crops 
that people watching this right now 
like to have for their fresh fruits, for 
their salads, for their vegetables, what-
ever it would be. And this is all going 
to be gone. 
Do you like imported oil? Did you 
love the oil shortages back in the sev-
enties? Do you like this $4 or $5 or $6 
gas and diesel we are having right now?

Then you are going to love imported 
food. 
And the Endangered Species Act has 
been used as a weapon to stop people 
from farming, from timbering, from 
mining, basic things that we need in 
order to have our electronics, to have 
copper for our wiring, any of those 
things. 
b 2120 
It has been such a weapon since 1973, 
when it was passed with good inten-
tions. And I still think we need to have 
it. It saved the bald eagle. It saved a 
lot of things. But also, its record over-
all, looking at savings of endangered 
species, is a pretty low number. Why? 
Because of ridiculous regulations and 
ridiculous 
biological 
opinions 
that 
don’t even connect the dots of how this 
is going to help the salmon in the 
Klamath River or farther up in Wash-
ington where they want to rip some of 
those dams out, too, and take away 
that hydroelectric power. 
Where are we going to get the stored 
water? Where are we going to get the 
hydroelectric power? You want to com-
pletely rely on what is a narrow part of 
the grid, solar power or wind power? 
You can’t even rely on those, not for a 
major part of the grid. We need to have 
24–7 electricity you can count on with 
either biomass, wood products stacked 
on the deck, the waste wood that 
should come from the forestry that we 
should be doing but aren’t doing nearly 
fast enough, or natural gas plants. We 
have so much gas in this country now 
because of hydraulic fracturing, but 
that is vilified, too. 
Pipelines bringing energy where it is 
needed is vilified, too, because they are 
using an endangered species somewhere 
as a tool to stop these developments. 
Americans, enjoy these high prices 
you are getting right now. Enjoy these 
shortages of electricity, of fuel, the 
higher cost of food, the shortage of cer-
tain food items, because the usage of 
the Endangered Species Act—and the 
usage of other environmental laws that 
have been abused—that has been com-
pletely taken out of context from the 
original intent like Congress passed 
back in 1973 or layered upon in recent 
years. 
We have to reform this process. It is 
not because Republicans want to plun-
der the planet. That is so tiresome. 
Any time we talk about forest manage-
ment, oh, you are going to clear cut ev-
erything—I’m 
from 
northern 
Cali-
fornia—from here to Oregon, or some-
where else. 
That is not it at all. Talk to any 
smart timber operation, and they have 
80- to 100-year plans for the private 
lands that they manage. If you could 
fly 
over 
and 
look 
at 
how 
these 
timberlands are managed, you can tell 
there is generally a checkerboard of 
private land versus Federal land. You 
can see the different squares as they 
are managed either before a fire, ongo-
ing, or after a fire. 
Just fly over one 3 years after a fire 
and see who has actually been out 
there cleaning up their lands and try-
ing to restore things versus unmanaged 
Federal land, which is still the big 
mess it was right after the fire. You 
will see the way the government is 
doing it, the way the left is foisting 
these ridiculous rules and laws upon us 
and not allowing us to do reasonable 
reform to bring just a little bit of bal-
ance back into what was passed 50 
years ago into what we have to deal 
with. 
At this time, when we are watching 
things go way off-kilter here under this 
administration, I just remind those 
watching to look at the root cause. It 
all ties together, the Endangered Spe-
cies Act, other environmental laws, 
other lawsuits, when you can’t even 
turn around to do a simple thing with-
out somebody coming after you, suing 
you over it. 
Look around your own home. Try to 
build a deck on your own home and 
someone is going to try to environ-
mentally slow you down on that these 
days. Farmers are getting fined for 
building a pond on their land in the 
Western States in order to retain a lit-
tle more water for their cattle. 
When you see the high prices of these 
things all happening, look at the root 
cause. Enjoy these high prices of fuel 
and electricity and the shortage there, 
and know it is not because of our poli-
cies here but because of the policies of 
misuse and abuse of endangered species 
laws, of environmental laws, and all 
the lawsuits that go along with them. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman has certainly been a 
true leader on this issue and a pas-
sionate, experienced, and knowledge-
able voice. We appreciate his work on 
the Western Caucus. 
We cannot continue to use a one-size- 
fits-all approach. That often leads to 
mismanagement. The gentleman’s ex-
amples and illustrations bear that out 
to be true, and I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with him on this issue. 
As I mentioned earlier, the Biden ad-
ministration has proposed a massive 
rollback of recent improvements to the 
ESA, or the Endangered Species Act. 
Many members from the caucus and 
across the country and I are very con-
cerned that these rollbacks will ham-
per our ability to work with local lead-
ers on species recovery. 
I think it is also worth mentioning 
that the administration’s actions are 
in direct contrast to their report on 
the proposed 30 by 30 initiative, which 
aims to conserve 30 percent of our Na-
tion’s lands and waters by the year 
2030. Their report claims that as part of 
this initiative, they will recognize and 
reward voluntary conservation efforts 
of private landowners and recognize 
the contributions of farmers and ranch-
ers, forest owners, and others in rural 
America. Instead, they are looking to 
impose even more Federal restrictions 
on these conservation partners, and 
that is the opposite to the approach 
that we should be taking. 
Madam Speaker, quite frankly, it ig-
nites even greater concerns about the 
administration’s so-called conservation 
initiative. 
Madam Speaker, just to remind you, 
I started off the evening saying that it 
was nearly 50 years ago that President 
Nixon signed the Endangered Species 
Act into law. If you will recall, it was 
designed to do two things: prevent spe-
cies from going extinct and promote 
their recovery back to health and 
healthy populations. 
I think we have heard tonight that 
we can accomplish that, and we need to 
accomplish that. A strong ESA and 
strong recovered species can happen, 
but they don’t have to happen at the 
expense of communities and our econ-
omy. Those two things are not mutu-
ally exclusive. 
I think the arguments, the cases, and 
the illustrations that you have heard 
tonight perfectly allow us to under-
stand that. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of my 
colleagues from the Western Caucus for 
participating tonight. This is a very 
important issue, something that I 
think all of us in Congress can find a 
lot of common ground on. I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle on successful re-
form of the Endangered Species Act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

HONORING MICHELLE ALLMAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Caribbean Heritage Month, I recog-
nize Michelle Allman. 
Michelle, otherwise known as Coach 
Mea Allman, born in Jamaica, comes 
from a diverse, mixed cultural herit-
age: her father, Costa Rican, and her 
mother, 
Jamaican, 
Arawak 
Indian, 
Scot. She was raised in Canada and 
now resides in Florida. 
She noticed early in her career the 
bullying of young people with cultural 
accents in schools and the general lack 
of awareness about their Caribbean 
heritage. Coach Mea felt a need to be 
part of educating her Caribbean-Amer-
ican community by publishing an on-
line 
publication 
called 
Karibbean 
Under One Magazine in 2008, along with 
her son, Michael Morgan, as cofounder 
and CFO, to show the richness of di-
verse cultures; to be a community liai-
son for other Caribbean organizations 
and businesses to provide resources, 
outreach, disaster relief; and to help 
others to unite and grow our cultural 
awareness in the larger community. 
As a cultural advocate, she is pas-
sionate about building a welcoming 
community with her Women of Kulture 
brand that comes together as commu-
nity leaders to educate, empower, and 
celebrate while keeping their own 
sense of cultural identity. 
As 
a 
certified 
professional 
life, 
health, and nutrition coach, she en-
courages others to make, meet, and ex-
ceed goals in both their personal and

professional lives by using her success 
as a 21-year breast cancer survivor as a 
health advocate to produce and host 
her monthly virtual show, ‘‘G.L.O.W. 
365 = Greater Level of Wellness 365,’’ 
that brings awareness of the latest 
health and wellness information in 
America and the Caribbean islands. 
She also celebrates and honors indi-
viduals who have overcome or continue 
to battle chronic illnesses and condi-
tions with her Ribbons of Survivors 365 
brand that launched in 2014. 
Additionally, she is an empowering 
speaker for KweliWorks and host of 
several virtual shows. And now, she is 
the international cultural ambassador 
for the Orlando International Film 
Festival Lions Club. Her focus this 
year is to provide a platform to cele-
brate Caribbean filmmakers. 
For this and more, Michelle Allman, 
we honor you.

HONORING RACHELLE R. GRAND-PIERRE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of 
Caribbean-American 
Heritage 
Month, I would like to recognize 
Rachelle R. Grand-Pierre. 
Rachelle 
R. 
Grand-Pierre 
is 
the 
founder of RGP Law Firm, a boutique 
immigration law firm in central Flor-
ida specializing in immigration, re-
moval defense, and humanitarian re-
lief. 
Rachelle received her bachelor of 
arts degree in English, creative writ-
ing, at the University of Central Flor-
ida. She earned her Juris Doctor at 
Barry University where she was a 
member of the inaugural class of the 
collaborative family law clinic. 
Rachelle currently serves on the ex-
ecutive board of the Central Florida 
Chapter of the American Immigration 
Lawyers Association as regional vice 
president of Orlando where she liaises 
between the organization and the U.S. 
Immigration and Citizenship Services 
office in Orlando. 
As the daughter of brave, hard-
working, Haitian immigrants, Rachelle 
saw firsthand how immigrants self-
lessly dedicate themselves to providing 
better lives for their families. For this 
reason, Rachelle has a passion for 
fighting for immigrants to have the 
ability to live, love, and work in the 
United States the way she has been 
blessed to do. 
Rachelle has had the opportunity to 
help hundreds of immigrants in her ca-
reer, and she hopes that she will con-
tinue to touch the lives of countless 
others. Even though she is from south 
Florida, Rachelle has called central 
Florida her home for over 14 years. 
When Rachelle is not tirelessly fight-
ing for her clients, she can be found 
traveling, cooking, and spending qual-
ity time with her family. 
For this and more, Ms. Rachelle R. 
Grand-Pierre, we honor you. 
HONORING DOREEN EDWARDS-BARKER 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of 
Caribbean-American 
Heritage 
Month, I would like to recognize Do-
reen Edwards-Barker. 
Originally of Caribbean descent from 
Jamaica West Indies, Doreen Edwards- 
Barker relocated to Boston, Massachu-
setts, in the early seventies. 
Doreen’s philosophy is ‘‘no one is 
useless in this world who lightens the 
burdens of another.’’ She has accom-
plished this by pursuing a nursing de-
gree and attending Bethel Bible Col-
lege. While attending Bethel Bible Col-
lege, Doreen joined a street outreach 
ministry team feeding the homeless on 
the streets. 
Looking at the possibility of a life 
change and an escape from cold win-
ters, Doreen and her husband, Aldwin 
Barker, chose to call Kissimmee, Flor-
ida, their new home in 2002. Imme-
diately, Doreen saw the same need that 
she saw in Boston. She realized helping 
others was the secret to living a 
happier, healthier, and more produc-
tive, and meaningful live. 
Her passion was in her giving. They 
founded Clarita’s House, Inc., and that 
later changed to Clarita’s House Out-
reach Ministry, Inc., or CHOM, as a 
testament to her late mother, Clarity 
Edwards. The outreach ministry has 
covered areas in Orlando for the Coali-
tion For the Homeless as well as now 
in Kissimmee. 
CHOM 
consistently 
serves 
the 
unsheltered and homeless by helping to 
build trust relationships with those 
hardest to reach. They also reach out 
to people living in the woods and home-
less shelters of the community. This is 
done by providing groceries, new and 
gently used clothing, hygiene supplies, 
and down-payment assistance when 
needed. 
CHOM also works with the Infinite 
Scholars Program, facilitating scholar-
ship fairs for more than 500 students 
and their families, resulting in $10 mil-
lion in scholarship offers. 
Doreen has been recognized multiple 
times within the community, even 
though she has never sought recogni-
tion for her work. 
CHOM was awarded the 2021 Best of 
Kissimmee award in the category of 
charity services. Additionally, CHOM 
accepted the Second Harvest Food 
Bank of Central Florida’s selection as 
the 2020 Osceola County Agency of the 
year. 
For this and more, Ms. Doreen 
Edwards-Barker, we honor you. 
HONORING ANDY KING 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of 
Caribbean-American 
Heritage 
Month, I would like to recognize Andy 
King. 
Andy King currently works in the Fi-
nance/Shared Services department for 
the publisher Houghton Mifflin Har-
court. 
For the past 10 years, Andy has 
served as president of the board of di-
rectors of Southchase Parcel 5 Home-
owners Association and served pre-
viously as president of the Southchase 
West Master Homeowners Association. 
His career also allowed for exposure in 
the management of some prominent 
business departments in the private 
and public sectors, such as banking, 
customer service, credit management, 
and a stint in project management 
with New York City’s Department of 
Housing Preservation and 
Develop-
ment. 
He is also a founding member and 
past-president of the Guyanese-Amer-
ican Cultural Association of Central 
Florida, treasurer of the Ann Marie De 
Goveia Scholarship Fund, and imme-
diate past-president and current chair-
man of the advisory board of the Carib-
bean and Floridian Association. 
Andy credits these experiences with 
helping him to lead the call for the pro-
motion and introduction of programs 
and activities that are consistent with 
the desires of the Caribbean-American 
community. 
He was instrumental in launching 
the annual Caribbean Fusion Festival 
in Osceola County, a cultural collabo-
ration between CAFA and the City of 
Kissimmee, and also the annual Tur-
key Giveaway at Thanksgiving in Kis-
simmee. Andy is married and the fa-
ther of two. 
For this and more, Mr. Andy King, 
we honor you. 
HONORING STERLING BLAKE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of 
Caribbean-American 
Heritage 
Month, I would like to recognize Ster-
ling Blake. 
Hailing from Jamaica West Indies, 
Sterling C. Blake came to the great 
United States of America as a sugar-
cane farmworker. He has resided in 
Kissimmee, Florida, for most of his 
life, where he served as an assistant 
pastor at the Church of God in Christ 
for 24 years. 
Sterling then started a landscaping 
company in 1987, and the company 
grew tremendously. In 1994, Sterling 
Silver Scape & Sod, Inc., was nomi-
nated as the third largest African- 
American business in the central Flor-
ida area, and he was featured in the Or-
lando Business Journal that same year, 
and also in 2006. Sterling was also hon-
ored by the Orange County Minority 
Board department. 
Sterling served on the board of the 
Council on Aging for 10 years and is 
also the pastor of Restore the Path for 
Christ church located in Kissimmee, 
Florida. 
Sterling was also a member of the 
Tuskegee Airmen for over 10 years, and 
his commitment to the Tuskegee Air-
men has afforded him the honor of a 
red jacket. 
Sterling has served his community 
well by feeding the poor, visiting the 
sick in the hospitals, and helping the 
needy. Sterling is known in his com-
munity as an upstanding and honest 
businessman. 
For this and more, Mr. Sterling 
Blake, we honor you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2743 
June 14, 2021 
Ms. Grace Peek-Harris has served the 
central Florida LGBTQ-plus commu-
nity for several years. Grace’s Navy ca-
reer brought her to the region in the 
1990s where she served on several de-
ployments, including Operation Endur-
ing Freedom. In 1998, she transitioned 
from active duty to the reserves and 
joined the Orlando Police Department. 
While at OPD, she became well- 
known as an advocate for LGBTQ-plus 
issues and a friend to the LGBTQ-plus 
community. After the Pulse tragedy, 
Grace was officially appointed as the 
lead LGBTQ liaison where she contin-
ued to foster numerous relationships 
throughout the Orlando area and be-
came the first full-time driver of the 
#0049 Orlando United patrol car. While 
in this role, Grace played an integral 
part in expanding the Safe Place pro-
gram where over 230 Orlando businesses 
display a sticker identifying them as a 
safe place to report LGBTQ crimes. 
In 2019, Grace founded the Gay Offi-
cers Action League of Central Florida, 
GOALcfl, whose mission is to support, 
educate, and promote positive relation-
ships between LGBTQ, law enforce-
ment and the communities they serve. 
Under her leadership as president, 
GOALcfl has become a driving force 
within the community by bridging the 
gap between the two. 
She has led the organization through 
tremendous growth and has supported 
many central Florida LGBTQ-plus non- 
profits. In 2021, GOALcfl hosted their 
first major training event in partner-
ship with the Matthew Shepard Foun-
dation. This day-long program edu-
cated many community advocates, law 
enforcement, and legal personnel on 
current hate crimes legislation. 
Grace retired as a commander from 
the Navy after 23 years and retired as a 
master sergeant from OPD after 20 
years. 
b 2140 
She currently enjoys serving on the 
board of The Center and GOALcfl and 
continuing to volunteer with LGBTQ- 
plus organizations, including Zebra Co-
alition and KindRED Pride Founda-
tion. 
Grace lives in Windermere with her 
wife, Elie and their son, Dylan. 
For this and more, Ms. Grace Peek- 
Harris, we honor you. 
HONORING ELEANOR MCDONOUGH 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of LGBTQ-plus 
Pride Month, I would like to recognize 
Eleanor McDonough. 
Ms. Eleanor McDonough was born 
and raised in Manchester-by-the-Sea, 
Massachusetts, to parents Frank and 
Sally McDonough. She moved to Kis-
simmee, Florida, in 2016 where she 
came out as a transgender woman. She 
currently works as a legislative assist-
ant 
to 
Representative 
Kristen 
Arrington 
of 
Kissimmee, 
Florida, 
House District 43, and is the only out 
transgender person working at the 
Florida Capitol. 
She previously worked for the Flor-
ida Democratic Party as a field orga-
nizer in Osceola County in the Celebra-

HONORING MANDY KIMMER 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of LGBTQ-plus 
Pride Month I would like to recognize 
Mandy Kimmer. 
Mandy Kimmer, APR, CPRC, is the 
public information officer for Orange 
County Parks and Recreation, having 
worked there for 13 years. 
Born and raised near Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, she earned her BA de-
grees in public relations, journalism, 
and economics from Florida Southern 
College in Lakeland in 1983. 
In 
2015 
she 
and 
friend 
Karen 
Castelloes cofounded the Zebra Coali-
tion’s Jefferson R. Voss Education 
Fund for LGBTQ-plus students in cen-
tral Florida, establishing an endowed 
scholarship at the University of Cen-
tral Florida and helping direct funds 
from a separate donation for students 
pursuing courses for a GED or tech-
nical and community college. Since the 
inception of this funding, numerous 
students have received thousands of 
dollars in financial assistance to fur-
ther their education. 
After the Pulse tragedy occurred in 
Orlando on June 12, 2016, Mandy formed 
the LGBTQ Pride and Allies of Orange 
County for county colleagues and oth-
ers outside the organization. Knowing 
that people wanted to help and needed 
to heal, she invited LGBT community 
leaders to speak at meetings held in 
Orange County’s administration build-
ing. Topics included volunteer opportu-
nities with Zebra Coalition, civil rights 
work of Equality Florida, community 
involvement of The LGBT-plus Center 
Orlando, personal transgender stories, 
and coming-out experiences of youth 
and adults. Five years later this small 
assembly is now in the process of meet-
ing requirements to become a recog-
nized employee resource group for the 
Orange County government’s 8,000 em-
ployees. 
Mandy has sung first alto and second 
soprano parts in the Orlando Gay Cho-
rus for the past 4 years and is a 9-year 
breast cancer survivor. She is the 
proud mom of sons Matthew Luber, a 
former U.S. marine, and Andrew Luber, 
who is majoring in accounting at the

more, 
Ms. 
Mandy 
Kimmer, we honor you.

Mr. SOTO. In honor of LGBTQ-plus 
Pride Month, I would like to recognize 
Brandon Wolf. 
Life changed for Brandon Wolf when, 
on June 12, 2016, he escaped Pulse 
nightclub with his life. That night a 
gunman murdered 49 mostly LGBTQ 
people of color, including his best 
friends, Drew and Juan, celebrating in 
their safe space. 
In the wake of the tragedy, Brandon 
dedicated his life to honoring the vic-
tims with action. He has become a 
fierce advocate for commonsense gun 
safety reforms, becoming the first sur-
vivor of the shooting to share his testi-
mony before this Congress. He fre-
quently steps forward to share his 
story courageously and demands better 
from lawmakers. 
Brandon 
has 
also 
become 
an 
unapologetic advocate for LGBTQ civil 
rights, 
amplifying 
the 
voices 
of 
marginalized 
people 
and 
resisting 
homophobia and transphobia. 
He cofounded The Dru Project, a 
youth-serving organization that has 
given over $100,000 in college funding to 
emerging LGBTQ leaders. Brandon also 
serves as the media relations manager 
for Equality Florida, our State’s larg-

For this and more, Mr. Brandon Wolf,

HONORING JOEL JUNIOR MORALES 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of LGBTQ+ Pride Month, I would like 
to recognize Joel Junior Morales. 
Joel Junior Morales—pronouns he, 
him, his, el,—is a proud queer Puerto 
Rican. He is currently the operations 
director for the LGBT+ Center Or-
lando, spearheading efforts to affirm 
and empower the LGBTQ+ community. 
Morales served as a victim service 
navigator during the aftermath of the 
Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, 
2016. He assisted more than 900 individ-
uals and 255 families, alongside 50 other 
government, community, and business 
organizations at the Family Assistance 
Center, which transitioned to being 
what is known now as the Orlando 
United 
Assistance, 
currently 
under 
Joel’s leadership. 
He was instrumental in creating the 
Central Florida LGBTQ+ Relief Fund, a 
collaboration of several LGBTQ organi-
zations and mutual aid fund that 
helped over 700 LGBTQ+ families dur-
ing the peak of the pandemic in 2020. 
Throughout volunteerism, a long-
standing community builder, Joel is 
one of the cofounders of QLatinx, a 
grassroots racial, social, and gender 
justice organization dedicated to the 
advancement and empowerment of the 
LGBTQ+ Latinx community. 
He also serves on many community 
boards, 
including 
grant 
committee 
member for Contigo Fund, stakeholder 
forum for the National Mass Violence 
Victimization Resource Center, leader-
ship team for the American Cancer So-
ciety, and others. 
An advocate for survivors, he was 
trained and certified with the Florida 
Crisis Response Team. Joel is also the 
regional chapter coordinator for Crime 
Survivors for Safety and Justice. He 
advocated and organized around Flor-
ida House bill 7125. The new Florida 
policy improves the probation system, 
gets Floridians back to work, and re-
moves barriers to victims’ compensa-
tion. 
In addition, Joel has recently joined 
the Office for Victims of Crime Train-
ing and Technical Assistance Center as 
a consultant under the Antiterrorism 
and Emergency Assistance Program,

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 14, 2021 
No. 103 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Oh, Lord, our God, sometimes life’s 
issues seem too much for us. Forgive us 
when we speak words of despair, forget-
ting Your promise that You will never 
leave or forsake us. 
Lord, speak to the faith of our law-
makers, causing them also to remem-
ber Your promise that, in everything, 
You are working for the good of those 
who love You. 
Give us all the wisdom to know that 
You 
are, 
indeed, 
our 
refuge 
and 
strength. Answer us, mighty God, at a 
time You choose. Answer our prayers 
because of Your great love. Send us 
forth to serve You by embracing jus-
tice, loving mercy, and walking with 
humility. 
We 
pray 
in 
Your 
compassionate 
Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
COVID–19 VACCINATIONS 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we 
had interesting news in Vermont this 
morning. 
Our 
Governor, 
Governor 
Scott, announced that we have reached 
80 percent immunity—vaccinations— 
and so the State will, in effect, reopen. 
Now, I mention this because, right 
from the beginning, I have worked 
closely with our Governor. We have 
tried to show no partisanship in this. I 
am a Democrat; he is a Republican. We 
are 
both, 
first 
and 
foremost, 
Vermonters. 
And restrictions were put in place. 
Efforts were made to vaccinate. I know 
my wife Marcelle and I went to some of 
these vaccination centers. We had ev-
erybody from Vermont National Guard 
to veterans groups, to schools, to 
nurses who were volunteering all over 
those places. 
And everybody would line up, and 
they would say: ‘‘I am scheduled for 
9:20. I will be there at 9:10,’’ and they 
just went through, and people wanted 
to get the vaccination. 
It meant some hardships while it was 
going on because a lot of our businesses 
could not open or had to open just in 
limited ways. 
But—but they kept at it, and we all 
worked together to help with aid to the 
State during the COVID time, and I 
was proud of what I might be able to 
do, but I am mostly proud of the 
Vermonters. They set politics aside; 
they set partisanship aside; and they 
said: How would it make us a safer 
State? 
So I just thought I would note that, 
all my trips back home, all the times I 
joined with the various people—Dr. Le-
vine, our chief physician in Vermont, 
and the Governor and others, our Lieu-
tenant Governor, Molly Gray—all of us 
worked together, and it has paid off. 
And I must admit, when I go home 
this weekend, this coming weekend, I 
am going to walk off that plane with a 
bigger smile than I usually have. 
I always have a smile coming home 
to the State where I was born, but this 
weekend it is going to be an especially 
big smile. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
tonight, 
congressional 
leaders 
will 
mark what is hopefully the final som-
ber milestone of the COVID pandemic: 
600,000 American lives lost to the dis-
ease. It is particularly jarring at this 
moment—a moment of recovery, opti-
mism, and hope—to remember the 
enormity of lives lost over the past 15 
months. Not only that, we face the 
grim reality that the recent fatalities 
happened while Americans were on the 
verge of getting vaccinated. Some had 
their appointment just days away. 
So as our fellow Americans are tak-
ing their masks off, going back to 
work, seeing families and friends, and 
returning, as they should, to life, let us 
remember those who cannot. Let us 
hold them in our hearts a little while 
longer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4504 
June 14, 2021 
I am reminded of the famous medita-
tion by the English soldier and poet 
John Donne, who told us that ‘‘no man 
is an island, entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the 
main. So if a clod be washed away by 
the sea, Europe is the less.’’ 
‘‘Any man’s death diminishes me,’’ 
he said, ‘‘because I am involved in 
mankind. And therefore never send to 
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls 
for thee.’’ 
The bells have tolled for 600,000 
Americans this past year, a staggering 
and incomprehensible sum. Remember 
them. Hold them in your hearts a little 
while longer. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on a different subject, after pass-
ing the bipartisan U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act last week and con-
firming the first judges of the Biden 
era, we will continue with major ele-
ments of our legislative agenda. 
Senate 
committees 
will 
continue 
working on a bipartisan infrastructure 
proposal to meet the demands of the 
21st century. As I have said from the 
start, discussions about infrastructure 
investments are progressing on two 
tracks. One track is bipartisan. The 
second track pulls in other elements of 
President Biden’s American Jobs Plan, 
which will be considered even if it does 
not have bipartisan support. Our Sen-
ate committees are working on both 
tracks at the same time. 
As a reminder to the Senate—a re-
minder to the Senate—as I have said 
from the start, in order to move for-
ward on infrastructure, we must in-
clude bold action on climate. At the 
moment, both tracks are moving for-
ward and progressing very well. 
In addition, before the end of the 
month, the Senate will vote on crucial 
voting rights legislation. Republican 
State legislatures across the country 
are passing the most draconian voting 
restrictions since the beginning of Jim 
Crow. Congress must take action to de-
fend our democracy. 
Meanwhile, we will move more swift-
ly to confirm even more of the Presi-
dent’s appointments, including several 
to the Federal bench. 
Last week was one for the record 
books. The Senate confirmed the first 
slate of President Biden’s judicial 
nominees. Not only were they individ-
uals of immense talent and high char-
acter, they reflected the great cultural, 
geographic, and experiential diversity 
of our country. Among them was the 
first Muslim American to ever be con-
firmed as an article III judge. 
Let me read a headline from this 
morning’s Washington Post: ‘‘Biden 
has 
nominated 
as 
many 
minority 
women to be judges in four months as 
Trump had confirmed in four years.’’ 
That is an amazing—an amazing—sta-
tistic. 
Women, especially women of color, 
have long been underrepresented on the 
Federal bench. Along with President 
Biden, the Senate Democratic majority 
is working quickly to close the gap. 
In fact, in just a few hours, we will 
confirm another outstanding, trail-
blazing nominee for the Federal bench, 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the 
DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge 
Jackson will be the first of President 
Biden’s circuit court nominees con-
firmed by the Senate, and we are start-
ing right at the top. 
After the Supreme Court, the DC Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals is the most im-
portant Federal court in the country, 
with jurisdiction over cases involving 
Congress and the executive branch 
Agencies, and Judge Jackson, nomi-
nated to the seat once occupied by the 
current Attorney General, is the per-
fect person for the job. She is a former 
Federal defender. She clerked for Jus-
tice Breyer, and, since 2013, has been a 
district court judge in DC. She has all 
the qualities of a model jurist. She is 
brilliant, 
thoughtful, 
collaborative, 
and dedicated to applying the law im-
partially. For these qualities, she has 
earned the respect of both sides. 
Nominees to powerful circuit courts, 
especially the DC Circuit, are fre-
quently controversial, but, last week, a 
bipartisan group of Senators in the Ju-
diciary Committee voted in her favor. I 
greatly look forward to confirming this 
exceptional nominee in just a few 
hours and continuing to restore bal-
ance to a judiciary that has been 
thrown out of whack by former Presi-
dent Trump. 
After Judge Brown Jackson’s con-
firmation, we will turn to other nomi-
nees. We will hold a cloture vote this 
evening on Lina Khan’s nomination to 
the Federal Trade Commission and 
confirm her tomorrow. Tomorrow, as 
well, we will vote on Kiran Ahuja to 
lead the Office of Personnel Manage-
ment, and the Senate will have the op-
portunity to advance several of the 
nominees as the week goes on. 
f 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
INVESTIGATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
one final matter, despite the fact that 
we are now almost 6 months into a new 
administration, the sins of the previous 
administration are coming to life. Late 
last week, the New York Times re-
ported that the Trump administra-
tion’s Justice Department delivered se-
cret subpoenas for the personal phone 
data of at least a dozen people tied to 
the House Intelligence Committee, in-
cluding Members of Congress, aides, 
and even family members. One was a 
minor. 
This is a gross abuse of power. It is 
an assault on the separation of powers. 
The notion that any President, via 
their political appointees, could manip-
ulate our democratic system to tap 
into personal data has the fingerprints 
of a dictatorship—a dictatorship—all 
over it. 
This appalling politicization of the 
Department 
of 
Justice 
by 
Donald 
Trump and his sycophants must be in-
vestigated by both the DOJ inspector 
general and by Congress. Former At-
torneys General Barr and Sessions and 
other officials who were involved must 
testify before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, under oath. If they refuse, 
they are subject to being subpoenaed 
and compelled to testify under oath. 
The Justice Department must also 
provide information to the Judiciary 
Committee, which will vigorously in-
vestigate this abuse of power. The issue 
should not be partisan. Under the Con-
stitution, Congress is a coequal branch 
of government and must be protected 
from an overreaching executive. We ex-
pect our Republican colleagues to join 
us in getting to the bottom of this 
very, very serious matter. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

BURMA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the military junta that seized power 
from Burma’s democratically elected 
leaders back in February has kept up 
its campaign of brutal and violent re-
pression. More than 800 people are now 
dead, and more than 5,000 others have 
been detained on various charges of re-
sistance. 
Just today, the longtime leader of 
Burma’s democracy, my good friend 
Aung San Suu Kyi, stood for the begin-
ning of a show trial. Other members of 
the National League for Democracy are 
awaiting their own appearances before 
the sham court, and many more pro-
testers, journalists, and activists are 
filling Burma’s prisons right up to the 
rim. 
Several foreigners have been among 
those detained, including Australian 
economist Sean Turnell and two Amer-
ican journalists, Nathan Maung and 
Danny Fenster. The State Department 
has reported that both U.S. citizens 
were 
denied 
consular 
access. 
Mr. 
Maung reportedly even endured torture 
during his detention. 
The people of Burma are well ac-
quainted with the brutality of the 
Tatmadaw’s military rule, but the 
wider international community is re-
ceiving a sobering reminder of the 
challenges facing the country’s pro-de-
mocracy movement and of the junta’s 
willingness to flout even the most 
basic international norms and treaty 
obligations. 
I appreciate the continued attention 
the Biden administration is giving to 
the crisis. Over the weekend, I was par-
ticularly encouraged by the G–7 lead-
ers’ joint condemnation of the junta 
and by the reiteration of a shared com-
mitment to shutting off the flow of any 
assistance funds that might help the 
military further their repression. 
Of course, for friends of democracy, 
including the United States, there is 
more to be done to translate words into 
action. It is time to expand the sanc-
tions aimed at the military to include 
the infamous cronies who continue to 
make 
common 
cause 
with 
the 
Tatmadaw. 
It is time for Burma’s neighbors and 
key trading partners to join these 
sanctions efforts and commit to pro-
viding increased humanitarian access 
and assistance, particularly, I would 
say, from Thailand. 
It is time for greater international 
scrutiny of the markets for jade and 
rare earth metals that give the mili-
tary and other bad actors targets for 
exploitation. 
It is time for international bodies 
like the U.N. Security Council to put 
Burma on the agenda and force the 
Tatmadaw’s supporters to defend the 
brutal regime out in the light of day. 
So our work isn’t over, but there is 
reason for optimism. Burma’s ethnic 
minorities, diverse and often divided, 
have united behind the representative 
National Unity Government in peaceful 
opposition to the military rule, and the 
NUG continues to broaden and deepen 
this coalition. 
Earlier this month, the National 
Unity Government announced its pol-
icy on the status of the Rohingya Mus-
lims in the western state of Rakhine, 
pledging accountability for those re-
sponsible for years—years—of violent 
persecution and committing to greater 
inclusion for all of Burma’s ethnic mi-
norities. 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the National Unity 
Government’s important statement on 
this matter be printed in the RECORD at 
this point. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
REPUBLIC
OF
THE UNION
OF MYANMAR NA-
TIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT—POLICY POSI-
TION ON THE ROHINGYA IN RAKHINE STATE 
3 JUNE 2021 
In honour of human rights and human dig-
nity and also to eradicate the conflicts and 
root causes in the Union, the National Unity 
Government aims to build a prosperous and 
federal democratic union where all ethnic 
groups belonging to the Union can live to-
gether peacefully. This objective is clearly 
stated in the Federal Democratic Charter. 
Sovereignty belongs to the member states 
and the people of the member states as pro-
claimed in the guiding principles for the es-
tablishment of a federal democratic union. 
Everyone in the Union has full enjoyment 
of fundamental human rights. All ethnic 
groups who are native to the Union have full 
enjoyment of individual rights held by indi-
vidual people and collective rights held by 
ethnic groups. All citizens who swear alle-
giance to the Union regardless of their eth-
nic origins are considered to have full enjoy-
ment of citizens’ rights. The National Unity 
Government will not tolerate any form of 
discrimination. 
The National Unity Government regards 
the above-mentioned policies as a basis in 
addressing 
the 
matters 
related 
to 
the 
Rohingyas in Rakhine State. We are con-
fident that extensive deliberations, which 
consider the positions of all stakeholders in 
Rakhine State, their historical backgrounds, 
and national and international laws, will en-
able all to find shared solutions in a way 
that respects the human rights of all per-
sons. 
At present, the elimination of the military 
dictatorship has become the common goal of 
the entire people because of the violence 
committed by the illegitimate military 
council. It is also the period of national re-
sistance against the military dictatorship. 
The solidarity of the entire people is now at 
its best. We are confident that we can re-
build a Union that meets the needs of all 
those in the country who have a stake in its 
future. 
After consultations with the many dif-
ferent stakeholders in Rakhine States, in-
cluding Rohingya groups and refugee rep-
resentatives from the IDP camps, the NUG 
here makes clear how it will seek to apply 
these principles for the good of all in the 
Rakhine State. 
The National Unity Government well un-
derstands the violence and gross human 
rights violations inflicted upon Rohingyas

Burma is sympathetic to the plight of the 
Rohingya as all now experience atrocities

Endeavouring to bring the perpetrators to

be ensured in the future Federal Democratic 
Union Constitution. 
We will actively seek justice and account-
ability for all crimes committed by the mili-
tary against the Rohingyas and all other 
people of Myanmar throughout our history. 
We intend if necessary to initiate processes 
to grant International Criminal Court juris-
diction 
over 
crimes 
committed 
within 
Myanmar against the Rohingyas and other 
communities. 
We consider that the 88 recommendations 
set out in the final report of the Advisory 
Commission on Rakhine State chaired by Dr. 
Kofi Annan must play a crucial role in ad-
dressing the affairs in Rakhine State. These 
recommendations are based on solutions for 
the root causes of violence. However, over 
the past four years, much has changed to 
make the situation worse in Rakhine State 
for all ethnic groups there. Using these rec-
ommendations as well as other relevant rec-
ommendations as inputs, we earnestly be-
lieve that we can work together with all the 
people in Rakhine State to chart a new 
course towards a democratic inclusive and 
prosperous future. 
We would also like to highlight the impor-
tance of legal matters in seeing to the 
Rakhine question. We will consider the opin-
ions and views of the entire people in the 
country, including those in Rakhine State, 
in drafting a new constitution that can re-
solve the many problems caused by the 2008 
constitution. The views and insights of all 
can contribute to this process. All the people 
in the country, including all stakeholders in 
Rakhine State, are invited to participate in 
the process of drafting the new constitution. 
Such dialogue is essential to creating a 
shared future for the country. 
The process of repealing, amending, and 
promulgating laws, including the 1982 Citi-
zenship Law, by the new constitution when 
the drafting is completed will be beneficial 
in resolving the conflict in Rakhine State. 
This new Citizenship Act must base citizen-
ship on birth in Myanmar or birth anywhere 
as a child of Myanmar Citizens. 
We further commit to abolishing the proc-
ess of issuing National Verification Cards, a 
process that the military has used against 
Rohingyas and other ethnic groups coer-
cively and with human rights violations. The 
Rohingyas are entitled to citizenship by laws 
that will accord with fundamental human 
rights norms and democratic federal prin-
ciples. 
The voluntary, safe, and dignified repatri-
ation of Rohingyas who fled to neighbouring 
countries 
from 
Rakhine 
State 
due 
to 
Tatmadaw violence is a crucial matter. We 
reaffirm 
the 
agreements 
signed 
with 
neighbouring countries for the repatriation 
process. We are ready to cooperate with all 
stakeholders of good will in a special pro-
gramme to implement the process. We are 
committed to the repatriation of Rohingyas 
as soon as repatriation can be accomplished 
voluntarily, safely, and with dignity. 
The National Unity Government is a gov-
ernment whose primary duty is to fight the 
illegal military dictatorship. While we focus 
on this task, we are also planning for the fu-
ture. We believe it will be beneficial in build-
ing the future democratic federal union to 
listen to all stakeholders in a spirit of col-
laboration. 
Therefore, we invite Rohingyas to join 
hands with us and with others to participate 
in this Spring Revolution against the mili-
tary dictatorship in all possible ways. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. This statement 
represents months of work to build a 
cohesive, inclusive, and representative 
government and the best path toward 
national reconciliation and justice for 
victims of the Tatmadaw’s violence. So 
the NUG’s efforts deserve the full sup-
port of the world’s oldest democracy. 
The pro-democracy movement must 
know that the United States continues 
to stand with them and that we are 
ready to support the hard work of na-
tional reconciliation that still lies 
ahead. 
f 
ATTORNEY GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Now, 
Madam 
President, on one final matter, late 
last week, the Democratic leader and 
the Democratic whip gave in to the 
urge to pick at the scab of politically 
motivated investigations that have be-
come their party’s favorite weapon 
against the previous administration. 
They indicated that they were prepared 
to compel two former Attorneys Gen-
eral to testify before the Judiciary 
Committee on efforts to trace leaks of 
sensitive national security informa-
tion. 
In case anyone had forgotten, our 
colleagues are among the same Demo-
crats who spent years demanding re-
peated investigations of a Republican 
President while turning a blind eye to 
the clear abuses of power that infected 
the investigation of his campaign. So 
any outrage from Democrats that al-
leged criminal leaks within their own 
ranks rightly drew the attention of 
Federal investigators rings completely 
hollow. 
It is particularly disappointing that 
our colleagues have taken to attacking 
former Attorney General Bill Barr over 
investigative decisions that predated— 
predated—his time at the Department 
of Justice. Let me say that again. It is 
particularly disappointing that our col-
leagues have taken to attacking former 
Attorney General Bill Barr over inves-
tigative decisions that occurred when 
he wasn’t there yet. Attorney General 
Barr served our Nation with honor and 
with integrity. These latest attempts 
to tarnish his name bear the telltale 
signs of a witch hunt in the making. 
Here are the facts: The Department 
of Justice is empowered to investigate 
criminal conduct by Members of Con-
gress and their staff. Necessarily, this 
sort of investigation is subject to strict 
procedural protections, and the Depart-
ment’s 
inspector 
general 
is 
fully 
equipped to determine whether these 
procedures were followed in this case. 
So I am confident that the existing in-
quiry will uncover the truth. There is 
no need for a partisan circus here in 
the Congress. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ATTORNEY GENERAL 
INVESTIGATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
just heard the Republican Senate lead-
er warn us not to initiate partisan in-
vestigations. It has only been a few 
weeks since he personally vetoed a bi-
partisan investigation of the attack on 
the U.S. Capitol on January 6 of this 
year. 
For those of us who lived through 
that incident, we find it hard to under-
stand why a 9/11-style Commission, di-
vided equally between both political 
parties, is in any way a partisan inves-
tigation and why the Republican lead-
er, who has served for so long in the 
Senate, would not feel awkward, in a 
way, walking through the halls of this 
Capitol and seeing the men and women 
of the Capitol Police force who have 
sent us a letter begging for a Commis-
sion to get to the bottom of what hap-
pened on that day when 140 men and 
women in uniform were attacked by 
this insurrectionist mob inspired by 
President Trump. 
So when it comes to investigations, 
we have offered the most sanitized 
version of an investigation that one 
could ever ask for. 
So why are we renewing this request 
when it comes to the information 
which is now before us? Well, on Fri-
day, the DOJ inspector general an-
nounced he would investigate DOJ’s 
use of subpoenas to obtain communica-
tion data from Members of Congress 
and the media, including whether the 
Department of Justice complied with 
applicable internal policies and wheth-
er its decisions were motivated by im-
proper considerations. 
What happened was, the previous 
President, Donald Trump, apparently 
had some channel into the Department 
of Justice where he could call for in-
vestigations and information and data 
to be collected about Members of Con-
gress. He highlighted two Democratic 
Members of Congress who were, coinci-
dentally, members of an investigative 
committee of the House Intelligence 
Committee. And then it turns out, in 
the last 2 days, he called for an inves-
tigation of his own White House Coun-
sel. 
So it is very hard to follow who was 
in charge in the White House. The At-
torneys General at the time denied 
having any connection whatsoever to 
these investigations, and certainly the 
White House Counsel wouldn’t have 
called for an investigation of himself. 
So who was running the show? It is a 
legitimate question because it gets to 
not only the issue of leaks, which is 
important, of course, but it gets to the 
more fundamental question of separa-
tion of powers in this government. 
If Members of Congress are subject to 
investigation by a President for some-
thing other than corruption, then cer-
tainly this can be translated into polit-
ical pressure on those individuals. 
So I find it hard to follow the logic of 
the Republican Senate leader, who de-
nies an investigation of the January 6

mob violence on the Capitol—a bipar-
tisan investigation—and then turns 
around and says that the President 
could investigate Members of Congress 
without 
accountability

You 
wonder if there is going to be the prop-
er constitutional authority witnessed 
and exhibited in this circumstance. 
f 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on a 
separate issue, the Senate voted on a 
bipartisan basis to invoke cloture on 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomi-
nation to the DC Circuit. Today, the 
Senate will confirm her to that post. 
Judge Jackson is the first of many 
circuit court nominees whom we will 
confirm during this Congress. Given 
her credentials and record on the 
bench, she is a nominee who deserves 
the support of Senators on both sides 
of the aisle. I would like to take just a 
minute to highlight why she is such an 
outstanding choice for the DC Circuit. 
The importance of the DC Circuit 
cannot be overstated. This is what an-
other 
Illinoisan, 
President 
Barack 
Obama, said about the court: ‘‘The D.C. 
Circuit is known as the second highest 
court in the country, and there’s good 
reason for that. The judges on the D.C. 
Circuit routinely have the final say on 
a broad range of issues involving every-
thing from national security to envi-
ronmental policy; from questions of 
campaign finance to workers’ rights. In 
other words, the court’s decisions im-
pact almost every aspect of our lives.’’ 
Thankfully, in Judge Jackson, we 
have a nominee who will be ready from 
day one to serve justice as a member of 
the DC Circuit. 
Judge Jackson was born here in 
Washington, DC, and raised in Miami, 
FL. Her parents, public school teachers 
at the time of her birth, gave her a life-
long appreciation of learning and the 
law. They also instilled in her a dignity 
and grace that was on full display, as 
the Presiding Officer knows, when the 
judge appeared before the Judiciary 
Committee in April. 
A champion high school debater, 
Jackson later attended Harvard and 
Harvard Law School before embarking 
on what can only be described as a 
star-studded legal career. 
She clerked on the Federal District 
Court, the First Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, and for Justice Breyer on the 
U.S. Supreme Court—a strong resume 
in and of itself. She has also worked at 
several prominent law firms, handling 
both trial and appellate work. 
But her true calling has always been 
public service. In the early 2000s, Judge 
Jackson worked as special counsel on 
the U.S. Sentencing Commission and 
later served as a Federal public de-
fender in Washington, DC. This experi-
ence 
inspired 
President 
Obama 
to 
nominate her to serve as Commissioner 
and Vice Chair of the Sentencing Com-
mission. In the Senate, her nomination 
received unanimous support. 
A few years later, Judge Jackson 
came before the Senate again when 
President Obama chose her to fill a va-
cancy on the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Columbia—once again, 
she was confirmed with unanimous 
support. 
Looking at the arc of Judge Jack-
son’s career, I am struck by how much 
time she spent focusing on the issue of 
criminal sentencing—an issue deeply 
important to me and, I believe, many 
other colleagues. 
From the Sentencing Commission to 
the Office of Federal Public Defender, 
to the district court, Judge Jackson 
has grappled with legal, intellectual, 
and moral challenges that come with 
sentencing policy and decisions. Once 
confirmed, she will bring that vital ex-
perience to the DC Circuit. 
I also want to speak more broadly 
about her record on the bench. She rep-
resents the best of the judiciary. Hum-
ble, hard-working, she has written 
nearly 600 opinions, and each of them is 
guided by the same principles: fairness, 
impartiality, evenhandedness, and an 
unyielding fidelity to the law. It is no 
surprise, then, that she received the 
grade of unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ 
from the American Bar Association, 
and it is no surprise that she has the 
support of legal experts and advocates 
from different ideological and profes-
sional stripes, including Judge Thomas 
Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee to 
the DC Circuit; the Alliance for Jus-
tice; the National Council of Jewish 
Women; the AFL–CIO; the NAACP 
Legal Defense and Education Fund; and 
dozens—literally 
dozens—of 
former 
prosecutors and other Justice Depart-
ment officials appointed by Presidents 
of both political parties. 
Let me close with a passage from a 
letter Judge Griffith wrote in support 
of Judge Jackson. I read this letter 
during her hearing, and it really stuck 
with me. Judge Griffith wrote: ‘‘Al-
though she and I have sometimes dif-
fered on the best outcome of a case, I 
have always respected her careful ap-
proach and agreeable manner, two in-
dispensable traits for success in a col-
legial body.’’ 
Madam President, we will all benefit 
from that careful approach and agree-
able manner on the DC Circuit. 
I will vote for Judge Jackson’s nomi-
nation to the DC Circuit and urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
AMATEUR ATHLETES PROTECTION 
AND COMPENSATION ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am 
on the floor this afternoon to discuss 
the issue of student athletes having 
greater control over their name, image, 
and likeness. 
Over the years, intercollegiate ath-
letics have become a staple in Amer-
ican culture and higher education. No 
other country in the world has a sports 
college model that compares to ours, 
which 
affords 
thousands 
of 
young 
adults each year the opportunity to le-
verage their athletic ability into a 
quality education and continue playing 
the sport they love. But over the years, 
college athletics have grown into an in-
creasingly profitable, billion-dollar in-
dustry, and the rules surrounding ath-
lete compensation have not kept pace. 
Now, individual States have created 
laws that will guarantee an amateur 
athlete the ability to profit off their 
name, image, and likeness without fear 
of being reprimanded. Again, I high-
light that individual States have made 
those decisions and are creating laws. 
Nineteen States have now passed NIL 
legislation, and of those 19, 6 will go 
into effect in less a month—July 1, 
just, really, a few days away. 
As more and more States continue to 
pass their own legislation, we are 
quickly headed for a system of incon-
sistent State laws that will be cum-
bersome and in some cases unworkable 
for athletes and the schools to navi-
gate. Intercollegiate athletics are an 
inherently 
interstate 
matter. 
Our 
model makes certain the best teams 
and the best athletes compete against 
one another no matter their geographic 
location. This requires a single Federal 
standard that all schools and all ath-
letes can operate under. 
College sports and the opportunities 
they provide student athletes will be 
dramatically harmed if we are unable 
to pass a Federal standard. Each year, 
we will have States introducing or up-
dating their NIL laws in order to gain 
just a bit more of an advantage in at-
tracting athletes to their institutions. 
We have already seen this begin to 
play out. Following California’s pas-
sage of the first State NIL law in Sep-
tember 2019, there has been a rush of 
action by 18 other States to quickly 
follow suit, hoping to remain competi-
tive as athletic departments recruit 
athletes to their States’ schools. The 
floodgates will fully open on July 1— 
only 16 days away—when State NIL 
laws begin to take effect. 
The time to act is now. There is a 
compromise to be found to both em-
powering amateur athletes to profit 
from their name, image, and likeness 
and guaranteeing greater protections, 
while at the same time maintaining 
the integrity of our one-of-a-kind colle-
giate model that has provided millions

of people the opportunity to get a qual-
ity education. We can accomplish both 
of these goals and provide college ath-
letics with the certainty that it needs. 
In February, I introduced the Ama-
teur Athletes Protection and Com-
pensation Act—my proposal to accom-
plish this necessary balance. My legis-
lation would create a single set of 
guidelines that would enable amateur 
athletes to profit from their name, 
image, and likeness by prohibiting con-
ferences, schools, and athletic associa-
tions, like the NCAA, from rendering 
an amateur intercollegiate athlete in-
eligible on the basis of receiving that 
NIL compensation. It would also codify 
serious athlete protections like ex-
tended healthcare coverage for athletic 
injuries or illness and scholarship guar-
antees. 
I understand this legislation is not 
perfect in everyone’s eyes. It is not per-
fect in its current form, but it offers 
not only the quickest but the best path 
towards enacting meaningful Federal 
legislation on issues of amateur ath-
letic name, image, and likeness. 
When I say it may not be perfect, 
there are certainly things that we can 
negotiate to improve, and it is not the 
extreme on either side of this issue, but 
it is something that a broad set of Sen-
ators, Members of the House, and a 
President could come behind and cer-
tainly is perhaps the only piece of leg-
islation that has a chance of being en-
acted anytime soon. I recognize there 
are many ideas on what should and 
should not be included in an NIL bill, 
and I welcome those conversations 
with my colleagues. 
I strongly encourage the U.S. Senate, 
the Commerce Committee, and my col-
leagues on that committee to act 
quickly on this urgent matter and join 
us in this legislation to make progress 
on this important issue. The time is 
short, but if we work together, we can 
accomplish a goal that is needed in this 
country and accomplish it by the time 
that it is needed to occur. 
I yield the floor.

f 
WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
for the past 41 years, I have toured our 
State to hear from Iowa workers, our 
community leaders, and our farmers at 
my annual 99 county meetings. So far 
this year, I have been in 71. 
As a farmer myself, I enjoy speaking 
with those involved in agriculture all 
across the State who tell me that they 
are third-, fourth-, fifth-generation 
farmers. These folks use the same soil 
and barns as their grandfathers before 
them. Everyone I speak with intends to 
leave their land to their children and 
leave it better than they found it. That 
goes way back to it being entrusted to 
their care. We all have that responsi-
bility. 
Between the use of cover crops, buff-
er strips, no-till farming, and minimal- 
till farming, more conservation prac-
tices than ever before are being used on 
Iowa’s 35 million acres of farmland. 
While Iowa farmers are continuing to 
feed our country and the world, they 
are also doing so with fewer inputs and 
better soil and water outcomes. 
Iowa farmers should be congratu-
lated; however, it seems like there is 
always a target on the backs of Iowa 
farmers and I could say for maybe all 
American farmers. I want to get to 
that target, and that has something to 
do with this map that I have here of 
the State of Iowa. 
Last week, it was reported that the 
Biden administration is moving for-
ward to add redtape to their operations 
by rewriting President Trump’s navi-
gable waters protection rule. In my 
first telephone conversation with then- 
EPA nominee Administrator Regan 
and 
now 
the 
confirmed 
Adminis-
trator—by the way, confirmed by a 
unanimous 
vote 
of 
this 
Senate—I 
warned Administrator Regan against 
moving back to the Obama-era waters 
of the U.S. rule, which we call WOTUS 
for short. That is a regulation they 
shouldn’t move back to because of the 
burden it placed on rural areas, includ-
ing Iowa farmers. 
In fact, under the old waters rule, 97 
percent of Iowa’s land would have been 
subject to jurisdiction under the Clean 
Water Act. In other words, all of the 
blue part of Iowa—with the exceptions 
of these areas that are white that adds 
up to the blue area—97 percent of this 
land mass of Iowa would be subject to 
Federal jurisdiction. Adding more Fed-
eral redtape to a farmer’s day-to-day 
decisions on the farm is government 
overreach, plain and simple. 
But besides Iowa’s 86,000 farmers, a 
change in the Trump navigable waters 
protection rule will also result in sig-
nificant redtape and significant ex-
pense for, among others, homebuilders, 
golf course managers, and construction 
companies as they make very routine 
decisions about how best to use the 
land and run their businesses. 
Now, imagine that, not only have 
new home prices risen due to inflation 
and soaring lumber prices—and, by the 
way, lumber prices have added $36,000 
to the price of a house just in the last 
year. Now, instead of that happening 
because lumber prices have gone up, 
now home prices, because of this pro-
posed change in the regulation, will in-
crease due to additional permitting 
that wasn’t previously needed. 
To clear up common confusion, the 
Trump-era rule that is now the law of 
the land did not give polluters free rein 
to discharge pollutions with no regard 
to the health of our Nation’s water-
ways. Regulating the discharge of pol-
lution into waterways is important and 
is done through other parts of the 
Clean Water Act. 
The Trump rule made sure that 
where routine land use decisions were 
being made with little or no environ-
mental impact, then those decisions 
would not be regulated by the Federal 
Government. EPA’s release about its 
intention to overturn the navigable 
waters protection rule, which is the 
Trump rule, mentions that 333 projects 
would have required permits by the 
Obama waters rule that did not need 
government paperwork under the navi-
gable waters protection rule of the 
Trump administration, and, of course, 
that is exactly the point—exactly the 
point of what was wrong with the 
WOTUS rule. 
If you are simply moving dirt to level 
off a low point in a field, should that 
need a Federal permit? If a golf course 
is fixing a bunker or flattening a green, 
should that need a Federal permit? The 
obvious commonsense answer to both 
of these questions and a lot of other 
questions that can be put out there for 
speculative purposes is, What good does 
this redtape do for anyone? I want to 
underline that point. 
My Republican colleagues and I want 
clean water and healthy soil for our 
families and our communities. This is 
important. But what I don’t want is a 
Federal Government power grab that 
adds so much redtape to routine land 
use decisions that it slows our econ-
omy to a halt. 
If the Biden administration decides 
to go down this road of reverting to the 
old Obama-era WOTUS, they will be se-
riously misguided. Why should you put 
the farmers of Iowa, as well as the 
other people, with many even having to 
get a permit to do normal farming 
practices—it just doesn’t make sense. 
For an administration that is so fo-
cused on updating our Nation’s infra-
structure, why does it make sense to 
propose a rule that only adds costs and 
delays construction with no identifi-
able benefit? 
I urge President Biden and EPA Ad-
ministrator Regan to listen to the 
farmers and land owners across the 
country. Wave the WOTUS rule good-
bye. Put away the redtape that is going 
to come around as a result of what you 
are planning to do. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4509 
June 14, 2021 
Unaccompanied children continue to 
arrive at our border by the tens of 
thousands. In the first 5 months of this 
year, more than 65,000 migrant children 
crossed our southern border—nearly 
double the amount we saw in fiscal 
year 2020. As bad as things are, things 
can, and I predict will, get worse. 
The 
administration 
is 
weighing 
whether this is an appropriate time to 
lift title 42, which is a public health 
order designed to protect from the 
spread of the COVID–19 virus, but they 
have yet to tell us what transition 
plans they may have, if any, in 
transitioning from the current exclu-
sion of many adult migrants to wel-
coming those who are currently ex-
cluded or processing them through our 
immigration courts. 
Depending on what the administra-
tion decides, the humanitarian crisis at 
the border will likely swell even larger 
this summer. Despite the clear need for 
action from Congress, most of our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
have put on blinders. Instead of a bi-
partisan effort to eliminate or, I should 
say, alleviate or mitigate the humani-
tarian and security crisis at our bor-
der, we have one side pushing for ac-
tion and the other side largely staying 
silent. 
The Judiciary Committee of the Sen-
ate should be leading the charge to ad-
dress this crisis in a fair and humane 
way. Back in April, Senator GRASSLEY, 
the ranking Republican, and I sent a 
letter to Chairman DURBIN and Sub-
committee Chairman PADILLA request-
ing a hearing of either the full com-
mittee 
or 
the 
Immigration 
Sub-
committee on this current crisis at the 
border. 
Two months and hundreds of thou-
sands of migrants later, they have sim-
ply refused to even hold a hearing. 
Last month, the Subcommittee on 
Border Security and Immigration held 
its first hearing, but the topic wasn’t 
on the border crisis. Instead, the topic 
was increased numbers of visas for un-
documented immigrant workers. That 
is a topic we can and should discuss but 
certainly not with the looming crisis 
on the border. 
Tomorrow morning, the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee will continue to ig-
nore this backlog of migrants and this 
blinking red light that should warn all 
of us that this crisis will get nothing 
but worse. 
What is the topic of tomorrow’s hear-
ing in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee? We are set to hold a hearing on 
the unserious, House-passed immigra-
tion bill. This legislation stands zero 
chance of being passed by the Senate— 
zero. It combines some of the most rad-
ical proposals from the far left in one 
massive bill that fails to address the 
needs of our country. Rather than dis-
cuss the humanitarian crisis at the 
border, our Democratic colleagues have 
chosen to hold a hearing on a dead-on- 
arrival bill, and they know it. It is a 
remarkable show of priorities. 
Tomorrow, I expect we will hear a lot 
about discussing the Deferred Action 
on Childhood Arrival recipients—one of 
the categories of undocumented immi-
grants that would receive a path to 
citizenship under this legislation. 
I should say that Texas is home to 
about 100,000 DACA recipients who are 
vital parts of our communities. They 
have grown up with our kids, attended 
the same churches, shopped in the 
same grocery stores, and defended our 
freedoms in the U.S. military. They are 
also a huge driver of our economy. 
Ninety-six percent of DACA recipients 
are either working or in school, and, on 
the whole, these young people con-
tribute more than $400 million a year 
in State and local taxes in Texas alone. 
Despite all the ways these young men 
and women strengthen our country and 
our communities, they have been living 
in a constant state of uncertainty 
about their future. That is because 
when President Obama announced this 
program 9 years ago, he did so through 
a shortsighted Executive memorandum 
rather than engage Congress. That is 
right. Rather than rolling up his 
sleeves and working with Congress to 
pass long-lasting immigration policy, 
he chose a path of least resistance that 
didn’t involve any input from Congress 
but merely created this with a stroke 
of a pen. To say the least, this made 
things easier for President Obama in 
the short run, but it caused a lot of 
fear—has caused a lot of fear and un-
certainty for these young people in the 
long run, and that continues today. 
They were set unfairly on a yearslong, 
tumultuous journey, waiting nervously 
to see how the courts would weigh in 
on the various court challenges that we 
knew were going to occur. President 
Obama knew it as well. So these young 
DACA recipients have been left won-
dering whether they might be deported 
to a country they have no memory of 
and being forced to leave behind the 
families, the jobs, and the opportuni-
ties they have worked so hard to build 
here in the United States. 
Many of these young people are in 
their twenties and thirties now with 
careers, families, and plans of their 
own. The possibility of being forced to 
leave the United States is no less terri-
fying for them than it would be for 
anyone who was born here. After years 
of being yanked around from court rul-
ing to court ruling, these young men 
and women deserve certainty. They de-
serve to know whether they can apply 
to college, grow their families, live 
their lives, and do all the things other 
young Americans can do without this 
dark cloud hanging over their plans. 
After all, they haven’t done anything 
wrong. They were brought here as chil-
dren, as minors. And in America, we do 
not hold children responsible for the 
mistakes of adults—in other words, 
their parents. 
That is why I believe we should take 
action that gives these DACA recipi-
ents the certainty they deserve, and 
the only way to do that is through 
more legislation, not further Executive 
actions. And I strongly support that 
legislative effort. However, massive 
partisan bills, like the legislation the 
House passed this year, is not the an-
swer. I support DACA recipients be-
cause they were brought here at a 
young age through no fault of their 
own, but the American Dream and 
Promise Act has completely abandoned 
this justification in favor of rewarding 
recent illegal entries with green cards, 
even adults who violated our immigra-
tion laws. 
If the goal is to provide legal cer-
tainty for our DACA recipients as op-
posed to making a grand political 
statement, we need to be realistic 
about how we get there. We need to 
learn from our mistakes of the past, 
where we have tried to build big, com-
prehensive immigration reform bills 
only to see them collapse of their own 
weight, which means we need to begin 
working on smaller packages that can 
gain broad support and hopefully build 
trust in the process. I am not sug-
gesting we quit there, but that is the 
place we need to start if we have 
learned from the lessons of the last 20 
years. 
The American people overwhelm-
ingly support allowing DACA recipi-
ents to remain in the United States, 
and I believe it is true of a majority of 
Members of the Senate. We have to set 
aside policies we cannot agree on so we 
can make progress on the ones we do 
agree on, and we need to keep our ef-
forts focused on DACA recipients. If 
this is a priority for folks on both sides 
of the aisle, I hope we will finally be 
able to get a bill to the President’s 
desk to help these young people. 
More broadly, though, there is no de-
nying our immigration system is sore-
ly in need of reform. It is outdated; it 
is inefficient; and it simply does not 
meet the needs of our country today. 
But there is very little room for those 
types of conversations until we solve 
the current crisis at the border. Once 
that is under control and our bipar-
tisan Border Solutions Act, which is 
the only bicameral, bipartisan bill that 
has been introduced—once we solve 
that problem, I hope we will have a bi-
partisan debate about the changes that 
should be made to our immigration 
system, and the DACA recipients are at 
the top of that list. 
As I said, these young men and 
women deserve certainty, and Congress 
cannot pass legislation to provide that 
certainty if our Democratic colleagues 
and the White House insist on attach-
ing controversial policies or ignoring 
the current crisis at the border, as the 
Biden administration is appearing to 
do. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Alabama.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4510 
June 14, 2021 
The United States of America re-
mains a beacon of strength and free-
dom. Generations of Americans pur-
chased this strength through blood, 
treasure, and self-sacrifice. We do not 
want to be the first generation of 
Americans to abandon that tradition, 
but we will unless we give our men and 
women in uniform the tools they need 
to do the job. 
The President’s proposed budget does 
not deliver for our military. In fact, it 
tells our military to do less every day 
than what they have in the past. Presi-
dent Biden’s budget proposal cuts 
money from the Department of Defense 
when accounting for inflation. I have 
said before that this budget is dis-
appointing, dangerous, and a disservice 
to our men and women in uniform. 
The President’s advisers surely know 
the threat our country faces. Here is 
what the Office of National Intel-
ligence said in its annual threat assess-
ment: The Chinese Communist Party 
will continue to undercut the United 
States, drive wedges between Wash-
ington and its allies and partners, and 
foster international norms that favor 
the authoritarian Chinese system. 
That is from the President’s own Di-
rector of Intelligence. But talk is 
cheap, and cheap talk is what we are 
getting because this budget does not 
rise to meet that threat. 
Question: Does the President not be-
lieve the dire warnings of his own ad-
visers? 
At the same time, President Biden 
and congressional Democrats’ policies 
are giving us a weak economy when it 
should be roaring. The last two job re-
ports fell way short of expectations. In 
April, economists expected 1 million 
jobs, but we only got one-fourth of 
that—25 percent. 
Democrats’ out-of-control spending is 
driving inflation to levels we haven’t 
seen 
in 
over 
a 
decade. 
President 
Biden’s own budget assumes policies 
will only lead to a weak 2-percent GDP 
growth—2 percent—when it should be 
double that amount. 
Democrats aren’t stopping at a weak 
military and a weak economy. They 
have put forth thinly veiled attempts 
to strip our country of what makes it 
so great. They want to undo our very 
system of federalism and local control 
by eliminating States’ right-to-work 
laws through the PRO Act. They want 
a Washington takeover of every State’s 
election laws through S. 1 or, as I like 
to call it, the corrupt politicians act. 
But worst of all, it is teaching our kids 
to hate our country. The Biden admin-
istration has embraced the divisive 
curriculum of critical race theory to 
rewrite history and paint the United 
States as a villain. 
Question: How can we expect the 
Biden administration to defend Amer-
ica’s ideals abroad if the President 
won’t even defend them at home? This 
isn’t Building Back Better. 
Teddy Roosevelt, another successful 
Republican 
President, 
always 
said: 
‘‘Speak softly and carry a big stick.’’ 
President Biden is certainly speaking 
softly all right, but he is whittling 
away our big stick down to a twig. 
We are already seeing the results. 
Weakness invites aggression. President 
Biden and his aides seem to believe 
that a return to the appeasement poli-
cies of the Obama administration and a 
rejection of President Trump’s policy 
of strength are the best way to ensure 
peace. That is going to be tough for 
them and for the American people. We 
are already seeing how these policies 
do not work. 
Take Palestine, for example. Just 2 
months ago, the President decided to 
send hundreds of millions of dollars in 
aid to the Palestinians. And I ask, For 
what reason? Why are we sending mil-
lions of dollars to Palestine at this 
time when we are having a tough point 
in our country with this pandemic? 
They just took American dollars and 
turned around and rained terror on our 
No. 1 ally in the Middle East, with 
thousands of rockets aimed at Israeli 
civilians. It triggered the worst fight-
ing between Israel and Hamas since 
2014. The President’s policy and mil-
lions of taxpayer dollars were wasted. 
They did nothing but arm Hamas. The 
President’s policy did not work. 
President Biden made no secret that 
he wanted to bring back the failed Iran 
nuclear deal that was the pride of 
President Obama’s second term. Well, 
Iran responded by supplying Hamas 
with those rockets to kill Israeli civil-
ians. Iran is also sending warships to 
help their socialist ally, Venezuela. 
Again, the President’s policies did not 
work. 
One of President Biden’s first acts in 
office was to cancel the Keystone Pipe-
line with our northern border neighbor 
in Canada. Yet the President is allow-
ing Russia to build the Nord Stream 2 
gas pipeline to Germany, further iso-
lating 
Ukraine 
from 
its 
Western 
friends. 
Russia 
has 
responded 
by 
amassing troops along the Ukraine bor-
der. Once again, the President’s poli-
cies did not work. 
The week after President Biden an-
nounced his skinny budget proposal 
with no increase to the Department of 
Defense, China sent a record number of 
fighter jets into the Taiwanese air-
space. That is a clear pattern that the 
President’s policies aren’t working, 
and they are emboldening our enemies. 
The fallout from the Biden adminis-
tration’s weaknesses isn’t just limited 
to far-off countries across the sea, we 
are seeing the very real cost at our 
southern border. The Biden administra-
tion refuses to take this crisis seri-
ously. The number of illegal immi-
grants crossing the border this fiscal 
year is already the most since 2006, and 
there are 4 months left to go. 
In May of this year alone, Customs 
and Border Protection apprehended 
more than 180,000 illegal immigrants 
along the southern border. And it is 
not just folks coming from Central 
America. According to the CBP, there 
have been at least 59,000 illegal immi-
grants apprehended who were not from 
Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, or 
Honduras. 
They are from as many as 90-plus 
countries, as far away as Bangladesh, 
Ghana, and Nepal. 
And the problem is that it is not just 
people seeking a better life. Customs 
and Border Protection reports that 
they have arrested 95 convicted sex of-
fenders attempting to enter the United 
States since the beginning of the fiscal 
year, and those are just the ones that 
are being caught. 
Biden, 2 months ago, said: ‘‘What’s 
wrong with 2 million illegal immi-
grants?’’ 
So what the Biden administration is 
doing is they are not stemming the 
tide. President Biden threw his hands 
up and put Vice President HARRIS in 
charge. 
Has she visited the border since she 
has been put in charge? No. 
She thinks her words, ‘‘Don’t come,’’ 
are enough to stop the flood of illegal 
immigrants. Well, they are not. Her 
words are too late and too little. 
I 
remember 
how 
then-Candidates 
Biden and HARRIS pushed back against 
President Trump for wanting to secure 
the border, for wanting to enforce our 
immigration laws as written, and folks 
across the globe were listening. They 
heard the rhetoric. They packed their 
bags, and they made the dangerous 
journey. 
They took then-Candidates Biden and 
HARRIS at their word. It is why so 
many illegal immigrants wear T-shirts 
saying: ‘‘Biden, let us in.’’ 
Why would they listen to her saying 
‘‘Don’t come’’ now? 
But here is what really got me. When 
asked why she hasn’t gone to the bor-
der to see the crisis for herself, Vice 
President HARRIS laughed and said: ‘‘I 
haven’t been to Europe’’ either. I 
couldn’t believe what I was hearing. We 
need leadership, not a tourist. 
Well, Madam Vice President, I have 
been to the border, and I have seen how 
dangerous it is for these people coming 
here. I have actually listened to our 
Border Patrol agents, who talk about 
how the cartels really run things and 
how they have total control of the U.S. 
southern border. I have seen how many 
drugs are pouring across the border be-
cause our law enforcement is too busy 
processing illegal immigrants instead 
of catching the bad guys. 
But I sat beside a teenager leaving 
McAllen, TX, on the flight to Houston. 
She had her new 3- or 4-month-old 
baby. She was being sent on a plane by 
the Biden administration to Houston 
and then on the way to Denver, not 
knowing what she was to expect when 
she got there. 
It is not easy to see. It certainly 
wasn’t for me. But that is the price of 
being in a position of power, to be able 
to do something about the problems 
facing the people and our country. The 
Vice President needs to see the human 
cost of the policies she and the Presi-
dent are supporting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4511 
June 14, 2021 
Ladies and gentlemen, peace is only 
possible when the United States is 
strong. That means a strong military, 
a strong economy, a strong educational 
system, and a strong border. 
Unless we reverse our course soon, it 
will be too late to stop the violence and 
aggression President Biden’s weakness 
has invited across the globe and here at 
home. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, of 
the District of Columbia, to be United 
States Circuit Judge for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. President, I rise today to offer a 
resolution expressing support for the 
Pledge of Allegiance as a historic and 
significant expression of patriotism. 
By the way, I did the same thing last 
year. 
In 2002, 19 years ago, Senator Tom 
Daschle raised a similar resolution 
with unanimous support from the Sen-
ate, and it passed on the floor unevent-
fully, without amendment. 
In a few days, this body can choose to 
do the same, to reaffirm our support 
for the Pledge of Allegiance. 
I rise today, too, to honor a Hoosier 
who understood the innate value of the 
Pledge of Allegiance to civic education. 
In 1969, Red Skelton, the American 
comedian and entertainer who was 
well-known for his program on CBS, 
‘‘The Red Skelton Hour,’’ wrote a 
speech 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Pledge. Reflecting on his time in Vin-
cennes, a neighboring community to 
where I live, he spoke about the value 
instilled by one of his high school 
teachers in the words of the Pledge of 
Allegiance. 
After the performance of the speech, 
CBS received several hundred thousand 
requests for copies. The speech would 
go on to be sold as a single by Colum-
bia Records and performed at the 
White House for President Nixon. 
I think it would be an honor to Mr. 
Skelton’s memory and to the impor-
tance of the Pledge of Allegiance if it 
were recited today on the Senate floor 
in the words of Red Skelton. 
When I was a small boy in Vincennes, [In-
diana,] I heard, I think, one of the most out-
standing speeches I ever heard in my life. I 
think it compares with the Sermon on the 
Mount, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, and 
Socrates’ Speech to the Students. 
We had just finished reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance, and he [Mr. Lasswell, the Prin-
cipal of Vincennes High School] called us all 
together, and he says, ‘‘Uh, boys and girls, I 
have been listening to you recite the Pledge 
of Allegiance all semester, and it seems that 
it has become monotonous to you. Or, could 
it be, you do not understand the meaning of 
each word? If I may, I would like to recite 
the pledge, and give you a definition of each 
word: 
I—Me, an individual; a committee of one. 
Pledge—Dedicate all of my worldly good to 
give without self-pity. 
Allegiance—my love and my devotion. 
To the Flag—Our standard. ‘‘Old Glory’’; a 
symbol of courage. And wherever she waves, 
there is respect, because your loyalty has 
given her a dignity that shouts ‘‘Freedom is 
everybody’s job.’’ 
Of the United—That means we have all 
come together. 
States—Individual communities that have 
united into 48 great states; 48 individual 
communities with pride and dignity and pur-
pose; all divided by imaginary boundaries, 
yet united to a common cause, and that’s 
love of country— 
Of America. 
And to the Republic—a Republic: a sov-
ereign state in which power is invested into 
the representatives chosen by the people to 
govern; [us] and the government is the peo-
ple; and it’s from the people to the leaders, 
not from the leaders to the people. 
For which it Stands 
One Nation—Meaning ‘‘so blessed by God.’’ 
Indivisible—Incapable of being divided. 
With Liberty—Which is freedom; the right 
of power for one to live his own life without 
fears, threats, or any sort of retaliation. 
And Justice—The principle and qualities of 
dealing fairly with others. 
For All—For All. That means, boys and 
girls, it’s as much your country as it is mine. 
Afterwards, Mr. Lasswell asked his 
students to recite the Pledge of Alle-
giance together, with newfound appre-
ciation for the words. 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United 
States of America, and to the Republic, for 
which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with 
liberty and justice for all. 
Mr. Red Skelton concluded his speech 
by saying: 
Since I was a small boy, two states have 
been added to our country, and two words 
have been added to the Pledge of Allegiance: 
[If you listened closely] ‘‘Under God.’’ 
Wouldn’t it be a pity if someone said, ‘‘That 
is a prayer’’—and that be eliminated from 
our schools . . . ? 
Just as those students that day, Mr. 
Skelton included, recommitted to the 
meaning of the words of the Pledge of 
Allegiance, I call upon the U.S. Senate 
to recommit to the meaning of these 
words. 
There are times today that the words 
of the pledge are tossed around without 
too much care. Other times, they are 
altered 
to 
remove 
what 
today 
is 
deemed offensive or antiquated. But 
Americans should not misuse or abuse 
our Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge of 
Allegiance is meant to remind Ameri-
cans of our guiding principles and in-
spire adherence to those ideas which 
make 
our 
country 
great: 
equality 
under the law, recognized rights to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
This is why today I am requesting that 
in a few days we pass this resolution 
with unanimous consent, and I am 
hopeful that occurs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
VOTE ON BROWN JACKSON NOMINATION 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the vote 
begin immediately on the nominee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Brown Jackson 
nomination? 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask for the yeas

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

OFFICER

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise for the eighth time to call 
for this entire body to have the oppor-
tunity to vote on and consider the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act. 
This commonsense reform would en-
sure that people in the military who 
have been subjected to sexual assault 
and other serious crimes get the justice 
they deserve. 
I ask for this vote because I want to 
ensure that this important reform, 
which is backed by a bipartisan fili-
buster-proof majority of the Senators, 
becomes law. If we leave this debate 
and this reform to the national defense 
authorization 
committee 
review, 
I 
have no doubts that that will not hap-
pen. 
We all know how a bill becomes a 
law. It passes the Senate and the 
House, and is signed by the President. 
And we all know how this process can 
be subverted. We have seen popular 
provisions that have passed both the 
House and the Senate be minimized, 
watered down, or removed in con-
ference altogether. And I have cer-
tainly seen good proposals killed be-
hind closed doors of the NDAA markup. 
In 2019, I introduced a much smaller 
reform called Safe to Report. That pro-
vision was designed to improve report-
ing rates by allowing survivors of sex-
ual assault to report the assault with-
out fear of retaliation in the form of 
misconduct charges for related minor 
offenses, things like underage drinking 
or breaking a curfew. 
That commonsense reform, which 
could have allowed more survivors to 
come forward, passed in both the House 
and the Senate, but it was removed in 
conference. We had to reintroduce the 
very same bill the following year in 
order for it to be included and become 
law in the next year, the fiscal year 
2021 NDAA. 
If a program focused solely on help-
ing to make it easier for survivors to 
report their assault was removed in 
conference, I have little reason to be-
lieve that this once-in-a-generation re-
form will survive. 
Given the lack of progress we have 
made on sexual assault in the military 
and the entrenched problems with the 
military justice system, we cannot 
allow this widely supported reform to 
be left to the whims of those working 
behind closed doors in conference—a 
process with a rich history of sub-
verting reforms on behalf of the De-
partment of Defense. Let us have this 
vote in the Senate, and let us send it to 
the House to become law. 
Every day we delay this vote is an-
other day we deny justice to the sur-
vivors of sexual assault. We deny jus-
tice to servicemembers who have been 
affected by serious crimes. We deny 
justice to the men and women who do 
so much for this country. We owe it to 
them to not wait another minute 
longer. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader, in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate Committee on Armed 
Services be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate 
proceed to its consideration; that there 
be 2 hours for debate, equally divided 
in the usual form, and that upon the 
use or yielding back of that time, the 
Senate vote on the bill with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, reserv-
ing my right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, like 
the Senator from New York, I believe 
that we should transfer crimes regard-
ing sexual misconduct to a special 
prosecutor, as the Senator of New York 
has outlined, and that is a decision 
that many of my colleagues have made 
over the last few months. In the past, 
they have been opposed, as I have op-
posed that approach. 
The difficulty is the transfer of other 
crimes like burglary, arson, financial 
mismanagement, misappropriation of 
government funds or properties. Those 
issues have not been carefully studied, 
and they should be studied, and that is 
the purpose of the committee. 
We will take this up. We will study it 
very closely. We will also look at some-
thing that I think has to be looked at 
seriously: How do we implement this 
reform, and how much time do we 
need? The last time that we made a 
major change to the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice, we allowed the De-
partment of Defense 2 years, and they 
took all of it. The present legislation 
would allow 18 months. This is some-
thing we have to look at. 
We also have to look at the resources 
that are needed. This involves a change 
in the structure of the military legal 
system, and the committee is a place 
where we will get the best views of peo-
ple who have dedicated themselves in 
the Senate to thinking hard and thor-
oughly about issues of military justice, 
issues of military preparedness, and all 
of these things. 
Looking forward to a debate, but 
looking also forward to, I think, what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4513 
June 14, 2021 
is becoming increasingly secure—the 
transfer of responsibility for sexual as-
sault and crimes of that nature to an 
independent prosecutorial approach—it 
is something I think that we can an-
ticipate going forward. 
And with that, I would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, there are several reasons why I 
disagree strongly with the chairman. 
First of all, this is not a complex re-
form. In fact, only one thing changes: 
After the military police conclude 
their investigation, instead of the case 
file being handed over to the com-
mander’s JAG, the case file is handed 
over to the prosecutor, who might 
eventually have gotten that case any-
way. The prosecutor reviews the case 
file and decides whether or not to pros-
ecute. 
If he decides not to prosecute, he will 
send it back to the commander. Only 3 
percent of commanders have this job; 
97 percent of commanders’ jobs will not 
be affected by this change. And then 
they will get to do what they typically 
do, which is to review the case; per-
haps, ask for nonjudicial punishment 
for related crimes; perhaps, do a spe-
cial court-martial. That sits with the 
commander. 
The second reason why I disagree 
with the chairman is that if you re-
move only one crime from the com-
mander, you will essentially create an 
entirely different system just for sur-
vivors of sexual assault, who are more 
often to be women who report those 
crimes. Even though males suffer more 
from sexual assault, they just don’t re-
port them, and that, therefore, will be-
come a special court for women serv-
icemembers. And experts have said 
that it will further marginalize them, 
it will further diminish them, it will 
further alienate them. It will be a spe-
cial court for women, or a ‘‘pink 
court.’’ 
Third, this reform has already taken 
place in the countries of our allies. The 
UK did it over 10 years ago for defend-
ants’ rights. Israel did it over 40 years 
ago. Canada, Netherlands, Australia, 
Germany—all 
have 
taken 
serious 
crimes out of the chain of command. 
And in each of those instances, they 
have said it has not reduced good order 
discipline, and it has not had any im-
pact on command and control. 
And so the truth is that this is a 
change whose impact will be to give 
survivors of sexual assault and any sur-
vivor of a serious crime the confidence 
that the military justice system is un-
biased and highly trained. 
The other reason why this change is 
so necessary to be a bright line at all 
serious crimes is defendants’ rights. 
And I can tell you that we now have 
data developed in 2017 from Protect 
Our Defenders, a report that says that 
it is up to 2.5 times more likely for 
Black and Brown servicemembers to be 
punished than White servicemembers. 
That is a shocking statistic—a shock-
ing statistic. 
So I believe that if you create a 
bright line at serious crimes, you will 
not only improve the system for sur-
vivors of sexual assault but for all liti-
gants—plaintiffs and defendants—and 
you will protect the civil liberties and 
civil rights of Black and Brown service-
members from a defendant’s rights per-
spective. 
The committee has had 8 years to de-
bate, discuss, have hearings, and pass 
legislation. We have passed nearly 250 
bills on this topic. They have lost their 
sole jurisdiction over this issue. They 
have failed to improve sexual assaults 
in the military, and it is now time for 
an up-or-down vote, which has 66 co-
sponsors in this body. It is now time 
for an up-or-down vote on our bill. It 
should no longer be the purview of the 
NDAA and the Armed Services Com-
mittee because they have been unwill-
ing to have a vote on this for over 5 
years and unwilling to take a serious 
look at how to fix these injustices 
within our military. 
Our military servicemembers deserve 
a military justice system worthy of the 
sacrifices they make every day.

UNEQUIVOCALLY 
CONDEMNING 
THE 
RECENT 
RISE 
IN 
ANTISEMITIC 
VIOLENCE 
AND 
HARASSMENT TARGETING JEW-
ISH AMERICANS, AND STANDING 
IN SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE AF-
FECTED BY ANTISEMITISM 
Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I rise 
today as cochair of the Senate Bipar-
tisan Task Force for Combating Anti- 
Semitism, which just relaunched this 
week with over half the Senate as 
Members. I am speaking out because 
Jewish-Americans and Jews across the 
globe are in danger. 
They are in danger because we are 
experiencing a worldwide surge in anti- 
Semitic hate crimes and violence. In 
communities 
across 
America, 
Jews 
have been threatened, they have been 
verbally accosted, and brutally as-
saulted. 
Anti-Semitism has long been the ca-
nary in the coal mine of hatred. His-
tory teaches us that when anti-Semi-
tism takes hold, democracy itself is 
imperiled. This issue has reared its 
ugly head in recent years, particularly 
in the past month. 
According to the ADL, anti-Semitic 
incidents in May were double what 
they were during the same period last 
year. Over the past few weeks, we have 
seen horrendous attacks on Jewish 
communities. In New York, fireworks 
were hurled at a crowd of Jewish- 
Americans. In Los Angeles, Jewish din-
ers were attacked. 
One response I saw to a recent dese-
cration of a synagogue in Arizona has 
stuck with me. The response said ‘‘the 
amount of Jewish hate isn’t shocking. 
The silence is.’’ 
Those who committed these egre-
gious acts wanted to send a message. 
They wanted to say that Jews have no 
place here. And it is critical that we 
send a clear and forceful message back. 
We must ensure that our elected lead-
ers, Democrats and Republicans, are 
resolute in affirming that there is zero 
tolerance for anti-Semitism. 
We must honor the words of George 
Washington, who wrote to the Jewish 
community of Rhode Island in 1790, 
that America ‘‘gives to bigotry no 
sanction, to persecution no assist-
ance,’’ which is why I urge the Senate 
to immediately take up my bipartisan 
resolution condemning the recent anti- 
Semitic incidents, unconditionally and 
unequivocally. 
I am calling on leaders to take spe-
cific steps—specific steps—to address 
and prevent them, including having the 
President nominate and the Senate 
confirm a qualified Ambassador to 
monitor and combat anti-Semitism, 
fully 
implementing 
my 
bipartisan 
Never Again Education Act to advance 
Holocaust education, having agencies 
improve their collection of anti-Se-
mitic hate crime data, and sufficiently 
funding the Nonprofit Security Grant 
program to protect houses of worship 
and community centers from violence. 
I want to thank Senator LANKFORD 
and his staff for their work in helping 
to pass this resolution, which currently 
has 74 cosponsors. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration and 
the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 252. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 252) unequivocally 
condemning the recent rise in antisemitic vi-
olence and harassment targeting Jewish 
Americans, and standing in solidarity with 
those affected by antisemitism, and for other 
purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Ms. ROSEN. I know of no further de-
bate on the measure. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, there is, Madam 
President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam 
President. First, let me thank Senator 
ROSEN. She has been a valiant, strong 
and unrelenting fighter against anti- 
Semitism—not just today with this 
wonderful resolution, but every day, 
and we thank her for her leadership, 
her tremendous and needed leadership 
on this issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4514 
June 14, 2021 
I want to thank Senator LANKFORD as 
well in joining Senator ROSEN
in 
crafting this bipartisan resolution be-
cause, as we all know, anti-Semitism is 
not a partisan issue. So I very much 
appreciate the way that they have 
worked together across the aisle to 
bring this resolution forward. 
It is essential that we come together 
at this moment. Over the past few 
years, America has once again seen the 
pernicious, poisonous, and dangerous 
rise of hate crimes. In recent weeks in 
particular, anti-Semitism—the oldest 
hatred—has dramatically spiked. It, 
too, just like every other hate crime, is 
pernicious, poisonous, and dangerous. 
We are all horrified by the anti-Se-
mitic attacks in New York, around the 
country, and around the globe. 
So I join my colleagues tonight to 
say unequivocally that this hatred 
must be called out, confronted, and 
stopped. And the Senator from Nevada 
has an excellent series of proposals to 
help make that happen. 
Anti-Semitism must be combated 
wherever and whenever it rears its ugly 
head. It is vile, it is reprehensible, and 
it is counter to everything America 
stands for: freedom of religion, equal-
ity, and respect for the dignity of every 
person. 
For too long—too long—we have seen 
it. And yet in the past, America has al-
ways been a refuge for the oppressed; a 
land of promise, opportunity, and tol-
erance for people from all corners of 
the world who came here in search of a 
better life. It was true for my family 
and for many others, and hopefully, it 
will continue to be. 
But that noble purpose has too often 
been marred by periods of isolationism, 
xenophobia, and racial intolerance. We 
live in a time where we must actively 
work to rekindle the light of tolerance 
that has kept anti-Semitism at bay 
here in the United States and around 
the globe. 
As majority leader, the first Jewish- 
American to hold that honor, I will 
work with any and all of my colleagues 
to face down anti-Semitism and every 
other form of racial or religious dis-
crimination. 
I strongly urge the Senate to stand 
united against anti-Semitism, and I am 
very grateful to pass this resolution 
unanimously. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
If not, the question is on agreeing to 
the resolution. 
The resolution (S. Res. 252) was 
agreed to. 
Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the preamble 
be agreed to and that the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in the RECORD of May 27, 2021, 
under ‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) 
Ms. ROSEN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum.

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate consider the following nomination:

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Michal Ilana Freedhoff, of 
Maryland, to be Assistant Adminis-
trator for Toxic Substances of the En-
vironmental Protection Agency. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nomination. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate vote on the nomi-
nation without intervening action or 
debate, and if confirmed, the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, all without intervening 
action or debate; that no further mo-
tions be in order to the nomination, 
that any statements related to the 
nomination be printed in the RECORD, 
and that the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Freedhoff nom-
ination? 
The nomination was confirmed.

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
section 36(b) of the Arms Export Con-
trol Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–42 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AH–64E Apache Attack Helicopter is 
the 
Army’s 
advanced 
attack 
helicopter 
equipped for performing close air support, 
anti-armor, and armed reconnaissance mis-
sions. The aircraft contains the following 
sensitive communications and target identi-
fication equipment, navigation equipment, 
aircraft survivability equipment, displays, 
and sensors: 
a. The AN/ARC–231 Ultra High Frequency 
(UHF) radio is a software defined radio for 
military aircraft that provides two-way 
multi-mode voice and data communications. 
It provides joint service standard line of 
sight (LOS), HAVE QUICK, SATURN, and 
SINCGARS electronic counter-counter meas-
ures (ECCM), along with integrated wave-
form satellite communications (SATCOM). 
b. The AN/APX–123A Identify Friend-or- 
Foe (IFF) digital transponder set provides 
pertinent platform information in response 
to an IFF interrogator. The digital trans-
ponder provides cooperative Mark XII IFF 
capability using full diversity selection, as 
well as Mode Select (Mode S) capability. In 
addition, transponder operation provides 
interface capability with the aircraft’s Traf-
fic Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS). 
The transponder receives pulsed radio fre-
quency interrogation signals in any of six 
modes ( 1, 2, 3/A, S, and 5), decodes the sig-
nals, and transmits a pulse-coded reply. The 
Mark XII lFF operation includes Selective 
Identification Feature (SIF) Modes 1, 2, 3/A 
and C, as well as secure cryptographic Mode 
5 operational capability. 
c. Link 16 Datalink is a military tactical 
data link network. Link 16 provides aircrews 
with enhanced situational awareness and the 
ability to exchange target information to 
Command and Control (C2) assets via Tac-
tical 
Digital 
Information 
Link-Joint 
(TADIL–J). Link 16 can provide a range of 
combat information in near-real time to U.S. 
and allies’ combat aircraft and C2 centers. 
The AH–64E uses the Harris Small Tactical 
Terminal (SIT) KOR–24A to provide Airborne 
and Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) Small 
Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) capa-
bility. The SIT is the latest generation of 
small, two-channel, Link 16 and VHF /UHF 
radio terminals. While in flight, the SIT pro-
vides simultaneous communication, voice or 
data, on two key waveforms. 
d. The AN/APR–39 Radar Warning Receiver 
Signal Detecting Set is a system that pro-
vides warning of a radar directed air defense 
threat 
and 
allows 
appropriate 
counter-
measures. This is the 1553 databus compat-
ible configuration. 
e. The AN/AVR–2B Laser Warning Set is a 
passive laser warning system that receives, 
processes and displays threat information re-
sulting from aircraft illumination by lasers 
on the aircraft’s multi-functional display. 
f. The AAR–57 Common Missile Warning 
System (CMWS) detects energy emitted by 
threat missile in-flight, evaluates potential 
false alarm emitters in the environment, de-
clares validity of threat and selects appro-
priate counter-measures for defeat. The 
CMWS consists of an Electronic Control Unit 
(ECU), 
Electro-Optic 
Missile 
Sensors 
(EOMSs), and Sequencer and Improved Coun-
termeasures Dispenser (ICMD). 
g. The AH–64E uses two EAGLE+MMR em-
bedded GPS/Inertial navigation systems with 
Multi-Mode Receiver. The EAGLE+MMR is a 
self-contained, all-attitude navigation sys-
tem with embedded GPS receiver, controlled 
via MIL–STD–1553B controller, providing 
output navigation and GPS timing data to 
support ADS–B out and other platform sys-
tems. The EAGLE’s EGI unit houses a 24 
channel GPS receiver which is capable of op-
erating in either Standard Positioning Serv-
ice (SPS) C/A-code (non-encrypted) or Pre-
cise 
Positioning 
Service 
(PPS) 
Y–code 
(encrypted). The Eagle+ MMR is pending air-
craft testing and air worthiness rating 
(AWR) approval, with flight tests anticipated 
to start in April 2021. AWR approval is ex-
pected prior to the proposed sale to Aus-
tralia. 
h. The AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target Ac-
quisition and Designation Sight/AN/AAQ–11 
Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MTADS/PNVS) 
provides day, night, limited adverse weather 
target information, as well as night naviga-
tion capabilities. The PNVS provides ther-
mal imaging that permits nap-of-the-earth 
flight to, from, and within the battle area, 
while TADS provides the co-pilot gunner 
with search, detection, recognition, and des-
ignation by means of Direct View Optics 
(DVO), television, and Forward Looking In-
frared (FLIR) sighting systems that may be 
used singularly or in combinations. 
i. The AN/APR–48B Modernized Radar Fre-
quency Interferometer (M–RFI) is an updated 
version of the passive radar detection and di-
rection finding system. It utilizes a detach-
able UDM on the M–RFI processor, which 
contains the Radar Frequency (RF) threat li-
brary. 
j. The AN/APG–78 Longbow Fire Control 
Radar (FCR) with Radar Electronics Unit 
(REU) is an active, low-probability of inter-
cept, millimeter wave radar. The active 
radar is combined with a passive Radar Fre-
quency Interferometer (RFI) mounted on top 
of the helicopter mast. The FCR Ground Tar-
geting Mode detects, locates, classifies and 
prioritizes stationary or moving armored ve-
hicles, tanks and mobile air defense systems 
as well as hovering helicopters, helicopters, 
and fixed wing aircraft in normal flight. If 
desired, the radar data can be used to refer 
targets to the regular electro-optical Mod-
ernized Target Acquisition and Designation 
Sight (MTADS).

platform communication and teaming be-
tween Apache, unmanned aerial systems 
(UAS), and other interoperable aircraft and 
ground platforms. It provides the ability to 
display real-time UAS sensor information 
and MTADs full motion video feeds across 
MUM–T equipped platforms and ground sta-
tions. 
l. The M299 Missile Launcher, commonly 
known as the Longbow Hellfire Launcher 
(LBHL), is a four rail launcher designed to 
carry the complete family of AGM–114 
Hellfire missiles. 
m. The AGM–114R Hellfire is a semi-active 
laser guided missile with a multi-purpose 
warhead that can engage and defeat both 
high and heavily armored targets, personnel, 
bunkers, caves and urban structures. 
n. The Hellfire M36E9 Captive Air Training 
Missile (CATM) is a flight-training missile 
that consists of a functional guidance sec-
tion coupled to an inert missile bus. It func-
tions like a tactical missile during captive 
carry on the aircraft, absent launch capa-
bility, making it suitable for training the 
aircrew in simulated Hellfire missile target 
acquisition and lock. 
o. The M261 2.75 Inch Rocket Launcher is a 
nineteen tube, three zone rocket launcher 
utilized on heavy attack aircraft. It is used 
to fire the Hydra 70 2.75 inch rocket, an 
unguided, fin-stabilized air-to-ground rocket 
that utilizes a variety of warhead and fuze 
combinations to achieve a range of effects. 
p. The AGR–20A Advanced Precision Kill 
Weapons System (APKWS) is a conversion of 
the 2.75 inch Hydra 70 rocket which adds a 
laser guidance kit to enable precision tar-
geting. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Government of Australia can provide sub-
stantially the same degree of protection for 
the sensitive technology being released as 
the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary 
in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Australia.

UNITED STATES INNOVATION AND 
COMPETITION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, on 
Tuesday, June 8, 2021, the U.S. Senate 
passed the U.S. Innovation and Com-
petition Act of 2021. This comprehen-
sive legislation includes the Endless 
Frontier Act as Division B. The End-
less Frontier Act will establish a new 
Directorate of Technology and Innova-
tion at the National Science Founda-
tion, NSF, focused on research and de-
velopment in 10 key technology focus 
areas, which include ‘‘biotechnology, 
medical 
technology, 
genomics, 
and 
synthetic biology.’’ 
Although the NSF funds minimal re-
search involving human embryos, it is 
absolutely critical for the proposed 
new Directorate of Technology and In-
novation and the NSF as an institution 
to protect human life and to prohibit 
research that would create or destroy 
human embryos. First enacted in 1996, 
the Dickey-Wicker amendment incor-
porated 
into 
annual 
appropriations 
bills ensures that such protections 
apply to research funded by the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, NIH. 
The NSF reports that it applies all 
NIH guidelines, including the Dickey- 
Wicker amendment, to its research. 
The Chief of Government Affairs at 
NSF, Mr. Robert Moller, confirmed this 
in an email to my staff dated May 16, 
2021: 
NSF supports very little human embryonic 
stem cell research. NSF incorporates the 
NIH Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Re-
search through our award Terms and Condi-
tions, which govern, among other things, the 
allowable uses for NSF funds. Those NIH 
guidelines clearly address the Dickey Wicker

amendment in Section V. As NSF incor-
porates this guidance, it also incorporates 
the Dickey-Wicker amendment and its re-
strictions. 
It is clear from NSF’s response and a 
review of the research terms and condi-
tions that are binding on awardees that 
NIH 
guidelines, 
including 
Dickey- 
Wickery protections, apply to NSF- 
funded research. Since nothing in the 
Endless Frontier Act or the U.S. Inno-
vation and Competition Act modifies 
these legal protections, it is therefore 
the clear intent of the Senate that the 
protections for human life afforded by 
the Dickey-Wicker amendment con-
tinue to apply to the NSF.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
100TH STATE ANNUAL SINGING 
CONVENTION 
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Madam President. I rise 
today in recognition of the 100th anni-
versary of the State Annual Singing 
Convention in Benson, North Carolina. 
The Sing will be celebrating its cen-
tennial June 25 to 27, 2021 in the Ben-
son Singing Grove with some of the 
biggest 
names 
in 
southern 
gospel 
music. Local choirs, gospel groups, and 
recording artists from near and far will 
be sharing their talents and memories 
of the Sing throughout the years. 
Prior to 1921, choirs would assemble 
on fifth Sundays in early summer to 
sing in Benson. Whether in an open 
field or under a brush arbor, large 
crowds would come to hear these glo-
rious choirs. Mr. Simon Honeycutt, a 
regular attendee, conceived of the idea 
for a singing convention and reached 
out to four other men—Mr. T.C. Miller, 
Mr. J.B. Raynor, Mr. J.V. Barefoot, and 
Mr. J.H. Rose—to help organize the 
event. The first State Annual Singing 
Convention was held in a tobacco ware-
house in 1921. A silver cup was awarded 
to the best all-around group, along 
with prizes for the best quartette and 
duet. Impartial judges had to be found 
from a great distance away, and picnic 
baskets filled a table 110 feet in length 
as 200 people came to enjoy the wonder-
ful singing. 
After a fire destroyed the tobacco 
warehouse in 1922, a new location for 
the Sing was found in an oak-shaded 
grove at the center of town. This land 
was donated by Miss Catherine Benson, 
a member of the family for which the 
town is named. In its early years, a 
temporary stage was constructed and 
lumber stacked on pine blocks served 
as seating, These materials were bor-
rowed from a local sawmill and re-
turned at the conclusion of the Sing. 
permanent stage in the center of the 
grove was dedicated in 1950, thanks to 
town merchants and patrons of the 
Singing Convention. Folding chairs 
have now replaced the early lumber-on- 
block 
seating. 
The 
Singing 
Grove 
would fill to capacity long before the 
singing started as people reunited with 
old friends and relatives, caught up on 
the latest news, and forgot about their 
worries as their souls were lifted 
through song. For those not able to at-
tend in person, local radio stations al-
lowed listeners to tune in and for a 
time, the State Annual Singing Con-
vention was broadcast to a national au-
dience. 
As the joy-filled weekend wound to 
an end, singers and spectators alike 
anxiously 
awaited 
judges 
tallying 
scores and winners being announced in 
several different categories. The people 
have changed, but the Sing remains be-
cause of a steadfast commitment to 
what it represents. As an early leader 
once wrote, ‘‘The multitude of voices 
blend in ‘God be with you till we meet 
again’ to reassure the world that there 
will always be a song of love in the 
hearts of God’s people everywhere. 
That is the faith of the State Annual 
Singing Convention.’’ 
It is my honor to commemorate this 
notable centennial. The State Annual 
Singing onvention has nurtured count-
less souls through song and is a testa-
ment to the faith of those who carry on 
its legacy. I extend my congratulations

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. LEE (for himself and Mr. 
GRASSLEY): 
S. 2039. A bill to improve the anti-
trust laws, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today 
to introduce a piece of legislation 
called 
the 
Tougher 
Enforcement 
Against Monopolists Act, or the TEAM 
Act. I am grateful that my good friend 
and ranking member of the Judiciary 
Committee, the senior Senator from 
Iowa, CHUCK GRASSLEY, has joined me 
as a cosponsor of the bill. 
Now, I am aware that our House col-
leagues just recently introduced sev-
eral bills intended to fight anti-com-
petitive conduct by Big Tech. Those 
bills, in my view, don’t go far enough. 
America is facing a panoply of com-
petition concerns not just in Big Tech 
but across the entire economy. We need 
a holistic approach that benefits all 
consumers, in every industry. We need 
to deal with all the monopolists hurt-
ing competition. 
Even worse, the House bills not only 
have too small of a target, but they use 
too big of a sledgehammer to hit it. 
They create a truly massive expansion 
of Federal regulatory power and are 
the first steps toward a command-and- 
control economy. 
Responding to Big Tech with Big 
Government is adding insult to injury, 
not to mention something I doubt any 
conservative will be able to support. 
We don’t need a bigger government. We 
need to make the one we have work 
better. 
The TEAM Act avoids each of these 
mistakes. Instead of a narrow focus 
and Big Government approach, this bill 
will improve Federal antitrust enforce-
ment for the entire economy without 
making government bigger. 
The TEAM Act improves antitrust 
law in two ways. The first is putting all 
of our antitrust enforcers on one team. 
The TEAM Act unites our two Federal 
antitrust enforcement Agencies into 
one. For over a century, American 
antitrust enforcement has been some-
thing of a two-headed creature some-
times at odds with itself. The results 
have been delays to enforcement and 
consumer redress, uncertainty for busi-
nesses, and even conflicting antitrust 
enforcement policy. 
Just recently, the two Agencies actu-
ally argued against each other on oppo-
site sides of an appeal before the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
This arrangement isn’t working for 
anyone—anyone, that is, perhaps, ex-
cept corporations looking for an oppor-
tunity to game the system. 
I hope that the bill can also put our 
two parties on the same team when it 
comes to antitrust reform. Our present 
reform movement is filled with bipar-
tisan fervor to improve the lives of our 
constituents by improving competition 
in the markets that serve them and 
protecting them from the monopolists 
that exercise so much unearned power 
over huge swaths of our economy. Now, 
we don’t agree on everything, but we 
do agree on this. It is my sincere belief 
that this bill represents the best and, 
hopefully, most bipartisan path for-
ward. 
That brings me to the second focus of 
the bill: preventing antitrust harm by 
monopolists. I use the term ‘‘antitrust 
harm’’ here very deliberately. In cer-
tain corners of the antitrust policy 
world, it has become fashionable to 
talk of being pro-monopoly or anti-mo-
nopoly, which is often tied to being 
pro- or anti-democracy. That is also de-
liberate terminology, and I think it is 
dangerous. It is a sleight of hand 
meant to move the conversation away 
from specific conduct and whether that 
conduct harms competition, to do so 
regardless and to instead imply that all 
that matters in this context, in this in-
quiry, is size and whether you support 
or defend a business based on its size. 
That position is both unserious and 
economically indefensible. Even the 
briefest, most passing moment of re-
flection on this will demonstrate its 
absurdity. 
If you are anti-monopoly, are you 
also anti-patent? Patents are, after all, 
government-granted monopolies. The 
entire purpose of the patent is to allow

June 14, 2021 
its holder to exclude competition for a 
limited period of time and charge the 
highest price that the market will 
bear. But we allow this because the 
prospect of collecting monopoly profits 
acts as an incentive to innovate and in-
vest in new ideas. 
The same principle is at work in mar-
ket monopolies. The prospect of ob-
taining a monopoly through competi-
tion on the merits incentivizes com-
petitors to offer consumers better prod-
ucts and services at lower prices. This 
free market system built on competi-
tion and innovation is responsible for 
many of the great achievements of 
mankind and the economic flourishing 
of the greatest civilization the world 
has ever known. 
But even more important is the 
foundational principle of our Republic 
that the law deals with conduct, not 
status. We punish people for what they 
do, not who they are. ‘‘Big is bad’’ 
abandons that fundamental American 
principle of law. Instead, the facile in-
sistence on being simply ‘‘anti-monop-
oly’’ belies the proponents’ true prior-
ities. It means being anti-business even 
when it hurts consumers. It is the eco-
nomic version of cutting off your nose 
to spite your face. 
The ‘‘big is bad’’ philosophy is also 
part of a broader effort to overturn the 
consumer welfare standard. This crit-
ical component of U.S. antitrust law 
has been widely misunderstood, often 
as a result of willful misrepresentation. 
The consumer welfare standard does 
not protect monopolists. It does not 
mean the government loses, and it is 
decidedly not limited to a narrow focus 
on prices. 
Rather, the consumer welfare stand-
ard is a statement about the over-
arching goals of antitrust law; namely, 
that the purpose of antitrust is to ad-
vance the economic welfare of con-
sumers as opposed to protecting the 
competitors themselves or advancing 
unrelated social policies. 
As I note in my introduction to the 
new edition of ‘‘The Antitrust Par-
adox,’’ Judge Robert Bork himself ex-
plicitly described the consumer welfare 
standard as being broader than an in-
quiry into price, and it is one that cer-
tainly includes an inquiry into quality, 
innovation, and consumer choice. In 
other 
words, 
whatever 
consumers 
value, that is what is captured by 
‘‘consumer welfare.’’ 
But it is much easier to argue 
against the consumer welfare standard 
by pretending that it only cares about 
lower prices and, therefore, is incapa-
ble of addressing consumer harm in 
markets with free products, such as 
many online services. This misrepre-
sentation says a lot about the true 
goals of the so-called anti-monopoly 
crowd. If they really cared about the 
nonprice facets of competition, they 
wouldn’t need to abandon the con-
sumer welfare standard to promote it. 
But that isn’t their true goal. 
The real problem they have with the 
consumer welfare standard is the way 
that it constrains judges from advanc-
ing unrelated policy goals. It turns out 
the push to abandon the consumer wel-
fare standard is not about stopping mo-
nopolies or helping consumers. It is 
simply a Trojan horse for woke social 
policy. 
Now, a proper application of the anti-
trust laws does have political bene-
fits—what Utah’s State constitution 
refers to as ‘‘the dispersion of economic 
and political power’’—but those are 
secondary benefits. Antitrust is not 
primarily a political tool. 
If a company acquires market power 
as a result of competing on the merits, 
then any influence that flows from 
that will, at least, be a result of con-
sumer choices. Just as citizens vote at 
the ballot box, consumers vote at the 
checkout aisle. But if that market 
power is obtained or grown through ne-
farious or anti-competitive means, the 
resulting market power is illegitimate 
and a threat to the Republic, which 
leads to the point that, of course, many 
monopolies are bad. They are genu-
inely bad. 
These are those monopolies obtained 
or prolonged not through competition 
on the merits but through anti-com-
petitive and exclusionary conduct. This 
conduct obstructs rather than facili-
tates the natural operation of the free 
market, using raw market power to 
prevent consumers from making opti-
mal choices and then starving them of 
lower prices, higher quality, and new 
offerings. 
Competitive conduct benefits both 
businesses and consumers. Anti-com-
petitive conduct only helps the monop-
olist. 
Unfortunately, there have been at-
tempts to defend some anti-competi-
tive conduct. This is most often done 
through the use of speculative and con-
voluted economic models that claim to 
predict the future, almost always pre-
dicting that a merger or specific con-
duct won’t actually harm competition. 
We have, sadly, seen an overcorrec-
tion from the days lamented by Judge 
Bork when courts and enforcers ig-
nored basic economic analysis. Now 
‘‘the age of sophists, economists, and 
calculators has succeeded,’’ and our 
antitrust enforcement efforts are fre-
quently hampered by what Judge Bork 
called an ‘‘economic extravaganza.’’ 
The result has been that some conduct 
and mergers that should have been con-
demned have instead escaped much 
needed scrutiny. 
All of this is why the TEAM Act cat-
egorically rejects the Manichean belief 
that big is always bad, while still ac-
knowledging that concentrated eco-
nomic power can be just as dangerous 
as concentrated political power, and, in 
fact, one often leads to the other. In 
this way, it embraces antitrust laws as 
sort of federalism for the economy, and 
it does so by focusing not on mere size 
but on antitrust harm; that is, whether 
something actually harms consumers 
by harming competition. 
The bill strengthens our ability to 
prevent and correct antitrust harm in 
three ways. 
The TEAM Act strengthens the anti-
trust laws. It includes a market share- 
based merger presumption, improves 
the HSR Act, codifies the consumer 
welfare standard, and makes it harder 
for monopolists to justify or excuse 
anti-competitive comment. 
The TEAM Act strengthens antitrust 
enforcers. In addition to consolidating 
Federal antitrust enforcement at the 
Department of Justice, the bill also in-
cludes a version of the Merger Filing 
Fee Modernization Act, introduced by 
Senators KLOBUCHAR
and GRASSLEY. 
Most significantly, the bill roughly 
doubles the amount of money appro-
priated to Federal antitrust enforce-
ment, ensuring that our antitrust en-
forcers have all the resources they need 
to protect American consumers. 
The TEAM Act strengthens anti- 
trust remedies. The bill repeals Illinois 
Brick and Hanover Shoe to ensure that 
consumers are able to recover damages 
from anticompetitive conduct. Even 
more significantly, the bill allows the 
Justice Department to recover trebled 
damages on behalf of consumers and 
imposes civil fines for knowingly vio-
lating the antitrust laws. 
Now, I believe these reforms reflect 
the best way to strike the balance of 
protecting competition and consumer 
welfare, while limiting government 
intervention in the free market. In an 
era in which would-be monopolists 
want to move fast and break things, it 
is essential that our antitrust enforc-
ers are empowered to move fast and 
break them up. 
This is the prudent and the conserv-
ative approach. Better antitrust en-
forcement means less regulation and 
thus smaller government. 
This is also a wiser approach than at-
tempting to statutorily prohibit cer-
tain categories of conduct. That ap-
proach abandons one of the greatest 
strengths of American antitrust law: 
the fact-specific nature of every in-
quiry. 
Case-by-case 
adjudication 
is 
what allows us to maximize enforce-
ment while minimizing false positives. 
The TEAM Act avoids the black-and- 
white pronouncements of other legisla-
tive proposals and instead updates the 
mechanics of how the antitrust laws 
are applied to address the enforcement 
gaps of recent decades. 
As I have said before, we find our-
selves at a critical moment. The threat 
to competition and free markets is 
real. Doing nothing is not an option. At 
the same time, we simply cannot allow 
the need to ‘‘do something’’ to push us 
into embracing bad policy that will 
have 
unintended 
consequences 
and 
push America closer to a government- 
regulated economy. 
I look forward to working closely 
with my colleagues and with friends on 
both sides of the aisle and at both ends 
of the Capitol in order to advance the 
TEAM Act and help protect American 
consumers.

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
Ms. 
HASSAN, 
Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, 
Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND, 
and 
Mr. 
KING): 
S. 2047. A bill to ban the use of inten-
tionally 
added 
perfluoroalkyl 
or 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances 
in 
cos-
metics; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the No PFAS in 
Cosmetics Act. I am pleased to be 
partnering with Senator BLUMENTHAL 
on this important legislation. Our bi-
partisan bill seeks to ban the inclusion 
of Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS) in cosmetics products, such as 
make-up, moisturizer, and perfume. 
PFAS are a class of man-made 
chemicals, 
which 
includes 
PFOA, 
PFOS, and GenX. These chemicals can 
bioaccumulate in our bodies over time 
and have been linked to cancer, thyroid 
disease, liver damage, decreased fer-
tility, and hormone disruption. First 
developed in the 1940s, PFAS are tradi-
tionally 
found 
in 
food 
packaging, 
nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and 
firefighting foam. 
Unfortunately, 
Maine 
has 
experi-
enced considerable PFAS contamina-
tion, which has not only threatened 
our water supply, but adversely af-
fected the livelihoods of farmers. Sev-
eral dairy farms in Maine recently dis-
covered serious levels of PFAS in their 
operations, with milk containing as 
high as 1,420 parts per trillion. This is 
more than twenty times EPA’s estab-
lished health advisory level for drink-
ing water. 
In addition to these agricultural and 
water supply contaminations, we now 
also know that PFAS appear in prod-
ucts across the spectrum—including 
cosmetics. A new peer-reviewed study 
led by the University of Notre Dame 
published in Environmental Science 
and Technology Letters found high flu-
orine levels—indicating the probable 
presence of PFAS—in just over half of 
231 makeup products tested, including 
waterproof mascara, liquid lipsticks, 
and foundations. 
A subset of 29 samples was studied 
further 
to 
identify 
specific 
PFAS 
chemicals. Between four and 13 specific 
PFAS were identified in each of the 29 
samples, some at high concentrations. 
Remarkably, only one of these 29 prod-
ucts listed any fluorochemical ingredi-
ents on the product’s label. While some 
of these PFAS may be present in trace 
quantities as impurities in the manu-
facturing process, those found at high 
concentrations are likely being used 
intentionally to impart performance 
characteristics to the product. Since 
fluorinated chemicals are not disclosed 
on the labels, this study suggests that 
consumers unknowingly are being ex-
posed to PFAS in their cosmetics. 
The findings of this study are par-
ticularly alarming, as many of these 
products are subject to direct human 
exposure. For example, lipstick is often 
inadvertently ingested, and mascara is 
sometimes 
absorbed 
through 
tear 
ducts. In addition, during the cosmetic 
product manufacturing process, work-
ers are exposed to the chemicals that 
are used, and discarded products with 
PFAS can cause the potential for addi-
tional human exposure if drinking 
water sources are contaminated. 
PFAS pose an unnecessary and avoid-
able risk to human health and do not 
belong in our cosmetic products. The 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
defines cosmetics as ‘‘articles intended 
to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or 
sprayed on, introduced into, or other-
wise applied to the human body . . . for 
cleansing, 
beautifying, 
promoting 
attractiveness, or altering the appear-
ance.’’ This definition includes skin 
moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fin-
gernail polishes, eye and facial makeup 
preparations, cleansing shampoos, per-
manent waves, hair colors, and deodor-
ant, as well as other similar products. 
Our legislation would direct the FDA 
to issue a proposed rule banning the in-
tentional addition of PFAS in cos-
metics, as defined by the FDA, within 
270 days of enactment, and require a 
final rule to be issued 90 days there-
after. 
The FDA should act now to ban the 
addition of PFAS to cosmetics prod-
ucts to help protect people from fur-
ther contamination. I urge all of my 
colleagues to join me in supporting the 
No PFAS in Cosmetics Act.

Mr. CRAPO, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. SCOTT of 
South Carolina, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. 
RISCH, Mr. KING, Mr. GRASSLEY, Ms. 
SMITH, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. LUJA´ N, Ms. COL-
LINS, and Ms. KLOBUCHAR) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry: 
S. RES. 268 
Whereas the United States dairy industry 
serves as a key driver in the national food 
system and supports the people of the United 
States both nutritionally and economically; 
Whereas the 2020–2025 United States Die-
tary Guidelines for Americans finds that 
healthy dietary patterns feature dairy prod-
ucts, as such products provide essential nu-
trients which keep the people of the United 
States healthy and serve as a leading source 
of— 
(1) calcium, which helps maintain strong 
bones and aids in heart function; and 
(2) vitamin D, which aids in calcium ab-
sorption; 
Whereas the 2020–2025 United States Die-
tary Guidelines for Americans finds that 
some products sold as ‘‘milks’’ made from 
plants may be consumed as a source of cal-
cium, but most plant products are not nutri-
tionally similar to milk from dairy cows; 
Whereas the 2020–2025 United States Die-
tary Guidelines for Americans provides daily 
recommendations for key age groups, includ-
ing— 
(1) 3 cup-equivalents of dairy products for 
pre-teens, teenagers, and adults; 
(2) 21⁄2 cups for children 4 to 8 years of age; 
and 
(3) 2 cups for children 2 to 4 years of age; 
Whereas studies have shown that following 
these daily recommendations leads to im-
proved bone health and reduced risk of— 
(1) osteoporosis, which is a condition where 
bones become more fragile over time and 
more prone to fractures; and 
(2) cardiovascular diseases, which are a 
group of disorders of the heart and blood ves-
sels that lead to heart attacks and strokes 
and are among the leading causes of death in 
the United States; 
Whereas individuals who are lactose intol-
erant can choose low-lactose and lactose-free 
dairy products; 
Whereas 42 percent of individuals in the 
United States are below their estimated av-
erage requirement for calcium intake, and 94 
percent are below such requirement for vita-
min D intake; 
Whereas a global study of more than 
136,000 adults from 21 countries found that 
consuming at least 2 servings of dairy prod-
ucts per day is associated with lower risk for 
heart disease, stroke, and death; 
Whereas the annual all-inclusive expense 
of providing care for osteoporotic fractures 
among Medicare beneficiaries was an esti-
mated $57,000,000,000 in 2018, and is expected 
to increase to over $95,000,000,000 by 2040; 
Whereas, when broken down by individual, 
in the year following a fracture, all-cause 
health care costs exceeded $30,000, of which 
an average of $3,000 was paid by the patient; 
Whereas Congress authorized dairy prod-
ucts as eligible foods under the special sup-
plemental nutrition program for women, in-
fants, and children program under section 17 
of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 
1786), which safeguards the health of low-in-
come women, infants, and children up to age 
5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nu-
tritious foods to supplement diets; 
Whereas Congress authorized the supple-
mental nutrition assistance program under 
the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 
2011 et seq.), which helps low-income work-
ing families, low-income seniors, and people 
with disabilities access nutritious foods, in-
cluding dairy products; 
Whereas the United States–Mexico–Canada 
Agreement provided new opportunities and 
continued supporting the access of high- 
quality United States products to 2 valuable 
export markets; 
Whereas dairy production efficiently and 
affordably 
provides 
essential 
nutrients, 
while only contributing to 1.3 percent of the 
greenhouse gas emissions of the United 
States; 
Whereas, between 1944 and 2007, the United 
States dairy industry produced 59 percent 
more milk and reduced its carbon footprint 
by 63 percent with 79 percent fewer cows; 
Whereas, in 2020, the average dairy cow in 
the United States produced 23,777 pounds (or 
44,463 cups) of milk per year, an increase of 
11.5 percent from 2011; 
Whereas milk is produced in all 50 States 
on 31,657 licensed dairy farms, with Cali-
fornia, Wisconsin, Idaho, New York, and 
Texas serving as the top 5 producers, pro-
ducing 53 percent of the United States’ dairy; 
and 
Whereas the United States dairy industry 
directly 
and 
indirectly 
provides 
$753,000,000,000 in total economic impact to 
the United States and supports 3,300,000 jobs: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of June 2021 as 
‘‘National Dairy Month’’ to recognize— 
(A) the important role dairy plays in a 
healthy diet; 
(B) the exceptional work of dairy producers 
in being stewards of the land and livestock; 
and 
(C) the economic impact of the United 
States dairy industry; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to visit with dairy producers to learn 
more about agriculture and the vital role 
dairy producers play in our global food sys-
tem.

HONORING HUNTINGTON’S 
AMERICAN LEGION POST 7 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Huntington’s American Legion 
Post 7 as they prepare to celebrate their 100th 
anniversary. 
American Legion Post 7 is one of the oldest 
posts in Indiana. Over the last century, their 
work has been invaluable in providing life- 
changing assistance and guidance for vet-
erans, military personnel and their families. 
Founded in June 1921, the post’s mission 
became only more important with time. 
Since Post 7’s inception, Americans fought 
in World War 11, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Af-
ghanistan and elsewhere. Each time liberty’s 
defense required the service and sacrifice of 
American patriots, our soldiers, sailors, airmen 
and marines were there to answer the call. 
Post 7—and other posts like it—have an-
swered the equally important call to serve 
those who served us upon their returning 
home. 
From selling poppies in May of each year in 
honor of America’s fallen to taking part in local 
Veterans Day’s parades, to hosting golf tour-
naments to raise proceeds for veterans to 
holding commemorations on days like Sep-
tember 11, and more, Hoosiers thank Amer-
ican Legion Post 7 for their selfless work. 
This is a testament to the Post’s longevity 
and achievement, for which Huntington, and 
northeast Indiana, is grateful.

CONGRATULATING AMANDA CAMP-
BELL ON BEING AWARDED THE 
HUSKY 100 
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Amanda Campbell, from Battle Ground, Wash-
ington on being awarded the Husky 100 from 
the University of Washington. 
The University of Washington Husky 100 
program recognizes 100 undergraduate and 
graduate students from all campuses and all 
areas of study who are making the most of 
their time at the university. Recipients of the 
Husky 100 are successfully connecting what 
happens inside the classroom to the outside, 
helping make a difference on campus, in their 
communities, and in the future—and Amanda 
is no exception. 
Amanda is pursuing her Doctor of Pharmacy 
at the University of Washington School of 
Pharmacy. Amanda has been a leader, a 
strong researcher, and a patient advocate dur-
ing her studies. As a pharmacist, she hopes to 
break down the barriers of health care through 
health equity and literacy. Her current activi-
ties and goals for her future are exactly why 
Amanda was given this recognition. 
Once again, I want to congratulate Amanda 
on receiving this honor and I wish her the best 
of luck in her future endeavors.

HONORING KRYSTAL HAMLIN 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious community advocate, Ms. Krystal

GOOD TROUBLE 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ananya Vel, an 8th grade 
student 
from 
St. 
Bernadette 
School 
in 
Northborough, Massachusetts. 
Ananya recently won the Worcester County 
Bar Association’s Annual Law Day Essay Con-
test which sought to honor Congressman John 
Lewis by asking: what does ‘‘Good Trouble’’ 
mean to you—today? 
John was a great man, but more impor-
tantly, he was a very good man. He was a 
champion for justice and equality who chal-
lenged the conscience of our country and 
called America to a higher standard. 
John believed in Good Trouble and that all 
of us must find the moral courage to get in the 
way and do something when we see some-
thing is wrong. I am humbled to have worked 
alongside him, and I know he would be proud 
of Ananya’s words today. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratu-
late Ananya and include in the RECORD her 
award-winning essay: 
On December first, 1955, what started out 
as an ordinary evening in Montgomery Ala-
bama, turned into something else. When a 
42–year old African American woman took a 
seat on a bus and wouldn’t give up her seat 
for a white man, she started something. 
Some might say she started trouble. Others 
might say she did something good, in stand-
ing up for herself. But in that moment, that 
ordinary evening turned into a night that 
would go down in history as the night Rosa 
Parks was arrested for refusing to vacate her 
seat for a white passenger. Which is why still 
others may say that she both caused trouble, 
and did something good. 
The phrase, ‘‘Good Trouble’’ may seem like 
an oxymoron, seeing as the two words have 
opposite definitions. The dictionary defines 
the word ‘‘good’, as ‘‘to be desired or ap-
proved of and the word ‘‘trouble’’ as ‘‘dif-
ficulty or problems’’ or ‘‘public unrest or dis-
order.’’ But if you look deeper, beyond a 
combination of definitions and into the true 
meaning, you’ll see that ‘‘Good Trouble’’ is a 
lot more than just an oxymoron. 
I believe, good trouble is knowing when to 
bend the rules, and when to break them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E634 
June 14, 2021 
When trapped in a moral dilemma, it’s 
choosing the ethical choice over the lawful 
one. It’s defining your principles and stick-
ing to them, no matter what. We all have a 
set of rules in our heads that we follow based 
on what we think is right. We all have lines 
that we draw to keep ourselves in check. But 
too often, we break rules and cross lines in 
order to dance to the tunes of others. 
Good trouble is a right choice, and a cir-
cumstance. In America we have the right to 
speak our minds, but we also have the choice 
to use that right. We will only have to make 
that choice is the circumstance requires it. 
America has counted on good trouble to get 
to where it is today. It has brought about 
most change in our country. In 1920 women 
got the right to vote thanks to the Nine-
teenth Amendment. If it weren’t for all the 
protests and rallies and brave people who 
stood up for what they believed in, that may 
not have happened. 
In the U.S Constitution, the First Amend-
ment is freedom of speech. It gives us the 
right to protest laws we feel are unjust, and 
the right to speak up for ourselves. Good 
trouble is making good use of this right and 
speaking out when the necessity arises. Good 
trouble is also not abusing this right and 
doing whatever you want. But oftentimes 
people get caught up in the moment and es-
calate into violent mobs. When peaceful pro-
tests tum into riots, the ‘‘Good’’ part of 
‘‘Good Trouble’’ is lost. 
Life is full of choices and sometimes there 
is not right or wrong one. We make about 
thirty-five thousand decisions per day, so 
making a choice is nothing new, but how do 
we know when to choose good trouble? Fol-
low your instinct, think about things others 
may not, and heed your conscience when it 
tells you something doesn’t feel right. That 
doesn’t mean you can break any rules you 
don’t feel like following. But there are times 
where you should not just go along with ev-
erything. Times when what you are doing 
feels wrong. These are the times when you 
should fight back. 
Our lives are shaped by luck, risk, and cir-
cumstance. The last one especially deter-
mines every decision we will ever make. 
Good trouble is a situation we willingly put 
ourselves in, seeking change. But you can 
only change what needs to be changed, which 
means you shouldn’t go out looking for dis-
order. Good trouble only exists because cir-
cumstance has demanded it. 
We all have thought in our heads that 
something is unfair or unreasonable. But the 
question you must ask yourself is, ‘‘What 
have I done to change that?’’ It’s easy to 
think something inside your head, but it 
takes courage to actually do something 
about it. People like Rosa Parks and Martin 
Luther King Jr. were people who were will-
ing to sacrifice a lot for what they believed 
in. But their efforts paid off when segrega-
tion was outlawed in the United States. 
Good trouble fits into our daily lives but it 
also fits into activism. Like anything, good 
trouble has a spectrum and you must ask 
yourself where’re you fall on it. The bigger 
the action, the more drastic the results. The 
more effort you put in, the more change you 
will see. 
Sometimes there are moments when your 
conscience seems to launch into a civil war. 
Good trouble is where the two sides find 
common ground. It is the compromise be-
tween the devil and the angel. Good trouble 
is knowing when to jump fences and duck 
under barriers. But it’s also knowing when 
not to. ‘‘Be the change you wish to see in the 
world,’’ is a popular quote that fits right in 
with the meaning of good trouble today. The 
question isn’t ‘‘what’s wrong?’’ it’s ‘‘What 
are you doing to fix it?’’ 
HONORING JEFF OLSON AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jeff Olson, a community pharmacist at 
Montross Pharmacy, as this week’s Iowan of 
the Week. Since 1995, Jeff has been the 
owner and operator of Montross Pharmacy in 
Winterset, Iowa, which this year is celebrating 
its 100th anniversary. 
If you were to ask Jeff what it means to be 
a community pharmacist, he’d emphasize one 
word: community. Every day, Jeff works to 
make sure nobody goes without the care they 
need—whether that means fielding questions 
at the pharmacy counter, delivering prescrip-
tions at home, or supporting local health as 
president of the Madison County Health Trust. 
Community pharmacies like Montross Phar-
macy are mainstays and integral parts of the 
health care system in our small towns. 
When COVID–19 forced us to adapt to dif-
ferent daily routines, Jeff and his staff at 
Montross Pharmacy redoubled their commit-
ment to serving Winterset. They knew the 
pandemic presented a once-in-a-lifetime chal-
lenge, but they resolved to get through it to-
gether. Together, Montross Pharmacy kept its 
doors open, providing continued access to 
pharmacy services for residents in a safe set-
ting. Jeff and his staff were on call 24/7. And, 
trust me, if there were more than 24 hours in 
a day to give, they’d have been there. 
They also quickly added new services for 
the 
community, 
including 
thousands 
of 
COVID–19 tests and vaccinations. It wasn’t al-
ways easy. When faced with a vaccine short-
age, Jeff took it upon himself to drive six 
hours to secure more doses for his friends 
and neighbors. His hard work did not go unno-
ticed. In fact, one resident—an older woman 
who had been homebound during the pan-
demic—exclaimed to Jeff that the vaccine he 
administered was ‘‘the best gift she could re-
ceive.’’ 
Jeff and his family have made a lasting 
mark on Winterset. Decades ago, Jeff’s grand-
father left his mark by welding on the cupola 
of the Madison County Courthouse. 
Today, Jeff is leaving a different kind of 
mark. In each COVID–19 vaccination he deliv-
ers, Jeff sees the things that make Winterset 
his home—a summer day enjoyed at the pool, 
a youth sports game, and his kids laughing 
over lunch with friends. 
Jeff’s selflessness is truly infectious, and I 
know that Winterset will see the impact of his 
hard work for years to come. I am sincerely 
grateful for Jeff’s commitment to his family, 
friends, and neighbors, and it is my honor to 
recognize Jeff Olson as Iowan of the Week.

CONGRATULATING 
NADIA 
SIDDIQUI 
ON 
BEING 
AWARDED 
THE HUSKY 100 
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Nadia Siddiqui, from Vancouver, Washington 
for being awarded the Husky 100 from the 
University of Washington. 
The University of Washington Husky 100 
program recognizes 100 undergraduate and 
graduate students from all campuses and all 
areas of study who are making the most of 
their time at the university. Recipients of the 
Husky 100 are successfully connecting what 
happens inside the classroom to the outside, 
helping make a difference on campus, in their 
communities, and in the future—and Nadia is 
no exception. 
Nadia recently received her Bachelor of 
Science in Bioengineering with a minor in Bio-
ethics from the University of Washington. 
Nadia hopes to use bioengineering and bio-
ethics to expand health care access through 
policymaking and outreach. Her activities on 
campus and goals for her future are exactly 
why Nadia was given this recognition. 
Once again, I want to congratulate Nadia on 
receiving this honor and I wish her the best of 
luck in her future endeavors.

HONORING 
QUITMAN 
COUNTY 
SCHOOL 
DISTRICT 
SUPER-
INTENDENT 
DR. 
EVELYN 
WILKERSON JOSSELL 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor remarkable 
public servant, Dr. Evelyn W. Jossell. 
Raised in Dublin and Clarksdale (Coahoma 
County) Mississippi, Dr. Jossell, born on Sep-
tember 4, 1958, is the sixth child of the late 
John and Annie Wilkerson. Dr. Jossell credits 
her passion for serving and working with peo-
ple to her humble beginnings on a small farm 
in Dublin, Mississippi, where she was taught 
early to share and treat everyone as she de-
sired to be treated. 
Dr. Jossell attended and graduated as Salu-
tatorian of Coahoma Agricultural High School 
in Coahoma County (1976). Next. she at-
tended Coahoma Junior College where she 
graduated with an AS. Degree in General 
Business (1980). After completing her studies 
at Coahoma, Dr. Jossell attended Mississippi 
Valley State University where she graduated 
Magna Cum Laude in 1980, with a B.S. in 
Business Administration. At the age of 21, Dr. 
Jossell worked a short while at the Mississippi 
State Penitentiary and was later hired as a 
Social Worker with the Coahoma County De-
partment of Human Services. Dr. Jossell 
worked as a Child Protective Social Worker 
with the Coahoma County Department of 
Human Services for 12 years. This profession 
revealed the abject neglect and abuse many 
young people are subjected to, even before 
they stepped out of their homes to enter a 
school building. With a desire to use her skills 
to change the trajectory of high-risk youth, Dr. 
Jossell attended the University of Mississippi 
and obtained a master’s degree in Counseling 
(1990). She was hired the same year by 
Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU), a newly 
funded federal program operating under the 
auspices of Coahoma Community College. 
This program offered a second chance oppor-
tunity for pregnant and parenting teens and

other high school dropouts who had a desire 
to re-enter the system and complete their high 
school education. Dr. Jossell served as Teen 
Parent Counselor/Coordinator for two years 
and was later promoted to Principal/Director of 
the Y.O.U. Alternative Education Program. At 
this time, the program was operated in con-
junction with the Quitman County School Dis-
trict. With this new appointment, Dr. Jossell re-
ceived Certification in Educational Administra-
tion in 1994 from the University of Mississippi, 
and her Doctorate in Education in 2012 from 
Walden University in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
After federal funds ended in support of the 
Y.O.U. Program in 1994, Dr. Jossell re-orga-
nized the program as a Community-Based 
Nonprofit to diversify the program’s funding 
streams. Over the 26-year lifespan of Y.O.U., 
Dr. Jossell wrote and submitted grants gar-
nering over 14 million dollars in Federal and 
State Grants focusing on education, health, 
mentoring, recreation and physical fitness 
services for high risk youth. As a result of 
these programs, several students received 
their G.E.D. were able to travel outside of the 
county (many for the first time) to professional 
football and basketball games; participated in 
organized youth sports programs; participated 
in male and female mentoring programs; and 
participated in Service Learning/School-to-Ca-
reer projects that provided leadership skills 
and career exposure. Some of Y.O.U.’s alumni 
are principals, assistant principals, entre-
preneurs, superintendents, doctors, educators, 
nurse practitioners, and more importantly, sev-
eral decided to return to Quitman County to 
work as professionals in the county that em-
braced them as youth. 
In January 2015, Dr. Jossell was given an 
assignment, that she believes was an appoint-
ment by God to run for Superintendent of Edu-
cation. She strongly believes that every career 
path God had previously placed her on, pro-
vided the experience and fortitude she would 
need to be an effective Superintendent. Guid-
ed by the Holy Spirit, and with a platform tout-
ing transformation change, Dr. Jossell was 
elected as Superintendent of Education in Au-
gust 2015 and took office January 2016. In a 
period of two years, the Quitman County 
School district went from an ‘‘F’’ accountability 
rating to a ‘‘C’’ performance rating. In 2018, 
the district’s only elementary school was as-
signed an ‘‘A’’ accountability rating, the first in 
the history of the school system. Inclusive with 
improving their academic standing, the school 
district also went from a 76.9 percent gradua-
tion rate in 2016 to a 95.5 percent graduation 
rate in 2020, ranking them with the 6th highest 
graduation rate out of 448 high schools in the 
state. The district ranked 9th in the State with 
the lowest dropout rate, and 3rd in the State 
with the highest number of Special Service 
students graduating with a standard diploma. 
Dr. Jossell is quick to give Glory to God for 
this success, and recognition to an amazing 
Board, Administration, Faculty and Staff who 
truly believe that excellence is not an event, 
but an everyday practice that can be achieved 
regardless of their zip code. 
Dr. Jossell’s greatest cheerleader is her 
husband of 41 years, Pastor Michael E. 
Jossell. Together they have built a life of ser-
vitude to their family, church, and community. 
They are the proud parents of 5 adult children: 
Dr. Endre’ Matthews; John S. Jossell, Michael 
E. Jossell, Jr., Jason D. Jossell, and Dr. An-
drea 
M. 
Jossell; 
three 
beautiful 
grand-
daughters-Mckenzie Faith, Ava Grace, Olivia 
Joy and a grandson due in September. 
Dr. Jossell is a Silver Star Member of the 
Iota Delta Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Evelyn W. Jossell for 
her dedication to serving this great community 
and state.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF JAMES 
CLIFTON CLARK, JR. 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life of James Clifton 
Clark, Jr. of Sumpter Township, Michigan who 
passed away on June 7, 2021. His life of hon-
orable service to our community is worthy of 
commendation. 
Mr. Clark was born on September 24, 1942 
to James and Marion Clark in Detroit, Michi-
gan. The eldest of ten children. he studied en-
gineering and earned a master’s degree from 
Wayne State University. After completing his 
education, he went on to work at the head-
quarters of Ford Motor Company where he 
worked as a Quality Manager for 44 years. 
A dedicated member of his community, Mr. 
Clark served his neighbors in Sumpter Town-
ship in countless ways. He served for years as 
Sumpter Township Building Inspector, on the 
Planning Commission, and on the Zoning 
Board of Appeals. Along with his father, he 
wrote the first ordinance for Sumpter Town-
ship. At the time of his passing, Mr. Clark was 
serving as Sumpter Township’s Treasurer. 
Mr. Clark was a trusted colleague and friend 
to many. He skillfully balanced his career, was 
committed to public service, and ensured he 
gave plenty of family time. Mr. Clark was 
known for being the family handyman and has 
built churches throughout the state of Ohio 
and built homes in the state of Michigan. No-
tably, he built the Clubhouse at Holiday West 
Mobile Home Community with the help of his 
family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of James Clifton Clark 
Jr., he was a dedicated public servant, a lov-
ing father, grandfather, uncle, and a friend to 
many. He will be deeply missed. Our thoughts 
are with his wife Toni, children Jim, Loni, Me-
lissa, Lisa, and Alisa, and his grandchildren, 
nieces, and nephews at this time.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
HARRY MELANDER 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished career of 
Harry Melander on the occasion of his retire-
ment as President of the Minnesota Building 
and Construction Trades Council. During his 
more than four decades of union leadership 
and public service, Harry has made a lasting 
impact through his work on behalf of Min-
nesota’s working families. Additionally, Harry 
has represented the interests of Minnesotans 
through his service as a member of the Metro-
politan Council, Federal Reserve Bank of Min-
neapolis Board, the St. Paul Port Authority 
Board, and the Washington County Planning 
Commission, among other community leader-
ship roles. 
Harry began his career as a union carpenter 
in 1973 and quickly rose as a leader on behalf 
of his fellow labor brothers and sisters, be-
coming president the Carpenters Local 87 
Union. Later he became a business represent-
ative for the St. Paul Building Trades Council, 
then executive secretary in 1997. Harry fo-
cused his work on building relationships 
throughout the community. Reaching out to 
elected officials, business and community 
leaders and developers, he cultivated relation-
ships that are still present today, ultimately in-
creasing the number of jobs for Building 
Trades union members. 
After becoming Executive Secretary of St. 
Paul Building Trades in 2005, Harry was soon 
faced with the monumental challenge of navi-
gating the industry through the economic col-
lapse of 2008 when some crafts lost up to 70 
percent of their work. But thanks in large part 
to Harry’s advocacy and work to build partner-
ships with the Minnesota Congressional Dele-
gation, state leaders and the City of Saint 
Paul, the industry was able to keep working 
on major public projects including the restora-
tion of Saint Paul’s Union Depot as the Twin 
Cities’ multimodal transit hub and construction 
of the Green Line Light Rail Transit. 
Since Harry became the president of the 
Minnesota Building and Construction Trades 
Council in 2009, he has tirelessly promoted 
growth and advancement of affiliated unions, 
supported diversity and inclusion efforts in the 
construction industry, protected health and 
safety for all workers, and encouraged rela-
tionship building with employers, other labor 
organizations, and government officials. He 
has been a leader in the transformation to-
ward clean energy jobs, and has navigated 
the council through the many challenges 
brought on in the past year by the COVID–19 
pandemic and the civil unrest that enveloped 
the Twin Cities after the death of George 
Floyd. 
Throughout it all, Harry has been an unwav-
ering voice for Minnesota’s working families, 
and a dedicated public servant. It has been 
my great pleasure to work closely with Harry 
on many projects and priorities over the years, 
and I know I speak for many in the community 
of Saint Paul and the East Metro when l say 
that he has been a tremendous asset to the 
labor movement. Madam Speaker, please join 
me in honoring the outstanding career of one 
of our state’s most effective leaders, Harry 
Melander.

June 14, 2021 
In her time serving as my chief of staff, 
Mela has been an invaluable partner. No mat-
ter the situation, my office has been able to 
rely on her strong leadership and fierce advo-
cacy for getting the job done. She has been 
a consummate professional, ably navigating 
the various issues we’ve faced with grace and 
dignity. 
It’s no exaggeration to say that our success 
over the past three years can be directly at-
tributed to Mela’s knack for finding talent. In 
fact, every single member that currently works 
on Team Slotkin in our D.C. office was inter-
viewed and hired by Mela. 
Now, as Mela gets ready to embark on her 
next chapter as Secretary Lloyd Austin’s dep-
uty chief of staff, I wanted to take a moment 
to recognize her on the floor of the People’s 
House with tributes from the team that she 
has led for the past three years. 
When asked to sum up the essence of 
Mela, most of my staff pointed to her strong 
work ethic and her ability to stay calm, cool 
and collected under pressure. They talked 
about her leading by example and seeing no 
job too large or too small. They also mention 
her deep compassion toward the people we 
serve and her thoughtful and skillful commu-
nication. 
Those who were with us at the very begin-
ning remember the chaos of setting up our 
freshman congressional office. They recall a 
moment of endless opportunities and seem-
ingly endless challenges, requiring patience, 
discipline, and immense attention to detail. 
As my staff will tell you, Mela dove into the 
role of chief—adding additional team mem-
bers, implementing processes, and getting our 
office up and running in order to serve the 
folks who call Michigan’s 8th district home. 
When staff needed decisive action without a 
moment’s hesitation, they attest that Mela was 
always there to execute. When staff in the dis-
trict office and the D.C. office needed to circle 
up and hash out a way forward, Mela was in-
strumental in facilitating the conversation. And 
when our partners back home needed a reli-
able partner in dealing with the office, they 
praised Mela for building relationships that still 
bear fruit to this day. 
For the younger members of my staff, par-
ticularly the younger women, they’ve learned 
from Mela by seeing her operate up close. On 
too many occasions to count, they saw her 
think, both on her feet and outside the box, in 
order to make the impossible seem possible. 
They mention her mentorship and professional 
development as instrumental in giving them 
the confidence to assert themselves in the 
workplace. 
My staff also appreciated Mela’s unique 
ability to jump in—at any level—to help the 
team. In three years, she guided our team 
through an impeachment inquiry, public town 
halls to explain the decision, a war powers 
resolution drafted in the wee hours of the 
night, an insurrection and a second impeach-
ment. Every member of the staff remembers 
how Mela was in the trenches with them dur-
ing every one of these key events. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic turned con-
gressional offices upside down last March, our 
office was able to nimbly adapt, thanks to 
Mela. One of our congressional fellows at the 
time appreciated how she spearheaded the 
transition from in-person work to telework in 
the span of a week, making sure that folks 
had the tools to do their jobs in order to avoid 
any drop-off in service to our constituents. 
Lastly, my team has appreciated the culture 
of respect and cooperation that is instilled in 
every new addition to the team. More than 
one staffer talked about her metaphor of our 
office being in a boat—with each member row-
ing as hard as they can in the same direction. 
With Mela at the helm, we’ve been able to ac-
complish this in spades. 
No tribute to Mela would be complete with-
out mentioning her husband, Kurt. In the mili-
tary, there is a tradition of honoring a retiring 
member’s service as well as their family’s sac-
rifice. To Kurt, who well understands this sen-
timent as an active duty service member in 
the U.S. Navy himself, I want to extend my 
deepest gratitude for his willingness to support 
Mela when we had an early morning prep ses-
sion or a late night mark-up. 
Madam Speaker, to say that Mela Louise 
Norman will be missed is an enormous under-
statement. Her record speaks for itself. 
In the days and weeks ahead, I have no 
doubt that our team will be putting out the lat-
est fire or handling the next crisis with the 
question: ‘‘What would Mela do?’’ 
In the meantime, we wish her all the best as 
she returns to her old stomping grounds at the 
Pentagon. On behalf of a grateful district and 
a grateful team, I thank Mela.

HONORING TRINITY HOUSE OF 
PRAYER CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
church, Trinity House of Prayer Church. 
The Trinity House of Prayer Church is in-
spired by God and initiated by the Man of 
God, to win souls for the Kingdom, to bring 
salvation, healing, and deliverance, to God’s 
people, also, to carry the gospel to the lost 
sheep, and to create unity among God’s peo-
ple of all denominations. 
In February of 1974, Bishop and First Lady 
Knighten, along with their children, moved 
back to Mississippi under the inspiration of 
God. Bishop organized the Christian Fellow-
ship Mission so that different denominations 
could come together in fellowship. Many fol-
lowers had no church home. They asked 
Bishop Knighten to organize a church so they 
could join. In 1977, he organized the Trinity 
House of Prayer Church, in a building that he 
rented to set up a business. The first service 
was held on Sunday, December 10, 1977, 
with Bishop Knighten delivering the opening 
sermon. 
As the ministry was growing, several 
churches derived from Trinity Ministries. So, 
Trinity House of Prayer of Moorhead became 
the Mother Church. Still the membership grew 
at the Mother Church to where a bigger 
church was needed. A stretch of land on the 
west end of town was prayed over and 
claimed by some of the church members. God 
answered their prayers and the land became 
property of the Trinity House of Prayer Min-
istries. After hiring someone to lay the founda-
tion and frame up the building, the saints 
rolled up their sleeves and went to work. Their 
faithfulness 
was 
beyond 
measure. 
They 
worked many long hours and far over in the 
night, to complete their new church home. 
Today, they sit in what resulted from the faith-
fulness and hard work of the saints, the moth-
er church of the Trinity House of Prayer Min-
istries. 
God has blessed the Trinity Ministry for 
years. Many people from all walks of life have 
been inspired, saved and loved by this min-
istry that God has entrusted to Bishop 
Knighten. Even though many people have 
passed through the ministry and some church-
es have left, God is still is blessing the Trinity 
House of Prayer Ministry. The purpose of the 
Trinity Ministry is to allow God to manifest the 
vision which he has placed on this part of His 
body. The harvest is white, and the labors are 
few. Now is the time to do what God has com-
missioned Bishop Knighten to ‘‘gather God’s 
people together unto Him; those that have 
made a covenant with God by sacrifice.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Trinity House of Prayer 
Church for its longevity and dedication to serv-
ing others.

CITY OF WHEAT RIDGE, CO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, to recognize the City of Wheat Ridge, 
Colorado for being recognized as an All-Amer-
ican City for 2021, awarded by the National 
Civic League. 
The theme for 2021, ‘‘Building Equitable and 
Resilient Communities’’, focused on recog-
nizing communities that have worked to im-
prove broad-based economic prosperity while 
also adapting and evolving during a chal-
lenging time. 
Incorporated in 1969, Wheat Ridge has 
evolved from a quiet city to a bustling suburb 
while finding ways to honor its roots and its 
unique character and improving quality of life 
for its residents. The city was awarded based 
on three programs that highlighted the city’s 
work to increase equity and resiliency. 
The ‘‘Wheaties Academy’’, a leadership pro-
gram developed to expand and diversify the 
civic voice within the community, has success-
fully engaged a wide array of community 
members and reflected the actual diversity of 
the city. Secondly, the creation of ‘‘Sustainable 
Wheat Ridge’’, an environmental stewardship 
program, worked to prioritize a vision for the 
city as outlined in the city’s long-term strategic 
plan. Comprised of 11 resident volunteers, the 
committee dedicated over 550 hours to com-
plete the action plan which was approved and 
funded by the city. Lastly, the ‘‘Wheat Ridge 
Together’’ initiative is a collaborative effort to 
respond to the dual challenges of the COVID– 
19 pandemic and racial justice issues within 
the community. Wheat Ridge was well-posi-
tioned to face the challenges of the pandemic 
due to two new virtual public engagement 
tools that were launched prior to the pan-
demic: What’s Up Wheat Ridge and Wheat 
Ridge Speaks, both of which provided on line 
opportunities for the community to engage 
with the city and provide public comment on 
city business. Wheat Ridge Speaks hosted 54 
virtual meetings in 2020 and 166 comments 
were submitted electronically.

CELEBRATING WILLIAM AND IDA 
MAE ALLEN’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to extend my sincere congratulations to 
William and Ida Mae Allen of Jefferson Coun-
ty, Arkansas, for their 50th wedding anniver-
sary. 
Having grown up in Moscow, Arkansas, Wil-
liam and Ida Mae Allen married on June 13, 
1971. As adults, they made their home in Jef-
ferson County, raising three sons and two 
daughters. They later adopted six boys into 
their family, teaching them all to fear a right-
eous God and seek always to be like Him. 
The Allens believe that their successful mar-
riage can be best attributed to their reliance 
on Christ, the Church, and good leadership. 
As they told their children and grandchildren, 
one must always live their life to please Christ. 
Giving advice to younger married couples, the 
Allens said that troubles will come, but one 
should always stay and fight them out to-
gether. 
I take this time today to congratulate William 
and Ida Mae on fifty years of marriage and to 
thank them for being an example to genera-
tions of young Arkansans. The Allens epito-
mize what can be accomplished through per-
severance, commitment, family, and faith. I 
thank them for their dedication to the most sa-
cred of American values.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 20TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE INCORPORA-
TION OF SMITHS STATION 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 20th anniversary 
of the incorporation of Smiths Station. 
Smiths Station was first settled in 1738. The 
Central of Georgia Railway extended a train 
line through the community, using it to connect 
Opelika, Alabama and Columbus, Georgia. 
Shortly after this, the name of Smiths was 
decided on to honor the memory of Broadus 
Smith, a prominent settler who once lived in 
the community. The area is now known as 
Smiths Station. 
Smiths Station existed as a ‘‘bedroom com-
munity’’ and a convenient halfway spot be-
tween the Auburn-Opelika and Columbus- 
Phenix City metropolitan areas. 
After years of advocacy and hard work, a 
group of Smiths Station residents helped push 
for a successful vote to incorporate Smiths 
Station on June 22, 2001. Later that year, 
LaFaye Dellinger was elected as the City’s 
first Mayor, serving in the position from 2001 
until 2016. Current Mayor F.L. ‘‘Bubba’’ 
Copeland was elected in 2016 and ran unop-
posed in the 2020 municipal election. The cur-
rent City Council consists of Place 1 Council 
Member George Stringer, Place 2 Council 
Member Morris Jackson, Council Place 3 
Member Steve Lansdon, Place 4 Council 
Member Richard Cooley and Place 5 Council 
Member Victoria Green. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the 20th anniversary of the incorpora-
tion of Smiths Station.

HONORING JASMINE TAYLOR 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Cadet Jasmine Taylor. 
Promoted to Cadet Colonel Taylor will serve 
as the JPS JROTC Brigade Commander for 
the School Year 2021–2022. A junior at 
Callaway High School, Taylor currently serves 
as the 4th Battalion Executive Officer. 
Cadet Colonel Taylor is truly an extraor-
dinary person, outstanding scholar, and lead-
er. She is highly dedicated, very goal oriented, 
and will work diligently for what she is pas-
sionate about. One of her short-term goals is 
to become the valedictorian of her class by 
maintaining and increasing her 4.0 GPA. 
Cadet Colonel Taylor has been very active 
within JROTC for three strong consecutive 
years, and before that, she was in the Junior 
Cadet Corps at Powell Middle School Acad-
emy of Military Science. 
At Callaway High School, she participates in 
the National Junior Honor Society, the JROTC 
Drill Team, the Charger ‘‘Funk’’ Band, Finally 
First Mentorship, and TAP. She has performed 
various acts of community service, such as 
feeding the homeless at Stewpot, visiting the 
elderly at nursing homes, and caring for res-
cued animals. She also participated in the 
Jackson State University Interdisciplinary Cen-
ter of Nanotoxicity STEM Leadership Academy 
Summer Institute. 
After high school, Cadet Colonel Taylor 
plans to attend college to obtain a degree and 
become an animal scientist. She credits her 
family, instructors and community for con-
stantly pushing her to become the better 
version of herself. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Cadet Colonel Jasmine 
Taylor for her passion and dedication for suc-
cess and desire to make a difference in the 
community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LLOYD 
PRICE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in remembering the life of Lloyd Price, a 
longtime District of Columbia resident and 
great R&B vocalist and performer, who died 
on May 3, 2021. 
Lloyd Price, born in Kenner, Louisiana, on 
March 9, 1933, came to the District after serv-
ing in the U.S. Army. Growing up, he received 
formal training in the trumpet and piano and 
sang in his church’s gospel choir. Upon return-
ing from his military service, he formed KRC 
Records with songwriter Harold Logan. 
He had number one hits, such as Lawdy 
Miss Clawdy, Stagger Lee, Personality, I’m 
Going to Get Married and Where Were You 
on Our Wedding Day. In 1998, Price was in-
ducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 
and in 2019, he was inducted into the National 
Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. 
He was also a great businessman. He pro-
duced some of the greatest fights in the his-
tory of boxing, such as The Thriller in Manila 
and The Rumble in the Jungle. 
Other business ventures included founding 
a construction company, which erected mid-
dle-income housing in the Bronx and Staten 
Island. He also managed Lloyd Price Icon 
Food Brands, which makes a line of Southern- 
style foods. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring Lloyd 
Price, a great singer and longtime resident of 
D.C. I extend my deepest condolences to 
Lloyd’s family.

RECOGNIZING AND HONORING 
JESSICA MIER 
HON. SARA JACOBS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and honor my staff 
member, Jessica Mier, who left my office on 
June 4, 2021. 
Jessica Mier has served as my Deputy 
Chief of Staff in San Diego for the better part 
of 2021, helping me set up my office and lead-
ing my district staff during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
After graduating from California State Uni-
versity, Sacramento in 2006, Jessica began 
her long career in public service—first in high-
er education, then through an internship in a 
Member of Congress’s legislative office. 
Her summer internship made an extraor-
dinary impact on her, and led her to pursue 
her next phase of service as a staff member 
for elected officials. Over the last 15 years, 
Jessica has worked for a U.S. Senator, four 
House Members, and a City Mayor in many 
different capacities. For the past four years, 
Jessica has led the district office of the 53rd 
Congressional District. 
We have been so fortunate to rely on 
Jessica’s breadth of knowledge and connec-
tion to the communities she loves and has 
represented for so long. Her focus has always 
been on the constituents she serves and mak-
ing sure their needs are met or exceeded. 
Though she has managed to do so much for 
her communities over the years, her humility 
will never let her take credit. 
Jessica’s biggest accomplishment comes 
not in the form of professional achievements 
or awards—though she has many—but in the 
indelible impact that she has had on anyone 
lucky enough to work with her and under her 
supervision. While Jessica may be leaving our 
office, her work will live on through the public

CELEBRATING 
PROFESSOR 
ED-
MUND W. GORDON’S 100TH BIRTH-
DAY 
HON. STEVEN HORSFORD 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Professor 
Edmund W. Gordon, who was born on June 
13, 1921. Professor Gordon is an extraor-
dinary professor of psychology whose career 
work has heavily influenced contemporary 
thinking in psychology, education, and social 
policy. Professor Gordon’s research and initia-
tives have focused on the positive develop-
ment of under-served children of color, includ-
ing advancing the concept of the ‘‘achieve-
ment gap.’’ 
Professor Gordon grew up in a highly seg-
regated area of North Carolina to parents who 
encouraged the importance of schooling. He 
received both his Bachelor’s and Master’s de-
grees from Howard University, and went on to 
pursue a PhD in psychology at the Teacher’s 
College at Columbia University. 
In 1956, after working with mentor and 
friend W.E.B. DuBois, Professor Gordon was 
commissioned by President Lyndon B. John-
son to help design the Head Start Program, 
aimed at providing early childhood education 
and family services to under-resourced fami-
lies. After six months working on Head Start, 
Professor Gordon and his team had built a 
program to serve nearly half a million children. 
Professor Gordon also conducted research 
that would later be used to prove to the Su-
preme Court that school segregation had 
harmful effects on children. Professor Gordon 
strongly advocated the importance of under-
standing the learner’s frame of reference in 
the development of education action plans. 
Professor Gordon is the John M. Musser 
Professor of Psychology, Emeritus at Yale 
University, Richard March Hoe Professor, 
Emeritus of Psychology and Education and 
Founding Director of The Edmund W. Gordon 
Institute of Urban and Minority Education 
(IUME) at Teachers College, Columbia Univer-
sity. 
From July 2000 until August 2001, Pro-
fessor Gordon was Vice President of Aca-
demic Affairs and Interim Dean at Teachers 
College, Columbia University. Professor Gor-
don has held appointments at several of the 
nation’s leading universities including Howard, 
Yeshiva, Columbia, City University of New 
York, Yale, and the Educational Testing Serv-
ice. He has served as visiting professor at City 
College of New York and Harvard. 
Currently, Professor Gordon is the Senior 
Scholar and Advisor to the President of the 
College Board where he developed and co- 
chaired the Taskforce on Minority High 
Achievement. 
As a clinician and researcher, Professor 
Gordon explored divergent learning styles and 
advocated for supplemental education long 
before most scholars had recognized the ex-
istence and importance of those ideas. From 
2011 to 2013, Professor Gordon organized 
and mentored the Gordon Commission, bring-
ing together scholars to research and report 
on the Future of Assessment for Education. 
Professor Gordon has authored 18 books 
and more than 200 articles on the achieve-
ment gap, affirmative development of aca-
demic ability, and supplementary education. 
He has been elected a Fellow of many pres-
tigious organizations, including the American 
Academy of Arts & Science, and has been 
named one of America’s most prolific and 
thoughtful scholars. 
Today, Professor Gordon still pays close at-
tention to the state of education, and has stat-
ed that he would love to be able to change 
national education policy ‘‘to get a more equal 
focus on out-of-school and in-school learning.’’ 
On April 12, 2021, Professor Gordon was 
appointed as the first ever Honorary President 
of the American Educational Research Asso-
ciation. 
I wish Professor Edmund W. Gordon the 
very best as he and his family celebrate his 
100th birthday.

HONORING TURNER CHAPEL AME 
CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
church, Turner Chapel African Methodist Epis-
copal Church. 
In 1890, Rev. C.E. Jones, four men and two 
women decided that there should be an 
A.M.E. Church in Greenwood, Mississippi. Led 
by the Spirit of God, they began to worship 
under a brush harbor somewhere in the vicin-
ity of what is now the Greenwood Post Office. 
During the next few years, the church began 
to increase in membership, and they decided 
that a building was needed. One of the mem-
bers came up with the idea of utilizing a dwell-
ing house which was eventually purchased. 
Rev. Jones and the members decided to 
name the church Turner Chapel for Bishop 
Henry McNeil Turner, Presiding Prelate, who 
was elected and consecrated the fifteenth 
Bishop of the Connectional A.M.E. Church. 
There were many leaders of the church but 
possibly one of the most memorable was Rev. 
D.L. Tucker. Under Rev. D.L. Tucker’s admin-
istration, a new spirit seemed to have risen. 
Pews were purchased, and the pulpit was re-
designed with divided chancellor rails. Many 
new members were added to Turner Chapel 
Church’s roll. Rev. Tucker served as pastor 
during the height of the civil rights era. During 
his time as pastor, he became the first presi-
dent of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the 
Mississippi Delta. He organized voter registra-
tion drives and often had rallies at Turner 
Chapel. 
Rev. Tucker was the first person in Leflore 
County, MS to pass the literacy test to vote. 
After that accomplishment, while he was 
marching with supporters, dogs were put on 
them by law enforcement to deter their desire 
to vote. Rev. Tucker walks with a limp today 
because of that attack. This incident spurred 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to write Presi-
dent John Kennedy to send protection to Mis-
sissippi for Blacks. As a comrade of Medgar 
Evers, Rev. Tucker spoke with him before he 
was assassinated in Jackson, MS by Byron 
Dela Beckwith in 1963. Just as he was getting 
things together for the church and the citizens 
of Greenwood, he received a call in the middle 
of the night in which the voice on the other 
end said, ‘‘We just killed that N----Medgar 
Evers; you will be next.’’ His life was subse-
quently threatened; due to death threats from 
the Ku Klux Klan, the A.M.E. Church moved 
him to a church in Bermuda. Rev. Tucker re-
turned to Mississippi in 2014 and is recog-
nized in the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum 
for his contributions to the movement. Many of 
the future leaders of the church continued in 
Rev. Tucker’s footsteps by being advocates 
for civil rights. 
Turner Chapel is blessed to have Rev. Dr. 
Alice H. Crenshaw as their pastor. The visions 
she brought to the church are exceptional. 
Rev. Crenshaw brought back life to the church 
because now they have bible study once 
again and prayer meetings. She has gotten 
more members involved, especially men with 
the business of the church. Three months 
after Rev. Crenshaw’s arrival, the pandemic 
happened, and everything shut down. How-
ever, even the pandemic did not stop her from 
pastoring. She instilled in the members to con-
tinue having their regular programs, official 
board meetings, bible study, even in the pan-
demic, over Zoom meetings. In April of 2020, 
she was able to get food distribution into the 
Greenwood community in which the church 
has drive-by pick-up of food boxes for those in 
need. In December 2020, she was able to get 
a contract with a vendor. Now Turner Chapel 
is one of the largest sites of food box distribu-
tion to area churches, the Greenwood commu-
nity, throughout Leflore County and beyond. 
Rev. Crenshaw’s vision includes helping the 
church get an adult daycare center, as well as 
acquiring the property adjacent to the church 
for an Elderly Independent group home. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Turner Chapel African 
Methodist Episcopal Church for its longevity 
and dedication to serving the community.

The U.S. Army was founded on June 14,

lutionary War. The Army is the eldest branch 
of the U.S. military and answers at a mo-
ment’s notice when the country needs it 
most—from the Revolutionary War, World War 
II, the Vietnam War, and most recently the 
battle 
against 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Today, we honor the legacy of the brave men

and women who served and are currently 
serving to protect our country and preserve 
our way of life. 
Answering the call to duty is not an easy 
one, but it is one that is worth it. 90,000 sol-
diers and their family members call the El 
Paso Area home through Fort Bliss presence 
in our community. Fort Bliss is vital to the 
Army’s readiness because it trains and mobi-
lizes soldiers to perform global operations in 
support of our national military strategy. I, and 
the rest of the El Paso community, are appre-
ciative of the Army and Fort Bliss’ service to 
our country and are grateful for each soldier 
and their family’s sacrifices, service, and lead-
ership. 
On this day, I recognize the Army’s 246th

CONGRATULATING THE 70TH WED-
DING ANNIVERSARY OF MR. AND 
MRS. FRED IVERS 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 70th wedding anniver-
sary of Lewisville, Arkansas, natives, Fred and 
Christine Ivers. Mr. and Mrs. Ivers exhibit 
strong values of family, commitment, and sac-
rifice which set them apart as an example in 
their community. 
After meeting at ages 21 and 17, the couple 
dated for a little over a year before getting 
married on May 26, 1951. As newlyweds, they 
faced many obstacles together, but they soon 
became the proud parents of four children— 
three boys and one girl. Mr. and Mrs. Ivers 
raised their children in church and always 
lived by their motto: ‘‘those who pray together, 
stay together.’’ 
The couple believes the secret to their 70 
years of marriage is keeping God first. Family 
is very important to the Ivers, and their chil-
dren attest to this. In the words of their oldest 
son, ‘‘They set such a tremendous example 
for myself and my siblings and lived their lives 
to the fullest’’. 
I take this time today to celebrate Mr. and 
Mrs. Ivers for the example they have set for 
generations of Fourth District Arkansans and

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF OTIS MAXWELL 
JAMES, JR. AND SUE ANN WIL-
KINS JAMES 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 50th wedding an-
niversary of Otis Maxwell James, Jr. and Sue 
Ann Wilkins James who were married on June 
6, 1971. 
I recognize this 50th Anniversary on behalf 
of Manu and Cassidy Sharma. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the James and wishing them a happy 
50th wedding anniversary. 
HONORING TRIPLE C SCREEN 
PRINTING 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a prosperous 
family business, Triple C Screen Printing. 
From humble beginnings, Triple C began in 
1985 as a t-shirt printing store in Shaw, MS. 
The name coming from the founder, Clifton 
William’s three children, Clifton Jr., Clinton and 
Celena. Clinton Williams is currently the 
Owner/President and CEO of the store. 
Clifton Williams, Sr. was originally a school-
teacher for 25 years and recently passed 
away in January 2021. He also had a barber-
shop in the same building where Triple C was 
orginally located. As the business started to 
grow, he thought it would make sense to 
move to Cleveland, MS. When Clinton grad-
uated from Mississippi Valley State University 
and took an active role in the business, he re-
alized that customers needed to have more 
control and choice instead of just presenting 
them with available designs. Today, the cus-
tomer will tell him what they’re looking for, and 
he designs it, produce a model and does the 
printing. 
The majority of Triple C Screen Printing cli-
ents are individuals and small businesses 
throughout the Mississippi Delta. Triple C loyal 
patrons includes West Bolivar, who has been 
a client since 1989, churches, other busi-
nesses and individuals. One of Triple C’s best 
and biggest customers every two years is my-
self. It has been through this connection that, 
last year Triple C was able to add a major 
new and national client. They would not be 
here today or have lasted this long without 
their clients. 
Thankfully, Triple C is back to being steady 
again amid COVID–19. 
Clint’s daughter, Justice, also works at their 
printing store with him. She came to work for 
him after she graduated from Mississippi State 
University where she majored in Graphic De-
sign, just as he did and minored in sales and 
marketing. She plans to keep the family busi-
ness tradition alive—she plans to run the busi-
ness one day. His wife, Shonda, is a nurse 
practitioner at Delta Health Center in Mound 
Bayou. They celebrated their 20th wedding 
anniversary this year. 
Clinton is proud and honored to canyon his 
dad’s legacy with his daughter by his side. 
This story began when one day Mr. Clifton 
Williams decided to design a t-shirt for a Jack-
son State University versus MS Valley State. 
He taught himself how to do printing with no 
internet, no YouTube tutorials, no classes— 
just set his mind to it and consequently, start-
ed a new business venture and career. That’s 
how Triple C Screen Printing came to be 
through his dad’s hard work and dreams. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Triple C Screen Printing for 
their dedication to serving the community, 
state and Nation. 
HONORING DR. LUIS CARLOS MOLL 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 14, 2021 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Luis Carlos Moll, Pro-
fessor Emeritus at the University of Arizona, 
for his election to the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences (The Academy.) The Acad-
emy was created in 1780 and serves to honor 
leaders in various fields. Previously elected 
members include Benjamin Franklin, Alex-
ander Hamilton, Martin Luther King, Charles 
Darwin, and Dr. Fauci. This year, new mem-
bers include Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Maria Hino-
josa, and Oprah Winfrey. The Academy also 
includes an ‘‘Education’’ section, to which Dr. 
Moll has been elected in 2021. 
Born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, Dr. Moll re-
members his early experiences with school as 
extremely difficult. At the age of 15 he moved 
to Los Angeles with his mother and grand-
mother. Later in life he would often begin one 
of his prodigious talks by recollecting this 
move from his native Puerto Rico and would 
famously say, ‘‘As soon as I stepped onto 
U.S. soil, I became a minority.’’ His profound 
ability to recognize social inequity are em-
blematic of his enduring concern for deeply 
understanding the circumstances that shape 
lives and how these can impact educational 
futures. He joined the U.S. Army in 1966 and 
served for three years, including six months in 
Vietnam. After his military service he returned 
to study at Cal Poly, graduating with a B.S. in 
1972. He went on to earn a master’s degree 
in psychiatric social work from the University 
of Southern California. During his studies at 
USC he worked with Latino families at an East 
Los Angeles mental health clinic. He enjoyed 
the work, and later applied to the doctoral pro-
gram in educational psychology at UCLA. 
Prior to his earning his PhD, Dr. Moll com-
pleted a PreDoctoral Fellowship at the Institute 
for Comparative Human Development at 
Rockefeller University in New York. In 1986, 
Dr. Moll joined the faculty of Language, Read-
ing and Culture at the University of Arizona 
(VA). 
Dr. Moll has dedicated his career to the 
study of language acquisition and bilingual 
education, primarily in Latino students in the 
United States. His scholarship attests the 
value of transdisciplinarity, as his main re-
search interest is the connection among cul-
ture, psychology, and education, especially as 
it relates to the education of Latino children in 
the U.S. Among other studies, he has ana-
lyzed the quality of classroom teaching, exam-
ined literacy instruction in English and Span-
ish, studied how knowledge is produced in the 
broader social contexts of household and 
community life, and, in collaboration with 
teachers, attempted to establish pedagogical 
relationships among these domains of study. 
He has focused much of his work on the appli-
cation of Vygotskyan theory to understand the 
processes of language acquisition and learn-
ing in general for Latino children in the U.S. 
Furthermore, Dr. Moll is highly recognized for 
the development of the ‘‘Funds of Knowledge’’ 
theory, in collaboration with colleagues at the 
University of Arizona. His extensive work has 
a central theme: educators must uncover and

utilize the social, cultural, and linguistic proc-
esses of diverse communities as the most im-
portant resources for producing positive edu-
cational change. This powerful message has 
helped educators in Tucson and around the 
world ‘‘see’’ Latino families with respect and 
with appreciation for the wealth of resources 
they have accumulated as a result of living 
their lives. Dr. Moll has changed not only en-
tire disciplinary fields, he has also changed 
lives. In collaboration with his colleagues, Dr. 
Moll excavated the rich relationships, knowl-
edges, and histories of the local Tucson com-
munity. Their collected work on the Funds of 
Knowledge available to families in Latinx com-
munities is one of the most impressive re-
search efforts in the anthropology of education 
ever. They are a constant source of findings 
and insights that address questions not just 
about what is missing from poor and immi-
grant children in school, but also what re-
sources they have and what resources they 
bring to the classroom. The concept of Funds 
of Knowledge continues to be one of the most 
significant theoretical developments in the 
fields of anthropology, education, and psy-
chology. As a result of a lifetime of out-
standing mentorship, his work continues to be 
utilized and expanded by new generations of 
educators and researchers throughout the 
globe. Dr. Moll’s scholarship has evolved and 
traveled across sectors—early childhood, K– 
12, and postsecondary contexts—and many 
regions of the world, including Spain, the U.K., 
New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, South 
America, and Mexico, as well as all over the 
United States. 
Dr. Moll’s publications are often used in re-
search focusing on education, language acqui-
sition, literacy, the production and value of 
knowledge, and transnationalism to name a 
few. Most importantly, Dr. Moll’s academic en-
deavors have always been centered on social 
and educational justice for minority families, 
children, and youth and as such it has been 
used to generate policy and educational strat-
egies that prioritize the well-being and best 
practices for said populations. Simply put, his 
legacy to the fields of education, psychology 
and language studies in general is remark-
able. He has served on the editorial board of 
several journals, including the American Edu-
cational Research Journal, Educational Re-
searcher, Reading Research Quarterly, Jour-
nal of Literacy Research, and Mind, Culture, 
and Activity. Among his honors, he was elect-
ed to membership in the National Academy of 
Education (1998), named a Kappa Delta Pi 
Laureate (2013), and to the Reading Hall of 
Fame (2014). He was also named Fellow 
(2009), received the Presidential Citation 
Award (2010) and the Palmer O. Johnson 
Award (2011), all from the American Edu-
cational Research Association (AERA). He 
also presented the 2009 AERA Brown Lec-
ture. 
He became an academic counselor, friend, 
and family to most people he interacted with. 
Thanks to Dr. Moll many of his students, 
around the world, are continuing his legacy as 
educators, professors, and researchers. 
Dr. Moll currently lives in Tucson, Arizona 
with his wife Ana. He has two children, Carlos 
and Eric.
