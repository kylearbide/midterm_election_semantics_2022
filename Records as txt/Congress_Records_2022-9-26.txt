HONORING JACLYN WULFEKUHLE 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 26, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Jaclyn Wulfekuhle a tireless advo-
cate for women, and the Director of Women 
United as Iowan of the Week. March is Wom-
en’s History Month, so it is important to high-
light the great work women are doing across 
the country to make the United States a better 
place to Live. 
Women United is a diverse, vibrant group 
bound together by the mission to improve the 
future of our youngest Central Iowans. They 
use their voices to represent the children in 
our community. Their mission is to roll up their 
sleeves to give the community’s youngest 
learners the best start and leave a legacy of 
change that makes central Iowa better for ev-
eryone. Jaclyn has been with United Way for 
8 years, most recently as director of Women 
United and previously as the director of Lead-
ership and giving at LINC, a young profes-
sionals’ donor group of United Way that she 
created, which has grown to 200 members in 
its first two years. She also has helped lead 
the annual United Way campaign, managing 
large company relationships. 
Women United—formerly known as Wom-
en’s Leadership Connection—is an organiza-
tion for any woman who believes that all chil-
dren deserve quality early care and learning 
opportunities from birth. Each year, they invest 
more than $1.6 million in research-based strat-
egies and programs that create a lasting im-
pact on the next generation. Since 2002, 
Women United has raised more than $21 mil-
lion to improve the network of care and learn-
ing that ensures young children are ready to 
succeed in school. More than 700 of central 
Iowa’s most generous and influential women 
give their time, voice, and resources to sup-
port quality early learning and provide opportu-
nities for those who need it most. 
Women are the backbone of so many com-
munities throughout our country. It is critical to 
not only recognize them but to also support 
women even outside the parameters of wom-
en’s history month. It is my honor to recognize 
Jaclyn Wulfekuhle as Iowan of the week. I will 
always fight in congress to support women as 
well promote and push for legislation that pro-
tects women’s rights.

COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE NEW HAMP-
SHIRE STATE VETERANS CEME-
TERY 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 26, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the New Hampshire State Vet-
erans Cemetery on its 25th Anniversary. This 
incredible milestone is a testament to the im-
pact of the cemetery on the state, and the vital 
role that it plays in the lives of veterans, their 
families, and our community. 
The New Hampshire State Veterans Ceme-
tery is a source of pride to veterans, their fam-
ilies, and New Hampshire. It expresses the 
state’s gratitude for veterans’ service to the 
country by providing and maintaining a dig-
nified final-resting place to honor all veterans 
and eligible dependents. It gives families the 
comfort to connect with their lost loved ones 
and conveys the importance and the value of 
the veterans’ service to our community. Hon-
oring our veterans is not a duty reserved for 
Memorial Day, Veterans Day, or the 4th of 
July—it’s an ongoing appreciation. This site al-
lows us to honor, remember, and pay our re-
spects. 
As Granite Staters seek comfort and guid-
ance, and learn how to best help their neigh-
bors, the New Hampshire State Veterans 
Cemetery remains an important resource here 
in New Hampshire. The cemetery’s Memorial 
Brick Walkway, 20 Points of History, and Vet-
erans Heritage Learning Center provides in-
sights into the role our local heroes played in 
New Hampshire, American, and global history. 
The grounds are a living memorial educating 
and allowing New Hampshire residents to 
make personal connections to those who have 
served. 
I would like to thank The New Hampshire 
Veterans Cemetery Association for its dedica-
tion to our heroes and congratulate them on 
25 years as a symbol of our appreciation for 
our veterans’ service. On behalf of my con-
stituents in New Hampshire’s First Congres-
sional District, I congratulate the New Hamp-
shire State Veterans Cemetery for its out-
standing contributions to the state and wish 
them continued success.

HONORING PRESIDENT MARCELO 
REBELO DE SOUSA 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 26, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today, 
along with my colleague, Congressman DAVID 
VALADAO, to honor President Marcelo Rebelo 
de Sousa of Portugal. 
President Rebelo de Sousa has been a 
champion for the Portuguese people, and a 
symbolic figure for the thriving Portuguese 
community here in the Valley. Most recently, 
he’s fought with conviction to mitigate the ef-
fects of COVID–19 in Portugal, and ensure a 
fair and effective economic recovery. 
President Rebelo de Sousa was elected to 
his second term in January 2021, earning 
60.70 percent of the vote and finished nearly 
48 percentage points above his runner up. 
President Rebelo de Sousa led the Social 
Democratic Party from 1996 to 1999. After the 
Social Democratic Party joined the European 
People’s Party (EPP), he served as Vice- 
President of the EPP. He was a deputy to the 
Constitutional Assembly in 1976, and served 
in the 8th Constitutional Government as Sec-
retary of State of the Presidency of the Coun-
cil of Ministers. He then served as Minister of 
Parliamentary Affairs. 
During his long and esteemed career, Presi-
dent Rebelo de Sousa has worked in jour-
nalism, as a political commentator, and in the 
social sector. For generations of Portuguese, 
Rebelo de Sousa was a trusted analyst behind 
much of the news. Before turning 30 he was 
appointed as assistant director of ‘Expresso,’ 
and in 1983 he founded the news organization 
Semana´rio. He also worked on TV stations 
RTP and TVI. 
His political career has also included service 
in local government as Municipal Deputy, Met-
ropolitan Deputy, Councilor and President of 
the Municipal Assemblies of Cascais, Lisbon, 
and Celorico de Basto. 
He earned his Doctorate in Legal and Polit-
ical Science and has taught widely, including 
as a tenured professor at the Faculty of Law 
at Lisbon University. 
On behalf of our Portuguese community in 
the central valley, we welcome President 
Rebelo de Sousa to Gustine and Livingston. 
Portuguese have been making their home in 
California since the early 16th century. Since 
then, they’ve become leaders in politics, edu-
cation, the military, and agriculture, notably the 
dairy industry. We’re honored by President 
Rebelo de Sousa’s first visit to the Central 
Valley and he is always welcome here. 
Madam Speaker, we ask our colleagues to 
join us in celebrating and honoring President 
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN SMITH 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 26, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
recognize John Smith, a member of the Gar-
den City Fire Department, on the occasion of 
his promotion to Fire Marshal. 
Fire Marshal Smith attended Schoolcraft 
College where he obtained his paramedic 
training while also attending the fire academy. 
He began his career in public safety in 2005, 
working for Huron Valley Ambulance. During 
his twelve years of service at Huron Valley, he 
steadily rose through the ranks, ultimately 
serving as Senior Paramedic in the Ann Arbor 
and Chelsea area. In addition, Fire Marshal 
Smith provided valuable support to law en-
forcement while he served as a member of the 
Tactical Emergency Medical Services (TEMS) 
team as a Tactical Casualty Care (TAC) medic 
for the Michigan State Police Emergency Sup-
port Team, Washtenaw Metro SWAT team, 
and other local law enforcement agencies. 
During his service, Smith provided them crit-
ical medical support during high-risk search

warrants and other law enforcement oper-
ations. In addition to his official duties in public 
service, Smith was also a member of the bike 
team and worked many special events includ-
ing medical support for University of Michigan 
sporting events. 
In 2017, Fire Marshal Smith left Huron Val-
ley Ambulance to pursue his dream of working 
in the fire service. After briefly serving the City 
of Westland, he came to Garden City where 
he has remained a dedicated member of the 
Fire Department. Fire Marshal Smith discov-
ered his passion for fire prevention, com-
pleting the city’s Fire Inspector I and II and 
plans examiner training. He worked closely 
with the former Fire Marshal throughout his 
training, learning as much as possible before 
the retirement of his predecessor. 
I am honored to witness the swearing in of 
John Smith as Garden City Fire Marshal. 
Please join me in wishing him well in his new 
role, as we give thanks for his service to the 
people of Garden City in Michigan’s 13th Dis-
trict Strong.

HONORING HIS HOLINESS MIRZA 
MASROOR AHMAD VISIT TO THE 
UNITED STATES FOR THE INAU-
GURATION 
OF 
THE 
FATH-E- 
AZEEM MOSQUE 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 26, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today, I wish to recognize the visit of His Holi-
ness to the United States for the inauguration 
of the Fath-E-Azeem Mosque in Zion, Illinois. 
His Holiness is the worldwide spiritual head of 
the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, comprising 
millions of people residing in over 200 nations 
and territories. As the spiritual head of the 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, His Holiness 
tirelessly advocates for world peace, non-
violence, human rights, and justice. 
His Holiness was elected to his lifelong po-
sition on April 22, 2003, becoming the fifth 
Khalifa of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. 
As a result of his election, His Holiness was 
forced into exile from his home country of 
Pakistan due to repressive laws restricting the 
religious freedom of Ahmadi Muslims. Despite 
the persecution he and the Ahmadiyya Muslim 
Community continue to face, His Holiness for-
bids the use of violence and remains devoted 
to peace and nonviolence, a message of 
which he promotes through his public speak-
ing engagements, writings, and honorary visits 
across the globe. Furthermore, he’s an active 
voice in condemning the extremism and 
radicalization that has too often led to ter-
rorism. 
In 2004, His Holiness launched the National 
Peace Symposium to convene global leaders 
for discussions of global humanitarian and 
peacemaking efforts, while promoting a great-
er understanding of the role of Islam and other 
faiths in such efforts. He also established the 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize in 2009 as a 
recognition of those who have demonstrated 
an exceptional commitment to establishing 
world peace. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the dedicated 
global peace efforts of His Holiness Mirza 
Masroor Ahmad upon his historic visit to inau-
gurate the Fath-E-Azeem Mosque with the 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Zion, and I 
further honor the dedicated work of the 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community’s Zion Chapter 
to unite and serve Zion and the surrounding 
region. 
CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF 
DOVER ADULT LEARNING CENTER 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 26, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate 50 years of operation of the 
Dover Adult Learning Center (DALC), one of 
my state’s leaders in providing high quality 
education. For the past 50 years, DALC has 
supported community members to reach their 
full personal, educational, and career poten-
tials. Their efforts are ensuring our current and 
next generation grows up with the support and 
mentorship needed to live fulfilling lives. 
Since 1968, they have strengthened New 
Hampshire’s workforce and economy. Today, 
their multiple locations serve as one of the 
largest adult literacy populations in the state. 
DALC’s commitment to a respectful and re-
sponsive environment fosters life-long relation-
ships that lasts years after students graduate. 
They have proved an important reminder on 
the power of community in helping those over-
come educational and civic participation bar-
riers. Through education, training, and employ-
ment, DALC has become a respected leader 
in the learning space throughout the First Dis-
trict. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the dedicated staff at the Dover 
Adult Learning Center for Youth for their 50 
years of dedication to this important edu-
cational work.
