OFFICER 
(Mrs.

Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
thank you for your willingness to pre-
side over the Chamber at this late 
hour, at least in the Nation’s capital, 
midnight, here, or 10 o’clock in the 
great States of Colorado and Montana. 
My colleague and one of the lead 
sponsors of this legislation has been 
doing a lot of work this past week on 
the Great American Outdoors Act to 
make sure that we can get this across 
the finish line. The truly bipartisan 
spirit of this bill has been remarkable. 
I think that is kind of what I wanted to 
start off with my comments tonight, is 
really the coast-to-coast nature of this 
legislation, the Great American Out-
doors Act, because so many people

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2950 
June 12, 2020 
have put in not just a couple of weeks 
of work or a couple of months of work 
or a couple of years of work but dec-
ades of work on the legislation that we 
have before us. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
combines two pieces of legislation: the 
crown jewel of our conservation pro-
grams across the Nation, the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, and the Re-
store Our Parks Act. The Restore Our 
Parks Act focuses on the catching up 
with the maintenance backlog in our 
national park systems. 
About 70 percent of the funding, $1.9 
billion a year, will go towards our na-
tional parks. Additional dollars will go 
towards the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, the Bureau of Land Management 
now headquartered in the great State 
of Colorado. A portion will go to the 
U.S. Forest Service. A portion will go 
to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
and a portion will go to the Bureau of 
Indian Education. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, of course, goes toward the efforts 
to protect some of the greatest spaces 
in our Nation. I wanted to thank the 
people who have been working on 
this—and we have more work to do, to 
be clear—Senator MANCHIN, Senator 
HEINRICH, Senator CANTWELL, Senator 
KING, 
Senator 
WARNER, 
Senators 
PORTMAN and ALEXANDER, and Senator 
DAINES, all have been working very 
diligently to make sure that we can 
pass this. I am sure I missed a few peo-
ple, as we have talked about them to-
night and will be talking about this 
over the next several days. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund has benefited every State in the 
country. There are a few things that 
have been said on the floor today that 
I thought I would clear up and address 
because they need to be. I am going to 
show a chart here that talks about the 
States that will receive the benefit 
under the Great American Outdoors 
Act and the States that do not benefit 
from the Great American Outdoors 
Act. 
The States that do not benefit from 
the Great American Outdoors Act are 
highlighted in orange, and the States 
that benefit from the Great American 
Outdoors Act are highlighted in green. 
As you can see from this map, there 
are no orange States. This is an entire 
country—Alaska, 
Hawaii—48 
States 
that have benefited from the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, who will 
benefit from the Restore Our Parks 
Act. 
All 50 States across the country have 
already benefited from these programs. 
The March 9 letter begins: ‘‘The Land 
and Water Conservation Fund has been 
our nation’s most successful conserva-
tion and recreation program for 55 
years, now permanently reauthorized 
by Congress after a nationwide advo-
cacy effort.’’ 
That was a bill that came forward in 
the John D. Dingell conservation bill, 
the public land bill we passed last Con-
gress. It passed this Chamber 92 to 8, 
another extremely bipartisan provi-
sion. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund isn’t just about the coast. It is 
not just about the interior. It is about 
all of our States. Half the money goes 
to the East; half the money goes to the 
West. It is distributed across the Na-
tion. It is not a Federal land grab. I 
think it is important that some people 
want to talk about this being a Federal 
land grab. 
Ninety-nine percent of the funding 
from the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund actually goes to inholdings with-
in existing public lands, meaning if you 
have a place like Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park in Colorado—and there is a 
little bit of land somehow in the mid-
dle of that—Land and Water Conversa-
tion Fund—99 percent of the funds from 
that have been used to purchase those 
inholdings. 
You have a significant portion of the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
that is not managed by the Federal 
Government at all. It is actually han-
dled by the States. It is an important 
thing. It is baseball fields, soccer 
fields, and other programs the States 
can handle. So a huge chunk of funding 
from the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund goes back to the States and out 
of the hands of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
If you go to another letter we talked 
about before, the six previous Secre-
taries of the Interior sending a letter, 
June 3, 2020, talking about the privi-
lege and responsibility of stewarding 
some of America’s most scenic land-
scapes—incredible landscapes and nat-
ural and cultural treasures. 
It talked about how they are all cog-
nizant of the critical role our public 
lands play in our lives, with places to 
recreate, recharge, and to seek solace 
in the midst of great uncertainty and 
also to create jobs. This was signed by 
both Republican and Democrat Secre-
taries of the Interior, most recently 
Secretary Zinke and Secretary Jewell 
and Ken Salazar from Colorado; Sec-
retary Dirk Kempthorne; Secretary 
Gale Norton, another Coloradan; Sec-
retary Bruce Babbitt, from Arizona, 
under President Clinton. This talks 
about the importance of the Great 
American Outdoors Act with how it 
will help ensure a better, brighter fu-
ture for nature and for all of us. 
Speaking of sort of bright futures, 
some people have said on the floor that 
this legislation was crafted in secret. 
That couldn’t be further from the 
truth. The Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund has been around since 1965, 
1964, in this Chamber. It was approved 
by the committee just a couple of 
months ago. The Restore Our Parks 
Act cleared the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee just a couple of 
months ago. It was debated. There were 
amendments offered; they failed. 
We combined these two pieces that 
came out of committee, and we put 
them into the Great American Out-
doors Act. That is what we are being 
asked to vote on tonight. Of course, the 
Secretary’s letter talks about the dol-
lars that will be going to our commu-
nities, the opportunities for more con-
servation. We talked about the letter 
here from the coalition. 
Let’s 
talk 
about 
the 
jobs, 
too, 
though. It is important as we start vot-
ing tonight that we recognize that this 
is a jobs bill and an economic oppor-
tunity for our country. It is estimated 
that the Great American Outdoors Act 
will create over 100,000 jobs across the 
country. As we get our feet underneath 
us again, as we get back on our feet 
from the health pandemic, COVID–19 
emergency, we have a chance to create 
new jobs and new students. 
Remember where these jobs are going 
to be created; they are going to be cre-
ated around the country because Land 
and Water Conservation Fund is in 
nearly every county across the coun-
try. For every $1 million we spend on 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, we support between 16 and 30 
jobs. The national parks supports over 
100,000 jobs through the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act; the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, every $ 1 million, 
between 16 and 30 jobs. Those commu-
nities that have been impacted because 
of job loss—maybe their tourism sea-
son ended earlier, maybe it started 
late, maybe a combination of both as 
we faced in Colorado—those commu-
nities that have 20 percent, 22 percent, 
23 percent unemployment are going to 
be able to gain significant economi-
cally across the country thanks to this 
legislation. 
We also have a letter here from the 
Archery Trade Association, the Asso-
ciation of Fish and Wildlife, the Boone 
and Crockett Club, California Water-
fowl 
Association, 
Catch-A-Dream 
Foundation. You name it—Congres-
sional Sportsmen’s Foundation—from a 
March 11, 2020, letter in support of the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
The jobs aspect of the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, of course, is recog-
nized by the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce. On June 4, 2020, they sent a let-
ter to Members of the U.S. Senate. 
‘‘The 
U.S. 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce 
strongly supports [S. 3422], the ‘Great 
American Outdoors Act,’—an impor-
tant, bipartisan bill that would provide 
certainty for the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund [LWCF] and address the 
pressing maintenance and construction 
backlog on public lands.’’ 
It addresses long overdue infrastruc-
ture modernization challenges, inter-
national park system, and other Fed-
eral and agricultural lands. It would 
also permanently authorize the LWCF, 
providing an important tool for smart 
development of open spaces in commu-
nities across the Nation. 
Enactment of this bill would also 
provide much needed funding to sup-
port and sustain funding Bureau of In-
dian Education schools. By setting 
aside 5 percent of the funds created in 
this act, as much as $475 million could 
flow to Bureau of Indian Education 
schools over the next 5 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2951 
June 12, 2020 
API, the American Petroleum Insti-
tute, writes in support of the Great 
American Outdoors Act. They start 
with: ‘‘Practical, safe, and responsible 
offshore energy development doesn’t 
just create jobs and power our lives—it 
also funds America’s largest federal 
conservation program.’’ 
Senators will soon vote on the Great 
American Outdoors Act, and they hope 
that we would support this legislation. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
letters from the Chamber of Commerce 
and API. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JUNE 4, 2020. 
TO
THE MEMBERS
OF
THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
strongly supports S. 3422, the ‘‘Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act,’’ an important, bipar-
tisan bill that would provide funding cer-
tainty for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund (LWCF) and address the pressing main-
tenance and construction backlog on public 
lands. The Chamber will consider including 
votes related to this legislation in our ‘‘How 
They Voted’’ congressional scorecard. 
This bill would address long overdue infra-
structure modernization challenges in the 
national parks system and on other federal 
and agricultural lands. It also would perma-
nently authorize the LWCF, which provides 
important tools for smart development of 
open spaces in communities across our na-
tion. 
Local LWCF projects have the potential to 
put many thousands of Americans back to 
work as the American economy recovers 
from the pandemic. Such projects can also 
help companies and communities promote 
open spaces, build resilience, reduce risks 
from future disasters, and better manage 
stormwater. 
Enactment of this bill would also provide 
much needed funding to support and sustain 
Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools. 
By setting aside 5% of the fund created in 
this Act, as much as $475 million could flow 
to BIE schools over the next five years. 
The Chamber opposes any poison pill 
amendments that would undo the carefully 
balanced components of this legislation. In 
particular, the Chamber opposes any efforts 
to establish moratoria on energy production, 
which is not only crucial to America’s eco-
nomic growth and energy security, but also 
provides the underlying funding for the 
LWCF. 
We applaud the bipartisan leadership of 
Sens. Gardner, Manchin and Daines, who 
crafted this legislation. The Chamber urges 
passage of the Great American Outdoors Act. 
Sincerely, 
JACK HOWARD, 
Senior Vice President, 
Congressional 
and 
Public Affairs, U.S. 
Chamber 
of 
Com-
merce. 
JUNE 10, 2020. 
DEAR JENNIFER: Practical, safe, and re-
sponsible 
offshore 
energy 
development 
doesn’t just create jobs and power our lives— 
it also funds America’s largest federal con-
servation program. For decades, the natural 
gas and oil industry has directly contributed 
to outdoor recreation and environmental 
conservation, thanks to a long-standing law 
that would be strengthened by legislation 
that is up for a vote in the U.S. Senate. 
Senators will soon vote on S. 3422, the 
Great American Outdoors Act, a bipartisan 
bill that would codify a permanent funding 
stream for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund (LWCF) and address a considerable 
maintenance and construction backlog on 
public lands. 
Since 1965, LWCF grants have provided 
more than $4.4 billion for over 40,000 projects, 
supporting resource management, habitat 
restoration, and outdoor recreation such as 
hiking, hunting, and fishing. Offshore nat-
ural gas and oil royalties provide the pri-
mary source of funding for all LWCF 
projects, from the Grand Canyon National 
Park to community basketball courts. 
As summer starts and the coronavirus lim-
its the nation’s ability to convene inside, 
outdoor activities are more important than 
ever. Last month, API was happy to see the 
Interior Department announce a $227 million 
LWCF distribution to all 50 states, five U.S. 
territories, and the District of Columbia for 
specified park and outdoor recreation and 
conservation. 
But we won’t stop there. Energy producers 
are proud to grow the economy, create good- 
paying jobs, and invest in projects that en-
hance America’s natural beauty. Offshore en-
ergy revenues are essential to conserving the 
LWCF itself. 
Sincerely, 
MIKE SOMMERS, 
President & CEO, API. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
furthermore, to highlight the economic 
importance of this legislation, the out-
door recreation industry—these have 
some of the most notable names in out-
door recreation, which I think every-
body would recognize: Polaris, Bass 
Pro, 
Cabela’s—you 
name 
it—North 
Face, Patagonia. They are all on here, 
in support of the Great American Out-
doors Act. 
The outdoor recreation industry is ex-
tremely encouraged by recent announce-
ments that the Senate plans to hold a vote 
on the Great American Outdoors Act. As out-
door recreation business leaders, we know in-
vestments and recreation access and infra-
structure are vital to the outdoor recreation 
industry and economies across the country. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that this letter be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the material was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as fol-
lows: 
DEAR
LEADER
MCCONNELL
AND
LEADER 
SCHUMER: The outdoor recreation industry is 
extremely encouraged by recent announce-
ments that the Senate plans to hold a vote 
on the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) 
in June. As outdoor recreation business lead-
ers, we know investments in recreation ac-
cess and infrastructure are vital to the out-
door recreation industry and economies 
across the country. 
Prior to the COVID–19 outbreak, the out-
door recreation industry contributed $778 bil-
lion in economic output, accounted for 2.2 
percent of United States Gross Domestic 
Product, supported 5.2 million jobs and was 
growing faster than the economy as a whole 
in every indicator. Unfortunately, due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic and shutdowns nec-
essary to slow its progression, America’s 
outdoor recreation economy was hindered 
when we needed the outdoors more than 
ever. Outdoor Recreation Roundtable’s April 
survey of the sector shows that 79 percent of 
outdoor businesses have had to lay off or fur-
lough employees, and 89 percent are seeing 
decreased revenue. However, we know there 
is a bright future for outdoor recreation 
ahead, as several sectors of the industry are 
already experiencing rapidly increasing de-
mand. 
These outdoor businesses are the backbone 
of our industry and range from specialty re-
tailers, apparel, gear and vehicle manufac-
turers, outfitters and guides to campground 
and 
marina 
operators. 
They 
are 
often 
foundational to a community’s economy. 
With rising unemployment and Americans 
eager to experience the outdoors, investment 
in our industry’s core infrastructure—public 
lands and waters—will allow our businesses 
to get back to what we do best: stimulate 
local economies, put people back to work, 
and allow Americans to benefit from time 
spent outside. 
This is why we respectfully ask you to pass 
the Great American Outdoors Act as soon as 
possible. 
GAOA will fully fund the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund (LWCF) at $900 million 
annually, providing more recreation access 
for communities across the country and fuel-
ing more outdoor recreation economic activ-
ity. In a nutshell, if Congress invests the in-
tended amount of $900 million into LWCF 
recreation access projects on local, state and 
federal lands, it will create much-needed 
close-to-home recreation opportunities while 
revitalizing the outdoor recreation economy. 
Additionally, GAOA dedicates up to $9.5 
billion over the next five years to mainte-
nance backlog projects that have been dev-
astating our public lands and waters. Invest-
ing in these projects will improve outdoor 
recreation-related facilities such as docks, 
restrooms, campgrounds, trails, roads and 
more that have deteriorated significantly 
from decades of underfunded maintenance. 
As business leaders, we understand the need 
to make sure customers have good experi-
ences when they visit stores or facilities, it 
ensures they come back again. Funding the 
maintenance backlog will also ensure that 
adequate infrastructure for all types of 
recreation on our public lands and waters ex-
ists so more people who are seeking the ben-
efits the outdoors has to offer can get out-
side 
safely 
and 
grow 
our 
industry 
sustainably. 
Passing GAOA now would stimulate the 
outdoor recreation industry made up of 
thousands of businesses that support com-
munities in all SO states, support rural 
economies, create jobs to carry out essential 
work, and provide opportunities for millions 
of Americans to recreate on our public lands 
and waters for generations to come. We 
know this vital legislation is slated for a 
vote in the coming weeks and we urge you to 
move as quickly as possible to get this legis-
lation across the finish line. Your support of 
GAOA is a vote for American jobs and 
health, community resiliency and the out-
door recreation economy. Thank you for 
your leadership.

Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
REI—a place that Secretary Jewell 
knows very well—REI Co-op writes in 
support of the Great American Out-
doors Act, talking about the impres-
sive process that this bill came to-
gether with, the bipartisan nature of 
this legislation. 
My 
colleague, 
Senator 
HEINRICH, 
from New Mexico, is on the floor. I 
can’t thank him enough for the work 
we have done together and for making 
sure that we can get to these votes, as 
we approach very late hours in Wash-
ington. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a letter from REI Co-op, dated June 9, 
2020. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JUNE 9, 2020. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL
AND 
MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER: On behalf of REI 
Co-op, I want to express our strong support 
for the Great American Outdoors Act. This 
bipartisan legislation represents a historic 
opportunity to reduce the chronic mainte-
nance backlogs that have been diminishing 
our federal lands and waters. The bill also 
will make permanent Congress’s financial 
support for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, ending decades of erratic support. 
As you know, our public lands and waters 
are places for recreation, connecting to oth-
ers and even healing. This is true for Ameri-
cans across the country, irrespective of geog-
raphy, and has proven especially true over 
the last several months during the COVID–19 
pandemic. The connection between outdoor 
recreation and public health may have never 
been so evident as it is today. I strongly be-
lieve that these trends are part of a broader 
shift in our society and will remain in place 
well beyond the end of the pandemic, so long 
as we put healthy investment into this por-
tion of our public infrastructure. 
It’s also important to note how much the 
outdoor recreation economy has suffered 
during this economic downturn, in particular 
those small, main street businesses that rely 
on the public lands to be open and accessible. 
Most in our industry have not yet been 
deemed ‘‘essential businesses’’ and, there-
fore, have faced significant financial pres-
sures as store hours are cut and guided trips, 
cancelled. As of last fall, the U.S. Commerce 
Department had found the outdoor recre-
ation economy to account for 2.2.% of GDP 
and 5.2 million jobs. The recreation sector is 
not nearly so robust today. It will benefit 
greatly—both near and long term—from in-
vestments that better conserve our public 
lands and waters, and provide access to more 
outdoor recreation opportunities. 
Equally impressive is the process by which 
this bill has come together. Not long after 
last year’s passage of the landmark John D. 
Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and 
Recreation Act, Republicans and Democrats 
in your chamber came together to advance 
concepts that previously seemed impossible 
to move through Congress. Now, another his-
toric opportunity for bipartisanship is on the 
docket. In an era when divisive politics and 
disagreement regularly frustrate the legisla-
tive process, Congress’s commitment to the 
outdoors demonstrates our capacity to find 
common ground. 
As you continue to work through the im-
portant legislative agenda that is before the 
Senate, I urge you to pass the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act and look forward to this 
vital legislation becoming law. 
Sincerely, 
ERIC ARTZ, 
President & CEO, REI Co-op. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 
this is about national treasures, the 
great American outdoors. It is about 
national treasures. It is about pro-
tecting these incredible places that our 
own biologists—not just the people of 
Colorado or New Mexico or the great 
State of Georgia—owned by all of us. 
It is about some of the most scenic 
and majestic landscapes, unique eco-
systems that they create. But it is also 
about a national treasure and the 
American people. That national treas-
ure has been hit pretty hard over the 
last several months, with pandemics, 
conflict in our society, and racial in-
justice. It is this national treasure, the 
American people, that this legislation 
is focused on, the national treasure 
that will help create jobs and oppor-
tunity and empower people’s lives, get 
their communities back on track, and 
maybe—just maybe—provide a little 
bit of respite to somebody who is seek-
ing that opportunity to get outside, to 
get away, to find time to think. 
As Enos Mills said, to make them a 
little bit more reflective and kind dur-
ing difficult times. We have a long 
ways to go in this legislation. We will 
have more debates later tonight and a 
vote later tonight. I hope my col-
leagues will support me in this legisla-
tion. It is tremendously bipartisan in 
nature. It has significant support of 
the American people. It benefits our 
country from sea to shining sea. 
We are going to have some votes next 
week, on Monday, as well, and perhaps 
Tuesday, maybe even more. But one 
thing this bill is not is a surprise. This 
bill is a collection of debates and argu-
ments and passion and advocacy for 
decades. I think the argument has been 
won. We want to protect our country’s 
most treasured places. Now, we just 
have to win the debate and make sure 
we can do that with the bill tonight. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
yes tonight and through the remaining 
votes that we have either today or next 
week to move on to passage of this leg-
islation and the good it can do. I thank 
the President and I thank my col-
leagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I 
rise today with my colleagues from 
Colorado and Montana to talk about 
the incredible coalition that has come 
together to support the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act and why we have 
been able to build a group of folks 
ranging far beyond this body who have 
come together from very disparate 
parts of the political spectrum and 
very disparate parts of our incredible 
geographic country to support this 
piece of legislation. 
I think part of what has made this 
legislation so timely is what we have 
all been through in the last 3 months. 
Many of us were cooped up in our 
homes for weeks at a time, and it real-
ly drove home for all of us how incred-
ibly important the time that we get to 
spend outside is. I know some of my 
colleagues, particularly from the West, 
have been very articulate about that. 
I had a chance to travel around my 
State at a time when many people were 
still cooped up in their homes. Our 
State Governor was very thoughtful 
about the rules to make sure that even 
as people sought to socially distance 
themselves for weeks at a time, they 
were able to get access to their local 
parks, able to get access to open space, 
able to get access to our national for-
ests and BLM lands—anyplace, basi-
cally, where people could come to-
gether without coming together. There 
is no place like the great outdoors to 
do that. 
I would just ask my colleagues—I 
start with my colleague from Colo-
rado—if he would care to share some 
stories about the importance that we 
all learned about what we already 
have—and in many cases have because 
of the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund—in our own backyards and how 
important that was in the course of the 
greatest illness, the greatest pandemic 
of our generation’s time. 
I yield my time to the Senator from 
Colorado. 
Mr. GARDNER. I thank the Senator 
from New Mexico for his work on this 
legislation and the opportunity to con-
tinue to work together on the Great 
American Outdoors Act. We adjusted to 
the Zoom conference meetings and the 
Skypes and the FaceTimes. We all fig-
ured out our best way to do that. 
Millions of Americans were still at 
work each and every day at the gas 
station, at the grocery store, the clerks 
and the people stocking shelves and 
providing restaurant work across the 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2953 
June 12, 2020 
There is a lot of stress, and this is a 
tense time for this country. You can 
see it and hear it and still feel that 
strain on the American people. That 
sort of relief valve we have as a coun-
try is our system of parks and recre-
ation opportunities. 
It is about jobs. It is about the dol-
lars they spend in communities, the 
gateway communities, when they go to 
a place like Rocky Mountain National 
Park. Yet it is also about that oppor-
tunity for people to get away and to 
find that time to think, that time to be 
themselves, to focus, to get into an 
area where they can exercise, recreate, 
and enjoy the environment and the re-
sources around them. 
I make a joke; I don’t know if anyone 
else laughs at it. I talk about the last 
several months being spent in the great 
indoors. It is time for the great out-
doors. I think that is what we talked 
about. 
As a kid growing up, we had these 
road trips. We didn’t fly very often, at 
least. It was expensive. You would 
drive and drive great distances. You 
would drive to the Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park if you could or certainly 
drive up to Rocky Mountain National 
Park with the family. 
Maybe the great American road trip 
is going to come back as people adjust 
to what we have to do to protect our-
selves from the pandemic, as economic 
concerns grow in this country. This 
provides an opportunity for all of it. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Senator, if you would 
yield for a moment. 
To the Senator from Montana, I no-
tice a very similar dynamic emerging 
from Montana as it was from New Mex-
ico of being very thoughtful about a re-
sponse to the virus but also making 
sure that people could get out and just 
get that time for their physical well- 
being and their mental well-being even 
in the height of the pandemic. In doing 
that responsibly—and I think it cer-
tainly 
impressed 
upon 
everyone 
I 
talked to just how important these 
places have always been. Maybe some-
times we took them for granted, but I 
think the last 3 months have helped us 
not take the great American outdoors 
for granted. 
Mr. DAINES. I think that is exactly 
right, Senator HEINRICH. It is one of 
these unique moments tonight in the 
Senate where this body is coming to-
gether. 
Here we are—as Senator HEINRICH 
mentioned and Senator GARDNER has 
mentioned—we may disagree on var-
ious issues, but we are coming together 
tonight at a time when the Nation 
needs to come together to move this 
very important legislation forward. 
In Montana, we had cabin fever, as I 
am sure folks in New Mexico and Colo-
rado had as well. There were too many 
times on Zoom and not enough time 
outside. It has been good to see, as we 
have been through a phased opening in 
our State, like other States, people are 
getting back outside again and back 
into our national parks. 
I think about being a kid growing up 
in Montana. My earliest memories 
were literally when Mom and Dad 
would load us up in a pickup. Those 
were the days when you laid down in 
the back of a pickup. Kids rode in the 
back 
of 
the 
pickup. 
Nobody 
was 
strapped in. I am not suggesting this 
become the normal practice, but back 
in the day, we just rode in the back of 
the pickup. Mom and Dad would take 
us up to Cooke City, MT. Sometimes 
we would do day hikes out of there. 
Sometimes there were overnights on 
our public lands. 
You don’t realize how special that is 
when you are growing up until you re-
alize not everybody around the country 
has that kind of direct accessibility to 
our public lands. That is why more and 
more Americans are actually coming 
out West and why they want to be clos-
er to these amazing public lands that 
we are so grateful we have in places 
like New Mexico, Colorado, and Mon-
tana. 
We say in Montana that we get to 
work, but we also like to play. We 
work hard during the week, and I think 
we work hard so we can get out on the 
weekends, where there is hiking, fish-
ing, hunting, and backpacking. This is 
our life. 
These are pictures I have taken with 
my phone. The picture right here—we 
have three Mini Australian Shepherds. 
These are two of them. Our older dog, 
Jessie, has a hard time getting down 
the trails and mountains now, but the 
younger ones still can. 
We think about our fondest memories 
spending time outside on our public 
lands. It is why we continue to pre-
serve, protect, and expand that access 
to this incredible treasure we have in 
America. 
Mr. HEINRICH. I really think that 
our public lands are one of America’s 
greatest democratic accomplishments. 
You think about the fact of how we be-
came a nation. When you look at the 
history in Europe, people were locked 
out of the great lands of Europe. You 
look at all of the futile history that 
Europe had in wildlife and public lands. 
Lands and wildlife belonged to the 
King; they belonged to the Crown. If 
you were caught hunting on those 
lands, you could be put to death. You 
didn’t have access to those lands later 
in European history unless you could 
pay for them. 
Our forefathers were very thoughtful 
about not wanting that to be the same 
approach in the United States of Amer-
ica and making sure that our wildlife 
was held in trust for all of us and that 
these lands would be held in trust for 
all of us. 
One of the greatest things about the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, 
from my perspective, is that it really 
increased access to the national for-
ests, parks, and other places that had 
already been created. 
I would be curious if my colleagues 
have stories about particular places 
that didn’t have public access; that 
maybe for somebody just working in a 
small town, if there was an incredible 
mountain range or place you could 
hunt or fish or camp that was off lim-
its, and because of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, an easement or a 
trail or some other means of access was 
provided that opened it up to the work-
ing-class families of their constitu-
encies. We certainly have those stories 
in New Mexico. 
I would ask my colleagues if they 
have particular places in Colorado or 
Montana where that has been the case 
because of this incredibly important 
fund. 
Mr. DAINES. Senator HEINRICH, the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund has 
been such an important tool for us to 
provide access to the type of situation 
you just described. We have about 1.5 
million acres of Federal lands in Mon-
tana that are not accessible because 
they 
are 
landlocked. 
They 
are 
inholdings because of the complex na-
ture of the checkerboard ownership in-
frastructure that we oftentimes see out 
West—a section, 640 acres, a square 
mile. You have a State section, you 
have a Federal section, and you have a 
private land owner. This is working 
with willing landowners who want to 
work and find a way to consolidate 
some of these sections to provide bet-
ter access to the public lands. 
We have had some great projects, 
like the Tenderfoot project, we call it, 
over by the Smith River, which is a 
treasure in Montana. It is kind of the 
Montana bucket list, to float the 
Smith. It is an amazing several over-
nights from one point to the next, an 
over 50-mile kind of float. I did that 
once, and I would love to do it again. 
We had the Falls Creek acquisition 
that is outside of Augusta. By being 
able to provide access through a few 
hundred acres or a couple thousand 
acres, it gets the public into tens of 
thousands of acres of some prime elk 
habitat. 
This is where we bring together some 
of these great wildlife conservations, 
like the Rocky Mountain elk conserva-
tion, that see these tools as critical to, 
one, help protect and expand elk habi-
tat, but importantly, Montana is still 
one of those States where a mom or a 
dad, grandma or grandpa, aunt or uncle 
can take a son or a daughter, a niece or 
a nephew or a cousin down to Walmart 
and buy an elk tag or a deer tag over 
the counter and jump back in the pick-
up and go to our public lands within an 
hour, sometimes even a shorter time 
than that. 
That is something, as you mentioned, 
Senator HEINRICH— 
Mr. HEINRICH. You are saying you 
don’t have to hire a guide; you don’t 
have to spend $10,000 on a private land 
tag? You can just buy an elk tag over 
the counter and go out and pursue elk 
on your public lands? 
Mr. DAINES. It is—every State has 
its own philosophy and ways they are 
going to manage wildlife, but in Mon-
tana, in many cases, it is an over-the-

counter tag. We have special draws. 
Antelope is still a draw. There are 
some places for elk and deer that are a 
draw, but in most cases, for elk and 
deer or a bear, you can go and buy that 
tag over the counter. That is very 
unique. 
As you mentioned, Senator HEINRICH, 
it is so different from Europe. What 
sets our country apart—while Europe 
may have beautiful castles and cha-
teaux and chefs and so forth, what we 
have are national parks and our public 
lands. As you mentioned, it is some-
thing our forefathers had the vision 
for. They went before us and set that 
aside. Had they not done that—you 
never get that back. Had that not been 
put in the hands of the public, we 
wouldn’t have Yellowstone National 
Park or Glacier National Park. They 
are such beautiful places. They would 
have been subdivided. They would have 
been privately held, and the public 
couldn’t enjoy these treasures. I am 
grateful for that legacy. We get to 
work on it here tonight, to continue to 
maintain it well and be better stewards 
of these public lands. 
Mr. HEINRICH. You mention Yellow-
stone. We have a place in northern New 
Mexico that many people refer to as 
New Mexico’s Yellowstone, because, 
like Yellowstone, it is a high elevation 
caldera. It is a place where there was a 
supervolcano, and that supervolcano 
collapsed in on itself. When it did, it 
created 
what 
they 
call 
a 
reverse 
treeline, a series of very high elevation 
meadows connected to each other with 
a ring of mountains around them. Near 
the caldera there is a huge elk herd, 
hot springs, and wild trout. 
That place is called the Valles 
Caldera National Preserve today. It 
was actually first proposed as a na-
tional park, I think, in about 1916, if 
you can believe that. 
Almost to the month, 100 years later, 
we were able to make this a national 
preserve, which is like a National Park 
Service property that also allows for 
hunting and fishing. We did that be-
cause the family who had been a great 
steward of that land for decades had 
decided that they needed to sell it, but 
they wanted to see it preserved. What 
came to the rescue in that case was the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, in 
one of the largest acquisitions of pri-
vate land from a willing private sell-
er—an enthusiastic private seller to 
the public trust. 
Today this is an 89,000-acre national 
preserve that anyone in the United 
States can visit. Once again, anyone 
with a hunting license can apply for an 
elk tag there, can go fishing there. It is 
just a remarkable, remarkable place. 
It would never have happened and 
this would be covered in vacation 
homes if it were not for that tool. 
Mr. GARDNER. In Colorado, I think I 
mentioned before, we have an area the 
size of Rocky Mountain National Park 
that is held by the public across the 
State of Colorado, but it is inacces-
sible. You can’t get to it. The Land and 
Water Conservation Fund provides this 
opportunity to get to that, to access 
land. 
I heard my colleague Senator DAINES 
talk about how a significant portion of 
the fishing access in Montana—he just 
talked about it—is through the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. 
We have projects in the Rio Grande 
National Forest through portions of 
Colorado and into Texas, where the 
Lower Rio Grande Valley National 
Wildlife Refuge has benefited. I think 
it was Will Rogers who once said that 
the Rio Grande was the only river he 
ever saw that was in need of irrigation. 
I think if you look at the Land and 
Water 
Conservation 
Fund, 
that 
is 
something we can all benefit from. 
Of course, while we don’t directly 
border Montana, we do border New 
Mexico. There was an article recently 
featured, I think, by the Nature Con-
servancy, 
about 
Colorado’s 
newest 
State park. It is in southern Colorado, 
right outside a little town called Trini-
dad, and it will encompass a local land-
mark known as Fisher’s Peak. 
Trinidad has a great and amazing 
history in the West, from mining to ag-
riculture and the challenges that min-
ing and agriculture have posed over the 
years, and forestry and other things. 
But what they are hoping for now is 
that this newest State park can pro-
vide an opportunity for economic revi-
talization of this rural town and area. 
It is actually going to border right up 
against New Mexico, and part of that 
special land goes into New Mexico. 
Maybe someday the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund will be able to ben-
efit that project. In fact, I know they 
are working on it, and they have re-
ceived it by now. It is an opportunity 
for us to save rural communities. 
This Land and Water Conservation 
Fund is not all out of Washington. It is 
coming through the States as well, and 
that is an opportunity for both of our 
areas to prosper, particularly our rural 
communities. 
Mr. HEINRICH. As my colleague 
from Montana said—let me back up 
just a moment. The folks in Raton are 
also very excited about what is going 
on at Fisher’s Peak and looking at dif-
ferent possibilities for their commu-
nity just over the divide from Trinidad. 
One of the places, as my colleague 
from Montana described them, is tak-
ing public lands that literally are held 
in trust for all of us, but some of them 
you just can’t get to anymore, because 
of lands changing hands over the years, 
private land acquisitions and county 
road closures at times. Sometimes you 
can find yourself in these positions 
where something as large as 10,000 
acres or 15,000 acres of public land can 
find itself cut off from any legal access 
to the public. 
In New Mexico, we actually had the 
country’s only designated wilderness 
area where, simply, there was no legal 
public access. There was not a trail, 
not a road. There was no way to get 
there. In recent years, we were able to 
work with the Secretaries of the Inte-
rior, and using the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, we were able to 
open up and expand that. Today people 
are able to hike, camp, and hunt. It has 
a little water in it, but I don’t know 
anybody who has actually fished there. 
But it is a labyrinth of canyons and 
rim rock country similar to what most 
people would associate with Utah. I can 
tell you that the community in Las 
Vegas nearby and in other smaller 
communities are really just very ex-
cited about the opportunities for tour-
ism and for access for sportsmen to a 
place that had been completely inac-
cessible. 
I see we have been joined by our col-
league from West Virginia, whom I 
know has some really strong feelings 
about the potential of outdoor recre-
ation in his State. I didn’t realize how 
many—13,000 peaks in West Virginia— 
but I looked in his office today, and 
there is a whole mountain chain in 
West Virginia. 
To our colleague, Senator MANCHIN of 
West Virginia, do you want to join us 
and talk a little bit about the impor-
tance of outdoor recreation and what 
this legislation might mean in your 
State? 
Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Senator, 
and to all my colleagues, I want to 
thank you. I appreciate very much the 
job that has been done here. By work-
ing in a bipartisan spirit, every one of 
us benefits from this. This is a legacy 
piece of legislation that, hopefully, our 
children and generations to come will 
say that it was my grandfather, my fa-
ther, my uncle, my aunt who was in-
volved in giving me an opportunity to 
enjoy part of the America that maybe 
I may not have had. We have access to 
it. 
In West Virginia, when you get ac-
cess to New River or the Gauley, it has 
been provided by LWCF money. The 
Park System that we have—and we 
have hundreds of thousands of visitors 
every year—is done because of the Re-
store Our Parks Act, and people are 
now able to come. 
Just about 4 or 5 months ago, I took 
my family, and we were in Hawaii. 
When Senators and Congress people go 
into Hawaii on a codel, we usually 
don’t see what the visitors see down 
there. They don’t take us to the visi-
tors’ center. This time I had gone as a 
normal visitor, and when I walked in, I 
was appalled at what I saw. 
The maps were falling off the wall. 
The lights weren’t working. It was 
atrocious. 
I had a meeting with the staff right 
there. I came back, and at that time, 
David Bernhardt, Rob Walls, and I 
started talking, and I said: Gentlemen, 
that is the birthplace, basically, defin-
ing who we are as a superpower and the 
hope of the world, and for our veterans 
to have to come and see that and say 
this is where it began, something had 
to be done. We started right then ren-
ovating and fixing it up, and I think we 
spent $10 million out of the contin-
gency fund. So I know what it takes for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2955 
June 12, 2020 
Senator ALEXANDER, who has led this 
fight, and Senator WARNER and others 
as well on Restore Our Parks. 
Teddy Roosevelt would be proud of 
Senator ALEXANDER leading this charge 
and all of us working together. Putting 
these two bills together was a master 
stroke, I believe, and how we could 
come together. It has brought us all to-
gether. There is not one person I be-
lieve—we have a few of our friends that 
have some challenges, and we are going 
to help them through as soon as we get 
this bill passed. But in West Virginia, 
this means the world for us. It has ben-
efited our State since 1965, and 54 out 
of 55 counties have benefited by it. 
Now, I tell them that whatever you 
think we have been able to do and how-
ever happy you are with what has hap-
pened, we can do twice as much. We 
can do twice as much on a regular 
basis. 
I am proud to be a part of this. Sen-
ator HEINRICH and I have worked to-
night, and our staffs have worked 
closely, and Senator DAINES and GARD-
NER
and everybody is working very 
close on this. It pulled us together, and 
I hope we can stay together and keep 
this spirit of bipartisanship in many 
pieces of legislation. 
So thank you. Thank you for letting 
me be involved, and thank you for 
what you have done. 
Mr. HEINRICH. I think what we have 
all learned is what a great team this 
has been and, obviously, it is a land 
fund—the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. It means boat ramps and ac-
cess and many other things. We will 
continue to work together to make 
sure that all of our States benefit from 
this program, not just a few, and I 
know my colleague from Montana 
wants to add a few more points to this 
conversation. 
Mr. DAINES. Thanks, Senator HEIN-
RICH. 
I am going to hand this over to the 
Senator from Ohio, as well as our Sen-
ator from Tennessee, where it is so im-
portant to the Restore Our Parks Act. 
I know we have a lot to talk about in 
our national parks. 
I want to add one point, Senator 
HEINRICH, about what you mentioned 
around the economic benefits. Seventy 
percent of the fishing access that is in 
Montana has been funded by the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund—70 per-
cent. As a kid growing up, I had a fly 
rod in my hand back in the early 1970s 
before fly fishing became very popular. 
My grandpa and my dad would take me 
out, not unlike in ‘‘The River Runs 
Through It.’’ 
That is a classic movie. When Robert 
Redford and Brad Pitt came out to 
Montana 
and 
filmed 
this 
amazing 
movie, it was filmed on the Gallatin 
River, where I grew up fishing as a kid, 
in Bozeman. Little did we know what a 
movie like that and fishing access 
might do to spur our fly fishing indus-
try in Montana. Now our outdoor recre-
ation economy is $7 billion in Montana. 
What started out as access for the pub-
lic 
and 
primarily 
Montanans 
has 
turned into something that is an eco-
nomic driver, as others want to share 
the amazing experiences we have in 
places like Montana, on our rivers and 
seeing a trout on a fly line. It is an im-
portant economic driver. 
Mr. HEINRICH. This has been a spon-
taneous colloquy, but I think the time 
has come for us to give back our time. 
But I want to thank my colleagues for 
their incredible support, and I think 
folks are going to take over the floor 
as we move in to the next phase here. 
Mr. 
DAINES. 
I 
want 
Senator 
PORTMAN from Ohio to speak. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Senator PORTMAN 
from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Thank you, Senator 
HEINRICH. Thanks to my colleagues for 
being here. This is an opportunity to 
do the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund expansion and provide fishing ac-
cess through our States and local com-
munities and the parks that they need 
and want, but it is also an opportunity 
to fix our parks, and this is desperately 
needed. 
Our national parks are in trouble, 
just as more and more people are re-
turning to our parks for recreation and 
fishing and all the other access we 
have. There are 84 million acres of true 
treasures in America, thanks to Teddy 
Roosevelt and many others who fol-
lowed in his footsteps. We preserved 
this land and protected our history, but 
there is a $12.5 billion maintenance 
backlog in our parks. 
As visitors go to our parks as they 
reopen this summer, they will find that 
the trail is closed or the toilet doesn’t 
work or the lodge has a leak in the 
roof, and therefore they can’t use it. 
When you get a leak in the roof and 
you get the mold in the walls and the 
floor, that is what is happening, and we 
haven’t funded it. 
Part of the reason is it is so expen-
sive. These are infrastructure expendi-
tures that require significant funds. So 
part of what this legislation does is fi-
nally allow us to catch up here in the 
U.S. Congress. It is a debt unpaid. In 
other words, we should have been pay-
ing all over these many years to ensure 
this wouldn’t happen but, unfortu-
nately, for decades it has. 
So some of the funds we use here go 
directly into these parks and also to 
our Forest Service and wildlife refuges 
and our lands and our Native American 
lands. This is to simply stop the ero-
sion, really, of the beauty of our parks 
and to eliminate this historic level of 
backlog of maintenance projects. So we 
appreciate the fact that tonight we 
have an opportunity to finally begin to 
change our approach and to switch 
gears. 
I want to thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for helping us to 
get to this point. It has been through 
our committee twice, with lots of 
amendments that have been amended 
and debated, and lots of discussion. We 
now have an opportunity to make good 
on the promise we have made to our 
children and grandchildren that these 
parks will be preserved for future gen-
erations. 
My colleagues with whom I worked 
include Senator WARNER, who came up 
with this idea saying some of funds 
coming from offshore oil and gas and 
other energy projects could be diverted 
to these national parks to provide ade-
quate resources to do this. We will see 
him on the floor this evening, and pos-
sibly Senator ALEXANDER, who has 
been at this as well and is a key player, 
and also Senator ANGUS KING. The four 
of us stuck together through thick and 
thin. I hope tonight will be the thin 
part and we can get this done over the 
next several days so that we can indeed 
keep the promise that we have made 
that these national treasures can be 
preserved. 
Senator ALEXANDER, do you have 
something you would like to say? 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
in the middle of the Great Depression, 
the people in Tennessee and North 
Carolina looked around and said: Why 
are all the national parks out West? 
So Tennessee contributed $2 million, 
and North Carolina contributed $2 mil-
lion, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. said: 
I will give $5 million in honor of my 
mother if you can match it. The chil-
dren of North Carolina and Tennessee 
in schools raised another million dol-
lars in community efforts, and the 
Great 
Smokey 
Mountain 
National 
Park was created and given to the peo-
ple of the United States. 
So the people of Tennessee and North 
Carolina gave that to the United 
States and, today, more than 12 million 
Americans visit it. There are a lot 
more people who visit it than live in 
Tennessee and North Carolina, and 
part of the deal was that there would 
be no entrance fee. The one thing that 
we wanted or our grandparents wanted 
at the time was that the American peo-
ple be good stewards of what we gave 
to the American people. 
Today, thanks to the leadership of 
Senators 
WARNER, 
PORTMAN, 
KING, 
MANCHIN, HEINRICH, DAINES, and GARD-
NER on the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, that has happened. I am 
proud to be a part of it. This is the 
most significant piece of conservation 
legislation in at least a half century, 
and it represents a recognition by the 
American people that we can be good 
stewards of what Ken Burns has called 
‘‘our greatest idea,’’ our national parks 
and our remaining public lands. 
Mr. HEINRICH. When we pass this 
legislation, I think we are going to 
show them that we are going to be 
good stewards of the Great Smokey 
Mountain National Park, as well as 
parks across our country. 
I know that the Nation’s newest na-
tional park is in New Mexico, and it is 
White Sands. Yet we have a set of rest-
rooms that sit on top of a sinkhole and 
for far too long have needed repair. 
That is the kind of thing I think we 
will be able to repair all across our 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2956 
June 12, 2020 
I don’t see our colleague Senator 
KING of Maine yet, but he oftentimes 
speaks to the fact that what Senator 
ALEXANDER and Senator PORTMAN de-
scribe in our deferred maintenance is 
truly debt. Deferred maintenance is 
debt, and we are going to take respon-
sibility for that and really treat our 
parks the way they deserve and work 
to extend the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund at the same time. 
Mr. Chair, with that I think I will 
give back the rest of our time, and I 
want to thank all of my colleagues for 
joining me in the colloquy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. We have a few min-
utes left to go. I didn’t realize the col-
loquy was going on. I would like to 
give an opposing viewpoint. 
In this legislation, we put parks over 
people. We spend billions of dollars 
taking care of parks and don’t spend a 
dime taking care of those folks who 
live in those parishes and counties next 
to a coastline. It turns out that 42 per-
cent of Americans live in a parish or 
county next to a coastline, and if you 
haven’t noticed, we increasingly have 
flood events. We increasingly have 
spent billions of dollars rescuing people 
from floods, repairing their homes 
afterwards, and trying to make them 
whole. 
Now, we could have put legislation in 
this legislation that would allow those 
people’s needs to be met, but we are 
putting parks before people, and that is 
a tragedy. We are going to spend bil-
lions on places where we go on vaca-
tion, but we will not spend a dime 
where we live—where we live—where 
we raise our children, where we help 
other people make a living. 
In this—particularly since we know 
that sea levels are rising—we are going 
to increasingly have these events. We 
are, if you will, being—I don’t know 
how to put it—blind to the reality that 
is before us. 
And someone mentioned outhouses 
on top of a sinkhole—what a tragedy. 
Do you know what really a tragedy is? 
When someone—no, when many peo-
ple—when whole swaths of a city are 
flooded out—that is a tragedy. 
And we are out of time, but I will fin-
ish by this: I will feel a lot better about 
this Senate at the point in which we 
begin to put people over parks and 
spend at least something where people 
live as opposed to where people vaca-
tion—not to take any money away 
from the parks but to just put some 
money to where people live. 
I yield the floor. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). Pursuant to rule XXII, the 
Chair lays before the Senate the pend-
ing cloture motion, which the clerk

CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the

other purposes, shall be brought to a 
close?

MORNING BUSINESS 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO AUBREE ROOT 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Aubree Root of Richland County for 
her academic achievements and desire 
to give back to her community. 
Aubree is a graduate of Fairview 
High School and plans to attend Minot 
State University to study psychology 
and art in the fall. She has a desire to 
use her education to eventually work 
with children who have experienced 
trauma once she graduates from col-
lege. 
Aubree was awarded a scholarship by 
the ROI Foundation. The ROI Founda-
tion selects a Richland County grad-
uating senior every year who plans to 
pursue a career in the field of special 
education, psychology, or any related 
field having to do with human services. 
Scholarship 
recipients 
are 
selected 
based on their academic standing, their 
involvement in the community, and 
their desire to work with those with in-
tellectual, physical, mental, or emo-
tional disabilities. 
It is my honor to recognize Aubree 
for receiving this distinguished schol-
arship. Her selfless desire to receive an 
education in order to support those in 
challenging situations exemplifies the 
Montana spirit of serving others. I look 
forward to following Aubree’s future 
accomplishments, and I congratulate 
her for receiving this honor.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING TOM JOHNSON 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today I rise to honor and pay tribute to 
my friend, neighbor, and mentor Tom 
Johnson, who passed away on June 8, 
2020, after a 6-year fight with cancer. 
Tom served as the Hennepin County 
attorney for 12 years, and after I took 
over as county attorney years later, I 
would often turn to him for advice. 
Tom was always willing to help and to 
offer his wisdom, humor, and always 
patient kindness. 
It is only fitting that Tom was work-
ing up until his final days as to how to 
improve the lives of others by pro-
posing ideas on criminal justice re-
form. In fact, just 1 week before he

died, Tom attended a virtual board 
meeting of the Minnesota Justice Re-
search Center, which he founded and 
which was dedicated to pursuing fair 
treatment for those in the criminal 
justice system. 
Tom was a groundbreaking leader on 
criminal justice reform for decades and 
a fierce advocate for ending the racial 
disparities that have plagued our judi-
cial system. Last Christmas, Tom 
wrote his own obituary, in which he 
said that nothing had given him more 
satisfaction than ‘‘calling attention to 
the unacceptable racial disparities in 
the justice system and their cost to so-
ciety.’’ 
His voice and wisdom on these issues 
will be deeply missed in this moment 
as we try to end systemic racism in our 
country with systemic change. 
Put simply, Tom always did good, 
from his critical work on domestic 
abuse, to his focus on race and justice, 
to his principled stand against the 
death penalty. He simply loved public 
service. 
Tom was elected to the Minneapolis 
City Council at just 28 years old, and 
he once wrote that he used to wander 
around city hall thinking ‘‘If the public 
only knew how little I know.’’ But de-
spite, or perhaps, because of his humil-
ity, Tom got things done. 
Tom fought for truth-in-housing in-
spections and campaign finance disclo-
sures and for a prohibition of discrimi-
nation based on sexual orientation. He 
founded CornerHouse, an advocacy cen-
ter for child victims of sexual abuse. 
Tom was a tireless advocate and 
champion for all Minnesotans, but 
none gave him more joy than his be-
loved family, including his wife Vic-
toria and his children Jill, Ben, Hun-
ter, and Kayla. He was so proud of all 
they had achieved—and rightfully so. 
When reflecting on his legacy to the 
Star Tribune in 2015, Tom suggested 
that many of today’s problems could be 
solved if people just worked harder at 
getting to know people from different 
races and cultures. As he told the 
paper, things like ‘‘socializing after 
work. Asking how things are going and 
really listening to the answer. Helping 
a young person make the connections 
that lead to a first job,’’ were the keys. 
We would all be wise to honor Tom’s 
legacy by heeding that advice.∑
