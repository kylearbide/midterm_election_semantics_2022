PRAYER 
Reverend Philip Ganir, S.J., Gonzaga 
Jesuit Community, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer: 
Loving God, source of all healing and 
hope, thank You for the leaders and 
the diverse people this House rep-
resents, for strength of mind and body, 
and for the gift of freedom in our coun-
try. 
Send Your spirit, Lord, to guide our 
leaders’ work this day. May their labor 
bring greater justice, peace, and heal-
ing, especially to those who suffer 
most. 
During this time of election, give all 
of us wisdom to discern wisely. Align 
our work with the freedom which de-
fines and sustains us. In the face of dis-
agreement, ground us in civility. When 
discouragement looms, let the spirit of 
mercy, and even a sense of humor, re-
mind us of our humanity. And when 
the goals for the common good seem 
distant, inspire courage in all of us to 
act justly, mindful that Your good 
gifts become more apparent when we 
seek unity and peace. 
Amen.

HONORING SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 
SHERIFF 
MARCO 
ANTONIO 
ESTRADA, SR. 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Santa Cruz County 
Sheriff Marco Antonio Estrada, Sr. for his dec-
ades of public service to Nogales, AZ. The 
only Hispanic and longest serving Sheriff in 
the State of Arizona is retiring after a com-
bined career of over 50 years in law enforce-
ment. 
A native to Ambos Nogales, Sheriff Estrada 
was born in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. In De-
cember of 1944, his family immigrated to the 
United States and made their home in 
Nogales, Arizona. Sheriff Estrada grew up 
from humble beginnings, and his family often 
struggled to put food on the table. With a tre-
mendous work ethic, drive, and self-education 
through avid reading, he overcame poverty. 
Sheriff Estrada’s law enforcement career 
began in 1966 when he first joined the 
Nogales Police Department as a radio dis-
patcher. He continued to move up the ranks 
with promotions to Desk Sergeant, then serv-
ing as Captain from 1978 up to his retirement 
in 1991. 
In 1992, he decided to continue his public 
service career and ran for The Office of Santa 
Cruz County Sheriff. He was elected and 
sworn in on January 1, 1993. Since then, 
Sheriff Estrada has been re-elected for seven 
consecutive terms and is finishing his ‘‘last 
rodeo’’, as he so famously called it, with a dis-
tinguished legacy of service to Santa Cruz 
County. A proud immigrant himself, he always 
promoted the welfare of immigrants and is an 
advocate for the border town. One of his most 
notable accomplishments was the construction 
of a new sheriff’s department and county jail 
named after him: ‘‘Tony Estrada Law Enforce-
ment Center.’’ His long exemplary career in 
law enforcement counts mainly accolades; 
however, as our country currently faces ten-
sions between communities and local law en-
forcement, his greatest accomplishment could 
arguably be the longstanding positive relation-
ship maintained between the local law en-
forcement agency and its community under his 
leadership. As a Sheriff who made it a point, 
not only to enforce the law with strength, but 
to also enforce the law with compassion, em-
pathy, integrity, dedication, commitment and 
passion; it’s understandable why residents 
identify Marco Antonio Estrada, Sr. as a Sher-
iff who truly reflects the values of their small 
border town. Sheriff Estrada publicly defended 
those values and the people of Santa Cruz 
County against those who would demean the 
community. 
Sheriff Estrada also understood the impor-
tance of serving and giving back to his com-
munity after hours. He actively volunteers his 
time to many community-based organizations 
that include: United Way of Santa Cruz Coun-
ty (serving as a spokesperson for over three 
decades), the Boys and Girls Club, the 
Nogales Rotary Club, the Kiwanis Club, Way 
of the Heart Promotora Institute, Nogales Elks 
Lodge, is a lifetime member of the Fraternal 
Order of Police, and has always supported 
charitable organizations. 
Congratulations on a job well done and time 
well served, my friend. You are a hero to your 
family and community and an example of 
good policing. There will never be another 
Sheriff Estrada (Sr.), but the bar has been set 
high for The Office of Santa Cruz County 
Sheriff.

HONORING DESHAUNTRA GREEN- 
JOHNSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Deshauntra 
Green-Johnson, a Fayette native and junior at 
the University of Mississippi. She was recently 
selected to participate in the undergraduate 
portion of the Mississippi Rural Physicians 
Scholarship Program (MRPSP). Deshauntra is 
the daughter of Hugh and Guy Green. 
The MRPSP identifies college sophomores 
and juniors who demonstrate the necessary 
commitment and academic achievement to be-
come competent, well-trained rural primary 
care physicians in the state of Mississippi. The 
program offers undergraduate academic en-
richment and a clinical experience in a rural 
setting. Upon completion of all the medical 
school admission requirements, the student 
can use the scholarship at the University of 
Mississippi School of Medicine or William 
Carey University College of Osteopathic Medi-
cine. 
Upon completion of medical school, MRPSP 
scholars must enter a residency program in 
one of five primary care specialties: family 
medicine, general internal medicine, pediat-
rics, medicine-pediatrics, or obstetrics/gyne-
cology. The MRPSP Scholar must provide four 
years of service in a clinic-based practice in 
an approved Mississippi community of 15,000 
or fewer population located more than 20 
miles from a medically served area. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me 
in 
recognizing 
and 
congratulating 
Deshauntra Green-Johnson on her accept-
ance into the Mississippi Rural Physicians 
Scholarship Program at the University of Mis-
sissippi. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
KENNETH E. JONES 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of Mr. Kenneth E. Jones of 
Whitley County. 
Next week, on Sunday, November 1, Mr. 
Jones will celebrate his 100th birthday. To Mr. 
Jones: congratulations on this wonderful occa-
sion. I hope his heart is filled with joy knowing 
he has experienced our country’s greatest 
blessings, including the affection of family and 
friends over a long, well-lived life. 
Our Nation owes Mr. Jones a tremendous 
debt of gratitude for his dedicated service to 
our country in the United States Navy during 
World War II. Serving as a landing craft oper-
ator in the South Pacific, his sacrifices were 
critical to the defense of our homeland and 
ensured security and prosperity for millions of 
people. 
As the oldest veteran in Whitley County, I, 
and the entirety of Congress, send Mr. Jones 
best wishes as he celebrates this historic mile-
stone. 
Mr. Jones’ legacy of service is a proud part 
of our Nation’s remarkable story. This record 
is a testament to his commitment to the Amer-
ican people and ideals to which our Nation 
strive.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOREST 
PRODUCTS WEEK 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize National Forest Prod-
ucts Week. 
This week is important to celebrate because 
it honors the role of forest landowners who are 
the unsung heroes and stewards of America’s 
forests. 
Because of their work, they have made the 
United States the world’s number one wood 
producer, providing nearly half of the global 
supply of wood fiber. 
Well-managed forests supply the wood and 
fiber essential to the production of everyday 
goods we all depend on. 
As the representative for Georgia’s coast 
and an avid outdoorsman, I recognize the im-
portance of sustainable forestry. 
Private landowners’ sustainable practices of 
planting, growing, and harvesting trees for do-
mestic wood supply leads to increased job op-
portunities in the forest supply chain, as well 
as a decreased dependence on foreign im-
ports. 
In Georgia, forest landowners’ contributions 
are critical to domestic supply chains. They

REMEMBERING BISHOP LEE WARD 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember and honor Bishop Lee Ward, the 
former senior pastor of Greater Harvest 
Church of God in Christ in Memphis, who 
passed on Tuesday at the age of 97. Bishop 
Ward, a native of Abbeville, Alabama, joined 
the Marine Corps in April 1943 and was later 
recognized with a 2012 Congressional Gold 
Medal as one of the remaining 362 Montfort 
Point Marines for their service during World 
War II. On the reverse of that cherished medal 
reads this inscription: ‘‘For Outstanding Perse-
verance and Courage that Inspired Social 
Change in the Marine Corps.’’ Bishop Ward 
went on to serve in the Korean and Vietnam 
Wars in 26 years with the Marines, retiring as 
a master gunnery sergeant. As pastor of 
Greater Harvest COGIC, Bishop Ward served 
for 42 years before turning over his legacy to 
his son, Elder Renardo Ward. I express my 
condolences to Bishop Ward’s wife, Julia, his 
children and grandchildren, his many friends 
and the entire Greater Harvest and COGIC 
community. Bishop Ward led an exemplary 
life, and he will be missed.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DONNA 
ANCINEC 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the passing of Donna Ancinec 
of Dearborn Heights, Michigan. Donna was a 
noted civic leader, a beloved member of her 
community, a mother, and a friend. She will be 
missed by all who had the privilege of knowing 
her. We offer condolences to her family and 
friends who are grieving this terrible loss while 
also celebrating her life, her many accomplish-
ments, and the impact she had on those who 
knew her. 
Donna was a noted public servant, as she 
first began her service on the Crestwood 
School Board in 2001 and served as president 
for 15 years, until her passing. Her passion for 
students, education, and improving the lives of 
young people was unparalleled, and she 
served the people of Dearborn Heights with 
distinction during her 20 years on the board. 
Many changes happened during that time, and 
Donna was always there to serve as a steady 
hand, guiding the school district into the digital 
age and always putting the interests of stu-
dents first. For 20 years, as thousands of chil-
dren passed through the halls of Crestwood 
Schools and began their journey into adult-
hood, they have Donna Ancinec to thank for 
providing the foundation of their education. For 
Donna, public service was not a means to an 
end but a calling to serve those in her commu-
nity. Her dedication to education and improv-
ing the lives of young people will never be for-
gotten. 
Donna loved her community in Dearborn 
Heights, and her community cherished the role 
she played in their lives. Besides serving on 
the school board, Donna always took the time 
to be there for her extended network of family 
and friends. She was very proud of her Mal-
tese heritage and was an active member of 
the Detroit Chapter of the Maltese American 
Benevolent Society. Large gatherings at her 
home were frequent and that sense of com-
munity and love that she brought to her life 
will be sorely missed by those who knew her 
well. Donna is survived by her son, Joseph, 
and her daughter, Emily. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Donna Ancinec. She 
left this world too early, but her kind, loving 
nature will never be forgotten by those who 
knew her.

CONGRESSIONAL RECOGNITION OF 
SGT. JOHN POHLMAN 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to seek posthumous Congressional 
Recognition for former Houston Police Ser-
geant John G. Pohlman, who passed away at 
the age of 77 on October 12, 2020, after a 
long battle with pulmonary fibrosis. Sgt. 
Pohlman was a dedicated father and husband, 
who is survived by his beloved wife of 30 
years, Lenora Sorola-Pohlman; his two chil-
dren, Jason Pohlman and Robbin Pohlman; 
his four grandchildren, Greg, Austen, Wren, 
and Jonathan; and his two great-grandchildren 
Kathrine and Max. 
For 49 years, Sgt. Pohlman proudly served 
the great city of Houston as a peace officer 
who never once received a complaint by a cit-
izen he served. Sgt. Pohlman cared deeply 
about education; he earned both his Bach-
elor’s and Master’s Degrees in Criminal Jus-
tice from the University of Houston-Downtown. 
Sgt. Pohlman joined the Houston Police De-
partment (HPD) in January 1968 and was as-
signed to the Radio Patrol Division. While in 
Radio Patrol, he worked as a criminal investi-
gator taking crime scene photos and finger-
prints. He was then promoted to Sergeant and 
assigned to the Narcotics Division in 1975. 
Eventually, he was placed in charge of inves-
tigating that division’s internal complaints until 
his retirement in 2017. 
Throughout his remarkable career in law en-
forcement, Sgt. Pohlman was truly a re-
spected and recognized leader. He was the 
first Uniform Tactical Unit officer to serve as 
both a patrolman and a Sergeant; the first 
Narcotics Division Survival School Firearms 
Instructor; the first supervisor of the Narcotics 
High Risk Arrest Team; and a supervisor in 
the first combined U.S. Customs, IRS and 
HPD Money Laundering Initiative. 
Even on his death bed, Sgt. Pohlman con-
tinued to exercise his civic duty. His dying 
wish was to vote one last time, and in his final 
moments before departing this world he asked 
his wife to bring his mail-in ballot to his hos-
pital bed and insisted on completing it in time 
for the 2020 election. He then had his wife 
take a photo of his completed ballot hoping to 
inspire others to fulfill their democratic duty 
and vote. Moments after casting his final bal-
lot, Sgt. Pohlman passed away. 
I am honored to recognize the legacy of 
Sgt. Pohlman, a true American hero, and his 
nearly five decades of service to the city of 
Houston and to this great nation.

less Americans, and I wish her the best in her

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LESLIE ‘‘LES’’ OUTERBRIDGE 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life and legacy of Leslie ‘‘Les’’ 
Outerbridge, a man who lead a life of selfless 
bravery and held a keen devotion to justice. 
Born in 1936, Les Outerbridge was raised in 
Chicago’s Cabrini—Green Homes and initially 
attended Wells Community Academy High 
School at the age of 12, later leaving high 
school in 1953 at the age of 15 and volun-
teering to serve his country in the United 
States Air Force. An avid athlete as a young 
man, Outerbridge played three sports, football, 
basketball, and baseball on his Air Force in-
stallation. Later in his life, Outerbridge would 
return to school, receiving a Bachelor’s in 
Science from Chicago State University in 
1981. 
Feeling that he still had more to give to his 
community and country after serving in the 
armed forces, Outerbridge joined the Chicago 
Fire Department in 1961. While dutifully and 
bravely serving his community, Outerbridge 
was not afraid to simultaneously fight the fires 
of injustice within the fire department. For 
much of the 1960s and 1970s, the percentage 
of minorities serving in the fire department 
was under five percent. Furthermore, when Af-
rican-American or Hispanic firefighters were 
given the opportunity to put their lives on the 
line for their fellow Chicagoans, they found 
themselves stifled by a systemically racist de-
partment that made promotion unattainable. 
Unable to stand by and watch this injustice 
pervade the department he was a part of, 
Outerbridge sprang into action. Working with 
key community leaders and activists including 
Father George Clements and Kermit Coleman, 
an attorney, and civil rights organizations in-
cluding Operation PUSH and the Urban 
League, Outerbridge set out to end the unfair 
treatment of African-Americans in the Chicago 
Fire Department. Along with his fellow fire-
fighters Jim Winbush and Wesley Thompson, 
Outerbridge founded the Afro American Fire-
fighters League (AAFL). 
Madam Speaker, it is difficult to understate 
the positive impact of the Afro American Fire-
fighters league on the Chicago Fire Depart-
ment. Outerbridge and the AAFL worked dili-
gently to document the racial discrimination 
they found within the Department, and their 
work would lead to the United States Depart-
ment of Justice filing suit against the City of 
Chicago, resulting in a consent decree that 
mandated the Department increase its total 
number of African-American firefighters from 
125 to at least 400. 
While work remains to be done to build a 
Chicago Fire Department that is reflective of 
the city it serves, the legacy of Outerbridge’s 
work continues. In 2011, a lawsuit brought by 
African-American Chicago firefighters made it 
all the way to the Supreme Court of the United 
States, which ruled that over 6,000 African- 
American applicants for positions within the 
Chicago Fire Department could pursue a dis-
parate impact claim against the city. The Su-
preme Court’s ruling helped pave the way to 
a settlement that allowed almost a thousand 
applicants to reapply, and the possibility of 
monetary reward as compensation for the dis-
crimination they faced. From the Cabrini- 
Green Homes to the Supreme Court—that is 
how far the lasting and enduring legacy of Les 
Outerbridge stretches. 
In 2002, Outerbridge would author and pub-
lish a book detailing his life’s remarkable jour-
ney titled ‘‘Memoirs of a Black Fire Fighter: 
Les Outerbridge, 1961–1995’’. Those close to 
him Outerbridge will remember him as pas-
sionate historian and an avid photographer. 
My best wishes and prayers are with the 
Outerbridge family and all those who had the 
distinct privilege of knowing Leslie Outerbridge 
during his remarkable life.

HONORING GREATER MT. OLIVET 
MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
church, Greater Mt. Olivet Missionary Baptist 
Church. 
On November 28, 1945, Rev. A.C. Alex-
ander and a small group of people met at the 
home of Mr. and Mrs. George Whitley at 227 
South Sixth Street in Greenville, Mississippi, to 
organize a church. Their first meeting was 
held on the third Sunday in December at the 
Greenville Industrial College located at 240 
South Eight Street. Meetings were held each 
third Sunday until 1947, when the group 
moved to a wooden structure building at 239 
North Seventh Street. The church was orga-
nized with eight members. However, the 
church membership did increase, and Rev. 
Alexander served as Pastor the years of 
1945–1954. Then, Rev. Albert Johnson served 
as Pastor the years of 1954 to 1957. 
From 1957–1976, Rev. H.A. Armstrong 
served as a Pastor. He surveyed the needs of 
the church and those needs were Christian 
commitment to the church, furniture for the 
church, and a renewed hope in Christ. Rev. 
Armstrong’s first sermon title was taken from 
Nehemiah 4:6, ‘‘For the people has a mind to 
work.’’ During Rev. Armstrong’s tenure, Mt. 
Olivet built their 2nd Church building in 1972. 
Dr. Hudson Augustus became the full-time 
Pastor of Mt. Olivet Missionary Baptist Church. 
During Dr. Augustus tenure, the 2nd Church 
building was paid in full. Dr. Augustus was a 
faithful shepherd of this church until his death 
on April 9, 2003. 
Currently, Dr. Lee E. Morris, Jr., is the Pas-
tor, and has been serving since 2004. Under 
the leadership of Dr. Morris, the church has 
attracted many new members and new min-
istries and a name change to Greater Mt. Oli-
vet Missionary Baptist Church. Under Dr. Mor-
ris leadership, Greater Mt. Olivet built their 3rd 
church building, which includes a new sanc-
tuary, an educational annex (9 classrooms), 
recreational complex (gym), and a pastoral 
parsonage. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Greater Mt. Olivet Mis-
sionary Baptist Church for its longevity and 
dedication to serving others.

IN MEMORY OF EARL ‘‘JIM’’ 
LINEBAUGH 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
an outstanding Pennsylvanian, Mr. Earl E. 
‘‘Jim’’ Linebaugh. A member of the Greatest 
Generation, Mr. Linebaugh served in the U.S. 
Navy during World War II. A lifelong resident 
of Adams County, he was an incredible mem-
ber of our community throughout his life. 
Mr. Linebaugh was born on September 23, 
1922, in Washington Township, the son of the 
late Amos and Lucy L. (Stine) Linebaugh. 
In 1944, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Fol-
lowing his service, Mr. Linebaugh was em-
ployed with East Berlin Feed Mills for many 
years before retiring from Sprenkle Feed Mills 
in York. 
He 
was 
the 
husband 
to 
Mildred 
E. 
(McManus) Linebaugh, who died in 1986, and 
the late wife Loretta (Crook) Linebaugh. Mr. 
Linebaugh had ten children and numerous 
grandchildren, whom he adored. In addition to 
his work and life with his family, Mr. 
Linebaugh also was an active member of St. 
John’s Lutheran Church in Abbottstown and a 
robust member of the Adams County commu-
nity. 
When he passed away on Thursday, June 
4, 2020, at 97, Mr. Linebaugh left an indelible 
impression on both our community and our 
nation. On behalf of the 13th Congressional 
District of Pennsylvania, it is my privilege to 
honor the life and service of Earl ‘‘Jim’’ 
Linebaugh. I offer my deepest sympathies to

HONORING MIKE BARBOUR OF THE 
VETERANS FOR FOREIGN WARS 
AND 
THE 
AMERICAN 
LEGION 
POST 43 UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mike Barbour, who is retiring from his 
position as the Service Officer for Veterans for 
Foreign Wars and the American Legion Post 
43. With a long and illustrious career serving 
our country in Vietnam and advocating for vet-
erans in Naperville and Aurora, Mike has dis-
tinguished himself as a valuable and dedi-
cated member of the community. 
Mike served with the U.S. Army Special 
Forces in Vietnam. Since 1994, he has de-
voted his time to educating veterans and their 
families about benefits and health care they 
can receive from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA). As an honorary board member 
for Naperville Responds for Veterans, Mike 
has served as an important resource for vet-
erans by helping to share their stories to the 
younger generation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mike Barbour’s exemplary 
service to the veterans of Naperville and Au-
rora and congratulating him on a prominent 
career.

CONGRATULATING BRIAN MIXON 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Brian Mixon on his 
retirement after 4 years of active duty and 32 
years of civilian service with the Department of 
the Army. 
Brian served honorably as an air traffic and 
airspace officer, and was recognized for his 
work when he was awarded the Air Traffic 
Control Manager of the Year award by the Air 
Traffic Control Association in 2019. This na-
tional award is formally known as the General 
E.R. Quesada Memorial Award, and it’s a me-
dallion award presented to an individual for 
outstanding achievement and contribution dur-
ing the previous year as an Air Traffic Control 
Manager. 
This is not the first time Brian has been rec-
ognized for his exceptional work. He also 
earned two other national awards, among 
many others. 
Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia’s First Con-
gressional District is one of the premier power 
projection platforms in the Army, which is uti-
lized to deploy thousands of soldiers and es-
sential equipment. Brian’s contributions have 
been essential to the readiness capabilities of 
the units that utilize Hunter Army Airfield. I 
can’t thank him enough for his many years of 
steadfast dedication to serving our great na-
tion, and I wish Brian the best as he begins 
his retirement.

Emmanuel Lutheran Church was founded in 
Dearborn, Michigan in 1895 with Christian 
Thiel, Gottfried Hebestreit, and Louis Rechlin 
Sr. acting as the first trustees and Johann 
Lange, Wilhelm Ziegler, and Fredrich Syl-
vester servings as elders. A year later, Henry 
Behrens became the church’s first pastor, and 
the church celebrated the opening of its newly 
erected sanctuary at Military and Morley Ave-

member of the Missouri Synod, and the parish 
founded Emmanuel Lutheran School in 1945, 
with Mr. Al Wied as the first teacher. In 1960, 
Emmanuel Lutheran Church dedicated her 
new sanctuary across from the original sanc-
tuary, where the parish continues to flourish 
today. 
Today, Emmanuel Lutheran Church is led 
by administrative pastor Reverend Joel Basely 
and assistant pastor Reverend Paul Wolff who 
encourage all to life of faith, love, under-
standing, and trust, and Paul Berwolf serves 
as principal and teacher of Emmanuel Lu-
theran School. Emmanuel Lutheran Church 
has made a meaningful difference in the com-
munity by providing a breadth of programs 
and services for the benefit of all. Notably, the 
parish has developed a partnership with the 
St. Martin Lutheran School for the Deaf, which 
has been integrated with the parish school to 
provide a bilingual education to students and 
faculty. 
Over the course of 125 years, Emmanuel 
Lutheran Church has become a pillar of the 
Dearborn community. The parish has dem-
onstrated a true commitment to serving Dear-
born and encouraging all to be passionate, de-
voted, and kind community members who 
strive to follow the Word of God. Emmanuel 
Lutheran Church continues to be a welcoming 
place for all to gather, worship, and develop 
the gifts God has bestowed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the 125th anniversary of Em-
manuel Lutheran Church. We are all grateful 
for its service to the Dearborn community and 
wish it continued success and prosperity in the 
years to come.

REMARKS ON THE POSITIVE DE-
VELOPMENTS 
IN 
THE 
UNION 
TERRITORY 
OF 
JAMMU 
AND 
KASHMIR 
HON. A. DREW FERGUSON IV 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I re-
cently had the opportunity to meet with India’s 
Consulate General Dr. Swati V. Kulkarni to 
discuss the bilateral relationship between India 
and the United States, and I rise today to rec-
ognize the critical importance of this relation-
ship with our ally, India. 
In any part of the world, Madam Speaker, 
individuals and families need to feel safe when 
they leave their homes and go to work. Ter-
rorist groups need to be strongly opposed in 
all forms. Without question, India is a strong 
partner in the fight against international ter-
rorism. As a part of this pursuit, the Indian 
Government recently repealed Article 370—a 
temporary Article of the Indian Constitution 
that forced citizens of Jammu-Kashmir to live 
under different laws than all other Indians. It 
was meant to be a stopgap measure since 
this region’s government had yet to be formed. 
Madam Speaker, this measure hindered the 
application of progressive federal laws of the 
Indian Government. As a result, Pakistani- 
based terrorist organizations conducted ter-
rorist activities that accounted for thousands of 
innocent lives being lost and detrimentally im-
pacted economic opportunities in the region. 
In August of 2019, both Houses of the Indian 
parliament voted to end the temporary status 
of Article 370 in order to bring peace, stability, 
and the opportunity to chart out better futures 
to the people of the region. 
I applaud the current steps taken by Prime 
Minister Modi to boost economic development, 
fight terrorism, and fight corruption. These 
steps forward are good for the long-term sta-
bility of Jammu-Kashmir and we should sup-
port the Indian Government in this endeavor.

RECOGNIZING 
LARRY 
VIGNOLA 
AND HIS SERVICE TO THE CITY 
OF CORAL SPRINGS 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor Larry Vignola for his 10 years of 
service to the City of Coral Springs, Florida, 
Larry moved to Coral Springs when he was 5 
years old, where he received a public-school 
education, attending Coral Springs Elementary 
and Middle Schools, and Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School. 
After graduating from the University of 
Miami, Larry decided to give back to the com-
munity where he grew up and was first elected 
to serve as City Commissioner in 2010, Larry 
also acted as Coral Springs Vice Mayor for 
two years, and is Chair of several key commit-
tees, including the Youth and Family Com-
mittee, the Principal Education Committee and 
the Teen Political Forum, where I have been 
a regular guest speaker, and have seen 
Larry’s commitment to our future leaders first-
hand. 
As an alumni and City Commissioner Larry 
has always been there for the students, teach-
ers and administrators of MSD before and 
after the tragedy in 2018. Through this dedica-
tion to public service, there is no doubt that 
Larry has made a significant positive impact 
on the Coral Springs community. 
As an avid sports fan, Larry has also de-
voted much of his life to coaching and men-
toring young athletes, serving on the Coral 
Springs American Little League Board of Di-
rectors and chairing the Coral Springs Sports 
Coalition. He is a proud family man and en-
joys spending his free time with his wife 
Aimee and their three children, Madison, Ava 
and Aimee. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Larry Vignola and his serv-
ice to Coral Springs and Florida’s 22nd Con-
gressional District.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE INTER-
NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION 
OF 
DRILLING 
CONTRACTORS 
80TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend the International Association of 
Drilling Contractors on its 80th anniversary as 
a trade association. 
In 1940, the International Association of 
Drilling Contractors, commonly known as 
IADC, was formed to address the need for a 
collective voice advocating for the interests of 
the oil and natural gas contract drilling indus-
try. Since then, IADC has been the world’s 
leader in developing drilling safety protocol 
and standard operating procedures. 
Today, IADC continues to exemplify the 
ideal model of leadership and remains com-
mitted to teaching the core values of safety, 
environmental stewardship, and continuous 
improvement of technology to generation after 
generation of America’s energy workforce. 
Over the years, IADC has maintained 1,000 
plus members worldwide, seventeen regional 
chapters, seven student chapters, and has ac-
credited the training of nearly 2 million per-
sons employed in the oil and gas industry, 
many of which have been hardworking Wyo-
mingites. With six member companies oper-
ating in-state, IADC plays a critical role in the 
exploration and production of Wyoming’s vast

Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my 
gratitude to the International Association of 
Drilling Contractors for eighty years of unwav-
ering competence, professionalism, and com-
mitment in support of the transformational drill-
ing industry that sustains the energy intensive 
demands of our modern society.

HONORING KRISTOPHER THIGPEN 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Mr. Kristopher Thigpen, a na-
tive of Taylorsville, Mississippi. Football and 
athletics have always been a very important 
part of his life growing up. After having a stel-
lar career in high school, he signed with Jack-
son State University and was a member of the 
football team. He then transferred and played 
at Jones College. He graduated from the Uni-
versity of Southern Mississippi with a Bach-
elor’s degree. 
He has served as a middle and high school 
coach with stops in North Forest High School, 
Collins High School and Carver Middle 
School, Coffeeville High School and Ridgeland 
High School before going to Terry High School 
last year as offensive coordinator. Over the 
course of ten years as an educator and a 
coach, he has helped 33 football players re-
ceive college scholarships, was Head Coach 
of the Year at Ridgeland High School in 2019, 
and won a total of four state championships 
as a player and a coach. 
He resides in Byram, Mississippi, with his 
wife, Mrs. Michele Thigpen, and has three 
children: Jekhyla, Krishon, and Kasen. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Kristopher Thigpen.

Sesquicentennial, 
or 
150th 
anniversary. 
Founded October 24, 1870, Jesup is a special 
place that started as a humble railroad town. 
Although there isn’t a definitive historical docu-
ment, it’s long been debated what Jesup was 
named after. In honor of Jesup’s 150th anni-
versary, a trial was recently held by Wayne 
County High School to determine who founded 
Jesup. 
It was Jesup’s first mayor, Willis Clary, who 
was influential in the growth of the town in its 
early years since he urged that the Macon & 
Brunswick railroad crossed the Savannah & 
Gulf line at Jesup in 1871. Movie stars and 
presidential 
candidates 
frequently 
visited 
Jesup to promote their movies and campaign 
from the back of the trains. 
The long-seated history of Jesup helped 
make it the thriving city it is today. 
I am thankful for the work of Jesup’s current 
mayor, David Earl Keith, who works whole-
heartedly for the people of Jesup every day.

HONORING 
ALAN 
TURING 
AS 
A 
DISTINGUISHED 
MATHEMATI-
CIAN AND HERO 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Alan Turing 
was a brilliant English mathematician, founder 
of modern computer science and a World War 
II hero. 
His contributions during the war, especially 
his work alongside others in cryptography, 
were hailed as ‘‘priceless’’ by our own Presi-
dent Eisenhower. By breaking German mili-
tary-codes, Turing helped to quickly win the 
Battle of the Atlantic, without which the Allies 
may not have been able to launch D-Day in 
1944. His efforts helped to shorten the war, 
possibly by years, saving incalculable human 
life. 
Even today, our lives are impacted by his 
work. Turing is credited with creating the mod-
ern computer concept and helping to found 
computer science by theorizing a program-
mable machine capable of computing anything 
computable. 
Yet Turing was more than just a mathemati-
cian, an inventor or a hero. Turing was a gay 
man. Because he was gay, he faced persecu-
tion for merely being who he was. In 1952, 
just seven years after he had helped defeat 
the Nazis, he was prosecuted for being in a 
gay relationship and forced to undergo chem-
ical castration to avoid prison. 
Two years later, in 1954, he died, possibly 
by suicide. He was only 41. 
Turing’s life is a reminder of how brilliant 
anyone could be, no matter what the world 
perceived them or of whom they loved. His life 
also serves as a reminder of the harm and 
costs that accompany discrimination and prej-
udice. We will never know what else Alan 
Turing might have discovered had he been ac-
cepted, and what he might have accomplished 
had his life not been cut so short. We do know 
that the world owes him a great deal of grati-
tude, and for that, we honor him for LGBTQ 
History Month. 
IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF 
SID 
HARTMAN, MINNESOTA SPORTS 
COLUMNIST AND BROADCASTER, 
FOUNDER OF THE MINNEAPOLIS 
LAKERS, DEALMAKER, FAN, FA-
THER, 
GRANDFATHER, 
AND 
FRIEND 
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, it is with 
profound sadness and great affection that I 
rise today to celebrate the extraordinary life of 
Sid Hartman, a Minnesota sports pioneer and 
giant in journalism who passed away last 
week at the age of 100. 
A child of Jewish immigrant parents who 
grew up in North Minneapolis in the 1920s, 
Sid sold newspapers on downtown street cor-
ners—unwittingly beginning what would be-
come a 75-year career in the news business. 
His first column in the Star Tribune was pub-
lished on September 11, 1945—just days after 
the end of WWII—and by the time he pub-
lished his last column for the Minneapolis Star 
Tribune on October 18, 2020, his total number 
of bylines reached 21,235. 
I was first introduced to Sid by my great- 
grandfather at a Vikings game at the old Met 
Stadium in the mid 1970s. I was a star-struck 
kid, meeting sports royalty that rivaled my 
idols, Fran Tarkenton, Chuck Foreman, and 
Alan Page. And from the time I could read, 
Sid’s column was a staple of my mornings for 
my entire life. 
Sid Hartman had the audacity to dream big. 
As an entrepreneurial young journalist, he 
helped bring the Detroit Gems to Minneapolis 
in 1947, where they became the Minneapolis 
Lakers and established a National Basketball 
Association championship dynasty—winning 
five titles in six years with such greats as 
George Mikan, Elgin Baylor, and future Vi-
kings head coach, Bud Grant. 
A superfan of all things Minnesota, Sid was 
our sports documentarian and historian, and 
saw teams, arenas and stadiums come and 
go over 75 years. He covered the Millers, the 
Twins, the North Stars, the Wild, the Vikings, 
the Lakers, the Timberwolves, and his beloved 
Minnesota Gophers. He taught us to love 
sports and sports personalities and reported 
with fairness and fortitude. Between the 
games, news conferences, and award cere-
monies for Minnesota’s sports teams, Sid was 
always easy to spot with his old black tape re-
corder and address book overflowing with 
numbers for his thousands of ‘‘close, personal 
friends.’’ 
Defying his age and ever adapting to new 
sports, new teams, and new technologies, he 
kept up his writing pace even after his 100th 
birthday. In a column celebrating his milestone 
birthday, he said, ‘‘I have followed the advice 
that if you love what you do, you never work 
a day in your life. Even at 100 I can say I still 
love what I do.’’ What a lesson for all of us. 
Sid was a loving father and grandfather. His 
son, Chad Hartman, followed him into the 
world of sports, and they served alongside 
each other at WCCO–AM radio for years. 
Friends, family and community meant the 
world to him, and his integrity and fairness 
opened doors and generated scoops that few 
could rival. 
Sid’s contributions to the sports culture of 
Minnesota are unmatched and indelible. He 
made the Twin Cities big league towns, and 
touched countless lives along the way. It was 
an honor and privilege to know him and to de-
vour his column every morning for decades. 
Perhaps from heaven he can help the Vikings 
win the elusive Super Bowl he was never able 
to celebrate over the course of 60 seasons. 
Minnesota and I will miss Sid Hartman, and 
our entire delegation joins me in sharing our 
heartfelt condolences with Sid’s family, loved 
ones, fellow sports journalists, and friends.

CONGRESSIONAL RECOGNITION OF 
MONICA KATRICE ROBERTS 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to ask for posthumous Congres-
sional Recognition for Monica Katrice Roberts, 
a self-proclaimed proud, unapologetic Black 
transgender woman who spoke truth to power 
and told the often-neglected stories of the 
world around her. Monica Katrice Roberts was 
born on May 4, 1962, in Houston, Texas, to 
Mable and Rick Roberts; she is survived by 
her mother, one brother, two sisters, and a 
host of brothers, sisters, and gender noncon-
forming loved ones in the movement she cou-
rageously committed herself to. 
Monica Katrice Roberts began her career as 
a writer and unwavering transgender activist, 
launching the TransGriot in 2006 and commit-
ting herself to her life’s calling as a storyteller 
for transgender persons who often had no 
voice in media. Monica Katrice Roberts was 
especially committed to accurately capturing 
the stories of Black transgender women who 
are disproportionately brutalized and violently 
killed 
and 
are 
overlooked 
or 
often 
misgendered by mainstream media. Monica 
Katrice Roberts received many awards for her 
noteworthy journalism—as Founding Man-
aging Editor of TransGriot and her work with 
the Bilerico Project, Ebony, Huffington Post, 
and The Advocate—as well as her extraor-
dinary activism, including the Virginia Prince 
Transgender Pioneer Award, the Robert Coles 
Call of Service Award, the Barbara Jordan 
Breaking Barriers Award, and the 2020 Susan 
J. Hyde Award for Longevity in the Movement. 
Monica Katrice Roberts will be greatly 
missed for her fierce leadership, unapologetic 
demeanor, storytelling, activism, and unwaver-
ing commitment to the transgender commu-
nity. It is my honor to commemorate her life 
and legacy before this legislative body.

OVERDUE RECOGNITION OF VALOR 
FOR VETERAN RENE TALBOTT 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
call attention to bravery that has gone unrec-
ognized until now. Sergeant Rene Talbott 
served honorably in the United States Air 
Force from November 2, 1967 to November 1,

1973, including two tours of duty in Vietnam. 
In 2018, Mr. Talbott requested his service 
records from the National Archive and discov-
ered in an evaluation from 1968 that his supe-
rior officer had recommended him for a 
Bronze Star Medal. No further action was 
taken at the time, and Sgt. Talbott was not in-
formed. Upon discovering the recommenda-
tion, former Sgt. Talbott, now in his 80s, took 
immediate action and applied to have his serv-
ice record changed to reflect the Medal. Unfor-
tunately, the passage of over half a century 
between then and now means that Airmen 
and others who witnessed his actions and who 
could provide evidence of his valor have all 
died. His request to have his record amended 
was denied. Though he has appealed, the 
likelihood of a change is very small. 
Nonetheless, Rene Talbott deserves to have 
his actions acknowledged. With this entry into 
the official proceedings of the Congress of the 
United States, I call attention to the strength 
and courage he displayed during his active 
duty service with this excerpt from Airman 
Talbott’s evaluation: 
During his training, he showed an out-
standing ability to learn and to retain what he 
learned. This was demonstrated on 30 May 
1968, when as assistant machine gunner dur-
ing a fire fight with an enemy of unknown 
strength and size, he reacted in a professional 
manner. He assisted the machine gunner in 
spotting targets and directing his fire. His self- 
control under fire showed his good discipline 
and outstanding ability to react under adverse 
conditions. For his action in this incident Air-
man Talbott was recommended for the Bronze 
Star. 
While I still hope that Mr. Talbott will suc-
ceed in having his service record reflect the 
awarding of the Bronze Star, with this entry 
into the official record of the Proceedings of 
the U.S. Congress, I call attention to his dedi-
cation, his courage, and his integrity. The he-
roic actions that originally inspired Airman 
Talbott’s chain of command to recommend 
him for the Bronze Star are now on full display 
for public recognition.

HONORING DRAKE’S BBQ 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
establishment, Drake’s BBQ. 
It all started with one man and a vision. Mr. 
Kendrell Drake always loved cooking and grill-
ing. His wife, Mrs. Shulundia Drake, recalls, 
‘‘We would always have cookouts at our 
house every weekend and invite friends and 
family over.’’ One day, Mr. Drake said, ‘‘I won-
der would my friends buy my barbecue if I 
started selling it.’’ Mrs. Drake remembers say-
ing to him, ‘‘Sure they would.’’ 
About a year later, they began their bar-
becue journey. It started with their family; Mr. 
& Mrs. Drake and their three daughters; 
Sekayi, Khamya and Kendall. It was late sum-
mer 2014 when they started selling barbecue 
from a trailer Mr. Drake built. Mrs. Drake was 
right by his side on those hot days, standing 
next to a big grill waiting and serving cus-
tomers. 
They were both employed full time at the 
time of their venture. He was employed with 
Frito Lay and she was employed with Green-
wood Leflore Hospital. On his off days, which 
were Wednesdays and Saturdays, he would 
pull the trailer on the side of Highway 82 and 
wait on customers to arrive. By the time Mrs. 
Drake would arrive, around 11:15, they would 
have a line of customers. 
They worked in the heat, rain, and freezing 
cold weather. And you wouldn’t believe how 
people would come out in that type of weather 
for Drake’s barbecue. That made them realize 
that a physical location was needed. 
Four years later, they are now located in-
side the Village Shopping Center at 1904 A 
Leflore Avenue in Greenwood, Mississippi. 
They’ve been at this location for about four 
years now. They have been nominated as one 
of the Top 10 Places to Work, Top 30 under 
40 by the Greenwood Chamber of Commerce 
and received the Greenwood Commonwealth 
People’s Choice Best Barbecue Award 3 
years in a row since 2018. 
The Drake’s credit to their success to the 
loyalty of their customers. Every year in Sep-
tember, Drake’s BBQ holds a customer appre-
ciation day. They give away around 400 to 
500 plates to the customers to show how 
much they appreciate their continuous sup-
port. ‘‘After all, they’re the ones who keep us 
going,’’ states Mrs. Drake. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Drake’s BBQ for their service 
and commitment to the community.

SALUTING COAST GUARD SECTOR 
ST. PETERSBURG 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to express my gratitude to the brave men and 
women of the United States Coast Guard sta-
tioned at Coast Guard Sector Saint Peters-
burg, and all the units within Pinellas County. 
They consistently perform with honor, respect, 
and devotion to duty throughout Florida, our 
nation, and among our international maritime 
community; even in times of crisis, uncertainty, 
and emerging threats. 
Between fiscal years 2019 and 2020 alone, 
Sector St. Petersburg ran over 1400 Search 
and Rescue cases, the third highest across 
the nation. More importantly, they saved 320 
and assisted 1858 lives. In addition, they 
helped keep our waterways beautiful and 
clean by conducting 726 Marine Environ-
mental Protection cases. To keep the Marine 
Transportation System moving safely and effi-
ciently, often described as the lifeblood or our 
economy, with $5.4 trillion in annual impact, 
they expertly conducted 294 Marine Safety 
cases. And, among the many other accom-
plishments, Sector St. Pete helped maintain 
our security by leading 173 Security missions, 
and 761 Law enforcement missions. 
If that body of work was not impressive 
enough, I am particularly proud of how they’ve 
managed to step up to the plate in the face of 
adversity. From our ongoing fight against the 
COVID–19 pandemic, increasing frequency 
and severity of natural disasters and hurri-
canes, or an uncertain budgetary environ-
ment—they continue to live up to their motto 
of ‘‘Semper Paratus’’—Always Ready.

CELEBRATING 
NORTHERN 
ILLI-
NOIS UNIVERSITY’S 125TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today for myself and Members of the Illi-
nois delegation to speak about Northern Illi-
nois University, my alma mater and a major 
contributor to the life, health and future of the 
Midwest and beyond. 
This year, NIU celebrates its 125th anniver-
sary. Like so many state universities across 
our great country, NIU began as a ‘‘normal 
school,’’ or teachers college. In the late 1800s, 
11 million people had moved from farms to cit-
ies, and our country had welcomed 25 million 
new immigrants. The need for better access to 
education was exceeded only by the need for 
more teachers—and schools like NIU were 
created to meet those needs. 
From the beginning, NIU has been an insti-
tution committed to providing opportunity for 
underserved students—students who are the 
first in their families to attend college, students 
of color and students with high financial need. 
Today nearly 75 percent of NIU students fall 
into one or more of those categories, with 
about 45 percent Pell grant-eligible, 50 per-
cent students of color and 50 percent first 
generation college students. At the same time, 
NIU excels in the creation and dissemination 
of new knowledge. In 2017, the Brookings In-
stitution gave NIU high rankings for excellence 
at the intersection of research accomplish-
ments and the creation of social mobility for 
students exposed to hands-on research and 
other opportunities they might not otherwise 
experience. 
NIU faculty are not only great teachers, but 
many are world-renowned scientists, authors, 
and 
policy 
experts. 
They 
study 
climate 
change, look for ways to improve physical and 
mental health, create fuel-saving vehicles, ex-
pand the boundaries of visual and perform-
ance art, explore ancient and modern cultures 
and much more. A host of federal agencies 
have expressed confidence in NIU through 
grant awards for study of such diverse areas 
as Southeast Asian languages and cultures, 
assistive technologies for people who are blind 
or visually impaired, and new devices for the 
Department of Homeland Security to keep air 
travel safe. 
Nearly 250,000 alumni in the northern Illi-
nois region and around the world are making 
a difference in their chosen fields. The impact 
of this outstanding institution has earned the 
respect and attention of a grateful state and 
nation. As a proud alumna, I am honored to 
join my colleagues to congratulate Northern Il-
linois University on this, its 125th anniversary.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 97TH 
TURKISH INDEPENDENCE DAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Turkish-American Cul-
tural Association of Michigan on the celebra-
tion of the 97th Turkish Independence Day on 
October 29, 2020. 
The Turkish-American Cultural Association 
is a valued member of Michigan. The group 
serves as a bridge that unifies our commu-
nities to promote, plan, and execute programs 
that improve humanitarian and cultural welfare 
of the Turkish community in Michigan and 
abroad. The organization has been a strong 
voice for the Turkish people, and its efforts 
have been paramount in fostering a meaning-
ful relationship between Turkey and the United 
States. Its leadership has made a true dif-
ference in Michigan and in communities 
across the nation. 
As we celebrate the 97th Turkish Independ-
ence Day, I am proud to recognize the many 
Americans of Turkish descent who have con-
tributed significantly to our state, especially 
Michigan’s 12th Congressional District. Turk-
ish-Americans enrich our communities and 
continue to demonstrate a steadfast commit-
ment to making Michigan a more inclusive, vi-
brant, and prosperous place for all. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the 97th Turkish Independence 
Day. We thank the Turkish-American Cultural 
Association for its commitment to Michigan 
and look forward to celebrating this special an-
niversary for many years to come.

TRIBUTE TO RETIRED BRIGADIER 
GENERAL 
FRANK 
TONEY, 
JR., 
UNITED STATES ARMY SPECIAL 
FORCES 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the life of Retired Brigadier 
General Frank Toney, Jr., United States Army 
Special Forces, who passed away on August 
6, 2020, at the age of 70. 
Frank Toney was born in Tampa, Florida, 
on March 1, 1950, where he was raised until 
he graduated from Henry B. Plant High School 
in 1968. He attended Arkansas State Univer-
sity on an athletic scholarship and was a part 
of Arkansas State’s championship football 
team that went undefeated in 1970. He grad-
uated in 1972 as a Distinguished Military 
Graduate with the Red Wolf Battalion ROTC 
program and received an active duty commis-
sion as an infantry officer with the United 
States Army. 
As a Lieutenant, Toney served with the 7th 
Psychological Operations Group, 1st Special 
Forces Group, and the 51st Infantry Regiment. 
After graduating the Advanced Infantry Officer 
Course, Captain Toney assumed his first com-
pany command with the highly esteemed 2nd 
Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment at Fort 
Lewis, Washington. Following this command, 
Toney became a Special Forces officer after 
earning his green beret. Toney was then pro-
moted to Major in 1981 and served four years 
with the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort 
Bragg, North Carolina. He graduated from the 
Command and General Staff College in 1986 
and was assigned to the John F. Kennedy 
Special Warfare Center and School where his 
incredible leadership shaped the intensive 
Special Forces Assessment and Selection 
Course responsible for evaluating and select-
ing the best candidates to attend the Special 
Forces Qualification Course. 
Toney was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel 
in 1989, and his leadership would shape spe-
cial operations in the Middle East and Africa 
throughout the 1990s. He led 1st Battalion, 
3rd Special Forces Group in combat during 
Operation Desert Storm. He was promoted to 
Colonel after attending the National War Col-
lege and commanded the 10th Special Forces 
Group between 1992 and 1994. Toney then 
served as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations 
and then as Deputy Commander of Anny Spe-
cial Operations Command before he was pro-
moted to Brigadier General and commanded 
all Special Operations Forces under Special 
Operations Command Central during Oper-
ation Desert Fox. 
Toney is best known as the Commander of 
the United States Special Forces Command 
during the initial push into Afghanistan where 
he radically shifted the Special Forces mission 
towards unconventional warfare to effectively 
fight the Taliban. Under his command, Special 
Forces were able to rally together and lead 
the Northern Alliance of tribes to liberate Af-
ghanistan from the Taliban. 
Toney retired from the United States Army 
in January 2002, but even in retirement he 
continued to serve as an advisor upholding 
United States interests throughout Africa and 
the Middle East. In fact, in February 2012, the 
United States Army Special Forces Regiment 
recognized Toney as a Distinguished Member 
in the Regimental Honors, Awards, and Affili-
ation Program. This was an honor that had 
been given to less than 80 men before him. 
Even after he retired to Medford, Oregon, 
he continued to serve his country and the mili-
tary he loved. Over the last decade, Toney as-
sisted me in the assessment and rec-
ommendations of the best potential candidates 
for our nation’s military service academies. His 
pointed and expert guidance in his role as 
Chairman for my annual Service Academy 
Nomination Boards was invaluable. He will be 
missed. 
Toney is survived by his wife Sally and his 
son, Frank Toney, also a United States Army 
Veteran. Toney’s decorations and awards in-
clude the Defense Distinguished Service 
Medal, the Distinguished Service Medal, the 
Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Master 
and Military Free Fall Parachute Badges, 
among other distinguished awards. Overall, 
Toney dedicated more than 40 years of serv-
ice to our country.

October 30, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me and Toney’s family in honoring the life and 
service of Brigadier General Frank Toney, Jr. 
For a man of his caliber, who demonstrated 
superb leadership, dedication, and sacrifice 
throughout his service to our great nation, it 
seems no amount of recognition is sufficient to 
say thank you but he will always be remem-
bered as a highly respected leader and war-
rior.

RECOGNIZING THE 97TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PROCLAMATION 
OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the gov-
ernment and people of the Republic of Turkey 
on the 97th anniversary of October 29, 1923, 
when Turkey became a Republic. 
It was on this day in 1923 when Mustafa 
Kemal Ataturk, the visionary leader of modern 
Turkey, became its first President. Under his 
leadership, Turkey rose from the ashes of a 
war-torn country into a confident, stable, and 
growing democracy. 
Turkey and the United States have been 
NATO Allies since 1952. Our soldiers have 
been serving side by side for almost seven 
decades in crises and conflicts in a vast geog-
raphy, ranging from Afghanistan to Kosovo. 
Turkey is an important ally and partner of 
the United States in facing 21st century chal-
lenges. 
According to the United Nations High Com-
missioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Turkey is 
now the largest refugee-hosting country in the 
world. 
Turkish Americans are an important part of 
the fabric of the United States, as evidenced 
by their contributions to the arts, science, aca-
demia, and business. 
Turkish Americans serve as goodwill am-
bassadors promoting greater understanding 
between the United States and Turkey, by 
educating people in the United States about 
Turkey’s rich cultural heritage, and the impor-
tance of the partnership to advance mutual in-
terests between the United States and Turkey. 
I rise today to congratulate my friends in the 
United States and Turkey on the 97th anniver-
sary of the establishment of the Republic of 
Turkey.

HONORING DEBRA SMITH WRIGHT 
AS A BELOVED EDUCATOR AND 
MENTOR 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 30, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Debra Smith 
Wright was a beloved educator and mother, 
whose legacy is the countless minds she 
opened and hearts she touched. 
Ms. Smith Wright was born in 1953, to 
Eddie Lowe Smith and Essie Mae Jackson. 
She graduated from Lakeland High School in 
1970, and Florida Memorial College in 1973. 
Afterwards, she went on to earn her master’s 
and Specialist in Education Leadership from 
Rollins College in 1984. 
Ms. Smith Wright began her long and influ-
ential career in education as an elementary 
music teacher. She went on to serve as a 
principal, and in 2007, she retired as an edu-
cation consultant. Even after her retirement, 
her dedication to the field endured, and she 
served as a Polk County School Board mem-
ber. 
Ms. Smith Wright took the time to mentor 
me on the history of Polk County Schools, the 
struggles and reforms, and improvements 
made over the years. We worked together to 
improve justice for all students regardless of 
their background, expand trade program op-
portunities for young people to help them de-
velop skills, and increase teacher pay to retain 
and recruit top talent at our schools. For this 
and more, we honor her.
