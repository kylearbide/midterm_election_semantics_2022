Reverend William Gurnee, St. Jo-
seph’s Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer: 
Eternal God, this day we come hum-

Your goodness, be present to our citi-

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section

nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. FEENSTRA led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
GET THE VACCINE 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the 
coronavirus has gotten to levels in 
Memphis not known since last Janu-
ary; 
it 
is 
dangerous. 
Fortunately, 
today, the Pfizer vaccine was given 
final full approval by the FDA for all 
people 16 and over. 
This weekend, Phil Valentine, a con-
servative 
radio 
host 
in 
Nashville, 
passed away. Also, one of the greatest 
football players in Memphis, Danton 
Barto, 50 years of age, passed away. 
Both passed because they got COVID; 
neither had the vaccine. Both said to-
ward the end of their life they wished 
they would have encouraged everyone 
to get the vaccine. 
I ask you, please get the vaccine. Let 
America continue its activities and 
culture and lifestyle as we have known 
it in the past. 
f 
NANCY PELOSI’S SPENDING SPREE 
(Mr. STEIL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
sound the alarm of BERNIE SANDERS’ 
and Speaker PELOSI’s spending spree. 
Let’s not forget that earlier this year 
Biden and Pelosi have already spent 
trillions of dollars. Speaker PELOSI has 
brought us back to Washington late in 
August, but not to address the crisis in 
Afghanistan. 
No, she brought us back to push 
through another $4.5 trillion in new 
spending. If we printed that amount of 
money in bills, it would fill 50,000 semi- 
trailers. 50,000 semi-trailers of cash, 
that is what is before us. Who is ulti-
mately going to pay for this? American 
families, American workers, American 
farmers, through higher taxes. 
And as the cost of everything from 
school supplies to food to gas continue 
to go up, all of us will feel the pain of 
this wasteful spending spree through 
higher prices. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this wasteful spend-
ing plan.

THE 
PROMISE 
AND 
POWER OF THE VOTING RIGHTS

(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and 
was given permission to address the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4348 
August 23, 2021 
serve, released a report documenting 
voter suppression following the Shelby 
decision. We detailed the ongoing on-
slaught on our freedom to vote. 
To those that claim that voting is al-
ready accessible to all, read the report, 
open your eyes to the experience of mi-
nority communities who face endless 
barriers to the ballot box. 
After Latinos, Native Americans, and 
Black Americans voted in historic 
numbers, State legislators moved to re-
strict voting in State after State. We 
have a constitutional duty to act. We 
must pass H.R. 4 to restore the promise 
and power of the Voting Rights Act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my Repub-
lican colleagues to join us. Taking 
away equal access to the polls and de-
fending voter suppression is not par-
tisan, it is un-American. 
f 
HONORING MARY SUE MIXON 
(Mr. FERGUSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize an outstanding 
woman of God, Mrs. Mary Sue Mixon. 
Mrs. Mixon will celebrate her retire-
ment as a distinguished Sunday school 
teacher at the Mountain Gap Church in 
The Rock, Georgia. 
Mary Sue Mixon is a native of Pike 
County, Georgia, and has taught Sun-
day school classes for adults, preteens, 
and primary classes for over 40 years. 
Beyond simply reading her weekly les-
sons to the fourth through sixth grade 
students, she has dedicated herself to 
sharing the full knowledge, love, and 
relationship she has with Christ, and 
has enabled countless others to walk 
with Him. 
Mary Sue is a revered teacher and a 
humble community leader, but above 
all, she is a faithful servant of God. She 
has achieved so much in her life, but 
none of it would be possible without 
the grace of the Lord, and the love and 
support of her family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me today, along with the con-
gregation of Mountain Gap Church, and 
the residents of Georgia’s Third Con-
gressional District, in extending our 
sincerest congratulations to Mary Sue 
Mixon on this joyous occasion. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, the 
Build Back Better agenda is simple, it 
tackles the biggest challenges facing 
working families by investing in what 
Americans need, from physical infra-
structure to education and child care. 
The feedback from my constituents 
has been clear, they need a hard infra-
structure bill, but we can’t stop there. 
Pennsylvania 
has 
more 
than 
3,000 
bridges and 7,500 miles of highway in 
poor condition. The infrastructure bill 
includes $11 billion for our highways 
and the largest bridge investment since 
we built the interstate highway sys-
tem. It will provide good jobs and lower 
costs to businesses. 
But we can’t stop with roads and 
bridges if we want America to succeed 
in the 21st century. Most Pennsylva-
nians can’t afford quality child care. 
The budget resolution would provide 
access to safe, reliable, high-quality 
care. We need to rebuild our public 
schools and construct affordable hous-
ing. We need to lower prescription drug 
costs and expand Medicare to include 
dental, hearing, and vision. 
Each of these investments will help 
working families and allow everyone, 
not just the rich, to participate in the 
21st century economy. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
passing this historic legislation. 
f 
RECOGNIZING COLTON GRIFFIN 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Colton Griffin, 
a third grader from Moville, Iowa. 
After his classmate and friend, Hope, 
passed away in a tragic accident, Col-
ton wanted to make sure her bucket 
calf still made it to the fair. 
That is when he came up with this 
great idea to have his whole class help 
show her calf, Taffy. I had the pleasure 
of meeting Colton, and his dad, Cody, 
at the Iowa State Fair last week, and 
they truly embody ‘‘Iowa Nice.’’ 
Supporting our friends and neighbors 
in tough times is one of the things that 
makes Iowa so special. With a heart 
that big, I know Colton is going to do 
great things. 
Madam Speaker, may God bless Col-
ton and his friend, Hope, and her fam-
ily. May God bless. 
f 
SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN 
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in gratitude for the service and sac-
rifice of the brave troops, diplomats, 
aid workers, and others who served in 
Afghanistan over the last 20 years, and 
for those who are still there on the 
ground working heroically to defend 
and evacuate American civilians and 
our Afghan partners. 
Madam Speaker, I remain deeply 
concerned about the deteriorating situ-
ation in Afghanistan, and I am calling 
on the administration to use every 
available tool to ensure that we not 
only protect and evacuate American 
personnel, but as many of our Afghan 
partners as possible. 
I applaud the administration for 
picking up the pace of evacuations over 
the weekend and for expanding the pe-
rimeter around the airport in Kabul in 
order to increase access for evacuees 
and to avoid the developing humani-
tarian crisis. 
But we cannot stop there. Thousands 
more are at risk, including journalists, 
women’s rights activists, and NGO em-
ployees. I am calling on President 
Biden to establish a special humani-
tarian program specifically for these 
groups and other highly visible activ-
ists in Afghanistan; to increase proc-
essing capacity at USCIS; and to im-
mediately ensure the safe exit from Af-
ghanistan of all priority 1 and 2 visa 
holders to third countries. 
Getting citizens out of harm’s way 
must remain our top priority, but we 
also cannot abandon our Afghan allies. 
f 
DO NOT FORGET WHAT IS HAP-
PENING ON OUR SOUTHERN BOR-
DER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
obviously a lot is going on in America 
right now, and with all the focus on 
what is going on in Afghanistan, as 
well as the latest spending bills going 
through Congress, we are perhaps los-
ing track of the thing that I think will 
have the biggest impact on America 
over the next few years. 
I beg the American public and the 
American media not to lose sight of 
what is going on at our southern bor-
der. In the last couple of weeks, it has 
become apparent that, by an estimate, 
105,000 people crossed over the border 
into that country as opposed to 80,000 
in June; over a 30 percent increase in 1 
month, almost entirely unremarked; of 
that is an estimated 15,000 unaccom-
panied minors, which is a human rela-
tions tragedy. 
It is going to further increase the 
amount of illegal drugs in this country. 
Right now, 90,000 people a year are 
dying of illegal drugs. It is hard to be-
lieve that this time last year only an 
estimated 8,000 people were coming in 
the country, whereas, this July, again, 
we are at 105,000. 
It should be banner headlines in any 
newspaper in this country when we go 
from about 10,000 people to 105,000 peo-
ple per month.

INVESTING IN CLIMATE 
RESILIENCY 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
the bipartisan infrastructure package 
makes important investments in our 
country’s roads, bridges, high-speed 
internet, and clean water. But to fully 
deliver on our Democratic agenda, we 
must also pass a budget reconciliation 
bill that invests in a top priority for 
my district: climate resiliency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4349 
August 23, 2021 
Climate change is an ever-present 
danger to our constituents and commu-
nities. Just yesterday, a tropical storm 
made landfall in my district with in-
tense winds of at least 47 miles per 
hour in southern New England. With 
communities at risk of flooding, prop-
erty damage, and loss of life with in-
creasingly harsh and dangerous storms, 
Congress must act. 
Massachusetts is a leader in miti-
gating and combating climate change, 
but the Commonwealth cannot do it 
alone. I urge my colleagues to vote to 
pass both the Build Back Better Act 
and the bipartisan infrastructure bill 
to take the necessary steps to end cli-
mate change. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FAILING 
AT KEEPING AMERICA SAFE 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, America is less safe today 
than when President Biden was sworn 
in 7 months ago. 
Last week, as the Taliban seized con-
trol of Afghanistan, they released 5,000 
al-Qaida and Taliban terrorists who are 
armed with $85 billion of U.S. taxpayer- 
funded weapons as a result of the Biden 
administration’s 
incompetent 
with-
drawal. Our allies have lost respect for 
America, and our enemies do not fear 
us. 
At the same time, Vice President 
Kamala Harris has left our southern 
border completely exposed and vulner-
able for anyone to cross, and over 
200,000 people are crossing each month. 
This is a national security disaster 
with dreadful future consequences. 
But we shouldn’t be surprised that 
Democrats are not concerned with pub-
lic safety. They have been promoting 
defund the police and supporting soft- 
on-crime policies that have caused 
crime to skyrocket this past year. 
The key role of government is to 
keep our families safe, and the Biden 
administration has failed miserably. 
f 
FIGHTING AGAINST GOP-LED 
VOTER DISCRIMINATION 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, as I 
stand here today, Republicans in the 
Texas State Legislature are rapidly ad-
vancing some of the most restrictive 
voting laws that we have seen in our 
Republic since the Voting Rights Act 
was passed in the 1960s. 
That is why it is so important that 
we pass H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, because H.R. 
4 will help us fight against this dan-
gerous GOP-led anti-voter discrimina-
tion that we are seeing, discrimination 
against the very voters who have 
fueled growth in our State and who are 
allowing Texas to pick up two new 
seats after reapportionment. 
It will help restore full protections of 
the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 
and re-implement the critically needed 
VRA preclearance provision to focus on 
States with a recent history of dis-
crimination, like the State that I live 
in. It is a State that has consistently 
pushed racially charged anti-voter leg-
islation that will allow everything 
from empowering partisan poll watch-
ers to intimidating Texas voters to im-
posing criminal penalties. 
We have to do something about this. 
Let’s pass H.R. 4. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. HONG 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Dr. Mike Myungki Hong, a giant in 
the Korean-American community who 
exemplified the American Dream. He 
was a personal friend, a mentor, a vi-
sionary, and a very generous philan-
thropist who touched the lives of so 
many people. 
Despite his success as an engineer 
and founder of Dura Coat Products, he 
was a very humble man who loved his 
wife, Lorrie, and his children very, 
very dearly. He spent his life giving 
back to his community and supporting 
the next generation of young leaders. 
Dr. Hong dedicated his life to car-
rying on the legacy of Dosan Ahn 
Chang Ho, a leader of the Korean inde-
pendence movement, with honesty, hu-
mility, integrity, and passion. 
The 
Korean-American 
community 
and I are indebted to Dr. Hong for his 
service and dedication. I pray that Dr. 
Hong’s love of our country and commu-
nity continues to live through us, and 
I pray for God’s peace for his family. 
f 
PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR 
AFGHANISTAN DEBACLE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on the 
ongoing disaster in Afghanistan. 
As a Vietnam-era veteran, I have 
seen the outcome of a poorly executed 
withdrawal, with tragic images of our 
allies hanging off of aircraft. 
The scene that unfolded at Hamid 
Karzai Airport in Kabul last week is a 
betrayal to the American military, 
American citizens, our Afghan partners 
who aided American troops in the glob-
al war on terrorism, and the Afghan 
people. 
The catastrophe that we have seen 
over the last few weeks was completely 
avoidable. We have watched as the 
Taliban quickly took control of the 
country, released terrorists from pris-
on, and began implementing sharia law 
on those we left behind. 
Just as important, we will have less 
safety of our homeland, and it will 
have lasting repercussions. 
Madam Speaker, one of the most 
basic things you learn in the military 
is to never give your enemy the upper 
hand. We gave the Taliban the upper 
hand when we broadcast our with-
drawal plans to the world but not to 
our allies and our coalition partners. 
The arbitrary and symbolic timeline 
the administration gave to get our 
troops out is during the peak of the 
fighting season. 
The administration needs to take full 
responsibility for this debacle. They 
are making the decisions and need to 
be held accountable for those decisions. 
The President said that the buck stops 
with him, but he has continued to 
point fingers and blame others. 
f 
THANKING THE CAPITOL POLICE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to thank the Capitol Police 
and all of those who really created a 
miracle in the midst of a potential 
bomb threat just about a week ago 
here in the United States Capitol 
again, and to thank them for their as-
tuteness and to recognize that, in spite 
of all of our commentary from our 
friends on the other side about the bor-
der, that the most serious threat here 
in the United States is domestic ter-
rorism, and there evidenced an indi-
vidual, whatever his condition was, 
wanting to bomb the Capitol. 
I thank them for their honest and se-
rious work and again credit them for 
their leadership. 
Finally, let me say that as we move 
toward the Voting Rights Act, H.R. 4, 
it is crucial because Texas Democratic 
representatives will be here over the 
next 2 days, the same people who had a 
civil arrest and were stalked in their 
own State because they refused to go 
to a session that was nothing but deny-
ing rights to vote to Texans—minori-
ties, ethnic minorities, language mi-
norities, denying them the right to 
vote. H.R. 4 is crucial. 
I thank them for their bravery and 
their service. 
Let’s get on with passing H.R. 4. 
f 
PRESIDENT EMBOLDENED 
TALIBAN 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
the Taliban is emboldened today. They 
have found a new reason to cry ‘‘death 
to America.’’ That reason is Joe Biden. 
His foreign policy is not America 
first; it is Taliban first. 
Mr. President, listen carefully, and I 
will say it slowly just for you: No man 
left behind. That is leadership. 
Here is my pledge to the Taliban: 
You may chant ‘‘death to America’’ 
today, but mark my words, the levers 
of power will be in strong hands soon. 
If you harm an American, we will rain

down vengeance upon you with wrath 
and fury that will put the fires of hell 
to shame. 
Psalm 91 promises us that God will 
be our refuge and our fortress. But you 
do not worship my God or heed His 
promises. So when we come for you, 
there will be no refuge, no cave, and no 
crevasse you can crawl into that will 
save you from our wrath. 
To those who hate America and all 
we stand for, read my lips: I am young, 
and I have a long memory. When power 
in Washington inevitably shifts, we 
will not forget you because we are in 
the business of killing terrorists. And 
pretty soon, business will be booming. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. SE-
WELL). Members are reminded to re-
frain from engaging in personalities to-
ward the President, and Members are 
also reminded to address their remarks 
to the Chair, not to a perceived viewing 
audience. 
f 
ADMINISTRATION BOTCHED 
AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, the situ-
ation in Afghanistan left behind by the 
President’s hasty withdrawal has been 
horrific. It has been unconscionable 
and unacceptable. 
We have thousands of American citi-
zens unable to get to the airport in 
Kabul 
because 
this 
administration 
botched the withdrawal, sent mixed 
messages, and undercut our allied part-
ners. 
Let me be clear: We should not leave 
Afghanistan until every single Amer-
ican citizen has been safely evacuated, 
period. 
For the last 20 years, our brave serv-
icemen and -women have served in Af-
ghanistan with honor, with valor, and 
with distinction. They have done ev-
erything that our country has asked of 
them and more. They deserve our grat-
itude and our respect. 
It is time for this President and this 
administration to do right by them, to 
rescue every single American, and to 
demonstrate the leadership that our 
country needs. At this point, Madam 
Speaker, that leadership is severely 
lacking. 
f 
REMEMBERING BRENDA LANNOM 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember a great Tennessean. 
A devoted wife and mother, Bible 
school teacher, and a true Volunteer in 
every 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
Brenda 
Lannom was a blessing to her family, 
her 
friends, 
her 
community, 
her 
church, and her country. 
As I remember Mrs. Lannom, I recog-
nize that she represents many great 
women, past and present, across Amer-
ica who choose every day to put the 
needs of their family ahead of their 
own. Women like Mrs. Lannom never 
hesitate to lend a helping hand or a lis-
tening ear. They are always there when 
a child needs to be scooped up and held 
close, like only a mother can do. They 
are the best friend and trusted partner 
of their spouse, even through life’s 
toughest challenges. And women like 
Mrs. Lannom spend a lifetime giving 
warm hugs and sharing sweet smiles 
that instantly provide assurance to 
those who need it most. 
America thrives because of women 
such as this. My district, my State, 
and this Nation need women like Bren-
da Lannom. The loss of such a special 
person brings great sadness, but we can 
be comforted knowing that she has 
surely gone home to be with her Lord 
and Savior, and what a fitting reward 
for such a faithful and lovely soul. 
f 
HONORING BILL HABEL 
(Mr. FOSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the life and work of 
Bill Habel, of Naperville, who passed 
away suddenly just a few weeks ago at 
the age of 63. 
Bill was a tireless champion for 
workers and their families, and he 
never missed an opportunity to help 
amplify their voices. He started his ca-
reer as a union electrician in 1986 and 
was a dedicated member of IBEW Local 
701. 
Beyond his day-to-day work, Bill 
made it a priority to give back and to 
help others begin their careers. He 
spent 23 years as an instructor for the 
electrical workers’ apprenticeship pro-
gram, helping introduce others to 
good-paying career opportunities in the 
building trades. 
He was a leading voice for the eco-
nomic development of the Naperville 
community and never missed a chance 
to advocate for job creation and infra-
structure development that attracted 
so many people to Naperville and to 
DuPage County. 
Madam Speaker, Bill knew instinc-
tively what many of us have learned, 
that when you prioritize workers and 
their families, the entire community 
benefits. Simply put, the Naperville 
community is a better place because of

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MAJOR GENERAL GARY HAR-
RELL 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Major General Gary Harrell, 
who is a distinguished veteran that has served 
our country in numerous combat operations 
and in both wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. After 
an accomplished career in service to our 
country, Gary retired as the Deputy Com-
manding General of the United States Army 
Special Operations Command. It is my privi-
lege to recognize him for his service and to 
honor his sacrifice to our country. 
Gary earned his bachelor’s degree in indus-
trial technology from East Tennessee State 
University in 1973. His distinguished career 
began shortly after when he was commis-
sioned as a Second Lieutenant and assigned 
to the 2nd Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment, 
82nd Airborne Division, where he served as a 
Rifle Platoon Leader and Anti-Tank (TOW) 
platoon leader. In 1977, having earned a 
Green Beret, he was assigned to the 7th Spe-
cial Forces Group in Panama. 
Gary was deployed to Grenada during ‘‘Op-
eration Urgent Fury,’’ and then took part in 
combat operations in Panama with ‘‘Operation 
Just Cause.’’ He was also sent to the Middle 
East during ‘‘Desert Shield’’ and ‘‘Desert 
Storm,’’ and as commander of the special op-
eration Delta Force, he was wounded by mor-
tar fire during United Nations relief efforts in 
Somalia, a story chronicled in the book and 
movie ‘‘Black Hawk Down.’’ 
In 2001, Gary was Assistant Division Com-
mander for the 10th Mountain Division in Af-
ghanistan, and during Operation Iraqi Free-
dom, he led the largest special operations 
force assembled since World War II. He re-
tired in 2008 as the Deputy Commanding 
General of the United States Army Special 
Operations Command. Gary’s awards and 
decorations include the Defense Superior 
Service Medal, the Bronze Star Medal (with V- 
device and 2 Oak Leaf Clusters), and the Pur-
ple Heart among many others. 
Gary is hailed as an expert in the special 
operations community, and he is highly re-
spected by his colleagues and friends. He has 
been described as having ‘‘unmatched exper-
tise,’’ and at his retirement ceremony in 2008, 
Lt. Gen. Robert Wagner stated, ‘‘If it was com-
plex, if it was difficult or critical to our nation, 
Gary was there.’’ When being inducted into 
the ETSU ROTC Hall of Fame, it was said 
that ‘‘to say General Harrell is a legend would 
be an absolute understatement.’’ 
In retirement, Gary has served in several 
roles, including as Director General for King 
Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center 
(KASOTC) in Amman, Jordan and Senior Vice 
President of Special Operations and Intel-
ligence Advisory Group for CUBIC Applica-
tions Inc. He and his wife, Jennifer, have been 
blessed with three children and six grand-
children. I am proud to join the chorus of 
Gary’s family, friends, colleagues, and admir-
ers in thanking him for his dedicated service to 
our Nation.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF COACH WILFRET ANDERSON, 
SR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of a remarkable individual, retired foot-
ball coach Wilfret Lewis Anderson, Sr. 
Coach Anderson was born to the late Lou-
ise and Lewis Anderson, Jr. on January 5, 
1937. He was called to his Heavenly Home on 
August 3, 2021, with his family by his side. He 
accepted Christ as his Savior at an early age 
and was a faithful member of Pratt Memorial 
United Methodist Church in Jackson, Mis-
sissippi. 
As a young man at Jim Hill High School, 
Coach Anderson was a member of the 
School’s choir, the first football team, and the 
track team. He received his B.S. Degree in 
Physical Education in 1962 and M.S. Degree 
in Physical Education in 1978 from Jackson 
State College. Throughout his childhood and 
college years, he excelled in sports, which 
served as a significant foundation for him as 
a successful coach for many years. Upon 
graduating from college, Coach Anderson ac-
cepted a teaching position at Jim Hill High 
School, where he was the first graduate to re-
turn for a teaching position. He spent over 25 
years as a dedicated teacher, coach, mentor, 
and father figure to many students while 
teaching and coaching at the old Jim Hill High 
School (Blackburn Jr. High School), Whitten 
Jr. High School, Jim Hill High School, and 
Provine High School. 
Coach Anderson was a man with many tal-
ents, and he wore many hats. Known as a 
reasonable disciplinarian, he always main-
tained a very uplifting, encouraging, and hu-
morous personality. He was by far an ex-
tended version of a people-person and always 
concerned about the well-being of his family, 
church members, co-workers, and students. 
He will never be forgotten but missed by 
many. 
Coach Anderson leaves to cherish his 
memories: a devoted wife of 25 years, Gene-
va 
Hunt-Anderson, 
and 
children—Cynthia 
(Travis, Sr.) Ricks of Detroit, MI, Lynette 
Myles of Chicago, IL, and Derrick Martin of 
Burbank, CA. Four sons were born to the mat-
rimony of Coach Anderson and Shirley Ander-
son Spann—Wilfret (Cynthia) Anderson, Jr. of 
Hollywood, FL, Marcus J. Anderson, Kenneth 
Anderson, and Dr. Brian Anderson, of Jack-
son, MS. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Coach Wilfret Lewis Anderson, Sr.

RECOGNIZING 
STAFF 
SERGEANT 
NICHOLAS 
J. 
JONES, 
UNITED 
STATES MARINE CORPS 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Staff Sergeant Nicholas J. Jones, United 
States Marine Corps, for his honorable and 
devoted service to our great nation. Staff Ser-
geant Nicholas J. Jones will be presented the 
Navy Cross by Marine Corps Commandant 
General David H. Berger during an August 26, 
2021 ceremony at Camp Lejeune, North Caro-
lina. 
The Navy Cross is our nation’s second high-
est military decoration for valor awarded to a 
member of the U.S. Armed Forces who exhib-
its extraordinary heroism during combat. Staff 
Sergeant Nicholas J. Jones, of the 2nd Marine 
Raider Battalion, is an American hero who 
risked life and limb on March 8, 2020 con-
ducting a counterattack against an ISIS 
stronghold in the Makhmur Mountains of Iraq. 
His fearless leadership and daring attitude 
saved countless lives that day. Our service 
members and our nation are safer because of 
his selflessness and decisiveness. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the sacrifice and service given by Staff Ser-
geant Nicholas J. Jones. On behalf of the 
United States Congress, we thank Staff Ser-
geant Jones, and his family for his unwavering 
commitment to our nation. God bless our Ma-
rines and God bless the United States of 
America. Semper Fidelis.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF NAVY FIREMAN FIRST CLASS 
PAUL E. SAYLOR 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Navy Fireman First Class 
Paul E. Saylor, who, as a 21-year-old, was as-
signed to serve on the USS Oklahoma. The 
Oklahoma was moored at Ford Island in berth 
Fox 5 on Battleship Row of Pearl Harbor on 
the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, when it was at-
tacked by Japanese aircraft. The ship sus-
tained multiple torpedo hits, which caused it to 
quickly capsize and resulted in the death of 
429 crewman, including Saylor. His remains 
were recovered, but not identified and ac-
counted for until Nov. 24, 2020. 
Saylor was born in 1920 in the First District 
of Tennessee in Bluff City to the Reverend

Samuel and Mary Saylor. Reverend Saylor 
was a Free Will Baptist minister whose min-
istry took the family to both Unicoi and Carter 
Counties in Tennessee as well as Mitchell 
County, North Carolina before they settled in 
Johnson City, Tennessee. Paul was the third 
of four sons born to the Saylors. 
Saylor’s legacy included not only service to 
his country but his admirable character, as 
well. Letters that he wrote to his family during 
his year in the United States Navy revealed 
his intelligence, his strong work ethic, and his 
generous spirit. 
Growing up the son of a Free Will Baptist 
minister during the Great Depression gave 
Paul a deeply personal understanding of the 
financial burden his family faced. Lower en-
listed men received very little pay during the 
early 1940s however, Paul’s letters indicated 
that he was sending money home to his par-
ents showing a strong sense of responsibility. 
He also was driven to succeed as his writings 
revealed that he figured out early that if he 
studied hard and passed his exams he could 
be promoted. His time of service was just over 
a year, but he was quickly promoted to Fire-
man First Class. 
Paul Saylor’s remains were unidentified, like 
many others, until modem analysis revealed 
his identity, allowing him to be brought home 
for a proper burial on August 20, 2021. Al-
though his life was tragically cut short, his 
memory will continue to live and generations 
to come will see his name recorded on the 
Walls of the Missing at the Punchbowl, along 
with the others who are missing from WWII. A 
rosette will be placed next to his name to indi-
cate he has been accounted for. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Navy Fireman First Class Paul E. Saylor’s leg-
acy and ultimate sacrifice to our Nation. He 
represents the spirit and sacrifice that has 
made the First District of Tennessee as well 
as these United States, great.

HONORING LULA WINDLESS BOYD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant, Lula Windless Boyd. 
Lula was born on September 26, 1949, in 
Marks, MS. She is the fourth child of eleven 
children (8 girls and 3 boys) born to the late 
Matthew and Ruth Hodo Windless. She grew 
up in the Squirrel Lake community in Darling, 
MS. She has a host of nieces and nephews. 
This family sticks together like glue. It’s never 
a dull moment during family gatherings. When 
one hurt, they all hurt. Trending technology 
has allowed this family to communicate with 
each other daily, literally all day. Her phone 
chimes all day because of the messages she 
receives from her family members. 
Lula is the mother of three lovely children, 
Tywonda Boyd, Lynette Moffett, and Marcus 
Boyd. She is a grandmother to 5 grand-
children, granny to 5 great-grandchildren, and 
granny to 7 extended grandchildren, she loves 
all of them very much. There’s no limit to what 
she would do for her family. She has an end-
less list of individuals she calls her friend, fam-
ily member, or church member. 
Lula is a faithful member of New Bethel Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Darling, MS, under 
Gregory Coleman’s leadership. She confessed 
a hope in Christ at an early age and has been 
a member of this church all her life under dif-
ferent pastors. She has been the Financial 
Secretary for over thirty-plus years, and she 
enjoys her position there. 
Lula graduated from Quitman County High 
School in May 1966. She also attended 
Coahoma Community College and graduated 
in May 1968 and Mississippi Valley State Uni-
versity from 1968 to 1969. Her first work expe-
rience was at Falcon Junior High School in 
Falcon, MS, as a Teacher Assistant. Her sec-
ond work experience was at Delta Hills Head 
Start Central Office in Holly Springs, MS, as a 
payroll clerk from September 1970 to May 
1977. Other jobs included Mississippi Depart-
ment of Corrections Office Clerk from July 
1977 to September 1978, Wilsew Manufac-
turing in Sledge, MS, as a payroll clerk, and 
lastly the Mississippi Department of Human 
Services as an Eligibility Worker, and she later 
became a Case Manager. She was a faithful 
employee at the Mississippi Department of 
Human Services from August 1981 to April 
2014. She retired on April 16, 2014 and began 
living her best life. 
Currently, Lula is enjoying her retirement by 
giving back to the community. Before the pan-
demic, she often volunteered at the Quitman 
County nursing home. She is the type that sel-
dom says no when asked to complete a task 
either in the community or at church. She en-
joys helping individuals in the community, 
spending time with her family, cooking, gar-
dening, traveling, and doing things she could 
not do while working an 8 to 5 job. 
She lived to see two significant milestones: 
her 50th year graduating from high school, 
May 2016, and her 50th year graduating from 
Coahoma Community College, May 2018. Our 
family is proud to call her mother, grand-
mother, great grandmother, sister, aunt, and 
cousin. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Lula Windless Boyd for 
her dedication in serving her community.

IN RECOGNITION OF ONEIDA NA-
TION’S CONSERVATION EFFORTS 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the Oneida Nation for receiving 
the Lake Michigan Champions of Conservation 
Award. 
The Lake Michigan Champions of Con-
servation Award honors people, programs, 
community groups, and businesses for out-
standing achievements in the restoration, pro-
tection, or promotion of Lake Michigan. The 
Oneida Nation continuously provides critical 
services and programs to preserve, restore, 
and enhance our environment, and are ex-
tremely deserving of this recognition. 
The Oneida Nation has a long history of 
caring for our environment and understands 
that preserving and protecting the environment 
is a responsibility given to us all by our cre-
ator. The Oneida Nation has made environ-
mental conservation a priority, administering 
conservation programs, like the Tribal Environ-
mental Response Program, a program in-
tended to address the release of hazardous 
and regulated materials into the environment. 
Additionally, the Oneida Nation has played a 
crucial role in the restoration of our watershed 
by returning wildlife habitat land back into nat-
ural areas, wetlands, forests, and grasslands. 
They also frequently partner with local govern-
ments, agencies, and private landowners to 
continue improving water quality standards lo-
cally. 
The Oneida Nation offers unique community 
education programs consistent with the cul-
ture, vision, and priorities of the Oneida Na-
tion. The Nation works to weave Traditional 
Ecological Knowledge (TEK) practices into 
each of their projects by incorporating cultural 
information and practices. To further raise 
awareness, they opened their restoration 
projects to field tours and educational experi-
ences by other resource professionals and in-
terest groups. 
The Oneida Nation’s service to the con-
servation of Northeastern Wisconsin has been 
incredibly valuable and is deeply appreciated 
by the members of our community. The Onei-
da Nation’s sincere efforts do not go unno-
ticed. I commend the Nation for all its efforts 
to be champions of conservation in Northeast 
Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in congratulating the Oneida 
Nation for receiving the Lake Michigan Cham-
pions of Conservation Award.

HONORING MAPLE L. CAMPBELL 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant, Ms. Maple L. Campbell. 
Ms. Campbell was born in June 1963, in 
Doddsville, Mississippi, located in Sunflower 
County. She is currently a resident of 
Indianola, Mississippi. There she graduated 
from Gentry High School in 1981. Afterwards, 
she matriculated to Mississippi Valley State 
University, where she graduated, as a two- 
time honor scholar, with a Bachelor of Science 
Degree in Education in 2008. 
Ms. Campbell has dedicated her life to serv-
ing others. A fulfilling life according to Ms. 
Campbell, ‘‘is not focused on financial wealth 
(although it helps) but rather on helping others 
who are in need. We all need help in life, and 
we are all servants in some capacity. My pub-
lic service journey started as a teacher in the 
school system and then I moved over to 
health care. I have a sister that is disabled 
from birth, and finding the right facility and 
care for her has always been a challenge for 
my parents. My entire family help my parents 
take care of her.’’ 
Ms. Campbell’s life as an Educator began in 
1998 as the Family Support Technical Spe-
cialist and Advocate Volunteer for Project Em-
power (Greenville, MS). In that position she 
worked with mental health officials and the 
Mississippi State Department of Education to 
improve services for students with special 
needs within the Indianola and Greenville Pub-
lic School District. In 2005, Ms. Campbell was 
employed as the Tutor within Spencer’s Learn-
ing Center. She provided on-site tutoring for 
students in grades Pre-K to First Grade in 
subject matter areas of reading, language arts, 
math, science, and social studies. From 2006 
to 2008 and 2009 to 2011, she worked for the 
Indianola School District in different roles. First 
as the Career Center Manager for the Voca-
tional Center, then in 2009 as the Family and 
Consumer Science Teacher for the Vocational 
Center. In 2010, Ms. Campbell taught Family 
and Consumer Science for the Tunica County 
School District in Tunica, MS. 
Ms. Campbell’s life in Health Care began in 
2016, when she and her sister, Minnie Pearl 
Campbell started the Platinum Plus Care As-
sisted Living Facility at 617 Highway 82 West, 
Indianola, MS. Ms. Maple Campbell is the 
CEO and Administrator. The Campbell sisters 
made history, becoming the first Black/Black 
female Women owned business of its kind and 
operates a full-time assisted living facility in 
Indianola. Platinum Plus Care Assisted Living 
Facility is a twenty-seven-bed facility that of-
fers 24-hours and 365 days a year of care to 
disabled, mentally ill, veterans and elderly 
adults. They provide care in the areas of ad-
ministering and monitoring of medication, per-
sonal care (bathing and dressing), transpor-
tation and personal assistance to medical ap-
pointments, care coordination with medical 
providers, social and recreational activities, 
housekeeping and laundry, exercise, nutritious 
and healthy meals, a social and engaging en-
vironment, and more. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Maple Campbell for her 
dedication to being a public servant.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BAYARD 
RUSTIN STAMP ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the Bayard Rustin Stamp Act. 
This bill would direct the United States Post-
master General to issue a forever stamp to 
commemorate the life and work of Bayard 
Rustin. I introduce this bill with Representa-
tives MONDAIRE JONES and RITCHIE TORRES. 
We introduce the bill now to coincide with the 
anniversary of the March on Washington, 
which occurred on August 28, 1963, and the 
anniversary of Rustin’s death, which occurred 
on August 24, 1987. 
Born March 17, 1912, Bayard Rustin be-
came one of the most important leaders in the 
20th century civil rights movement. At a young 
age, Rustin learned the values of nonviolence 
and peacekeeping from his grandparents’ 
Quaker faith, and he would continue to build 
these values into his life as a civil rights move-
ment leader. 
Rustin attended City College of New York, 
where he joined a progressive club that aimed 
to remedy racial issues during turbulent times. 
His time with the club was short-lived, but it in-
spired him to join the Fellowship of Reconcili-
ation, an organization that became a cham-
pion for labor rights, equity and world peace. 
Rustin’s time with the Fellowship of Rec-
onciliation led him to become a leader in the 
1947 ‘‘Journey to Reconciliation,’’ where white 
and black people across the South rode buses 
together to challenge segregation laws, a pre-
cursor to the Freedom Rides. 
Rustin was an advisor in Martin Luther King 
Jr.’s inner circle as King advocated pacifism 
and nonviolence for achieving equal treatment 
for African Americans. Rustin applied his bril-
liant strategic mind to execute aggressive, 
peaceful action in the civil rights movement 
and throughout his life as an activist. 
His most important role was as the chief or-
ganizer of the historic 1963 March on Wash-
ington, the largest demonstration ever orga-
nized at the time, in which a quarter of a mil-
lion people turned out to demand civil rights 
for African Americans. 
In the years after the civil rights movement, 
Rustin, a gay man, inspired others to advocate 
for and to achieve LGBTQ rights. He remained 
a strategist and public speaker for workers’ 
rights movements, including co-founding the 
A. Philip Randolph Institute for black trade 
union members. Rustin remained committed to 
promoting social good, and advocating for the 
disenfranchised, until his death. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MS. JEWELL BELL 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Ms. Jewell Bell, a beloved 
pillar of King University and Bristol, Ten-
nessee. Ms. Bell has dedicated over 70 years 
of service to this excellent academic institution 
and the well-being of its students. Her tenure 
spans nearly half of King’s 152-year history. 
She began as a maid in the women’s dor-
mitory. In 1961, while Bristol’s public schools 
were still segregated, she was promoted to 
switchboard Operator and Supervisor and 
given a staff of 10 assistants. She was the 
first African American in the region to manage 
a switchboard, for which she became affec-
tionately known as ‘‘Ma Bell.’’ In 1966, her 
son, Lawrence, Jr. became the first African 
American student to attend King. As the Exec-
utive Administrative Assistant for Communica-
tions, she remains the voice of King, answer-
ing calls and serving the President’s office. 
Jewell’s legacy of community service is no-
table as well. She has earned the Algenon 
Sydney Sullivan Award, the YWCA’s Tribute to 
Women Award, the first ever King University 
Lifetime Achievement Award, her own lane on 
the campus named after her, and being de-
clared an Aide-de-Camp by former Tennessee 
Governor Bill Haslam, an honor that carries 
with it the title of Tennessee Colonel. In addi-
tion, King University offers a scholarship 
named the Jewell H. Bell Scholarship, which 
goes to help students who, as she describes, 
‘‘have fallen through the cracks and need a lit-
tle extra help to stay in school.’’ She has de-
voted many years of service to the YWCA of 
Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, 
the American Red Cross, Slater Community 
Center, Healing Hands Health Center, and 
Lee Street Baptist Church. While her children 
were in school, she served on the PTA and 
was the first African American PTA Council 
President in the Bristol, Tennessee, city 
school system. 
Her legacy of love includes being married to 
her late husband, Lawrence, for 50 years, 
three grown children, seven grandchildren, 13 
great-grandchildren, 
and 
one 
great-great- 
grandchild. In her words, she says ‘‘my chil-
dren are grown now, but King is still my home, 
the students are my family and I love them. 
Some of my family call me Gran, some call 
me GG, JB, Miss Jewell, plain Jewell, Mrs. 
Bell, or Ma Bell. I feel like God has enabled 
me to be here so long because of them, and 
I believe I’ve made an impact.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Jewell Bell has been a 
source of wisdom, compassion and support for 
students and alumni, as well as a strong com-
munity advocate for racial equality and posi-
tive change and I proudly honor her.

Along the way, he mentored and inspired 
many young adults to serve in law enforce-
ment including one, Matt Grooms; who went 
on to become a United States Border Patrol 
Agent and eventually an agent with the De-
partment of Homeland Security. Mr. Lawson 
was a self-employed business owner and his 
flexible schedule enabled him to serve his fel-
low citizens as their Constable. 
For decades he served the citizens of 
Sevier County as a Constable with the familiar 
slogan, ‘‘my services as your Constable are 
always as close as your telephone’’ and as 
the times changed, he offered his personal 
cell phone to his fellow citizens to be available 
to them. He was a member of the Fraternal 
Order of Police and at one point served as a 
deputy Sheriff in Sevier County. He helped 
lives including his own Sheriff in one dan-
gerous setting and pulled a woman to safety 
and saved her from drowning in the Little Pi-
geon River. He was a true public servant. 
George’s legacy of love includes his mar-
riage to his wonderful wife, Charlotte, and his 
children, Cindy, Tammy and son, Little George 
Stephen, who have given he and Charlotte 
seven grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, George Lawson has faith-
fully served his community and family, and I 
proudly honor him.

(BBER) at the University of New Mexico in Al-
buquerque. As head of BBER, Dr. Mitchell 
oversaw the economic forecasting for the en-
tire state. He directed economic analysis and 
projections that assisted private businesses, 
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, 
and cities, and towns. His regular presen-
tations were followed closely by CEOs, polit-
ical leaders, and community advocates. Jeff 
brought sharp insights, expert research, keen 
wit, and deep compassion to his leadership 
and policy roles. He believed firmly that eco-
nomic analysis and community development 
should benefit the greater society and foster a 
broadly shared prosperity. 
Jeff was also a community builder. He ac-
tively worked with nonprofits to promote re-
newable energy and sustainable development 
and was a policy advisor to 1000 Friends of 
New Mexico. He co-founded SHARE New 
Mexico, a comprehensive, web-based re-
source directory that ensures everyone simi-
larly dedicated to improving our communities 
has the information they need. As an econo-
mist, he used numbers and math to perform 
his work, but most importantly he relied on his 
love for our beloved communities to guide it. 
Jeff’s passion for life and discovery cannot 
be distinguished from his professional accom-
plishments. As a young adult, Jeff hitchhiked 
across the United States and Central America 
with a book of philosophy in his backpack, cu-
rious to learn about these great lands and 
their peoples. He was a humanitarian from an 
early age, and he started his career working 
on housing and energy projects for low-in-
come communities. He was a Fulbright schol-
ar in Venezuela and traveled through every 
corner of New Mexico and the world, working 
and learning. It was that never-ending sense 
of curiosity that helped make Jeff’s career— 
and life—so full. 
Jeff especially loved the arts and cultures of 
New Mexico and was the lead author of a 
groundbreaking report that found that they 
contributed $5.6 billion to the state’s economy 
and nearly 10 percent of its jobs. His work on 
this issue even helped inform legislation I in-
troduced—the Creative Economy Revitaliza-
tion Act—to create jobs and support our cre-
ative workers through the pandemic. 
Jeff will be deeply missed by his friends, 
loved ones, and family. He left us too soon, 
and we will always remember him. Jeff’s work, 
wisdom, and curious spirit will echo throughout 
New Mexico and across our country for gen-
erations to come. It is my honor to enshrine 
his contributions to our state, culture, and 
economy in history.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF HONORABLE TOM WRIGHT 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the Honorable Tom Wright of 
Greeneville, Tennessee. Mr. Wright currently 
serves as Circuit Court Judge for the State of 
Tennessee’s Third Judicial District. He was 
elected to the position in 2006 and reelected 
in 2014. Prior to his election as Circuit Judge, 
he served for eight years as the General Ses-
sions and Juvenile Judge for Greene County, 
Tennessee, having been elected to that posi-
tion in 1998. Judge Wright will be retiring Sep-
tember 1 to spend more time with his family, 
including two children, their spouses, and 
grandchildren at two separate Army bases, 
with the third grandchild coming soon. 
Tom graduated from the University of Ten-
nessee College of Law with high honors in 
1983 and was selected for membership in the 
Order of the Coif. Following his graduation 
from law school, he worked briefly for Campus 
Crusade for Christ before accepting a position 
as a Judicial Law Clerk for United States Dis-
trict Judge Thomas G. Hull. 
Tom was in the private practice of law for 
several years following the judicial clerkship 
then accepted the position of Assistant Fed-
eral Community Defender for upper East Ten-
nessee. He served as Federal Defender for 
six years before his election as Judge in 1998. 
Judge Wright has been active with the 
Greeneville High School football team as their 
chaplain, Young Life, and Fellowship of Chris-
tian Athletes. He says, ‘‘I thank God for the 
opportunity to mentor, teach, and encourage 
these folks in their faith. Serving the State of 
Tennessee and the people of the Third Judi-
cial District has been one of the greatest hon-
ors of my life. I am so incredibly grateful to 
God and the people of Greene, Hawkins, 
Hamblen, and Hancock counties for giving me 
the opportunity.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Judge Tom Wright has 
been an outstanding judge and valuable con-
tributor to the Greeneville community. I proud-
ly honor him.

BIDEN ENDANGERS AMERICAN 
FAMILIES 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, during my service in Congress, I 
have concluded over 500 one-minute speech-
es with ‘‘God Bless our Troops and we will 
never forget September 11th in the Global 
War on Terrorism.’’ 
This reaffirmed my appreciation of our mili-
tary for keeping Americans safe for 20 years. 
The 2,312 U.S. military personnel killed and 
20,666 wounded in Afghanistan did not serve 
in vain. I know firsthand of the achievements 
of former S.C. Adjutant General Bob Living-
ston with the 218th Brigade across Afghani-
stan. I am a grateful dad of an Afghanistan 
Veteran with First Lieutenant Hunter Wilson. 
But my hopes for remembering September 
11th were misplaced. The conquest by the 
Taliban and Al Qaeda this past week confirms 
that the shocking lesson of September 11th 
has been forgotten: it is possible to conduct a 
terrorist attack on American families at home 
from a cave in Afghanistan abroad resulting in 
the mass murder of 2,977 innocent souls. 
General David Petraeus is sadly correct, the 
war is not over. It has moved. Now it is closer, 
putting American families at the greatest risk 
of a terrorist attack ever, with chants of ‘‘Death 
to America, Death to Israel.’’ 
President Joe Biden undercut our Afghan al-
lies on April 14th, removing air cover and intel-
ligence reports against the advice of military 
leaders. Over 60,000 Afghan military and po-
lice have been killed fighting Taliban terrorists. 
Former Ambassador Ryan Crocker, a valued 
resource of experience in the Global War on 
Terrorism, correctly asserted that the situation 
is 
‘‘catastrophic.’’ 
President 
Biden 
must 
change course immediately and accept mili-
tary counsel or he will be further diminished as 
a personification of catastrophic failure in the 
horrific tradition of appeasement like Neville 
Chamberlain. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops and we 
should never forget September 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism.
