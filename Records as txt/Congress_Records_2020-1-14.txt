104TH PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, recently, I had the pleas-
ure of kicking off the new year by at-
tending the 104th Pennsylvania Farm 
Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the 
largest indoor agriculture exposition in 
the world. 
The Pennsylvania Farm Show dates 
back to 1917, when the first event show-
cased 44 commercial exhibitors fea-
turing the latest in farm machinery 
and 440 competitive exhibitors. Since 
then, the Pennsylvania Farm Show has 
become the largest indoor agriculture 
exhibition in the would. 
Dr. Milton Eisenhower, Penn State 
University president at the time and 
brother of President Dwight Eisen-
hower, dubbed the Pennsylvania Farm 
Show ‘‘always the greatest show on 
Earth’’ during his 1955 visit. 
Thanks to the sustained dedication 
by Pennsylvania farmers and farm fam-
ilies, tens of thousands of volunteers, 
and generations of agribusiness owners, 
the Pennsylvania Farm Show con-
tinues to be the greatest show on 
Earth. Today, the Pennsylvania Farm 
Show has grown to approximately 6,000 
animals, 12,000 exhibits, and 600,000 
visitors throughout the week. 
Each year, I host a congressional lis-
tening session at the farm show to hear 
directly from farmers, industry ex-
perts, and the agriculture advocates 
about their priorities as well as their 
concerns. 
I want to say thank you to Rep-
resentatives JOHN JOYCE, FRED KELLER, 
and DAN MEUSER, as well as Senator 
BOB
CASEY
and Pennsylvania Agri-
culture Secretary Russell Redding, for 
joining me for the 2020 congressional 
listening session at the farm show. 
Even after more than a decade of 
serving on the House Agriculture Com-
mittee, there is no experience that re-
places the value of meeting with our 
farmers, ranchers, and producers face- 
to-face. 
With the right policies and good in-
vestments, rural America can be just 
as strong as the hardworking men and 
women who call it home. A robust 
rural America is not possible without a 
strong rural economy, and thanks to 
the passage of the United States-Mex-
ico-Canada trade agreement and a 
soon-to-be-signed 
agreement 
with 
China, new market opportunities for 
agricultural exports are on the horizon. 
New markets are the key to economic 
growth and stability for our farm fami-
lies. 
Stability also means having reliable 
safety net programs in place when 
times are particularly tough and when 
the weather is threatening our ability 
to feed ourselves. Over the years, tech-
nology has advanced and the economy 
has diversified, and keeping up with 
the demands of a new era is necessary 
to compete in the modern marketplace. 
With connectivity, broadband, and, 
specifically, 5G, rural businesses will 
be 
better 
equipped 
to 
compete. 
Connectivity also expands opportuni-
ties for the next generation in rural 
America, helping signal to younger 
people that rural America is a great 
place to call home, to start a business, 
and to raise a family. 
After spending several days at the 
Pennsylvania Farm Show, I am in-
creasingly confident that the future of 
rural America is bright.

RECOGNIZING CHRISTINE 
KUSTELSKI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Christine Kustelski, 
the Southside unit director of the Boys 
& Girls Club of Central Minnesota, for 
her recent induction into the Youth 
Intervention Hall of Fame. This pres-
tigious honor, one that only 86 individ-
uals have received over the last 21 
years, is given to members of our com-
munity who go above and beyond just 
working with our Nation’s youth. 
Since 1997, Christine has worked in 
youth development at the Boys & Girls 
Club of Central Minnesota, serving 
nearly 1,200 K–12 youth. Christine as-
sists a range of students, working with 
children living in foster care or with 
incarcerated parents or those who have 
experienced abuse, neglect, and severe 
poverty.

I thank Christine for meeting the 
needs of the youth in our community 
and for her service to others in need. I 
congratulate her on earning her place 
in the Youth Intervention Hall of 
Fame. 
RECOGNIZING THE ANOKA COUNTY HUMAN 
SERVICES STAFF 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the Human Services 
staff in Anoka County, Minnesota, for 
receiving the Local Government Inno-
vation 
Award. 
These 
Innovation 
Awards 
highlight 
counties, 
cities, 
townships, and schools that have found 
ways to make a bigger impact in their 
communities. 
Anoka County developed a new ap-
prenticeship program called the Em-
powers Program. This volunteer initia-
tive provides employment and training 
opportunities to the workforce of to-
morrow. 
In a nation struggling with work-
force shortages and a growing skills 
gap, this program helps young people 
identify what they want to do with 
their career. The program assists the 
participants with job searches, indi-
vidual career planning, paid training, 
and achieving technical and occupa-
tional certificates. The program can 
even assist with basic needs like a bus 
pass, clothing for work, or books for 
school. 
Anoka County deserves to be recog-
nized for its efforts to prepare our 
young people to join the workforce. 
With 7 million open jobs in this coun-
try, our young people need to be 
equipped to join our growing economy. 
I congratulate Anoka County. 
RECOGNIZING
ELK
RIVER
AREA
SCHOOL
DIS-
TRICT’S EXCELLENCE IN TECHNOLOGICAL EDU-
CATION 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Elk River Area 
School District. As we closed out 2019, 
Elk River received an award for the 
district’s efforts to lead in educational 
approaches 
involving 
technology. 
Sourcewell Technology’s annual Im-
pact 
Education 
Conference 
named 
technology specialists and leaders from 
the Elk River Area School District as 
the 2019 Technology Team of the Year. 
Elk River earned this prestigious 
award because of the work the dis-
trict’s technology team undertook to 
expand the services they provide to 
their students. Elk River now provides 
on-demand courses for teachers as well 
as online resources and training for 
students and families. In total, the Elk 
River Area School District has imple-
mented e-learning options that are now 
available for nearly 14,000 students. 
We are fortunate for such incredible 
educators dedicated to innovating for 
their learners. I congratulate all the 
educators and administrators at Elk 
River Area School District for winning 
this well-deserved award. 
RECOGNIZING RIVERS OF HOPE, NEIGHBORHOOD 
HEROES HELPING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIO-
LENCE 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Rivers of Hope, a 
community-coordinated 
response 
to 
domestic violence. 
In the summer of 1989, a group of 
neighbors concerned about an increase 
in domestic violence banded together 
to create Rivers of Hope to provide vic-
tims with care and support from their 
community. 
Today, Rivers of Hope has expanded 
its scope of service, offering legal advo-
cacy, education, support groups, refer-
rals, and a 24/7 free and confidential 
crisis line for victims of domestic vio-
lence. The organization also operates a 
youth program and a criminal justice 
intervention program. 
In addition, Rivers of Hope has grown 
beyond the neighbors who founded the 
organization to now include corporate 
professionals, business leaders, public 
servants, public servants from Wright 
and Sherburne Counties, and other 
community leaders. 
I thank everyone who offers their 
time and effort to Rivers of Hope, mak-
ing it the vital resource for victims in 
our communities. We are grateful for 
their dedication to making the Sixth 
Congressional District a better place to 
live and a safe place for everyone.

LOST JOBS AT WHITE MESA URA-
NIUM MILL AND THE LA SAL 
URANIUM MINE COMPLEX 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. CURTIS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the hardworking 
Utahns in the uranium industry in San 
Juan County, and especially those who 
have recently lost their jobs at the 
White Mesa uranium mill and the La 
Sal uranium mine complex. 
Unfortunately, foreign subsidization 
of uranium production has had a dev-
astating impact on North American 
production and has affected the mill’s 
operation; and, as a result, roughly 30 
percent of the employees had to be let 
go at our Nation’s last operating ura-
nium mill. 
In addition to producing critical min-
erals, this mill has provided families 
with good incomes and generated tax 
dollars to help the local infrastructure. 
In fact, this facility is the largest pri-
vate employer in San Juan County. 
Since my election to Congress, I have 
had the privilege to spend significant 
time in the rural parts of Utah, includ-
ing San Juan County. I appreciate 
rural Utah’s sense of community and 
desire to help their neighbors during a 
time of need. 
Unlike the more urban parts of Utah 
with a business hiring on every corner, 
rural areas often have fewer economic 
opportunities. 
However, 
the 
hard-
working 
and 
entrepreneurial 
spirit 
among the residents of San Juan Coun-
ty make me confident they will be suc-
cessful in their fight through this dif-
ficult time and, ultimately, come out 
stronger for it. 
Additionally, I am committed to cre-
ating new economic opportunities in 
rural areas. Rural Utahns deserve the 
same quality of life that their urban 
friends 
have, 
including 
access 
to 
broadband, quality medical care, and 
good-paying jobs. I will continue to 
work in Congress to bring these vital 
services to rural Utah. 
While it has been a difficult week for 
many in San Juan County, I know the 
community will be resilient and per-
severe.

REMEMBERING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
GEORGIA 
STATE 
REPRESENTA-
TIVE JAY POWELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Georgia State Representative Jay Pow-
ell, who passed away in late November 
at the age of 67. 
At the time of his passing, Rep-
resentative Powell had served in the 
Georgia General Assembly for 10 years 
and had dedicated his time in public 
service to helping the rural areas of 
our State. His colleagues remember 
him as a straightforward talker and re-
member that, if he said he was going to 
do something, he did it. 
A testament to his honest character, 
during his tenure, he rose to be one of 
the most powerful members of the as-
sembly as the chairman of the Rules 
Committee. There, he played a large 
part in deciding which bills came up for 
a vote. 
One of his most important priorities 
included introducing a bill that would 
require small fees collected by the 
State, like police fines, to be spent ex-
actly where taxpayers are told they 
would be spent. 
Representative Powell is going to be 
deeply missed in Georgia and through-
out rural Georgia. His family and 
friends will be in my thoughts and 
prayers during this most difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING PETTY OFFICER 2ND CLASS 
NATHAN NEWBERG 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Petty Offi-
cer 2nd Class Nathan Newberg for being 
named USO Coast Guardsman of the 
Year for 2019. 
Stationed in Savannah, Georgia, I am 
so proud that the USO recognized Offi-
cer Newberg for his brave efforts to res-
cue the crew of an overturned cargo 
ship off the coast of the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia. 
In early September, Officer Newberg 
responded to a 3 a.m. call about the 
Golden Ray cargo ship capsizing. In 
early September, he was subsequently 
lowered from a helicopter, crossed 
along the side of the ship, and de-
scended inside to rescue the Golden 
Ray’s captain and a bar pilot. His ef-
fort, along with the rest of the Coast 
Guard, rescued all 24 of the ship’s crew. 
In addition to his work with the 
Golden Ray, he has helped evacuate in-
dividuals with health conditions from 
cruise ships, worked to recover coast-
guardsmen’s bodies that were missing

flight-hours in support of Coast Guard 
missions. 
I thank Officer Newberg for his serv-
ice to our country. I congratulate him 
on being named USO Coast Guardsman 
of the Year for 2019. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PHARMACIST DAY 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize National 
Pharmacist Day 2020, which was cele-
brated on January 12. 
According to Census data, there are 
over 200,000 pharmacists across the 
U.S., with another 25,000 pharmacy 
aides. Every day, these pharmacists are 
providing vaccines for a number of ill-
nesses and carefully counseling pa-
tients on prescriptions to help heal 
sickness and reduce pain. Through this 
work, pharmacists are considered one 
of the three most trusted professions in 
America. 
Today and throughout the rest of the 
year, I encourage everyone to visit 
their pharmacist, ask questions about 
their prescriptions, and get to know 
the people who provide their medicine 
and work to keep them healthy. 
As the only pharmacist currently 
serving in Congress, I am proud to rec-
ognize the work these individuals are 
doing every day to serve their local 
communities around the country.

b 1015 
A DAY OF RECKONING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes, 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Still I rise, Mr. 
Speaker, because I love my country 
and I love the people in this country. I 
love them because we are all created 
from a common Creator. I love the peo-
ple of this country. 
Not all of the people in the United 
States, those who are citizens, live 
within the continental United States. 
A good many of them live in Puerto 
Rico. I rise today to speak on behalf of 
the people of Puerto Rico who are suf-
fering because moneys that have been 
appropriated by the Congress of the 
United States of America have not 
been given to the people of Puerto Rico 
and have not been delivered to the peo-
ple of Puerto Rico. 
I cannot understand how Congress 
can appropriate—bills signed, money 
available—yet we cannot get it to the 
people who need it. I am told that hos-
pitals are closed. I am told that some 
people are sleeping in the street. I am 
told that there is suffering. I haven’t 
been there to see it myself, but the re-
ports are available for all of us. 
There is suffering taking place in 
Puerto Rico, and we in this House 
would allow what we have signed, 
sealed, not to be delivered? 
What is wrong with us? 
People are suffering. We can help. At 
some point we will have to pay for this, 
and we are not going to have to pay for 
it by losing a congressional office. That 
is easy. That is not the kind of punish-
ment we are going to get for the way 
we are treating people. There is going 
to be a day of reckoning for all of this, 
knowing that people are suffering and 
you withhold the money. 
The chief executive officer of this 
country knows what is going on, and 
we who are here in Congress are aware 
of what is being denied. All it takes is 
for the chief executive officer to send 
it, and it will be done. But it is not 
taking place. 
So I appear today, and I rise because 
I love my country. I love the people of 
Puerto Rico. They are Americans by 
the way, citizens by the way. I love 
them and I refuse to allow this to hap-
pen on my watch without my at least 
standing here and calling it to the at-
tention of the American public. 
I have a duty, a responsibility, and 
an obligation to say something about 
this type of behavior, especially when 
there are 435 of us who could do some-
thing about it and have done some-
thing about it, but there is one person 
who declines to allow justice to be 
done. 
Mr. President, what is wrong with 
you? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
f 
DE FACTO VETO SETS A 
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. KING) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my honor to be recognized and address 
you here on the floor of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
I come before you this morning to re-
mind this House and to speak about 
the procedure that is pending in the 
Senate and some activities that need 
to take place in this House before that 
is likely to happen, and that, of course, 
is the impeachment of the President of 
the United States. 
It took place December 18, and we 
will have been waiting nearly a month 
before the Articles of Impeachment 
would be transferred over to the United 
States Senate which would then begin 
the enactment of a trial—hopefully a 
fair trial—with an opportunity for the 
President to defend himself over in the 
United States Senate. 
I was here in this city for 3 days of 
the impeachment hearings before the 
House Judiciary Committee in 1998 and 
I was able to observe the activities 
here in this House and how people 
acted. I will say the people who were 
defending Bill Clinton were not serious 
outside the camera and in the House 
Judiciary Committee. 
Here we have an impeachment that 
has been brought forward on two dif-
ferent charges and we have watched as 
from the beginning, from clear back in 
November of 2016, this discussion about 
impeaching the President of the United 
States began. It began on November 9 
when the first Democrat stepped up 
and said: We are going to impeach this 
President. 
We had people who ran for office to 
get into this Congress who announced: 
We are going to impeach the—I can’t 
put those words into this CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, Mr. Speaker. 
So this has been a driven agenda and 
it began as soon as the other side real-
ized that Donald Trump was the duly 
elected and legitimate President of the 
United States. 
There are two reasons that this im-
peachment is taking place here. One of 
them is because there is a deep, vis-
ceral hatred for Donald Trump among 
the hardcore left in this country that 
is driving the caucus on that side. 
Another reason is because the inves-
tigations came about because of the 
weaponization of the executive branch 
of the United States. I mean particu-
larly the Department of Justice and 
within it the FBI, some of the State 
Department, and much of the intel-
ligence community working together 
to surveil President Trump’s campaign 
operations and then President-elect 
Donald Trump’s inauguration activi-
ties and communications before that 
and surveillance afterwards. 
Also I mean the circumstances that 
came about when James Comey took 
information that was proprietary and 
many say classified and leaked it to a 
professor of Columbia University with 
directions to leak it to The New York 
Times with the objective of creating a 
special counsel that needed to be Rob-
ert Mueller who couldn’t have been 
changed differently by then-Attorney 
General Jeff Sessions because he had 
recused himself from Russia. 
This is the backdrop of this. Im-
peachment puts a cloud up in front of 
the activities that took place that 
should appall this Nation at the high-
est level. 
So what I ask, Mr. Speaker, is this: 
Let’s get these Articles of Impeach-
ment done in this House this week, 
let’s send them down across the ro-
tunda to the United States Senate, and 
let’s ask the Senate then to go ahead 
and work your will under your rules. 
But my ask is this: having lived 
through this as a witness back in 1998, 
we didn’t get a clean verdict in the 
United States Senate. I am going from 
memory here, I didn’t look up these ar-
ticles and the actual vote, but I re-
member this: the public never knew 
from each Senator whether they be-
lieved 
that 
President 
Clinton 
was 
guilty of the various charges that were 
brought before him. All wrapped in one 
question was: If he is guilty, is he wor-
thy of being removed from office? 
When you package those things to-
gether and you had Democratic Sen-
ators defending Bill Clinton, they said: 
Well, I didn’t have to wonder if he was 
guilty because if he was, it didn’t rise 
to the level to remove him from office. 
I would like to know, I think the 
public wants to know, and I think it is

the constitutional duty of the United 
States Senate to give us a verdict: 
Did the President actually obstruct 
Congress? 
Did he actually abuse power? 
What were the definitions of those 
things? 
They are not crimes. 
What were the definitions? 
Let’s find out the judgment of these 
Senators, yes or no, guilty or not 
guilty, and then the next question is: 
Should he be removed from office? 
I say not. I didn’t see the evidence 
here. I don’t see any crimes, and there 
have been no crimes. 
All it amounts to also is in delaying 
these Articles of Impeachment if the 
Speaker can block a majority action 
from the House of Representatives, 
then the Speaker can block every ac-
tion from the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. It is not a sustainable po-
sition for the Speaker to refuse to mes-
sage and have a de facto veto because 
that would make the Speaker of the 
House all-powerful with a veto for any 
piece 
of 
action 
that 
would 
come 
through the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Let’s get this done this week, and I 
encourage the Senate to get it done 
quickly. I would like to see the Presi-
dent stand here before us at the State 
of the Union address February 4 and be 
able to announce to the world that he 
has been exonerated by the United

respect. 
May all that is done today be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF MAMIE 
KIRKLAND 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, last month Buffalo’s oldest 
resident, Mamie Kirkland, passed away 
at the age of 111. Mamie made Buffalo 
her home in 1923 after spending a life-
time 
outsmarting 
racism 
in 
Mis-
sissippi, Illinois, and Ohio. She fled ri-
oting, burning of homes, and the shoot-
ing of residents by an angry racist 
mob. She witnessed the Ku Klux Klan 
burn a cross on the lawn of her family 
home. 
Through these memories she inspired 
the creation of both the Legacy Mu-
seum and National Memorial for Peace 
and Justice. 
Four years ago Ms. Kirkland was 
honored at a gala by the Equal Justice 
Initiative. When asked to speak on her 
journey, she said: ‘‘I left Mississippi a 
scared little girl of 7 years old. Now I 
am 107—and I am not afraid anymore.’’ 
I rise to honor the fearless legacy of 
Ms. Kirkland for the citizens of Buf-
falo, a city honored to be Mamie’s 
home. 
IRAN PROTESTS 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, the amazing 
capabilities of our men and women in 
uniform, combined with decisive action 
by President Trump, inspired thou-
sands of civilians throughout Iran to 
take to the streets over the weekend to 
protest their government. These indi-
viduals braved the threat of live fire, 
teargas, and further damage to show 
the Ayatollah and his thugs that 
enough is enough. 
It is a shame that in sharp contrast, 
House Democrats last week buckled to 
the Iranian regime and passed a con-
current War Powers Resolution at-
tempting to tie the President’s hands 
and obstruct his already successful Ira-
nian 
strategy. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Speaker yesterday sadly attempted to 
downplay these nationwide protests as 
just 
‘‘students’’ 
upset 
about 
the 
downed airliner. 
To the protesters in Tehran, Shiraz, 
and elsewhere: I say the Speaker of 
this House does not speak for all of us. 
We do not downplay your courage, and 
we stand with you. 
f 
DRUG PRICING 
(Ms. JOHNSON of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
as a professional registered nurse in 
Congress, I must say how crucial it is 
for essential medications to be afford-
able and accessible. 
In 2017, 42 percent of Texas residents 
stopped taking medications as pre-
scribed simply due to cost according to 
AARP. Over 2.6 million Texans have di-
abetes, and they must have daily ac-
cess to affordable and quality insulin. 
Mr. Speaker, huge investments from 
taxpayers go into the development of 
quality medications, yet just in the 
first days of 2020 multiple pharma-
ceutical 
companies 
have 
increased 
prices on over 400 drugs by 5 percent of 
the taxpayers’ money. 
We must do more to protect the vul-
nerable members of our communities, 
especially our seniors and the unin-
sured. With support of this House and 
Senate, we must continue to work to-
gether to lower the cost of prescription 
drugs for our constituents. 
f 
ANTI-SEMITISM 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to condemn the increasing anti-Se-
mitic violence that has spread in re-
cent months, including the recent stab-
bing that happened last month in New 
York. 
Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitic and anti- 
Israel attitudes often emerge because

of a lack of understanding of the pain-
ful history directed at the Jewish peo-
ple and the horrors of the Holocaust. 
For this reason, I introduced H. Res. 
782 alongside Representatives ZELDIN 
and KUSTOFF that encourages public 
schools to design and teach a cur-
riculum about the history of anti-Sem-
itism and the Holocaust and it calls on 
Federal law enforcement to hold the 
perpetrators of these attacks account-
able. 
Our Jewish community is feeling rat-
tled, frightened, and unsafe. We cannot 
allow these feelings to fester. So in 
support of this community, I am proud 
to lead a resolution that will help in-
crease understanding and rid our coun-
try of all anti-Semitic hatred.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
UNITED 
WAY OF CENTRAL MASSACHU-
SETTS 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the United Way 
of Central Massachusetts as they cele-
brate their 100th birthday this month 
and to thank the incredible staff, in-
terns, fellows, volunteers, and commu-
nity partners who allow this amazing 
institution to make a difference for so 
many people. 
When I think of organizations that 
change lives, organizations that mobi-
lize and unite our community to in-
spire change and create a better world, 
organizations that look out for the 
least among us by giving families the 
tools and stability they need to break 
the cycle of poverty and get back on 
their feet, I think of the United Way of 
Central Massachusetts. 
I am so proud and grateful for the 
work they do every day and the posi-
tive impact they have on the folks I am 
privileged to represent. 
On behalf of my constituents and 
with thanks from the entire United 
States Congress, congratulations to 
the United Way of Central Massachu-
setts for a century of awe-inspiring 
work, and here is to many more.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRANK 
MITCHELL 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a trailblazer 
and Springfield, Illinois, native, Frank 
Mitchell, who on Christmas Day at age 
70, unfortunately passed away after a 
fight with lung cancer. 
In the spring of 1965 Frank made his-
tory right here in the House of Rep-
resentatives when he became the first 
African American page since Recon-
struction. Nominated by the late Con-
gressman 
Paul 
Findley, 
who 
rep-
resented what makes up much of the 
18th 
Congressional 
District 
today, 
Frank was appointed by then-House 
Republican leader and future Presi-
dent, Gerald Ford. 
As a page, Frank answered calls in 
the Republican Cloakroom, worked on 
the House floor, and witnessed many 
historic events, including the civil 
rights movement and the debate on the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
Frank’s historic appointment was 
long overdue, and he blazed a path for 
those who followed him with his work 
ethic and compassion for everyone he 
encountered. Frank often said that he 
couldn’t fail because the door of oppor-
tunity had to remain open. Frank suc-
ceeded in every respect, keeping that 
door of opportunity open for genera-
tions to come. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
the Mitchell family, and may Frank 
rest in peace.

SUPPORTING IRANIAN 
PROTESTERS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the people of Iran have taken 
to the streets in defiance of their op-
pressive regime and refuted the lies 
that Soleimani was a beloved general. 
Already 1,500 people have been killed 
while protesting the authoritarian re-
gime. 
The Epoch Times of January 7 is cor-
rect: ‘‘The protesters’ central demand 
in Iran is for the mullahs’ regime to 
step down, stop its terrorist adventures 
abroad, and end its massive corruption 
at home.’’ 
This is why I am cosponsoring H. 
Res. 791, introduced by Leader KEVIN 
MCCARTHY that supports the protesters 
of Iran. I am thankful for the coura-
geous leadership of President Donald 
Trump and his support for the Iranian 
people. 
He tweeted in Farsi: ‘‘To the brave, 
long-suffering people of Iran: I’ve stood 
with you since the beginning of my 
Presidency, and my administration 
will continue to stand with you. We are 
following your protests closely and are 
inspired by your courage.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

EARTHQUAKES IN PUERTO RICO 
AND SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCY 
DECLARATION 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.) 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise on be-
half of every single one of my constitu-
ents impacted by the ongoing seismic 
activity in Puerto Rico. 
According to the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, the southwestern coast of the is-
land has been the epicenter of over 
1,000 earthquakes since December 28 of 
last year. 
On January 7 the island experienced 
a 6.4 magnitude earthquake that has 
triggered consequent aftershock trem-
ors that are felt in the entire island, 
mainly 
in 
the 
municipalities 
of 
Guanica, Guayanilla, Yauco, Penuelas, 
and Ponce. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge President Trump 
to approve the major disaster declara-
tion requested by the Governor of 
Puerto Rico. This should be the next 
step to ensure proper and timely recov-
ery efforts on the island as we push 
through yet another natural disaster.

CONGRATULATING LOUISIANA 
STATE UNIVERSITY TIGERS 
(Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I am 
here to congratulate the LSU Fighting 
Tigers for winning the national cham-
pionship last night, the fourth national 
championship, a record-setting year, 
15–0, 726 points. Joe Burrow is the 
Heisman Trophy winner, a record- 
breaking quarterback with 60 touch-
downs this year. 
LSU alumni are especially proud of 
what they did last night in the na-
tional championship. 
I was honored to fly down with Presi-
dent Trump to attend the game. The 
cheers and standing ovation he got in 
the Louisiana Superdome was just phe-
nomenal and well deserved, the fifth 
time the President has been to Lou-
isiana this past year, and rightly so. 
Our State leads with seafood, oil and 
gas industry, forestry, and agriculture. 
You name it, we have got it in Lou-
isiana, and we are very, very proud. 
This football team, our baseball 
team, and our other sports lead the Na-
tion and will continue to do so. 
Please join me in congratulating the 
LSU Fighting Tigers football team for 
winning the national championship 
last night.

SUPPORT GRANDPARENTS IN 
PRIMARY CAREGIVER ROLES 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 5583, the Help Grandfamilies Pre-
vent Child Abuse Act. I am proud to co-
sponsor this legislation with my col-
league, 
Congresswoman 
MARY
GAY 
SCANLON of Pennsylvania’s Fifth Dis-
trict. 
All children deserve a loving and safe 
home. Sadly, due to the Nation’s grow-
ing opioid crisis, more and more chil-
dren are being left without structure, 
without safety, and, in some cases, 
without parents. As a result, grand-
parents have become the primary care-
givers for many children.

The 
Help 
Grandfamilies 
Prevent 
Child Abuse Act will provide resources 
to assist grandparents in raising their 
grandchildren and, most importantly, 
help prevent these children from enter-
ing the foster care system. 
This bill ensures grandfamilies and 
kinship caregivers are eligible for serv-
ices under the Child Abuse Prevention 
and Treatment Act, or CAPTA. It also 
provides support to meet the needs of 
children who have experienced trauma; 
for example, those exposed to sub-
stance misuse. Lastly, the bill calls for 
training and resources to assist care-
givers in navigating the complicated 
childcare system. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5583 is a good bill. 
It is a bipartisan bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 790, 
providing for consideration of two 
measures: H.R. 1230, the Protecting 
Older Workers Against Discrimination 
Act, and H.J. Res. 76, providing for con-
gressional disapproval under chapter 8 
of title 5, United States Code, of the 
rule submitted by the Department of 
Education relating to ‘‘Borrower De-
fense Institutional Accountability.’’ 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 1230 under a structured rule, with 
1 hour of debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. It makes in order 
five amendments and provides one mo-
tion to recommit. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.J. Res. 76 under a closed rule, with 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and the ranking 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, and it provides one 
motion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides for stand-
ard district work period instructions 
from January 17 through January 24, 
2020. 
Mr. Speaker, since taking the major-
ity a year ago, Democrats have made it 
a priority to protect our Nation’s stu-
dents and workers. As a member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor, I 
am proud that I have played a role in 
passing legislation that will provide 
students and workers the support they 
need to thrive. We have that oppor-
tunity once again this week with these 
bills, both of which I am proud to co-
sponsor. 
First, we are taking a stand against 
the Department of Education’s delib-
erate disregard for students who have 
been defrauded by institutions. In 2019, 
student loan debt reached an all-time 
high in the United States of $1.41 tril-
lion. Our Nation is truly in a student 
debt crisis. 
Even more significantly impacted by 
this crisis are students who have been 
defrauded by predatory for-profit col-
leges. On top of their crushing debt, 
they have useless degrees and none of

the job opportunities that they were 
promised. 
In 2016, following the collapse of two 
major predatory for-profit institutions, 
President Obama established the bor-
rower defense rule to help students ac-
cess relief from their student loans. In-
stead of helping students, Secretary 
DeVos modified the rule, creating an 
intentionally complicated process that 
restricts how much relief defrauded 
students can receive. 
According to The Institute for Col-
lege Access and Success, the new rule 
would forgive only about 3 cents on 
every dollar borrowed. Even in cases 
where schools clearly violate the law, 
this new rule denies students relief if 
they can’t prove the school inten-
tionally defrauded them, can’t file 
their claim fast enough, or can’t docu-
ment exactly how much financial harm 
they have suffered due to fraud. 
Although we don’t have the full pic-
ture because their investments are 
shrouded in secrecy, Secretary DeVos’ 
connections to the for-profit college in-
dustry led me to believe that her siding 
with the industry is not a coincidence. 
The bill we will consider this week 
would bring us back to the Obama-era 
rules that put students first and profit 
second. 
Second, we will bring to the floor the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act. One in four adults age 
65 and older are part of the workforce, 
and that number is still growing. While 
some of the reasons behind this shift in 
the labor force are positive, like better 
health and job satisfaction, many older 
Americans must keep working because 
they are not financially prepared for 
retirement. 
Sadly, aging American adults have a 
median savings of just over $150,000 for 
retirement. If a person is fortunate 
enough to live a long, healthy life and 
has 30 years of retirement, that would 
leave them with just $5,000 a year, a 
sum no one could retire on anywhere in 
this country. 
Unfortunately, older workers suffer 
disproportionately from long-term un-
employment and age discrimination in 
the workforce. Six out of 10 older work-
ers have experienced age discrimina-
tion, but a 2009 Supreme Court ruling 
has made it harder for them to prove 
it. The decision upended decades of 
precedent, making it more difficult for 
older workers to get justice through 
the courts. 
This legislation restores workplace 
protections for older Americans, pav-
ing the way for a more inclusive and 
diverse workforce. 
Taken together, these bills honor our 
commitment to students and workers 
and offer us the opportunity to reverse 
two misguided and harmful policies. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
DESAULNIER) for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides 
for consideration of two measures, a 
bill that seeks to protect older Ameri-
cans from discrimination in the work-
place and a Congressional Review Act 
resolution to overturn a Department of 
Education rule on borrower defense to 
repayment. While both pieces of legis-
lation appear to protect vulnerable 
Americans, they likely have no chance 
of becoming law. 
First, H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act, 
adds a section to the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act that shifts the 
burden of proof in age discrimination 
cases to allow a plaintiff to show that 
any practice by the employer for which 
age may be an involved factor, not the 
sole factor, is covered by the act. 
b 1230 
This changes congressional intent 
and disregards case law. 
In 1967, Congress enacted the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act to 
protect applicants and employees over 
40 years of age from discrimination on 
the basis of age in employment mat-
ters. It is enforced by the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission. 
In 2009, the Supreme Court held that, 
in the case of Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services, Inc., the standard of proof for 
a claim under the Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act requires that age 
stand alone as the cause of the adverse 
employment action rather than in con-
junction with other factors. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court also ruled 
in the University of Texas South-
western Medical Center v. Dr. Naiel 
Nassar that the plaintiff must prove 
that a retaliatory motive was the deci-
sive cause of adverse employment ac-
tion. 
H.R. 1230 would reverse these Su-
preme Court decisions by allowing 
mixed-motive claims in Age Discrimi-
nation in Employment Act cases, clari-
fying that age need only be a moti-
vating factor for discrimination, even 
though other factors also motivated 
the action unfavorable to the em-
ployee. This would actually make it 
more difficult to prove discrimination 
because an employer would simply 
have to show that they would have 
taken the same action in the absence 
of age as a motivating factor, which 
will be more easy to show under the 
mixed-motive legal framework. 
Congress previously rejected amend-
ments to add age discrimination to the 
Civil Rights Act, resulting in the pas-
sage of the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act using a different legal 
procedure. 
Lowering 
the 
standard 
would apply the legal procedure of the 
Civil Rights Act to the Age Discrimi-
nation in Employment Act. In addi-
tion, a lower standard is likely to lead 
to increased litigation that, in fact, 
only benefits the plaintiffs’ bar. 
Other provisions of H.R. 1230 prohibit 
a court from awarding damages or re-
quiring any employment activity other 
than injunctive relief. This means that 
discriminated parties are precluded 
from actually receiving monetary re-
lief, and the only true beneficiaries of 
this law will be trial lawyers. 
The Supreme Court stated in the 
Nassar case that ‘‘lessening the causa-
tion standard could . . . contribute to 
the filing of frivolous claims, which 
would siphon resources from efforts by 
employers, 
administrative 
agencies, 
and courts to combat workplace har-
assment.’’ 
Republicans are committed to elimi-
nating discrimination in the work-
place, including for older Americans. 
Discrimination of any kind is already 
against the law. 
Let me rephrase that. Discrimination 
of any kind is already against the law 
through the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act, the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, 
and the Civil Rights Act. 
Now, the second measure included in 
this rule is the Congressional Review 
Act resolution to overturn a 2019 De-
partment of Education rule called Bor-
rower Defense Institutional Account-
ability. 
In 1994, the Department of Education 
issued the Borrower Defense to Repay-
ment regulation. In 2015, the Depart-
ment of Education began considering 
borrower defense claims prior to de-
fault 
or 
collection 
proceedings, 
prompting a significant increase in ap-
plications for loan relief. 
On November 1, 2016, the Department 
of Education published a Borrower De-
fense to Repayment regulation that did 
not distinguish between intentional 
fraud and a simple mistake by an insti-
tution of higher education. These regu-
lations went after institutions rather 
than working to help students. Offend-
ing institutions suffered significant fi-
nancial penalties, resulting in a tax-
payer cost of $42 billion and the loss of 
access to higher education for millions 
of students. 
These Obama administration regula-
tions were, in fact, overly broad, with 
the intent of loan forgiveness, despite 
taxpayer cost. 
The Trump administration’s Depart-
ment of Education subsequently issued 
a notice of proposed rulemaking and 
reviewed over 30,000 comments prior to 
publishing a final rule in September of 
2019 to revise these 2016 regulations. 
And let me just remind you, these 
2016 regulations actually came about 
right at the end of the previous admin-
istration. The 2019 regulations, those 
that were derived after the 30,000 com-
ments, the 2019 regulations will apply 
only to loans disbursed after July 1, 
2020. So existing loans will remain sub-
ject to the 1994 or the 2016 rules, de-
pending upon the issue date. 
The new regulations will provide loan 
relief to those students who have been 
lied to and suffered financial harm. 
They will also hold institutions ac-
countable, grant due process to all par-
ties, allow for the use of arbitration, 
and expand the closed school look-back 
period from 120 to 180 days.

If this rule is not allowed to take ef-
fect, the 2016 regulations will remain. 
The definition of misrepresentation 
under the 2016 regulation is so broad 
that nearly everyone will eventually 
receive loan forgiveness, so this may, 
in fact, have the effect of making col-
lege free. 
Now, free college sounds like a great 
benefit to society, but it is not prac-
tical, and it would force those who 
can’t or won’t go to college to pay for 
those who do. 
In addition, eliminating the cost to 
higher education will limit the com-
petitiveness of institutions, reducing 
the superiority of American colleges 
and universities. 
Now, we heard last night in the Rules 
Committee that this Congressional Re-
view Act is important to combat for- 
profit colleges, but the rules apply to 
all institutions. This means that even 
those institutions that inadvertently 
make a mistake, such as not updating 
a graduation rate on a flyer, will suffer 
financial penalties and, in fact, may 
have to close, despite no intentional 
wrongdoing. 
The 2019 borrower defense rule is a 
significant improvement over the 2016 
regulations and will save the taxpayer 
money, ensure due process, and hold 
fraudulent higher education institu-
tions accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I want to thank Congresswoman 
SUSIE LEE and Chairman BOBBY SCOTT 
for their leadership on advocating for 
America’s students. 
In the economy that we are in today, 
some kind of postsecondary training, 
whether it is an associate’s degree, an 
apprenticeship program, or a 4-year 
program, is necessary in order to get 
the skills that are required in order to 
support a family and earn a decent liv-
ing, and that is what education should 
be about in this country. 
Sadly, in order to get that education, 
too many young people and people 
transitioning into their next job are 
taking on mountains of debt. Student 
debt is now $1.3 trillion, more than 
credit card debt in this country. 
As a result, these students, these 
graduates, often, or some who drop out 
are holding back from making other 
necessary investments to support their 
families, holding back on buying a 
home, and holding back on starting 
families and putting away money for 
their retirement because they are so 
saddled with debt. 
One of the contributors to this huge 
increase in student debt has been the 
effect of predatory for-profit colleges. 
They have exploited potential students 
with false promises of high-paying jobs; 
and, particularly shameful, they have 
recruited the most vulnerable low-in-
come individuals: first-generation stu-
dents, veterans. They have recruited 
them into junk programs. 
Education should always be a vehicle 
to opportunity. Instead, these students 
are left with a bag of promises and 
crushing student debt. 
This is a real problem. This a real 
issue. That is why President Obama’s 
Department of Education enacted the 
borrower defense rule to outline a 
clear, transparent process for student 
loan relief and to institute protections 
for those students and protections for 
taxpayers as well, because we are often 
talking about taxpayer-backed loans. 
The 
Obama 
borrower 
defense 
rule 
would help defrauded students get the 
loan debt relief that is owed to them 
under the law. 
Secretary DeVos, however, has re-
fused to implement this rule, and as of 
December 2019, 240,000 defrauded bor-
rowers are still waiting for her to act 
on their claims. That includes 6,000 
people from my home State. This rule 
further 
underscores 
why 
Secretary 
DeVos is unsuited for this position. 
We have to protect students from 
these for-profit colleges that have de-
frauded them, and I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
rule and the legislation that will be 
coming to the floor. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Soon we will vote on the previous 
question, and if we defeat the previous 
question, I will offer an amendment to 
the rule to require the House to imme-
diately proceed to consideration of H. 
Res. 791, a resolution supporting the 
protestors in Iran. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of this amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the Republican 
leader, to explain the amendment. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the 
world saw powerful images coming out 
of Tehran. Iranian protestors, many of 
them students, braved gas and gunfire 
to gather in the streets and speak out 
against their oppressive government 
for lying to its people. We saw video 
footage of people putting their personal 
safety at risk so their fellow citizens 
and the countries of the world could 
know the truth about what was going 
on inside Iran. 
The Iranian protesters are showing 
incredible courage, standing up to a 
government that kills and brutally si-
lences its own people. To get a sense of 
how brave their actions are, think 
about this: When Iranians took to the 
streets to protest late last year, many 
of them were shot and killed by their 
own country’s security forces. Death 
tolls show Iran’s Government killed 
1,500 people during the 2-month dem-
onstration. 
According to experts, this is the 
bloodiest 
crackdown 
on 
protestors 
since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. It 
came after the Supreme Leader of Iran 
gave a chilling order to ‘‘do whatever it 
takes to end it.’’ 
Sadly, attacks on innocent civilians 
have been all too common in Iran. This 
is just another horrifying chapter in 
their long history of harming their own 
citizens. 
What is happening in Iran is a re-
minder that here in the United States 
there should never be any hesitation to 
stand with people in their calls for 
freedom. From the beginning, America 
has been a shining beacon of hope for 
those seeking a free society. Our task 
is to embrace that identity and the re-
sponsibility that comes with it. 
Especially now, we cannot shrink 
from the sources of our national great-
ness. That is why I stand here today: to 
ask you to lend freedom your voice and 
unconditional support. 
The resolution I introduced yester-
day accomplishes three things: 
It condemns the Government of Iran 
for 
shooting 
down 
Ukraine 
Inter-
national Airlines flight 752, which 
killed 172 innocent civilians; 
It expresses unequivocal support for 
the Iranian protesters; and 
It calls on the Iranian regime to not 
use force against its own people, as it 
has done so many times before. 
This resolution sends a strong mes-
sage that the United States stands 
with the Iranian people and we are 
with them in their demands for free 
and honest government. 
But the resolution also intends to 
amplify 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
Iranian 
protestors. It does not call for any-
thing Iranians have not already de-
manded themselves. 
This is an issue on which Congress 
should and must speak with one voice. 
We already passed similar measures 
supporting Hong Kong protesters by 
substantial 
bipartisan 
margins. 
It 
should not be difficult for us to pass 
this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been thinking a 
lot about what the Iranian protests 
mean today and in the future, and two 
things come to mind: a story and a 
quote. 
b 1245 
The story is a small one. It happened 
a couple days ago at a university in 
Tehran. It is about a group of students 
and two big flags. 
The Iranian Government had painted 
large American and Israeli flags in the 
middle of the street, as a sign of dis-
respect expecting people to walk over 
them. But a group of Iranian students 
courageously defied the regime’s wish-
es. They would not walk on the flag 
and booed those who did. Some re-
ported that the students were chanting 
‘‘our enemy is in Iran, not America.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H219 
January 14, 2020 
There are moments in time of history 
that the craving for freedom gets dis-
played, be it a young, lone man stand-
ing in front of tanks in Tiananmen 
Square, or be it some students in 
Tehran with fear just a few months be-
fore of being murdered, but not willing 
to walk on the American flag. A small 
moment with big meaning, for the stu-
dents, for Iran and for us. It reminds 
me of the Hong Kong protestors who 
waved American flags and sang our na-
tional anthem. 
The quote I have been thinking of 
comes from an anthology of speeches 
that Frederick Douglass read as a 
young man. The quote is this, ‘‘Let it 
be remembered, there is no luxury so 
exquisite as the exercise of humanity, 
and no post so honorable as his, who 
defends the rights of man.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, America is more than a 
country. We are an idea, an inspiration 
for those who yearn to be free and have 
the ability and dignity to determine 
their own destiny. 
So many times in this body as these 
moments rose around the world, be it 
the shipyard workers of Poland, be it 
the craving of the Berlin Wall col-
lapsing and becoming one, be it those 
in Hong Kong that want just freedom 
of speech. 
Let us not be the Congress that 
misses the opportunity. Let us not be 
the Congress that takes 1 week earlier 
and sends a message to the Iran Gov-
ernment that is much different, that 
we are divided, that we would not 
stand up if they murdered their own 
people again, or we would not stand up 
if those who are young students who 
rose and would not walk across an 
American flag and booed those who 
would, those who would stand up in 
Iran and say ‘‘the enemy is in Iran, not 
in America.’’ Let us not be that Con-
gress. 
Let us take this moment in time 
where history has shown that we are 
right when we stand with anyone who 
craves freedom. This resolution is the 
right way to amplify the call for free-
dom in Iran. 
It is not just those on C–SPAN who 
are watching, it is the world who is 
watching. The world is much smaller 
today than at those other times. We 
will not have to wait for days or hours 
for the news to come across. It will be 
in a tweet, it will be in a text, or it will 
be in an Instagram. 
There are important issues in this 
Nation, but there are none more impor-
tant than whether we stand for free-
dom. I do not want this Congress to 
walk in shame that they missed this 
window. I do not want historians to 
look back in a few decades and see ci-
vilians were killed because they stood 
for freedom and America stood quiet. 
That is why I am asking that we vote 
‘‘no’’ on this PQ. This resolution de-
serves to be heard, but more impor-
tantly, the world deserves to hear this 
Congress act. 
Do you agree that America is more 
than a country; that America is an 
idea, that it could be so great of an in-
spiration, it would move the students 
to crave what we fought for? Let’s take 
this moment in time to tell them we 
hear them, we stand with them, and 
this America will always defend free-
dom here and around the world. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to respond to the comments from 
my friend from California. 
We know the Government of Iran ad-
mitted to mistakenly shooting down 
the 
Ukraine 
International 
Airlines 
flight. It was a tragedy, and tragedies 
led to tragedy. The people of Iran stood 
up and demanded accountability and 
are standing up from their government 
today. 
This Congress supports those who 
have stood up to their government de-
manding transparency and fighting for 
their rights. That is why the concur-
rent resolution we passed last week re-
affirmed that it is in our national in-
terest to support the people of Iran and 
other Middle Eastern countries who de-
mand an end to government corruption 
in violation of basic human rights. 
As of this morning, the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee is holding a hearing to 
examine our policy with Iran. While 
the Foreign Affairs Committee is hear-
ing from experts on Iran, the House is 
taking action to protect students and 
protect Americans from discrimination 
in the workplace, and that is what this 
rule is about. 
Make no mistake, defeating the pre-
vious question is not a vote on the 
McCarthy resolution, it is a vote to 
hand over control of the House floor to 
the minority. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on the previous question so we may 
proceed to these critical pieces of legis-
lation without delay. 
I might add, just on a personal note, 
I would ask my colleagues to help—and 
I am sure they have had some cases of 
this—the Iranian Americans who have 
come to my office in my district with 
very troubling stories about their rel-
atives who regularly have come to visit 
them in this country who are unable to 
come right now because of the travel 
ban by this administration. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN), a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
been a professor of constitutional law 
for 29 years, so I know the relationship 
between universities and students is 
sacred. We pledge to teach young peo-
ple everything we know in order to pro-
pel them to become engaged citizens, 
educated human beings, and effective 
actors in the economy and society. 
When I hear about for-profit colleges 
and universities ripping off young peo-
ple and their families and plunging 
them into debt for unconscionable get- 
rich-quick schemes, it infuriates me as 
a professor, as a father, and as a Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives 
representing the people of Maryland. 
These rip-off institutions like Corin-
thian Colleges and ITT Technical Insti-
tute, which collapsed last year, leaves 
students with crushing debt, degrees 
that are not worth the paper they are 
printed on, and broken promises for the 
future. 
The Obama administration adopted 
the borrower defense rule to authorize 
the Department of Education to pro-
vide debt relief to student borrowers 
who have been defrauded by these pred-
atory, low-rent higher ed rip-off acad-
emies. 
In Maryland, we have 3,754 students 
waiting for the Department of Edu-
cation to review their borrower defense 
claims and relieve them of millions of 
dollars in loans that the American gov-
ernment disbursed to predatory col-
leges. Secretary Betsy DeVos, who is to 
education what Attorney General Barr 
is to justice, is not only keeping the 
Department of Education from proc-
essing 
240,000 
defrauded 
borrower 
claims nationwide, but she has drafted 
a new rule to make it nearly impos-
sible for students to obtain relief from 
fraudulent colleges as of June 2020. 
Secretary DeVos wants to replace a 
system of higher ed with a new system 
of higher debt. Under the old rule, 
groups of students defrauded by a pred-
atory college would have received an 
automatic loan discharge of the debt 
from the rip-off institution. Under the 
new rule, defrauded students would 
have to submit individualized evidence 
to the satisfaction of the department 
that rip-off colleges intentionally mis-
represented degree program outcomes, 
quality of instruction, or job place-
ment opportunities. So even where 
these Bonnie-and-Clyde schools clearly 
violated the law en masse, students can 
still be denied relief if they can’t prove 
that they were individually and inten-
tionally deceived, if they can’t file 
their claim fast enough, or if they 
can’t document how much financial 
harm they have personally suffered. 
Billionaire Secretary DeVos, the pa-
tron saint of the rip-off academies, is 
basically telling working class kids 
across America that life isn’t fair, and 
now she is making that the law. Most 
victims of the higher debt industry will 
never fully recover from the lost time 
and opportunity, but by allowing these 
miseducation hucksters to rip them 
off, we are implicated as a Nation, and 
we must not fail them again. We must 
fully forgive every penny that the stu-
dents were taken on a ride for. We 
must overrule the DeVos rule. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for yielding. I appreciate this 
time to speak on behalf of my congres-
sional district, which I lovingly call 
the ‘‘13th District Strong.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, instead of working on 
behalf of students, Secretary DeVos is 
enriching predatory for-profit colleges 
that leave students with crushing debt

and useless degrees, and I rise today 
because we have to stop it. 
If you want to see harm caused by 
the legacy of the DeVos-led policies, 
look no further than my district. In 
fact, students in Michigan will suffer 
for years to come because of Secretary 
DeVos’ consistent record of putting 
for-profit interests first. And who are 
Secretary DeVos’ latest targets, stu-
dent borrowers who were defrauded by 
large for-profit colleges. Scams, Mr. 
Speaker. 
I heard from one constituent in my 
district who was deceived by a for-prof-
it college that suddenly, with no notice 
closed its doors 6 months into her 1- 
year program. Now she is burdened 
with thousands of dollars in loans and 
nothing to show for them, not even a 
certificate or a diploma. She did apply 
for the forgiveness program through 
the Department of Education but was 
denied. 
If we don’t stop this latest DeVos 
rule, we will guarantee that my con-
stituent will bear the burden of un-
fairly paying for a diploma she has 
never received. 
It is outrageous that our residents 
are the ones being punished instead of 
protected from this type of fraud and 
abuse. Sometimes I think these words 
‘‘fraud and abuse’’ are just not strong 
enough. These are scams, criminal ac-
tivity by these corporations coming in 
and targeting communities like mine 
that the majority are people of color. 
Look at the advertisement, they are 
targeting specific communities where I 
have a number of single mothers who 
want to go back to school and better 
their lives or other folks who are non-
traditional students are who they tar-
get. Again, these are the most vulner-
able communities that we all rep-
resent. 
We need to stop Secretary DeVos 
from this relentless effort to protect 
the bottom line for corporations at the 
expense of our residents, the students. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. KING). 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding. 
I rise in opposition to this rule and 
primarily in opposition to H.R. 1230, 
that is one of the subjects of this com-
bined rule that we have. 
The legislation that is coming before, 
the Protecting Older Workers Against 
Discrimination Act, reaches way too 
far. I am one of the people in this Con-
gress that has met payroll clear back 
to 1975. I haven’t kept track of all the 
people we hired, but we hired them 
across the full range that we had the 
opportunity of their age, whether it 
was on the young side or whether they 
stopped showing up on the other side. 
We want people that can do the job, 
and we want to take good care of those 
folks. We want to build a reputation 
that we are a good place to work. I 
want to have all of those workers come 
together at the Christmas party and 
join together like family, and that is 
what happened just this past week with 
King Construction. 
I think about what the impact of this 
proposed legislation does, and it works 
in the reverse of what many of the pro-
ponents would like to have it do. Cer-
tainly, when you take the definition of 
age discrimination and you expand it 
to mean if it is only the preponderance 
of the evidence—what we have in cur-
rent law is a preponderance of evidence 
and the but-for language. 
In other words, if an employee al-
leges they have been discriminated 
against because of age, there could be 
multiple other factors that were in-
volved in that decision. Yet, as long as 
age is a component and it could be as-
serted effectively that that age was a 
but-for component, then that would be 
satisfactory as far as the legislation is 
concerned. 
I think what happens instead is em-
ployers make prudent decisions, and 
when they do the hire, they are going 
to think, I have this applicant before 
me that is 62 years old. Picking an age, 
it could be 72 or 75 or less. That em-
ployer is going to have to make the 
calculation, what if this person is just 
setting me up? Or what if this person 
can’t do the job and I have to remove 
them or terminate them? You are set-
ting yourself up as an employer for po-
tential liability, and that decision gets 
made at the hiring end, which means 
there will be a lot of seniors that don’t 
have an opportunity to work because of 
the concern about the litigation that 
could be brought forward. 
We have protection now, Mr. Speak-
er, in law and in state law, and that is 
where it needs to stay. It is a problem 
that doesn’t exist and doesn’t need to 
be solved. 
b 1300 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the 
gentleman from Connecticut, I want to 
mention, like the previous speaker, I 
am a Member of this House who made 
payrolls for over 35 years in the res-
taurant business. I have a different per-
spective. 
I wanted to hire the most talented 
person in front of me, and I wanted my 
managers to do the same thing. I don’t 
think this rule, these kinds of laws, 
will inhibit that. 
I understand the intuitive perspec-
tive, but if you believe in hiring the 
best person, I don’t think you have to 
be afraid of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mr. 
COURTNEY). 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Rules Committee’s 
motion and passage of the underlying 
bill, H.J. Res. 76, which will block Sec-
retary Betsy DeVos’ antistudent bor-
rower defense rule. 
Over the last 5 years, for-profit col-
lege chains have, without warning, 
closed their doors on enrolled students 
who had paid their tuition—Corinthian 
College, ITT Tech, Dream Center, and 
Education Management Corporation— 
as have smaller schools like Ridley- 
Lowell in New London, Connecticut, 
which shut its doors midterm without 
notice on a school day 2 years ago. 
In 1993, Congress created the bor-
rower defense rule through the Higher 
Education Act to relieve student loan 
debt for student victims of fraud. Now, 
we have a Secretary of Education who 
wants to gut that law by making stu-
dents whose classes, diplomas, and cer-
tificates have been terminated have to 
jump through a ridiculous maze of 
hoops before they can get what Con-
gress intended back in 1993 and what 
the Obama administration was actu-
ally implementing—namely, justice—a 
complete discharge of student loan 
debt on the basis that students were 
victims of fraud. 
The convoluted explanation that the 
DeVos Department used to deny dis-
charge is a smokescreen for the admin-
istration’s blatant bias in favor of for- 
profit colleges. 
One group that sees the harm that 
the Education Department will do with 
the new rule is, surprisingly to some, 
The American Legion, America’s oldest 
and largest veterans organization. As 
the National Commander stated re-
cently, thousands of student veterans 
have been targeted and defrauded over 
the years by some of these rip-offs and 
have lost precious GI Bill benefits as a 
result. 
As the commander states: ‘‘The rule, 
as currently written, is fundamentally 
rigged against defrauded borrowers of 
student loans, depriving them of the 
opportunity for debt relief that Con-
gress intended to afford them under the 
Higher Education Act.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this Chamber should 
heed The American Legion, stand up 
for student veterans and all students, 
and vote for H.J. Res. 76. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. SHALALA), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, the 2016 
borrower defense rule created a process 
for student loan borrowers to dem-
onstrate that their loans did not need 
to be repaid due to their school’s mis-
leading, fraudulent, or otherwise ille-
gal conduct. 
Many of those that closed their doors 
left thousands of students with no 
credible recourse. Instead of working 
to protect students and taxpayers, 
however, the Education Secretary and 
the Department have repeatedly sided 
with these bad actors. 
By rewriting the borrower defense 
rule to favor those institutions, the 
Secretary has made it harder for bor-
rowers to get relief and shifted the cost 
of providing debt relief from the 
schools to the taxpayer.

Several independent reports have 
concluded that this rewrite is fun-
damentally rigged against defrauded 
borrowers, depriving them of the op-
portunity for assistance promised them 
under the Higher Education Act. Ac-
cording to an analysis based on the De-
partment’s data, the changes to the fi-
nancial triggers in the 2019 rule will re-
sult in institutions repaying only 1 per-
cent of the eligible loan debt. 
Mr. Speaker, I have led three institu-
tions of higher education. The Sec-
retary 
has 
created 
a 
bureaucratic 
nightmare. Even I, after reading the 
regulation carefully, could not figure 
out all the information that was nec-
essary to apply for relief. 
The Federal Government should be 
putting students and taxpayers first 
rather than helping financially irre-
sponsible schools stay afloat. 
Mr. Speaker, nearly 20,000 students in 
my State are currently seeking relief 
because they were cheated by preda-
tory colleges. I did not come to Con-
gress to protect corporations that seek 
to take advantage of low-income stu-
dents, veterans, and taxpayers. 
Until we take a definitive stance on 
for-profit schools, they will continue to 
defraud students. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire of the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. DESAULNIER) how many 
more speakers he has. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
have one more speaker. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a September 3 In-
stitute for College Access and Success 
article titled ‘‘Defrauded Students Left 
Holding the Bag Until Final ‘Borrower 
Defense’ Rule.’’ 
[From The Institute for College Access & 
Success, Sept. 3, 2019] 
DEFRAUDED STUDENTS LEFT HOLDING THE BAG 
UNDER FINAL ‘‘BORROWER DEFENSE’’ RULE 
Claiming to protect students and hold col-
leges accountable, on Friday the Department 
of Education finalized its so-called borrower 
defense rule. The rule allows students to 
seek to cancel student loans connected to 
fraud and other illegal activity by their col-
leges. ‘‘If a school defrauds students, it must 
be held accountable,’’ said Secretary of Edu-
cation Betsy DeVos in the press release. 
Yet the Trump Administration’s proposal 
would do virtually nothing to hold schools 
accountable for their misdeeds or to protect 
students who were wronged. To really under-
stand the impact of the rule, you have look 
at page 669 of the notice where—in a table ti-
tled ‘‘Assumptions for Main Budget Estimate 
Compared to PB2020 Baseline’’—the Depart-
ment published its own estimates of the like-
ly impact of the rule: 
Borrowers will be required to repay the 
vast majority of loans resulting from col-
leges’ wrongdoing. Only about 3 cents of 
every dollar borrowed will be forgiven under 
the borrower defense rule. 
Colleges, on the other hand, will rarely 
face any questions. They will repay only 
about a penny for every dollar of loans stem-
ming from misconduct. 
The 
Department 
expects 
substantial 
amounts of illegal activity by colleges. In 
2021 alone, the Department expects nearly 
200,000 borrowers to suffer from colleges’ ille-
gal conduct, but their rule would leave bor-
rowers to repay 97 percent of the resulting 
$2.5 billion in debt.

Methodology: Figures derived from U.S.

Education, ‘‘U.S. Department of Education

Borrowers, Hold Higher Education Institu-
tions Accountable and Save Taxpayers $11.1

Table 3 provides the data by sector, we used 
other Department data on loan volume by 
sector to produce a weighted average, on the 
assumption that these figures are consistent 
over time. U.S. Department of Education, 
‘‘Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Proposal,’’ March 
11, 2019, page Q–30, https://bit.ly/21XI7Xm. To 
translate these percentages into the number 
of affected students, we used other Depart-
ment data on the number of students bor-
rowing federal loans, again assuming that 
these figures are similar from year to year. 
Federal Student Aid Data Center, ‘‘Aid Re-
cipients Summary,’’ April 2019, https://bit.ly/ 
l2MGL5wc. To translate these percentages 
into dollar terms, we used projected loan vol-
ume in year 2021 from the Congressional 
Budget Office. Congressional Budget Office, 
‘‘Student Loan Programs—CBO’s May 2019 
Baseline,’’ May 2019, https://bit.ly/21A5juo. 
We examined fiscal year 2021, the first full 
year of the rule’s implementation. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, ac-
cording to the Institute for College Ac-
cess & Success, the DeVos rule would 
forgive just 3 cents of every dollar bor-
rowed by students. That means those 
scammed by bad actors and fly-by- 
night institutions would be forced to 
repay the vast majority of their loans 
for degrees they didn’t get, often 
through no fault of their own. 
We need to help defrauded borrowers, 
not defend for-profit colleges. That is 
what this resolution is all about. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.J. Res. 76 because we can 
no longer allow the denial of debt relief 
to students defrauded by predatory col-
leges. 
We can no longer allow a system that 
looks to line the pockets of the failed 
for-profits at the expense of students. 
We can no longer allow Secretary 
DeVos to ignore a court order as she 
attempts to turn over every action of 
the previous administration at the ex-
pense of the American taxpayer and 
the American public. 
People have been defrauded; people 
have been robbed; and we need justice. 
Nearly 8,000 Michigan borrowers are 
waiting for relief from paying their 
Federal student loans, including Erica 
Maupin, who was going to school to be-
come a paralegal until she was de-
frauded by a Corinthian College. Erica 
had to abandon her dream, and now she 
doesn’t know how she is going to pro-
vide for her family and pay off her debt 
because the Federal Government isn’t 
keeping its promise. 
I am glad that the House is taking 
this step today. We should all be proud 
that the House is taking this action. 
However, we should also recognize it 
comes at the expense of a great step 
backward of the current administra-
tion. 
Because of the step backward that 
they took, we now have to take an-
other two big steps forward to right 
this wrong and to bring justice to peo-
ple like Erica, to people like the 
Michiganders who are waiting for their 
justice are are waiting for their debt 
relief, and for our For the People Agen-
da. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the underlying meas-
ures do not protect vulnerable Ameri-
cans as intended. 
H.R. 1230 would make it more dif-
ficult to prove age as a motivating fac-
tor in adverse employment actions. Re-
publicans remain committed to elimi-
nating all forms of discrimination and 
ensuring a productive and competitive 
workforce, but this bill ignores Su-
preme Court decisions and will place 
opportunities in the hands of trial law-
yers rather than hardworking Ameri-
cans. 
H.J. Res. 76 is simply another par-
tisan attempt to deny President Trump 
any success, even if it means harming 
American students. 
Mr. Speaker, I remember when Presi-
dent Bush signed a Congressional Re-
view Act overturning some of the ergo-
nomic rules that the Clinton adminis-
tration issued literally days before 
that President left office. 
At the time, I ran a medical practice. 
I was a business owner wondering how 
I was going to pay for and comply with 
these new rules that seemed burden-
some, complicated, and confusing. The 
repeal of these rules relieved what was 
sure to be a heavy burden on my shoul-
ders and, certainly, many other small 
businesses. 
Congressional Review Act resolutions 
have consequences, and we should fully 
evaluate the effect that they will have 
on Americans rather than just play 
politics. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question, a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the rule, and a ‘‘no’’ vote on the under-
lying measures. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, these two issues are ex-
tremely important to the American 
public. 
When I think of the comments from 
my friend from Iowa and the comments 
about having made a payroll, I reflect 
on my career making those obliga-
tions. He neglected to say that doing

what he suggested employers would do 
is discriminatory on its face. 
I knew that when I instructed my 
managers and when I interviewed pro-
spective employees, I was not to dis-
criminate based on certain Federal and 
State categories. So by taking the lead 
that he assumed that some employers 
might do, that you wouldn’t hire some-
body who is older because you might 
find yourself in court, that would in 
itself be discriminatory. 
What we are doing with this legisla-
tion is just bringing this to an equal 
perspective with other categories. You 
shouldn’t discriminate based on eth-
nicity, gender, or sexual preference. 
Why should you have any different per-
formance standards or adhere to the 
same level for older people? 
Given that baby boomers, people of 
my generation, find they have to work 
longer and harder, and given the issues 
around retirement, I would think that 
all of us would want to make sure that 
they were protected and that the econ-
omy would get the benefit of their wis-
dom and experience, and not have them 
discriminated against. 
On the second subject, Ben Franklin 
once famously said at the beginning of 
this country that an investment in 
education is always the best invest-
ment. 
Sadly, with this administration, Mr. 
Franklin might not say that because 
young people who are encouraged to 
get degrees, to get undergraduate de-
grees and graduate degrees to be part 
of a knowledge-based economy, to take 
that access to the best educational sys-
tem in the world in higher education in 
this country, it would end with them in 
debt and with a degree that is worth-
less in the open marketplace. 
I would think that all Members of 
Congress would want to protect both 
aging workers and students who are de-
frauded. 
Mr. Speaker, as you can see, we are 
on the floor this week to restore jus-
tice to those who need our help. Strug-
gling students and workers deserve our 
support, not for us to turn our backs on 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 790 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the resolution 
(H. Res. 791) condemning the actions of the 
Government of Iran and supporting the pro-
testers in Iran, their demands for account-
ability, and their desire for the Government 
of Iran to respect freedom and human rights. 
The resolution shall be considered as read. 
The previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the resolution and preamble to 
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question except one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Clause 
1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consid-
eration of House Resolution 791. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair 
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum 
time for any electronic vote on the 
question of the adoption of the resolu-
tion.

COM-

Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, by di-

offer a privileged resolution and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 793 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
ber be, and is hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committee of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE
ON NATURAL RESOURCES: Mr. 
Garcı´a of Illinois. 
Mr. JEFFRIES (during the reading). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be considered as 
read and printed in the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

APPOINTMENT

TO BOARD OF FEDERAL JUDI-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

and the order of the House of January 
3, 2019, of the following individuals to 
the board of the Federal Judicial Cen-
ter Foundation on the part of the

PRAISE FOR NEWARK MENTORING 
MOVEMENT 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to praise the Newark Mentoring 
Movement, an organization that wants 
to turn Newark into ‘‘Mentor City.’’ 
Unlike most mentoring organiza-
tions, they do not supply mentors. In-
stead, they do a more valuable thing. 
They connect politicians with organi-
zations who support mentoring so they 
can discuss how to increase mentoring 
opportunities in the future. 
The importance of mentors in Amer-
ica has never been greater. Today, 
more than 30 percent of children come 
from single-parent homes, and it is in-
credibly difficult to raise children 
alone. Mentors give these parents a 
helping hand. They give their children 
a role model. They can help increase 
their grades and increase their self-es-
teem. In addition, they can put stu-
dents on a better path and keep them 
on a positive trajectory. 
We need to dedicate more time and 
resources to provide mentors for chil-
dren across this great Nation. Every 
child must be given a chance to suc-
ceed.

for over 20 years. He started with Lake-
land P.D. in 2013 and epitomized cour-
age and sacrifice. 
Officer Dunn sadly passed away fol-
lowing a tragic on-duty traffic crash on 
January 9. He leaves behind a devoted 
wife, who is a detective with Lakeland 
P.D. and five children. 
This is the second officer Lakeland 
P.D. has lost over a 5-week period, and 
their losses have a wide impact on the 
surrounding communities. Yet the thin 
blue line that Officer Dunn was a part 
of continues to serve, continues to pro-
tect, and continues to allow us peace of 
mind. 
I am grateful for him and for all of 
those who don the uniform with dig-
nity, fairness, and justice. I thank 
them from the bottom of my heart. 
Mr. Speaker, our prayers are with 
the family of Officer Dunn. He was 
treasured in our community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JODY 
WILSON 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay my respects to Jody 
Wilson, a veteran who passed away last 
month. 
Jody was dearly loved by her friends, 
family, and community. She served 
bravely in the United States Army for 
9 years. 
After her military service, Jody 
served her community as a clerk, a 
nurse, and later as a letter carrier for 
the United States Postal Service. Her 
kindness, sense of humor, and infec-
tious smile were sources of joy for 
those who knew and loved her. 
Arizona has lost an incredible com-
munity member, veteran, and public 
servant. 
Pat and I are keeping Jody’s family, 
friends, and community in our prayers 
as we mourn her passing. 
f 
CELEBRATING INDIANA 
UNIVERSITY’S BICENTENNIAL 
(Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
HOLLINGSWORTH. 
Madam 
Speaker, on January 20, Hoosiers will 
celebrate a big milestone. Indiana Uni-
versity will turn 200 and share those 200 
years of academic excellence and nota-
ble achievements with the whole world. 
For 200 years, Indiana University has 
provided top learning opportunities to 
Hoosiers and out-of-staters alike, with 
countless job opportunities to those in 
the Bloomington area. It is world-re-
nowned for programs like the Jacobs 
School of Music, the Kelley School of 
Business, and Hoosier basketball. 
Since its establishment in 1820, Hoo-
siers have graduated from IU and gone 
off to change the world. Indiana’s fac-
ulty and alumni include Rhodes schol-
ars, Nobel laureates, Olympic medal-
ists, and Pulitzer Prize winners, just to 
name a few. 
IU’s bicentennial will be celebrated 
on campus in Bloomington by alumni 
across the globe and through immense 
contributions every single day that the 
Hoosiers at Indiana University make. 
Big Red 200 is a new supercomputer 
whose name reflects our bicentennial 
and the common ‘‘Go Big Red’’ cheer 
played 
at 
football 
and 
basketball 
games. Big Red 200 is the fourth in IU’s 
Big Red computer series and is on pace 
to become the fastest university-owned 
supercomputer in the Nation. 
As a member of the House Financial 
Services Task Force on Artificial Intel-
ligence, I have seen the exciting oppor-
tunities America has to invest in AI 
transform a number of sectors like 
healthcare 
and 
financial 
services 
through that continued data sciences 
research, and I am confident that IU 
will be at the forefront. 
Madam Speaker, I extend congratula-
tions on 200 years, and I look forward 
to the next 200 years of academic excel-
lence. 
f 
REAFFIRM BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 
FOR UKRAINE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co- 
chair of the Bipartisan Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, I rise to introduce a 
resolution reaffirming the House’s bi-
partisan support for Ukraine, our ally. 
This 
time-sensitive 
measure 
pro-
claims the United States’ vital stra-
tegic interest in preserving liberty and 
democracy in Ukraine and across Eu-
rope. 
In 2014, Vladimir Putin’s Russia in-
vaded Ukraine without provocation. 
Over 5 years later, Ukraine remains en-
gaged in a heroic struggle to defend its 
freedom and sovereignty. 
Today, Ukraine represents the scrim-
mage line for liberty on the European 
Continent and globally. 
This resolution makes clear that we 
in Congress recognize the sacrifice that 
Ukrainians make each day to defend 
liberty in Europe. As our ally, we sup-
port her continued defense, growth, 
and success. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join this timely resolution. 
f 
SUPPORT PRO-LIFE MEASURES 
(Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to mark 47 years since the 
Roe v. Wade decision and to affirm my 
commitment to defending the unborn. 
The discovery last year of thousands 
of fetal remains in the garbage of 
Ulrich Klopfer, Indiana’s most prolific 
abortionist, was a tragic reminder of 
the terrible cost of abortion. 
After this shocking event, I intro-
duced the Dignity for Aborted Children 
Act, which would require the dignified 
burial or cremation of aborted fetal re-
mains, with a strong reporting require-
ment to hold abortion providers ac-
countable. 
I also signed a discharge petition to 
bring the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act to the House 
floor for a vote. This commonsense bill 
would ensure a child born alive after a 
failed abortion attempt would receive 
the same kind of medical care any 
other child would. 
Madam Speaker, as we mark 47 years 
since Roe v. Wade, we have a lot of 
work to do to stop a radical agenda and 
stand up for the sanctity of life. Con-
gress can start by passing these two 
pro-life bills without delay. 
f 
RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE 
YOUTH AWARDS 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, 
right here in Washington, D.C., I had 
the honor of speaking to families and 
to 15 beautiful youth, American citi-
zens of the United States of America 
who are going to be the future doctors, 
researchers, and teachers of this great 
United States of America. 
What did they have in common? They 
were all Hispanic youth from this re-
gion on the East Coast of the United 
States, 15 young people who are talk-
ing about their dreams for curing can-
cer, their dreams of becoming teachers 
to inspire the youth of America. These 
are the kinds of young people who 
make this America great. 
Another thing that they had in com-
mon: most of their parents’ primary 
language was Spanish. But let me tell 
you, people of this great Nation, the 
parents whom I met last night love 
this country so much and appreciate 
all the opportunities that their won-
derful American citizen children have 
the opportunity to aspire to and to 
achieve. 
Again, we have a great, eclectic Na-
tion, and I was so pleased to meet 
those 15 young people who already are 
leaders in our great Nation and will be 
the leaders of today and tomorrow be-
cause this country is great.

CONGRATULATING JOHN P. GILL 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House

Mr. 
HILL

Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize John 
P. Gill of Little Rock, Arkansas, who is 
being honored with Preserve Arkansas’ 
2019 Parker Westbrook Award for Life-
time Achievement. 
This award recognizes significant in-
dividual achievement in historic pres-
ervation and is Preserve Arkansas’

vation over a long period of time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H225 
January 14, 2020 
Throughout his career, both as an at-
torney and as a historian, John’s pas-
sion for preservation was evident by 
his service in a number of capacities 
throughout central Arkansas, includ-
ing sitting on the board of Little Rock 
Visitor Information Center Foundation 
and leading the efforts to preserve and 
restore Curran Hall. He also was presi-
dent of the board of Preserve Arkansas 
in 2010. 
John has demonstrated his passion 
for preservation through his commit-
ment to service and leadership. I con-
gratulate my friend John Gill on re-
ceiving this year’s Parker Westbrook 
Award for Lifetime Achievement. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
National 
Human Trafficking Awareness Month. 
In my home State of California, 
human trafficking is a massive and 
dangerous industry, with 375 reported 
cases of trafficking involving minors in 
2018. This must end. 
That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 
836, the Interdiction for the Protection 
of Child Victims of Exploitation and 
Human Trafficking Act, introduced by 
my colleague, Mr. MCCAUL from Texas. 
This bill would establish a pilot pro-
gram to provide training to Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement offi-
cers on identifying child victims of 
trafficking, 
exploited 
children, 
and 
missing children. 
Indeed, the cues are out there, if we 
can see them. If our law enforcement is 
able to identify victims of human traf-
ficking more quickly, it would lead to 
a safer environment, and identifying 
them a lot sooner would save more of 
the individuals. 
Our 
most 
vulnerable 
populations 
need our help in order to keep them 
safe from this truly heinous and dis-
gusting crime. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PABLO CUEVAS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, if you 
were to attend any public event in 
Rockingham County, it is likely that 
you would have the privilege of meet-
ing Pablo Cuevas. 
Today, I rise to recognize Pablo be-
cause, after seven terms and a 30-year 
tenure on the Rockingham County 
Board of Supervisors, he has recently 
retired. 
Cuevas encapsulates the meaning of 
public service. An immigrant from 
Cuba, Mr. Cuevas has not taken lightly 
the privilege it is to live in America. 
Over the years, Pablo has given back to 
his community by not only serving on 
the board of supervisors but also on the 
Broadway Town Council, the Broadway 
Planning Commission, the Rockingham 
County Planning Commission, and the 
James Madison University Board of 
Visitors. 
Some of his greatest accomplish-
ments include constructing new school 
buildings and expanding industries im-
portant to the area, such as agri-
culture. His dedicated service on the 
board of directors at the Virginia Poul-
try Growers Cooperative was invalu-
able to our region. 
His passion for making his commu-
nity a better place for all who live and 
visit the valley is going to be sorely 
missed on the board of supervisors. 
However, I am sure his wife, Elaine, 
and his daughter, Erika, will welcome 
the opportunity to have such a good 
man back home. 
Madam Speaker, I wish Pablo a 
happy retirement and thank him for 
sharing his wealth of knowledge and 
passion for community service with 
Rockingham County for the past 30 
years. 
f 
RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT 
ANDREW ROCK 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize Andrew Rock from 
south New Jersey on his attainment of 
the Eagle Scout rank. 
Eagle Scout is the highest rank at-
tainable from the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica. Only 4 percent of Boy Scouts ever 
achieve this prestigious recognition. 
Eagle Scouts are more likely to dedi-
cate their life to service of all kinds, 
becoming future leaders in military, 
business, or politics. 
I was proud to attend Andrew’s beau-
tiful outdoor ceremony on the lake this 
past November. The ceremony also 
highlighted the beautiful traditions of 
the American Indian people. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate An-
drew. We look forward to big things 
from him in the future. I am proud of 
him; south Jersey is proud of him; and 
the United States of America is proud 
of him. 
f 
TALKING DEBT AND DEFICITS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
PORTER). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s 
an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
to our stenographer, if I start talking 
too fast, just give me that horrible 
look because my staff was telling me 
last week that I was sounding like a 
machine gun. 
Madam Speaker, this is something I 
try to do at least half an hour every 
week. It is basically to have a little bit 
of honesty about math and a little op-
timism about what policy can do to 
make things work. 
Once again, I have a couple of my old 
slides here. I am sorry that I haven’t 
been able to update them because there 
are some new numbers, but it is a real-
ly simple concept. Let’s walk through 
it. 
How many times do you hear Mem-
bers from both the right and the left 
get 
on 
television 
and 
talk 
about 
things? Why does no one talk about the 
debt and deficits? I can tell you why we 
don’t talk about the debt and deficits, 
because to tell the truth of what is 
driving the debt and deficits is really 
uncomfortable. 
We are going to try to do a little bit 
of that math honesty because it is de-
mographics. It turns out, demographics 
are not Republican or Democratic. It is 
just math. 
We continue to exist in this pretend 
world, saying: Well, if we would tax 
rich people more, if we get rid of waste 
and fraud—none of those. 
I have brought these charts here be-
fore. There are fractions of fractions of 
variance. 
Why is it so hard for us to tell the 
truth? Why is it so hard for us to own 
calculators? We basically are a math- 
free zone. 
This slide is a few months old, and I 
am sorry about that because there is 
optimism on the tax cuts in the reve-
nues. As you all know, last fiscal year, 
we 
broke 
over 
4 
percent 
revenue 
growth in a time with lower rates, 
which none of us modeled. The econ-
omy is doing really well there. 
b 1415 
Demands on social services have fall-
en fairly dramatically because of the 
incredibly robust labor environment. 
Discretionary spending, turns out the 
caps that that line is about, the bene-
fits we were getting from the caps, 
when we did the budgetary deal func-
tionally in September and October, we 
blew up the caps. So this line is bigger; 
this line is smaller. 
But the punch line here is really, 
really simple: 90 percent of rising debt 
deficits between 2019, so last fiscal 
year, and 2029—90 percent Social Secu-
rity and Medicare. 
Now, those are earned entitlements. 
We have a societal obligation to keep 
our promises. But it is mostly Medi-
care. So we can’t have an honest con-
versation here about debt unless you 
are willing to actually have an honest 
conversation 
about 
medical 
costs, 
healthcare costs. 
We are going to pull some slides here 
that I am just incredibly optimistic 
that we could actually have a revolu-
tion in healthcare costs, but the only 
way that happens is this place has to 
grow up intellectually and join this 
century of technology and opportuni-
ties because, once again, let’s go back 
a decade. 
The ACA, ObamaCare, what was it 
really? It was a financing mechanism.

It was who got subsidized and who had 
to pay. 
What did we, as Republicans, do? I 
still think ours was much better. It 
wasn’t who got subsidized and who had 
to pay; it was who had to pay and who 
got subsidized. 
We basically debate about healthcare 
financing. We do not have honest con-
versations about how to crash the 
price, because it is a really uncomfort-
able conversation because the things 
that would crash the price often actu-
ally make us have to have very uncom-
fortable conversations with our con-
stituencies. 
The different groups that are wan-
dering the hallways right across the 
street right now lobbying us for this or 
that, they believe in their causes. They 
are wonderful people. But there is a 
disruption of technology. 
So let’s sort of walk through the 
math once again so we understand that 
we could have this amazing future if we 
could just focus on the facts. 
This is a slide I have been showing al-
most for a year. If you and I remove 
Social Security and Medicare out of 
the 30-year projection, we have $23 tril-
lion in the bank. If we pull Social Se-
curity and Medicare—and this chart is 
not inflation adjusted, so you could re-
move about a third of it if you want to 
do constant dollars and you will see 
the difference of what is actual spend-
ing and then the financing costs, the 
interest on those. But if you pull So-
cial Security and Medicare back into 
that number, we are $103 trillion in 
debt. 
So think about that difference: 23 
cash positive, $103 trillion in debt. 
For those of you who care about your 
Medicare, you care about Social Secu-
rity, you actually want these to exist, 
we must be honest about the math, be-
cause if we don’t get our act together, 
we are going to get squeezed and there 
are no more dollars. 
It is math. It is not Republican math; 
it is not Democratic math; it is demo-
graphics. 
We have 73 million of us who are 
baby boomers. We are about halfway 
through retirement. That is what is 
driving the future debt. 
So the next time you hear someone 
walk behind a microphone and say, ‘‘I 
am very concerned about the excess 
spending; I am very concerned about 
debt and deficits,’’ if their next sen-
tence isn’t, ‘‘And I am going to work 
on a revolution to change the costs of 
healthcare and the things we provide,’’ 
they are not being honest about how 
we save this society or how we save 
this country. 
So, one more time, just to get our 
heads around the scale of the problem, 
and then we are going to actually talk 
about solutions. 
This is a 2024 chart, so it is only 
what? Now, that is 3 fiscal years from 
now. 
Nondefense, this is discretionary. 
This is what we get to vote on. This is 
defense. Everything you see in a blue 
shade there is on autopilot. 
Do you notice something? The vast 
majority of spending is on autopilot. 
We don’t vote on it. We don’t do policy 
on it, and it is consuming everything. 
So get our heads around something. 
Just the growth, just the growth of So-
cial 
Security, 
Medicare, 
and 
the 
healthcare entitlements, over the next 
5 years, just the growth portion equals 
one of these wedges. It functionally 
equals the entire Defense Department 
spending. 
So, if you are someone who walks in 
the door and says, ‘‘Well, we spend too 
much money on defense; get rid of it,’’ 
do you realize you just took care of 
only 5 years of the growth? What do 
you want to do with everything else? 
Over 10 years, it equals all the discre-
tionary spending. 
Once again, it is demographics. 
Why is this place so uncomfortable to 
talk about that? Because it violates 
the pitches we go home and tell our 
voters. But it is math and it is honest, 
and if we keep avoiding the subject, the 
future becomes incredibly ugly. If we 
take it on, there is a path where things 
work. 
So every week I come behind this 
microphone and I say, here is where 
the problem is, but here are solutions. 
And the very last slide is the one we do 
all the time, where we believe we have 
a formula where you grow the economy 
very aggressively. You do things from 
tax policy to immigration policy to 
trade policy that maximize economic 
velocity, and you are seeing some of 
that right now. 
If I had come to this room a couple of 
years ago and said we are going to live 
in a time where we have more jobs 
than available workers, where the bot-
tom 10 percent, the working poor in 
our society, have had the fastest grow-
ing wages in modern times, basically 
double what the mean is—it is work-
ing. 
We should be, actually, as Repub-
licans and Democrats, trying to figure 
out what is working, particularly for 
those quartiles—and I hate that term— 
those quartiles in our population that 
we were writing off a couple of years 
ago: You don’t have a high school de-
gree, you don’t have skills, we are writ-
ing you off. You are part of the perma-
nent underclass. 
That was brutal. It was arrogant. It 
was vicious. It was wrong. 
We know, right now, over the last 
couple of years, the movement of wages 
for those very people we were writing 
off 3 years ago, it is working. 
How do we keep that going? 
If you love and care about people, we 
need to keep this going, because, in my 
lifetime, there has never been a period 
of this type of economic growth and 
stability. Let’s keep it going. 
But let’s not pretend that our future 
isn’t buried in debt. Once again, if we 
take a look at it, it is substantially the 
growth of Medicare. 
I intend that this Congress is going 
to keep its promises, but, mathemati-
cally, we are not going to keep our 
promises unless we actually deal with 
the reality. 
So when we have come in here, we 
have tried to show that there is a path, 
but 
beyond 
the 
economic 
growth 
issues. 
We have labor force participation. 
You can’t grow the economy unless our 
brothers and sisters are working, and 
those are folks who are both older, but 
we still have a problem with millennial 
men. 
We had a miracle begin a year ago, 
December, where millennial females 
started entering the labor force in 
droves. The math right now says there 
are more females in the labor market 
than there are males. 
Those are good things, because when 
we did tax reform, the joint tax folks, 
you know, the 50 of them who are all 
freaky smart, said your two problems 
of continuing the economic expansion 
will be capital stock—and I know I am 
getting a little geeky, and I am sorry— 
but capital stock, available capital for 
lending, for borrowing, for the growth, 
and people, available labor. 
It turns out they were completely 
wrong on the capital stock. We have 
had hundreds and hundreds of billions 
of dollars more in what we call repatri-
ation come back into the country than 
we had originally modeled. People are 
saving much more of their tax savings 
from tax reform than we ever modeled. 
So the United States now is flush 
with cash. This is working over here. 
We have great capital stock, and you 
see it in our interest rates. 
Our biggest fragility right now for 
continued economic expansion is actu-
ally labor participation. Now, there are 
miracles there. 
Sure, because we are all really geeky, 
we all ran and looked at the U–6 unem-
ployment numbers last Friday—not the 
top line, not where we stayed at 3.5, 
but the actual, what we used to talk 
about for years, ‘‘What is the real un-
employment?’’ and you saw now we are 
in the sixes. We broke below 7 percent 
of real unemployment. 
These are the folks who had become 
and we wrote off as discouraged work-
ers, not participating; their skill sets 
are outdated. All of a sudden, they are 
entering the labor force. 
We need public policy that continues 
to encourage that. How do you do that? 
How do you take someone who says, ‘‘I 
am older, but I am still a skilled work-
er; yeah, I might need an employer 
that is willing to make some accom-
modations for me,’’ how do we create 
policies that incentivize that? 
For our millennial males, how do we 
create policies that incentivize them? 
Because if we don’t have that labor 
participation, we can’t grow the econ-
omy. 
The other things that also get un-
comfortable, and we are going to talk 
about those today, is: How do you have 
a disruption, a disruption in the cost of 
healthcare? 
I want to argue and I am going to 
make you an argument that we are liv-
ing on the cusp of miracles.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H227 
January 14, 2020 
On one hand, we have technology. 
Many of you are carrying it in your 
pocket. That cell phone, that super-
computer, and the new sensors and 
other 
things, 
the 
ability 
to 
stay 
healthy, the ability to know when you 
have a problem. 
Then, on the other side, the miracle 
cures, the single-shot cure for hemo-
philia that will be here this year, the 
experiment that is going on that cures 
sickle cell anemia. We are in the time 
of miracles. 
Why this side is so important on my 
little upside-down bell curve is 5 per-
cent of our population is the majority 
of our healthcare spending. It is our 
brothers and sisters who have chronic 
conditions. 
What happens if we could get our act 
together and, through a series of fi-
nancing and policy and licensing, these 
new biologic drugs, these new small- 
molecule drugs, these new things we 
are learning, get them to market and 
we are curing people who are part of 
that 5 percent of chronic conditions? 
Even if we can cure parts of their 
struggles, it is wonderful for society, 
and it is also really good for the cost of 
healthcare. 
So we are going to touch base on just 
some things that I find fun, because it 
is part of the—and I know I overuse 
this term—thought experiment of what 
is coming. 
So we now have almost complete 
miracles of technology. This is some-
thing that was just shown last week at 
the Consumer Electronics Show. This 
is a defibrillator you can carry in your 
purse. You can almost carry it in your 
pocket. It is just handheld. 
This type of technology, as you now 
know, with the new types of pace-
makers, the new abilities to help some-
one manage everything from hyper-
tension to arrhythmia to now actually 
being able to restart a heart, this is at 
the Consumer Electronics Show. 
We need to think about these types 
of disruptions. 
Here is one. It turns out, if you were 
to take a look at how many Americans 
will lose their life to heart disease, to 
a heart attack, we now have the ability 
to monitor, with just almost a single 
pod like this in your home, just a sin-
gle patch you put on, talking to your 
phone. These concepts crash the price 
of that disease if we could get them 
adopted. 
It means we, as policymakers, have 
to figure out everything from the ele-
gance of the licensing mechanisms— 
which the FDA does get some credit. 
They have been trying to create some 
kind of a third rail. 
If you wear one of the Apple watches, 
you realize parts of that are coming on 
a new third rail of: Is it technology? Is 
it a health device? 
These things are coming, and we are 
building models now that show they 
can help crash the price of keeping peo-
ple healthy. 
One of the slides I did not bring 
today but we have talked to the pro-
fessor, the thing that looks like a big 
kazoo. I am sorry. This is the best way 
we have to describe it. 
You blow into it, and it instantly 
knows if you have the flu, instantly 
can bounce off your medical records if 
you are carrying them on your phone 
and 
instantly 
can 
order 
your 
antivirals. 
So this could be in your medicine 
cabinet at home. You blow into it. 
They think the future version will be 
able to pick up bacterial infections, 
and the one a couple of years in the fu-
ture will pick up as many as 20 dif-
ferent cancer proteins. 
And it is a kazoo. You blow into it. 
We call it a flu kazoo in our office. 
People laugh at me for that, but they 
remember it. 
Do you know that technology is ille-
gal? 
Think about that. The thing you 
would blow into that instantly knows 
you have the flu, that instantly can 
ping your medical records, knows that 
you are not allergic or are allergic to 
this particular antiviral, orders that 
antiviral and that Lyft or Uber or 
somehow gets it to your door an hour 
later, that process right now is illegal 
under many of our State laws under 
the way we reimburse under the Social 
Security Act because an algorithm is 
writing the prescription. 
Should Congress, a few years ago, 
have slowed down the internet to pro-
tect Blockbuster video from Netflix? 
You have got to understand, we have 
these disruptions in our society; we 
live with them all the time; but we 
sometimes need to step back and say: 
Okay. I like going home and hitting a 
button on my television and seeing all 
those movies instead of going and get-
ting the little silver disc. 
b 1430 
Apparently, Blockbuster Video didn’t 
have armies of lobbyists walking up 
and down the hallways here in Wash-
ington, D.C. trying to protect their 
portion of the business model. 
The technology is here that could 
crash the price of healthcare. Is that 
Republican or Democrat? I am going to 
argue it is just necessary. We do not 
have a choice. Do you remember the 
earlier boards? They were about if we 
don’t have a revolution in healthcare 
costs. 
So part of that same thought experi-
ment, over that next 30 years you saw 
the majority of the debt and deficits 
are driven by Medicare. Thirty percent 
of that spending is just diabetes. What 
happens if—and I accept diabetes I and 
II are incredibly complex, there are 
autoimmune issues, there are lifestyle 
issues, it is complex, but just as part of 
the thought experiment—the single 
biggest impact you could have on fu-
ture deficit spending is a cure for dia-
betes. Does that help sort of put it into 
perspective? 
Let’s actually walk through a couple 
of these. It turns out, remember how I 
said I think it is sort of an upside-down 
cure? On this side is the use of tech-
nology to keep us healthy to be able to 
manage our health issues, if you need a 
pharmaceutical get it quickly, get it 
through use of technology; over here is 
the curative. 
It turns out we are now coming 
across some studies that are talking 
about some of the new gene therapies 
that are crazy expensive, except the 
model is because of the cures they are 
producing, it will save billions of dol-
lars in the future because you are 
cured. The miracles are coming. 
Have you seen what we are able to do 
now in what we call CAR T? That is 
where we find out the type of cancer 
you have, we see what types of proteins 
it is producing, what T cells would 
properly attack it, and we set your 
body’s immune system to attack. Some 
of the companies that are producing 
this technology actually give you a 
guarantee that if it doesn’t work, you 
don’t pay. 
We just had a breakthrough a couple 
weeks ago, it turns out that we may be 
able to not only grow these in a petri 
dish, but we may be able to grow parts 
of those first immune responses to 
these types of diseases in an agnostic 
fashion before it is customized to you, 
so the price is about to crash. What is 
the value of curing your cancer instead 
of trying to find a way where you live 
with it for decades? 
This place needs to think through 
the benefits of: How do we finance the 
cures? And this is where it gets a little 
political. I am sorry I am going to hurt 
some people’s feelings, but there is a 
bill that has moved through this House 
called H.R. 3. It was a drug pricing bill. 
If you will be honest and sit and read it 
in detail, it is basically the keep Big 
Pharma protected bill because what it 
does is it wipes out all the small bio-
logic, small molecule companies that 
are the disrupters. 
These are the ones, you know, the 
product clearance is really simple. The 
drug that cures hemophilia is here. It 
is going to be like a million-and-a-half 
bucks a shot, but in many parts of the 
country hemophilia A may be a half a 
million dollars a year for the clotting 
factor and everything that goes with 
that. A million-and-a-half dollars a 
shot is a great investment. You are 
back in the money after 3 or 4 years. 
Our discussion should be financing that 
and getting those rolled out into soci-
ety really fast. 
But if H.R. 3 had existed when they 
were starting to research that drug, 
that drug would not be here. In a per-
verse way, the incentives are, without 
that drug, the ways of pharma and the 
infrastructure 
around 
that 
disease, 
they don’t have a disruption. They are 
not put out of business by a cure. 
H.R. 3, I know some of my brothers 
and sisters on the Democratic side, we 
have worked on it, we have talked 
about it, they mean well. There are ac-
tually some good things in the bill. But 
the basic reference pricing mechanisms 
that come with it, importing the Euro-
pean model, which in Great Britain a

year of healthy life is worth, I think 
$38,000. So if the drug costs more than 
$38,000, even though it gives you a year 
of healthy life, they don’t buy it. And 
that is what this bill does, it imports 
that pricing mechanism into our mar-
ket. 
It is absurd because we should be 
looking at both pricing mechanisms 
that crash the price where we can, but 
cure. How do we cure our brothers and 
sisters who are part of that 5 percent 
who have chronic conditions that are 
the drivers? 
We just passed a bill through this 
body 
that 
basically 
protects 
Big 
Pharma’s 
current 
monopolies 
and 
wipes out the disrupters that were 
going to take their market share. They 
did it with glee because I think the ha-
tred of Big Pharma blinded from under-
standing who actually won and who 
gets to just change their business 
model a little bit and stay protected 
and who you just wiped out, because 
that would wipe out those miracles 
that are coming. 
I know that is partisan, and I don’t 
mean to hurt anyone’s feelings, but it 
is the math of the legislation. So these 
are important. 
Another thought, if you want to have 
a real disruption that you could do be-
fore the end of this year, half the phar-
maceuticals that will be picked up 
today at pharmacies will not be used or 
will not be used properly. Our model 
says it is a half a trillion dollars a year 
from not using your pharmaceuticals 
properly. The person that doesn’t take 
their hypertension pills and ends up 
having an aneurism, the person over 
here that takes too many, or the per-
son over here gets confused. Half a tril-
lion dollars a year for noncompliance 
with pharmaceutical regimes, and half 
the 
pharmaceuticals 
that 
will 
be 
picked up today will not be used or will 
not be used properly. 
The thought experiment is really 
simple. Go look in your own medicine 
cabinet. Take a look, and what is sit-
ting in there? What is the value of 
what is sitting in there? Let’s be hon-
est. Almost all of us, if we go, yes, I 
probably do have hundreds of dollars of 
value sitting there. Let’s just go after 
one small portion, the efficacy, the 
person who, if they really take their 
hypertension pill every morning, and 
there is a miracle, we think there 
might be a one- or two-shot-a-year sys-
tem about to come that may actually 
intervene instead of having to take the 
daily pill—but I don’t mean to take us 
down that side. 
How about a pill bottle that pings 
you and says, Hey, Bob, you didn’t take 
your hypertension pill this morning. 
Don’t forget, this is really important. 
It turns out, just that $20 piece of tech-
nology would save billions of dollars of 
healthcare costs and stop many trage-
dies in our families. 
I have actually brought the board 
here that is actually for seniors that 
looks a little bit like a dome that drops 
the pills into a little cup and then noti-
fies you, because some people have re-
gimes where they need to take this one 
in the morning, this one during lunch, 
these three before going to bed to stay 
stable. And how many of us have ever 
had that moment saying, Now did I 
take it? Did I remember? This tech-
nology exists. We need to think about 
making those as part of our formulary, 
so we are reimbursed. Because it turns 
out in those cases it is not the price of 
the pharmaceutical, it is our efficacy 
of how we take them. Half a trillion 
dollars a year, because we don’t stay 
on our regimes of our pharmaceutical 
prescriptions properly. 
If you wanted to have a disruption in 
healthcare costs tomorrow, make high- 
value pharmaceuticals, put them in a 
double blister pack, put them in a car-
tridge so they stay sterile, and make 
them returnable. Use technology like 
this so we take our pharmaceuticals as 
we are supposed to. Make it so it could 
also talk to family members or even 
the physicians’ assistants to call in and 
say, Betty, we are getting a notice that 
you haven’t been opening your pill bot-
tle. The technology is here. Why do we 
fight it? 
Here is also a level of disruption that 
was being shown at the consumer elec-
tronics show, but I need to put this a 
little more in context. 
In the Phoenix area we have an ex-
periment going on. I am blessed, I rep-
resent, I truly believe, the greatest 
congressional district you could ever 
imagine. I have north Phoenix and 
Scottsdale, and I have a lot of freaky- 
smart people in our community and 
moving into our community. And there 
is this one business, a couple autono-
mous automobile engineers got to-
gether and said, Hey, we have made a 
lot of money, we want to take on the 
biggest issue in our society, which is 
the cost of healthcare. Let’s try an ex-
periment. Let’s see if we can create au-
tonomous healthcare clinics. 
Think of this, you walk into a 
Safeway grocery store—it is a little un-
fortunate, they are in former Theranos 
spots, but you all get that joke—but 
you walk in the door, you pick up the 
iPad, you sign in. You take a picture of 
your driver’s license, a picture of your 
insurance card. You walk into a booth 
alone. The instructions pop up on the 
screen. You put your arm in this, you 
hold this up, you follow an avatar, you 
shine this in your mouth, your nose, 
your ears, you do this, you look into 
this, and it turns out the algorithm is 
stunningly accurate. And I believe they 
have had a couple of their algorithms 
now certified by the FDA. And there 
are a dozen clinics now or they have a 
dozen clinics in a dozen grocery stores. 
Are we willing to make that tech-
nology legal? Because at the end they 
have to bring a doctor on the screen to 
meet the laws. Well, what would hap-
pen if that autonomous—what they 
call in some of the literature, they now 
refer to them as sensor clinics or sen-
sor healthcare, but we need to think 
about this. This is here. It is coming 
very fast. 
It turns out at the electronics show 
last week they were showing one that 
is a micro size that you could have in 
your medicine cabinet that does many 
of those very same types of tests and 
the algorithm apparently is freaky ac-
curate 
and 
can 
do 
all 
sorts 
of 
diagnostics. Are we ready for this? 
Last year I came and showed a box— 
that actually is sort of what Theranos 
had promised, but it actually now ex-
ists—it is from an Israeli company, it 
is certified in the EU, that does all 
sorts of blood tests. The technology 
now exists. It is not being offered here 
because it is too hard to hit our mar-
ket at this point. 
Go back to the beginning slides. The 
debt and deficit are functionally being 
driven by our demographics. The cost 
of 
those 
demographics 
is 
our 
healthcare. Are we going to continue 
to have the absurd debate around here 
of financing options, which may have 
effects? There are parts of it that are 
good, but they don’t have a disruption. 
Are we going to find a way to promote, 
legalize 
the 
next-generation 
tech-
nology that can crash the price of 
healthcare and make us healthier and 
cure many of the diseases that crush 
our brothers and sisters? 
So back again—the slide we either 
start with or end with—we believe to 
take on the debt-ridden future and 
keep us from breaking through that 95 
percent debt-to-GDP it is not a single 
solution. Today we just did healthcare 
technology disruption. But it is every-
thing. It turns out it is economic poli-
cies that grow because if we don’t grow 
the math, you can’t get anywhere. 
Population stability, how do we 
incentivize family formations? How do 
you build an immigration system that 
is much more talent-based, because— 
let’s be brutally honest—since 1971, the 
United States has been below replace-
ment rate in our birth rates. The last 
few years we have actually had fairly 
stable economic times, the last 2 years, 
great economic times, and our birth 
rates are still falling. 
There is a paper I have in my office 
that says, in about 8, 9, 10 years, two 
workers, one retiree. The math doesn’t 
work. So what do you do to encourage 
family formation? For some Repub-
licans we are going to have to really 
step up and think about that. 
But also for immigration, you need 
to move to a talent-based system. The 
elegance of that is you don’t care about 
someone’s religion, their race, who 
they cuddle with, or where they come 
from. But what you do care about is 
what they bring to our society to maxi-
mize economic expansion. In many 
ways it is a much more honest and ele-
gant system than this carve-out sys-
tem that we have today. 
Changing the way or creating bene-
fits incentives within the benefits of 
Social Security and Medicare to stay 
in the labor force or to come back into 
the labor force or become a part-time 
entrepreneur, we need to fix the way 
we tax certain benefits, the way we

crush people if they are still saving 
when they are older. We need to deal 
with the reality of how much longer 
baby boomers are going to be living. 
And we have got to get our labor force 
participation numbers up. It turns out 
all these things tie together. You can’t 
do one without doing the others to get 
the economic benefits of it. 
And that is what terrifies me about 
our place here: Are we capable of doing 
complex policy, when over here I am 
doing immigration issues, and over 
here I am doing tax reform issues, and 
over here I am doing trade issues, and 
over here I am doing healthcare tech-
nology issues; and understanding they 
are all sympathetic to each other, they 
all tie together to create the economic 
philosophy and the changes in our cost 
structure together? When what we 
have here is a place where we fight 
over the naming of a post office. 
I understand we are living in a time 
of political rage, and that is how so 
many people raise money, how they 
hold office. 
b 1445 
I have a 4-year-old daughter. I am 57 
with a 4-year-old daughter. My wife, 
the same. 
You know I am pathologically opti-
mistic, but I am optimistic because I 
get to get behind this microphone and 
advocate for what I believe is an actual 
path that saves us from a debt-ridden 
future. 
I have been doing this now for a year, 
saying here is the problem, but also of-
fering the steps of a solution. 
I will go back to my office now, and 
the phones won’t ring. There won’t be 
any text messages or emails from even 
fellow Members, let alone the world, 
saying: Hey, DAVID, can you tell me 
about this technology? Can you tell me 
about this? How do we help? 
If we don’t have that revolution, I am 
terrified. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for the 
purposes of a colloquy. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Arizona for high-
lighting a number of different issues, 
starting, of course, with spending and 
talking about the future that we are 
going to deal with from a fiscal stand-
point in our country, particularly the 
extent to which Medicare and our enti-
tlement situation is going to drive 
that, but, importantly, getting to the 
point of disruption, technology, and 
the ways that we can totally transform 
healthcare in a way that will both fix 
our fiscal situation as well as provide 
the best healthcare in the world. 
As the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) knows, I am a cancer sur-
vivor. I am a father, as well, of a 10- 
year-old and an 8-year-old. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I wish he would tell that story more. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I do, and 
I try to talk about it. There are others 
of us in this body who have gone 
through that sort of thing. 
This is what is so critically impor-
tant, what we are talking about: We 
have the ability at our fingertips to 
transform our healthcare system and 
to save our country from the depths of 
$23 trillion, $24 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 
trillion of debt. This is where we are 
headed if we don’t go down this road. 
I know there is a bipartisan thirst for 
this, but we have to stop having our 
leadership in two corners, with shirts 
and skins squabbling instead of focus-
ing on these kinds of roll-your-sleeves- 
up solutions. 
The question I would ask my friend 
from Arizona is, what does he see as 
the obstacles to what we are talking 
about here, in terms of the current sit-
uation with insurance oligopolies and 
the government bureaucracies that get 
in the way of innovation, technology, 
and direct primary care and going to 
the doctors of your choice, and being 
able to get that kind of innovation? 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
look, in some ways, telling the truth is 
like soaking yourself in kerosene and 
running around with a lighter. 
Congress has functionally become a 
protection racket. The armies in our 
hallways, both with Democrats and Re-
publicans, say, ‘‘We like this tech-
nology, but,’’ and the ‘‘but’’ always 
happens to be, ‘‘you are going to blow 
up my business model.’’ 
How do we as policymakers stop hav-
ing the arrogance of thinking we know 
what the future is and, instead, design 
the rules, reimbursements, licensing, 
and mechanisms that all go with that 
so the best technology is constantly 
winning and today’s winner, it turns 
out, gets crushed tomorrow because a 
better one comes along? 
Today the way we do it is we build 
walls of protection that say, ‘‘This is 
good. Yeah, there is something incred-
ibly good over here, but.’’ 
That is why I use that Blockbuster 
video example. We all sort of accepted 
that, hey, we used to go get the little 
silver disk and shove it in the machine. 
The creepy guy would give us movie 
recommendations. He was creepy, but 
his movie recommendations were real-
ly good. 
Today, we go home and hit a button. 
We just lived through that, and the 
world didn’t come to an end. 
When it comes to healthcare tech-
nology particularly—and I do a similar 
presentation on environmental tech-
nology. There is stunning stuff that 
could revolutionize those issues. If you 
are concerned with global warming or 
greenhouse gases, the technology is 
here, yet we don’t talk about it be-
cause we know what we know. The 
problem is, much of what I and others 
know is a decade out of date. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I would 
ask the gentleman, does he agree with 
me that when we are talking about this 
kind of disruption, that this is not a 
partisan problem, that this is a prob-
lem of this body not sitting down and 
rolling up its sleeves to try to address 
using innovation and finding how to 
break through and not getting into the 
trap of this town where the power bro-
kers make all the decisions and the 
lobbyists are driving a lot of what we 
are doing so powerful insurance compa-
nies or powerful government entities 
are making decisions for you instead of 
you and your doctor, and technology 
and innovation? 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
we have to be a little careful because I 
find there are certain insurance compa-
nies that are ready to offer a tech-
nology, sensor-based healthcare, but it 
is illegal. 
There are hospitals I have worked 
with that desperately want to do an 
outreach in the community, where 
they are using data and algorithms to 
keep people healthy and to know when 
there is an issue coming. 
It is not only us as Members of Con-
gress and what we know and don’t 
know, and the arrogance of how we 
often do pieces of legislation where we 
don’t future-proof it to use it, and also 
the incentives that are built in to sur-
viving election, raising money, every-
thing there, I will also argue our bu-
reaucracies have become calcified. 
The bureaucracies now have become 
incredible barriers when they say: 
‘‘Well, we don’t see that in the rules; 
therefore, you can’t do it. Yes, it would 
help society. Yes, it would make us 
healthier. Yes, it would.’’ 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, by that, 
government and private sector bu-
reaucracies, and State and Federal. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Exactly, Madam 
Speaker. States are going to be a real 
issue, and then different lobbying orga-
nizations and different constituencies. 
Guess what? We don’t have a choice. 
The single biggest threat to our Nation 
is the massive wave of debt that is 
here. 
One of our charts, in just a decade or 
two, we are running $21⁄2 trillion, al-
most approaching $3 trillion, deficits. 
It is almost all solely driven by our de-
mographics. We have gotten older. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I would 
just like to thank the gentleman. I ap-
preciate his time and his dedication to 
this. Let’s do this again. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I enjoyed it. 
Madam Speaker, there is a path. Will 
we step up and understand that the 
path turns out to be complicated? We 
are going to make some of our con-
stituencies just elated with the oppor-
tunity to change. We are also going to 
terrify some of our constituencies. 
There is a way to get there, and be-
lieve it or not, it is technology. It is 
not Republican technology. It is not 
Democratic technology. It turns out it 
is math, and the math will always win. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H230 
January 14, 2020 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. 
I rise because I love my country, and 
I rise today to talk about impeachment 
and the trial thereof, the trial associ-
ated with impeachment. 
Madam Speaker, there is much to be 
said. However, I assure all that I will 
not say it all. 
I do want to call to the attention of 
those who are paying attention that we 
are now about to embark upon a trial 
in the Senate. 
Impeachment was a function of the 
House of Representatives pursuant to 
Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, 
and the trial is a function of the Sen-
ate pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of 
the Constitution. The trial is to take 
place in the Senate. The House has 
done its job. 
The House acts similar, not the 
same, but it behaves in a fashion simi-
lar to that of a grand jury—similar but 
not the same. The House determines 
whether there is enough evidence for a 
trial to take place, simply put—similar 
but not the same as a grand jury. 
Then it becomes a function of the 
Senate to have a trial. The Senate is 
the only place on planet Earth where a 
President can be tried. 
The President will not be punished at 
this trial, assuming that the President 
is found guilty. There is no punish-
ment. The President can be removed 
from office, but there won’t be any 
punishment similar to what we call 
punishment, as it were, with a court, 
for example, wherein you might be 
fined or accorded some sort of incarcer-
ation. None of that has to do with re-
moval from office. 
There was a big debate about this 
trial of the President. In Federalist 
Paper No. 65, Alexander Hamilton 
speaks at great length about the trial 
of the President. 
It was contemplated in making a 
final decision that perhaps the Su-
preme Court would be the place to try 
the President. With much debate, with-
out going into the nuances, the details, 
this was not concluded to be the appro-
priate place for a trial of the President. 
It was finally concluded that the 
trial would take place in the Senate 
but that, in doing this, there would be 
a presiding officer, and this person 
would be the Chief Justice of the Su-
preme Court. The Senate tries the case 
with the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court presiding. 
In Federalist Paper No. 65, there was 
much talk about this trial and how it 
might 
move 
forward. 
Clearly, 
the 
Framers 
of 
the 
Constitution 
con-
templated that the trial would receive 
evidence, that there would be evidence 
received. Clearly, a fair reading of Fed-
eralist Paper No. 65 would cause one to 
conclude that. 
Of course, the Federalist Papers, as it 
were, there was a conclusion drawn 
that in this trial, there would be evi-
dence presented. The evidence would be 
presented, of course, by the House. We 
call the persons presenting the evi-
dence managers. They will act as law-
yers. The Senate will receive this evi-
dence. 
It was anticipated, in my opinion, 
after perusing Federalist Paper No. 65, 
that the trial could consist of evidence 
beyond what the House might present 
because at a trial, it is expected that 
one might call witnesses and present 
documents, 
present 
additional 
evi-
dence. 
It is my opinion that this is espe-
cially true, and I believe a good many 
constitutional scholars agree with me, 
this is especially true if it is known 
that there are witnesses who have evi-
dence that would be of great value, wit-
nesses who have evidence, material evi-
dence that is relevant, would be of 
great value in coming to a just conclu-
sion, a trial that would have a just con-
clusion, a trial that would afford not 
only the accused to have witnesses to 
testify but also the managers to have 
witnesses to testify. 
You see, the country, the United 
States of America, is entitled to a fair 
trial. The President should have a fair 
trial, but the people should have a fair 
trial. 
If the trial is to be fair in the Senate 
and there are witnesses available, then 
those witnesses ought to be called. If 
the witnesses are not called, and it is 
known that there are witnesses, then 
the question becomes: What are we 
doing? What is the Senate doing? I say 
‘‘we’’; I mean as a country. I am not a 
Senator, obviously. 
What is the Senate doing? If there 
are witnesses who are available and are 
willing to testify, and the Senate de-
cides to simply dismiss the case, what 
is the Senate doing? 
Before I answer that question, let me 
just share this with you. The truth be 
told, not only will the President be on 
trial but also the Senate would be on 
trial. I will answer what the Senate is 
doing, but I must say first that the 
Senate is on trial. 
People are watching not only here in 
the United States of America but 
across the globe. The world wants to 
see the kind of justice that the United 
States of America accords. The world 
wants to know whether the United 
States of America will pursue justice 
such that witnesses who are material 
and relevant will have the opportunity 
to testify. 
b 1500 
What is the Senate doing if the Sen-
ate declines to hear from these rel-
evant witnesses? The Senate is having 
something less than a trial. No ques-
tion, because a trial contemplates wit-
nesses and evidence. 
If the Senate is going to have what 
may amount to a briefing, then there is 
no need to have Chief Justice Roberts. 
The Framers constituted a trial. They 
contemplated a trial with the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court pre-
siding. 
If we are going to have only a brief-
ing, why have the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court present? This would be 
tantamount to a briefing, to simply 
call the Senate to order, receive some 
comments, some statements, and per-
haps whatever the House has sent over. 
But knowing that a witness is avail-
able—multiple witnesses, I might add— 
and not call any of the multiple wit-
nesses would be tantamount to a brief-
ing. 
If the Senate but engages in a brief-
ing, what would we call the results of a 
briefing? In my opinion, justice de-
layed, if not denied—justice delayed, if 
not denied. 
The Framers of the Constitution con-
templated a trial. Federalist Paper No. 
65 contemplates a trial. 
The Senate acts as the triers of fact. 
They conclude with their findings with 
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 
presiding. 
One can easily conclude that the sim-
ple dismissal of a case, wherein others 
are available to give testimony, would 
cause something less than a trial and, 
quite frankly, will be an embarrass-
ment to the Senate, to the country, 
and to our sense of justice. It would be 
an embarrassment to do such a thing. 
As I have read in various publica-
tions, this is being contemplated, to 
simply dismiss the case knowing that 
there are additional witnesses to be 
heard. 
Could it be that in so doing, whether 
by accident or with intent, whether by 
accident or design, if this occurs, could 
it be that we are now seeing a coverup, 
a coverup if you know that there are 
witnesses who are available and who 
would testify but you denied them the 
opportunity to testify by simply dis-
missing the case? Are you partici-
pating in a coverup? 
I pray that there are enough Sen-
ators who will say: ‘‘I will not partici-
pate in what appears to be a coverup,’’ 
and will ask for witnesses to testify. If 
a majority of the Senators should so 
ask, there will be testimony presented. 
We live in a world where it is not 
enough for things to be right. They 
must also look right. It would not and 
will not look right if the Senate knows 
that there are witnesses available and 
declines to call them. It won’t look 
right. 
Some would say it is right because 
the Constitution doesn’t have strict 
guidelines, in terms of how the Senate 
is to perform. But I assure you, the 
Framers contemplated a trial. 
If there is no trial, a simple dis-
missal, there are many people who will 
say that the Senate has engaged in a 
coverup because evidence that should 
be revealed has been concealed, has 
been covered, has been pushed aside. 
The Senate, in my opinion, will do 
our country a disservice if it simply 
dismisses this cause. 
It is my belief that the Senate will 
not dismiss the cause summarily. It is 
my belief that the Senate consists of 
honorable people who are going to take

January 14, 2020 
an oath, and they are going to abide by 
the oath that they will take. 
I was a judge of a small claims jus-
tice court. I will tell you that I mar-
veled at how people, after taking the 
oath as jurors, would rise above the 
many things that would ordinarily in-
fluence them and see to it that justice 
was done. It is a wonderful thing to see 
how people take an oath and take that 
oath seriously. 
I believe that a majority of the Sen-
ators will take the oath seriously, and 
I believe that there will be witnesses, 
or at least one, called to testify. 
I believe that this will happen be-
cause I think that the Senators who 
will do this will understand that jus-
tice is in their hands and that this jus-
tice has much to do with what the wit-
ness will say, but it also has much to 
do with the balance of power that they 
are there to protect. 
The Senators are there to protect the 
balance of power as it relates to the 
cause that has been presented to them. 
The Senators will have to decide 
whether or not the House of Represent-
atives is going to become less than a 
coequal branch of government because 
one of the articles deals with the fact 
that the President has blocked the ap-
pearance of witnesses in the House and 
has blocked the presentation of certain 
evidence, documents, if you will, in the 
House. 
Now it is left up to the Senate to de-
termine whether or not they are going 
to allow a President to block the pres-
entation of evidence and walk away 
without some consequence. 
Blocking 
evidence 
without 
con-
sequence, that is going to be one of the 
considerations before the Senate. Will 
you protect the balance of power? Will 
you assure this country that no one is 
above the law? 
Madam Speaker, I assure you that if 
the Senators do not take this cause se-
riously and simply dismiss it out of 
hand, they are simply saying that the 
President is above the law. 
The President deserves a trial. The 
country deserves a trial. We ought to 
have witnesses presented. 
There ought to be some degree of de-
liberation. The Senate acts as the trial 
jury, the petit jury, if you will, similar 
to a petit jury, a trial jury, but not the 
same. It is not the same because they 
can make decisions about whether evi-
dence will be presented. 
I had a constituent ask me whether 
or not the Chief Justice could decide to 
receive the evidence, and I had to tell 
the truth. The response is that the ulti-
mate judge of whether evidence will be 
received will be 51 Senators. The Chief 
Justice can make rulings, but the Sen-
ators can overrule the Chief Justice 
with a vote. 
The world is watching, and the House 
of Representatives hangs in the bal-
ance, as it relates to the balance of 
power. 
If this Senate simply dismisses out of 
hand, we will have a President with no 
guardrails. There will be no guardrails. 
It doesn’t matter how you feel about 
the President. The question is: How do 
you feel about the country that we 
love? How do you feel about the notion 
that no one is above the law, a very 
bedrock principle in this country? How 
do you feel about this? 
What happens once can happen twice, 
and what happens twice can happen 
multiple times. 
We should not allow this to take 
place. My clarion call to my brethren, 
my 
friends, 
the 
ladies 
and 
gentlepersons of the Senate, is: Do 
more than have a briefing. Do more 
than simply dismiss the cause out of 
hand. 
There will have to be 51 who will con-
clude that there will be more than a 
briefing, that there will be a trial. 
I assure you that there are many of 
us who are waiting to see what will 
happen. Some of us will traverse great 
distances across the country to be in 
Washington, D.C., to make it clear that 
they want to be a part of this history 
for various and sundry reasons. 
The world is watching. We have a 
duty, a responsibility, and an obliga-
tion to the country to have a fair trial, 
a trial where witnesses are called and 
witnesses are examined. 
This is not unusual. This is what 
every person in this country antici-
pates if he or she is charged with an of-
fense. Why would we have the Presi-
dent be above this basic premise of 
calling witnesses to have a fair trial? 
Why would we have one person in the 
country who is above this, above the 
law? Every person is subjected to the 
law in this country. 
Madam Speaker, I will close with 
these words: It is not enough for things 
to be right. They must also look right. 
If the Senate does this simply be-
cause it has the power, meaning if the 
Senate simply dismisses because it has 
the power and doesn’t call witnesses, 
that won’t look right, and in my opin-
ion, it won’t be right. 
The Senate has a responsibility to 
have a trial, and witnesses must be 
called. I do believe that witnesses will 
be called. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT TIMELINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, my elo-
quent friend so ably made his case, and 
I would suggest that it is undercut in 
some respects when one introduces and 
discusses impeachment the day after 
the election in 2016, before President 
Trump even came to office. 
That isn’t protecting the country, is 
it? What that is suggesting is that one 
knows more than the voters of this 
country. 
I am also always intrigued when the 
complaint comes up about the majority 
in the Senate, when the majority in 
the Senate is going to determine the 
rules for the trial in the Senate be-
cause the Constitution says that the 
Senate holds the trial. 
We just heard that there have to be 
51 votes over in the Senate. Oddly 
enough, I didn’t hear complaints when 
the majority in the House controlled 
the inquiry. In fact, the term ‘‘cover-
up’’ was used preemptively regarding 
the Senate, but what I saw in the 
House was a coverup. 
We didn’t get to introduce all of our 
witnesses. I sit on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. Who did we get as witnesses? 
We got three or four law professors who 
came in. That is who got to come in to 
testify 
before 
the 
Judiciary 
Com-
mittee. 
We didn’t have the witnesses who had 
factual evidence come in. We re-
quested. We gave lists. We were told we 
couldn’t have them. That is part of the 
problem. 
Adding to this hypocrisy, we heard 
over and over again that we must im-
peach the President of the United 
States because it is an imminent dan-
ger for him to continue in his office. 
But once that vote was taken, the 
Speaker held the Articles of Impeach-
ment and would not transmit them. 
Here we sit, 27 days following that 
vote, with no transmittal. 
We hear that there is going to be a 
transmittal tomorrow. I am interested 
to see if that really takes place. 
Madam Speaker, I am joined today 
by a number of my colleagues, and I 
am grateful to have them here. 
I yield to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today one last 
time to ask the House to drop these 
charges against our duly elected Presi-
dent, if, for no other reason, because 
the process that they have used has 
been the exact partisan process that 
was just condemned on the floor by 
people who were the first to call for im-
peaching the President, the Speaker of 
this body. 
This is a 2.5-year endeavor, in spite of 
it being only a few months after the 
call to Ukraine that is supposedly the 
abuse of power that the President en-
gaged in. 
As for the other charge, they say 
that it was obstruction of justice, but 
the House didn’t even bother to enforce 
its own subpoenas. 
The 
impeachment 
process 
boldly 
broke with that of Presidents Nixon 
and Clinton. The urgency was so great 
that the House declined to enforce its 
subpoenas and relied on shaky evi-
dence, trying to move swiftly so they 
didn’t lose the momentum.

Now, when they realize they haven’t 
made the case—not just that it will be 
needed in the Senate, but for the Amer-
ican people, first and foremost—they

want to strong-arm the Senate into 
adopting the same unfair partisan 
course charted here in the House. 
Fortunately, it doesn’t work like 
that. Voters deserve better from our 
House of Representatives, but it is not 
the House’s prerogative to dictate the 
rules of the Senate. 
This partisan impeachment should be 
dropped today. This political charade is 
a waste of taxpayer dollars. It is unfair 
to the President of the United States 
or anyone else to be treated beneath 
the law. Certainly no one is above the 
law, but the President of the United 
States is certainly not beneath the 
law. 
Rather than give in to our worst par-
tisan 
inclinations, 
Congress 
should 
strive to work together on real policies 
that will benefit all of the American 
people. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I point 
out that, in Article I, Section 2, Clause 
5, it says: ‘‘The House of Representa-
tives shall choose their Speaker and 
other officers; and shall have the sole 
power of impeachment.’’ 
I would note, also, that in Section 3, 
when we talk about the Senate: ‘‘Judg-
ment in cases of impeachment shall 
not extend further than to removal 
from office,’’ et cetera. 
Clause 6: ‘‘The Senate shall have the 
sole power to try all impeachments.’’ 
This is what the Constitution says. 
This is not unclear. The United States 
Senate has the power to try impeach-
ments, yet the Speaker of this body 
has tried to impose her will on the 
United States Senate. 
If the Speaker is so interested in 
what is going on in the Senate, maybe 
the Speaker should run for the Senate. 
But what we have today is a body, 
the House, that acted; and the leader of 
this body, the Speaker, is refusing to 
do her duty to transmit the articles to 
the Senate and has done so despite a 
lot of rhetoric over the course of the 
year about the urgency of running im-
peachment through this body, which 
now, I think, the vast majority of the 
American people have seen it for what 
it was: a political action, a political 
stunt, to target the President of the 
United States, to demean the office of 
the President of the United States, to 
target him very specifically for polit-
ical purposes rather than the solemn 
duty that impeachment is supposed to 
be reserved for. 
So we should now be getting this to 
the Senate so that the President can 
have his day to defend himself, his day 
in court, as it were. He should have his 
day in the United States Senate. He 
should be able to defend himself and 
have lawyers defend against what is 
being charged against him from this 
wrongful impeachment out of this 
House. 
So I am hopeful that we will finally 
get that movement this week and that 
the President will have the time due 
him in the United States Senate and 
that the United States Senate can get 
through this in an expedited way so 
that we can get back to the business 
the American people sent us here for: 
dealing with debt, dealing with spend-
ing, dealing with open borders, and 
dealing with men and women in uni-
form and what they need. 
I appreciate the gentleman from Ari-
zona for arranging this. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Arizona, (Mr. 
GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, Speak-
er PELOSI and the House Democrats 
rushed through the weakest impeach-
ment in American history. Devoid of 
any evidence of wrongdoing by Presi-
dent Trump, Speaker PELOSI and her 
Caucus allowed their hatred of Presi-
dent Trump to triumph at all costs. 
Now House Democrats are demanding 
the Senate hold a trial dictated by 
their terms, including witness testi-
mony they failed to obtain themselves. 
Since House Democrats want more 
witnesses, I will gladly offer some 
names for the Senate to consider. 
How about Joe and Hunter Biden? 
Together, they peddled the influence of 
the Vice President’s office for Hunter 
Biden’s personal financial gain. It is 
plainly on video. 
How about ADAM SCHIFF? He spent 2 
years severely misleading the Amer-
ican people about Russian collusion, 
held secret hearings at the Capitol 
basement, and was caught redhanded 
coordinating with the alleged whistle-
blower. 
Ah, yes, why don’t we hear from the 
alleged whistleblower? Reports indi-
cate he worked for Joe Biden, coordi-
nated with ADAM SCHIFF, and has deep 
anti-Trump views. President Trump de-
serves to face his secret Democratic ac-
cuser. 
How did we end up in this impeach-
ment mess? The simple truth is the 
abuse of the FISA court to spy on the 
Trump campaign. 
Yes, you heard it: the weaponization 
of the Federal Government against the 
people. This is the insidious inbreeding 
of the swamp, corruption, plain and 
simple. The President and others are 
victims of a crime. 
It is said that those who don’t learn 
from history are doomed to repeat it, 
and look what is happening with the 
FISA court now. Just this week, the 
Foreign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Court appointed David Kris, an Obama- 
era DOJ lawyer, to review the abuse of 
the FISA court, a person who is al-
ready engaged in FISA denialism. 
Yes, let me be clear, perfectly clear: 
A FISA abuse denier is now in charge 
of tackling the FISA abuse. I guess, 
America, only in the Washington, D.C., 
swamp. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOH-
MERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this 
is an important time. We have got peo-
ple who are demanding that the Senate 
do what they hypocritically refused to 
do here in the House, and that is to 
have a fair investigation and have fair 
hearings. 
And, in fact, we know the majority is 
the majority; they can change the 
rules anytime they want to. But they 
didn’t even bother to change the rules. 
They just said: Do you know what? 
Even though the rules say that the mi-
nority can have a minority witness 
day, we are going to just ignore that 
and move on, because time is of the es-
sence. 
So we didn’t need any evidence to 
show that our friends were not being 
completely genuine with their com-
ments, no, because we heard: Clear and 
present danger; urgent; urgency; got to 
happen now; we can’t wait; we can’t 
follow the rules; we can’t hear wit-
nesses here in the House; we have got 
to have this impeachment done. 
And then they sit on it for over a 
month. Seriously, that says what any-
body needs to say. 
This was never serious to begin with 
in the respect that there was a serious 
charge. There was no serious charge. It 
is supposed to be about treason, brib-
ery, high crimes, misdemeanors. All of 
those 
are 
crimes, 
including 
mis-
demeanors. 
Look at the charges: abuse of power, 
obstruction of Congress. Those are the 
two charges that those pushing im-
peachment are guilty of, not this Presi-
dent. 
Madam Speaker, this is a scam. It is 
a shame. 
The Senate should just go in and 
have a trial, follow the Clinton rules, 
and that is it. Let’s get this done. Let’s 
get it over with. A proper verdict is not 
guilty, not removed. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, as I sat 
in the basement of this Capitol listen-
ing to deposition after deposition, it 
was very clear that this impeachment 
shenanigan was never about a real 
search for truth. 
House leadership wanted us to be-
lieve, the American people to believe, 
that this impeachment process began 
as a result of a July phone call when, 
in reality, Speaker PELOSI said that 
this began 21⁄2 years ago. They wanted 
us to believe that the evidence was ir-
refutable, when the truth is they polled 
to figure out, to see what to charge the 
President with. 
The way this is supposed to work in 
an investigation is that there is a 
crime that produces evidence that 
leads to a verdict. When this started 
with the verdict, it was a search for 
evidence that was never found, and yet 
we are sending impeachment articles 
to the Senate. 
This is crazy. 
And, of course, it has taken over 4 
weeks to get what was urgent—the 
Speaker said this was urgent. She said 
this is urgent, so we will be bringing 
the articles. It has been 4 weeks to get

the articles from here across to the 
Senate. 
This is a straight line. You go 
straight through this door, walk about 
90 seconds and you will be in the Sen-
ate; yet, it has taken 4 weeks. 
This is crazy and should not happen. 
Senator FEINSTEIN said the longer it 
goes on, the less urgent it becomes. So, 
if it is serious and urgent, send them 
over; if it isn’t, don’t send them over. 
I will be voting appropriately on this 
and the fact that it is not urgent and 
we haven’t sent them over. 
Let’s get back to the work we were 
elected to do: keeping this Republic 
and ensuring the blessings of liberty 
for future generations. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, we 
have watched our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle since, literally, 
the week the President was inaugu-
rated say it is time to start the im-
peachment. They have made that a pol-
icy consideration, a policy goal for the 
whole rest of their time since that time 
in Congress, working diligently day by 
day, no matter what the President did, 
no matter what he said. Whether it was 
comments about other Members of 
Congress, whether it is comments in 
foreign policy, you name it, it was wor-
thy of impeachment. 
Madam Speaker, they have cheap-
ened impeachment. 
We were told—rightly so—how sol-
emn it is, the most important thing, 
other than declaring war, that Mem-
bers of Congress would ever embark on. 
Yet, during the vote on the floor of the 
House, 
when 
the 
numbers 
came 
through that they had indeed passed 
impeachment and Members on the 
other side began to cheer, the Speaker 
gave them a look and admonished them 
because, of course, they said it was the 
most solemn thing that they would do. 
Yet, we all know, in their hearts, it 
was what they had desired all along. 
I understand disagreements with the 
President of the other party—I have 
had my own—but this is about doing 
the business of the work of the people 
and the work of this country. 
If you disagree, there is a process for 
that in this country, and that is the 
election process, where all Americans 
get to decide whether whatever the 
President says is too much, whether 
whatever the President does is too lit-
tle or too much. 
But this is seeking to remove a Presi-
dent from office early because of a dis-
agreement over policy, a disagreement 
about how one comports himself or 
not, a disagreement with the President 
that is personal. 
This is beneath the decorum of this 
establishment and the business that we 
should be doing. It is disappointing. It 
is disrupting. It should be voted ‘‘no,’’ 
accordingly, because it is a fool’s er-
rand based on no facts, not based on 
the Constitution and not based on our 
best will and best judgment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
for the Articles of Impeachment to be 
transmitted. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
YOHO). 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, let’s 
take a look at the chronological 
timeline since Donald Trump won the 
primary. I mean, this movement start-
ed immediately after that. 
You can go to Mark Zaid, the attor-
ney for the whistleblower. You can go 
on and hear the Members of this body 
saying: We are going to impeach him. 
The vile words that came out of one 
of the Members from Michigan, saying: 
We are going to impeach this m-effer. 
Those people shouldn’t even be al-
lowed to serve in here with that kind of 
an attitude and hatred. They set a goal 
to impeach this President. They didn’t 
have a reason, but they set a goal, and 
then they searched for that goal. 
It was the Steele dossier that was 
completely fabricated, paid for by the 
Clinton campaign and DCCC, com-
pletely dispelled as false, but yet they 
went down this. They dispelled the 
Mueller report. They kept going to find 
something. 
And then ADAM SCHIFF said: We have 
irrefutable evidence that this Presi-
dent colluded with the Russians. That 
turned out to be false. The whistle-
blower, and the second whistleblower, 
and I could go on, but you guys have 
heard enough of that stuff. 
I want to come back to what our 
Founding Fathers said. This is Wash-
ington’s warning to this Republic 223 
years ago. 
The Constitution rightly sets a high 
bar for impeachment, but the integrity 
of the process also depends on the abil-
ity of legislators to vote their minds 
independent of party politics. Remov-
ing a President is too important, and 
lawmakers are given too much latitude 
to 
define 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors for it to be any other way; 
otherwise, excessively partisan politi-
cians could overturn an election simply 
because the President is a member of 
the opposing party. 
It is in regards to this impeachment 
process that George Washington fore-
warned us of this moment in history 
when political parties ‘‘may now and 
then answer popular ends,’’ but ‘‘they 
are likely, in the course of time and 
things, to become potent engines by 
which cunning, ambitious, and unprin-
cipled men’’ and women ‘‘will be en-
abled to subvert the power of the peo-
ple and to usurp for themselves the 
reins of government. . . . ’’ 
That is what we have here. 
b 1530 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOR-
DAN). 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, im-
peachment didn’t start with Ukraine. 
It started before he was elected. It 
started on July 31, 2016, when the FBI 
opened an investigation and spied on 
four American citizens associated with 
the President’s campaign. That is when 
it started. It continued after he was 
elected before inauguration when they 
go up to Trump Tower and they brief 
the President on the dossier. The dos-
sier that they already knew was false, 
the dossier that Michael Horowitz said 
when they took it to the FISA court 
they lied to the court 17 times. It con-
tinued after inauguration with the 
Mueller investigation and those 2 years 
that we went through. 
Why are the Democrats so focused on 
getting to the President? 
Why are they so focused about going 
after the President? 
Because they don’t like what this 
guy is getting done. They don’t like 
the fact that he is shaking up this 
town. They don’t like the fact that he 
is doing what he said he would do. 
They don’t like the fact that he is 
draining the swamp, and when you 
drain the swamp, the swamp fights 
back. And that is exactly what we are 
seeing from the Democrats in this en-
tire impeachment escapade we have 
lived through now for 4 months that 
has needlessly divided our country. 
Here is the good news: the American 
people get it. They understand it. They 
know the four key facts. They have got 
the call transcript, there was no quid 
pro quo. The two individuals on the 
call, President Trump and President 
Zelensky have repeatedly said: There 
was no pushing, no pressure, and no 
linkage of an investigation to any type 
of security assistance money. We know 
the Ukrainians knew at the time of the 
call that aid wasn’t even on hold at the 
time of the call. Most importantly, 
they took no action to get the money 
released. 
The American people get the facts. 
They know the facts are on the Presi-
dent’s side, and that is why this whole 
thing is wrong. They get the facts, and 
they understand. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Ohio’s com-
ments. 
I want to add one comment. When 
you consider the aid that was the sub-
ject of this issue where people said that 
he withheld aid as a quid pro quo, the 
one thing that America has not heard 
enough of is this: the aid was released 
in perfect compliance with the law. It 
was released in the time constraints re-
quired by the law. In fact, it was re-
leased 3 weeks prior to its being re-
quired to have been released. That has 
not been said enough, nor has it been 
understood enough. So that charge has 
always been bogus. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH). 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, we 
have heard today several times that we 
were told this was urgent and that 
things must move quickly. And yet it 
has been 26 days since it was passed on 
the calendar, 15 working days, and 10 
legislative days have gone by, and yet 
the Senate has not yet been informed 
of the Articles of Impeachment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H234 
January 14, 2020 
Now, Madam Speaker, let me get bor-
ing. Most politicians won’t admit that, 
but that is what I am going to do be-
cause it is important that we under-
stand the process. 
So what happens is the Articles of 
Impeachment 
were 
passed 
by 
the 
House. We were told later this week 
that we are going to vote on managers 
who will then present the Articles of 
Impeachment at the bar of the Senate. 
That is their job. That means to pros-
ecute the case. But the annotations to 
Jefferson’s Manual—that is Jefferson’s 
Manual of Parliamentary Practice and 
Procedure, for all of you policy-and- 
procedure wonks back home—we are 
told in there that the managers who 
are elected by the House or are ap-
pointed by the Speaker in obedience to 
a resolution of the House take this to 
the bar of the Senate, the House having 
previously informed the Senate. 
Now, the problem is the House has 
not previously informed the Senate. 
And what we are going to do now is we 
are going to say: well, that is okay, but 
my summary look at the past indicates 
that the times that these have been 
separated, the notice to the Senate 
that impeachment resolutions were 
coming and the actual sending over of 
the managers to present the articles at 
the bar, the longest previously has 
been 4 days. Here it has been 26 cal-
endar days, 15 working days, and 10 leg-
islative days, and the Speaker of the 
House indicates to us that this is all 
fine and normal. 
Madam Speaker, we should all be 
concerned, not just because we have 
what appears to be a trumped up—pun 
not intended—impeachment policy by 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, but because if the Speaker can 
hold up H. Res. 755, the Articles of Im-
peachment, from being sent over to the 
Senate thus notifying them that man-
agers will be coming to prosecute or 
present these impeachment articles at 
the bar of the Senate, then the Speaker 
can hold up anything the Speaker 
doesn’t want the Senate having. 
There are 435 Members of the United 
States House. While I do not agree with 
the impeachment articles, the House 
voted on them, and the Senate should 
have had those promptly. It takes a 
couple of days to get it through the 
process where all the i’s are dotted and 
t’s are crossed. This Speaker did not do 
that. It is a dangerous precedent be-
cause if H. Res. 755 can be held up, then 
I submit to you, Madam Speaker, any-
thing can be held up. And if a Speaker 
suddenly decides that he or she does 
not agree with the will of this House, 
can they really stick it in their back 
pocket? 
Can they really do a pocket Speaker 
veto of actions of this House? 
Nothing of this nature has ever been 
contemplated, but that is what the ac-
tions of Speaker PELOSI tell us she is 
trying to do or at least tried to do if 
she didn’t get her way in the Senate. It 
is unconscionable and against the prin-
ciples of a democratic republic. 
Be warned, be alert, and pay atten-
tion. Let’s guard our Republic with 
every ounce of our energy. 
Mr. BIGGS. I would ask the Speaker 
how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona has 5 minutes re-
maining 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate those who shared their thoughts 
on this matter, and I want to just cover 
a couple of things that I think are ab-
solutely critical to remember. They 
have been touched on, but not empha-
sized enough for me, and that is this: 
when we start looking at how this 
began and we look at the timeline, you 
will see that this began before Presi-
dent Trump was elected, it proceeded 
after he was elected but before he was 
sworn into office, and then the day he 
was sworn in, the media said: Let the 
impeachment begin. 
Ten days later the attorney for the 
whistleblower said: 
Let the impeachment begin, let the coup 
begin, more power to the attorneys. 
That is what they were talking 
about, a search, as one of my col-
leagues said earlier, for a modus 
vivendi for impeachment. That is real-
ly what this was about. 
Or you get in a phone conversation, 
and in that phone conversation there is 
an amicable discussion of numerous 
things. That phone conversation has 
been misquoted, and it has been delib-
erately fabricated by the person who 
no doubt will be one of the House man-
agers going over to the Senate. This is 
the chairman who basically out of 
whole cloth created a dramatic reading 
that was not representative in any way 
of the actual transcript. This is the 
same individual who promised us we 
would get to interview and depose the 
whistleblower because where this en-
gine got started is with the whistle-
blower. That never happened. 
So along the way, as witnesses were 
subpoenaed to talk and the President 
exercised his executive privilege, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
said that we do not have time to go to 
the court and determine whether that 
executive privilege is being exerted in 
an overly broad manner, whether we 
can narrow it, or whether it is com-
pletely inappropriate. We just don’t 
have time. Because do you know why? 
We have got to impeach this President 
tomorrow because it is as if he is an ab-
solute destructive force and an imme-
diate danger to this Republic. 
The reality is they got their vote, 
and here we sit. Here we sit, a total of 
27 days since the day of the vote. That 
day was there. We were told it was 
going to go tomorrow. My colleague 
from Virginia has very ably explained 
that there is a distinction between in-
forming the Senate procedurally and 
having the vote on House managers. 
But the point he was making, and I 
wish to also join in, is this: you simply 
have seen a process that has been de-
void of the normal rules of precedent in 
this House. 
When 
we 
see 
these 
amorphous 
charges, these articles, passed by this 
body, it tells you two things that make 
this a supreme danger to the Republic 
going forward. All I am pointing to is 
what my colleague from Florida said, 
is the danger that the impeachment 
process will be misused for political 
purposes. 
And that is this: Number one, process 
matters. Process always matters. It is 
why we have these wonderful folks who 
sit in front of us to make sure that we 
are following the rules of the House 
and to make sure that we are following 
the rules of precedent. It is not unlike 
international law, quite frankly, where 
all you are relying on is precedent, and 
you just change it very simply. If you 
don’t have those rules and you don’t 
have integrity to the rules, then the 
minority rights are abused. 
When the minority rights are abused 
in this place, that means the right of 
representation of tens of millions of 
Americans is diffused and abused. So 
you have that problem. 
Then you have the fundamental idea 
of trying to impeach on things like ob-
struction of Congress. Well, I just told 
you how Congress was not obstructed. 
Congress had a remedy. You cannot 
have obstruction if you have a remedy. 
The remedy was to go to the other 
branch and resolve it. They chose not 
to. 
These are the two problems in the 
most virulent way. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO RICHARD 
BARNETT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. 
DAVIS) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the op-
portunity to come to the floor at this 
time. 
I come to pay tribute to a person who 
is not easy to describe. As a matter of 
fact, he has been called many things, 
has been many things, and will always 
be many things. As a matter of fact, 
his name is Richard Barnett. He held 
no title and he held no office. As a mat-
ter of fact, he never ran for public of-
fice, to my knowledge. But he probably 
helped more individuals get elected to 
judgeships in Cook County than any-
body in the history of the county. 
As a matter of fact, he also happened 
to have been the manager of my first 
campaign for public office which was 
about 40 years ago. After the campaign 
was over, he went into the hospital. He 
had taken ill but would not go into the 
hospital until after the election was 
done. He finally did go after we had 
won, and he looked as though he only 
weighed about 90 pounds which means 
that he was just that sick, he was just 
that ill. But he bounced back and went 
back to work at his actual job which 
was that of a postal clerk.

He went back and worked until re-
tirement. Then he became very ac-
tively engaged in the election of Har-
old Washington for mayor of the city of 
Chicago. He took a job and worked for 
the city until he quit that after Harold 
had passed away, because he really was 
not looking for a job or didn’t want a 
job. 
He became significantly important 
because we have all heard the term po-
litical machine. We don’t hear it as 
much now as we did in the past, but po-
litical machines have been described in 
many different ways, sometimes good, 
sometimes not so good, and sometimes 
bad. 
b 1545 
One definition that people generally 
accept as being fairly common is that a 
political machine is a political group 
in which an authoritative leader or 
small group commands the support of a 
core of supporters and businesses, usu-
ally campaign workers, who receive re-
wards for their efforts. The machine is 
based on the ability of the boss or 
group to get out the vote for their can-
didate on election day. 
The term ‘‘political machine’’ dates 
back to the 20th century in the United 
States. In the late 19th century, large 
cities in the United States—Boston, 
Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New 
York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and oth-
ers—were accused of forming, building, 
and making use of political machines. 
Chicago, being one of those, emerged 
as one of the big cities with a strong 
political machine. The machine was 
known to totally dominate and control 
all the machinery of government, espe-
cially in the immigrant and Black 
communities. 
When I came to Chicago in 1961, Chi-
cago was seriously segregated, as it is 
today, and seriously politically orga-
nized, much more than it is today. 
These were what was called the move-
ment years. 
This is the period when Dr. Martin 
Luther King came into Chicago. This is 
the period when we experienced the 
War on Poverty, great efforts to reduce 
and work on some of the issues plagu-
ing individuals who were at the bottom 
of the socioeconomic scale. 
That 
was 
when 
I 
met 
Richard 
Barnett. He was part of a small group 
of activists who felt and believed that 
the machine could be defeated. 
Notables like Leon Despres, Richard 
Barnett, himself, and others worked in 
ways to try to undercut the power and 
influence. People were meeting a great 
deal in Chicago, and there were meet-
ings all the time, almost every day. We 
were young activists and would almost 
be looking for meetings. 
People would talk about everything. 
They talked about race issues. They 
would talk about poverty. They would 
talk about the need for programs. But 
very seldom would they talk about 
electoral politics. 
Richard was one of the persons who 
would, and he kind of checked people 
out at the meetings. When there was a 
campaign going on, he might call you 
up. 
I never will forget, he called me and 
asked me if I would be a poll watcher. 
I said, what am I going to watch? Am 
I going to watch the polls? 
He said, well, that is not exactly 
what it means, because I really did not 
know. I mean, I would go to the meet-
ings and all. 
He said: No, you are going to go and 
watch to make sure that the election is 
fair. 
And I am trying to figure out how in 
the world can I make sure that an elec-
tion is fair by watching the poll. 
The next time he called, he says: 
Would you like to be a LEAP judge? 
I said: Leap judge? Does that mean I 
am going to jump over somebody? 
He laughed and said: Well, that is not 
quite exactly what that means either. 
That means ‘‘legal elections in all pre-
cincts,’’ and we are working to try to 
make sure that the elections are fair 
and that the votes are accurate. 
That was Richard. Richard always 
had a telephone book and a bunch of 
names, and he was most effective with 
that. 
I also say that it was him and some 
other folk who got me to run for the 
city council. I had no intention of run-
ning, but I did agree to be chairman of 
a committee to help find a candidate. 
But we couldn’t find anybody; nobody 
would run. We broke up the committee, 
and I ran into the person we were going 
to run against. He started to do what 
we call sell wolf tickets. 
He says: You guys have been talking 
about what you are going to do to me, 
and you can’t even find a candidate. 
I went home that evening and said to 
my wife: I think I am going to run for 
the city council. 
She said: Who, you? 
I said: Well, yeah, me. 
She said: You can’t run for no city 
council. You are not even a precinct 
captain. 
And I said: Well, I didn’t know you 
had to be one to run. 
At any rate, I called Richard, and 
Richard said: Well, if you decide you 
are going to run, I will help you. 
That is exactly what he did, and he 
has been helping me ever since. He has 
been helping me every time I run. He 
has been helping other people every 
time they run. Never to my knowledge 
have I known him to get 1 cent for 
working a campaign or working in any-
body’s campaign. 
He became sort of an icon to those of 
us who believe in what we called inde-
pendent politics, meaning independent 
of bossism, independent of not being 
able to make up your own mind and 
make your own decisions. 
I guess when I went to his funeral on 
Saturday, the individuals who were 
there, they were just down the line, 
down the line. I think some of what I 
experienced with Richard, I am sure 
that you experienced some of it also. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted that 
Mr. RUSH came over to join me as we 
talk about this community icon from 
our city. I might also add that BOBBY’s 
district was the first district that an 
African American won after African 
Americans were all put out or left or 
didn’t come back at the end of the 18th 
century. 
Madam Speaker, I yield time to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH), 
the Representative from the First Dis-
trict in Illinois. 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, the dynamic part of 
the dynamic duo, my brother who is 
known far and wide as being a voice of 
inspiration, a voice of reason, and a 
mighty voice of valor, my friend and 
colleague for many, many years, Con-
gressman DANNY
K. DAVIS
from the 
great Seventh Congressional District 
in the State of Illinois. 
I thank Congressman DAVIS for hon-
oring the legacy of his friend and mine, 
Mr. Richard Barnett, who was a true 
visionary, whose outstanding efforts 
helped bring Chicago’s local govern-
ment and the State of Illinois’ govern-
ment closer to the people who con-
sented to be governed, to the people 
who know governments are supposed to 
serve. 
Madam Speaker, Richard Barnett 
was a man of enormous talents, skills, 
and abilities. Integral to his vision, 
though, was a focus on enfranchising 
those who had been intentionally ex-
cluded from the political process by 
Chicago’s political elite. 
Richard was a courageous voice for 
the left out, for the locked out, and for 
those who were forced to live on the 
margins of political power in the city 
of Chicago. 
I guess the clearest example of this 
was the critical role that Richard 
Barnett played in the election of Chi-
cago’s first African American mayor, 
Harold Washington, and the defeat of 
Chicago’s 
vaunted 
Democratic 
ma-
chine. 
But we can’t look at one election and 
summarize Richard’s contribution by 
just one election. Richard Barnett’s 
transformative role in Chicago politics 
would come years earlier, following the 
untimely assassination of my dear 
friend and colleague, Fred Hampton. 
The story goes that after then-Cook 
County State’s Attorney Edward V. 
Hanrahan led the political assassina-
tion of Hampton, who was chairman of 
the Illinois chapter of the Black Pan-
ther Party, Richard Barnett encour-
aged all African Americans, all minori-
ties, all good people in the city of Chi-
cago, all those who cared about civil 
rights, law and order, and justice in 
our city, to refuse to vote for Edward 
Hanrahan in the upcoming general 
election. 
b 1600 
That was the election in 1972. This 
was in spite of the fact that Richard 
was a Democrat, and most of the Afri-
can American community was Demo-
crat. We vote with the Democratic ma-
chine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H236 
January 14, 2020 
We refused to just be ignored and 
disrespected, 
and 
we 
defeated 
the 
Democratic machine in Chicago in the 
election 
of 
1972 
for 
Cook 
County 
State’s attorney but, for the first time 
in the history of the city of Chicago, 
elected a Republican as the State’s at-
torney of Cook County, Bernard J. 
Carey. The evil Edward V. Hanrahan 
would lose the general election, mostly 
because of Richard Barnett’s political 
acumen and activism. 
This defeat by the Cook County 
Democratic machine would ignite a po-
litical awakening in Chicago that 
would begin with the 1983 election of 
Harold Washington. But it would go 
even beyond that and would go on to 
inspire African Americans all across 
the country to run for public office, in-
cluding yours truly. 
Barnett’s work elected strong polit-
ical voices, committed political voices, 
dedicated, passionate political voices 
up and down the ballot, year in and 
year out. Richard Barnett helped elect 
scores of members of the city council, 
aldermen, 
appellate 
court 
judges, 
judges in the circuit court, State rep-
resentatives, State senators, Members 
of Congress, other elected officials. 
I guess, personally, for me, Richard 
Barnett’s legacy was centered around 
his strategic and informed advice. I 
mean, you would just marvel, sitting in 
a political education class, where Rich-
ard Barnett would take a group of—not 
an organization, but just well-meaning 
individuals from different places, some 
Ph.D.’s and some GEDs and no Ds, 
bring them into a room, spend time 
telling them about not only how to win 
an election, but why they should win 
an election. 
Barnett would tell us how to use the 
very tactics that precinct captains had 
been using for decades and use it 
against those same precinct captains. 
He would teach us how to canvass an 
election. 
The first time I ever heard anything 
about a canvass, it flowed from Rich-
ard Barnett’s lips: how to take a poll 
sheet and go from house to house and 
building to building and floor to floor 
asking people would they vote for your 
candidate, and then summarize that by 
either putting a plus or a minus. 
If they were going to vote for your 
candidate, they were a plus voter; if 
they were going to vote against your 
candidate, then they were a minus 
voter; and if they were undecided, then 
you put a zero. And you just didn’t stop 
there. The minuses, you left them 
alone, but the zeroes, you went back to 
them. 
Richard Barnett told us all of that 
every day from the announcement to 
the decision day in an election, and 
that was election day, and how you had 
to really be prepared for election day 
because, as Congressman DAVIS indi-
cated, we didn’t have poll watchers in 
the polls, passing 100 feet outside of the 
polls. If you didn’t go and locate your 
plus voters and get them to the polls, 
then you would not win that election. 
So Richard Barnett taught us the 
strategy and the discipline of how to 
win an election. 
Barnett shaped a lot of community 
leaders, 
politicians, 
and 
activists 
through his example and through those 
political education classes. The list is 
prominent, exalted, endless: Congress-
man DANNY K. DAVIS; yours truly, Con-
gressman BOBBY L. RUSH; Congressman 
CHUY
GARCI´A; 
former 
Congressman 
Luis Gutierrez. We all sat at Richard 
Barnett’s knee and learned how to win 
elections from this eminent political 
strategist and teacher. 
Even Barnett’s charisma, his char-
acter, his teaching transcended into 
the mindset, the strategies of the 
former President of the United States. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, the gentleman just 
talked about Representative GARCI´A, 
who has just joined us and come in. I 
think we have got about 5 minutes left. 
Mr. RUSH. Certainly, Congressman 
DAVIS. I just wanted to add my voice to 
the Richard Barnett story that the Na-
tion must know about. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
GARCI´A). We call him ‘‘Chuy’’ in Chi-
cago, but everybody knows him that 
way. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to be on the 
floor this afternoon and to join the 
gentlemen in honoring the life and the 
memory and the legacy of Richard 
Barnett. 
Richard was a neighbor of Chicago’s 
Lawndale community. He lived just a 
few blocks from my house. He worked 
as a U.S. Postal Service employee prior 
to his retirement in 1982. He was very 
devoted to his wife and his children and 
was involved in his local community— 
in the schools, in the parks, and in the 
churches—and every aspect of civic life 
as a good community resident. 
But Richard was also a mentor to me 
in my earliest days as a candidate for 
political office. From the early 1980s, 
when I first stepped up, I learned how 
to organize in communities of color so 
that they could become politically em-
powered at the local, State, and Fed-
eral level. 
He helped enrich my understanding 
of the Voting Rights Act and how the 
Federal 
law 
could 
help 
Chicago’s 
Latino communities in the early 1980s 
elect people to Chicago’s city council, 
to the State general assembly, to the 
Cook County board, and, yes, even to 
the Federal Government, a position 
that I can say I hold, in part, because 
of the mentorship of Richard Barnett. 
Richard was deeply committed to dis-
mantling the infamously corrupt and 
discriminatory and exclusionary Chi-
cago political machine with new polit-
ical movements that were rooted in 
Chicago neighborhoods, and he wanted 
to usher in an era of equitable and hon-
est government. 
Richard was instrumental in bringing 
together multiracial, multiethnic, and 
faith coalitions across Chicago to ad-
vance progressive public policies. 
He helped me in my elections to the 
Chicago City Council, to the Illinois 
Senate, to the Cook County board, and 
to Congress. I will be eternally grateful 
for all of his assistance and mentorship 
and friendship over nearly a period of 
four decades in the city of Chicago. 
Richard was a true son of his commu-
nity, his people, and people all over Il-
linois and across the country because 
he sought to empower and to give a 
voice to the people who were voiceless. 
Long live Richard Barnett.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2020 
No. 8 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You are high and lifted 
up. Deliver us from estrangement or 
dissension. Teach our lawmakers to 
disagree with respect, civility, and hu-
mility. Lord, lead them into a deeper 
reverence for You and one another as 
they remember that patriots reside on 
both sides of the aisle. May our Sen-
ators celebrate the pleasure You re-
ceive when colleagues of faith dwell to-
gether in unity. Let the words of their 
mouths and the meditations of their 
hearts receive Your divine approval. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 1 minute in morning busi-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TAIWAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as President pro tempore of the U.S. 
Senate, I want to recognize democracy 
working in Taiwan. 
On Saturday, the 23 million proud 
people of Taiwan exercised their demo-
cratic right to select their own leaders. 
I congratulate President Tsai on her 
reelection. I would also like to take 
this moment to congratulate all Tai-
wanese for being a shining light amidst 
dark times in other parts of East Asia. 
All of us remember what has been 
going on in Hong Kong for the last sev-
eral months as they try to exercise just 
rights that the Chinese Government 
gave them in 1997, when they signed an 
agreement with the British Govern-
ment turning back Hong Kong to 
China, and they would have the rights 
for the next 50 years to have the same 
democratic principles they had under 
the British Empire. 
Despite continued intimidation by 
the Chinese Communist Party across 
the Taiwan Strait, this proud island 
stood up to protect its democracy and 
sovereignty. That is exemplified by the 
election Saturday. 
Let us all congratulate the people of 
Taiwan for their remarkable accom-
plishment and continue to work in this 
Chamber to strengthen U.S.-Taiwan re-
lations. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
tomorrow will be 4 weeks—4 weeks— 
since House Democrats impeached the 
President of the United States with 
purely partisan support. 
Speaker PELOSI and Chairman SCHIFF 
did not wait to fill out the factual 
record. They did not even wait to see 
their own subpoenas through the legal 
system. They plowed ahead for two rea-
sons: They said impeachment was too 
urgent to wait—too urgent to wait— 
and they said they had already proven 
their case. 
But since then, House Democrats 
have spent 4 weeks contradicting both 
of those claims. They spent 4 weeks 
demonstrating through their actions 
that impeachment is actually not that 
urgent—not that urgent—and they do 
not actually have much confidence in 
their case. 
An arbitrary 4-week delay does not 
show urgency. These demands for the 
Senate to precommit to reopening the 
House investigation do not show con-
fidence. There is a reason why the 
House inquiry that led to President 
Nixon’s resignation took 14 months of 
hearings in addition to the separate 
special prosecutor. There is a reason 
why the Clinton impeachment inquiry 
drew on years of prior investigation 
and mountains of testimony from first-
hand fact witnesses. That is because 
both of those Houses of Representa-
tives knew they had to prove their 
case—prove their case before submit-
ting it to the Senate for judgment. 
Both situations involved legal battles 
over executive privilege and extensive 
litigation, both times not after a trial 
had been handed to the Senate but be-
forehand. When the cases were actually 
being compiled, there were mountains 
of evidence, mountains of testimony, 
and long legal battles over privilege. 
None of this discovery took place over 
here in the Senate. 
The 
Constitution 
gives 
the 
sole 
power of impeachment to the House. If 
the House majority wants to impeach a 
President, the ball is in their court, 
but they have to do the work. They 
have to prove their case. Nothing— 
nothing in our history or our Constitu-
tion says a House majority can pass 
what amounts to a half-baked censure 
resolution and then insist that the 
Senate fill in the blanks. There is no 
constitutional exception for a House 
majority with a short attention span. 
I think everyone knows this process 
has not been some earnest, factfinding 
mission with House Democrats fol-
lowing each thread wherever it leads. 
The Speaker of the House did not re-
luctantly decide to impeach after pour-
ing over secondhand impressions of

civil servants. This was a predeter-
mined political conclusion. Members of 
her conference had been publicly prom-
ising it literally for years. 
That 
is 
why 
the 
investigation 
stopped long before the House had 
come anywhere near proving what they 
allege. They pulled the plug early be-
cause the facts were never the point. 
They were never the point. The point 
was to check a political box. 
For goodness’ sake, the very morning 
after the House’s historic vote, Speak-
er PELOSI literally chastised reporters 
for asking too many questions about 
impeachment. She tried to change the 
subject to economic policy. She said: 
Any other questions? . . . Anybody want to 
talk about the SALT tax. . . . I’m not going 
to answer any more questions on this— 
Referring to impeachment. 
Really? Really? You impeach a Presi-
dent of the United States, and the very 
next morning, there is nothing to see 
here? Does that sound like the Speaker 
of the House really thinks the survival 
of the Republic is on the line? Does 
anyone really think that if Democrats 
truly believe the President of the 
United States was a criminal who is 
imperiling our country, they would 
have abandoned the search for evidence 
because they didn’t want to make time 
for due process; that they would have 
pulled the plug on the investigation 
just because it sounded good to finish 
by Christmas; that they would have de-
layed the trial for months while they 
test-drove new talking points; that 
they would have been trying to change 
the subject 12 hours after the vote? 
I cannot say what Democrats do and 
do not really believe, but they cer-
tainly do not seem to display the ur-
gency or the seriousness you would ex-
pect from people who actually thought 
they had proven the President should 
be removed. 
On 
television 
last 
weekend, 
the 
Speaker bragged that ‘‘this President 
is impeached for life,’’ regardless of 
what the Senate does—regardless of 
what the Senate does, as if the ulti-
mate verdict were sort of an after-
thought. 
Likewise, the Senate Democratic 
leader recently said that as long as he 
can try to use the trial process to hurt 
some Republicans’ reelection chances, 
‘‘it’s a win-win.’’ That is what this is 
all about. The Democratic leader just 
laid it right out there in case anybody 
had any doubt. 
What a revealing admission. Forget 
about the fate of the Presidency. For-
get about the Constitution. As long as 
the process helps Democrats’ political 
fortunes, our Democratic colleagues 
call it a ‘‘win-win.’’ Do these sound 
like leaders who really believe we are 
in a constitutional crisis, one that re-
quires the most severe remedy in our 
entire system of government? Does it 
sound like that? 
Here is how deep we have come into 
bizarro world. The latest Democratic 
talking point is, if the Senate conducts 
a trial based on what the House itself 
looked at, we will be engaged in a 
coverup. Did you get that? Unless the 
Senate steps outside of our lane and 
takes it upon ourselves to supplement 
the House case, it is a coverup? 
Do they think the entire country has 
forgotten what they were saying just a 
couple of days ago? We heard over and 
over that the House case, on its own, 
was totally damming and convincing. 
That is what they were saying a few 
days ago. 
Clearly, a majority of the House felt 
that it was sufficient to impeach, and a 
number of Senate Democrats were 
happy to prejudge the case publicly and 
suggest the House had proven enough 
for removal. 
But now, all of a sudden, the story 
has reversed. Now, we hardly know 
anything. Now, the investigation is 
just beginning. Now, what the House 
has produced is so weak that they are 
calling their own investigation a cover-
up. Who would be the author of this 
coverup—Chairman SCHIFF? 
We have arrived at a simple con-
tradiction. Two things cannot both be 
true. House Democrats’ case cannot si-
multaneously be so robust that it was 
enough to impeach in the first place 
but also so weak that the Senate needs 
to go fishing. If the existing case is 
strong, there is no need for the judge 
and the jury to reopen the investiga-
tion. 
If the existing case is weak, House 
Democrats should not have impeached 
in the first place. I think I am begin-
ning to understand why the Speaker 
wanted to change the subject to tax 
policy. Unfortunately, no matter how 
irresponsibly this has been handled 
across the Capitol, impeachment is not 
a political game, and the U.S. Senate 
will not treat it like one. 
A House majority fueled by political 
animus may have started this with fri-
volity, but it will fall to the Senate—to 
the Senate—to end it with seriousness 
and sobriety. It will fall to us to do 
what the Founders intended: to take 
the long view, to move beyond partisan 
passions, and to do what the long-term 
good of our institution and our Nation 
demands. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
every day brings more repudiation of 
the conventional wisdom of the Demo-
cratic foreign policy establishment, 
breathlessly—breathlessly—amplified 
by the mainstream media, that the 
strike on Soleimani would unite Ira-
nians behind the regime. Remember, 
that is what they were all saying, that 
the strike on Soleimani would unite 
Iranians behind the regime. Proud Ira-
nians continue, however, to take to the 
streets not to rage against America or 
Israel but to vent their frustration 
against the corrupt, theocratic regime 
that has led Iran down a ruinous path. 
I spoke about these protests before 
the strike on Soleimani, and I will con-
tinue to speak out about them. I have 
long believed the United States should 
care about human rights and democ-
racy, whether in Russia, China, Hong 
Kong, Burma, Cuba, Venezuela, Af-
ghanistan, Syria, or Iran. The pro-
motion of human rights and the de-
fense of democracy should not nec-
essarily be the driving force of our for-
eign policy, but it should be an impor-
tant component. 
I ask my Democratic colleagues who 
share this view to set aside their ha-
tred for Donald Trump—even just for a 
moment—and to step back to look at 
what has been happening across Iran 
for years: the repression of women, the 
persecution of ethnic and religious mi-
norities, and the brutal suppression of 
dissent. 
Was the Obama administration right 
to meet the 2009 Green Revolution with 
silence? 
Consider the story of Iran’s only fe-
male Olympic medalist, who this week 
defected—defected—from Iran and re-
quested asylum; or the Iranian state 
TV broadcasters who quit, apologizing 
to the public for years of lying on be-
half of the mullahs; or the innocent 
protesters who are being killed and 
wounded by agents of the state. 
These are well-known realities. They 
were well known when, 12 days ago, the 
United States took the most dangerous 
terrorist 
off 
the 
battlefield, 
but 
mystifyingly, many voices here in 
Washington and the media sought to 
blame the escalating tensions in the re-
gion on President Trump. 
We heard from leading Democrats 
that 
the 
operation 
to 
eliminate 
Soleimani was one of the administra-
tion’s ‘‘needless provocations’’—need-
less provocations. We heard that the 
cycle of violence was America’s respon-
sibility. All of this—all of it—flies in 
the face of the reasonable analysis 
some of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle were offering before— 
before—Donald Trump became Presi-
dent. 
In 
2007, 
30 
Democratic 
Senators 
joined 
Republicans 
to 
support 
an 
amendment warning of the need to pre-
vent ‘‘Iran from turning Shia militia 
extremists in Iraq into a Hezbollah- 
like force that could serve its interests 
inside Iraq, including by overwhelming, 
subverting, or coopting institutions of 
the legitimate government of Iraq.’’ 
That was back in 2007, with 30 Demo-
crats. 
Few more prescient warnings have 
been pronounced by this body, but, un-
fortunately, it went unheeded by the 
Obama administration, which withdrew 
U.S. forces from Iraq, effectively aban-
doning it to Soleimani and his proxies. 
As recently as 2015, the Democratic 
leader warned that the JCPAO failed to 
address Iran’s destabilizing malign ac-
tivities and that Iran would use its 
windfall to ‘‘redouble its efforts to cre-
ate even more trouble in the Middle 
East and, perhaps, beyond.’’ That was 
the Democratic leader in 2015. 
Senator MENENDEZ hit the nail on 
the head as well. He warned: ‘‘If there

is a fear of war in the region, it will be 
fueled by Iran and its proxies and exac-
erbated by an agreement that allows 
Iran to possess an industrial-sized nu-
clear program and enough money in 
sanctions relief to significantly con-
tinue to fund its hegemonic intentions 
throughout 
the 
region.’’ 
Senator 
MENENDEZ. 
So many of our Democratic col-
leagues understood all this quite clear-
ly when a Democrat occupied the 
White House, and it came true. It came 
true. Iran’s aggression only accelerated 
after the Obama administration’s deal. 
The question for us is not whom to 
blame. That much is clear. The ques-
tion is what to do about it. 
As Iran’s aggression became focused 
on the United States, as the risk to our 
personnel and interests grew, after 
months of repeated warnings, Presi-
dent Trump took action. I am glad the 
strike against Soleimani has provided 
some 
justice—some 
justice—to 
his 
countless victims, hundreds of Ameri-
cans and many more across the Middle 
East. 
We don’t yet know if Soleimani will 
prove irreplaceable, but his death will 
significantly disrupt Iran’s death ma-
chine and will change Iran’s long-held 
misconception that they could literally 
get away with the murder of Ameri-
cans without a meaningful response. 
President Trump’s strategy seems to 
have reestablished deterrence. 
The Senate risks jeopardizing what 
we have gained with this strike if it 
ties the military’s hands and tells Iran 
that we have no stomach for this. 
America can hardly be defeated on the 
battlefield, but we can be defeated at 
home on the political front. We can 
allow ourselves to become divided and 
play into the hands of our adversaries. 
Our divisions at home are significant. 
Let us not allow them to pollute our 
judgment on foreign affairs. Let’s not 
make our adversaries’ lives easier by 
tying our military’s hands.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the House of Representatives has im-
peached the President for a very seri-
ous offense: coercing a foreign leader 
into interfering in our elections, using 
the powers of the Presidency, the most 
powerful public office in the Nation, to 
benefit himself—to actually influence 
the election, which should be decided 
by American citizens, not by a foreign 
power. When debating the impeach-
ment clause of the Constitution, the 
Founders worried about foreign cap-
itals having undue influence over our 
country. Hamilton, writing in the Fed-
eralist Papers, described impeachable 
offenses as abuses or violations of some 
public trust. 
In the impeachment of President 
Trump, the question the Senate will be 
asked to answer is whether the Presi-
dent did, in fact, abuse his public trust 
and, by doing so, invite the very for-
eign influence the Founders feared 
would be a corruption of our democ-
racy. To answer that question, to de-
cide whether the President merits ac-
quittal and removal from office, the 
Senate must conduct a fair trial. A fair 
trial has witnesses. A fair trial has rel-
evant documents as a part of the 
record. A fair trial seeks the truth—no 
more, no less. 
That is why Democrats have asked to 
call four fact witnesses and subpoena 
three specific sets of relevant docu-
ments related to the President’s mis-
conduct with Ukraine. At the moment, 
my Republican colleagues are opposing 
these witnesses and documents, but 
they can’t seem to find a real reason 
why. Most are unwilling to argue that 
witnesses shouldn’t come before the 
Senate. They can only support delay-
ing the decision until most of the trial 
is over, like a magic eight ball that 
keeps saying: Ask again later. 
The most the Republican leader can 
do is smear our request as some par-
tisan fishing expedition intended to 
damage the President, but the leader 
himself has warned that the witnesses 
we have requested might not help the 
House managers’ case against the 
President. He is right about that. 
These are the President’s top advisers. 
They are appointed by him, vetted by 
him. They work with him. 
We don’t know what those witnesses 
will say or what the documents will re-
veal. They could hurt the President’s 
case or they could help the President’s 
case. We don’t know. 
We know one thing. We want the 
truth on something as weighty and pro-
found as an impeachment trial. Does 
Leader MCCONNELL want the truth? Do 
Senate Republicans want the truth? 
I would remind the leader that our 
request for witnesses and documents is 
very much in line with the Senate’s 
history. The Republican leader keeps 
citing precedent. Well, here is prece-
dent, Mr. Leader. There have been two 
Presidential impeachment trials in his-
tory. Both—both—had witnesses. The 
trial of Andrew Johnson had 41 wit-
nesses. There have been 16 completed 
impeachment trials in the Senate’s en-
tire history. In every one, except one, 
the trial in 1799 of Senator William 
Blount, which was dismissed on juris-
dictional grounds, every Senate im-
peachment trial in history has included 
witnesses. 
You want precedent? Precedent says 
witnesses overwhelmingly. 
The long arc of history casts a shad-
ow on the proceedings we are about to 
undertake. It suggests something obvi-
ous—that the Senate has always be-
lieved trials were about evidence and 
getting the truth. Of the 16 impeach-
ment trials, 15 had witnesses and 1 was 
dismissed early. Do Senate Republicans 
want to break that lengthy historical 
precedent by conducting the first im-
peachment trial of a President in his-
tory with no witnesses? Let me ask 
that question again. This is weighty. 
This is vital. This is about the Repub-
lic. Do Senate Republicans want to 
break the lengthy historical precedent 
that said witnesses should be at in im-
peachment trial by conducting the first 
impeachment trial of the President in 
history—in history, since 1789—with no 
witnesses? 
I ask that question because that 
seems to be where the Republican lead-
er wants us to be headed. The Repub-
lican leader has designed a schedule for 
a Senate trial that might—might— 
have us vote on witnesses and docu-
ments after the presentations from 
both sides have been concluded—the ju-
dicial equivalent of putting the cart 
before the horse. Of course, Leader 
MCCONNELL
has made no guarantee 
that he will support voting on wit-
nesses and documents at that time— 
only that supposedly he will be open to 
the idea. 
I want my Republican colleagues to 
bear in mind that if we consider wit-
nesses at a later date, it could extend 
the trial by several days, maybe sev-
eral weeks, as witnesses did during the 
Clinton trial. 
Leader MCCONNELL
has said that 
after the arguments are made, we 
should vote and move on. Do my Re-
publican 
colleagues 
really 
believe 
Leader MCCONNELL will have an open 
mind about witnesses at a later date 
when they might extend the trial much 
longer than he wants? I am not in the 
prediction business, but I can bet that

when the time comes, Leader MCCON-
NELL
will say that we have heard 
enough, that the trial shouldn’t drag 
on any longer, that the Senate doesn’t 
need witnesses and documents, and 
that we should, just as he once said 
‘‘vote and move on.’’ 
Before Senate Republicans are so 
quick to reject the Democratic pro-
posal for a limited list of relevant wit-
nesses and documents, I want them to 
consider that our proposal would save 
the Senate time. We want to confront 
the issue now, not be forced to extend 
the trial later. We want both the House 
managers and the White House defense 
counsel to have time to incorporate the 
testimony of witnesses into their pres-
entations. That is the proper way to 
proceed. That is what happens at 
trials—collect all the evidence at the 
beginning, not at the end. 
All we are asking is for the Presi-
dent’s own men, his appointees, to 
come forward and tell their side of the 
story. The American people want a fair 
trial in the Senate. The American peo-
ple know that a trial without witnesses 
and documents is not a real trial; it is 
a sham trial. And the American people 
will be able to tell the difference be-
tween a fair hearing of the facts and a 
coverup. 
IRAN 
Madam President, on Iran, the Sen-
ate will soon consider Senator KAINE’s 
War Powers Resolution, which would 
prevent further hostilities with Iran 
without congressional approval. It is a 
crucial vote that will correctly assert 
this body’s constitutional authority 
over matters of war and peace, and it is 
certainly timely. 
The past few weeks have highlighted 
the President’s impulsive, erratic, and 
often reckless foreign policy, the con-
sequences of which have made Ameri-
cans less safe and unnecessarily put 
our Armed Forces in harm’s way. From 
North Korea, to Syria, to Russia, it is 
impossible to say the world is a safer 
place 
today 
than 
when 
President 
Trump took office, and it is very pos-
sible to say that President Trump, by 
his impulsive, erratic, and ego-driven 
actions, has made things worse. 
With respect to Iran, the President’s 
recent actions have increased the risk 
of further hostilities in the Middle 
East. The President campaigned on 
getting the United States out of ‘‘end-
less wars’’ in the Middle East, but the 
President has deployed thousands more 
U.S. troops in the Middle East with 
hardly an explanation to Congress or 
to the American people. 
I have long been concerned that the 
President’s chaotic, impulsive deci-
sionmaking might stumble us into war. 
With Iran, like with many other places 
around the globe, the President’s pol-
icy has brought us closer to the kind of 
endless war the President promised we 
would avoid. 
It is past time for Congress to place 
a check on this President. On matters 
of war and peace, congressional over-
sight and congressional prerogatives 
are not optional. I urge my colleagues 
on both sides to vote in favor of the 
Kaine resolution. 
Senator SANDERS also has a bill that 
would deny funding for a war with Iran, 
of which I am a proud cosponsor. The 
Senate should consider that legislation 
as well. As the situation with Iran con-
tinues to evolve, the administration 
must come back and brief Congress on 
all major developments, troop deploy-
ments, and long-term strategy in the 
region. 
CHINA 
Madam President, finally, on China, 
tomorrow the United States will com-
plete a signing ceremony for the so- 
called phase one trade agreement with 
China. After 18 months of negotiations, 
the phase one deal is remarkable for 
how little it achieves at an enormous 
price. 
President Trump has agreed to scale 
back some tariffs on Chinese goods in 
exchange for temporary assurances 
that China will increase its purchase of 
U.S. exports over the next few years, 
particularly in agriculture. 
For all the effort and turmoil over 
the past few years, the deal President 
Trump 
will 
sign 
tomorrow 
hardly 
seems to advance the United States 
past square one. It fails to address the 
deep structural inequalities in the 
trade relationship between China and 
the United States. 
For the past decade, China has stolen 
American 
intellectual 
property 
through forced technology transfers of 
our companies and through outright 
cyber theft. The President’s phase one 
deal doesn’t even address this issue. 
China has routinely subsidized its most 
important domestic industries. Not 
just labor-intensive industries but even 
industries like Huawei are subsidized 
to gain unfair advantage over Amer-
ican companies. China has dumped 
goods illegally into our markets. It has 
manipulated 
its 
currency 
to 
keep 
prices low. The President’s phase one 
deal doesn’t address any of these 
issues. 
Not only does this deal fail to make 
any meaningful progress toward ending 
China’s most flagrant abuses, what it 
does achieve on the agricultural side 
may well be a day late and a dollar 
short. China has already made long- 
term contracts with other producers of 
soybeans and other goods in places like 
Argentina and Brazil. American farm-
ers have already lost billions over the 
last 2 years, watched their markets dis-
appear, and too many American farms 
have gone bankrupt in the time that it 
took President Trump to reach this 
deal. 
I have publicly praised the President 
when he is tough on China, at some po-
litical cost. I have said he has had bet-
ter instincts on China than previous 
administrations. Few politicians have 
been talking about securing real re-
forms to China’s economic policies 
longer than I have. But I fear that with 
an election around the corner, the 
President is taking the easy way out— 
settling for a weak deal that will cost 
American businesses, American farm-
ers, and American workers for years 
and years to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
IRAN 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, this 
week we expect to vote on a War Pow-
ers Resolution related to operations in 
Iran. I am pleased that the President’s 
demonstration of strength has restored 
our position of credible deterrence. 
Some have challenged that the Presi-
dent’s action was escalatory, but the 
reality is that Iran had become in-
creasingly bold. The United States re-
sponded in self-defense, and, as the 
President has said, it appears that Iran 
is standing down. 
Hopefully 
Iran’s 
tragic 
error 
in 
shooting down a civilian passenger 
plane has served as a sobering check on 
the regime’s activities. We have seen 
thousands of Iranians rallying in the 
streets in recent days protesting the 
bringing down of the passenger plane 
and calling for change. I hope the peo-
ple of Iran are able to organize and 
demonstrate in safety and that their 
hopes and prayers for change are an-
swered. 
Soleimani’s death provides an oppor-
tunity for Iran to rethink its direction, 
to move away from brutally oppressing 
its citizens and fomenting violence 
throughout the Middle East. We should 
encourage such rethinking by con-
tinuing to make it clear through the 
sanctions the President has imposed 
and other measures that we will not 
accept 
Iranian 
aggression 
against 
Americans or our allies. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Madam President, on an issue closer 
to home, at the end of last week, 
Speaker PELOSI
announced that she 
was finally ready to send over the Arti-
cles of Impeachment—the next step in 
a saga that began 3 years ago. That is 
right, on January 20, 2017—Inaugura-
tion Day—the Washington Post ran an 
article entitled ‘‘The campaign to im-
peach President Trump has begun.’’ 
It is important that we not forget 
this. We need to remember how we got 
here. Democrats would like to think 
that this impeachment was the result 
of a high-minded, impartial, thoughtful 
procession. It wasn’t. It was the result 
of a 3-year-long partisan crusade to 
damage or remove this President. 
It is fair to say that the actual im-
peachment 
process 
was 
the 
most 
rushed, most biased, and least impar-
tial impeachment process in history. 
For evidence, look no further than the 
Democrats’ behavior in the wake of the 
impeachment vote. 
Democrats rushed the Articles of Im-
peachment through the House because, 
we were told, it was urgent that the 
President be removed from office. One 
Democrat even said that the House was 
acting hastily because there was ‘‘a 
crime spree in progress.’’ And then 
what did Democrats do? Instead of

S171 
January 14, 2020 
sending the Articles of Impeachment 
over to the Senate so the Senate could 
conduct a trial, Speaker PELOSI and 
the House Democratic caucus sat on 
the articles for close to a month. 
The delay was so flagrantly unjusti-
fied that even Senate Democrats start-
ed to express their impatience with the 
House. ‘‘If it’s serious and urgent, send 
them over.’’ That is a quote from the 
highest ranking Democrat on the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. She went on 
to say: ‘‘If it isn’t, don’t send it over.’’ 
A fair point. But House Democrats 
never really believed in the seriousness 
and urgency of the articles. If they 
had, they would have sent them over to 
the Senate immediately. 
Of course, while Senate Democrats 
have gotten impatient with the House, 
Senate Democrats have also dem-
onstrated a healthy dose of partisan-
ship around the impeachment. 
Senate Republicans have proposed 
modeling the rules for the first phase 
of this impeachment trial on the rules 
that governed the Clinton impeach-
ment trial—rules that were agreed to 
unanimously by Democrats and Repub-
licans at the time—but Senate Demo-
crats are having none of it. These rules 
were eminently fair and, as I said, were 
supported by every single Democrat be-
fore President Clinton’s impeachment 
trial. These rules gave both sides—the 
House impeachment managers and the 
President and his team—an oppor-
tunity to make their case, and they 
gave Senators an opportunity to ques-
tion both sides and only then make a 
determination as to whether additional 
information or witnesses were needed. 
These rules were good enough for 
Democrats and Republicans back then; 
they ought to be good enough for 
Democrats and Republicans today. 
I am glad Speaker PELOSI is finally 
sending over the articles so we can 
move forward with this process and 
then get back to doing the work the 
American people sent us here to do, but 
I am saddened by the damage Demo-
crats have done to the institution and 
the processes of government. 
The overturning of an election—the 
overturning of the American people’s 
choice—is a very serious thing. It is a 
remedy to be wielded only with careful 
deliberation, in the most serious cir-
cumstances. 
The Democrats have spent the past 3 
years treating impeachment not as a 
remedy of last resort but as a way of 
overturning an election where they 
didn’t like the outcome. That is not 
what impeachment was intended to be. 
By hijacking the impeachment process 
for political purposes, Democrats have 
made it clear that they believe election 
outcomes don’t matter and that they 
believe it should be the Democratic 
Party, not the democratic process, that 
decides elections. And that is pro-
foundly disturbing. 
This fall, the American people will 
have a chance to render their verdict 
on the Trump Presidency. In fact, Pres-
idential primary voting begins in just a 
few short weeks. It is a great pity that 
Democrats have sought to preempt the 
next Presidential election with a par-
tisan impeachment process in Wash-
ington, DC. 
I hope we can move beyond this im-
peachment and the hyper-partisanship 
the Democrats have engaged in over 
the past 3 years. This institution 
should be in the business of governing, 
not endlessly trying to overturn an 
election. I hope in the future we can 
keep impeachment as a serious remedy 
for the most serious of crimes, not as a 
political weapon to be used whenever a 
partisan majority in Congress despises 
the occupant in the White House. 
We will do our constitutional duty in 
the Senate over the next few weeks, 
and after that, I look forward to get-
ting back to the business of the Amer-
ican people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Senate as it is currently meeting is in 
the normal course of business, but in 
just a few days, this Senate Chamber 
will change. It will no longer be the 
Senate considering resolutions and leg-
islation; it will be a Senate considering 
an impeachment proceeding. It will be 
a piece of history for those who watch. 
This will be only the third time in the 
history of the United States of Amer-
ica that the Senate will be convening 
for an impeachment proceeding rel-
ative to the President of the United 
States. It is a matter of the most seri-
ous constitutional gravity, and I hope 
all of us as Members of the Senate will 
consider it and approach it that way. 
Under the Constitution, we have a 
unique role as Members of the Senate. 
We are the jurors; we are the jury. 
There are 100 Senators who will decide 
whether the Articles of Impeachment 
should be voted on and whether the im-
peachment of the President of the 
United States should proceed. 
We are also in a unique role under 
the Constitution in that we aren’t just 
jurors sitting silently in the jury box. 
We are also judges in one respect. We 
set up the procedure, the way the trial 
moves forward. 
Before I was elected to Congress, I 
used to practice trial law, and jurors 
had the ultimate word in terms of the 
fate of my clients, but the jurors didn’t 
decide the procedure of the trial. That 
was decided by a judge. When it comes 
to an impeachment proceeding under 
the Constitution, the actual process or 
the procedure of the impeachment trial 
is decided by the jurors, the Senators. 
It is very unusual, but it was a decision 
made by our Founding Fathers to put 
this ultimate test of impeachment in 
the hands of the Senators. 
Why pick the Senate? It could have 
gone to the Supreme Court or some 
other tribunal. Alexander Hamilton 
said that there were two reasons they 
wanted to bring the impeachment trial 
to the floor of the Senate. He said that 
the Senators, by their nature and polit-
ical 
composition, 
would 
be 
‘‘inde-
pendent 
and 
dignified’’—his 
words, 
‘‘independent and dignified.’’ I hope he 
is right. 
I was here 20 years ago during the 
Clinton impeachment trial, and I can 
remember very well how the tempera-
ment and mood and environment on 
the floor of the Senate changed when 
the impeachment proceedings began. 
There was the arrival of the Chief Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court in his judi-
cial role to sit where the current Pre-
siding Officer of the Senate is sitting 
and to preside over the trial. Instantly, 
when you walked into the Chamber and 
saw the Chief Justice, you knew this 
was different. This was a new chal-
lenge. This was being treated dif-
ferently by the Constitution. 
Then, of course, each of us, having 
been sworn in to be Senators rep-
resenting the States that sent us, take 
a separate oath when it comes to our 
responsibilities 
under 
impeachment. 
That oath is fairly routine, but it in-
cludes one phrase that stands out when 
I read it. We swear that we will impart 
‘‘impartial justice’’ as impeachment 
jurors—impartial justice. We hold up 
our hands and swear. We sign the book 
on the desk at the front of the Senate, 
as a matter of history, that we have 
made this oath for impartial justice. 
That is why I have been troubled, as we 
lead up to this impeachment pro-
ceeding, when I hear some of the state-
ments and speeches that have been 
made on the floor of the Senate. 
The Republican leader from Ken-
tucky said very openly several weeks 
ago that he was going to work with the 
President’s defense team to prepare for 
how he would handle the impeachment 
proceedings in the Senate. I understand 
there are some elements of this that 
just make sense that there would be 
conversation with the managers of the 
impeachment as to the procedure to be 
followed. But what we have heard, even 
today, on the floor of the Senate is 
more than just cooperation in setting 
up the workings of the impeachment 
proceeding. What we have heard from 
the Republican majority leader is noth-
ing short of an opening statement at a 
trial. He has come to the floor even 
today to question, challenge, diminish, 
even ridicule the entire impeachment 
proceeding. To me, that steps over a 
line—a line where we were sworn to 
show impartial justice in this pro-
ceeding. When the Senator from Ken-
tucky comes to the floor and says, for 
example, that this is a hurried process, 
he raises the question as to whether 
the impeachment proceedings in the 
House were appropriate. He is correct 
when he says that the previous im-
peachments have had lengthy inves-
tigations leading up to them. In fact, 
one I recall before I was elected to Con-
gress involving President Nixon went 
on for months on questions of the Wa-
tergate scandal, which was at the heart 
of the proposed Nixon impeachment. 
There were special prosecutors and in-
vestigators and people who worked

constantly for month after month after 
month before the Articles of Impeach-
ment were being prepared. You may re-
call that President Nixon resigned be-
fore 
the 
actual 
impeachment 
pro-
ceeding. 
But, then again, there was the Ken 
Starr investigation under President 
Clinton. It, too, went on for months 
with sworn testimony and depositions 
and videotaped proceedings of wit-
nesses that led up to the impeachment. 
This is different. The case is being 
brought to us by the House of Rep-
resentatives for the impeachment of 
President Trump. It is true that in 
comparison it had a shorter investiga-
tive process, shorter than the two I 
just referenced. But it is also true that 
the second count of the Articles of Im-
peachment raises the question as to 
whether the President cooperated in 
providing witnesses and evidence that 
led to the Articles of Impeachment in 
the House, and that is one of the 
counts of impeachment against him— 
that he didn’t participate and cooper-
ate. 
For the Senator from Kentucky to 
stand here and say that it should have 
been a lengthier proceeding in the 
House—there should have been more 
witnesses; there should have been more 
evidence—is to ignore the obvious. One 
of the counts of impeachment raises 
the question as to whether the Presi-
dent appropriately denied any coopera-
tion with the House impeachment pro-
ceeding. 
Secondly, the Senator from Ken-
tucky comes to the floor and consist-
ently says that the suggestion that we 
should allow witnesses and evidence to 
be considered is evidence of the weak-
ness of the case coming out of the 
House of Representatives. Well, there 
aren’t an exact number of parallels be-
tween ordinary civil and criminal liti-
gation and impeachment proceedings, 
but in the world of law and trials, there 
is usually an opening pleading or pro-
ceeding through a grand jury that 
leads to charges against an individual. 
I have been through that many times 
on the civil side—rarely, but once in a 
while, on the criminal side. The trial 
itself takes that initial pleading, that 
initial statement of a case, and elabo-
rates on it, opens up, brings in evidence 
and witnesses on both sides. 
When we talk about witnesses and 
evidence coming before the Senate on 
any 
impeachment 
proceeding 
with 
President Trump, it isn’t just on one 
side of the case. What we are sug-
gesting is there should be witnesses 
from both sides. Let the President 
bring those who he believes can speak 
most convincingly to his innocence. 
Let the House managers supporting im-
peachment take the opposite position 
and find those witnesses who they 
think tell the story from their side of 
the case. That is the nature of a trial. 
The American people have seen it over 
and over again in their personal lives 
and in what they have witnessed on 
television and other places. Both sides 
put on their best evidence, and, ulti-
mately, the jury decides the truth of 
the matter. That is all the Democrats 
are asking for here. 
We are asking that the impeachment 
proceeding witnesses be allowed on 
both sides, evidence be allowed on both 
sides, and, ultimately, as Senator 
SCHUMER said earlier, we get to the 
truth of the matter; we make our deci-
sion in the Senate; and the American 
people get to witness this democratic 
process. 
Senator MCCONNELL has said in many 
different places that he resists this 
idea of witnesses and evidence, but I 
hope he will reconsider. I hope at least 
four Republican Senators will recon-
sider—if they are in Senator MCCON-
NELL’s position—and opt, instead, for 
the historic precedent of witnesses and 
evidence at a trial. 
The Senate will change this week. If 
you are witnessing it through C–SPAN 
or in the audience in the Galleries, you 
will notice it. First, the Senators will 
be on the floor of the Senate, which is 
rare, and second, with the Chief Justice 
presiding, there is a much different air 
in the proceedings and business of the 
Senate. 
The final point I want to make is 
that I am troubled by the continued 
suggestion that the prospect of an im-
peachment trial is holding the Senate 
hostage, that we cannot consider seri-
ous legislation because of the possi-
bility of an impeachment trial. It is 
true that once the trial starts, we de-
vote ourselves to it. But that hasn’t 
happened. 
So how do the leaders of the Senate 
on the Republican side explain the year 
2019? It was a unique year in the his-
tory of the Senate. It was unique for 
what we failed to do. During the course 
of the entire year, the Senate consid-
ered 22 amendments total. There were 
22 amendments on the floor of the Sen-
ate. Six were offered by the junior Sen-
ator from Kentucky, all of which, I be-
lieve, failed. But there were 22 amend-
ments in a year. I can tell you that it 
is not unusual if you look at the his-
tory of the Senate for us to consider 22 
amendments in the course of a week, 
sometimes in the course of a day. But 
in the entire year, there were only 22 
amendments. Why? Because Senator 
MCCONNELL, who has the power under 
the Senate rules, decided there would 
be no business before the Senate but 
for the filling of judicial vacancies and 
other Executive appointments. That 
was it. A handful of other pieces of leg-
islation were considered—the Defense 
authorization bill and, finally, a mas-
sive spending bill—but never with 
amendments. So to suggest that the 
impeachment trial has something to do 
with the inactivity in the Senate is to 
ignore the obvious. 
Last year, before there were any Ar-
ticles of Impeachment, Senator MCCON-
NELL, under his leadership, called for 
virtually nothing to be debated and 
considered on the floor of the Senate. I 
have said this before, and I stand by it. 
This is a Senate Chamber, but too 
many days, in too many respects, it is 
a storage facility. We are storing the 
desks of the Senate, once occupied by 
Senators who came here to work. They 
offered bills, offered amendments, had 
real debates and votes. We look at 
these desks and say: Boy, it must have 
been a great day in the Senate when 
you actually did that. 
For the Republicans to blame the im-
peachment process for the inactivity of 
last year defies common sense. For 
that reason, I hope that when the im-
peachment trial ends, Senator MCCON-
NELL of Kentucky, the Republican ma-
jority leader, will consider at least 1 of 
the more than 200 bills that the Demo-
cratic House of Representatives has 
sent us to consider—bills relating to 
healthcare, bills relating to the price 
of prescription drugs, bills relating to 
student loans, bills relating to immi-
gration. They are all sitting some-
where in a file cabinet and a computer 
somewhere in Senator MCCONNELL’s of-
fice. Maybe we can be the Senate after 
the impeachment trial. It is in the 
hands of Senator MCCONNELL to make 
that decision. 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Madam President, let me speak to an 
issue that has been raised this morn-
ing, which is timely and critically im-
portant. The President tweeted last 
week to the country: ‘‘All is well.’’ As 
we were teetering on the verge of war 
with Iran, he tweeted: ‘‘All is well.’’ 
But now details have come to light, 
and it is clear that all is not well. U.S. 
servicemembers of Ain Al-Asad Air 
Base in Iraq faced a sustained hour and 
a half of Iranian retaliatory attacks 
last week—a barrage described by one 
of the most senior commanders on the 
base as ‘‘designed and organized to in-
flict as many casualties as possible.’’ 
Contrary to the tweet by our President 
that all is well, reports from witnesses 
suggest that despite heroic planning, 
we were, in fact, very fortunate—if not 
lucky—that none of our U.S. personnel 
were killed. 
This gets me to the issue that needs 
to be brought before the Senate, one 
that goes to the heart of this Senate’s 
critical, often neglected, constitutional 
responsibility. It is not whether Ira-
nian General Soleimani was an enemy 
with American blood on his hands— 
that is a fact—but it is too simplistic 
to stop there. We have known that fact 
for a long time. Previous Presidents of 
both political parties have known Gen-
eral Soleimani’s background—it is not 
in dispute—but it is a distraction to 
stop with that conversation. 
The real question is whether Presi-
dent Trump, when he made the deci-
sion to target General Soleimani, con-
sidered the possibility that it would 
quickly escalate into a much larger 
confrontation with Iran, which is the 
possibility of a war—a distinct possi-
bility and one never authorized by Con-
gress. 
Based on the administration’s brief-
ing last week, which I sat through, I

doubt if even they think they need con-
gressional authorization to ask our 
sons and daughters, grandsons and 
granddaughters to participate in an-
other war in the Middle East. The first 
question asked by Senator MCCONNELL 
at the briefing, which was attended by 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary 
of Defense, and the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, was whether 
there was a need for authorization 
under the War Powers Act before the 
United States continued to have its 
conflict with Iran. The answer that 
came from the Secretary of Defense 
was that there was no authorization 
necessary. He went on to say that he 
thought even the debate over author-
ization could be unsettling and trouble-
some for our troops if it appeared that 
we were uncertain as to whether we 
were ready to go to war. 
Based on that briefing, I doubt this 
administration believes any congres-
sional authorization is needed for the 
military action that has been taken or 
that might even be contemplated. 
Quite simply, the fact that the Senate 
has not exercised its constitutional 
right, authority, and responsibility to 
determine whether we should go to war 
with Iran troubles me. I am deeply con-
cerned that if Iran retaliates further or 
if the President decides to escalate the 
confrontation, this Chamber will not 
even recognize—let alone act on—its 
constitutional responsibility under Ar-
ticle I, Section 8. 
That is why I have joined my col-
league and friend Senator TIM KAINE, 
of Virginia, in invoking the War Pow-
ers Act—a law passed over President 
Nixon’s veto after Presidents of both 
parties deliberately misled the Amer-
ican people on the Vietnam war. It is 
hard for those who did not live during 
that era to appreciate what that war 
did to this Nation. First and foremost, 
it cost us almost 50,000 American lives, 
and hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans were injured—men and women in 
uniform who bravely served our coun-
try. They gave their lives and came 
home with the scars they carried for 
their lifetimes. The billions of dollars 
that were spent and our involvement in 
that war, which divided this country at 
its core, are hard to put into words in 
just a few moments. 
At the end of it, though, Congress re-
alized that it had failed in its own re-
sponsibility to even declare a war 
against Vietnam. So we passed the War 
Powers Act and set up a process that 
said we are not going to let that hap-
pen again, that the American people 
will participate in any future decisions 
about whether we go to war, and that 
they will do it through their elected 
Congressmen and elected Senators. 
The War Powers Act passed the Con-
gress, and it was sent to President 
Nixon. He vetoed it and said we didn’t 
want to give that additional authority 
to Congress. Then, in a rare, rare mo-
ment, Congress overrode President Nix-
on’s veto, and the War Powers Act be-
came the law of the land. That War 
Powers Act, I believe, applies to the 
current situation that is escalating 
with Iran. That is why I have joined 
with Senator KAINE in his invoking the 
War Powers Resolution. 
What I find particularly troubling 
about the administration’s march to 
war in Iran is that the administration’s 
own actions have contributed to the 
current tensions and problems we have 
with Iran. Before taking office, Iran’s 
nuclear weapons program was halted 
because of an historic agreement Presi-
dent Obama negotiated. In cooperation 
with our allies in Europe, as well as 
with 
China 
and 
Russia, 
President 
Obama negotiated a treaty that re-
quired international inspectors to be 
on the ground in Iran to make certain 
that Iran lived up to its terms. Of 
course, Iran was not happy about these 
inspectors, but it accepted them. On 
several different occasions, we had rep-
resentatives of those inspectors come 
and say, yes, that they had had vir-
tually unlimited access to Iran in order 
to make certain Iran didn’t violate the 
nuclear agreement. Iran continued in 
its malign behaviors in the region, but 
containment was easier without the 
threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb. 
During 
the 
campaign, 
President 
Trump said the first thing he would do 
would be to eliminate that inter-
national 
agreement 
that 
required 
international inspectors, which is what 
stopped Iran from developing a nuclear 
weapon. It made no sense for the Presi-
dent to take the position that he did, 
but that is the position that he an-
nounced during the campaign, and that 
is exactly what he did after he was 
elected President. He withdrew the 
United States from this agreement 
that stopped Iran from developing a 
nuclear weapon. Then he increased 
sanctions on Iran, and the tensions be-
tween our countries grew. 
The President pursued a policy of re-
gime change that is very difficult to 
explain, if not to justify—trying to 
flatter on one day and to confront on 
the next day. He proposed to meet with 
President Rouhani, of Iran, to nego-
tiate a supposedly bigger deal, a better 
deal. Then he threatened Iran mili-
tarily and tightened sanctions soon 
after. These efforts went nowhere ex-
cept to increase tensions between the 
United States and Iran. Iran lashed out 
on American interests. We were alien-
ated from many of our allies, particu-
larly those who were party to the nu-
clear agreement, and Iran inched closer 
to restarting its nuclear program. 
In recent weeks alone, President 
Trump has managed to reverse the re-
cent Iraqi protest settlement that 
warned Iran to stop meddling in its 
particular politics, which has led to the 
real possibility that American troops 
in Iraq that are critical to countering 
ISIS will be expelled. 
Similarly, after months of anti-gov-
ernment protests in Iran, President 
Trump 
has 
almost 
instantaneously 
united 
the 
Iranian 
public 
opinion 
against us with the targeting of Gen-
eral Soleimani. Iran has now an-
nounced it will exceed the limits of the 
nuclear program that were imposed by 
the nuclear agreement, from which 
President Trump walked away, and our 
interests around the region are on high 
alert for fear of a retaliatory attack by 
the Iranians. 
So there are real questions as to how 
President Trump’s Iran policy serves 
long-term American security interests 
and as to whether this body is ready to 
at least debate the possibility of an-
other war with Iran. 
Before President Trump plunges us 
into another reckless Middle East war, 
shouldn’t we first remember how we 
were fooled into invading Iraq in the 
first place? I remember full well. 
I was a Member of the Senate when 
we were given the proposal of taking 
military action against Iraq because of 
its purported possession of these mili-
tary devices that were threatening to 
the United States and to the region. 
Many of us were skeptical. The weap-
ons of mass destruction charge didn’t 
have the evidence that we thought was 
convincing. In the end, 23 Senators—22 
Democrats and 1 Republican—joined in 
voting against the invasion of Iraq. I 
was one of those Senators. I was not 
convinced there were weapons of mass 
destruction. After the invasion and 
after careful inspection, it turned out 
that there were no weapons of mass de-
struction—the single event that really 
brought us into the conflict. 
Then, as now, we were led to believe 
there was an urgent spiraling of events 
that required U.S. military interven-
tion. Mark me down as skeptical— 
skeptical as to whether another inva-
sion by the United States of a Muslim 
nation in the Middle East is in the best 
interest of national security. 
Many around President Trump, par-
ticularly Secretary of State Pompeo, 
have been speaking of this conflict 
with Iraq for a long period of time. 
Some of them are the same people who 
endorsed the invasion of Iraq almost 20 
years ago. We are still in Iraq. We have 
given up more than 5,000 American 
lives, with many having been injured 
and with $1 trillion or more having 
been spent. 
It is possible the Iraqis will just ask 
us to leave. Think of that. After all 
that we have put into their country, 
their legislature—their Parliament— 
voted several weeks ago to tell us to 
leave. In fact, one of the great trage-
dies of the Iraq war and one that few of 
its architects ever owned up to was 
that the Iraq war was actually empow-
ering Iran in the region. Iran became a 
potent force because, in many respects, 
in its efforts in the Middle East, the 
United States created that oppor-
tunity. 
These same unrepentant voices are 
again beating the drums for regime 
change in Iran and another war in the 
Middle East. They do so with a Presi-
dent who has made more than 15,000 
false or misleading statements while 
he has been in office—15,000—with his

even going so far as to trust Vladimir 
Putin, the leader of Russia, over our 
own intelligence sources, making it 
impossible to trust anything he says 
when it comes to matters as grave as 
war. 
Some have even had the audacity to 
argue that the 2001 authorization for 
use of military force in Iraq is some-
how a permission slip for the invasion 
of Iran. That is preposterous. I cannot 
imagine anyone here who took that 
vote 18 years ago thought that he was 
authorizing for future Presidents 18 
years later to invade another country 
in the Middle East. I certainly didn’t. 
The Constitution is clear. Article I, 
section 8 says the power to declare war 
is an explicit power of Congress, as it 
should be. One should never send our 
sons and daughters into war without 
having the knowledge and consent of 
the American people. Our Founding Fa-
thers were wise in making sure this 
awesome power did not rest with a 
King or a Queen or anyone pretending 
to be but with the people of the United 
States and their elected Representa-
tives. 
I have made this same argument and 
much of the same speech in the past re-
gardless of whether the occupant of the 
White House was a Democrat or a Re-
publican. This Congress, already afraid 
to stand up to many of President 
Trump’s worst instincts, must not do 
so in a march to another war in the 
Middle East. As such, I urge my col-
leagues here to do our job and reaffirm 
the Senate’s constitutional role in 
matters of war. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Texas. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on Jan-
uary 20, 2017, at 12:19 p.m., the Wash-
ington Post ran a story with this head-
line: ‘‘The campaign to impeach Presi-
dent Trump has begun.’’ Donald Trump 
had been President for only 19 minutes 
when that headline ran. 
As we have since learned, it has been 
made abundantly clear that many of 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
simply 
don’t recognize the President as having 
been legitimately elected, and they 
have been doing everything they can to 
remove him from office since he was 
first elected in 2016. 
This has now taken a new form, that 
of impeachment—an impeachment that 
occurred 27 days ago when the House 
voted for two Articles of Impeachment. 
Their impeachment inquiry lasted 12 
weeks, but it became clear that Speak-
er PELOSI and Chairman SCHIFF and 
Chairman NADLER were in a big hurry 
to get those Articles of Impeachment 
voted out of the House before the holi-
days. In the end, only the Democrats 
voted for these partisan Articles of Im-
peachment. Then the Speaker and the 
Democrats in the House declared vic-
tory. 
That is when the breakneck pace of 
the impeachment process came to a 
screeching halt. It appears Speaker 
PELOSI got cold feet when she realized 
the President would be afforded a fair 
trial in the Senate. That was not good 
enough for her. When we offered Presi-
dent Trump the same terms that Presi-
dent Clinton received during his trial, 
that wasn’t good enough for Speaker 
PELOSI, for she wanted guarantees from 
the Senate. The Speaker of the House 
flatly refused to send the Articles of 
Impeachment to the Senate in order 
for her to somehow gain leverage over 
Senate trial procedures—a responsi-
bility that falls far outside her job de-
scription. She was seeking assurances 
from the majority leader that he would 
redo the House’s shoddy investigative 
work—something that is not part of 
our job description under the Constitu-
tion. 
After weeks of holding the articles 
hostage with nothing to show for it, 
the Speaker has, apparently, finally 
caved. In holding the articles, she man-
aged to accomplish something all too 
uncommon these days: she brought to-
gether 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
from both Chambers. Unfortunately, 
for the Speaker, this bipartisan, bi-
cameral chorus of voices stood in firm 
opposition to her decision to withhold 
the articles. 
Last week, she finally announced 
that she would be sending over the ar-
ticles this week, and it now looks like 
a vote is scheduled for Wednesday, to-
morrow, where impeachment managers 
will be identified, and the process of 
sending it to the Senate will begin in 
earnest. In a letter to her House col-
leagues on Friday, Speaker PELOSI in-
dicated she would be sending the arti-
cles this week, and it looks like we are 
rapidly closing on the start of that 
trial. 
As the majority leader has made 
clear from the beginning, this should 
be a far cry from the partisan impeach-
ment process we saw in the House. We 
simply 
don’t 
want 
to 
repeat 
the 
circuslike, partisan rush to impeach-
ment that we saw in the House. Our re-
sponsibilities as Senators is to sit as a 
court—literally, as a jury—to consider 
the case that is being presented by the 
impeachment managers in the House as 
well as the President’s lawyers. 
Despite the Speaker’s insistence, we, 
the Senate—the jury—are not going to 
be handpicking the witnesses before 
the trial begins. In no courtroom in 
America does the jury decide how the 
case before them will be tried. That is 
decided by the parties to the lawsuit, 
whether it is the prosecution in the 
case of a criminal case and the defense 
lawyer or the plaintiff and defense 
counsel in a civil case. The jury’s job is 
to sit and listen and to weigh the evi-
dence and to reach a verdict. 
The Senate will—instead of the proc-
ess Speaker PELOSI is advocating for— 
follow the only modern precedent we 
have, and that is the Clinton impeach-
ment trial. If it was good enough for 
President Clinton, it is good enough for 
President Trump. We are going to fol-
low that precedent and provide for 
some order and fairness in the process 
and, again, not repeat the circus we 
saw in the House. 
Just as we did in 1999, in the Clinton 
impeachment, we will begin with open-
ing arguments. The impeachment man-
agers, Speaker PELOSI’s lawyers, will 
come over and present their case and 
argue their case. Then we will turn to 
the President’s lawyers who will have a 
chance to respond. They can refer to 
some of the testimony of the 17 wit-
nesses who testified during the House 
impeachment inquiry. They could offer 
additional evidence for the Senate to 
consider. 
This is not a question of witnesses or 
no witnesses. That is a blatant mis-
representation by those who are trying 
to somehow work the public’s under-
standing of exactly how this will pro-
ceed. As in the Clinton impeachment 
trial, all 100 Senators will have an op-
portunity to hear the case from both 
sides before making a decision whether 
we, the jury, want to have additional 
witnesses presented. That is what hap-
pened in the Clinton case, and that is 
what should happen with President 
Trump. 
We will have an opportunity to ask 
written questions, which will be trans-
mitted to the Chief Justice, who will 
then put those questions to the lawyers 
representing the impeachment man-
agers and the President. Then we will 
be able to get information from them 
based on those questions. 
The more I thought about it—ordi-
narily, in a trial you would have dis-
puted facts, and then you would have 
the law applied to the facts as found by 
the jury, but the more and more I have 
heard about this impeachment inquiry, 
the more and more I am inclined to be-
lieve that the facts are not disputed. If 
the facts are not really disputed, why 
would you need additional witnesses? 
There are people with opinions, there 
are people who draw inferences, and 
there are people who draw their own 
conclusions, but in the end, that is our 
job, not the witnesses’ job. The wit-
nesses’ job is to provide the facts, 
should they be disputed, and it is our 
job then to decide whether this meets 
the constitutional standard of treason, 
bribery, or high crimes and mis-
demeanors. 
What I find so amazing about these 
impeachment articles is neither one of 
them claim that President Trump com-
mitted a crime. Unlike the Clinton im-
peachment, where he was charged with 
perjury—with lying under oath—Presi-
dent Trump is not charged with any 
crime. 
In the first Article of Impeachment, 
basically, what we have is a disagree-
ment in the way in which the President 
handled aid voted by Congress that 
would then be given to the Government 
of the Ukraine. That is what this im-
peachment is about. This is not about 
high crimes and misdemeanors. 
This is about political differences. 
This is about stylistic differences. This

is where diplomats and others disagree 
with the way the President handled 
himself. Well, fair enough, you are en-
titled to your opinion, but that doesn’t 
make impeachment the appropriate 
remedy. 
Here we are 11 months more or less 
until the next general election. I, for 
one, think it is dangerous to have 535 
Members of Congress essentially be 
asked to convict and remove a Presi-
dent 11 months before the next general 
election; in other words, to substitute 
our views with those of the voters, the 
American people. I think that is very 
dangerous. If it succeeds here, I guar-
antee this will not be the last time. 
Unfortunately, the House has nor-
malized this concept of impeachment 
essentially for political differences. 
That is a dangerous concept, and it 
would be a dangerous precedent if we 
were to accept it. 
This is the third time in American 
history—the history of our entire coun-
try—where this process will go forward 
in the Senate. We need to be very care-
ful, very sober, very serious, and very 
deliberate in how we conduct ourselves 
and how we conduct this trial. 
Unfortunately, Speaker PELOSI has 
violated her own admonition when, in 
March of 2019, she said that impeach-
ment is too divisive, and it is just not 
worth it unless it is bipartisan, unless 
it is compelling. Well, this impeach-
ment is neither bipartisan nor compel-
ling. Speaker PELOSI
apparently got 
stampeded by the more radical mem-
bers of her caucus into this position, 
which now she is trying to find some 
face-saving way out. That is what this 
is about. 
In the end, we know the politics, un-
fortunately, will continue in the Sen-
ate. We know that under the present 
circumstances, it is highly unlikely 
that 67 Senators, based on the record 
we know now, would vote to convict 
and remove the President. So what is 
all this posturing and grandstanding 
about with regard to witnesses or no 
witnesses—which I said earlier is a 
false choice. There will be witnesses, 
and there will be evidence. We are 
going to let the parties present it, and 
we are going to listen and make a deci-
sion. 
This is about the Democratic leader 
trying to put incumbent Senators who 
are on the ballot in 2020 in a tough po-
sition. That is what this is all about. 
In the end, this is not about Presi-
dent Trump. This is about who is going 
to maintain the majority in the Sen-
ate—whether 
Republicans 
will 
or 
whether the Democratic leader will ac-
complish his life’s dream and become 
the next majority leader. That is what 
this is about. 
Well, unfortunately, the Speaker’s 
senseless delay tactics have robbed us 
all of the valuable time that we could 
have spent conducting this trial and 
moving on to more constructive busi-
ness. We are waiting for the Speaker to 
deliver the articles, but in the mean-
time 
we 
are 
not 
sitting 
around 
twiddling our thumbs. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. President, last week, the Senate 
Finance 
Committee 
overwhelmingly 
passed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade 
agreement, which will replace NAFTA 
and guide our trade with Mexico and 
Canada into the future. This is a big 
deal for Texas and a big deal for the 
country. About 13 million jobs depend 
on trade between Mexico, Canada, and 
the United States. 
We waited a long time for the oppor-
tunity to take up the USMCA. The 
heads of all three countries initially 
signed the deal back in November of 
2019, and for over a year this is another 
example of the House foot-dragging. 
At several points, we were left won-
dering whether the Speaker would in-
tentionally blow up the trade deal over 
their own political motivations, but 
fortunately that didn’t happen. We had 
a long delay, but we are finally to the 
point where the Senate can take up 
and pass the USMCA now that the 
House acted just before Christmas. 
This week, several Senate committees 
will review various portions of the 
agreement, and I hope we can actually 
get this trade agreement approved be-
fore we go to the impeachment trial. 
We will have the War Powers Resolu-
tion, which is privileged, and so that 
will come first, but hopefully there will 
be an opportunity to pass the USMCA 
before we go to this impeachment trial. 
I have heard from countless of my 
constituents whose livelihoods depend 
on strong international trade, particu-
larly with our southern neighbor, and 
they are eager to see this USMCA put 
to bed. It is frustrating that this proc-
ess has already been prolonged and un-
certainty has prevailed and kept farm-
ers, ranchers, and manufacturers wait-
ing for months on end, not knowing 
what ultimately would happen with the 
USMCA. 
So I am ready for the Speaker to de-
liver her promise and finally transmit 
the Articles of Impeachment to the 
Senate so we can conduct that sober, 
deliberate trial according to the Con-
stitution and then move on from these 
partisan games and get back to the 
work we were sent here to do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-

NOMINATION OF PETER GAYNOR 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to

I have known and worked with Pete 
Gaynor for over a decade. Before tak-
ing over as FEMA Deputy Adminis-
trator in 2018 and becoming the Acting 
Administrator in 2019, Pete was the 
emergency management director for 
the city of Providence and then the 
State of Rhode Island. 
As a U.S. marine, he was on duty 
near the Pentagon on September 11, 
2001, and helped direct important as-
pects of the response and recovery ef-
forts in the days and weeks that fol-
lowed. Later, he went on to serve in 
U.S. operations in Iraq before return-
ing home to Rhode Island. 
As EMA, emergency management 
agency director in Rhode Island, Pete 
led the response to federally declared 
disasters in our State and worked to 
successfully earn national emergency 
management accreditation for both the 
Providence and Rhode Island emer-
gency management agencies. I know he 
will tap this full experience to serve 
the American people as FEMA Admin-
istrator, and FEMA needs solid leader-
ship. 
Indeed, as the flagship Federal Agen-
cy for disaster preparedness and re-
sponse, 
FEMA 
faces 
extraordinary 
challenges, confronting the very real 
effects of climate-related disasters, re-
forming the National Flood Insurance 
Program, administering critical grant 
programs, and helping ready the Na-
tion for possible chemical, biological, 
and radiological attacks. 
Make no mistake, I have deep con-
cerns about many aspects of the ad-
ministration’s approach to disaster re-
covery. Puerto Rico is a case in point. 
Now it is facing new challenges. As 
ranking member of the Transportation- 
HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I 
have been dismayed by the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development’s 
slow-walking of billions of dollars of 
disaster recovery assistance for Puerto 
Rico. 
As the lead Agency for disaster re-
sponse and recovery, FEMA must set 
the standard for professionalism and 
compassion for people and commu-
nities going through the worst experi-
ence of their lives. It is my expectation 
and my confidence that Peter Gaynor 
will work to make sure it happens. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting to confirm him. 
With that, I yield the floor.

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, in 
the next few days, Senate Democrats 
will move to discharge a War Powers 
Resolution to tie the President’s hands 
in defending this Nation against Iran 
and terrorist masterminds like Qasem 
Soleimani. Let’s think about how we 
got here and the implications of this 
reckless action. 
Qasem Soleimani has the blood of 
thousands of Americans on his hands 
and hundreds of thousands of innocent 
souls across the Middle East. For more 
than 20 years, he was the Supreme 
Leader’s 
most 
trusted 
lieutenant, 
Iran’s terror mastermind, and the man 
responsible for the deaths of hundreds 
of American soldiers in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan by supplying the most dead-
ly kinds of roadside bombs soldiers 
ever faced. He and his proxies and Ira-
nian leaders like him are responsible 
for bombings of our Embassies in 
places like Lebanon and Kuwait. They 
are, in no small part, responsible for 
the ongoing horror of the Syrian civil 
war, for the civil war in Yemen. There 
is no doubt, based on the intelligence 
we have and this bloodthirsty past, 
that Qasem Soleimani was in Baghdad 
on January 2 to plot something very 
dangerous and very big that was going 
to target Americans once again. 
We should all be thankful that Qasem 
Soleimani no longer walks the Earth, 
and we should be proud of the troops 
who executed that mission. The world 
is a safer place and America is a safer 
nation because of it. The people of Iran 
have been given a voice against the 
man who was responsible for mowing 
them down in protests over the years 
and whose death they have been out on 
the streets celebrating even though 
they risk being mowed down by their 
own security forces once again. 
Yet, over the last 2 weeks, the Demo-
crats have been able to do nothing but 
express their regret for the President’s 
decision 
to 
eliminate 
Qasem 
Soleimani. And make no mistake—this 
War Powers Resolution is not about 
the future; it is about delivering an im-
plicit or, if you listen to their words 
and don’t just read the resolution, an 
explicit rebuke to the President for or-
dering the killing of Qasem Soleimani. 
They certainly want to prevent the 
President from doing anything like 
that in the future. That is why they 
have introduced this War Powers Reso-
lution. 
We should always remind ourselves 
when we are having a war powers de-
bate, as we do from time to time, the 
War Powers Resolution is unconstitu-
tional. It was passed by a liberal Con-
gress in 1973 at the height of Water-
gate, and not a single President since 
then has acknowledged its constitu-
tionality—not a single one, to include 
all the Democrats. 
I hear a lot about the Constitution 
these days and reclaiming our author-
ity to declare war and to constrain the 
Executive. I guess all those constitu-
tional experts missed the Federalist 
Papers and their authoritative expla-
nation of the Constitution and why we 
have the government we do. We have a 
House of Representatives with 435 peo-
ple to be the institution that is most 
closely tied to popular opinion. We 
have a Senate to act as the cool and de-
liberate sense of community. And we 
have a single President—a single Presi-
dent—to act on behalf of the entire Na-
tion in moments of peril. 
Federalist 70, if they would just open 
up that authoritative explanation of 
the Constitution, says why there is one 
President, not a council of two or three 
or four, as some of the States had at 
the time of the founding. Because of 
the division of opinion and perspective 
and temperament that an executive 
council would have, there is one Presi-
dent—one President—who can act, as 
Federalist 70 said, with energy and dis-
patch and, yes, in some occasions, with 
secrecy. So if the Founders didn’t 
think we should have an executive 
council of 3 or 4 or 5 people, imagine 
what they would have thought about 
535 commanders in chief making oper-
ational decisions about when to take 
action on the battlefield. 
These debates about War Powers Res-
olutions are really about how many 
lawyers and armchair rangers can 
dance on the head of a pin. Do you 
think wars and battles are won with 
paper resolutions? Those wars and bat-
tles are won with iron resolution. Do 
you think the ayatollahs are intimi-
dated by ‘‘whereas’’ clauses and joint 
resolutions? The ayatollahs are intimi-
dated, deterred, and scared when we in-
cinerate their terror mastermind and 
we tell them that we will do it again if 
they harm another American. 
Even if you grant the War Powers 
Resolution constitutional, look at the 
actual text of this resolution. It makes 
no exception for Iran developing a nu-
clear weapon. The ayatollahs could 
hold a press conference tomorrow or 
the Supreme Leader could tweet that 
they are going to rush to a nuclear 
breakout. The President would have to 
come to Congress if he would want to 
take any kind of action to deter it. It 
makes no exception for designated ter-
rorist organizations and individuals, 
like the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
Corps and its Quds Force, who have 
killed so many Americans and continue 
to target them today. It makes no ex-
ception for attacks on our allies in the 
Middle East, nations like Israel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S177 
January 14, 2020 
The sponsor of this resolution will 
say: Oh, it makes an exception for im-
minent attacks. 
We have seen what that gets us over 
the last couple of weeks—again, law-
yers and armchair rangers arguing 
about the meaning of ‘‘imminence.’’ 
Well, I have to say that whether an at-
tack is imminent looks pretty different 
if you are a soldier on patrol in Iraq 
than if you are a comfortable Senator 
sitting behind secure walls and armed 
guards. 
None of this means Congress has no 
role in matters of life and death on the 
battlefield. It is very far from it, in 
fact, and I will take a back seat to no 
one in asserting that constitutional au-
thority. I would remind my colleagues 
that when we had an opportunity to in-
sist that Barack Obama’s nuclear deal 
with Iran be submitted to this Cham-
ber as a treaty, there was one Senator 
who voted to insist on that—only one. 
This guy. Ninety-eight other Senators 
were perfectly willing to create some 
made-up, 
phony-baloney 
procedure 
that allowed Barack Obama to submit 
a nuclear arms agreement with a sworn 
and mortal enemy that chants ‘‘Death 
to America’’ and put it into effect with 
a large majority opposed to him, as op-
posed to the two-thirds majority that 
our Constitution requires for treaties. 
We do have a tremendous degree of 
constitutional authority in the Con-
gress. We regulate interstate com-
merce, which means sanctions. We con-
firm Ambassadors. We confirm the 
President’s Cabinet. We declare war, 
which we have done only a few times in 
our past despite hundreds of instances 
of introducing troops. But most impor-
tantly, and the way to constrain the 
Executive if this Congress thinks he 
should be constrained in a particular 
case, we have the spending power—in 
particular, the spending power for our 
Armed Forces. That is the way the 
Congress—any 
Congress 
with 
any 
President—can control the use of the 
Armed Forces by the President. It is 
something this Congress has done a lot 
in the past. We did it in Vietnam, did 
it in Nicaragua, and did it in Somalia. 
There were plenty of times where the 
President has acted in some ways in a 
much more aggressive and far-reaching 
fashion than President Trump did just 
a couple weeks ago—the first Taiwan 
Strait crisis, Granada in 1983, Libya in 
1986, and Iran in 1988. I would even say 
Libya again in 2011, although most of 
my Democratic colleagues like to send 
that down the memory hole since it 
was a Democratic President. 
So I would simply say that if you dis-
agree with the President’s decision to 
kill the world’s most sadistic, blood-
thirsty, terrorist mastermind and you 
want to stop him from doing so again, 
file your bill to prohibit the use of any 
taxpayer funds for such operations. It 
is very simple. It is one page. I will 
help you write it, if you need help—one 
page: No funds will be used to support 
operations 
by 
the 
Armed 
Forces 
against the Government of Iran or any 
of its officials. Do it. Have the courage 
of your convictions. 
Why are we not seeing that bill? Be-
cause it failed just last year. All of 
these same politicians offered language 
on our annual Defense bill to try to 
prohibit the use of any funds in oper-
ations like we just saw, and it failed. 
We passed a defense bill, as we always 
do, by overwhelming majorities, which 
means they don’t have the votes be-
cause they know their position is not 
popular with the American people. Not 
surprisingly, 
the 
American 
people 
don’t want their elected leaders to act 
as lawyers for the ayatollahs. 
So if you are not going to act in what 
is our true constitutional power, spare 
us the unconstitutional and dangerous 
War Powers Resolutions and simply let 
the people who are serious about our 
national security—from troops on up 
to the top—do what is necessary to 
keep this country safe. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

f 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to mark an-
other major milestone for the land-
mark 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada 
Trade 
Agreement. 
This 
morning, 
Madam 
President, with you in the committee 
in voting, the Environment and Public 
Works 
Committee 
overwhelmingly 
passed the USMCA. With the approval 
of our committee, the USMCA is now 
one step closer to final passage in the 
Senate. 
We all know that it isn’t perfect, but, 
still, it is an important deal that bene-
fits all Americans. Passing this deal 
provides much needed certainty for 
America’s manufacturers. Our ranchers 
and our farmers—certainly, in Wyo-
ming but across the breadbasket of the 
country 
and 
the 
Rocky 
Mountain 
West—are counting on it as well. 
Americans have waited patiently now 
for over a year. Speaker PELOSI was the 
roadblock and held this hostage for an 
extended period of time. She finally al-
lowed the House to vote on it. Now the 
Senate is working to move this critical 
piece of legislation forward and to the 
President. 
Passing USMCA will start the next 
chapter in the American economic suc-
cess story. The deal is going to in-
crease our gross domestic product by 
$70 billion. Above all, it is a win for 
American workers. It is going to create 
180,000 U.S. jobs, and you know that is 
just the start. Already, our strong, 
healthy, and growing economy has 
been setting records across the board. 
It is thanks to Republican pro-growth 
policies. That is what we look to and 
point to when we take a look at the 
record job growth we have had since 
President Trump has taken office. 
In just 3 years, we have created over 
7 million new jobs in America. The un-
employment rate is at a 50-year low. It 
is astonishing. Wage growth is the fast-
est it has been in a decade, especially 
benefiting lower income workers. Ev-
eryone is better off with this growing 
economy. There is still some untapped 
potential, and we need to unlock it 
now. 
My home State of Wyoming is poised 
to reap huge benefits not only from 
USMCA; our State has much to gain 
from new trade agreements with China 
and with Japan as well. The China 
trade agreement is scheduled to be 
signed tomorrow and Japan on January 
1. Together, these America-first trade 
deals mean expanded access to export 
markets. Wyoming farmers and ranch-
ers are very eager to seize these oppor-
tunities for future growth. 
I would just say, as I conclude, that 
here 
is 
the 
bottom 
line. 
Passing 
USMCA means more jobs, and it means 
economic growth. It means more cer-
tainty and more stability for our job 
creators. It means more opportunity 
and more prosperity for America’s 
working families. That is the real 
measure of this. It is time now for the 
Senate to pass the USMCA. 
I yield the floor.

f 
FREEDOM PROTESTS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, we are in the wake of another 
global event or happening, if you will. 
No matter what it is, we always have 
people who come in on the back side 
and, as I say, are a bunch of armchair 
quarterbacks 
and 
Monday 
morning 
quarterbacks, and they are trying to 
put their spin on what should have 
been done and what wasn’t done. I 
think that is probably a pretty good 
analogy when we think about the foot-
ball game that took place last night. 
What ought to be a serious discussion 
about national security or human 
rights inevitably devolves into a polit-
ical argument about who should be al-
lowed to score the most points off the 
blood and bravery of people who are 
fighting half a world away. Here is a 
suggestion for each of us: In times of 
conflict or unrest, instead of looking to 
the pundits and listening to a lot of 
pundits, why don’t we look to the peo-
ple themselves who are involved in 
these conflicts? 
After the U.S. strike that took out 
Qasem Soleimani, armchair quarter-
backs calling plays for the left picked 
up on what the propaganda arm of the 
Iranian regime was selling. Bear in 
mind, I just said the propaganda arm. 
After Tehran downed its own jet 
though, 
shouldn’t 
the 
conversation 
have pivoted to the outraged protests

not against Americans but against the 
Iranian Government? After all, those 
protests were fueled not by the act of 
one man but by months of domestic 
turmoil and decades of brutal repres-
sion by the Iranian regime against the 
people of Iran. Of course, it didn’t 
pivot. The false narrative of the mad 
American President prevailed, even as 
the people of Iran railed against the 
brutality of the ayatollahs and the in-
explicable recklessness of their own 
military. They were saying one thing, 
and the media said something else. 
In a stunning display of bravery, the 
people of Iran risked their lives—yes, 
they are risking their lives. In Novem-
ber, 304 got shot taking to the streets. 
The 
Revolutionary 
Guard 
brought 
about by Soleimani were shooting this 
week at people who were protesting 
and begging—begging for a little bit of 
freedom. It is amazing to me that it 
doesn’t get acknowledged. 
The 
decisive 
elimination 
of 
Soleimani exposed the regime’s ex-
treme 
vulnerability 
on 
the 
global 
stage, and I think the ayatollahs in 
Iran know this. This is why we saw 
them respond with threats against 
America at large. It is why they 
strong-armed the Iraqi Parliament into 
its foolish stand against American 
troops, why they arrested the United 
Kingdom’s Ambassador for attending a 
peace vigil, and why they violently re-
taliated against civilian speech. They 
know they are losing this argument. 
Tehran failed at silencing dissent. 
Their goal is to convince the rest of the 
world to ignore the protests of the Ira-
nian people. 
Authoritarianism is not bound to one 
particular region or ideology. As we 
saw last year, the repressive behavior 
of Communist China backfired on offi-
cials in Beijing. In their case, there 
wasn’t an airstrike or an incursion. 
There was just a simple but disastrous 
piece of legislation that would have 
jeopardized 
the 
already-strangled 
human rights of every citizen in Hong 
Kong—not just a few but everybody, 
blanket coverage. Don’t be caught 
speaking out against China and against 
Beijing. 
The fallout from that violation is 
now legendary. Millions took to the 
streets on behalf of democracy and self- 
determination and turned Beijing’s 
agenda on its head. Their protests cap-
tured the attention of the entire world 
and inspired others struggling to sur-
vive under Communist rule to speak 
up. 
This past Saturday, the people of 
Taiwan poured some additional salt on 
Beijing’s wounds by delivering a stun-
ning electoral rebuke against the Com-
munist Party. Taiwanese citizens cast 
a record number of ballots, pulling the 
pro-democracy ruling party out of a 2- 
year skid and validating President 
Tsai’s embrace of anti-Beijing pro-
testers in East Asia. Let me tell you, 
China knows exactly who is to blame 
for this, but in official statements they 
are writing off the results of the elec-
tion as a mere fluke, and they are 
blaming—get this—foreign interference 
for their humiliation. They couldn’t 
possibly be responsible for this. 
I have to tell you, the election may 
be over, but you can count on China to 
find other ways to coerce Taipei into 
submission. They will likely continue 
to pressure Taiwanese businessmen and 
workers living on the mainland to toe 
the party line and engage in more mili-
tary drills around Taiwan, with the 
goal of muscling away diplomatic sup-
port. It is all part of their playbook. 
Threats gilded in official policy are 
standard operating procedure for au-
thoritarian regimes, but overt crack-
downs on dissent still loom large over 
the heads of their people. Last Decem-
ber, China threatened to sanction the 
non-governmental organizations that 
backed pro-democracy legislation in 
Hong Kong. On Sunday, they suddenly 
refused entry to activists from Human 
Rights Watch without even pretending 
to provide a plausible explanation. 
Imagine that. They have moved so far 
in repression, they wouldn’t even let 
Human Rights Watch in the country to 
see what it is that they are doing to 
their people. 
Make no mistake, regimes like those 
in China or Iran are vicious and power-
ful, but right now, they are running on 
nothing but fear of their very own peo-
ple, their own citizens. The fear is what 
drives them to repression, abuse, and 
murder, but time and again they forget 
that someone is always watching. The 
same technology that allows them to 
spy on and manipulate their adver-
saries allows freedom fighters to tweet, 
to live stream, and broadcast some of 
these crimes that are being committed 
by these oppressive regimes. 
The people of Iran and China have 
flung themselves onto the frontline of 
a global fight for individual rights and 
individual freedom, but don’t neglect 
those risking life and limb in places 
like Lebanon, where peaceful opposi-
tion to authorities is labeled as crimi-
nal defamation—imagine that, crimi-
nal defamation if you peacefully op-
pose the authorities—or in Morocco, 
where journalists have been jailed with 
impunity for unveiling corruption. You 
find corruption, you report it in the 
press, and they lock you up for telling 
the truth—or Burma or India or Alge-
ria. There are dozens more examples. 
If you want to understand what is 
happening, look to the people. Listen 
to them and pay attention to their his-
tory as they seek to write their future.

who passed away peacefully on Wednes-
day, January 8, 2020, at the Hot Springs 
County 
Memorial 
Hospital 
in 
Thermopolis, WY. She was surrounded 
by her loving family. 
For many years, Jerry was a domi-
nant force in Wyoming. For the last 12 
years, she was the single most influen-
tial voice with the Wyoming Senate 
delegation. She is my wife Bobbi’s 
mom. Yet Senator ENZI knew her long 
before I did. 
Senator ENZI. 
Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator. 
I got to meet this delightful lady in 
Thermopolis, WY, some 70 years ago. I 
need to tell you a little bit about 
Thermopolis, WY, and how I wound up 
there. 
During the war, my dad was a welder 
on ships, and after the war, he moved 
around the country doing different 
welding projects, one of which took 
him to Thermopolis, WY. He welded on 
the dam there. Dams in the West are 
used to control floods. They are big 
projects, and they have a huge impact 
on communities. This particular one 
not only controlled floods, but it 
turned into a great fishery. 
My folks went to Thermopolis, WY, 
and they also built a trailer park. It 
was the first modern trailer park in 
Thermopolis. By ‘‘modern,’’ I mean 
there was a central building that had 
indoor showers and flush toilets. 
You need to understand a little bit 
about Wyoming. We are small. At that 
time, there were two cities in Wyo-
ming. To be a city, you had to have 
more than 3,000 in population. As soon 
as you had 3,000 in population, you 
could declare yourself a first-class city. 
In those early days, Casper—the energy 
capital at that time—and Cheyenne— 
the State capital at that time—exceed-
ed 3,000. 
What effect did that have on the 
communities? The Presbyterians, the 
Methodists, and the Congregationalists 
got together and divided up the towns 
that were small, realizing that they 
couldn’t support all three churches. 
There was one town that was so small 
that they actually got together and 
formed a community church. 
What is a community church? That is 
where 
these 
three 
denominations 
worked together. At one time, there 
would be a Presbyterian minister who 
was there, and 2 years later, there 
would be a Methodist minister who was 
there and, 2 years later, a Congrega-
tional minister who was there. That is 
where Jerry Brown was the Sunday 
school teacher, and that is how I came 
to meet her.

January 14, 2020 
One of the big realizations, because 
of this community church thing and 
the changing of the pastors every 2 
years, is that I thought every 2 years 
the Lord’s Prayer changed. She helped 
me to understand that dilemma. 
That is where I got to meet Mrs. 
Brown. She was a Sunday school teach-
er, and I wound up in her Sunday 
school class. She taught the kinder-
garten class. When we first started, she 
actually moved up a couple of times 
with me as the classes got combined 
and as I got older. 
At that very first one, for Bible 
school, we held it outdoors underneath 
the pine tree—a huge pine tree. I can 
still 
remember 
sitting 
there, 
en-
thralled with her descriptions as I held 
my New Testament. Of course, since I 
was in kindergarten, I couldn’t read, 
but she filled in for that and gave me a 
great background. 
Later, of course, I ran into a book by 
Robert Fulghum titled, ‘‘All I Really 
Need To Know I Learned in Kinder-
garten.’’ For me, it was kindergarten 
Sunday school. And my teacher, of 
course—well, she was my first Sunday 
school teacher and my last living Sun-
day school teacher. 
Some of the things she taught were 
to share everything; play fair; don’t hit 
people; put things back where you 
found them; clean up your own mess; 
don’t take things that aren’t yours; say 
you are sorry if you hurt someone; and 
be aware of wonder. And ‘‘wonder’’ is, 
if you put some seeds—and we did 
this—in a paper cup with dirt and you 
water it, the plant goes up, and the 
roots go down. Some people would say 
nobody knows why or how, but Mrs. 
Brown said: That is not true. God has a 
plan. He knows you. He watches out for 
you. If you see things going wrong, 
check your direction because it might 
not be where God wants you. 
All of this was a good basis for my 
life. I have always appreciated seeing 
her through the years, particularly 
when we have visited that church 
again, which is still a community 
church, although most of the towns 
have split those up into more than one 
denomination. But I have to say that if 
the criteria is 3,000 people, by the time 
the town gets to a first-class city size, 
the one church is so well established 
that it is hard for another one to actu-
ally get established in a small commu-
nity like that. 
As long as there are wonderful people 
like Mrs. Brown teaching kindergarten, 
first grade, second grade, and other 
kids in small communities, this coun-
try will be a great place. 
I thank her for all the background 
she gave me and ask for your prayers 
for her family. 
I thank the Senator. 
Mr. BARRASSO. I thank Senator 
ENZI. 
She was born May 29, 1930, in Casper, 
WY—the youngest of eight children—to 
the Dodge family. As Senator ENZI 
talked about building the dam in the 
Thermopolis area, the family lived in 
Alcova during the construction of the 
dams and the reservoirs in that area 
before moving to Thermopolis, where 
the family owned and ran the Wigwam 
Bakery. They had the best bread, 
doughnuts, and anything you could 
ever imagine. 
She worked a number of places—cer-
tainly at the family bakery, but also 
she worked at the First National Bank. 
Jerry always volunteered to take the 
mail from the bank to the post office 
because she had caught the eye of a 
young postal employee, Bob Brown. 
The two were married on September 18 
in 1949, and as the Senator knows, they 
recently celebrated their 70th wedding 
anniversary. 
As newlyweds, Bob was sent to 
Korea. He had been in World War II. He 
was sent with a whole group from the 
basin area of Wyoming, as part of the 
National Guard, to Korea. They first 
went to Fort Lewis, WA, and Jerry fol-
lowed. To pay her way, she had to pick 
filbert nuts. She was telling me at 
Christmas the size of the bag that they 
had to fill with these filbert nuts be-
fore they got any pay. Well, it was a 
full day’s work, so the lessons she 
taught Mr. ENZI about hard work, she 
knew it personally. 
She was a hard worker. She worked 
at the bakery. She also worked for Dr. 
Nels Vicklund, Vicklund Pharmacy, in 
Hot Springs County. She worked for 
the Hot Springs County treasurer’s of-
fice. Her really great joy was when she 
owned and operated her own store in 
downtown Thermopolis called Country 
Charm. 
As the Senator knows, she was dedi-
cated to her children, Bobbi and Mike, 
and adored her granddaughter, Hadley. 
She taught them to work hard, to be 
kind, and to always do their best. 
She was a talented crafter, she en-
joyed playing bridge, and she was a col-
lector. She collected Santa Clauses, 
she collected chickens and pictures of 
chickens, and she collected rocks from 
around the world. No matter where I 
went, I needed to bring back a rock for 
Jerry. She also, as the gentleman 
knows, collected friends and memories. 
She had an encyclopedic memory of 
Wyoming names, Wyoming places, and 
Wyoming relationships—who was mar-
ried to whom and whose cousin was 
who. She rarely left anywhere without 
a hug and really loved being everyone’s 
favorite Aunt Jerry. She was also an 
avid reader—and an NBA fan, of all 
things. She loved God, loved America, 
and loved our flag. She was a longtime 
member of the Community Federated 
Church, the Order of the Eastern Star, 
and, as we were talking about in the 
cloakroom, she was State president of 
PEO. 
Jerry Brown dedicated her life to her 
family, to her faith, and to her friends. 
She was committed to her church and 
her community. She had a well-de-
served reputation for being a joiner, a 
goer, and a doer. 
We will celebrate her life on Satur-
day, January 18, in Thermopolis at the 
Community Federated Church, and we 
miss her dearly. May she rest in peace. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
as we go back through the calendar 
just a few months and get some con-
text of what has been building for a 
while, in May of 2019, four different 
vessels that were traveling just outside 
of the Gulf of Oman were hit by mines 
laid by Iranian leadership. In June, 
just a month later, two different ves-
sels hit Iranian mines. Those mines 
weren’t just placed in the water flip-
pantly; they were actually placed on 
the ship. In June of 2019, a U.S. Navy 
surveillance drone was flying through 
the Strait of Hormuz in international 
airspace and was downed by an Iranian 
missile attack. 
As we continue to move forward, we 
tracked an increase in Iranian activity 
in cyber attacks across the United 
States, but at the same time, individ-
uals within our military bases in Iraq 
were facing more and more of a push 
against them in not just an external 
conversation, an actual kinetic attack. 
Our supply lines in the fall of last 
year, as trucks that were leaving from 
Baghdad and driving down to Kuwait 
for our supply lines there, were in-
creasingly facing improvised explosive 
devices, something we had not seen in 
a long time. Those explosive devices 
were created and placed by Shia mili-
tias with materials provided by Iran. 
Then, in October, there were multiple 
attacks on our facility in Baghdad. In 
November, there were multiple attacks 
again on our facility in Baghdad. In 
December, there were multiple attacks 
again, each time increasing with more 
and more attacks. 
We hear that term ‘‘attack,’’ and it 
seems almost flippant, but we realize, 
for the thousands of Americans who 
work in that area of that diplomatic 
mission that is there in Iraq, there is a 
day that happens—it could be the mid-
dle of the night, it could be the middle 
of the afternoon, but a moment hap-
pens, month after month, week after 
week, and sometimes within that, day 
after day—where the sirens go off, and 
everyone on campus runs into a bomb 
shelter, and then the explosions begin 
around the grounds. 
These were not just random attacks. 
These were designed kinetic rocket at-
tacks coming into our Embassy that 
built up toward an attack on the U.S. 
Embassy on December 31, where thou-
sands of people broke through the 
outer section, setting fires to the build-
ing, attacking the facility, smashing

against the glass, trying to get into the 
next layer that they were not able to 
penetrate—into the inner layer in the 
Embassy. But thousands and thousands 
of rioters were moving toward the base. 
As calm was restored on the outside 
and a security perimeter was estab-
lished on the outside, they could read 
what was written on the walls, spray- 
painted 
now 
on 
the 
Embassy: 
‘‘Soleimani is our leader.’’ 
I was interested in talking to a friend 
of mine just a couple of weekends ago, 
and he made an interesting comment 
to me. He said: I didn’t know who 
Qasem Soleimani was. I had never 
heard that name before, and then I 
went back and started doing some re-
search to find out who this guy is and 
what he is all about. 
His comment to me was: I went back 
and did some research and found out he 
is a bad guy. 
I said: Yes, you don’t know the half 
of it. 
Soleimani is the leader of the Quds 
Force for the Iranians, was responsible 
for training the Shia militias in Iraq 
on how to kill Americans. Over 600 
Americans died because of the training 
and equipping that Soleimani did for 
the Iraqis who were fighting against us 
at that time, specifically the Shia mili-
tias that Soleimani actually directed. 
My neighbor was surprised to learn 
that Soleimani was the one who actu-
ally 
organized 
all 
things 
with 
Hezbollah in Lebanon. He had orga-
nized Hezbollah also in Iraq. He is the 
one who was coordinating all that was 
happening in Yemen, in the civil war 
that is currently ongoing in Yemen. 
He was surprised to see that he was 
in Syria working with Bashar Assad 
and to see all that he was doing for 
that ruthless leader that murdered 
thousands of his own people. That was 
Soleimani. 
For those of us who are tracking the 
direct 
threats 
against 
the 
United 
States, we are very aware of who he 
was and what he was all about because 
he was the point person to try to take 
the fight to the United States. In the 
past 6 months, that fight had gone 
from an ‘‘I am going to try to find indi-
viduals within Hezbollah or Shia mili-
tias somewhere to attack the United 
States’’ to being more strategic to 
bringing the attack directly from his 
forces under his command to try to 
take the attack to us. He had become 
more and more overt and more and 
more obsessed with attacking the 
United States. 
Over the course of that time period, 
the Trump administration, over and 
over again, sent a message to the Ira-
nian leadership: You are playing a very 
dangerous game, continually attacking 
American facilities, launching rockets 
randomly in there, starting fires, stir-
ring up militias to attack us at every 
turn, attacking our supply lines. If an 
American is killed, President Trump 
made it very clear, the United States 
will respond. 
In December, Soleimani pushed it to 
a whole new level, with a multiple 
rocket attack into an American facil-
ity, killing an American and wounding 
four others. The President responded 
with a very reasoned response: taking 
an attack to where the Shia militias 
and Hezbollah were storing the muni-
tions they were using to attack us, de-
stroying that facility, destroying those 
munitions, taking the fight to four dif-
ferent training facilities where they 
were equipping the people to bring the 
attack to us but then also tracking 
very carefully the person who was ac-
tually planning the next set of at-
tacks—Soleimani himself. 
The time came in January, when 
Soleimani had been traveling through 
Syria, through Lebanon, working with 
Hezbollah, and then back into Iraq, and 
he was personally meeting with an-
other terrorist leader in Iraq—one ter-
rorist leader, Soleimani, leading a ter-
rorist organization, meeting with an-
other terrorist leading a terrorist orga-
nization there. Both of them were plan-
ning together and met up that morning 
at the airport. A little after 4 o’clock 
in the morning, they left from the air-
port, headed to go have their next 
meeting and planning their next set of 
attacks. 
At that time, the Trump administra-
tion took the opportunity, while they 
were both far from civilians and no one 
else was on the road, to have a surgical 
strike and take out two different ter-
rorist leaders, both in the process of 
planning their next attacks. 
What has been interesting to me has 
been the response of the U.S. Senate 
and the U.S. House and some of the de-
bate there. We should debate issues 
like this. These are difficult moments 
in difficult days. We are not at war 
with Iran, nor should we be at war with 
Iran. There are millions of peaceful 
people in Iran. Thousands and thou-
sands of those people are protesting on 
the streets right now in Iran against 
their own government. They are furi-
ous at the corruption in their govern-
ment. They are furious that the people 
in Iran can’t get food and can’t get fuel 
because the regime there is spending 
their money attacking Yemen, attack-
ing Syria, feeding money to Hezbollah 
and Iraq, feeding money to Hezbollah 
and Lebanon. The money that should 
be going to help their own people, the 
Iranian regime is sending out all over 
the region to spur their terrorism. 
The people there are frustrated and 
upset with their own government, and 
they are taking it to the streets under 
a threat of their own life. In the not- 
too-recent past, Iranians—whether it 
be the Green Revolution 10 years ago 
or just in days past and months past— 
had taken to the streets by the thou-
sands, and some of them have faced all 
kinds of retribution coming back at 
them. 
We should be supporting the good 
people of Iran who are miserable living 
under that regime. We are not at war 
with the people of Iran, but we are very 
clear as a nation, when you are plan-
ning an attack against us, and we are 
aware of that attack and you have 
shown the due diligence to take prior 
attacks, we know you are not just 
thinking about it. You are actually 
planning it and about to carry it out. 
We have learned our lesson from 9/11, 
and for the last three administrations, 
the policy has been very clear. If we 
know you are in the process of bringing 
an attack to us in the days and weeks 
ahead, we will strike first to protect 
American lives. We will not wait until 
you kill Americans to come bring a 
strike to you. That is what happened 
with Soleimani. 
The debate that is happening on the 
floor now about a War Powers Resolu-
tion has been interesting to me because 
much of the language just affirms the 
current law. It almost seems to imply 
the Trump administration didn’t follow 
the law when they did. The Trump ad-
ministration continued to track an im-
minent threat that was coming into 
the United States. There has been some 
argument about how imminent is im-
minent. Some of my colleagues want to 
know that Soleimani was in the proc-
ess of carrying out an attack within 
the next 30 minutes, and if he wasn’t 
carrying out an attack immediately, in 
the 
next 
day 
or 
next 
hours, 
we 
shouldn’t respond. I will tell you, intel-
ligence is not that exquisite. You only 
know in the movies that someone is 
about to attack an exact spot at an 
exact time. That is not real life. With 
real-life intelligence, you gather infor-
mation to track what you think is 
coming, but you don’t get exact dates 
and exact locations like that. 
We knew he was planning this at-
tack. They were zeroing in on the loca-
tions, but he was very specific as to the 
Americans he was coming after. 
To be able to bring the attack to him 
and to notify Congress within 48 hours, 
which is the law, is consistent with the 
War Powers Resolution. The President 
did follow the law. He was justified in 
being able to carry out the strike 
against a known, declared terrorist 
leader—in fact, two of them—in the 
process of planning their next attack 
against Americans. 
The key thing I join my colleagues in 
talking about is not trying to be able 
to press back on the administration 
but to say that none of us want a war 
in Iran, including the Trump adminis-
tration. In every conversation I have 
had with anyone in the administration, 
they have all been very clear. They are 
not planning a war with Iran. They 
don’t want a war with Iran, but they do 
want Iran to stop their belligerent ter-
rorist activities against us, against our 
allies, and against any American they 
seem to find in the region. I join my 
colleagues in warning Iran and assur-
ing Iran at the same time that we have 
no desire for a war with the regime or 
with the good people of Iran. We should 
be able to find a way to work together. 
Since 1979, when this regime was 
coming into power, they have taken 
the fight to Americans and to all of our 
allies. It is time we pushed back and

said: Stop shedding blood, and let’s sit 
down at the table and be able to work 
this out. 
In the meantime, let’s not assume 
that Soleimani was some innocent by-
stander. He had a lot of American 
blood on his hands. Let’s take into real 
life what it really means to live in 
Baghdad and serve in our diplomatic 
mission and hour after hour run to 
bomb shelters as rockets are raining 
down randomly on your facility. There 
is plenty of provocation. Now it is time 
for diplomacy. Let’s get this worked 
out. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, 
I want to say to my colleague from 
Oklahoma that I appreciate his re-
marks. I was on the floor last week 
talking about this issue. He is abso-
lutely right. Soleimani was a recog-
nized terrorist, not by the Trump ad-
ministration but by the global commu-
nity, including the Obama administra-
tion, the United Nations. The two orga-
nizations that he had were both consid-
ered terrorist organizations. He was re-
sponsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
our constituents and thousands more 
who were maimed or injured. 
When I have been at these briefings, 
I am sort of getting a different briefing 
than, apparently, some of my col-
leagues are. The briefings have been 
very explicit about the degree with 
which this particular individual had al-
ready attacked and killed so many 
Americans and, in fact, there were 
more plans, of course, in the future. 
That is why he was traveling around 
the Middle East, meeting with other 
commanders, including the commander 
of the Islamic militia group in Iraq 
that very day. 
I think this is a time for us, as the 
Senator from Oklahoma has said, to be 
sober and to be realistic about the 
great threat that he posed to us, and 
not just in this administration but in 
previous administrations, and now talk 
about a way forward, avoiding war with 
Iran but making sure Iran is held ac-
countable. 
To the people of Iran, I say today 
that we are with you. We understand 
the fact that your country is one where 
your own rights have been repressed 
and you have not had the ability to 
achieve your dreams. We want that for 
you, as well. Our arguments are not 
with you. They are with the Govern-
ment of Iran. 
f 
REMEMBERING CHRIS ALLEN 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about something 
very sad. Last week, my staff and I 
were informed that a colleague of ours, 
Chris Allen, a Senate staffer in the 
Senate 
Finance 
Committee, 
passed 
away unexpectedly. 
Chris was an amazing guy. He was 
diligent, hard-working, and an expert 
on pensions and tax-exempt organiza-
tions. He was a very valued colleague. 
I got to know him particularly well 
over the last couple of years as we 
worked together on pension issues. He 
was the one who, along with Charlie 
Bolton in my office, really focused on 
the complicated issue of multiem-
ployer pensions and other retirement 
security issues. 
We have a crisis in our country right 
now. The pension system is in big trou-
ble. Chris Allen played a pivotal role in 
ensuring that this very important issue 
was brought to the fore and that we 
have responsible solutions for it. He 
was developing a framework to prevent 
the collapse of that longtime employer 
system. He also recently prevented 
pension cuts to over 92,000 retired coal 
miners through his work. He is the one, 
I think, most responsible from all of 
the staff on the Hill for ensuring that 
we expanded 401(k)s to millions of part- 
time workers left behind by current 
law. 
Last month, Congress enacted and 
the President signed the SECURE Act. 
It is going to help millions of Ameri-
cans to have more peace of mind in re-
tirement. I don’t believe it would have 
passed the Senate at the end of last 
year but for Chris. That is how impor-
tant he was. Through his quick wit and 
tenacity, he is the one who built the 
coalitions to get that done, and he 
built the momentum for it when, 
frankly, a lot of others had given up. 
As a result, all Americans are better 
off. 
In this difficult time, my thoughts 
and my prayers are with his wife 
Lynda-Marie, his daughters Sophie and 
Lucie, and all of his family and his 
many, many friends, as we mourn the 
loss of a true public servant. I also 
want to express condolences to Chair-
man GRASSLEY and the entire staff of 
the Senate Finance Committee. 
Chris will be dearly missed as a 
friend, a retirement expert, and a 
model public servant. 
f 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about the path for-
ward on legislation and commonsense 
solutions that my constituents and all 
of our constituents would like to see 
this year. The Senators in this Cham-
ber came back to town this week, along 
with Members of the House, at one of 
the most partisan times in our Na-
tion’s history. 
We just learned that the House is 
now going to send us Articles of Im-
peachment. This will be the third Pres-
idential impeachment trial in our en-
tire history and only the second one in 
the last 151 years. 
It will be the most partisan one ever. 
I agree with the NANCY PELOSI of a 
year ago, who said: ‘‘Impeachment is so 
divisive to the country that unless 
there is something so compelling and 
overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t 
think we should go down that path be-
cause it divides the country.’’ I think 
she was right about that. Yet, unfortu-
nately, without meeting those criteria, 
here we are going down that path. 
While we face a lot of contentious 
issues ahead of us, I still believe we can 
legislate for the benefit of the people 
we represent, and we must. That is our 
job. We can’t let partisanship cause us 
to lose sight of all the opportunities we 
have here every day to come together, 
to find common ground, and to pass 
commonsense solutions to address the 
issues 
our 
constituents 
care 
most 
about. 
In fact, I would say that under the 
radar and without fanfare, we have re-
cently done that. At end of last year, 
we enacted a number of bills and provi-
sions on a bipartisan basis that helped 
people. I talked about the SECURE Act 
a moment ago. Despite the headlines 
about gridlock and dysfunction and im-
peachment, we have been working on 
both sides of the aisle to find solutions 
to some of these real problems—like 
growing our economy, protecting na-
tional security, promoting conserva-
tion, or helping the most vulnerable. 
f 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, one 
area where this Senate and the Con-
gress, in general, along with the ad-
ministration, have made significant 
progress is combating the ongoing drug 
addiction crisis in America that has af-
fected so many families represented by 
all of us in this Chamber. 
In my home State of Ohio, we have 
been on the frontline of this crisis for 
years. Opioids, in particular, have 
taken a heavy toll in our communities. 
In fact, in 2017, our opioid overdose 
rate in Ohio was almost three times 
the national average, with nearly a 
dozen Ohioans dying from these dan-
gerous drugs every single day, making 
it the No. 1 cause of death in Ohio, sur-
passing car accidents. 
Since 2017, we have begun to make 
progress, finally, to be able to turn the 
tide on opioids. In 2018, after a decade 
of increased overdose deaths every year 
for the previous dozen years, we finally 
had a reduction, a 22-percent reduction 
in overdose deaths. By the way, that 
led the Nation in terms of the percent 
decrease. It is still way too high—unac-
ceptably high—but we are starting to 
make progress. 
A lot of it goes back to what is being 
done here at the Federal level, but also 
the State level and local level, to ad-
dress this problem. We have dramati-
cally increased funding here for treat-
ment for recovery, including providing 
Narcan as a way to save people’s lives. 
It is a miracle drug that reverses the 
effects of an overdose. We have done 
some things that are very important. 
More recently, we have sent these re-
sources through legislation that the 
President signed into law just last 
year. There are resources also provided 
by the State opioid response grants and 
also by our bipartisan Comprehensive 
Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, 
helping our first responders to be able

to use innovative and new approaches 
to 
ensure 
that 
individuals 
whose 
overdoses are reversed go into treat-
ment rather than just overdosing again 
and again. 
The good news is that at the end of 
the year, the spending bill that Con-
gress passed secured a record $658 mil-
lion in funding for these Comprehen-
sive 
Addiction 
and 
Recovery 
Act 
grants, or CARA grants. I was the au-
thor of that legislation, initially, along 
with SHELDON WHITEHOUSE on the other 
side of the aisle. We started off with 
closer to $200 million. Now, we are at 
$658 million. Why? Because it is work-
ing. 
I have been back home, going from 
place to place, seeing how it works. I 
have watched some of these first re-
sponders in action with social workers 
and treatment providers who are going 
into people’s homes and getting people 
into treatment who previously were 
not. We can’t rest on our laurels be-
cause we have to do a lot more to ad-
dress all forms of addiction that are in-
creasingly becoming a problem. 
We have seen in Ohio and around the 
country that psychostimulants have 
now come back with a vengeance. This 
would be crystal meth from Mexico and 
cocaine. It is surging in communities 
across our State. According to our dep-
uty attorney general in Ohio, law en-
forcement officials in 2018 tested dou-
ble the amount of methamphetamine 
samples as they had in 2017 and triple 
the amount from 2016. In other words, 
crystal meth is growing. Higher and 
higher amounts of it are coming in and 
more and more people are being af-
fected by this. I heard this at round-
table discussions around the State. 
I was in Knox County last year, 
learning that the prosecutor’s office es-
timates that 80 to 90 percent of all drug 
incidents 
included 
crystal 
meth. 
Opioids used to be their biggest prob-
lem in Knox County, as it has been in 
all 80 counties in Ohio until recently. 
Now it is pure crystal meth coming in 
from Mexico. 
I am pleased that the spending bill at 
the end of last year that we passed just 
last month changed the way in which 
our funding is delivered in the fight 
against 
addiction. 
Specifically, 
in-
cluded in that is my Combating Meth 
and Cocaine Act. This is an important 
bill that allows States the flexibility 
to use the roughly $1.5 billion in grant 
funds allocated specifically to combat 
opioids. The 21st Century Cures grants, 
now called the State response grants, 
can all be used for the treatment and 
recovery services for new threats like 
crystal meth and cocaine. 
Giving our local communities that 
flexibility is incredibly important. I 
have heard it constantly when I am 
back home. We have now done that. We 
have been able to help even further to 
try to reverse the effects, not just of 
the opioid crisis but of the drug crisis 
and all forms of addiction. 
We have made significant strides in 
ensuring that we can respond to this 
ever-changing addiction crisis. I am 
proud we are able to do it. As I said at 
the beginning of this speech, this is a 
pretty divisive time in Washington, to 
say the least. No one can deny that. 
What I hoped to show by highlighting 
these achievements over the past year 
is that even in a highly partisan envi-
ronment, it is possible to bring people 
together to get things done and pass 
laws that make a fundamental im-
provement to the lives of the people we 
represent. 
While lots of time finding that com-
mon ground takes more work, it is 
worth it. The extra effort goes a long 
way. Fortunately, we are coming into 
this new session of Congress having al-
ready laid the groundwork that we 
need to do to continue to fight this ad-
diction crisis. 
Critical right now to that fight is 
passing bipartisan legislation that will 
help us to push back against a par-
ticular kind of opioid, the synthetic 
opioid called fentanyl. Fentanyl came 
on the scene 5 or 6 years ago with a 
vengeance. Just as we were making 
progress on reducing the use of heroin 
and prescription drugs, suddenly, this 
fentanyl arrives. It is a synthetic 
opioid. It is 50 times more powerful on 
average than heroin. It is now the No. 
1 killer. It has been the last few years. 
In States like mine, Ohio, when you 
look at the numbers over the past few 
years, 
although 
we 
are 
making 
progress on other opioids, we are not 
making progress on fentanyl. Why? Be-
cause it is being mixed into all kinds of 
other drugs, including crystal meth, in-
cluding opioids, including all street 
drugs. The improvements we have seen 
are significant, but fentanyl continues 
to be the No. 1 killer. 
Fentanyl, unfortunately, knows no 
ZIP Code and is devastating individuals 
and families all across the country. Ac-
cording to the most recent data avail-
able from the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, there were 72,000 
drug-related 
deaths 
in 
the 
United 
States in 2017, and 40 percent of those 
deaths were involving fentanyl. That 
data showed that the overdose deaths 
due to fentanyl had increased at a rate 
of 88 percent per year, on average, 
since 2013. 
It is a real threat to our States. In 
2017 alone, we had a record 3,500 over-
dose deaths in Ohio that were attrib-
utable to fentanyl. Last fall, our Nar-
cotics and Gun Enforcement Task 
Force seized 45 pounds of fentanyl in a 
single bust in Montgomery County, in 
Dayton, OH. There was enough of the 
drug to kill the entire population of 
Ohio. 
That is why the Drug Enforcement 
Agency made the right call in 2018 to 
make fentanyl-related substances ille-
gal to possess, transport, or manufac-
ture. This means they have been sched-
uled. Thanks to that designation, our 
law enforcement officials have been 
able to better protect our communities 
by 
seizing 
and 
destroying 
large 
amounts of these fentanyl-related sub-
stances, which are the analogs to 
fentanyl. So that is good. 
Unfortunately, due to Federal law, 
the DEA was only able to make these 
dangerous substances illegal on a tem-
porary basis. Think about that. You 
have this deadly drug that is 50 times 
more powerful than heroin. Back in 
2018, we were able to finally make not 
just fentanyl but all of its analogs— 
fentanyl-related 
substances—illegal. 
Law enforcement was using that to 
begin to push back, and now we find it 
was only temporary. Guess what. We 
are fast approaching the end of that 
designation. Next month, on February 
6, which is 3 weeks from this Thursday, 
fentanyl-related substances will once 
again be legal, and it will be much 
harder to keep vulnerable communities 
safe from these deadly substances. We 
cannot let that happen. 
I met earlier today with former Iowa 
Governor Terry Branstad, who is now 
our Ambassador to China. For years, 
many of us have been pushing China to 
do more to crack down on fentanyl be-
cause most of the fentanyl that comes 
to this country and kills individuals in 
our communities comes from China. 
Most of it has been coming through our 
mail system. We have done a lot to 
stop that. We have passed the STOP 
Act, which tightens up the post office’s 
screening process, which has worked 
very well over the last year. We have 
also provided more money under the 
INTERDICT Act in order to provide 
better equipment not just to our Postal 
Service but also to the private carriers 
like DHL and FedEx. 
What has happened is, China has also 
done a better job of making fentanyl il-
legal and scheduling the precursors and 
analogs to fentanyl, and we have 
pushed them very hard on that. I have 
myself been to China and have person-
ally done that, and I know Ambassador 
Branstad has pushed China hard on 
this. Finally, China has begun to start 
addressing this rampant production in 
its country. 
Terry Branstad told me today—and I 
agree with him—that the credibility of 
the United States to continue to pro-
vide pressure to China to do the right 
thing will be eroded dramatically if we 
don’t continue to schedule fentanyl. As 
we are asking China to do it, we cannot 
let this designation lapse here. Obvi-
ously, what is most important is that 
we not let it lapse because it is the 
wrong thing to do and because it will 
affect all of our communities and all of 
our families who have been affected by 
this dangerous drug. 
We can’t let it happen. That is why, 
last fall, Senator JOE MANCHIN and I in-
troduced a bill called FIGHT Fentanyl, 
which codifies the Drug Enforcement 
Agency’s precedent to permanently 
schedule fentanyl-related substances. 
So forget these temporary designations 
that have caused these issues; let’s per-
manently schedule these fentanyl-re-
lated substances. 
It has very strong bipartisan support. 
In fact, as of a couple of weeks ago,

every single U.S. State’s and terri-
tory’s attorney general has now en-
dorsed our bill. That is all 50 States 
and 6 territories. That doesn’t happen 
very often. This is a bipartisan group 
of law enforcement officials who has 
said: We support this legislation, the 
FIGHT Fentanyl Act, that we intro-
duced last fall. I am confident we can 
get it passed if it comes to the floor for 
a vote. There are other approaches to 
it as well that are slightly different 
than ours. I support those as well. 
The point is, we need to pass legisla-
tion to ensure that February 6 doesn’t 
come and go without our scheduling 
these fentanyl analogs. It is a good ex-
ample of the need to continue working 
across the aisle on this issue. We have 
done a good job with it so far. As I have 
said, even in these contentious times, 
we have to do it again, and we have to 
do it soon. I am told that during im-
peachment, it is impossible or at least 
very difficult to legislate on any other 
topic without having unanimous con-
sent. So we need to get this done before 
next week, before we get the Articles of 
Impeachment and before the U.S. Sen-
ate begins the impeachment trial. 
I urge all of our colleagues to focus 
today on this issue. Join us in this 
commonsense, lifesaving legislation. 
Let’s work together. The Committee 
on the Judiciary has been working on 
this, and others have worked on this. 
We have legislation at the desk to be 
able to solve it. I hope we can do it by 
unanimous consent, but we have to do 
it. This is lifesaving legislation to keep 
fentanyl from spreading its poison even 
further. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
f 
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF 
MILITARY FORCE 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, whether it 
is tomorrow, later today, or sometime 
next week, I know there will be an ef-
fort here to restrict the President’s 
ability to engage the Armed Forces of 
the United States in a conflict with 
Iran. 
I think, any time you have some-
thing like that come up, there are two 
most important questions that need to 
be answered: No. 1, Why? Why do we 
need this law that you are pursuing? 
No. 2, What would that law do? Let me 
try to answer the ‘‘why.’’ I can deduce 
two separate arguments. 
The first is the argument that some-
how the actions of the United States, 
for example, of pursuing a maximum 
pressure campaign against Iran and 
leaving the Iran deal—according to at 
least the language of the version I saw, 
which I know is going to be amended— 
have included economic, diplomatic, 
and military pressure and that this is 
raising the risk of retaliation against 
U.S. troops and personnel, which will 
lead to a cycle of escalating back-and- 
forth violence between Iran and its 
proxies and the United States, and that 
these warnings have been proven to be 
correct. I guess the first argument is 
that we left the Iran deal and that this 
is the reason we are now on the verge 
of what some view to be an all-out war 
against Iran. 
The second argument is rooted in the 
constitutional views that some of my 
colleagues hold that Congress has a 
role to play and that no extended mili-
tary engagement should be allowed 
without there being congressional ap-
proval. These are two separate motiva-
tions, and I think it is possible to hold 
that second position and also be moti-
vated by the first. I think, for many of 
my colleagues, it is solely a constitu-
tional question, which I respect. So 
let’s analyze the ‘‘why’’ for a second. 
First of all, I think it is just not true 
that the reason Iran and its proxies are 
trying to kill Americans is that we 
pulled out of the Obama deal with Iran. 
Iran has most certainly responded with 
violence to our decision, but that is not 
what motivated Iran. For example, be-
fore there was even an Iran deal from 
which to pull out, it was already equip-
ping and supplying Shia militias in 
Iraq with weapons that killed and 
maimed Americans in the hundreds. In 
fact, Iran’s antagonism toward us pre-
dates any discussion about an Iran 
deal. It predates our presence in the re-
gion and the numbers that we cur-
rently have there. I think it is also 
flawed because, during the Iran deal— 
even when the Iran deal was in place— 
Iran was still sponsoring all of the 
same proxy groups with all of the same 
weapons and was undertaking all of the 
same targeting. 
One of the flaws of the Iran deal and 
one of the reasons the Iran deal was 
not a good one was that it actually 
didn’t deal with this activity. The only 
thing it dealt with was enrichment. It 
did nothing to limit Iran’s missile pro-
gram, and it did nothing to limit Iran’s 
sponsorship of terrorism. In fact, the 
only impact it had on its missile pro-
gram and on its sponsorship of ter-
rorism was that it provided economic 
activity that generated revenue to fund 
those things. 
Despite the denial and the repeated 
and bold-faced lies of some who have 
gone on TV and have said: Oh, there 
was never any cash transfer, there ab-
solutely was. There was over $1 billion 
delivered to the Iranians. They say 
these were funds that had been frozen. 
They say this was their money and 
that this is why it was released to 
them as part of this deal. The Iranians 
don’t tell you that there is close to $50 
billion in unpaid claims that have been 
adjudicated in U.S. courts on behalf of 
Americans who have suffered at the 
hands of Iranian terror and who have 
not been paid. 
Suffice it to say that the Iran deal 
was flawed. One of the reasons it was 
flawed is that it did nothing to prohibit 
the sponsorship of terrorism, and it ac-
tually generated economic activity and 
the delivery of over $1 billion in cash. 
I assure you this was not used to build 
bridges, roads, and schools but was 
used to fund these nefarious activities 
that Iran undertook before the Iran 
deal, during the Iran deal, and after the 
Iran deal. 
So the fact that Iran is responding 
with violence to economic sanctions, 
which by itself is unacceptable, tells us 
the nature of this regime is to respond 
to economic sanctions—not to military 
action—with violence and efforts to 
kill Americans. It doesn’t mean this is 
the reason Iran was doing that. Iran 
was already doing that. It has just been 
part of its response. 
This leads me to the second point. 
Iran has already been doing it because 
Iran’s goal is not simply to get us back 
into the Iran deal; its goal is to drive 
us from the region. Iran does not want 
an American presence there, and it 
does not want American influence in 
the region. Iran does not want it in 
Iraq, which it has been against from 
the very beginning, and it doesn’t want 
it in Syria. Yet it is not just limited to 
Iraq and Syria. Iran doesn’t want our 
presence in Jordan, in Kuwait, or in 
Bahrain. It doesn’t want any American 
presence in Afghanistan. It doesn’t 
want us anywhere in the region be-
cause Iran views it as an impediment 
to its desire to be a dominant regional 
power, and Iran views it as an impedi-
ment to its ultimate design of destroy-
ing the Jewish State. 
Iran decided not last week, not last 
year, and not at the beginning of the 
Trump Presidency but well over a dec-
ade and a half ago that the way it was 
going to get us to leave the region was 
by 
inflicting 
costs—i.e., 
with 
the 
deaths and the injuries of American 
service men and women—and that Iran 
would make it so painful for us to be 
there and so painful for these countries 
to host us that we would ultimately 
leave. That is the reason Iran is under-
taking these attacks. 
Now, why are we there? It is a good 
question and a valid one to answer, and 
I will answer it in the cases of both 
Syria and Iraq. 
We are not there on an anti-Iran 
campaign the way in which some de-
scribe. There is an element of prohib-
iting Iran from capturing Iraq and 
turning it into a puppet state. By the 
way, many Shia politicians in Iraq 
share that view. They may not want us 
to be the protector, at least openly, but 
they are nationalists just like they are 
Shia. 
The fundamental and the principal 
reason we are in Iraq is as part of 
NATO’s anti-ISIS mission and as a 
train-and-equip mission. We are there 
to train and equip Iraqis to fight 
against ISIS. It has been an effort that 
has been successful. It has worked. It is 
interesting that for a time, when Iran 
shared the same fears of ISIS, you saw 
Iran sort of stand down a little bit. 
Even after we pulled out of the Iran 
deal, Iran pulled back a little bit be-
cause it, too, wanted ISIS defeated. 
Now it argues that, in its mind, ISIS 
has been diminished and that it is time

January 14, 2020 
for the Americans to go. If you will not 
leave on your own, then we are going 
to start killing people until you decide 
the price of being here is too high. 
Here is the bottom line. The reason 
there are American troops in large 
parts of this region is for an anti-terror 
campaign. Iran has decided to use prox-
ies and these deniable attacks—by ‘‘de-
niable,’’ I mean getting some other 
group to use the weapons you gave 
them to attack Americans—so Iran can 
say: It was not us, even though every-
one knows it is Iran. That way, you can 
sort of try to avoid a direct war with 
the United States and international 
condemnation, but everyone knows it 
is you. That is why Iran is attacking 
us. 
Now, I ask you: What is supposed to 
be the U.S. response? 
First of all, it is in the law. It is a 
constitutional requirement, and the 
power resides in the Presidency—the 
right to defend U.S. service men and 
women when they come under attack. 
No. 1, there is a constitutional power 
and, in my mind, an obligation to de-
fend, to prevent, to repel, and to re-
spond to attacks against American 
troops who are deployed abroad. 
No. 2, it is embedded in congressional 
authorization for that anti-terror mis-
sion to begin with. In both Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, we are present at the au-
thorization given by Congress over a 
decade and a half ago, and imbedded in 
that authorization is the right to self- 
defense. 
The third point I would make is that 
if you look at this argument about 
AUMF, you would think what we are 
seeing here looks something like the 
run-up to the Iraq war or the run-up to 
the Afghanistan war. This is complete 
fiction. The Afghanistan war was one 
in which the Bush White House came 
to the Congress back then and said: 
Look, the Taliban is allowing al-Qaida 
to act with impunity from its terri-
tory, and we are going to go take them 
out. It was an offensive operation—an 
invasion. With Iraq, we all know the 
justification, which turned out not to 
be the case, about weapons of mass de-
struction and the like—again, an offen-
sive military operation. 
No one in American politics whom I 
see—certainly no one in the Trump ad-
ministration—has 
talked 
about 
ramping up and sending 150,000 or 
200,000 troops marching into Tehran. 
No one is contemplating that. The only 
thing the Trump administration has 
talked about is that if you attack our 
troops or if we think you are getting 
ready to attack our troops, we are 
going to prevent it if we can. We are 
going to repel that attack if it hap-
pens, and we are going to respond pro-
portionately in return as a deterrent. 
You don’t need congressional author-
ization to do that. 
Imagine the practical implications if 
that were the case. The President of 
the United States would have to come 
to Congress on December 30 because we 
are under attack and ask us to recon-
vene; everybody fly in, take a vote, de-
bate for a week and a half, and then de-
cide. By that time we would have 300 
dead Americans. It is ridiculous. It is 
not a requirement. It is not even prac-
tical. 
So I don’t understand the purpose of 
this AUMF. What war are you trying to 
prevent? Unless you believe that we 
brought this upon ourselves because we 
pulled out of the Iran deal—even if you 
believe that one of the reasons we 
stayed in the Iran deal was to prevent 
these sorts of attacks, which I don’t 
think is justified—it is not a justified 
argument by the very fact that even 
during the Iran deal they were already 
doing some of these things and have a 
long history of doing that. If you argue 
it and believe it, you can’t argue that 
attacking and killing Americans—vio-
lence—is an appropriate response to 
economic sanctions. You most cer-
tainly cannot argue that we cannot 
have a military response to protect our 
men and women and our interests in 
the region. Yet that seems to be the ar-
gument embedded in the AUMF. 
Some will state that all it does is re-
state law, and it doesn’t have any prac-
tical impact in the end. If the House 
doesn’t pass the same thing, what is 
this really going to mean? That is true 
in a legal perspective. Let me state 
what the headlines already say and are 
going to say. Here is what they are 
going to say: ‘‘Congress votes to limit 
President’s military options’’ or ‘‘Con-
gress votes to limit Trump’s ability to 
respond militarily to Iran.’’ 
I want to be clear because I have 
heard this from others—the fact that 
they were being told not to debate this 
issue. Debate all you want, but those 
headlines and how they are read in 
places like Iran are very different than 
the debate we are having here. How 
they would read it is that the Presi-
dent has political domestic constraints 
about how much he can respond to 
what they do. 
We already have a fundamental prob-
lem with Iran, and that is, unlike 
many countries in the world, they 
don’t view or respond to things in the 
same way. For example, it is pretty 
clear that their view of what they can 
get away with is much higher than the 
reality of what they can get away with, 
as evidenced by the increasing scale 
and increasing magnitude of the at-
tacks that their proxies were taking 
against the United States and the re-
gion. So the threat of miscalculation 
on their part is very, very high. Let’s 
not forget that just a week ago they 
launched over a dozen rockets at a U.S. 
military installation where, by the 
grace of God, no one was killed. But 
they could have been. You don’t launch 
that many rockets at a U.S. military 
installation and not expect that some 
Americans are going to die. So their in-
ternal calculus about what they can 
get away with is already twisted. 
Imagine adding to that the percep-
tion that somehow the President’s 
hands are tied: No matter what we do, 
we can kill 100 Americans because he is 
really not going to be able to do very 
much because the Congress took away 
his power. 
You can take the chance that these 
guys are somehow legal scholars in 
schools in the American legal system. 
You can take the chance that they 
read Congressional Quarterly or what-
ever publication or that they have read 
the latest issue of whatever the con-
gressional research office has produced 
for the practical implications or you 
can worry that they will misinterpret 
this vote and its impact for what it 
means to what they can get away with. 
If you want to have a debate, have it. 
I don’t know what you are going to 
have a debate about. There is no one 
planning an all-out war against Iran. 
The administration’s strategy is pretty 
straightforward: If they attack us or 
are getting ready to attack us, we will 
respond. If they don’t, we won’t. 
The question of whether there is 
going to be armed conflict between the 
United States and Iran is not in the 
hands of the White House; it is in the 
hands of the Ayatollah. I assure you, 
no matter what we vote on here, it is 
not going to impact their decision over 
there. 
No one—no one I know of—wants a 
war with Iran. That is not the goal. 
The goal, hopefully, is to have an Iran 
that doesn’t sponsor terrorism, that 
doesn’t want nuclear weapons, and that 
acts like a normal country. I bet that 
is the goal of millions of Iranians 
themselves. 
In the interim, until that day comes, 
we have an obligation to protect our 
interests. We have an obligation to pro-
tect our men and women whom we 
have sent into harm’s way. For the life 
of me, I just don’t understand what 
this AUMF seeks to prevent—a war 
that no one is calling for. 
I don’t want to imply that we can’t 
have these debates in America, because 
we can and we should. We are a free so-
ciety. But I want everybody to be clear 
about how these debates can be mis-
interpreted and how these headlines 
can be misinterpreted by the people 
who actually have these rockets and 
control these proxy groups. 
The bottom line is that Iran’s goal is 
not just to get us back into the nuclear 
deal; their goal is to drive us from the 
region. They want us out, and they 
have concluded that the way to do that 
is to use other groups whom they are 
arming and equipping with increas-
ingly more and more capabilities, 
meaning bigger and deadlier ammuni-
tions and rockets and the like to kill 
Americans, and the more Americans 
who die—even if they are there on an 
anti-terror mission—the likelier it is 
that we are going to have to pull them 
out of there. That is what they want. 
They want us to leave Iraq so that they 
can turn it into a puppet State. 
They want all NATO and allied pres-
ence out of Syria so that they can con-
trol Syria entirely. They want to frac-
ture our relationship with Lebanon so

that Hezbollah can control that coun-
try. They want to destroy our presence 
in Bahrain, where the Fifth Fleet is lo-
cated. You can go on and on. 
In the end, I think the question be-
comes, Are we prepared to retreat from 
that region entirely? You cannot come 
here and criticize the President for re-
moving troops from the Syrian-Turk-
ish border and abandoning the Kurds 
and at the same time argue: But you 
don’t have the power unless we author-
ize you to defend those very troops if 
they come under attack by some Ira-
nian proxy group. Yet that seems to be 
the argument. 
You cannot argue: We cannot just 
pick up and leave the Iraqis at the 
mercy of the Iranian regime. I assure 
you that if the President announced to-
morrow ‘‘I am pulling out of Iraq’’ or if 
he said before the Soleimani strike ‘‘I 
am pulling out of Iraq,’’ the floor 
would be filled with people saying that 
we have abandoned our allies; we have 
abandoned the Kurds in Northern Iraq; 
we have abandoned the Sunnis, who are 
scared of the Iranians. 
You cannot argue that and argue at 
the same time that you think we need 
to be present and continue to work to-
ward the functionality of that State 
and at the same time say: But you need 
congressional approval to act in de-
fense of the people we send there who 
wear the uniform—or our diplomats, 
for that matter. Yet that seems to be 
the argument behind this AUMF. 
The vote is going to be what it is. We 
are going to have this debate. I remem-
ber about a year and a half ago, when 
tensions were high with North Korea, 
they wanted an AUMF for that. 
You can disagree with this White 
House all you want. I don’t think we 
have had a more anti-war President in 
my lifetime than the one we have right 
now. If you think about it for a mo-
ment, almost any other predecessor 
may have responded with a lot less re-
straint to some of the provocations and 
attacks we have seen from Iran and its 
proxies. He acted in a way that I think 
history will fully justify and in defense 
of 
American 
lives 
in 
taking 
out 
Soleimani and disrupting a near-term 
plot that could have very easily have 
killed dozens, if not hundreds, of Amer-
icans in the near term. 
I chuckle when I hear people saying: 
Well, how do we know what Soleimani 
was doing? Well, that was his full-time 
job. He wasn’t a stockbroker or realtor 
or diplomat. His full-time job was to 
travel the world to set up groups and 
equip groups so that when he told them 
to go, they could go kill Americans. 
That was his full-time job. That is 
what he was doing there. 
I believe when all is said and done, 
history will fully vindicate the deci-
sion that was made. 
We will have this debate at some 
point. I imagine that at some point it 
will move to the floor. It is a privileged 
resolution. I just think it is short-
sighted, and I hope that some of my 
colleagues who have signed on to it 
thinking that somehow we were exert-
ing Congress’s constitutional author-
ity—I have no problem with asserting 
Congress’s 
constitutional 
authority 
when it is actually being challenged, 
but there is no congressional constitu-
tional authority that can prevent a 
President or should prevent a Presi-
dent from acting in defense of our men 
and women in uniform when we deploy 
them abroad. In my view, that is what 
this bill, which will shortly be before 
us, does. That is the practical implica-
tion of it, so I hope those who chose to 
be for it will reconsider. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to express my oppo-
sition to the War Powers Act resolu-
tion that is making its way through 
Congress. I believe it is designed to 
hurt our President politically, while 
inflicting long-term damage to our na-
tional security and military readiness. 
Iranian provocation is nothing new. 
In the last several months, they have 
drastically and intentionally escalated 
tensions in the region. After several 
measured responses, President Trump 
made the appropriate decision to elimi-
nate General Soleimani, a terrorist 
mastermind who ordered and helped 
carry out many attacks on American 
personnel and our allies. 
I want to emphasize an overlooked 
point here. General Soleimani was 
killed in Iraq, not Iran. He was in Iraq, 
in a car with another known terrorist, 
driving to meet militia members who 
recently fired rockets at Americans, 
killing an American contractor with 
rocket fire, and tried to storm our Em-
bassy. I am going to remind everybody 
that our Embassy in Baghdad is sov-
ereign U.S. territory. 
Whether through an existing author-
ization to use military force or the War 
Powers Act, President Trump was well 
within his legal bounds to take action 
against a known terrorist sitting in 
Iraq plotting attacks against U.S. citi-
zens. It would have been culpable neg-
ligence to not act on the intelligence 
informing us of General Soleimani’s 
position, location, and his imminent 
plans to attack again soon. I thank 
God the days of appeasement are be-
hind us and we learned from history. 
President 
Trump 
averted 
another 
Benghazi-like tragedy. 
The President made Iranian leader-
ship pay a price for its aggression. His 
decisive action made Iran realize that 
the cost of escalation was more than 
they can afford, and it worked. With-
out the loss of American life, while fol-
lowing our Constitution and laws, 
President Trump deescalated tensions 
with Iran and, through a clear message 
of strength, made war less likely. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
this issue know all of this well. They 
watched it play out in real time, just 
like the rest of us. Yet, whether it is 
their deeply rooted disdain for this 
President or a misunderstanding of the 
threats that the United States faces 
every day, they want to limit the 
President’s ability to protect Ameri-
cans abroad. 
The legislation they are promoting 
requires termination or in some cases 
complete withdrawal of our forces 
without any strategic or tactical con-
siderations. Such actions are not based 
on military doctrine, the recommenda-
tions of senior military leaders, or even 
foreign policy experts; they would be 
based solely on politics and would con-
stitute a strategic long-term loss in ex-
change for what they think would be a 
short-term political win. 
Ultimately, my colleagues who sup-
port this resolution refuse to accept 
the undeniable reality that the concept 
of peace through strength works. Re-
moving the powers and capabilities of 
our military leaders that keep our 
country safe will not make us safer. 
Whether through personal animosity 
toward our President or a misunder-
standing of the importance of deterring 
our enemies, some in this Chamber are 
advocating for changes that would 
make our country less safe. I will not 
support their efforts, and I urge the 
rest of my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last 
week, the Senate Finance Committee 
voted 
on 
the 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement. It is called USMCA. I did 
something I have never done. I voted 
for it. I have never voted for a trade 
agreement in my time in the House of 
Representatives and my time in the 
Senate. In fact, I helped to lead the op-
position to the original NAFTA among 
freshmen Members of Congress because 
I recognized that every single one of 
these trade agreements basically had 
the template of corporate interests at 
the center of them. In other words, 
these trade agreements—whether it 
was NAFTA, or the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, whether a half 
generation later it was the Central 
America 
Free 
Trade 
Agreement, 
whether it was the free trade agree-
ment with South Korea, or whether it 
was the Permanent Normal Trade Re-
lations with China—all of them were 
written by corporate interests serving 
the profitability of the executives and

the major stockholders of these compa-
nies. 
They all tended to precipitate this 
under these trade agreements in this 
Congress, under Presidents of both par-
ties, I might add. I disagreed with the 
first President Bush, then President 
Clinton, then the second President 
Bush, and then President Obama. All of 
them would submit trade agreements 
that were written for corporate inter-
ests, I believe, at the expense of work-
ers. 
What happened, typically, was that 
companies that lobbied Congress to 
pass these trade agreements would 
shut down production in Provo, UT, in 
the Presiding Officer’s State, or Cleve-
land or Dayton, in my State. They 
would shut down production there, 
move their production overseas, get 
their tax breaks, and get their low- 
wage labor, often worked on by—al-
most always—nonunion workers, some-
times underage workers who were very 
inexpensive. The products would be 
manufactured and then sold back into 
the United States. That became the 
business model for company after com-
pany after company since the North 
American 
Free 
Trade 
Agreement, 
where corporations outsourced jobs in 
order to save money, always at the ex-
pense of communities, particularly in 
the industrial Midwest, always at the 
expense of workers, and always at the 
expense of the middle class. 
It was welcome news to me when 
Candidate Trump, with whom I agree 
with on almost nothing, said he would 
renegotiate the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. So I tried to work 
with him. I told him that I supported 
his renegotiation. 
I 
worked 
with 
Ambassador 
Lighthizer, the Trade Representative, 
the Ambassador for President Trump— 
the so-called U.S. Trade Representa-
tive. I said to them that we want work-
ers to be the centerpiece of this trade 
agreement. 
Well, what happened? A year into his 
Presidency, President Trump proposed 
the same kind of trade agreement that 
we had seen all along—a trade agree-
ment where corporations were at the 
center of the agreement and workers 
were betrayed. 
This is a President who has betrayed 
workers day after day after day. He re-
fused to raise the minimum wage. He 
cut overtime pay for 50,000 Ohio work-
ers. He put people in the courts who 
put a thumb on the scales of justice, 
choosing corporations over workers 
and choosing Wall Street over con-
sumers. It is a White House that looks 
like a retreat for Wall Street execu-
tives except on Tuesdays and Fridays, 
when it looks like a retreat for a drug 
company executive. That is what the 
President proposed. 
Speaker PELOSI, Senator WYDEN and 
I, 
and 
worker 
representatives—the 
AFL–CIO, the UAW, the CWA, the ma-
chinists, 
and 
the 
steelworkers—all 
said: No, we are not going to support 
another trade agreement that sends 
jobs overseas. We want a trade agree-
ment written for workers. 
We said to the President and the 
President’s Trade Representative: We 
are not going to support this unless 
you include strong labor enforcement 
standards for workers. 
They basically ignored us. We had 
tried to work with them. They basi-
cally ignored us. They insisted we pass 
their bill. 
Finally, after a year—more than a 
year—the administration came along 
kicking and screaming and agreed with 
us 
only 
because 
they 
knew 
they 
couldn’t pass a trade agreement with-
out it. 
It took the language that Senator 
WYDEN and I submitted for workers. It 
works in this way: For the first time, a 
worker is empowered to challenge the 
violation of labor law. So a Mexican 
worker, where the company has broken 
the law by paying them a sub-min-
imum wage, where the company has 
broken the law by refusing them to or-
ganize or to allow unions to attempt to 
organize, where a company breaks the 
law on worker safety—a worker at that 
company, anonymously, at that work-
site, can file a complaint and set off 
the clock of the process so we can actu-
ally challenge when they break the 
law. 
We know why companies close fac-
tories in Ohio and in the State of my 
friend from Rhode Island, in Cranston, 
RI. They close factories and open them 
in Mexico because they can pay lower 
wages, and they can take advantage of 
workers who don’t have rights. Amer-
ican workers can’t compete with that. 
We know that, and we get a race to the 
bottom on wages. 
What this agreement does is that it 
puts workers at the center. It allows 
for real labor enforcement, real en-
forcement of labor standards. So I 
voted for this agreement. It passed 
with only three ‘‘no’’ votes in the Sen-
ate committee. It will likely pass on 
the floor either this week or next week. 
But I want to be straight with Amer-
ican workers. This isn’t a perfect 
agreement. It is one trade deal that 
Democrats fixed. Democrats and labor 
fixed it. Republicans opposed the fix 
but are now voting for it because they 
still want USMCA, but it will not fix 
the rest of President Trump’s economic 
policies that put corporations over 
workers. 
Let me give you an example. If you 
are a company in Dayton, OH, you pay 
a 21-percent corporate tax rate. If you 
move to Mexico or you move to France 
or you move to China, you pay only a 
10.5-percent corporate tax rate. So our 
government continues this because of 
President Trump’s tax bill, the tax bill 
that caused us now to have a trillion- 
dollar-a-year deficit—the largest def-
icit we have had, except in times of re-
cession. That tax bill still will make it 
attractive for companies to shut down 
and move overseas. This helps with 
that. 
As I said, I voted yes for the first 
time on a trade agreement because by 
including 
Brown-Wyden, 
Democrats 
have made this agreement, for the first 
time, pro-worker. We set an important 
precedent that, from now on, every 
trade agreement we negotiate—and, I 
believe, negotiated by Presidents in ei-
ther party—will include language like 
Brown-Wyden, making sure that work-
ers are at the table and that trade 
agreements look out for workers, un-
like trade agreements in the past. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 20 minutes in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
the publication Grist did an article re-
cently about climate change with a 
bunch of images. I grabbed a few of 
those images, and I have added a few in 
this speech because they give a pretty 
good overview of the mess that we are 
in on climate change. 
Right now, the most devastating 
wildfires anyone can remember are rip-
ping across Australia. Here, you see an 
iconic kangaroo going by a building up 
in flames. Those Australian fires have 
destroyed thousands of homes. They 
have killed an estimated 1 billion ani-
mals—get your head around 1 billion 
animals killed—and they have made a 
day of breathing the air in Sidney, 
Australia, the equivalent of smoking 37 
cigarettes. In fact, I read in the news 
that in a tennis championship in Aus-
tralia today, one of the competitors 
withdrew because the air was so bad 
that she couldn’t finish her match. 
Why is this going on? According to 
the Australia Bureau of Meteorology, 
Australia has warmed by about a full 
degree Celsius over the last century. 
That means a longer, hotter fire sea-
son, which loads the dice in favor of ex-
treme winds and heat and bushfire, as 
they call it in Australia. 
Why did it warm in Australia? The 
cause could not be more clear. This is 
the measurement of carbon dioxide lev-
els in the Earth’s atmosphere, going 
back hundreds of thousands of years— 
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800,000 
years. That is way back. There was no 
agriculture then, no wheel then, and, 
for sure, no Twitter—nothing. 
Over time, we have seen this steady 
range of atmospheric CO2 levels, run-
ning between about 180 and—here is the 
cresting out—just under 300 parts per 
million. So it is 800,000 years, all be-
tween 180 and 300 degrees. That is a 120- 
degree range. 
We are now out of that range by 
more than the entire range itself. We 
are out by more than 120. This chart 
goes up to 400 parts per million. We are 
literally off the chart right now at 410 
parts per million. Of course, this is 
connected to heat. That is not news.

of Grist. So let me take this oppor-
tunity to thank them. 
This next chart shows the increase in 
carbon dioxide just in the last decade. 
This is from 2010 to 2019. If you took 
the previous graph, which is in here 
somewhere, this is just the tiniest lit-
tle slice at the very edge of this—just 
10 years out of 800,000. That is like one 
eighty-thousandths of that graph, that 
tiny little sliver. 
In that tiny little sliver, here is what 
has happened. It has gone from below 
390 parts per million up to 410. We hit 
the magic 400 back in about 2013 for the 
first time right here with this dot. 
That was a big deal. The measurement 
came from NOAA’s Mauna Loa Observ-
atory in Hawaii. Never, ever, ever be-
fore in human history, over those hun-
dreds of thousands of years, had we 
seen 400 parts per million, and in just 
the last decade, it shot up by all this. 
In fact, in the last 7 years, it shot up 
more than 10 parts per million. 
We know something about what hap-
pens as these CO2 levels go up. We 
know that the planet warms. That is 
not news. We have known that since 
Abraham Lincoln was President. When 
Abraham Lincoln was riding around 
Washington in his top hat, scientists 
had already begun to write about and 
understand the link between green-
house gases like carbon dioxide and 
global warming. Heck, even Exxon sci-
entists knew about this decades ago, 
and their scientists warned the com-
pany about this in reports that we now 
have. 
Of 
course, 
Exxon 
did 
the 
wickedest possible thing with that in-
formation, which was to bury it, deny 
it, and try to convince the public that 
the opposite was true. 
There is nothing new in any of this 
information. The science is totally es-
tablished, and that level is unprece-
dented in humankind’s history. As a 
result—guess what—things have start-
ed to go haywire. This chart shows the 
cost of annual billion-dollar disasters 
in the United States, the disasters that 
cost us $1 billion each. There is a very 
clear trendline that draws through 
this, and it is climbing upward. If you 
don’t believe me, ask an insurance 
company, ask a reinsurance company. 
Now, bear in mind that these costs, 
the cost of natural disasters, are just 
one of the big economic threats from 
climate change. We have warnings 
about coastal property values crashing. 
Those come from Freddie Mac, of all 
places. We have warnings about the 
carbon bubble crashing. Those come 
from the Bank of England and many 
other sovereign banks. We have warn-
ings about insurance markets and 
about the bond safety of coastal com-
munities. 
In fact, those numbers—the numbers 
of the cost of natural disasters—are ac-
tually pretty tiny so far compared to 
what is projected. What is projected is 
an estimated tens of trillions of dollars 
by 2100. 
One way this plays out is in my home 
State. This is northern Narragansett 
Bay. Here is Providence, our capital 
city. Here is Warwick. Over here is 
Bristol. Everything that is blue on this 
map is land today. On these blue parts 
people have homes; people have busi-
nesses; the State has infrastructure; 
there is economic activity; and, my 
God, there are memories. Well, the 
blue disappears. The blue disappears. 
The blue disappears at 10 feet of sea 
level rise. That is what this measures. 
This 
comes 
off 
a 
program 
called 
STORMTOOLS run by the Coastal Re-
sources 
Management 
Council, 
our 
Rhode Island CZMA agency. 
Our State officials, based on the lat-
est information from NOAA and from 
our University of Rhode Island and 
from the Coastal Resources Manage-
ment Council, are preparing for sce-
narios up to 9 feet of sea level rise in 
Rhode Island by the end of the cen-
tury—not storm surge, just bathtub- 
level sea level rise. Add in storm surge, 
and you not only get over 9 feet; you 
get over the 10 feet that is displayed 
here in this graph. The damage to my 
State is going to be very serious. The 
very map of Rhode Island will change 
because of this. Now, some of my col-
leagues think this is all funny, that 
this is something we can just yuck it 
up about and mock the science and call 
people alarmists when they take this 
seriously. 
It is deadly serious. In fact, a 2017 re-
port from the real estate database com-
pany Zillow identified over 4,800 homes 
in Rhode Island with a collective value 
at over $3 billion that would be under-
water by 2100 using only a 6-foot bath-
tub sea level rise figure—$3 billion just 
in my small State. That doesn’t count 
the value of the memories. If you have 
a house near the shore, you very likely 
have family memories. Some of these 
places in Rhode Island go back genera-
tions—even small, small houses. People 
have had them. Their grandfather had 
them. They have memories. All of that 
is at risk to be lost. So don’t think I 
am not going to fight about this just 
because somebody else thinks this is 
funny. 
The reason that is happening is the 
oceans are warming. When you warm 
water, it expands, so it rises—in addi-
tion, of course, to all the trillions of 
gallons pouring off of Greenland and 
other land-based icecaps. Look at how 
the ocean has warmed. The red is the 3- 
month average. It has more variation 
in it. The black is the annual average. 
The blue is the 5-year average that 
smooths it out a little bit more. 
The 
ocean 
is 
absorbing 
intense 
amounts of heat. I will tell you how 
much heat the ocean is absorbing. If 
you took the Hiroshima atom bomb 
and you captured all of its energy as 
heat—it produced light; it produced a 
variety of other things—the rate at 
which the ocean is warming is the 
equivalent—I usually use—of between 
three and four Hiroshima-sized nuclear 
detonations per second in the ocean— 
per second. So, in the time of this 
speech, there will be dozens, probably 
100, 
Hiroshima-sized 
nuclear 
explo-
sions’ worth of heat that the oceans 
have to absorb. 
Today a new report came out that 
says that the number is actually five 
Hiroshima-sized explosions per second. 
As they measure it better, as they see 
it increase more, we are seeing that 
number. It is not just that they are 
warming. That would be bad enough. 
They are becoming more acid. They are 
becoming more acid because they ab-
sorb carbon dioxide at the surface. This 
is a chemical interface. This took away 
90 percent of the extra heat that our 
fossil fuel emissions have caused, the 
absorption of the heat by the oceans. 
At the same time, while it was absorb-
ing 90 percent of the heat, it was also 
absorbing 30 percent of the carbon di-
oxide. 
Imagine for a second if we were not 
an ocean planet. Imagine if we were a 
fully terrestrial planet and we didn’t 
have the oceans to buffer this. You 
would have to add back that extra 
third of CO2, which would be a 50-per-
cent increase on the lower base, and 
you would have to multiply by 10 the 
increase from heat. You put those two 
factors together—this is a very rough 
number, and the scientists on my staff 
would be mad at me for saying this, 
but maybe 15 times the result that we 
are seeing right now. We are experi-
encing a fraction of what we would face 
without the cooling and buffering 
oceans. Without our oceans, Australia 
wouldn’t just be one location on fire; 
the whole planet would be a catas-
trophe. 
Those are the chances that we are 
taking. Why are we taking these 
chances? We are taking these chances 
because politicians don’t dare say no to 
the crooked fossil fuel industry that 
profits from this mess. That is just the 
sickening political fact that we have to 
deal with here. 
That is steadily moving because the 
public is beginning to understand this. 
Notwithstanding a long and very, very 
expensive 
campaign 
of 
misleading 
propaganda by the fossil fuel industry, 
people are starting to catch on. These 
are the numbers—from 60 up to 72 per-
cent—of people who believe that warm-
ing is happening. The number of people 
who are denying went from 20 percent 
down to 12 percent. Understanding is 
up. Denial is down. Ditto for that it is 
caused by us: 46 up to 59 percent, and 35 
down to 30 percent denying. Under-
standing is up. Denial is down. 
So the other thing that is good that 
is happening behind these numbers is 
that Americans of a whole variety of 
persuasions actually favor the solu-
tions that scientists and economists 
recommend 
to 
solve 
the 
climate 
change problem. Now, the fossil fuel in-
dustry, in its portfolio of lies, tells you 
that the remedies to solve climate 
change will be painful. That is just an-
other fossil fuel lie, and Americans are 
catching on to that one too. An Octo-
ber 2019 Pew poll found that two-thirds

of Americans want the Federal Govern-
ment to do more to combat climate 
change. 
One thing that we are getting rid of 
in a hurry is coal. This represents the 
cumulative retirements of coal plants. 
Coal plants are phasing out, with 546 
coal plants having closed in the United 
States since 2010, just in this last dec-
ade. In late 2019, Murray Energy be-
came the eighth U.S. coal company in 
a year to file for bankruptcy. Coal 
plants 
anywhere 
are 
virtually 
unfinanceable. We have even seen oper-
ating, depreciated coal plants close be-
cause just operating that coal plant 
costs more than financing, building, 
and operating renewable energy facili-
ties. That is good news for our safety 
and for our well-being. 
Here is our overall energy portfolio 
and where it has increased. Look at 
solar go. Ho, ho. Oh, my gosh. It is up 
about 1,000 percent. It is really, really 
rocking. The second biggest increase: 
wind. More are coming on as we begin 
to develop offshore wind. 
Fossil fuels still dominate. You can 
see this little inlay here—the transpor-
tation sector—but Americans are start-
ing to buy more and more electric vehi-
cles. Some really stunning new models 
are coming to the market. We are, of 
course, 
not 
doing 
anywhere 
near 
enough to encourage their adoption, 
which means we are likely to lose out, 
and we are doing this because rogue 
fossil fuel companies like Marathon 
Petroleum use political mischief to 
poke sticks in the wheels of vehicle 
fuel efficiency standards. 
What the fossil fuel industry likes to 
do is to blame China: Oh, we are not 
going to do anything because China has 
to go first. What they omit telling you 
is that, at the end of 2017, 40 percent of 
all the electric cars in the world were 
in China. In 2018, China manufactured 
nearly half of all electric vehicles 
worldwide. 
China 
dominates 
global 
markets for electric buses and for elec-
tric 
two-wheelers—scooters 
and 
so 
forth. 
You may recall that Exxon Corpora-
tion fabulously predicted to its share-
holders—a prediction they have not yet 
corrected—that there would be zero 
electric buses by 2040. China is already 
operating 400,000. We are going to get 
run away from by China if we don’t 
smarten up and compete. 
Here is more good news. The price of 
digging out and transporting and burn-
ing dirty fuels is high: nearly $110 for a 
megawatt hour of coal-fueled power. If 
you look, the most expensive are nu-
clear power plants; the next most ex-
pensive, coal; the next most expensive, 
solar thermal, which generates heat; 
the next most expensive, natural gas; 
and down here, the two cheapest by far 
are solar photovoltaic and wind. 
So we know where these markets are 
going, with just $40 per megawatt hour 
for solar photovoltaic compared to $110 
for coal. Over the last decade, the aver-
age cost of solar dropped from $200 per 
megawatt hour to less than a quarter 
of that. The cost of wind power is 
down, and offshore wind is emerging. 
Battery storage now competes on price 
with gas-fired, peak-demand plants in 
many areas. Even with the massive 
subsidy that we all have to pay to prop 
up fossil fuel, renewables are starting 
to win on price anyway. 
If the price of wind, solar, battery 
storage, and other renewable tech-
nologies continues to drop, we could 
reach 100 percent renewable energy by 
the middle of the century, and we will 
need to if we are going to stay within 
the 1.5 degrees Celsius safe zone. In 
fact, here is what you see. The power 
sector’s emissions are declining. 
There is a lot of work left to do in 
transportation—what you might call 
room for improvement there. There is a 
lot of room for improvement in indus-
try and a lot of room for improvement 
in buildings and other. So there is 
work to be done here. 
Of course, these other sectors don’t 
have much of an incentive to solve 
their emissions problem because it is 
still free to pollute. We continue to 
violate the most basic market theory 
about externalities, and we let these 
fossil fuel polluters pollute for free. 
When we let them pollute for free, it 
takes away any incentive in these 
other sectors to fix that problem—and, 
of course, that is goal 1 for the fossil- 
fuel industry. With a $650 billion-per- 
year subsidy, they are throwing every-
thing they have politically at trying to 
protect that phony, non-market-based, 
unfair subsidy. And even with it, they 
are still losing. 
We could be doing better in all these 
sectors if we put a proper market-based 
price on carbon. So far they have won, 
if you can call not preparing for a 
looming calamity to be winning. 
Here is a quick summary of the les-
sons of the 2010s. 
One, the science is clear—we have 
blown by 400 parts per million. We are 
now in unchartered territory for the 
human species. 
Two, climate change is a massive 
threat to our economy, particularly 
with the danger of crashes coming soon 
in coastal property values and carbon 
assets. 
I just read the letter from BlackRock 
to CEOs and investors. BlackRock is 
one of the biggest investment compa-
nies in the world. They have warned of 
what they called capital reallocation. 
That means things are going to shift— 
happening as markets anticipate cli-
mate hazard—things like facing the 
danger of coastal property value crash-
es or carbon asset value crashes. Those 
crashes create capital reallocation. 
I love the way economists talk. All 
the agony behind that, and they call it 
capital 
reallocation. 
Wrecking 
the 
world economy, they call systemic 
risk. 
Three, Americans are getting that 
climate change is a big problem. It is a 
big change. It is a big change particu-
larly with young Republicans, who to-
tally get it. 
Here is my challenge to my Repub-
lican colleagues in the Senate: Sit 
down with your own young staffers. Sit 
down with the young staffers in your 
own office and hear them out about cli-
mate change. You will see that there is 
a big generational divide. 
Four, coal is on the ropes. Experts 
predict huge stranded assets in gas and 
oil. Solar and other renewables are 
booming as they outcompete fossil fuel 
on costs alone. That is a genie even the 
crooked fossil fuel machine can’t put 
back in the bottle. 
Of course, the fossil fuel industry is 
still up to no good, with its vast array 
of phony front groups so it does not 
look like it is them. They have names 
like the George C. Marshall Institute, 
the Competitive Enterprise Institute, 
the Heartland Institute—a bunch of 
phony front groups filled with stables 
of paid liars emitting slimy rivers of 
dark money, polluting our politics as 
badly as their emissions pollute our 
planet. That hasn’t stopped, and they 
should be held accountable. 
The 2020s are going to be tough, for 
sure. Australia is seeing the opening 
episode. 
I have an analogy that I will use as I 
close. I have spent time running rivers. 
I like running rivers. I like running 
rivers in inflatables. I like running riv-
ers in kayaks. I have run rivers from 
the placid Rappahannock in Virginia to 
the mighty Colorado through our mas-
sive Grand Canyon and lots in between. 
One of the things about running a river 
that has big rapids is that the first 
thing you do is you look at the map 
and you learn where the big rapids are 
so you can stop, get safely to shore, 
and figure out whether you can navi-
gate the rapids or whether you need to 
portage around them. 
Well, we had a map for where the rap-
ids are on this. The scientists showed 
us. They told us. They warned us. But 
we ignored them. But not paying atten-
tion to what you are told on the 
science map is not your last chance. 
Going down the river, when you get 
closer, you can actually start to hear 
the falls, the rapids roaring up ahead of 
you. 
The wildfires, the flooding, the rising 
seas, the species relocating around the 
planet—if that is not a roaring for us 
to hear now from the planet about the 
dangers ahead, shame on us. It is 
enough for us to know that we are ac-
tually getting close to big trouble, and 
we still do nothing. 
Then there is a point on the river 
where it is your last chance. You have 
no choice as to whether you are going 
to miss the rapids or the falls ahead. 
You have ignored all the warnings. You 
have ignored the map. You haven’t lis-
tened to the roar, and now you are 
close. Now you will have to paddle very 
hard to avoid the roaring rapids ahead. 
Nature’s forces are pulling you inex-
orably toward the cataract. You will 
have to paddle for your life to avoid it. 
That is where I believe we are right 
now. I believe that as human kind, as a

country, we have to paddle for our lives 
right now to avoid being sucked over 
the climate falls and into dangers that 
we don’t want to see and that we don’t 
want our children to have to see. 
Let’s wake up here. Let’s shake off 
the shackles of this crooked fossil fuel 
industry, and let’s get paddling for our 
lives.

I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

I ask unanimous consent that the order

TRIBUTE TO DR. SAMIR GUINDI 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the community in Harlan County, KY, 
will gather next month in honor of a 
devoted caregiver and friend as he pre-
pares to begin a well-deserved retire-
ment. Today, I would like to join them 
in paying tribute to Dr. Samir Guindi 
for the 45 years of devotion he has 
given to Southeastern Kentucky. 
Dr. Guindi—Sam to his friends—and 
his wife, Laila, are originally from 
Egypt. They arrived in Harlan in 1975, 
where Sam spent much of his career as 
the only ear, nose, and throat surgical 
specialist in the area. As a result, his 
services were constantly in demand, 
and 
he 
dedicated 
himself 
whole-
heartedly to the vital work. Conserv-
ative estimates by his colleagues show 
Sam conducted more than 200,000 pa-
tient visits during his impressive ca-
reer. 
He 
performed 
approximately 
30,000 procedures. Many of the patients 
Sam treated were children at high risk 
of ear damage and deafness. 
On top of his busy professional sched-
ule, Sam partnered with the well-re-
garded 
Appalachian 
Regional 
Healthcare System to provide chari-
table care for families in need. He was 
based in Harlan, but Sam’s work ex-
tended into nearby Bell, Letcher, and 
Perry Counties as well. He spent count-
less hours on the road to see scores of 
patients in a single day, often without 
any compensation. In a region that has 
long faced a scarcity of medical profes-
sionals, Sam’s tireless generosity and 
kindness made a remarkable impact on 
families in Southeastern Kentucky. 
Sam’s life has been a wonderful ex-
ample of selflessness. Both of his sons, 
Alfi and Sherif, are successful attor-
neys, and Sherif followed his father 
into the service of his community by 
working as a public defender and an as-
sistant Commonwealth’s attorney. It is 
my privilege to join the Guindi family, 
the Harlan community, and all of 
Sam’s patients in thanking him for his 
decades of providing vital medical care 
in Appalachia. I wish Sam the very 
best as he enjoys a relaxing retirement. 
I urge my Senate colleagues to join me 
in commending this outstanding Ken-
tuckian. 
TRIBUTE TO TOMMY LOVING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
it is a pleasure to join the residents of 
Warren County, as well as law enforce-
ment professionals throughout Ken-
tucky, in congratulating my friend 
Tommy Loving as he marks 50 years of 
distinguished service in law enforce-
ment next month. With a dedication to 
service, Tommy has been instrumental 
in the protection of Kentucky’s fami-
lies and communities. He continues to 
answer the call of duty each and every 
day, and our Commonwealth is safer as 
a result. 
Tommy’s career in law enforcement 
began at age 21 when he joined the 
Kentucky State Police, KSP, as a dis-
patcher. He would wear the gray uni-
form for more than two decades, serv-
ing as a trooper and then sergeant at 
posts across the Commonwealth. 
In response to the ongoing struggle 
against illegal drugs, local leaders es-
tablished the Bowling Green-Warren 
County Drug Task Force in 1997. They 
asked Tommy to put his experience to 
work protecting families from the 
spike of substance abuse as the organi-
zation’s inaugural director. For the 
last 23 years, Tommy has done just 
that. 
The task force is a collaborative 
team from the local police department, 
the county sheriff, Western Kentucky 
University’s police force, the KSP, pro-
fessionals from the Kentucky Gov-
ernor’s and Attorney General’s Offices, 
and Federal law enforcement. These of-
ficers, bolstered by chemists, prosecu-
tors, and support staff, lead the fight 
against the spread of dangerous sub-
stances in Warren County. As Ken-
tucky continues to endure the dev-
astating consequences of the opioid 
epidemic and a resurgence of meth-
amphetamine use, the task force’s ex-
pertise is vital now more than ever. 
Because of his decade-long record 
leading this highly specialized team, 
Tommy was asked to take on an addi-
tional responsibility as the executive 
director of the Kentucky Narcotic Offi-
cers’ Association, KNOA. With a mis-
sion to assist law enforcement per-
sonnel 
throughout 
the 
State 
with 
training and support as they combat il-
licit drug abuse, KNOA has increased 
the wellbeing of communities through-
out the Commonwealth. 
In recognition of his success in both 
local 
and 
State 
law 
enforcement, 
Tommy was selected to be the regional 
director for the National Narcotics Of-
ficers’ Association Coalition in 2010. 
Now, he coordinates with officers and 
policymakers across six States and our 
Nation’s Capital to share best practices 
and 
enhance 
public 
safety. 
Other 
States are looking to Kentucky for 
leadership, and Tommy’s experience is 
benefiting families and communities 
around the country. 
Thankfully, last year Kentucky saw 
the largest decrease in drug overdose 
fatalities in a decade. It was a long- 
awaited glimmer of hope in our fight 
against addiction. The service of law 
enforcement officers, like Tommy, is a 
critical part of our comprehensive re-
sponse to the addiction epidemic, and I 
hope he and his colleagues are proud of 
their contributions to this good news. 
In 2018, the KNOA Board unanimously 
voted to bestow on Tommy their Life-
time Distinguished Service Award for 
his decades of work protecting families 
and 
communities 
from 
substance 
abuse. 
It is a distinct pleasure for me to join 
the chorus praising Tommy for his 
half-century in law enforcement. We 
may never be able to repay the selfless 
sacrifices of the brave men and women 
who protect our communities, but we 
can and should show our gratitude. 
Tommy’s leadership and service are a 
great asset to Kentucky, and I know I 
speak for many when I say thank you. 
As he celebrates this milestone, I hope 
my Senate colleagues join me in shar-
ing our congratulations with Tommy 
Loving and thanking him for his faith-
ful service to Kentucky families.

REMEMBERING CHRISTOPHER 
ALLEN 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak about a dedicated 
husband, father, son, public servant, 
and Marylander, Chris Allen. 
Sadly, Chris passed away last week. 
He was 58 years old. He leaves behind a 
wife Lynda-Marie, and two daughters, 
Sophie and Lucie. 
Chris spent years in the office of my 
friend Senator ROBERTS, relentlessly 
advocating on behalf of his constitu-
ents. More recently, he worked for Sen-
ator GRASSLEY on the Republican staff 
of the Senate Finance Committee, 
where he pushed for pragmatic policy 
solutions to improve the life of retirees 
and the pension system. 
Those of us who were lucky enough 
to know Chris know he lifted the spir-
its of those around him through his 
wry sense of humor and infectious posi-
tivity. At work, he was experienced, 
passionate, and knowledgeable about 
his work, always searching for good 
policy with bipartisan support. 
For those lucky enough to work with 
Chris, he made lifelong friends and al-
lies. He will not soon be forgotten. 
The world is a little less upbeat with-
out Chris here. I hope you will join me 
in praying for his family and friends.

and to the United States of America. 
Over the past year, she has served as 
the congressional analyst and congres-
sional liaison in the Office of the Army 
Surgeon General. 
LTC Sarah Eccleston was born and 
raised in Dillon, MT, and began her 
Army service in 2001 as a cadet in the

January 14, 2020 
In 2004, she was commissioned as a dis-
tinguished military graduate from the 
University of Utah ROTC Program and 
received her bachelors of science de-
gree in nursing from Westminster Col-
lege, Salt Lake City, UT. 
On her initial assignment as a lieu-
tenant, she served as a staff nurse on a 
32-bed multidisciplinary medical-sur-
gical unit at the Carl R. Darnall Army 
Medical Center at Fort Hood, TX. She 
then attended the Critical Care Nurse 
Course at Brooke Army Medical Cen-
ter, BAMC, in Fort Sam Houston, TX, 
where she began working as a clinical 
staff nurse in the surgical trauma in-
tensive care unit at BAMC. 
In 2009, she deployed with the 10th 
Combat Support Hospital out of Fort 
Carson, CO, to Baghdad, Iraq, where 
she worked as a critical care nurse. 
Shortly thereafter, she began working 
as the 2nd Brigade ROTC nurse coun-
selor at Fort Dix, NJ. She completed 
her time with ROTC in May of 2012 and 
was selected for long-term health edu-
cation and training through Widener 
University, where she received a mas-
ter’s in nursing. After graduating as a 
critical care clinical nurse specialist, 
Lieutenant Colonel Eccleston was as-
signed to Madigan Army Medical Cen-
ter in Fort Lewis, WA, where she 
oversaw policy and quality of practice 
in three intensive care units. 
Prior to her current assignment, in 
the summer of 2018, Lieutenant Colonel 
Eccleston was selected to serve as the 
executive nurse fellow to the Chief and 
Deputy Chief of the Army Nurse Corps. 
After graduating as a critical care 
clinical nurse specialist, Lieutenant 
Colonel Eccleston was assigned to Mad-
igan Army Medical Center at Joint 
Base Fort Lewis-McChord, WA, where 
she oversaw policy and quality of prac-
tice in three intensive care units. 
Montanans and all Americans owe 
LTC Sarah Eccleston the deepest grati-
tude for her decade of active service to 
this Nation. I wish Sarah and her fam-
ily all the best as they continue their 
journey of service.

TRIBUTE TO NORMA KAEHLER 
∑
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
am pleased to recognize Mrs. Norma 
Kaehler on the occasion of her retire-
ment. Norma has been a hero of the 
aviation community for more than two 
decades. Most recently, she served as 
the managing director for government 
and corporate affairs at American Air-
lines Group. 
Not many may remember this, but 
Norma got her start on Capitol Hill 
working for Senator Mack Mattingly of 
Georgia, and she never forgot that tak-
ing care of constituents is our No. 1 
priority around here. She has always 
worked on behalf of the employees of 
American Airlines on Capitol Hill, tens 
of thousands of airline pilots, mechan-
ics and maintenance personnel, flight 
attendants, gate agents, and everyone 
in the back office—all responsible for 
ensuring planes depart and land on 
time—have benefited from her advo-
cacy on their behalf. I can personally 
attest to this during her tireless advo-
cacy of legislation I sponsored that 
protected the retirement benefits of 
American Airline employees after the 
2013 merger. 
In the course of her career, Norma 
Kaehler has worked for multiple air-
lines: Trans World Airlines, American 
Airlines, and American Airlines Group; 
and she played a major role in every 
FAA reauthorization bill enacted by 
Congress. Through it all, Norma re-
mained an unflappable, passionate ad-
vocate for aviation. I know I join her 
family 
and 
American 
Airlines 
in 
thanking Norma for her years of serv-
ice and contributions to the aviation 
community. 
Congratulations on your retirement. 
We will miss you around here.∑

TRIBUTE TO JULIUS P. KNAPP 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
rise today to commend Julius ‘‘Julie’’ 
P. Knapp for his service to our Nation 
during the past 45 years. Mr. Knapp re-
tires this month from his position as 
the FCC’s Chief of the Office of Engi-
neering and Technology, OET, where 
he helped usher in the modern age of 
communications and was instrumental 
in making spectrum available to fuel 
our Nation’s economic growth in this 
area. If you are accessing a mobile de-
vice right now, using Wi-Fi, or buying 
the latest wireless gadget, you are like-
ly benefiting from Julie Knapp’s work. 
Mr. Knapp is well known and re-
spected here in Congress for his tech-
nically precise and straightforward tes-
timony at countless hearings. Mr. 
Knapp is a world-recognized expert in 
communications and is widely viewed 
as a leader on technical policy issues 
because of his expertise, his pragmatic 
and fair approach, and his ability to 
‘‘translate’’ complex engineering issues 
to policymakers on all sides of an 
issue. He has briefed generations of 
congressional staffers on the intrica-
cies of spectrum management and pro-
vided significant and substantial input 
on spectrum legislation. Many Mem-
bers of this body have discussed com-
munications 
industry 
developments 
with Julie, including low power FM, 
wireless and satellite issues, 4G LTE, 
Wi-Fi, and 5G, among others. 
When the public looks at Julie 
Knapp’s career, we can see a parallel to 
the timeline of America’s communica-
tions industry’s growth. He graduated 
from high school in New Hyde, NY, in 
1969, and he received his engineering 
degree from the City College of New 
York in 1974. Less than a month later, 
he went right to work for the American 
people. He rose through the ranks at 
the FCC, beginning as a 22-year-old cer-
tifying radio frequency devices and 
growing into a seasoned professional in 
the increasingly important equipment

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING PAUL ‘‘PETE’’ DYE, 
JR. 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today 
I honor the life of Paul ‘‘Pete’’ Dye, 
Jr., who was a legend in the sport of 
golf and the most iconic golf course ar-
chitect in the modern era. Just one of 
five architects to be inducted into the 
World Golf Hall of Fame, his death on 
January 9, 2020, marks an end to an il-
lustrious career of dedication and con-
tribution to the sport. 
Born on December 29, 1925, in Urbana, 
OH, Dye was first introduced to golf by 
his father, who built Urbana Country 
Club, a nine-hole course on their fam-
ily’s land in Champaign County. As a 
high schooler, Dye won the State 
championship and went on to medal in 
the State amateur golf championship. 
While many know Dye as an iconic 
course designer, he was also deeply 
committed to our great Nation. In 1944 
at the age of 18, Dye enlisted in the 
U.S. Army during World War II. 
Dye leaves behind an extraordinary 
legacy, including the world-renowned 
‘‘Island Green,’’ the 17th hole at TPC 
Sawgrass in my home State of Florida, 
where Dye lived for many years. Flor-
ida was a special place for Dye, and it 
was also where he met his wife, Alice 
Holliday O’Neal, while he was enrolled 
at Rollins College. They went on to 
have two sons, P.B. and Perry, who to 
this day have continued their father’s 
work, 
honoring 
him 
by 
designing 
courses under the Dye Designs banner. 
With immense gratitude for his work 
and service, I am honored to pay trib-
ute to Pete’s life.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S195 
January 14, 2020 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3190 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Domestic 
Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Recent reports have demonstrated that 
White supremacists and other far-right-wing 
extremists are the most significant domestic 
terrorism threat facing the United States, 
including— 
(A) a February 22, 2019, New York Times 
op-ed, by a Trump Administration United 
States Department of Justice official, who 
wrote that ‘‘white supremacy and far-right 
extremism are among the greatest domestic- 
security threats facing the United States. 
Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law en-
forcement, at both the Federal and State 
levels, has been slow to respond. . . .Killings 
committed by individuals and groups associ-
ated with far-right extremist groups have 
risen significantly.’’; 
(B) an April 2017 Government Account-
ability Office report on the significant, le-
thal threat posed by domestic violent ex-
tremists, which— 
(i) explained that ‘‘[s]ince September 12, 
2001, the number of fatalities caused by do-
mestic violent extremists has ranged from 1 
to 49 in a given year.’’; and 
(ii) noted that ‘‘[F]atalities resulting from 
attacks by far right wing violent extremists 
have exceeded those caused by radical 
Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 
years, and were the same in 3 of the years 
since September 12, 2001. Of the 85 violent ex-
tremist incidents that resulted in death 
since September 12, 2001, far right wing vio-
lent extremist groups were responsible for 62 
(73 percent) while radical Islamist violent ex-
tremists were responsible for 23 (27 per-
cent).’’; and 
(C) an unclassified May 2017 joint intel-
ligence bulletin from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the Department of Home-
land Security, which found that ‘‘white su-
premacist extremism poses [a] persistent 
threat of lethal violence,’’ and that White 
supremacists ‘‘were responsible for 49 homi-
cides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more 
than any other domestic extremist move-
ment’’. 
(2) Recent domestic terrorist attacks in-
clude— 
(A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a 
Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in 
which a White supremacist shot and killed 6 
members of the gurdwara; 
(B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a 
Jewish community center and a Jewish as-
sisted living facility in Overland Park, Kan-
sas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3 ci-
vilians, including a 14-year-old teenager; 
(C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, 
Nevada, in which 2 supporters of the far- 
right-wing ‘‘patriot’’ movement shot and 
killed 2 police officers and a civilian; 
(D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the 
Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South 
Carolina, in which a White supremacist shot 
and killed 9 members of the church; 
(E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at 
a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado 
Springs, Colorado, in which an anti-abortion 
extremist shot and killed a police officer and 
2 civilians; 
(F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an Afri-
can-American man in New York City, alleg-
edly committed by a White supremacist who 
reportedly traveled to New York ‘‘for the 
purpose of killing black men’’; 
(G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, 
Oregon, in which a White supremacist alleg-
edly murdered 2 men and injured a third 
after the men defended 2 young women whom 
the individual had targeted with anti-Mus-
lim hate speech; 
(H) the August 12, 2017, attacks in Char-
lottesville, Virginia, in which— 
(i) a White supremacist killed one and in-
jured nineteen after driving his car through 
a crowd of individuals protesting a neo-Nazi 
rally, and of which former Attorney General 
Jeff Sessions said, ‘‘It does meet the defini-
tion of domestic terrorism in our statute.’’; 
and 
(ii) a group of 6 men linked to militia or 
White supremacist groups assaulted an Afri-
can-American man who had been protesting 
the neo-Nazi rally in a downtown parking ga-
rage; 
(I) the July 2018 murder of an African- 
American woman from Kansas City, Mis-
souri, allegedly committed by a White su-
premacist who reportedly bragged about 
being a member of the Ku Klux Klan; 
(J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in 
Jeffersontown, Kentucky, in which a White 
man allegedly murdered 2 African Americans 
at a grocery store after first attempting to 
enter a church with a predominantly Afri-
can-American congregation during a service; 
(K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting at 
the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, in which a White nationalist 
allegedly shot and killed 11 members of the 
congregation; 
(L) the April 27, 2019, shooting at the 
Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, in 
which a man yelling anti-Semitic slurs alleg-
edly killed a member of the congregation 
and wounded 3 others; 
(M) the August 3, 2019, mass shooting at a 
Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in which a White 
supremacist 
with 
anti-immigrant 
views 
killed 22 people and injured 26 others; 
(N) the December 10, 2019, shooting at a Ko-
sher supermarket in Jersey City, New Jer-
sey, in which 2 men with anti-Semitic views 
killed 3 people in the store and a law enforce-
ment officer in an earlier encounter; and 
(O) the December 28, 2019, machete attack 
at a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, New 
York, in which a man who had expressed 
anti-Semitic views stabbed 5 individuals. 
(3) In November 2019, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation released its annual hate crime 
incident report, which found that in 2018, 
violent hate crimes reached a 16-year high. 
Though the overall number of hate crimes 
decreased slightly after three consecutive 
years of increases, the report found a 4-per-
cent increase in aggravated assaults, a 15- 
percent increase in simple assaults, and a 13- 
percent increase in intimidation. There was 
also a nearly 6-percent increase in hate 
crimes directed at LGBTQ individuals and a 
14-percent increase in hate crimes directed 
at Hispanic and Latino individuals. Nearly 60 
percent of the religion-based hate crimes re-
ported targeted American Jews and Jewish 
institutions. The previous year’s report 
found that in 2017, hate crimes increased by 
approximately 17 percent, including a 23-per-
cent increase in religion-based hate crimes, 
an 18-percent increase in race-based crimes, 
and a 5-percent increase in crimes directed 
against LGBTQ individuals. The report ana-
lyzing 2016 data found that hate crimes in-
creased by almost 5 percent that year, in-
cluding a 19-percent rise in hate crimes 
against American Muslims. Similarly, the 
report analyzing 2015 data found that hate 
crimes increased by 6 percent that year. 
Much of the 2015 increase came from a 66-per-
cent rise in attacks on American Muslims 
and a 9-percent rise in attacks on American 
Jews. In all 4 reports, race-based crimes were 
most numerous, and those crimes most often 
targeted African Americans. 
(4) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist 
was arrested and charged with murder after 
allegedly killing 50 Muslim worshippers and 
injuring more than 40 in a massacre at the 
Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque in 
Christchurch, New Zealand. The alleged 
shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic 
manifesto that detailed his White nation-
alist ideology before the massacre. Prime 
Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the mas-
sacre a terrorist attack. 
(5) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist 
who had expressed anti-Muslim views was 
charged with murder for allegedly killing 6 
people and injuring 19 in a shooting rampage 
at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was 
the first-ever mass shooting at a mosque in 
North America, and Prime Minister Trudeau 
labeled it a terrorist attack. 
(6) On February 15, 2019, Federal authori-
ties arrested U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant 
Christopher Paul Hasson, who was allegedly 
planning to kill a number of prominent jour-
nalists, professors, judges, and ‘‘leftists in 
general’’. In court filings, prosecutors de-
scribed Lieutenant Hasson as a ‘‘domestic 
terrorist’’ who in an email ‘‘identified him-
self as a White Nationalist for over 30 years 
and advocated for ‘focused violence’ in order 
to establish a white homeland.’’.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
469—SUP-
PORTING THE PEOPLE OF IRAN 
AS 
THEY 
ENGAGE 
IN 
LEGITI-
MATE 
PROTESTS, 
AND 
CON-
DEMNING THE IRANIAN REGIME 
FOR ITS MURDEROUS RESPONSE 
Mr. 
GRAHAM 
(for 
himself, 
Ms. 
MCSALLY, Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. RUBIO, 
Ms. ERNST, Mr. CRUZ, and Mr. ROMNEY) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 469 
Whereas Iran began experiencing severe 
political unrest following the increase of fuel 
prices in November 2019; 
Whereas reports state that the November 
2019 protests were the deadliest period of po-
litical unrest since the Islamic Revolution 
occurred in 1979, resulting in the deaths of 
hundreds of Iranian citizens; 
Whereas, spurred by the shooting down of a 
Ukrainian airliner by the Iranian military 
and the Government of Iran’s subsequent de-
nial, 
thousands 
of 
Iranian 
protesters, 
undeterred by water cannons, tear gas, and 
the reported use of live ammunition, con-
tinue their legitimate protest against a cor-
rupt regime, hoping that their efforts will re-
sult in a brighter future for all Iranians, not 
just the elite; 
Whereas, on January 10, 2020, during a 
press briefing at the White House concerning 
new tough sanctions on Iran, Secretary 
Pompeo stated, ‘‘These sanctions targets in-
clude the Secretary of the Supreme National 
Council and the Commander of the Basij 
Forces; that’s the regime’s brute squad, 
which has, in the last few months, killed ap-
proximately 1,500 Iranians who were simply 
demanding freedom.’’; 
Whereas, on January 11, 2020, Iran’s only 
Olympic 
medalist, 
Kimia 
Alizadeh, 
an-
nounced her defection from Iran, stating 
that she was ‘‘one of the millions of op-
pressed women in Iran’’ and that she had de-
fected due to ‘‘hypocrisy, lies, injustice, and 
flattery’’ of the Iranian regime; 
Whereas, on January 11, 2020, Secretary 
Pompeo tweeted, ‘‘The voice of the Iranian 
people is clear. They are fed up with the re-
gime’s lies, corruption, ineptitude, and bru-
tality of the IRGC under @khameneilir’s 
kleptocracy. We stand with the Iranian peo-
ple who deserve a better future’’; 
Whereas, on January 12, 2020, in a tweet di-
rected towards Iranian leaders, President 
Trump stated, ‘‘Thousands have already been 
killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is 
watching. More importantly, the USA is 
watching’’; 
Whereas the United States Government 
supports the rights of all people to peaceably 
assemble and allow for substantive dis-
course, and it is deeply troubling that a gov-
ernment would ignore the concerns of its 
citizens as the Government of Iran has con-
tinually done; and 
Whereas, now more than ever, it is impera-
tive that all nations support the people of 
Iran as they protest a government that for 
far too long has ignored the needs of its citi-
zens: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) stands with the people of Iran, hopeful 
for change, as they protest their corrupt and 
oppressive government; 
(2) condemns the lethal crackdown by the 
Iranian regime on the peaceful protestors; 
(3) calls on all peaceful and law abiding na-
tions to support the legitimate protests by 
the Iranian people; and 
(4) demands that the Iranian leadership be 
held accountable for their murderous actions 
against their own citizens who want nothing 
less than to be represented by a fair and just 
government.

War II, in which brave citizens of Poland re-
volted against the German Nazi occupation of 
the city of Warsaw in the face of daunting and 
seemingly insurmountable odds; 
Whereas the Warsaw Uprising, which was 
part of a nationwide resistance against the Ger-
man Nazi occupation of Poland and lasted for 
63 days, was started by the Polish Home Army, 
the underground resistance effort that included 
many young and brave individuals; 
Whereas the Warsaw Uprising occurred just 
over a year after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 
April 1943, which was the single largest act of 
Jewish resistance against forces of Nazi Ger-
many; 
Whereas, after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, 
the remaining Jewish Poles from Warsaw were 
sent to the Treblinka extermination camp, the 
Majdanek labor camp, or other forced-labor 
camps; 
Whereas, beginning August 1, 1944, the Polish 
Home Army fought against the German Nazi oc-
cupation of Warsaw, using mostly homemade 
weapons and far outnumbered by the over-
whelming German Nazi force, at a cost of ap-
proximately 200,000 citizens of Poland killed, 
wounded, or missing; 
Whereas Adolf Hitler ordered the annihilation 
of the city of Warsaw and the extermination of 
its citizens as punishment for the uprising, deci-
mating 80 percent of Warsaw with no regard for 
the lives of the citizens of Warsaw or for the 
rich heritage of historic architecture in Warsaw; 
Whereas a Soviet-led army halted its march 
toward the city of Berlin at the banks of the 
Vistula River on the specific orders of Stalin to 
allow the German Nazis to decimate the Poles; 
Whereas, throughout the Warsaw Uprising, 
many people fled the city of Warsaw, remained 
in hiding, or were wounded or killed, and the 
surviving population of Warsaw, which once to-
taled more than 1,300,000 people, was then sent 
to prisoner of war camps and endured harsh 
conditions; 
Whereas, after World War II, thousands of 
Polish refugees fled from Poland due to persecu-
tion and came to the United States for safety, 
security, and new opportunities; 
Whereas the deep, rich history and traditions 
of immigrants from Poland who settled in the 
United States, particularly in the States of 
Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illi-
nois, and Wisconsin, have undeniably shaped 
the social fabric and foundation of the United 
States; 
Whereas, in the 20th century, Cleveland, 
Ohio; Buffalo, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michi-
gan; and Chicago, Illinois; served as the major 
epicenters for immigrants and workers from Po-
land whose remarkable contributions to indus-
try led to the incorporation of new towns and 
the subsequent growth of those towns; 
Whereas the heroic actions of the Polish un-
derground resistance during World War II and 
the brave citizenry of Poland provide a valuable 
lesson in perseverance and patriotism; 
Whereas the legacy of the Warsaw Uprising 
serves as one of the most poignant reminders of 
the human cost of the Allied war effort during 
World War II to defeat Adolf Hitler and the Ger-
man Nazis; and 
Whereas the bravery demonstrated by the citi-
zens of Poland during the Warsaw Uprising 
continues to inspire people throughout the 
world who are subjected to tyranny and oppres-
sion and who join the fight for freedom, democ-
racy, and the pursuit of liberty: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the 
Warsaw Uprising; 
(2) commends the bravery, heroism, and 
patriotism of the individuals who fought as 
part of the Polish Home Army in order to 
liberate Poland from German Nazi occupa-
tion; and 
(3) honors the memory of the soldiers and 
civilians whose lives were lost during the 
fighting, and the individuals who suffered in 
concentration camps and death camps during 
World War II and the Holocaust. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed 
to; the committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble be agreed to; the pre-
amble, as amended, be agreed to; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

agreed to. 
The committee-reported amendment

TO 
GLOBAL 
NUTRITION 
THROUGH THE MULTI-SECTORAL 
NUTRITION STRATEGY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 379, S. Res. 260. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 260) recognizing the 
importance of sustained United States lead-
ership 
to 
accelerating 
global 
progress 
against maternal and child malnutrition and 
supporting the commitment of the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment to global nutrition through the Multi- 
Sectoral Nutrition Strategy. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the en-
acting clause and insert in lieu thereof 
the following: 
Whereas of all children under 5 worldwide— 
(1) 149,000,000, or 21.9 percent, are stunted or 
chronically undernourished; 
(2) an estimated 7.3 percent, or nearly 
49,000,000, experience life-threatening acute mal-
nutrition (also known as ‘‘wasting’’); and 
(3) more than 40,000,000 are overweight; 
Whereas, in countries highly affected by 
undernutrition, stunting affects 1 in every 3 
children; 
Whereas malnutrition directly or indirectly 
causes 45 percent of all deaths of children under 
5 years of age, a total of 2,600,000 deaths annu-
ally; 
Whereas 
undernourished 
adolescent 
girls 
often suffer impaired cognitive ability and pro-
ductivity, and the future children of those girls 
are at increased risk for low birth weight and 
death; 
Whereas iron deficiency anemia, associated 
with undernutrition, contributes to 1 in 5 mater-
nal deaths, or 20 percent of maternal mortality; 
Whereas poor maternal nutrition contributes 
to poor fetal development and low birth weight,

and an estimated 60 to 80 percent of neonatal 
deaths occur in low-birth-weight babies; 
Whereas a large body of evidence supports the 
benefits of improved breastfeeding practices on 
the short-term and long-term health and devel-
opment of children and their mothers; 
Whereas a growing body of evidence indicates 
that reducing maternal and child malnutrition, 
especially in the critical 1,000-day period be-
tween the beginning of pregnancy and the sec-
ond birthday of the child, is imperative to— 
(1) ending preventable child and maternal 
deaths; 
(2) improving IQ, and physical, brain and 
cognitive development; and 
(3) strengthening the immune systems of chil-
dren; 
Whereas combatting malnutrition is an eco-
nomic issue, as well as a global health issue, 
that is central to reducing poverty and putting 
communities on a path toward greater self-reli-
ance and economic growth; 
Whereas research indicates that— 
(1) adults who were well nourished as chil-
dren earn up to 46 percent more than adults 
who were malnourished as children; 
(2) countries with a very high burden of early 
malnutrition have lower economic growth rates 
resulting from lost income and productivity; and 
(3) the cost of child malnutrition is substan-
tial, with estimated losses in Gross Domestic 
Product of 3 to 16 percent and potential impacts 
to the global economy as high as $3,500,000,000 
per year; 
Whereas leading economists and Nobel Laure-
ates have identified improving child nutrition as 
the most cost-effective way to improve global 
health outcomes and enhance development; 
Whereas the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy 
of the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID) recognizes that it is in 
the national interest of the United States to help 
developing countries reduce malnutrition by ad-
dressing the direct and underlying causes of 
malnutrition; 
Whereas the linkage between humanitarian 
assistance and development programming under 
the USAID Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy 
helps build resilience to shocks and stresses in 
vulnerable communities, promotes greater self- 
reliance, and is essential to reducing long-term 
reliance upon other forms of United States for-
eign assistance; 
Whereas, in addition to providing bilateral 
support, the United States plays a leading role 
in supporting the goals of Scaling Up Nutrition, 
a global movement of 60 countries to prioritize 
nutrition through effective policy and dedicated 
national resources, particularly during the 
1,000-day window of opportunity between the 
beginning of pregnancy and the second birthday 
of the child; and 
Whereas, despite the significant progress in 
reducing 
undernutrition 
since 
1990, 
global 
progress has been too slow— 
(1) to ensure that undernutrition no longer in-
hibits a child’s ability to attain a full and pros-
perous future; and 
(2) for the global community to reach the glob-
al nutrition targets set for 2025: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, 
That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that— 
(A) malnutrition is a universal issue that no 
country can afford to overlook; 
(B) food security and good nutrition in early 
childhood saves lives and lays the foundation 
for healthy physical and cognitive growth and 
development; and 
(C) the potential life-long health and eco-
nomic benefits of early childhood nutrition in-
fluence the future of individual children and 
families, as well as entire communities and 
countries; 
(2) acknowledges that effective programs to re-
duce malnutrition are not only lifesaving, but 
also critical to the success of United States for-
eign assistance programs to improve global 
health, end preventable child and maternal 
death, achieve an AIDS-free generation, reach 
starving 
children 
during 
an 
emergency, 
strengthen food security, and accelerate inclu-
sive economic growth; 
(3) affirms that it is in the national interest of 
the United States to help developing countries 
build their own capacity to reduce malnutrition, 
address the direct and indirect causes of mal-
nutrition, and meet the nutritional needs of 
women and children; 
(4) recognizes the effectiveness of the Multi- 
Sectoral Nutrition Strategy of USAID, the U.S. 
Government 
Global 
Nutrition 
Coordination 
Plan, and the U.S. Government Global Food Se-
curity Strategy to address the direct and indi-
rect causes of malnutrition and reach, by 2025, 
the global nutrition targets agreed to at the 
World Health Assembly in 2012; 
(5) supports the goals and principles of the 
Scaling Up Nutrition movement to end global 
malnutrition through— 
(A) greater collaboration between govern-
ments, civil society, international organizations, 
donors, the private sector, and researchers on 
multi-sectoral approaches; 
(B) cost-effective and inclusive approaches; 
and 
(C) improved transparency and accountability 
for results; 
(6) recognizes the significant progress made in 
the fight against global malnutrition, 
(7) recommends accelerating improvements to 
the systems affecting the health and nutritional 
status of women and children through innova-
tive, scaled-up approaches; 
(8) applauds the efforts of USAID to integrate 
effective nutrition programming across relevant 
development sectors; and 
(9) calls for additional transformative efforts 
across relevant sectors at USAID to accelerate 
progress toward ending maternal and child mal-
nutrition, including through— 
(A) country development cooperation strate-
gies that align with national nutrition plans; 
and 
(B) improved and clear methods to track nu-
trition funding and outcomes across all global 
nutrition programs of the United States Govern-
ment, especially those relating to— 
(i) global health; 
(ii) food security; 
(iii) agricultural development; 
(iv) basic education; 
(v) food assistance; and 
(vi) water, sanitation, and hygiene (also 
known as ‘‘WASH’’).

tion be agreed to; that the resolution,

(1) Congress supports the finding on the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China articulated in the 2018 
National Defense Strategy and the 2017 Na-
tional Security Strategy. 
(2) The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–409) established the policy

vance United States national security, eco-
nomic, human rights, and other regional inter-
ests, and for such purposes, Congress has au-
thorized appropriate funding. 
(3) The People’s Republic of China is 
leveraging military modernization, influence op-
erations, and predatory economics to coerce 
neighboring countries to reorder the Indo-Pa-
cific region to the advantage of the People’s Re-
public of China. 
(4) As the People’s Republic of China con-
tinues its economic and military ascendance, as-
serting power through a whole of government

ment of the United States to achieve global pre-
eminence in the future.

fense strategy of the United States is to set the

nomic inducements and penalties, influence op-

IOWAN OF THE WEEK—CHRISTIAN 
VANDEHAAR 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Iowa’s Bondurant-Farrar High 
School’s art teacher Christian Vandehaar for 
his hard work in his community and his contin-
ued contributions to his students’ success. 
Mr. Vandehaar is a true public servant. He 
has been teaching 9th through 12th grade art 
classes at Bondurant-Farrar High School for 
nine years. Mr. Vandehaar received his Bach-
elor of Fine Art degree from Iowa State Uni-
versity and his master’s from Drake University. 
He decided to become an art teacher because 
he enjoys helping others and seeing them 
reach their full potential. 
With help from Mr. Vandehaar’s passion for 
the arts, Bondurant-Farrar High School has 
been recognized as one of Iowa’s top three 
All-State Art Schools, with his school earning 
the number one overall spot in 2018. Students 
from Mr. Vandehaar’s art classes have had 
success at state and national competitions, in-
cluding the Congressional Art Competition. 
Under Mr. Vandehaar, art students from 
Bondurant-Farrar High School have been se-
lected for the Congressional Art Competition 
for five of the past six years. 12 of his stu-
dents have even earned All-State honors with-
in the last four years. The accolades continue 
with three Gold and Silver medals in the Na-
tional Scholastic Competition, two Grant Wood 
Legacy Prize Awards, and a National Scho-
lastic American Vision Medal. 
Outside of the classroom, Mr. Vandehaar 
and his students have worked with the 
Bondurant Community Foundation to create a 
100-foot mural along an area bike path. How-
ever, Mr. Vandehaar’s proudest accomplish-
ment is his Art Canned Food Drive, which 
challenges classes to donate the most canned 
items for their Combat Hunger week. Through 
his initiative, students have donated over 
15,000 items in the last seven years. 
It is an honor to commemorate Mr. 
Vandehaar’s outstanding achievements in his 
school and his community. I have great re-
spect and admiration for our educators and 
am particularly thankful for the strong founda-
tion they are giving our kids. As the mother of 
two boys, I know that a quality education is 
crucial to success. Mr. Vandehaar is not only 
helping his students succeed in the arts, but 
teaching them actively engage with their com-
munity. 
I applaud Mr. Vandehaar for his hard work 
and dedication, and I congratulate him and his 
students for their success. 
RECOGNIZING 
SOUTH 
MIAMI 
MAYOR PHILIP STODDARD’S TEN 
YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Philip Stoddard, mayor of South 
Miami. First elected in 2010, he has gained a 
reputation as one of the most environmentally 
conscious mayors in the United States. 
Ten years ago, Mayor Stoddard imple-
mented term limits for city officials, preventing 
himself from serving more than five two-year 
terms. Now, as he nears the end of his final 
term, Mayor Stoddard can look back on his 
time in office with pride He fundamentally 
changed the standards of public policy in the 
city of South Miami. 
A biology professor at Florida International 
University, Mayor Stoddard made environ-
mental science and conservation a priority for 
the city. He signed laws requiring the installa-
tion of solar panels on new homes and ban-
ning pesticide spraying in the city. Last year, 
he led South Miami to commit to a goal of 100 
percent renewable energy citywide by 2040. 
Mayor Stoddard’s expertise in environmental 
public policy extended beyond South Miami. In 
2015, he helped the Obama administration de-
velop policy to address sea level rise. 
Mayor Stoddard is an inspiration for all of us 
who hope to help South Florida become 
greener and more resilient to climate change. 
I’m grateful for his decade of service and wish 
him all the best in his future endeavors.

SECTION 
1703E(f) 
OF 
TITLE 
38, 
UNITED 
STATES CODE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior Member of Congress, I rise in support 
of H.J. Res. 80, which requires the approval of 
the request of the Secretary of Veterans’ Af-
fairs for a waiver under section 1703E(f) of 38 
U.S.C., which provides for the Veterans’ Com-
munity Care Program. 
As a strong proponent of veteran care, I 
support this resolution because our veterans 
deserve to receive the maximum quality of 
hospital care, medical services and extended 
care services. 
This resolution will improve the quality of 
dental care granted to our veterans by allow-
ing them a more diverse group of dental pro-
viders to choose from, at affordable rates. 
There are a total of 9.1 million enrollees in 
the Veterans’ Affairs Health Care system. 
This resolution gives veterans the oppor-
tunity to use Veterans’ Affairs administrative 
support to search for non-VA, pro bono or dis-
counted dental services. 
Over 580,000 Veterans with comprehensive 
dental care benefits were provided dental care 
in Fiscal Year 2019. 
Veterans identified as Class I, those with a 
service-connected compensable dental dis-
ability or condition, are eligible for any dental 
care needed. 
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 
has created a new community care program 
that allows veterans more choice in health 
care providers. 
These revolutionary modifications will ex-
tend services to over 28,000 veterans within 
the 18th Congressional District. 
The Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center 
in Houston provides a full range of health care 
services that include trauma recovery, mental 
health, and substance dependence programs 
to veterans. 
Waiving section 1703E(f) of 38 U.S.C., 
United States allows the Veterans Community 
Care Program to keep the methods that are 
used for veteran medical services as up to 
date as possible and to ensure that veterans 
have access to dental care when needed. 
I ask my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to vote in support of H.J. Res. 80.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
PEOPLE 
OF TAIWAN FOR HOLDING SUC-
CESSFUL ELECTIONS AND COM-
MENDING PRESIDENT TSAI ING- 
WEN ON HER REELECTION 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the people of Taiwan for 
holding successful elections on January 11, 
2020 and commend President Tsai Ing-wen 
on her re-election. Free and fair elections are 
a core tenet of democratic societies and it is 
encouraging to see the people of Taiwan con-
tinue to enthusiastically embrace their civic 
duty, especially in the face of significant elec-
tion meddling on the part of the People’s Re-
public of China. 
The United States and Taiwan have long 
enjoyed a close friendship, with strong bonds 
forged through our economic, trade, and secu-
rity ties. It is critical that the United States 
never loses sight of the importance Taiwan 
will play in our efforts to assure a prosperous 
and peaceful rise for all our friends and allies 
in the region. 
Taiwan’s dedication to democracy, freedom, 
and the rule of law make it not only a great 
partner for the United States, but a beacon of 
hope for all countries striving to protect and 
further democratic ideals. 
Madam Speaker, I again congratulate our 
friends in Taiwan and President Tsai Ing-wen 
on this momentous occasion.

SCOTT JONES’ QUEST OF ALL 419 
NATIONAL PARKS 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Scott Jones, who last summer 
completed a quest to see all 419 units of our 
National Park System, an impressive feat. Ap-
parently, this wasn’t enough for Mr. Jones 
though, who added all the National Monu-
ments and National Conservation Areas man-
aged by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau 
of Land Management just for good measure. 
On August 26, 2019, Mr Jones became the 
first person to visit all 478 of the federal pro-
tected lands he calls our nation’s Treasured 
Places. 
The list includes some of our most iconic 
and inspiring landscapes (such as Grand Can-
yon and Yellowstone), and places that serve 
to interpret some of our most important histor-
ical lessons (Gettysburg and the Lincoln Me-
morial). Mr. Jones’ travels took him to both the 
best of America, and to places that help us re-
member the turbulent and even unsavory his-
tory that is part of our shared national experi-
ence. Mr. Jones is quick to admit that each 
trip was an education and his experiences at 
many sites were rich opportunities to under-
stand more about himself and about the 
United States. 
For instance, Mr. Jones spoke to local re-
porters about his moving experience at Tope-
ka’s Brown V. Board of Education National 
Historic Site in Topeka, Kansas, which chron-
icles the fight to end school segregation. He 
recalled walking down a hallway lined as video 
of people yelling racial epithets played around 
him—mimicking 
the 
experience 
of 
Linda 
Brown on her walk to school. 
From Topeka to 477 other sites, the Treas-
ured Places quest took almost 15 years and 
involved a lot of travel. Mr Jones started out 
just like anyone would, visiting places close to 
his home in Phoenix, Arizona, but he had to 
venture a bit further than most, with trips to in-
terior Alaska, the Northern woods, and even 
the War in the Pacific National Historical Park 
in Guam, his farthest trip at over 6,500 miles. 
Mr. Jones’ quest was not just a personal 
whim, he used it as an opportunity to inspire 
others. Through his blog and social media, he 
invited anyone interested to follow his adven-
tures. Each of his quests are designed to en-
courage others to ‘‘just get out more’’ at what-
ever ability and with whatever time each of us 
has, whether for just a day trip or an epic ad-
venture. His three slogans: explore eagerly, 
travel cheaply, and adventure often. 
Many of his trips provide examples of how 
achievable and inexpensive it is to visit some 
of our nation’s exceptional public lands. He 
completed this quest while working full-time for 
conservation nonprofits and made a point of 
not counting any visits that were made for his 
job toward completion of the total goal. 
But for Mr Jones, adventuring is a constant 
goal and his thirst for adventures is far from 
slaked. In 2016, to celebrate the 100th anni-
versary of the National Park Service, he took 
an epic trip to visit 100 parks in 100 days. He 
examined every ‘‘World Largest Ball of 
Twine’’—all three of them—while making his 
way to every state in the U.S. In the future, he 
plans to climb to the highest point in every 
county in Arizona and he plans to visit 50 dif-
ferent countries by the time he turns 50. 
A proud graduate of Arizona State Univer-
sity, Mr. Jones is a fanatic supporter of ASU 
Sun Devil football. Ever the explorer, even this 
interest has become another quest—Mr Jones 
has been to 8 of the 12 football stadiums of 
the PAC–12. 
Now that his personal Treasured Places 
quest is complete, Mr. Jones continues to en-
courage others to undertake their own quests 
to visit these places with the help of his 
website, treasuredplaces.us. 
Mr. Jones is an exemplary person, who 
transformed a personal interest in parks and 
special places into a quest that he has shared 
as an inspiring invitation. His efforts truly do 
encourage all of us to make the time and ef-
fort to ‘‘get out there more’’ and enjoy our 
country’s many treasured places.

CONGRATU-

JOYCE 
IRENE 
MARTRATT 
ON 
THE 
OCCASION 
OF HER RETIREMENT 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Joyce Irene Martratt on 
her retirement. 
Born on August 28, 1939, Joyce is a World 
War II survivor of the Japanese occupation. 
After the war, she grew to be fearless and had 
a thirst for knowledge, immersing herself into 
every learning opportunity she could. 
Joyce started her career as an educator, 
teaching a first-grade special needs class at 
the old Barrigada Elementary School. She 
also taught 3rd and 6th grade levels. Years 
later, she obtained a temporary job at the An-
dersen Air Force Base at the Civilian Per-
sonnel Office as a clerk typist, and with her 
hard work and authenticity, she persistently 
thrived. Joyce gained a great deal of experi-
ence over the years as a civilian employee 
and worked within the SAC’s 3960th Civil En-
gineering Squadron Material Control Section, 
Programs and Planning, Operations and Main-
tenance, and eventually moved to the 3960th 
Civil Engineering Squadron’s Commander’s of-
fice, to name a few. In 1974, both needing a 
secretary, the Commander, and Vice Com-
mander determined to integrate the position 
and personally requested for Joyce to accept 
the offer. 
On July 18, 2005, she took her final transfer 
to the 36th Wing Commander, which is where 
the ‘‘Ask Joyce’’ column was developed. The 
column was placed in the Andersen Air Force 
Base paper, ‘‘Pacific Edge’’ and served as an 
informative outlet to learn about Guam’s cul-
ture and society. Due to its immense popu-
larity, the people of Guam still remember the 
details of her column to this day. 
Joyce served alongside notable leaders, 
and amongst the most skilled airmen and civil 
servants who recognized her as a distin-
guished woman of character who cared deeply 
for our island. I thank Joyce for her many 
years of service and wish her the best in a 
much-deserved retirement. 
RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SOUTHERN ILLI-
NOIS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Southern Illinois Healthcare Foun-
dation on its thirty-fifth anniversary. 
Southern Illinois Healthcare Foundation, or 
simply SIHF as its known in the area, had its 
start in 1984 when a group of community lead-
ers recognized the need to attract physicians 
to the Metro-East of the St. Louis Metropolitan 
area. SIHF opened its first site in Centreville 
on January 7, 1985 with a physician, a nurse, 
and a director. Today, SIHF serves 1,100-plus 
patients each day with open arms and a dedi-
cation to providing compassionate, com-
prehensive and efficient care. 
Community collaboration has been the key 
to SIHF’s success. SIHF has fostered a dy-
namic approach to caring that includes shared 
staff, coordinated services and a joint ap-
proach to community problems. To that end, 
SIHF has partnered in collaborative efforts 
with dozens of community, civic, govern-
mental, and various health care groups 
throughout the region. The single focus of 
these linkages has been to improve access, 
expand coverage, and provide the most effi-
cient and effective care possible. The effec-
tiveness of these initiatives has had a pro-
found effect on the area. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure I 
stand to recognize Southern Illinois Healthcare 
Foundation. SIHF has embraced its role of 
being a leading provider of health care for thir-
ty-five years, and in that capacity has bene-
fited thousands, a record of service I am 
pleased to acknowledge today. And with its 
single-minded focus on providing the very best 
health care to the area, I can confidently pre-
dict many more years of success for Southern 
Illinois Healthcare Foundation.

CYBERSECURITY AND FINANCIAL 
SYSTEM RESILIENCE ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Homeland Security 
Committee and its Subcommittee on Cyberse-
curity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innova-
tion, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4458, the 
‘‘Cybersecurity and Financial System Resil-
ience Act of 2019.’’ 
The bill before us requires the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System to 
submit a report to Congress, explaining the 
measures taken to strengthen cybersecurity 
functions within the Federal Reserve System. 
In recent years, cybercrimes across the 
world have become increasingly commonplace 
and a serious threat to the American people. 
In a 2018 Gallup Poll, 71 percent of Ameri-
cans say they frequently or occasionally worry 
about being victims to a cybercrime whereas 
less than 30 percent of Americans worried 
about being victims in a violent crime.

With 
cybercrimes 
like 
the 
WannaCry 
ransomware attack of 2017, which remains 
one of the worst ransomware attacks in history 
with over 150 countries affected and over 4 
billion dollars pilfered by cyber thieves, people, 
businesses, and governments across the 
globe are at risk. 
In the United States, the financial services 
industry suffers from the highest average an-
nual costs due to cybercrimes like data 
breaches, ransomware, phishing, and identity 
theft. 
Over the last 10 years, the Government Ac-
countability Office has found that the number 
of cyber attacks that target federal agencies 
has increased from 5,500 to over 77,000 per 
year. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation will help 
prevent a potential cyber threat to the global 
financial system. 
Requiring increased reporting and informa-
tion sharing for the Federal Reserve will 
strengthen current protocols and create new 
policies to address threats like the destruction 
of information without official authorization, 
malware attacks, and the denial of service ac-
tivities. 
This bill will also lay the foundation for fur-
ther cybersecurity efforts among departments 
and agencies of the Federal Government, for-
eign central banks, and other partners. 
I ask all members from both sides of the 
aisle to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4458.

HONORING STEVE MARTINEZ OF 
EAGLE IDAHO 
HON. RUSS FULCHER 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a fellow Idahoan who reas-
sured, restored, and comforted the community 
of builders in Idaho during a difficult time. 
Sadly, today, I also honor the life and passing 
of Frankie Hickman, who ran the Idaho Build-
ers Contractors Association for 27 years. 
Frankie was the Executive Officer of the Idaho 
Building Contractors Association and a lifeline 
for the community in Idaho. During her final 
months and after her passing, Steve Martinez, 
stepped in to fill the long-time role of Frankie. 
When all were grieving the loss of her pres-
ence at the IBCA, Steve helped to pick up the 
pieces, reassure staff, and maintain a contin-
ued legacy for IBCA. He also helped Frankie 
in the most difficult months of her life, because 
in the end, IBCA was her life. Frankie, unable 
to fulfill her role, entrusted Steve with the ar-
duous task of continuing the hard work at the 
IBCA. Steve has a passion and heart for the 
building industry. It shows in his love for the 
people, customers, and partners at IBCA. He 
follows in his father’s footsteps and serves as 
National Builders representative for Idaho, rep-
resenting Idaho at the National Association of 
Home Builders. Steve displays the qualities 
we all strive to be, and I am honored to show-
case his work for a brief but permanent mo-
ment in the House of Representatives. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MS. KATIE 
MAZZOLA 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Katie Mazzola and her 
service to Virginia’s First District. 
Katie earned her Bachelor of Arts in Political 
Science with a concentration in National Secu-
rity from Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. 
While at Tech, Katie served in the Corps of 
Cadets where she quickly climbed the ranks, 
culminating in Executive Officer who was in 
charge of over 200 cadets. Katie also served 
as a Division Leader for the Coast Guard Aux-
iliary University Programs, commanding 22 
units nationwide. Following a knee injury, 
Katie’s plans to commission into the Coast 
Guard were changed. Ever the servant leader, 
she knew she wanted to continue to serve our 
great nation. 
Katie began her service in my office as an 
intern in the summer and winter of 2016 be-
fore becoming my Staff Assistant in May 2017. 
During her years serving Virginia’s First Dis-
trict, Katie has been on the front line of my of-
fice in many roles, including hiring and training 
our D.C. interns, coordinating tours, assisting 
my staff and me, managing our constituent 
services database, responding to over 36,000 
pieces of constituent mail, and assisting with 
my proactive constituent outreach. Katie has 
also been responsible for a legislative portfolio 
including health, labor, education, workforce 
development, family values, women’s issues, 
and religious issues. Katie has been my lead 
staffer on the Congressional Public Health 
Caucus of which I am a Co-Chair. Additionally, 
Katie successfully created my CTE Task 
Force, shedding light on the importance of 
CTE and STEM programs as a way to cul-
tivate the skillsets needed for students to suc-
ceed in today’s workforce. In addition to her 
official duties, Katie has never missed an op-
portunity to update my office on the most re-
cent Virginia Tech game—Go Hokies. 
Since her first day in my office, Katie has al-
ways upheld the values of honor, respect, and 
devotion to duty in service to the people of the 
First District. Her commitment to servant lead-
ership, constituent services, and integrity are 
without equal. I have no doubt that Katie will 
continue to excel as she begins this new 
chapter—her best and brightest years are still 
ahead. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing Katie Mazzola for her dedicated 
service to Virginia’s First District. May God 
bless Katie as she continues her career in 
public service.

HONORING MR. CHARLES SCHUCK 
HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to Mr. Charles Schuck and cele-
brate his 100th birthday, which occurred this 
past August. From the time he graduated high 
school, he has served our country dutifully in 
many roles including as a Sergeant in the Ma-
rine Corps during World War II, the Chief of 
the Flight Standards Division during the Viet-
nam War, and, most recently, a volunteer at 
his local elementary school. Mr. Schuck em-
bodies the American spirit, and I am honored 
to tell his story here today. 
Mr. Schuck was born on August 5, 1919, in 
New York City and is the son of a German im-
migrant. Growing up he always had a passion 
for aeronautics and mechanics, this led him to 
become an aircraft mechanic upon his gradua-
tion from Stewart Tech. He then worked for an 
airline where he taught Army mechanics avia-
tion skills. Following this, he joined the Ma-
rines and received the rank of Sergeant out of 
boot camp. He was stationed in El Toro, a 
Marine Air Station in California. 
After the war, he joined the Civil Aero-
nautics 
Administration 
where 
he 
quickly 
moved up the ranks from Maintenance Inspec-
tor to Chief of the General Aviation Mainte-
nance Branch. In 1962, he was selected to at-
tend the War College at Maxwell Air Force 
Base and in 1964 was stationed in Hawaii as 
Chief of the Flight Standards Division. Here, 
his experience and expertise proved invalu-
able during the Vietnam War. He has also 
held high positions in the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration and was instrumental in setting 
standards in the Pacific Theater. He received 
both an Outstanding Performance Rating and 
a Special Achievement Award from the FAA 
for his service. He then transitioned to the Ex-
perimental Aircraft Association where he ad-
vised policymakers on aeronautic and aviation 
issues for 21 years until his retirement at the 
age of 81. 
Today, he lives a healthy and happy life and 
continues to teach about patriotism and aero-
nautics. As a volunteer at his local elementary 
school, he engages with children about our 
flag, how airplanes and helicopters fly, and his 
love for our country. He is very much appre-
ciated by the students, parents, and faculty 
alike. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a privilege to 
share the story of Mr. Charles Schuck and 
recognize his exemplary achievements. On 
behalf of a grateful nation, I thank him and 
wish him all the best as he reflects on a cen-
tury full of memories.

helped establish FedEx Custom Critical as 
one of Northeast Ohio’s best workplaces. Her 
efforts have helped the company receive the 
Northcoast 99 award an impressive eighteen 
times. Recognized not just for her leadership 
locally, but also across the country, she was 
a recipient of the 2019 Moves Power Women

Award. Ms. Addicott’s emphasis on workplace 
culture and a teamwork environment serves 
as a model for every American business. 
In addition to her successful business ca-
reer, Ms. Addicott has been a committed lead-
er in the Northeast Ohio community. She is in-
volved in several philanthropic organizations, 
serving on the board of Akron Children’s Hos-
pital, the Greater Akron Chamber, and the 
non-profit organization, For Inspiration and 
Recognition of Science and Technology. She 
is also a trustee at her alma mater, Kent State 
University. 
Without a doubt, Ms. Addicott’s investment 
in our community has made a positive impact 
on the livelihood of thousands of Ohioans. On 
behalf of Ohio’s Sixteenth Congressional Dis-
trict, I offer my sincerest appreciation to Ms. 
Addicott for her service and wish her all the 
best on her retirement.

BARBARA 
BUSH COIN ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of Congress, and an admirer and 
friend of the Bush Family, I rise in support of 
S. 457, ‘‘President George H.W. Bush and 
First Spouse Barbara Bush Coin Act,’’ to re-
quire that $1 coins issued during 2020 honor 
President George H.W. Bush and bullion coins 
issued during 2020 are in honor of Barbara 
Bush. 
President Bush and First Lady Barbara were 
friends of mine, and I have always respected 
and admired their service to this country. 
President Bush was a heroic naval aviator, 
a member of congress, Director of Central In-
telligence Agency, Vice President of the 
United States, and the 41st President of the 
United States, and First Lady Barbara Bush 
was a leading force in our country who worked 
to improve literacy and strengthen American 
families by her prime example as a mother to 
five children and wife to the 41st U.S. Presi-
dent, and mother of sons who were elected 
Governor and one of whom was elected the 
43rd President of the United States. 
President George H.W. Bush moved himself 
and his young family to Texas in 1948 and 
Texans are very grateful to the Bushes for all 
the work they did to improve and strengthen 
Texas and the nation during their lives. 
The minting of a $1 coin and a bullion coin 
to honor these two great Americans will en-
sure that the memory of the 41st President of 
the United States, George H.W. Bush, and 
First Lady Barbara Bush, will live on and be 
celebrated for their hard work and devotion to 
the Constitution and our country.

HONORING DR. EARL LENNARD 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in commemorating the memory of Dr. Earl 
Lennard for his upstanding service as the Su-
perintendent for Hillsborough County Schools 
and Hillsborough Supervisor of Elections. 
Dr. Lennard was born on March 22, 1942 in 
Tampa, Florida where he grew up with nine 
brothers and sisters. He was a part of the first 
graduating class of the University of South 
Florida, earning his bachelor’s degree in edu-
cation in 1963. Dr. Lennard began his teach-
ing career at Ruskin Elementary School, a 
temporary position that evolved into a profes-
sion and lifelong passion. In 1996, Dr. 
Lennard 
was 
named 
Superintendent 
of 
Hillsborough County Schools, where he estab-
lished magnet schools and the school choice 
program, allowing for students to attend 
schools that fit their needs best. Additionally, 
he oversaw the openings of countless schools 
throughout the district to accommodate for the 
rapid population growth in my home of Tampa 
Bay. 
In 2009, I had the honor as Florida’s Gov-
ernor to appoint Dr. Lennard to serve as 
Hillsborough Supervisor of Elections. Dr. 
Lennard’s civic involvement and commitment 
to the Tampa Bay community made my choice 
clear. As Supervisor of Elections, Dr. Lennard 
worked tirelessly to ensure every citizen had 
equal access to the ballot box. 
Outside of his professional life, Dr. Lennard 
worked to benefit his community by serving as 
a Sunday school teacher at Riverview United 
Methodist Church, participating in the Brandon 
Community Foundation, and helping establish 
the Sandy & George Simmons Family Boys &

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 2020 CALI-
FORNIA 
DISTINGUISHED 
SCHOOLS 
FROM 
CALIFORNIA’S 
39TH DISTRICT 
HON. GILBERT RAY CISNEROS, JR. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise today to honor and con-
gratulate ten elementary schools in California’s 
39th District for their selection as 2020 Cali-
fornia Distinguished Schools. The California 
Distinguished Schools Program is a compo-
nent of the California School Recognition Pro-
gram and serves to recognize schools that 
demonstrate outstanding education programs 
and practices. Schools awarded with this dis-
tinction hold the Distinguished School title for 
two years. This year, eligible elementary 
schools in the State of California were identi-
fied through a multiple measures account-
ability system that examines performance and 
progress on state indicators specified on the 
California School Dashboard. Schools were 
identified and selected within two distinct cat-
egories: Closing the Achievement Gap and 
Exceptional Student Performance. 
Elementary schools in California’s 39th Dis-
trict awarded this distinction include: Acacia 
Elementary School (Fullerton School District), 
Blandford Elementary School (Rowland Uni-
fied School District), Buena Terra Elementary 
School (Centralia Elementary School District), 
Charles G. Emery Elementary (Buena Park El-
ementary School District), Golden Elementary 
School (Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School 
District), Hidden Trails Elementary School 
(Chino Valley Unified School District), Killian 
Elementary School (Rowland Unified School 
District), Laguna Road Elementary School 
(Fullerton School District), Laurel Elementary 
Magnet School of Innovation and Career Ex-
ploration (Brea-Olinda Unified School District), 
Mesa Robles School (Hacienda La Puente 
Unified School District), Robert C. Fisler 
School (Fullerton School District), Wedgeworth 
Elementary School (Hacienda La Puente Uni-
fied School District), and Ybarra Academy of 
Arts and Technology (Rowland Unified School 
District). 
As California Distinguished Schools, these 
institutions set the standard for an immersive 
educational climate bound by a student-driven 
learning 
philosophy. 
Exceptional 
student 
achievement in each school is a testament to 
the efforts made by educators to realign peda-
gogical practices to allow for student em-
powerment and engagement. This relies on a 
comprehensive platform that supplements the 
breadth of academic rigor with collaboration 
and social support. Through programs ranging 
from dual immersion to positive behavior inter-
vention, these schools reconcile differences in 
theory and praxis to close achievement gaps 
and instill traits vital to academic success. 
What results is a seamless integration be-
tween teacher guidance and student participa-
tion. It is this attunement to the holistic well- 
being of each student that sets Distinguished 
Schools apart. 
As a strong believer in education and its 
life-changing advantages, there is nothing 
more pleasing than knowing that the commu-
nity I serve is paving a brighter road for the 
academic future of California’s youth. I am 
proud of the tireless efforts made by parents, 
teachers, administrators, and staff to advance 
a scholastic agenda that rewards integrated 
educational experiences. Madam Speaker, I 
ask that you and my honorable colleagues join 
me in congratulating these ten California Dis-
tinguished 
Schools 
for 
this 
tremendous 
achievement in the world of education. I am 
wholeheartedly assured in their ability to guide 
and leave a lasting impact on the students of 
California’s 39th District.

PASSING OF COURTNEY EVERTS 
MYKYTYN 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 14, 2020 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share a word about the untimely 
passing of Courtney Everts Mykytyn. 
In 1954, the United States Supreme Court 
unanimously struck down lawful school seg-
regation in the landmark case of Brown v. 
Board of Education of Topeka. In a unanimous 
decision, the Court stated, ‘‘where the state 
has undertaken to provide it, [education] is a 
right which must be made available to all on 
equal terms.’’ Chief Justice Earl Warren went 
on to state that ‘‘in the field of public edu-
cation, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has 
no place.’’ 
Courtney founded Integrated Schools in Los 
Angeles, California in 2015 to start a grass-
roots movement for school integration. Inte-
grated Schools’ mission states: ‘‘America’s 
schools are more segregated than before the 
Civil Rights Movement. . . . Through national 
organizing to promote local action, we support, 
educate, develop and mobilize families to ‘‘live 
their values,’’ disrupt segregation, and lever-
age their choices for the well-being and fu-
tures for their own children, for all children, 
and for our democracy.’’ 
As champion for educational equity, Court-
ney recognized that school integration is one 
of the most powerful tools to ensure that all 
children have an equal opportunity to reach 
their full potential. She understood that the 
work of integrating our schools can be uncom-
fortable and complicated, and worked to edu-
cate parents and build community coalitions. 
Unlike many school integration efforts that 
place burden solely on families of color, 
Courtney’s mission was also to challenge 
white families to integrate schools. Courtney 
was always intentional in her efforts as she 
boldly stated: ‘‘We’re [white people] the ones 
who kind of made it all [school integration] fail. 
Really fixing it has to be on us.’’ 
Courtney educated white families about how 
true school integration requires both an under-
standing of systemic racism in America and 
the careful work of relationship-building free of 
self-interested agendas and without employing 
a white saviorism mentality. When I think of 
Courtney’s leadership on this important issue, 
I am reminded of the Court’s 1971 opinion in 
Swann v Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Edu-
cation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren. He 
stated, ‘‘. . . [A]ll things are not equal in a 
system that has been deliberately constructed 
and maintained to enforce racial segregation. 
The remedy for such segregation may be ad-
ministratively 
awkward, 
inconvenient, 
and 
even bizarre in some situations, and may im-
pose burdens on some; but all awkwardness 
and inconvenience cannot be avoided . . .’’ 
Courtney understood the consequences of 
segregation for children and our democracy. 
She often spoke about how segregation un-
dermines our core American ideals of fairness 
and equality and worked tireless to help fulfill 
the promise of Brown. Courtney emphasized 
that integrating schools was not about sac-
rifice, but instead about a commitment to 
strengthening our democracy and building a 
better society. I hope advocates and families 
continue her legacy and commitment of fight-
ing for school integration. Further, I challenge 
this body to honor Courtney’s legacy in the 
months and years to come by taking the nec-
essary actions to support and advance school 
integration. 
Madam Speaker, the sadness of the pass-
ing of Courtney Everts Mykytyn is offset by 
her transformative work on school integration. 
Her death is a great loss to the school integra-
tion movement and our country. She will be 
greatly missed. I send my deepest sympathies 
to her loved ones, including her husband, 
Roman Mykytyn, her two children, Stefan and 
Lulu, and the Integrated Schools community.

HOMELESS ASSISTANCE ACT OF 
2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 13, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of congress, I rise in support 
of H.R. 4302, the ‘‘Homeless Assistance Act,’’ 
which amends the United States Housing Act 
of 1937 by adding in a new subsection that 
creates a method for information of homeless 
individuals to be disclosed promptly from 
PHAs to local government and nonprofit orga-
nizations. 
This subsection, subsection ‘C’, would au-
thorize Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to 
disclose relevant client information to local 
government entities and nonprofits in order to 
facilitate housing and services for individuals 
and families experiencing homelessness. 
PHAs can play an important role in a local 
strategy to end homelessness, however PHAs 
are limited by the Federal Privacy Act. 
PHAs can receive information on incoming 
homeless clients, but they must obtain written 
consent from each client before disclosing in-
formation about its client’s housing assistance 
with local government entities and nonprofits, 
which can serve as an unnecessary barrier. 
One of the challenges to serving people 
who are experiencing homelessness is coordi-
nating between various local entities that are 
working together to provide the necessary 
housing and services that cater to the unique 
needs of each individual and family. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development’s ‘2019 Point-in-Time Homeless 
Count & Survey’ collected data showing that 
as of April of 2019 there are 3,938 sheltered 
and unsheltered residents of Houston experi-
encing homelessness. 
The most recent data from the city of Hous-
ton had revealed nearly 69,000 individuals had 
signed up for their waitlist to receive housing 
assistance. 
The Houston Housing Authority (HHA) pro-
vides services to more than 60,000 low-in-
come Houstonians, including over 17,000 fam-
ilies housed through the Housing Choice 
Voucher Program and another 5,500 living in 
25 public housing and tax credit developments 
around the city. 
The Homeless Assistance Act assures that 
the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemi-
nation of information about clients can be dis-
closed not for public consumption, but to other 
home and health services programs for the 
benefit of the client. 
The implementation of subsection ‘C’ would 
allow PHAs to disclose relevant client data 
with local government entities and nonprofits 
for the limited purpose of facilitating the expe-
dited identification, assessment, and linkage of 
individuals 
experiencing 
homelessness 
to 
housing and supportive services. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 4302.
