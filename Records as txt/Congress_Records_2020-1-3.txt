January 3, 2020 
TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF J.P. 
WILES 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of 
one of my closest friends and advisors, the 
late J.P. Wiles. He lived a life of service, first 
as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, and 
later as a Pulaski County Magistrate and two- 
term Mayor of Somerset. 
J.P. was a fiscally conservative leader who 
made a conscious effort to protect and pro-
mote the future success of Somerset and Pu-
laski County. He was adamant about trans-
forming the Monticello Street intersection at 
South Main to improve traffic flow in and out 
of our beautiful downtown area, and I was 
proud to partner with him to build a bridge for 
our hometown. Another notable project that he 
worked diligently on, was the SomerSplash 
Water Park to give local families and young 
people a safe and fun place to spend time to-
gether. Those projects, coupled with his tire-
less efforts to expand low-income housing and 
reliable sewer service, serve as testaments of 
his passion and drive to make Somerset a 
better place to live and visit for years to follow. 
In addition to our shared work on commu-
nity projects, J.P. was by my side on the ear-
liest campaign trails. He remained a loyal 
friend through every challenge and every vic-
tory. What set J.P. apart among leaders was 
his cheerful and encouraging spirit. He would 
often drop by for a visit with a bright smile, 
simply to share a friendly hello and dream of 
future projects, or to plan our next round of 
golf. 
J.P. was a pillar of our community, beloved 
and respected by countless friends and col-
leagues. My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our 
heartfelt condolences to the entire Wiles family 
and his extended circle of friends.

CAPTAIN DELONG RETIRES FROM 
THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PA-
TROL 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding law enforcement ca-
reer of California Highway Patrol Captain Dan 
DeLong, who will retire after 29 years of serv-
ice. 
Captain DeLong graduated from the Cali-
fornia Highway Patrol academy in March of 
1991, spending his first few years in the Cen-
tral Los Angeles, Santa Ana, and Riverside 
area offices. In August of 2004, Captain 
DeLong was promoted to Sergeant where he 
was once again assigned to the Central Los 
Angeles area supervising offices in West-
minster and Riverside, prior to his transfer to 
the CHP Inland Division Investigative Services 
Unit. Captain DeLong was promoted to Lieu-
tenant in January of 2013 becoming the com-
mander of the Morongo Basin area, and in 
2014 becoming the San Bernardino County 
Auto Theft Taskforce Coordinator. In Decem-
ber of 2017, Captain DeLong was promoted to 
the rank of Captain, becoming the Com-
mander of the Victorville Area, where he 
would finish his career. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I offer my sincere congratulations to 
Captain DeLong for his 29 years of service as 
a member of the California Highway Patrol 
and wish him an enjoyable and relaxing retire-
ment. I thank him for his service and his com-
mitment to ensuring the safety and security of 
our community with hard work, dedication, and 
professionalism.

HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, today I offer 
my heartfelt congratulations to the Lower Dau-
phin Lady Falcons on their inspiring play at 
the PIAA 3A Field Hockey Championship. 
Led by legendary coach Linda Kreiser, the 
Lady Falcons were a force to be reckoned 
with in their 2019 campaign, winning 23 of 25 
contests for a final record of 23–0–2. 
Since 1997, the Lady Falcons have won ten 
(10) 3A Championships, with their most recent 
win in 2018. Hoping to repeat their success, 
the Lady Falcons fought valiantly towards a 1– 
1 tie after regulation. The Wilson Bulldogs 
emerged as the victors following a spirited 3– 
2 shootout. 
The dedication and teamwork of the Lady 
Falcons says much about their character—in-
dividually, and as a team. ‘‘Semper Stellas 
Spectemus’’—literally translated, means, ‘‘may 
we always reach for the stars.’’ That’s exactly 
what the Lady Falcons did, and I know will 
continue to do. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congres-
sional District, I commend and congratulate 
the Lower Dauphin Lady Falcons on their 
dedication 
to 
excellence, 
sportsmanship, 
teamwork and success. 
THANKING KATIE HETHERINGTON- 
CUNFER FOR HER DEDICATION 
AND SERVICE TO THE 9TH DIS-
TRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA 
HON. DANIEL MEUSER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I rise today 
to recognize Katie Hetherington-Cunfer, my of-
fice’s Deputy District Director. Katie is moving 
on to serve our community in another capacity 
with the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance as 
their Director of Government and Community 
Relations. 
A lifelong resident of the Ninth District, Katie 
has dedicated her career to the betterment of 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. After 
graduating from Penn State University in 
2006, she went on to dutifully serve our great 
Commonwealth in multiple positions at the 
United States Department of Agriculture, the 
Pennsylvania Landscape and Nursery Asso-
ciation, and later the Pennsylvania Department 
of Environmental Protection serving as the Di-
rector of External Affairs for nearly five years. 
Joining my staff as Deputy District Director 
when I took office in January 2019, Katie 
brought with her a wealth of experience and 
knowledge, and even more importantly a pas-
sion to serve our constituents. With her dedi-
cation to our office’s mission to serve the peo-
ple of Pennsylvania’s Ninth District at the fore-
front, Katie has been a tremendous leader of 
our district staff and a fantastic representative 
of our office in communities throughout the 
district. 
On behalf of myself and my staff, the U.S. 
House of Representatives and the citizens of 
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in thanking Katie 
Hetherington-Cunfer for her service to the 
people of Pennsylvania’s Ninth District and 
wish her the best in her future endeavors.

HONORING THE CITY OF DANIA 
BEACH 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to rec-
ognize the 115th anniversary of the City of 
Dania Beach in Florida’s 23rd Congressional 
District. 
Broward County’s first and oldest city, Dania 
Beach’s historic roots date back to the 1880s 
when 12 Danish families moved from Chicago 
to the area’s first planned settlement, Modello. 
It was soon after that A.C. Frost built the first 
home, the first general store, and became 
Modello’s first postmaster. It was Frost’s build-
ings that eventually housed the area’s first two 
schools.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1648 
January 3, 2020 
The town incorporated in 1904, and since 
many of its 35 residents were Danes, the 
name changed from Modello to Dania. 
In 1910, Russian immigrant Louis Brown 
moved to rural Dania. Brown was the first 
known Jewish settler in Broward County and 
opened Brown’s Department Store on Main 
Street, which is now known as Federal U.S. 1. 
Thanks to settlers such as Frost and Brown, 
Dania continued to thrive, soon growing to 
more than 1,200 residents, and nearly 30,000 
today. It was a small yet resilient community 
that weathered fires and hurricanes that at 
times devastated the town. 
Dania Beach is home to several historic 
properties and sites—the Bank of Dania, the 
Poinciana Hotel, the Dania Library & Women’s 
Club, and several private residences once oc-
cupied by settlers and pioneers. Dania Beach 
is home to the first Florida state park named 
for African Americans. Von D. Mizell-Eula 
Johnson State Park was named for civil rights 
activists Dr. Mizell, the area’s first black doctor 
and Johnson, Broward County’s first NAACP 
president. 
Madam Speaker, it is a great honor for me 
to represent the City of Dania Beach in our 
nation’s capital. I thank Mayor Lori Lewellen, 
the Members of the City Commission, and the 
city’s staff for their many accomplishments 
that have made the City of Dania Beach a 
wonderful place to live, work, visit and raise a 
family.

CONGRATULATIONS 
TO 
ANGELA 
FENG 
FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT’S CRITICAL 
LANGUAGE SCHOLARSHIP 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Angela Feng of Dawson High 
School in Pearland, TX and Princeton Univer-
sity for earning a State Department Critical 
Language Scholarship. 
Angela is one of only 550 students to re-
ceive a scholarship, beating out thousands of 
applicants around the nation. She traveled to 
Baku, Azerbaijan where she spent the sum-
mer studying Turkish while immersed in their 
culture. 
The Critical Language Scholarship is a 
merit-based award that gives American stu-
dents the opportunity to study one of the fif-
teen critical languages to our nation’s world 
engagement abroad. It aims to help students 
increase their fluency in the language they are 
studying and learn more about the culture sur-
rounding it. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I congratulate Angela, 
on her incredible achievement. Her drive and 
dedication to her studies earned her this 
honor. Angela has made Pearland and TX–22 
very proud.

THE 
CALIFORNIA 
HIGH-
WAY PATROL 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding law enforcement ca-
reer of California Highway Patrol Sergeant 
Todd Weichers, who retired on December 27, 
2019 after 31 years of service. 
After completing CHP Academy in 1989, 
Sergeant Weichers was assigned as a traffic 
officer to the Westminster Area. He spent five 
years at this first assignment area before 
being transferred to the Barstow Area. In 
2008, Officer Weichers was promoted to Ser-
geant Weichers, and shortly thereafter was 
transferred to the Mariposa Area. After a brief 
stint back in the Barstow Area, he was trans-
ferred to the Victorville Area in 2011 where he 
has spent the remainder of his career. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I offer my compliments to Sergeant 
Weichers for his leadership, hard work, and 
dedication to keeping our roads safe. While 
retiring from a career is never easy, I wish him 
and his family a relaxing and fulfilling retire-
ment.

HONORING FRANK BERTO 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Frank Berto, who passed 
away on December 8, 2019, at the age of 90 
after a lifetime of exemplary public service to 
his community. 
Born in 1929 in Vancouver, British Colum-
bia, to Frank and Elsie Berto, Mr. Berto at-
tended the University of British Columbia, 
graduating as a mechanical engineer. He soon 
started work for Standard Oil of New Jersey in 
Aruba where he met the love of his life, 
Connie. After marrying in 1956, the couple 
had their first daughter, Frances, and shortly 
thereafter moved to California where Mr. Berto 
obtained his Masters of Science in Mechanical 
Engineering at the California Institute of Tech-
nology. Mr. Berto then began working for 
Standard Oil of California/Chevron where he 
spent the next 28 years rising through the 
ranks to become a senior staff instrument en-
gineer. 
Finally settling in Marin County, CA, Mr. and 
Mrs. Berto would go on to have four more chil-
dren: Joseph, Ben, Tom, and Louise. Mr. 
Berto quickly became active in their Sleepy 
Hollow community, serving as pool chairman, 
board member, and then president of the 
Sleepy Hollow Homes Association. He also 
spent 30 years on the Board of the Ross Val-
ley Fire District and Paramedic Authority. A 
staunch advocate for proper fire and para-
medic training, Mr. Berto served on the Sleepy 
Hollow Fire District Board for 32 years. He 
was also a scoutmaster for Sleepy Hollow 
Troup 50, leading several bicycle, kayak, and 
hiking trips. In addition to his public service 
roles, he also served as a lector for St. Rita’s 
Church in Fairfax, California. 
In 1973, Mr. Berto started writing about his 
love of bicycles and engineering on a part- 
time basis for Bicycling magazine. Mr. Berto 
served as the magazine’s engineering and 
west coast editor, writing over 160 articles for 
19 different magazines in the United States 
and overseas, including re-writing the bicycle 
section in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Mr. 
Berto’s passion for biking inspired him to 
present papers at several international bicycle 
history conferences and write four books on 
bicycles, two of which are considered defini-
tive on the subject. After retirement, Mr. Berto 
enjoyed gardening, spending time with his 
grandchildren, and driving around Marin Coun-
ty in his 1916 Model T Ford. 
Mr. Berto was a well-respected community 
leader who will be remembered for his gen-
erous spirit and commitment to public service. 
He is survived by his wife Connie, their chil-
dren Joseph and his wife Dianne, Ben and his 
wife Marija, Tom and his wife Monica, and 
Louise and her husband Mack, and four 
grandchildren: Peter, Iris, John, and Alex. Mr. 
Berto was predeceased by his daughter 
Frances. While he will be greatly missed, Mr. 
Berto’s legacy will live on through the indelible 
positive impact he had on his many friends 
and family and the community at large.

OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect that I rise today to recognize 
Deborah A. Hartman of Berks County. Mrs. 
Hartman is retiring after over 40 years of dedi-
cated public service with the Bureau of Alco-

Contract Management Agency. 
Mrs. Hartman began her lengthy federal 
government service in 1975, during the Gerald 
Ford administration with the ATF. In 1985, she 
joined the Defense Contract Management 
Agency. There she served in a variety of posi-
tions starting in an administrative role and ris-
ing through the ranks, to her current position 
as Management & Program Analyst for the 
Quality Division of Defense Contract Manage-
ment Agency. Throughout her career, Mrs. 
Hartman has received numerous awards and 
accolades, her dedication to her work and to 
the safety and our nation is evident. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in thanking Mrs. Deborah Hartman for 
her many years of dedicated and honorable 
service, and I wish her the best in the next 
chapter of her life. I am confident that even 
though she is retiring, she will not slow down 
and she will continue to make many valuable 
contributions to our Pennsylvania commu- 
nities.

CONGRATULATIONS 
TO 
COREY 
STANDLEY FOR RECEIVING THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT’S CRITICAL 
LANGUAGE SCHOLARSHIP 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Corey Standley of Seven 
Lakes High School in Katy, TX and the Uni-
versity of Oklahoma for earning the Depart-
ment of State’s Critical Language Scholarship 
last year. 
Corey is one of only 550 students who re-
ceived scholarships. Through the scholarship, 
he traveled to Dushanbe, Tajikistan over the 
summer where he was immersed in the cul-
ture and the Persian language. 
The Critical Language Scholarship is a 
merit-based award that gives American stu-
dents the opportunity to study one of the fif-
teen critical languages to our nation’s world 
engagement abroad. It aims to help students 
increase their fluency in the language they are 
studying and learn more about the culture sur-
rounding it. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I congratulate Corey 
on his outstanding achievement. His commit-
ment to learning and diligence in his studies 
earned him this honor. Corey has made Katy 
and TX–22 very proud.

IN HONOR OF LEONARD 
BERNHARDT 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to one of my constituents, 
Mr. Leonard Bernhardt, who passed away just 
before Christmas. 
Last year, I was pleased to nominate Leon-
ard and his late wife, Georgene, for the Con-
gressional Coalition on Adoption Institute’s An-
gels in Adoption award. Each year, the Con-
gressional Coalition on Adoption Institute se-
lects individuals, families, and organizations 
from across the nation who have dem-
onstrated a commitment to improving the lives 
of children in need of permanent, loving 
homes. 
Leonard and Georgene worked tirelessly 
over the years with Holt International Chil-
dren’s Services to find homes for orphaned 
and abandoned children. They supported fam-
ily preservation programs for children and fam-
ilies in Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Romania, 
India, and Uganda. Their generosity, compas-
sion, and dedication to adoption and helping 
birth families made them stand out in Bea-
verton, Oregon—and around the globe—as an 
extraordinary couple, very deserving of this 
award. 
I was honored to meet Leonard Bernhardt in 
November when he visited Washington, D.C. 
with his family to receive this award. I am sad-
dened by his loss and so grateful for the serv-
ice of Mr. Bernhardt and his family to Bea-
verton, the nation, and countless children and 
families across the world.

HONORING THE LOWER DAUPHIN 
FALCONS’ BOYS SOCCER TEAM 
ON THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP SEA-
SON 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, today I offer 
my heartfelt congratulations to the Lower Dau-
phin Falcons on their inspiring play at the 
PIAA 3A State Soccer Championship. 
Led by coach Gerry Lynch, the Falcons 
were a force to be reckoned with in their 2019 
campaign, winning 18 of 22 contests for a final 
record of 18–3–1. 
This is the Falcons’ fourth championship 
season in five years, and their first win since 
2017. This year, the Falcons contested suc-
cessfully against Northern York’s stout de-
fense, scoring three goals to close out the first 
half. The Falcons held their advantage for the 
remainder of the game. 
These remarkable young men put in their 
full effort and resolve this season—and we are 
incredibly proud of them for their performance, 
success, sportsmanship and teamwork. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congres-
sional District, I commend and congratulate 
the Lower Dauphin Falcons on their dedication 
to excellence. We look forward to their contin-
ued success.

HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding law enforcement ca-
reer of California Highway Patrol Officer Rob 
Grieve, who retired on December 27, 2019

On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I offer my sincere gratitude to Officer 
Grieve for his 28 years or protecting and serv-
ing our community, and I wish him an enjoy-

CONGRATULATING 
SHERIFF 
RAY 
C. GERRINGER ON HIS RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. DANIEL MEUSER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect that I rise today to recognize 
Sheriff Ray C. Gerringer of Montour County. 
Sheriff Gerringer is retiring after 40 years of 
dedicated service to the Montour County com-
munity. His bravery, compassion, and commit-
ment to public safety has made our commu-
nities safer and stronger. 
A lifelong resident of Montour County, Sher-
iff Gerringer has been a leader in law enforce-
ment throughout his long tenure of service to 
our great Commonwealth. After graduating 
from Columbia-Montour Vocational-Technical 
School, he began serving the citizens of 
Montour County in 1977 as a part-time dis-
patcher. Shortly after he served as a full-time 
correctional officer at the county prison. 
In 1986, Sheriff Gerringer became the Chief 
County Detective for the Montour County Dis-
trict Attorney’s office. There he participated in 
hundreds of criminal investigations that re-
sulted in convictions. Sheriff Gerringer was 
elected Montour County Sheriff in 2004 a posi-
tion he has honorably held for the last 15 
years. 
Sheriff Gerringer has dedicated his life to 
protecting and defending the Montour County 
community. The many years he has spent on 
the frontlines of public safety demonstrates his 
selflessness. He has truly answered the call to 
serve. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Sheriff Gerringer on 
his retirement and thank him for his many 
years of dutiful and honorable service.

Mr. Reed was a beloved father of one and 
husband of Mrs. Alisha Reed. A native of New 
Orleans and a graduate of St. Augustine High 
School and Louisiana State University, his 
passion for the law became paramount when 
he earned his Juris Doctorate from Southern 
University. With much perseverance and en-
thusiasm, Mr. Reed soon delved into the chal-
lenging world of criminal cases at the Orleans 
Parish Criminal District Courthouse, where he 
once clerked. He was also a proud member of 
the Orleans Parish Democratic Executive 
Committee (OPDEC), the Louis A Martinet 
Legal Society, and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, 
Inc. 
Mr. Reed was a treasure to us all. He lived 
a fulfilled life doing what he loved to do. We 
are forever grateful to Mr. Reed for his eternal 
impact and we keep his friends and loved 
ones near and dear to our hearts. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and 
legacy of Mr. Morris Reed, Jr.

IN RECOGNITION OF BATTALION 
CHIEF ROBERT K. BROOKS 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 3, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Battalion Chief Robert K. 
Brooks as he retires after 35 years of dedi-
cated service to the Flower Mound Fire De-
partment. Over the course of his career, he 
demonstrated continued commitment to the 
Fire Department by preserving the safety of 
citizens in Denton County and by educating 
future generations about the importance of fire 
safety. 
Mr. Brooks began his career as a dedicated 
volunteer firefighter in January of 1983, earn-
ing a position as a paid firefighter in 1984. His 
continued service to the Fire Department re-
sulted in a promotion to Shift Lieutenant and 
service as the Department’s Emergency Med-
ical Service coordinator. In addition to his du-
ties as a firefighter and paramedic, Mr. Brooks 
played an integral role in the development and 
supervision of the Department’s Safety and 
Fire Education Team as well as the clown pro-
gram. 
In 2014, Mr. Brooks received the honor and 
responsibility of serving as the Training Bat-
talion Chief for the Flower Mound Fire Depart-
ment. In this position, he undertook the task of 
instructing 112 certified firefighters and men-
toring new recruits. Throughout his service as 
Training Battalion Chief, he served as a leader 
and role model to all firefighters of the depart-
ment. 
In addition to his duties at the Fire Depart-
ment, Mr. Brooks never hesitated to invest 
time educating local youth. For over 15 years, 
Mr. Brooks conducted engaging fire safety 
programs for Flower Mound and Highland Vil-
lage elementary school children while dressed 
as Smokey the Bear. In addition to portraying 
Smokey himself, Mr. Brooks wrote the scripts. 
As a commendation for his investment in chil-
dren’s education, he was twice awarded the 
Flower Mound Fire Department Educator of 
the Year award. His service-orientation ulti-
mately also earned him the Rotary Vocational 
Service Excellence Award in 2018. 
From his entry into emergency response as 
a volunteer firefighter to his current position as 
Battalion Chief, Mr. Brooks dedicated his life 
and career to the safety of his community. 
Thanks to his encouragement and commit-
ment to education, his influence not only chal-
lenged young firefighters to become reliable 
and competent defenders of public safety, but 
also encouraged children to learn of fire dan-
gers and implement safety plans. The quality 
of life and community safety Flower Mound 
residents enjoy today is a tribute to Mr. 
Brooks’ dedicated leadership, determination, 
and work ethic. It is my honor to recognize 
Battalion Chief Robert K. Brooks for his public 
service and for the role model he leaves for 
future responders to follow.
