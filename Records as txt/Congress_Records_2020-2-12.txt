DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

SUPPORTING THE EQUAL RIGHTS 
AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, the 
great poet and pioneer of righteous 
rage, Audre Lorde, once said: ‘‘I am not 
free while any woman is unfree, even 
when her shackles are very different 
from my own.’’ 
The year is now 2020, and here we 
women are, still in so many ways not 
fully free, still shackled. 
Today, I rise to affirm the humanity 
and the dignity of all women. I rise in 
strong, unapologetic, righteous support 
of H.J. Res. 79, which will strike the ar-
bitrary deadline for ratification of the 
equal rights amendment, an amend-
ment that should already be the law of 
the land. 
Women 
are 
strong, 
hardworking, 
bright, and resilient. We are the back-
bones of our families, our commu-
nities, and our democracy. We do not 
live in checked boxes; we live in an 
intersectionality of lived experiences 
and identities. Our issues are every-
one’s issues, because our destinies are 
all tied. 
Tomorrow’s vote on H.J. Res. 79 is a 
vote for the preservation of our collec-
tive humanity. 
Despite our commitment to hard 
work, both within our households and 
on the job, we are still paid less than 
our male counterparts. In the Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts, women 
are paid 83 cents for every dollar paid 
to a man; but nationally, women are 
paid only 80 cents for every dollar a 
man is paid. 
Even worse, the modern-day wage 
gap disproportionately impacts women 
of color, with Black women earning 61 
cents, Native women earning 58 cents, 
Latinx women earning only 53 cents, 
and AAPI women making as little as 50 
cents per dollar paid to a White man. 
In addition to pay discrimination, we 
face pregnancy discrimination, dis-
crimination in the criminal legal sys-
tem, sexual and domestic violence, and 
inadequate healthcare access. 
But this isn’t an accident. The Amer-
ican Constitution is sexist by its very 
design. This country’s laws have his-
torically treated us like second-class 
citizens, depriving us of the right to 
vote, to enter most jobs, and to own 
property. 
While some of these injustices may 
cease to exist, we still face tremendous 
barriers to our full participation in so-
ciety. With tomorrow’s vote, we have 
an opportunity to right this country’s 
wrong and to take a stand in the name 
of equality. 
I am honored to be serving and rep-
resenting the Massachusetts Seventh 
Congressional District during these un-
precedented times, where we have a 
record 127 women serving in the U.S. 
House 
of 
Representatives. 
These 
women are some of the fiercest table- 
shakers, justice-seekers, and truth-tell-
ers that have ever served in this august 
body, and it is my privilege and joy to 
call them my sisters in service: 
My sister in service Congresswoman 
ELEANOR
HOLMES
NORTON, who has 
faithfully served the people of Wash-
ington, D.C., for 29 years and continues 
to lead in the fight for D.C. statehood; 
My sister in service Congresswoman 
KATIE PORTER, who is fighting for eco-
nomic justice for domestic violence 
survivors who are financially depend-
ent on their partners; 
My sister in service Congresswoman 
DEB HAALAND, a member of the Pueblo 
of Laguna Tribe, who continues to 
shine daylight on the silent crisis of 
missing 
and 
murdered 
indigenous 
women; 
My sister in service Congresswoman 
RASHIDA TLAIB, whose unique experi-
ences as a Palestinian American have 
given a voice to unheard Palestinians 
around the world fighting for their hu-
manity; 
My sister in service Congresswoman 
LAUREN
UNDERWOOD, 
who 
remains 
clear-eyed in her fight for healthcare 
justice as both a nurse and someone 
living with a preexisting condition; and 
My sister in service Congresswoman 
JACKIE SPEIER, for her leadership on 
this issue and for introducing this crit-
ical joint resolution. 
Tomorrow’s vote is a vote for equal-
ity. It is a vote for fairness. It is a vote 
to actualize the movements built on 
the backs of women.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
FRANK LOSONSKY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the legacy of the last re-
maining AVG Flying Tiger, Frank 
Losonsky, who passed away last week 
at 99 years of age. 
Mr. Losonsky was one of 300 men who 
comprised 
the 
American 
Volunteer 
Group, which sailed to China in 1941 to 
defend against the Imperial Japanese 
in World War II. 
Mr. Losonsky was the crew chief of 
the Hell’s Angels Squadron, where he 
was responsible for maintaining three 
to four, maybe five, aircraft at a time. 
The Flying Tigers were a unique unit 
because most of their pilots and sup-
port personnel were enlisted in the 
United States Army Air Corps, the U.S. 
Navy, and the U.S. Marine Corps, but 
they flew under Chinese colors. 
This elite group was devised and 
commanded by Louisianian and LSU 
graduate Lieutenant General Claire 
Chennault. On his recommendation, 
President Franklin Roosevelt signed an 
order allowing American regulars to be 
lent to the Chinese Air Force. They 
first flew combat 12 days after Pearl 
Harbor on December 20, 1941. 
Mr. Losonsky’s legacy lives on at the 
Chennault Aviation and Military Mu-
seum in Monroe, Louisiana, and we are 
proud to host it. 
Please join me in honoring the con-
tributions of Frank Losonsky and the 
rest of the AVG Flying Tigers to the 
liberation of the Pacific from Imperial 
Japan. 
f 
STARTING OVER ON THE EQUAL 
RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, we will 
soon be voting on H.J. Res. 79, which 
attempts to remove the deadline for 
ratification contained in the equal 
rights amendment, which passed Con-
gress in 1972. 
Over the decades, we have made great 
strides in our Nation in promoting and 
protecting women’s rights. This year, 
we are celebrating the 100th anniver-
sary of the 19th Amendment, which 
guaranteed women the right to vote 
across our country. 
A few months ago, I visited the 
Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum 
in Adams, Massachusetts. It is a small 
but powerful museum that tells the 
story of Susan B. Anthony and her 
work, along with other suffragists, for 
the right to vote and for other rights 
for women. 
When talking about how far we have 
come in equal rights for women, I can’t 
help but think of my own mother, who 
is now in her eighties. When I grad-
uated from eighth grade, she fulfilled 
her goal of graduating from college, 
which she had never had a chance to 
do. When I went off to college, she ful-
filled a lifelong dream and went to law 
school; and, in 1988, she graduated from 
Georgetown University Law School 
with her law degree. It took her a long 
time to finally have these opportuni-
ties, but she persevered and succeeded. 
So I am thinking about my mother 
as well as my wife, who is an actuary, 
and my sister, who is an attorney. I 
think about them when I work on pro-
tecting women from discrimination 
and harassment in the workplace, when 
I work for legislation for equal pay for 
women and for other bills to guarantee 
equal treatment for women. 
The equal rights amendment, as we 
now consider it, was passed by Con-
gress in 1972. There was a 7-year dead-
line placed by Congress on States for 
ratification, just as there had been on 
a 
number 
of 
other 
constitutional 
amendments. At the deadline, three- 
fourths of States had not ratified it. 
This week, Congress will be consid-
ering H.J. Res. 79, which retroactively 
removes the deadline for ratification. 
There is much controversy over wheth-
er this is constitutional. In addition, 
H.J. Res. 79 also requires a simple ma-
jority to pass. 
Article V of the Constitution gives 
Congress the power to propose con-
stitutional amendments but requires a 
two-thirds vote in both the House and 
the Senate. The original resolution in-
troduced in the House this year to re-
move the ERA deadline, H.J. Res. 38, 
required a two-thirds vote in both the 
House and the Senate. 
In addition, we know that the Senate 
is highly unlikely to take up this reso-
lution. So, if Congress is interested in 
the equal rights amendment being 
added to the Constitution, we should be 
considering H.J. Res. 35, which would 
restart the process. 
Just a couple of days ago, Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime sup-
porter of the ERA, said Congress 
should do just this. Justice Ginsburg 
said: 
I would like to see a new beginning. I’d 
like to start over. 
She added: 
There is too much controversy about late-
comers. Plus, a number of States have with-
drawn their ratification. So, if you count a 
latecomer on the plus side, how can you dis-
regard States that have said ‘‘we’ve changed 
our minds’’? 
H.J. Res. 35, which would restart the 
process, could go through committee, 
where it could be debated, potentially 
amended, and then brought to the floor 
for further debate and possible amend-
ment. In doing so, we can clear up any 
points of contention about the impact 
of the ERA and raise a consensus. 
If we truly want to support the addi-
tion of the equal rights amendment to 
the Constitution, this is what we 
should do. I support doing this. Other-
wise, we are simply casting a message 
vote. 
This week when we vote on H.J. Res. 
79, my message is yes. I will be voting 
‘‘yes’’ to demonstrate my support for 
protecting equal rights for my wife, my 
mother, my sister, and for all women.

HONORING BRANDON RENZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great sadness that I 
rise today to recognize the departure of 
a long-term servant of the House, 
Brandon Renz. 
Brandon has served the House of Rep-
resentatives for nearly two decades and 
has been a trusted leader of my staff 
for well over a decade. Most recently, 
he has worked with me and fellow 
Members on the Education and Labor 
Committee as Republican staff director 
and has provided trustworthy counsel 
and excellent organizational prowess. 
He also served as my chief of staff 
during my time in leadership as House 
Republican Secretary and was a re-
spected liaison for me and other Mem-
bers, staff, and House offices over my 
eventful time in that office. 
While Brandon has been a tremen-
dous asset and key contributor in all 
those significant positions, he did some 
of his best work in the same trenches 
that many of our staff do, in positions 
and in rooms that do not receive atten-
tion from C–SPAN or grab headlines. 
Brandon started as a staff assistant 
for a Member from his home State of 
Iowa, Representative STEVE KING, re-
luctantly coming to Washington on the 
recommendation of a friend and only 
after committing to himself that he 
would stay only 1 year. 
In less than 3 years on Capitol Hill, 
Brandon earned a reputation as an as-
tute legislative mind with bedrock con-
servative principles and became my 
legislative director. In him, I found a 
partner who shared my commitment to 
accurate, grammatically correct docu-
ments of all types. 
He labored with me on constituent 
letters and on many important legisla-
tive projects, including providing the 
Puerto Rican people with an oppor-
tunity to express all their preferences 
when considering their territory’s fu-
ture, developing legislation to lessen 
unfunded mandates, and expressing 
Congress’ disapproval of the bailout 
funds expended on the TARP program. 
He also worked as a rules associate 
with the House Rules Committee, sit-
ting through interminable hearings at 
all hours of the day and night. He did 
important work there, ensuring Mem-
bers’ voices were heard and that the 
House could work its will on legisla-
tion considered on the House floor. 
After several years guiding my legis-
lative staff and agenda, he accepted my 
request to serve as chief of staff and 
used his terrific skills to benefit con-
stituents and ensure my offices paid 
back the trust given to them by Amer-
ica’s taxpayers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1051 
February 12, 2020 
b 1015 
After seeing his success there, it was 
easy to entrust the responsibilities of 
staff director to him when I became the 
chairwoman of the House Education 
and Workforce Committee. 
Both then and now in the minority, 
Brandon has been a leader on the issues 
before the committee, including edu-
cation and regulatory reform, govern-
ment accountability, and this week on 
the issue of surprise medical billing. 
It has been a joy to work with and 
learn from Brandon as a colleague and 
as an individual. While his parents 
clearly reared him right, his wise, 
beautiful wife, Kate, has been a key 
part of his recent life. She was, herself, 
a fine staff member in both the U.S. 
House and Senate and is here today. It 
is comforting to know they are passing 
on their principles to their sons, Cole 
and Hunter. Brandon and Kate are an 
example to us all. 
As Brandon leaves the service of the 
House to embark on new responsibil-
ities in the private sector, I thank him 
deeply for his years of dedication to 
the work of the House, to me and my 
constituents, and to our Nation. 
He truly has lived up to the oath he 
swore when he first started with the 
U.S. House of Representatives, to ‘‘sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States,’’ and to ‘‘well and faith-
fully discharge the duties of the office 
on which I am about to enter.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I know he will continue 
to faithfully discharge the duties of his 
future offices, as he did so honorably 
for me. So, sadly, I discharge him to 
that work, so help him God. 
f 
TRUMP’S VISION FOR AMERICA’S 
FUTURE IS BLEAK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, on Mon-
day, the Trump administration re-
leased its budget proposal for fiscal 
year 2021. It was titled ‘‘A Budget for 
America’s Future,’’ but its vision for 
that future is bleak. 
Its vision of the future is the true 
American 
carnage 
that 
President 
Trump described in his inaugural ad-
dress. It envisions an America that is 
less than it can or should be. 
It envisions an America where work-
ing families are left to struggle while 
the wealthy continue to prosper. Rath-
er than expanding economic oppor-
tunity to all, it would force families to 
choose between food and other essen-
tials by cutting nutrition assistance by 
$182 billion so more children and more 
people would go hungry in America, 
the richest nation on the face of the 
Earth. 
It would completely eliminate the 
Community Development Block Grant, 
which helps local communities keep 
millions out of poverty. 
Rather than ensuring healthcare is 
accessible to all, this budget cuts Med-
icaid by $900 billion and slashes Medi-
care by half a trillion dollars, even 
though the President promised he 
would never touch the program’s fund-
ing from that podium just a few days 
ago. 
It would also cut research into life-
saving cures at the National Institutes 
of Health by $3.3 billion—penny-wise, 
pound-foolish. It cuts the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention by 
more than half a billion dollars, at a 
moment when we need to protect our 
people against the coronavirus and 
other public health threats. 
Mr. Speaker, a true budget for Amer-
ica’s future wouldn’t increase the cost 
of attending college, as this budget 
does, by cutting student loan programs 
by $170 billion. The education of our 
young people is our greatest invest-
ment in a successful future. 
This budget discourages those who 
want to serve their communities by 
eliminating the Public Service Loan 
Forgiveness program. It would slash 
the Department of Education’s budget 
by $5.6 billion this year alone, while 
eliminating after-school programs for 
kids. Kids would be less safe, less edu-
cated. 
Ignoring another of his pledges, this 
time 
on 
infrastructure, 
President 
Trump’s budget proposes cutting the 
Department of Transportation by 13 
percent this year and reducing funding 
for the Army Corps of Engineers by 22 
percent, both agencies that deal with 
infrastructure. 
It proposes a future devoid of innova-
tion, as well, eliminating several pro-
grams that fund and promote research 
and innovation to support advanced 
manufacturing, 
new 
energy 
tech-
nologies, and entrepreneurship. On all 
of those, the President’s budget sounds 
the trumpet of retreat. 
This budget promotes a future that is 
less secure by reducing funding for pub-
lic diplomacy and foreign aid. For 3 
years now, and in our fourth year, our 
public diplomacy has been put at risk. 
Moreover, this budget extends the 
2017 tax cuts for the wealthy, while 
once again asserting the debunked and 
discredited theory that the tax cuts 
pay for themselves. They didn’t do it in 
1981; they didn’t do it in 2001 and 2003; 
and they haven’t done it now. 
The evidence is clear: The President’s 
tax cuts for the wealthy did not pro-
vide the trickle-down benefits that he 
promised or give our economy the kind 
of boost he said that it would. Yet, the 
administration is back again, pro-
moting the notion that if we give tax 
cuts for the wealthy one more try, they 
will produce growth well above what 
every mainstream economist projects, 
period. 
This budget is not a serious proposal, 
nor is it fiscally sustainable. Budgets 
are about priorities. The priorities in 
this budget, giving tax cuts to the 
wealthy while cutting the programs 
that 
help 
working 
Americans 
get 
ahead, are the wrong priorities for our 
Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of talk 
about who is going to offer a budget. 
The President has offered a budget, and 
we have offered a budget. And that 
budget, Mr. Speaker, was incorporated 
in the appropriations bills signed by 
the President of the United States. 
We now have an agreement on what 
the level of discretionary expenditures 
will be. So I want to tell my friends not 
only on the Republican side of the 
aisle, but I want to tell everybody in 
America that we have a budget. We 
have set forth our priorities, and those 
priorities were in the bills that we 
passed last year and the President 
signed. 
The marginal increase in those is 
very, very small this year. That was 
the deal that was made between Sec-
retary Mnuchin and Speaker PELOSI. 
We will pass our appropriations bills 
consistent with those priorities that 
we have already articulated at the 
numbers agreed upon, unlike the Presi-
dent of the United States who sent us 
a budget that completely abandoned 
the agreement we made in July, just 8 
months ago, 7 months ago. 
What is the point of making an 
agreement if it is looked at as a ceil-
ing? It is like going and bargaining on 
a house and saying, ‘‘I will pay you 
$100,000,’’ and then coming to the set-
tlement table, and saying, ‘‘Well, I am 
really going to pay you $90,000. That 
$100,000 was just a ceiling.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we are going to pass 
through this House and send to the 
Senate appropriations bills that will 
represent the priorities of the Amer-
ican people, and that budget will be for 
the people. I am hopeful that, one more 
time, we can adopt those priorities, 
have them signed by the President, and 
have no drama about shutting down 
government, as we did not this past 
year. That is our responsibility. That 
is our duty to the American people.

CONGRATULATING 
LIBERTY 
CLARK ON MEDICAL DEVICE IN-
NOVATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Liberty Clark in 
Elk River, Minnesota, for receiving an 
award from Enterprise Minnesota for 
attaining their ISO 9001:2015 certifi-
cation. 
Liberty Clark specializes in precision 
pad printing for medical device and in-
dustrial manufacturers, and this cer-
tification verifies to their clients that 
they are a reliable producer of high- 
quality products. 
The medical device industry in Min-
nesota employs over 30,000 Minneso-
tans, driving our State’s economy by 
producing devices that save lives. Re-
cently, I was able to tour Liberty Clark 
and see firsthand how remarkable this 
company is and how it is contributing 
to the marketplace.

paired with the end-of-the-year repeal

of the medical device tax, are two im-
portant indicators that our best days of 
medical innovation are ahead for our 
manufacturers, as well as the millions 
of Americas who rely on lifesaving 
medical devices. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate everyone 
at Liberty Clark on achieving this cer-
tification, and I thank them for being 
one of the best manufacturers in Min-
nesota. 
HONORING REVEREND GORDON GRIMM 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Reverend 
Gordon ‘‘Gordy’’ Grimm, who passed 
away last month at the age of 86. 
Reverend Grimm was an ordained Lu-
theran minister and a leader in the 
field of addiction recovery in Min-
nesota. Through his work with the 
Hazelden Foundation, he pioneered the 
Minnesota model of treatment, which 
revolutionized addiction treatment and 
brought dignity to recovering alco-
holics and addicts. 
Reverend Grimm’s work was recog-
nized on the national stage. President 
Ronald Reagan selected him as a part 
of the White House Conference for a 
Drug Free America. He also served as a 
goodwill ambassador in Minnesota and 
alongside First Ladies Betty Ford and 
Rosalynn Carter at the United States 
Capitol. 
Reverend Grimm was known not only 
for his work but for his kindness. A 
colleague described him as a man with 
‘‘no sharp elbows, only open arms.’’ His 
life’s work touched so many in need. 
We offer our condolences to his wife, 
Esther; his three children, John, Mary, 
and Jim; and the many who knew and 
were impacted by Reverend Gordon. 
Mr. Speaker, Reverend Gordon’s leg-
acy lives on through his family and all 
the people he helped. I thank him for a 
life well-lived. 
RECOGNIZING BRAXTON BATTAGLIA, A TRUE 
MINNESOTA HERO 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Braxton Battaglia 
of Blaine, Minnesota. 
Braxton is a 10-year-old gymnast who 
is 
currently 
fighting 
B-cell 
acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite the 
overwhelming nature of a diagnosis 
like this, Braxton has shown a drive to 
overcome by focusing on others and 
starting the TeamBrax1 Fund, an effort 
designed to help other kids and fami-
lies at the University of Minnesota Ma-
sonic Children’s Hospital. 
Not surprisingly, Braxton has been 
recognized for her strength and heart 
for service. The University of Min-
nesota’s gymnastics program presented 
her with the Abby Szott Courage 
Award, which recognizes an individ-
ual’s incorporation of gymnastics to 
overcome major life obstacles. She also 
recently received her very own spot in 
the University of Minnesota Gym-
nastics Hall of Fame. 
Braxton is an inspiration to every-
one. While she is currently in remis-
sion, her will to fight will remain as 
strong as ever. Her chemotherapy con-
tinues until 2021. 
We will all continue to pray for 
Braxton and her family. 
Mr. Speaker, Braxton inspires us all 
to help others, even in the midst of our 
own challenges. I thank Braxton, and 
may God continue to bless her and her 
family in the months and years ahead. 
CONGRATULATING SCANDIA INTERNET FOCUS 
GROUP 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Scandia 
Internet Focus Group for receiving the 
Good Neighbor Award for their efforts 
to 
secure 
additional 
funding 
for 
broadband expansion in Scandia, Min-
nesota. 
Because of the focus group’s efforts, 
more than half a million dollars will go 
toward building out internet service 
for more than 200 homes through the 
State’s 
Border-to-Border 
Broadband 
Development Grant Program. 
Building out broadband to the last 
mile will give unserved and under-
served communities access to the dig-
ital world, allowing access to vital edu-
cational resources, telehealth services, 
and an increasing amount of commerce 
done online. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
Scandia 
Internet 
Focus Group, this service will meet and 
exceed the State’s goals for 2022 and 
2026.

AMERICANS MUST BE PROTECTED 
FROM SURPRISE MEDICAL BILL-
ING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, surprise 
medical bills can be financially dev-
astating for families. Patients must be 
protected from this harmful practice. 
As Congress considers solutions to 
this issue, I urge Speaker PELOSI to re-
ject any proposals that include govern-
ment price-setting. 
Setting price controls on private 
transactions gives more power to the 
Federal Government and reduces ac-
cess to healthcare. 
Congress must pursue solutions that 
hold patients harmless, increase trans-
parency, and resolve disputes that 
arise from surprise bills. 
CONGRATULATING MELANI SHAFFMASTER 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Melani Shaffmaster of 
New Castle High School on being 
named the 2019–2020 Gatorade Indiana 
Volleyball Player of the Year. 
This is Melani’s second time honored 
with this title, having led her team to 
three straight volleyball State cham-
pionships. Melani has had a remarkable 
high school career with thousands of 
assists, and kills, and hundreds of aces 
and digs. Not only has she been a mas-
ter on the court, but she has also main-
tained a 3.9 GPA. 
Mr. Speaker, Melani is a true role 
model for any student athlete, and I 
wish her the best of luck in college and 
in her future. 
CONGRATULATING RIVER VALLEY RESOURCES ON 
ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate River Valley Resources 
on celebrating their 30th anniversary. 
On a recent visit to RVR Clearing-
house in Madison, Indiana, I was able 
to witness the wonderful services that 
are provided to both adults and chil-
dren. RVR currently provides programs 
and services in 14 counties in south-
eastern Indiana and central Indiana. 
RVR strives to create a competitive 
workforce through job readiness train-
ing, life skills management, job place-
ment, and is also a Child Care and De-
velopment Fund voucher agent in 12 
counties. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank RVR for the 
wonderful work that they do, and I 
wish them a happy anniversary. 
RECOGNIZING MATT PEIFFER 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Muncie resident and Ball 
State student Matt Peiffer. His Mun-
cie-based organization, A Voice for 
Kids, is one of 30 winners in T-Mobile’s 
second annual Changemaker Challenge. 
The Changemaker Challenge asks 
kids aged 13 to 23 to come up with ideas 
to help their local communities. A 
Voice for Kids advocates for the im-
provement of the foster care system. 
A former child in Indiana’s foster 
system, Peiffer has already helped im-
prove the system, and this award shows 
that people around the Nation are no-
ticing his good work. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Matt and 
A Voice for Kids for making their com-
munity and the Hoosier State a better 
place. 
CELEBRATING SHELBYVILLE ROTARY CLUB’S 
100TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Shelbyville Rotary 
Club for celebrating 100 years of serv-
ice. 
The rotary club has been a beacon of 
service in the Shelbyville community 
for this century. Last year alone, the 
club raised funds for the Shelbyville 
Boys Club Youth Football program, 
Pantry Pals, SCUFFY, the Blue River 
Community Foundation, and Girls Inc. 
The rotary club also provides scholar-
ships for every high school in Shelby 
County. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of 
the Shelbyville Rotary Club for their 
service and dedication to Shelbyville 
and congratulate them on their 100th 
anniversary.

bipartisan support in this Chamber as 
President Trump’s guest for the State 
of the Union. 
For years, Venezuela’s united Social-
ist party has pushed a once prosperous 
country towards desperate poverty and 
open tyranny. 
The wrongful detention of the Citgo 
Six for more than 2 years demonstrates 
the corrupt nature in which Maduro 
will do anything to remain in power. 
The United States and the Organiza-
tion of American States should insti-
tute greater pressure and tighten sanc-
tions against the Maduro regime and 
his cronies in order to support a return 
to a democratic Venezuela. 
I stand with President Guaido and 
the people of Venezuela and call on 
Maduro to step down and release the 
Citgo Six and all political prisoners or 
face greater sanctions. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF WILMER 
PLATE 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of one of Arkansas’s great veterans, 
Lieutenant Colonel Wilmer Plate, who 
recently passed away at the age of 99. 
Will was born in 1919 and began his 
long career of service shortly after the 
start of World War II. Will led numer-
ous missions during the war as a com-
mander of a 10-man crew in a B–24. 
Following the end of World War II, 
Will continued his service for more 
than three decades until his retirement 
from the Air Force as a chief warrant 
officer 4 and shortly after as a lieuten-
ant colonel in the Air Force Reserve. 
Lieutenant Colonel Plate continued 
to provide crucial insight into World 
War II by publishing his memoir enti-
tled, ‘‘The Storm Clouds of War: Re-
flections of a World War II Bomber 
Pilot.’’ 
Will earned numerous medals and 
awards 
for 
his 
service, 
including, 
among many others, the Purple Heart 
and the Distinguished Flying Cross. 
Will was a true American patriot, 
one of which all Americans and Arkan-
sans can admire, and I extend my deep-
est respect, affection, and prayers to 
his friends, family, and loved ones. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF FORREST 
WOOD 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of one of Arkansas’s great outdoors-
men, Mr. Forrest Wood, who recently 
passed away at the age of 87. 
Born in Flippin, Arkansas, Forrest 
was considered a pioneer in the fishing 
industry and the father of the modern 
bass boat. 
He founded Ranger Boats, a bass boat 
company that he designed and built 
principally for black bass fishing with 
his wife Nina. In 1968, Forrest was in-
strumental in the formation of the bass 
fishing tournament circuit. 
As a long-time Arkansas game and 
fish commissioner, he was a strong 
conservationist and devoted to Arkan-
sas, the Natural State. Forrest was 
awarded the Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the Sport Fishing Associa-
tion of America and the BASS Federa-
tion. Forrest was also inducted into 
the Arkansas Game and Fish Founda-
tion Outdoor Hall of Fame and the Ar-
kansas Business Hall of Fame. 
Forrest was an inspiration and friend 
to many across our State, and I extend 
my respect, affection, and prayers to 
his friends, family, and loved ones. 
RECOGNIZING RON CHASTAIN 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Major General 
Ron Chastain for recently being ap-
pointed as the civilian aide to the sec-
retary of the Army. 
General Chastain was born in Paris, 
Arkansas, and was commissioned as a 
second lieutenant in the Army Reserve 
upon graduation from the ROTC pro-
gram at Arkansas Tech University. 
General 
Chastain’s 
distinguished 
military service in the Arkansas Na-
tional Guard spanned nearly four dec-
ades, including service as adjutant gen-
eral and receiving Federal recognition 
as a major general of the line in 2005. 
General Chastain spent over 30 years 
working for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency 
where he was responsible for the ad-
ministration of Federal farm programs 
at the county, district, and State level. 
General Chastain has received nu-
merous 
awards 
and 
decorations 
throughout his career, including the 
Army Distinguished Service Medal, the 
Legion of Merit, and the Bronze Star. 
I thank General Chastain for his dec-
ades of service to our Nation, and I 
wish him well in his new position with 
the U.S. Army.

HONORING KRISTEN MUSGROVE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise 
today 
to 
honor 
Ms. 
Kristen 
Musgrove from Nassau County, Flor-
ida, for having earned the Milken Edu-
cator Award. 
This distinguished award recognizes 
teachers, principals, and educational 
specialists who have made a profound 
impact on their students and school 
communities. 
Ms. Musgrove teaches math to the 
sixth grade students at Hilliard Middle- 
Senior High School and was the only 
teacher in the State of Florida chosen 
for this very prestigious award. 
Our educators are tasked with teach-
ing and inspiring the next generation 
of Americans and Ms. Musgrove has 
gone 
above 
and 
beyond 
as 
dem-
onstrated by preparing and guiding her 
students in the development of valu-
able problem-solving skills. 
In fact, under Ms. Musgrove’s in-
struction, her classes lead the Nassau 
County School District with a 97 per-
cent math proficiency. Ms. Musgrove’s 
dedication to her students extends be-
yond the classroom, as she also offers 
tutoring at a weekly after school math 
camp. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida and the 
grateful students and parents of Hill-
iard 
Middle-Senior 
High 
School, 
I 
thank Ms. Musgrove for her lifelong 
dedication to excellence in the class-
room and congratulate her on receiving 
the recognition she so well deserves. 
HONORING THE HIDTA PROGRAM 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor 30 years of the High 
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area pro-
gram known as HIDTA. This program 
has played a vital role in helping keep 
our communities safe and drugs off our 
streets. 
For the last several years, law en-
forcement officers have been on the 
front line of the opioid crisis that our 
country is facing, and now for the first 
time in decades, the CDC has indicated 
that the overdose death rates are ex-
pected to decline. This is thanks to the 
HIDTA program and our local, State, 
and Federal partners taking down the 
drug smugglers and traffickers. 
I would like to highlight some of the 
incredible officers from the north Flor-
ida HIDTA who received recognition on 
February 6 at the 2020 National HIDTA 
Conference and Awards banquet. 
Winning the team award for Out-
standing Investigative Support Center 
were: Kim Jones, Louis Ceragioli, Joe 
Delaney, Robert Hoisington, Ralph Lit-
tle, Kevin Miller, Stefanie Miller, Paul 
Pilliod, Jared Padilla, and John Wat-
son. 
Winning an award for Outstanding 
Task Force Commander was Florida’s 
own Corey M. Taylor of the Ocala Po-
lice Department. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate each and 
every one of them. These awards are 
well deserved, and I thank them for 
helping to keep our communities safe.

THANKING DR. WILLIAM GRISCOM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate, to honor, and to 
give thanks to Dr. William Griscom, 
the President of Thaddeus Stevens Col-
lege of Technology, who retired re-
cently at the end of January. 
Dr. Griscom, across his 23 years at 
the helm of Thaddeus Stevens, trans-
formed the institution into one of the 
most successful 2-year-degree granting 
institutions in the Nation, boasting an 
over 96 percent placement rate for its 
graduates. In fact, last year, there were 
1,400 employers seeking to fill 4,000 jobs 
all looking to hire Thaddeus Stevens’ 
365 graduates. 
Dr. Griscom increased enrollment at 
the school from nearly 500 students 
when he started in 1996 to over 1,200 
students enrolled today, completing 
capital projects worth tens of millions 
of dollars to increase the school’s ca-
pacity, and led the school through ac-
creditation with the Commission of 
Higher Education Middle States Asso-
ciation of Colleges and Schools.

RECOGNIZING CLERMONT HUGER 
LEE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mrs. 
Clermont Huger Lee for being one of 
the 2020 honorees at the Savannah Col-
lege of Art and Design’s Women of Vi-
sion recognition ceremony. 
During the middle 1900s, Mrs. Lee 
was a true trailblazer in our commu-
nity for her groundbreaking work as a 
landscape architect. In Savannah, she 
became the first female landscape ar-
chitect with her own practice. Addi-
tionally, she was considered the fore-
most expert in re-creating the historic 
landscapes that are so critical to Sa-
vannah’s downtown. 
Although she passed away in 2006 at 
the age of 92, her work is still exten-
sively studied at SCAD and can be seen 
across Savannah in gardens at the Dav-
enport House, the Juliette Gordon Low 
Birthplace, the Owens-Thomas House, 
and more. 
Now, in the 21st century, female 
landscape architects are leading a 
number of important projects across 
the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone in-
volved with the Savannah Women of 
Vision recognition ceremony for hon-
oring such an important woman. 
RECOGNIZING FREDDIE SMITH 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Freddie Smith, who retired this past 
year as pastor of the Sweat Memorial 
Baptist Church in Waycross, Georgia, 
after leading the church for the last 25 
years. 
Leading people to the Word of God 
has been Mr. Smith’s passion since he 
was 13 years old. At the time, he was 
headed with his family to a revival in 
Ocala, Florida, when he asked his fa-
ther to pull over the car so that he 
could walk to the church with the 
day’s guest preacher. The preacher told 
him: Don’t be afraid to walk toward 
the Lord. Pastor Smith started preach-
ing only a few years later. 
During his time at Sweat Memorial 
in the First Congressional District of 
Georgia, the services he led were 
known by everyone in the area for 
being beautifully orchestrated and wel-
coming, reflecting the personality of 
Pastor Smith. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Pastor Smith 
for his work in Waycross over the last 
25 years. Even in his retirement, I 
know he will continue working in the 
community to make it a better place 
to live. 
Congratulations. 
RECOGNIZING SUZANNE SHANK 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Su-
zanne Shank, who is one of the 2020 
honorees at the Savannah College of 
Art and Design’s Women of Vision rec-
ognition ceremony. 
A native of Savannah, Ms. Shank is 
the president, CEO, and cofounder of 
Siebert Williams Shank & Company. 
Under her watch, the company has 
grown from a startup investment bank-
ing firm to now being involved in over 
$2 trillion in municipal and corporate 
bonds. 
In 2010, the company became the first 
female- and minority-owned firm in 
Wall Street history to be ranked in the 
top 10 municipal bond underwriters. 
Additionally, U.S. Banker Magazine 
ranked Ms. Shank as one of the most 
powerful women in finance. 
But her work transcends finance 
through her commitment to mentor 
inner city youth, her service on indus-
try associations, and her work with the 
Spelman College Board of Trustees. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Ms. 
Shank on her honor as a 2020 Savannah 
Woman of Vision. 
Keep up the great work. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank SCAD for hon-
oring this Savannahian, who is a true 
trailblazer. 
RECOGNIZING THE SAVANNAH ART ASSOCIATION 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Savan-
nah Art Association, which will be 100 
years old this February. 
The oldest art association in Georgia, 
it was founded in February of 1920 in 
the basement of Mills B. Lane’s home. 
From there, the Savannah Art Associa-
tion moved to the Telfair Museum and, 
now, has two galleries at Chippewa 
Square and the Savannah/Hilton Head 
International Airport. It has come a 
long way over the 100 years since those 
members meeting in the Lanes’ home. 
Today, the Savannah Art Association 
has over 150 members from all artistic 
levels, beginner to professional, who 
are constantly helping each other and 
improving their techniques. They work 
diligently to make our community a 
better place to live through their ex-
hibits, 
demonstrations, 
workshops, 
education programs, and partnerships 
with local businesses to showcase their 
artwork. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone in-
volved with the Savannah Art Associa-
tion for their work in our area. 
Congratulations on your 100-year an-
niversary. 
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE 
TURNS 100 YEARS OLD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, grow-
ing up on our family farm in rural Kan-
sas, one thing was for sure: Every day 
at about 12:20, over the lunch hour, and 
then again at about 10:20 at night, our 
family would be gathered around the 
television set to watch the latest 
weather forecast for the upcoming day. 
From aviation to agriculture, accu-
rate and timely weather forecasts are 
essential to a number of industries 
across the United States, and espe-
cially to farmers and ranchers back 
home in Kansas. 
150 years ago, on February 9, 1870, 
President Ulysses S. Grant signed into 
law a joint resolution creating what 
was known as the Signal Service, lay-
ing the foundation for what would be-
come today’s National Weather Serv-
ice. 
While the organization has evolved 
over the years, the National Weather 
Service provides important weather 
data, forecasting, and warnings aimed 
at protecting life and property across 
the United States. 
There are four National Weather 
Service offices across Kansas working 
to analyze data and provide timely 
weather information. They are located 
in Topeka, Dodge, Wichita, and Good-
land, and I have had the opportunity to 
visit several of these locations and the 
fine ladies and gentlemen that run 
those stations. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say 
happy 150th birthday to the National 
Weather Service and to say thank you 
for the around-the-clock work they do 
to keep us all safe and informed. 
SURPRISE BILLING 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, if you 
or a loved one has ever experienced a 
medical emergency, you know how 
stressful these situations can be; but 
for far too many, the stress and heart-
ache does not end when help arrives or 
treatment is delivered. 
Nearly one in four Kansans seeking 
medical 
treatment 
either 
through 
planned surgery or emergency medical 
care are hit with a surprise bill because 
the care they received was from a pro-
vider outside of their network. In Kan-
sas, this can happen after a trip to the 
emergency room for, say, a child’s bro-
ken arm, a motor vehicle accident, or 
chest pain. 
Surprise billing may occur when a 
patient receives emergency care from a 
professional outside of their insurance 
network. Unfortunately, surprise bill-
ing can also occur in nonemergency 
situations where a surgery is planned 
out well in advance, but you later find 
out one of the doctors or services was 
not in your plan’s network. 
These unplanned expenses can leave 
Kansans on the hook for thousands—if 
not tens of thousands—of dollars in ad-
ditional medical bills, often depleting

family savings or forcing individuals 
into long-term debt and even bank-
ruptcy. 
The nightmare of unplanned medical 
billing has gone on far too long. Work-
ing alongside the White House and 
President Trump’s leadership and my 
fellow members of the House Doc Cau-
cus, I am proud of the solutions we 
have developed that would put an end 
to the unfair practice of surprise bill-
ing. 
I am encouraged by the widespread 
agreement in Congress to address the 
issue and am optimistic we can agree 
to commonsense policies that Presi-
dent Trump is eager to sign into law. 
We should all be able to agree on sen-
sible reforms that address surprise bill-
ing. Specifically, patients should al-
ways be protected from surprise med-
ical bills when receiving emergency or 
nonemergency care. Patients should 
only pay in-network rates for emer-
gency care, and claims should be set-
tled between healthcare providers and 
the insurer without roping in the pa-
tient. 
In the 21st century, we should expect 
that consumers have a right to accu-
rate, transparent information about 
providers and their network with real 
and honest cost estimates before they 
make healthcare decisions. 
When referring a patient to another 
specialist as a physician myself, I al-
ways told my patients to check their 
health plan’s provider directory, but 
also encouraged them to double-check 
with the physician’s office directly in 
case the information was not up to 
date. 
This process can be confusing, time 
consuming, and unnecessary to physi-
cians’ offices as well as the patients, 
and it is my priority to fix it. These so-
lutions have been more than a year in 
the making, and I am optimistic we are 
very close to accomplishing our shared 
goal of lowering the cost of healthcare 
and ending surprise billing once and for 
all. 
RECOGNIZING STEPHANIE SIGLER 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, later 
today, a Kansan from my district will 
be honored at the Next Generation 911 
Institute’s Annual 911 Honor Award 
Showcase to recognize emergency re-
sponse heroes and leaders from across 
the country for their excellence in 
emergency response. 
Stephanie Sigler works as a 911 
phone operator for the Rice County 
Emergency Communications Center in 
Lyons, Kansas, and will be honored as 
a 911 public safety professional for her 
superior response efforts on the job. 
In April of last year, Stephanie re-
ceived a 911 phone call reporting the 
shooting of a Rice County sheriff and 
undersheriff, which led to an hours- 
long standoff involving numerous law 
enforcement agencies. Thanks to the 
swift and professional job done by 
Stephanie, many lives were spared. 
Hundreds of millions of 911 callers, 
every year, rely on the dedication and 
cooperation of our public safety profes-
sionals like Stephanie. Mr. Speaker, I 
am honored to recognize Stephanie 
Sigler for dedicating herself to help 
Kansans in need. 
I would like to also recognize Rice 
County 
Sheriff 
Bryant 
Evans 
and 
Undersheriff Chad Murphy, who were 
wounded in the shooting, as well as 
those who were heroically responding 
during this situation.

HONORING REVEREND OTIS 
LIVINGSTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to remember Rev-
erend Otis Livingston, a decorated vet-
eran and lifelong resident of Decatur, 
Illinois, who passed away a few weeks 
ago at the age of 90. 
With the exception of his military 
service, Otis spent his entire life in De-
catur. He graduated from Decatur Pub-
lic Schools and spent 33 years working 
as a lead operator at A.E. Staley’s. 
During the Korean war, Otis served 
as a combat medic in the 15th Medical 
Division and the 1st Cavalry Division. 
For his bravery, Otis was awarded a 
Bronze Star and a medal from the 
President of South Korea. 
Otis was strong in his faith and dedi-
cated himself to serving God and his 
neighbors. He served in numerous 
church and community positions, in-
cluding chaplain for the Macon County 
Jail. 
It was in this role that he and his 
wife were inspired by the need to min-
ister to the incarcerated. They founded 
Reach Prison Ministry, which has 
served central Illinois communities for 
decades. 
Otis was a very well-loved part of the 
Decatur community for years. He was a 
true example of public service, and he 
led others to faith by his faith. I know 
the impact he has left on Decatur, and 
I know that he will be truly missed. 
HONORING CRAIG LINDVAHL 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to remember 
Craig Lindvahl, a native of my home-
town of Taylorville, who passed away 
earlier this year after a 4-year battle 
with pancreatic cancer. 
Craig was an award-winning educa-
tor, filmmaker, composer, and author. 
He was a teacher in the Teutopolis 
School District for 34 years. He fol-
lowed his parents, Ron and Ann, who 
taught me in the Taylorville schools. 
My prayers go out to both of them. 
Craig started the Creating Entrepre-
neurial 
Opportunities 
program 
in 
Effingham, a yearlong course for high 
school students designed to utilize 
partnerships that provide an overview 
of business development and processes. 
Today, over 200 schools offer the pro-
gram that Craig created for their stu-
dents. 
Craig was dedicated to his students. 
He served on the Illinois State Board of 
Education, and, in 2015, Craig was hon-
ored as the Effingham County Citizen 
of the Year. He also won an Emmy 
Award. 
As many know, Craig’s mantra for 
himself was: ‘‘Who will be better be-
cause of what I do today?’’ I think it is 
safe to say that everyone who knew 
Craig is better for it. He impacted so 
many throughout his life, and he will 
not be forgotten.

the following prayer: 
Gracious God, we gather today in 
this House of Representatives, in the 
people’s House, to acknowledge that 
You alone are sovereign. Thank You 
that we share in a nation where life, 
liberty, and happiness are inalienable 
rights, rights which we hold as self-evi-
dent. 
We praise You for the responsibility 
we have to do justice, love mercy, and 
walk humbly with You. Give us the 
power to find needs and meet them, 
find problems and solve them, find 
hurts and heal them. 
For every elected official, we ask the 
blessings of civility, truth, wisdom, 
and grace. Even amid diversity, enable 
us to embrace unity. Open our hearts 
in courage and imagination that we 
might envision a better tomorrow 
where Your purpose will prevail on 
Earth as in Heaven. 
Let Your grace and favor rest upon 
us. In the matchless, marvelous, mag-
nificent, majestic name that is above 
every name, we pray and give thanks. 
Amen.

WELCOMING REVEREND LANCE 
WATSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) is recognized 
for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank Reverend Lance 
Watson for his thoughtful opening 
prayer this morning. His service to 
central Virginia and his accomplish-
ments as a spiritual and community 
leader are an example to all of us. 
For more than 30 years, Reverend 
Watson has served as the senior pastor 
of St. Paul’s Baptist Church in the 
Richmond area. Dr. Watson has been 
honored as an outstanding community 
leader, outstanding contributor to edu-
cation, and Minister of the Year by 
multiple organizations, and he leads a 
congregation of nearly 12,000 people. 
While Reverend Watson has focused 
on the spiritual development of the 
community through his ministry, he 
has also supported the social and eco-
nomic development of the community 
in a variety of ways. Under his leader-
ship, St. Paul’s Baptist Church has ini-
tiated a bold plan to build housing, a 
park, an urban farm, and community 
gardens to improve the central Vir-
ginia community. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Reverend Wat-
son; his wife, first lady Rose Watson, 
herself an accomplished singer; and the 
entire Watson family for their service 
to the St. Paul’s community in central 
Virginia. 
I also thank Reverend Watson for 
being here today to offer us inspiration 
through the opening prayer.

UNFAIR TREATMENT OF LIEUTEN-
ANT 
COLONEL 
ALEXANDER 
VINDMAN 
AND 
AMBASSADOR 
MARIE YOVANOVITCH 
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, during 
his testimony before the Intel Com-
mittee, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander 
Vindman had a message for his father: 
‘‘Do not worry. I will be fine for telling 
the truth.’’ 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is a war 
hero who has earned far better than the 
treatment he received from the admin-
istration last week. But this behavior 
should not surprise us. It is part of a 
pattern. 
Let 
us 
remember 
the 
campaign 
waged 
against 
Ambassador 
Marie 
Yovanovitch last year. Ambassador 
Yovanovitch is an exemplary public 
servant who deserved our gratitude. In-
stead, the administration shamelessly 
attacked her and fired her to further 
the President’s personal agenda. 
But I agree with the Ambassador 
when she wrote: 
I remain optimistic about the future. The 
events of the past year, while deeply dis-
turbing, show that even though our institu-
tions and our fellow citizens are being chal-
lenged in ways that few of us ever expected, 
we will endure and we will persist. 
Indeed.

CELEBRATING 
110TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BOY SCOUTS OF 
AMERICA 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this past Saturday, the Boy 
Scouts of America celebrated its 110th 
anniversary. With over 2 million active 
participants, it is one of the largest 
youth organizations in the country. 
Since its founding in 1910, the Boy 
Scouts of America has shaped the lives 
of young men by teaching them char-
acter development, self-reliance, and 
principles of responsible citizenship. 
In my district, the Old Hickory Coun-
cil of the Boy Scouts of America, origi-
nally a single troop organized in Win-
ston-Salem, serves over eight counties 
and has almost 5,000 members. In 2018, 
they provided more than 17,600 service 
hours at local charities and organiza-
tions. 
I congratulate the Boy Scouts of 
America on 110 years of service, and I 
am confident that they will continue 
to 
positively 
impact 
communities 
across our country for many years to 
come. 
f 
VALENTINES FOR VETERANS 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, it can 
be easy to feel disheartened in Wash-
ington amid the partisan strife and bit-
ter political division. I want to take a 
moment to change that narrative and 
thank my district for their profound 
display of community. 
My office is leading a Valentines for 
Veterans drive this week, which en-
courages members of our community 
to make valentines for those who have 
bravely served our Nation. The number 
of heartfelt cards we have seen thank-
ing our servicemembers for their com-
mitment to this country has been truly 
heartening. 
I would like to especially give a 
shout-out to the students in my dis-
trict whose classes have dropped off a 
number of incredibly creative cards: 
Ms. Walsh’s fourth grade class at 
Northside School in Fairport; the Klem 
North Elementary School in Webster; 
TLC Adventure in Child Care daycare; 
the Joseph C. Wilson Foundation Acad-
emy in Rochester; the Mary Cariola 
Center; and my granddaughter Harper’s 
class at Paddy Hill Elementary School 
in Greece. 
I am so proud of our Nation’s vet-
erans and of our community for coming 
together in such a touching display of 
support for them.

CONGRATULATING THE 
GRANDVIEW HIGH SCHOOL ZEBRAS 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate 
the 2019 Grandview High School fight-
ing Zebras football team on back-to- 
back State championship titles. 
For Texans, high school football isn’t 
just a sport; it is a way of life. Each 
week in the fall, we gather under Fri-
day night lights and cheer our team on 
to victory. 
The young men and women and 
coaches on our teams spend countless 
hours running drills, watching film, 
and getting ready for their moment in 
history. 
During the 2019 season, Grandview’s 
dedication paid off, as they defeated 
the Pottsboro Cardinals 42–35 at AT&T 
Stadium for their second straight title. 
On behalf of the 25th Congressional 
District, I congratulate the fighting 
Zebras on their victory, and I wish 
them the very best in the future. 
In God we trust.

THE NEED FOR A MILITARY PILOT 
CANCER INCIDENCE STUDY 
(Mrs. LURIA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to call on my colleagues to join 
me in addressing the need for preven-
tive healthcare for our military’s avi-
ators. As a 20-year Navy veteran, I am 
concerned by the alarming anecdotal 
evidence by former Air Force and Navy 
pilots of increased incidence of cancer 
at a young age due to cockpit exposure. 
We have a duty to ensure that our 
servicemembers receive the best care 
possible. That is why I am introducing 
the Military Pilot Cancer Incidence 
Study Act. This bipartisan bill will 
help the Department of Defense and 
Department of Veterans Affairs under-
stand the causes of cancer among our 
military pilots so that we can ensure 
that our aviators receive the preven-
tive 
cancer 
screenings 
they 
have 
earned through their service to our 
country.

cockpit radiation exposure and cancer,

RECOGNIZING COURTNEY VEATCH 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an outstanding member of my 
staff who has been selected by the 
Trump administration to be the over-
sight counsel for the Department of 
Homeland 
Security, 
Dr. 
Courtney 
Veatch. 
Courtney graduated from the Univer-
sity of North Florida and the Florida 
State University College of Law in 
2015. She has been with my office for 3 
years as a legislative assistant and as 
general counsel. She has been an expert 
on veterans affairs, healthcare, and tax 
policy, and she has always served with 
both grit and grace. 
Because of her love for the law and 
for policy, she also served on the cam-
paigns of Senator MARCO RUBIO and 
Governor Ron DeSantis. 
In 2018, I had the honor of swearing 
her in to the District of Columbia Bar 
in this very building. 
We are so very proud of all Courtney 
has accomplished serving the people of 
the Second Congressional District of 
Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Dr. Courtney Veatch and 
wishing her luck in all of her future en-
deavors.

HONORING 
NAVY 
MIDSHIPMAN 
THIRD 
CLASS 
DUKE 
ANTHONY 
CARILLO 
(Mr. DESJARLAIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
DESJARLAIS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the accom-
plishments of Navy Midshipman Third 
Class Duke Anthony Carillo, who died 
suddenly and unexpectedly, training to 
serve his country in the United States 
military. 
Duke was just 21 years old but had al-
ready distinguished himself as a hard-
working, patriotic American. Duke was 
a gifted student and athlete from Flow-
er Mound, Texas, where he was captain 
of his high school football and wres-
tling teams and earned the highest 
rank of Eagle Scout. 
Kind, generous, and fun-loving, Duke 
enriched the lives of his friends and 
family as well as the lives of his class-
mates at the Naval Academy. 
I knew Duke personally. He was my 
son Ryan’s roommate and best friend 
at Annapolis. 
We mourn his loss. Our country lost 
a dedicated public servant, one of those 
special people whose entire purpose 
was the defense of our great country so 
the rest of us can live in peace. 
Duke never expected acclaim or acco-
lades. He was doing his duty, just like 
his twin brother, Dylan, and younger 
brother, Jake, also midshipmen at the 
Naval Academy, a strong testament to 
the faith and devotion of their parents. 
Though he left us at a young age, we 
can all learn from Duke’s example. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family. 
f 
HONORING CAREER AND 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, February 
is Career and Technical Education 
Month, and I rise today to bring atten-
tion to the importance of technical 
skills to our economy and our edu-
cation system. 
Teaching our students the skills they 
need to thrive in the modern economy 
should be our top education priority. 
Our economy depends on a workforce 
that is capable of doing jobs in the 
fields of welding, automotive, and elec-
trical work, among others. 
While the current state of our econ-
omy is strong, we must strive to re-
main competitive with the rest of the 
world. Developing a highly skilled 
workforce is a key part of that effort 
and a top priority of mine. That is why 
I was happy to see President Trump 
prioritize technical education in his 
budget with a proposed $900 million in-
creased investment. 
I am very proud of our high schools 
and technology centers in Kentucky’s 
First Congressional District that are 
working to equip our students with 
crucial vocational skills. I am hopeful 
that Congress can work to provide 
them with the support necessary to 
build on their success in creating a 21st 
century workforce.

PEGGY WILLIAMS DANIEL: A TRUE 
AMERICAN PATRIOT 
(Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
remarkable life of Peggy Williams Dan-
iel. 
Peggy was a true friend not only to 
me, but, really, to everyone she met. 
A graduate of Lambeth College and 
earning her postgraduate degree from 
the University of Memphis, Peggy 
loved watching and rooting for her 
Memphis Tigers. 
Peggy also knew that her roots were 
in west Tennessee. She was married to 
a great man, Jimmy Daniel, who pre-
deceased her. 
Peggy was an active leader at the 
Girl Scouts, a Cub Scout leader, and 
deeply involved in the political proc-
ess. She and Jimmy worked hard to 
build the Republican Party in west 
Tennessee; and, frankly, there are few 
people that I can think of who are as 
patriotic as Peggy. Peggy was a true 
American patriot. She loved wearing 
her red, white, and blue. 
Peggy’s daughter, Melanie, summed 
it up best when she said: ‘‘Peggy Wil-
liams Daniel entered this world with a 
star-spangled bang and has showered 
all with her firecracker wit and enthu-
siastic energy throughout her colorful 
life.’’ 
Peggy leaves behind her three chil-
dren, my friends: Mike, Melanie, and 
Drew. We will all deeply miss Peggy 
but know that her spirit lives on.

RESTORING LIMITS OF CLEAN 
WATER ACT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, last month, the EPA an-
nounced the new navigable waters 
rules that would replace the disastrous 
waters of the U.S. proposal. 
I strongly support this rule, which 
will finally restore the limits of the 
Clean Water Act, providing farmers, 
ranchers, and landowners true clarity 
on the law’s reach. 
To help bring more certainty to farm 
producers, I recently introduced with 
my 
friend, 
Representative 
COLLIN 
PETERSON, H.R. 5799, the Bridging Re-
sponsible 
Agricultural 
Conservation 
Efforts Act of 2020, which addresses 
wetland 
determinations 
under 
the 
Clean Water Act. 
Under current law, EPA, Army Corps 
of Engineers, and USDA are tasked 
with such determinations on farm-
lands. However, farmers have experi-
enced confusion and undue burdens for 
decades due to the discoordination be-
tween the agencies when making such 
determinations. This bill will foster co-
hesion between the agencies and clarify 
what defines normal farming practices. 
Modernizing modern farming prac-
tices and clearly defining converted 
croplands will bring long-overdue cer-
tainty to this process. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this legislation, which is a win for our 
Nation’s farmers and ranchers. 
f 
AMERICA’S ECONOMY WILL 
CONTINUE TO THRIVE 
(Mr. WILSON OF South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the January jobs report with 
gains is terrific. 
Over 225,000 jobs were created and 
wages increased. New job creation has 
achieved a 50-year high with record 
highs for women and younger citizens. 
I am grateful that President Donald 
Trump and Republican policies have 
put the American economy into high 
gear, reducing taxes and regulations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1058 
February 12, 2020 
This first job report of the decade 
shows that America’s economy will 
continue to thrive in 2020, thanks to 
President Trump. 
Following an acquittal after the im-
peachment hoax; providing a peace 
plan for Israel; inspiring the Nation 
with the State of the Union Address; 
providing new trade agreements with 
China, Mexico, and Canada; and the an-
nouncement of Opportunity Now, this 
job report rounds out another week of 
winning for President Donald Trump. 
All Americans celebrate the lowest 
levels of unemployment ever for Afri-
can Americans, Hispanics, and Asian 
Americans. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

PRESIDENT ON PATH TO 
BALANCED BUDGET 
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, no wonder 
Americans elected a President who 
struck 
a 
chord 
with 
voters 
dis-
appointed with business as usual in 
Washington and with the fake news 
media. 
This week, after the President re-
leased his budget plan, his opponents 
here on the floor and in the media 
breathlessly are spouting fake news, 
falsely claiming that the President’s 
budget cuts Social Security, Medicare, 
and Medicaid. But just like seeing the 
impeachment phone call transcript for 
themselves that exposed the impeach-
ment as a hoax, every American should 
look at the budget for themselves and 
see how fake the claims are that Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are 
cut. 
In fact, what they would see is a 
budget that doesn’t touch Social Secu-
rity and Medicare benefits, and they 
would see a Medicaid budget that not 
only isn’t cut but increases 3.1 percent 
per year. 
By controlling other spending, the 
President’s budget, like all of his three 
previous budgets, actually sets us on a 
path to finally balancing our budget. 
That is much better than the last ad-
ministration, which, in 8 years, never, 
ever submitted a budget that would 
balance. 
f 
RECOGNIZING RANDY ROUTON 
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my friend, Mr. 
Randy Routon, for his nearly 34 years 
of dedicated service in mental health 
as the CEO of LifePath Systems, a 
mental health provider in Collin Coun-
ty. 
Randy’s steadfast leadership helped 
thousands of families and individuals 
throughout our community gain access 
to life-changing mental healthcare. 
Randy’s inspiring dedication was also 
illustrated by his role on many boards, 
committees, task forces, and clubs 
throughout our community. 
I proudly worked with him during my 
time in the State legislature toward 
our shared goal of ensuring everyone in 
Collin County had a chance to receive 
high-quality mental healthcare. 
I know Randy looks forward to 
spending more time with his wife, 
Diane, as well their six children and six 
grandchildren, during his retirement. 
Mr. Speaker, as Randy prepares for 
his next chapter, I ask my colleagues 
in the U.S. House of Representatives to 
join me in thanking Randy for his self-
less and dedicated career of serving 
those around him.

PROTECTING NEWBORNS WHO 
SURVIVE ABORTION 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, the Senate Judiciary Committee 
had a hearing on the Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act. 
In the House, Democratic leadership 
continues to block the near 80 times 
that my Republican colleagues and I 
have tried to consider this legislation 
on this floor, let alone even holding a 
hearing. 
I am willing to bet most Americans 
assume that doctors and nurses will do 
everything they can to help a baby 
that has somehow miraculously sur-
vived an abortion. They would be sur-
prised and sad to know that that is not 
always the case. 
In 2002, Congress recognized the sim-
ple fact that an infant who survives an 
abortion is indeed a person. So why is 
there no legal protection for those new-
born babies who have run the gauntlet, 
who survived and have been born alive 
after a failed abortion attempt? 
It is way past the time to hold abor-
tion providers accountable for ensuring 
the best possible care for any newborn 
baby, despite what the Governor of Vir-
ginia might say, regardless of whether 
that baby survived an abortion. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my colleagues, Whip STEVE
SCALISE 
and Representative ANN WAGNER, for 
their great work on this issue. It is 
time the House passes this important 
legislation to protect the sanctity of 
innocent newborn life.

Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. Chair, I am pleased today to rise 
in support of H.R. 2546, the Protecting 
America’s Wilderness Act. 
As a fourth-generation Coloradan, I 
know how important our public lands 
are to the people of my State and to 
millions of Americans across the West.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1059 
February 12, 2020 
Wilderness areas provide us a glimpse 
of what our world looked like before it 
was taken over by man. They are some 
of the most pristine and majestic areas 
on the planet. 
For many of us, the access that we 
have to these lands is a large part of 
why we are so proud to call our West-
ern States home and why so many oth-
ers come to visit us each year. 
While we may be the stewards of 
some of these lands, our Nation’s pub-
lic lands belong to everyone. We, as 
Members of Congress, should be doing 
everything we can to protect them. 
The bill before us today would per-
manently protect nearly 1.4 million 
acres of land across three States. It is 
one of the largest wilderness protection 
packages Congress has considered in 
over a decade, and it is the largest Con-
gress has considered for Colorado in a 
generation. 
The areas that this bill will protect 
include some of the most unique and ir-
replaceable landscapes that our Nation 
has to offer, from the winding canyons 
of Colorado to the native grasslands of 
California and to the mossy forests of 
Washington State. 
The designations in this bill will do 
more than protect the land itself. They 
will help protect the air we breathe and 
the water we drink. They will help pro-
tect wildlife and some of our favorite, 
world-class recreation areas. They will 
provide a boost to the nearby econo-
mies and help grow our Nation’s multi-
billion-dollar outdoor recreation indus-
try that directly supports thousands of 
jobs across the U.S. 
Perhaps most importantly, in pre-
serving these lands, the bill will do 
what we need to do to further fulfill 
the House’s commitment to takes steps 
to combat the climate crisis. 
Preserving more of our public lands 
is one of the best short-term solutions 
that we, as a Nation, can take to re-
spond to this crisis. Experts agree that 
we must strive to protect 30 percent of 
our public lands by 2030 to protect our 
planet. 
The Protecting America’s Wilderness 
Act combines six bills, each introduced 
by a different Member of Congress. 
Title I of the bill consists of my leg-
islation, the Colorado Wilderness Act, 
which will permanently protect more 
than 600,000 acres of wilderness in over 
32 unique areas. 
For more than 20 years now, I have 
been working closely with a group of 
citizens from my State, as well as 
countless local residents and commu-
nity leaders, to craft and recraft the 
legislation we have before us today. I 
personally have been to most of the 
areas in my bill, by foot, by horse, and 
by raft, to experience the areas for my-
self. I have met with landowners and 
ranchers across my State to get their 
feedback and, when necessary, to ad-
just the bill to address their concerns. 
It includes areas like the dramatic 
ridgeline vistas of Grand Hogback and 
the sprawling plateaus of Little Book 
Cliffs, areas like the stunning red cliffs 
of the Dolores River Canyon that we 
see here in this poster and the winding 
riverways of Browns Canyon, areas like 
the desert slopes of Cross Canyon and 
the highest peaks of the San Juan 
Mountains, places that have been un-
touched by man. 
These are just some of the more than 
1.3 million acres of wilderness this bill 
will protect. It will also add more than 
1,000 river miles to the National Wild 
and Scenic River System and would ex-
pand or designate new recreation areas, 
national monuments, scenic and spe-
cial management areas, restoration 
areas, and trails. 
Mr. Chair, I can’t thank my col-
leagues enough for the work that they 
have done to make this bill a reality, 
especially Representatives HUFFMAN, 
CARBAJAL, CHU, SCHIFF, and KILMER. I 
know each one of them is going to have 
more to say about their individual ti-
tles in this bill, but before I yield to 
them, I quickly want to address my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. 
I recognize that we have ideological 
differences about protecting our public 
lands through designations such as 
these, but I want to encourage them to 
consider the importance of protecting 
not only our Nation’s environment but 
also our economy and our way of life. 
Mr. Chair, I urge them to consider 
our tireless and ongoing efforts to en-
sure that this bill will not just protect 
public lands, but also make a real 
boost to our economy. 
Wilderness is, at its heart, about pro-
viding our fellow Americans with truly 
wild places to escape. If we don’t take 
steps right now to protect those mag-
ical places, then one day, they will no 
longer exist. 
A famous conservationist once said: 
‘‘What a country chooses to save is 
what a country chooses to say about 
itself.’’ 
These areas are without a doubt de-
serving of the highest protections we 
can give them and passing them on to 
the next generation in the same state 
they are in today has always been one 
of our top priorities. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 2546. Re-
gardless of what the House does, this 
bill is not going to be signed into law, 
and I find it only fair to explain why. 
This package of bills is based on an 
ideological thought process that has al-
ways failed and is going to continue to 
fail. It will fail because this will add 
collectively about 1.5 million new wil-
derness acres. Yes, that is 1.5 million. 
Although we already have about 111 
million, this is going to add another 1.5 
million. 
This bill will fail because the spon-
sors think they are protecting this 
land. In truth, the opposite is true. 
This bill will fail because unmanaged 
land equals fuel load. Fuel load equals 
wildfire. 
Mr. Chairman, according to the In-
surance Information Institute, over the 
last 5 years, an average of 7.86 million 
acres per year has burned in the United 
States. According to the Congressional 
Research Service, about 78 percent of 
that is on public land. 
The wilderness designation is the 
most vulnerable public land there is. 
More wilderness equals more fire. More 
fire equals more carbon, somewhere in 
the region of about 40 tons per acre 
when a wildfire burns. 
And it gets worse. If a forest burns, 
that is God’s best tool for absorbing 
greenhouse gases, and that is de-
stroyed. That is like taking out your 
lungs. 
Mr. Chairman, I can’t count the num-
ber of times that I have heard the term 
‘‘climate change’’ since I have taken 
office. The same people sponsoring 
these bills, the climate change fight-
ers, are fighting to increase one of the 
most major causes of just that. 
So, yes, this bill will get stalled. It 
may pass the House, but it will fail. 
And all this land happens to be in the 
west, Colorado, Washington, California. 
It is easy if you are from Connecticut 
or New York or some other eastern 
State to vote for a 1.5-million-acre wil-
derness designation somewhere in the 
western U.S. and then not have to ex-
plain to constituents the real impact. 
You can go home and say I expanded 
wilderness, saved all this land. 
Well, guess what, it does impact your 
constituents and here is why: 
Creation of wilderness, scenic rivers, 
and monuments is a creation of an-
other Federal dependent. Disease and 
fire are inevitable on these lands. 
Those of us who live in those States or 
surrounding States, we are trying to 
govern in those States, and under these 
designations, you just can’t touch it 
until there is a fire, and then you have 
to fight it. Those States that are help-
ing make this decision, your constitu-
ents are subsidizing us. 
Now, the Senate and the President 
know that this is not right. The Senate 
and the President know that having 47 
States in this case decide what happens 
in three is not right, so they will stall 
this bill. I am simply hoping to raise 
the truth in this situation in a way 
that will at least make people think. I 
am not naive about what is going to 
happen with this bill. 
This package designates about 100,000 
acres of national monument expansion, 
so I will use the same argument there. 
Ditto. It also has 843 miles of wild sce-
nic rivers. Just to drive home a point, 
please know this, sometimes our fish 
need some human help, and this des-
ignation will prevent that. Sometimes 
our fires create devastating silt flow 
into our waterways, and that would 
need some human help, but we won’t be 
able 
to 
do 
it 
under 
these 
cir-
cumstances. 
Massive new management burdens on 
a Federal Government already $2.3 tril-
lion in debt. Mr. Chairman, our Federal

Government is in over its head already. 
We can’t afford to manage what we 
have already got, so we don’t. 
This is the wrong bill for the West. It 
is the wrong bill for Idaho. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. HUFFMAN). 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, 
and I also thank her for her leadership 
not just on her own bill, but for leading 
the charge on a package of bills that 
includes my Northwest California Wil-
derness, Recreation, and Working For-
ests Act as Title II. 
The lands in my district that are in-
cluded in this legislation represent 
some of the most biodiverse eco-
systems and exciting outdoor opportu-
nities in California. It ranges from old 
growth trees that are so critical for 
carbon sequestration to rivers that 
provide habitat and unparalleled fish-
ing and boating to mountain trails 
that offer hiking, biking, and other 
unique backcountry experiences. 
Being active in the outdoors, experi-
encing these wild places, and con-
necting to a healthy environment is a 
way of life in the Second District of 
California. My constituents and visi-
tors from around the State and around 
the country take pride in these public 
lands, and we all depend on the ecologi-
cal resources and economic benefits 
that they provide. That is why my leg-
islation takes a multifaceted approach. 
First, it includes an ambitious res-
toration plan to improve forest health, 
promote fire resilience, and protect 
communities while restoring diverse 
ecosystems that are naturally adapted 
to fire and that provide fish habitat. It 
would also establish a partnership to 
restore public lands and waters that 
have been damaged by illegal mari-
juana growth sites, which pose signifi-
cant threats to public health and safe-
ty, law enforcement, wildlife, and 
water quality. 
Second, it recognizes the importance 
of the outdoor recreation economy. In 
my district, residents spend almost $2 
billion in outdoor recreation each year. 
This legislation would increase rec-
reational opportunities and spur tour-
ism by proposing new visitor centers, 
overnight lodging, and a significant ex-
pansion of trails for multiple uses, in-
cluding 
hiking, 
biking, 
horseback 
riding, and off-highway vehicle use. 
Expanding these recreational oppor-
tunities benefits outdoor enthusiasts 
and the local businesses that are an in-
tegral part of the recreation economy. 
Investing in our public lands means 
that we are also investing in commu-
nities near our public lands. 
As Kent Collard of the Bar 717 Ranch 
in Trinity County told the Natural Re-
sources Committee last year, ‘‘The best 
thing we can do for these lands, for 
businesses like mine that depend on 
untrammeled tracts of wilderness, is to 
protect them. Like many other busi-
nesses in this area, ours is fueled by 
people seeking to experience the wild 
beauty of Trinity County. The North-
west California Wilderness, Recreation, 
and Working Forests Act recognizes 
and promotes economic opportunities 
that recreation presents to our rural 
communities.’’ 
Economic 
opportuni-
ties. 
Third, this legislation would protect 
important wild places on public lands 
in my district. It designates roughly 
262,000 acres of wilderness, 51,000 acres 
of potential wilderness, and 480 miles of 
wild and scenic rivers. 
These areas include critical habitat 
for endangered salmon and steelhead, 
rare native plant ecosystems, and some 
of the largest intact old-growth forests 
in California. These areas also include 
some of the best fishing, hiking, and 
white-water runs in the State. 
Like other pieces of legislation in the 
package we are considering today, this 
takes conservation seriously because it 
is urgently needed for the future of our 
planet. 
Lastly, I would like to explain how 
this bill was developed. Over more than 
3 years, in fact, not long after I came 
to Congress in 2013, I started asking 
stakeholders what policy issues should 
be addressed in public lands legislation 
in my district. I have repeatedly sat 
down 
with 
constituents, 
presented 
these proposals at public meetings, and 
discussed concerns with county super-
visors. I have moved boundaries and re-
moved wilderness proposals because of 
concerns from landowners, the timber 
industry, and Tribes. This level of 
stakeholder participation means that I 
have focused on what people in north-
west California want to see with their 
public lands. I think this comprehen-
sive, carefully crafted legislation has 
broad support. 
The ACTING CHAIR (Ms. JUDY CHU 
of California). The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Chair, I yield 
the gentleman from California an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Chair, I want 
to point out this bill has support from 
conservation 
organizations, 
outdoor 
recreation groups, dozens of businesses, 
community 
leaders, 
adjacent 
land-
owners. It is a long and broad list of 
support. 
Madam Chair, I request a favorable 
vote for this legislation. 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Chair, I yield 
21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Chair, 
I 
thank my colleague from Idaho for 
yielding. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 2546. This 
package of land bills will impact Cali-
fornia, Colorado, and Washington cre-
ating nearly 1.5 million acres of new 
wilderness. 
H.R. 2250, one bill included in this 
package will impact northern Cali-
fornia, my area. It adds 262,000 acres of 
new wilderness designations, despite 
concerns from local communities as to 
how they would be impacted. 
We have seen the devastation that 
wildfires cause in northern California 
time and time again, so why are we 
putting more land into this restrictive 
wilderness category, which will make 
it even more difficult to properly man-
age forests and to access them? 
Potential 
wilderness 
is 
typically 
treated as wilderness anyway, so you 
have 51,000 acres that will probably be 
enforced as if it were wilderness. 
We should be prioritizing forest man-
agement, not making it more difficult 
for access and the work needing to be 
done desperately. In rural northern 
California, much of the land is already 
owned by the Federal Government. The 
local economies depend on access and 
use of these lands to thrive. 
Seventy-six percent of Trinity Coun-
ty is controlled by the Federal Govern-
ment. Ninety-five percent of the land 
added to wilderness designation by 2250 
is located there. 
The town of Weaverville located in 
Trinity County has had several occa-
sions where fire has burned right up to 
their doorsteps, and even then, we still 
pursue endangering them because these 
lands are not managed. 
Even due to the best efforts of our 
firefighters, our CCC groups out there 
trying get ahead of it, we put ourselves 
behind by having wilderness designa-
tions that take away options, take 
away ability to access and properly 
manage these lands. 
Currently within that county, 520,000 
acres, or 25 percent, are designated as 
wilderness. It would increase that num-
ber to 770,000, or 37 percent of the coun-
ty. 
There are concerns with these lands 
being designated as wilderness that 
should have been addressed with the 
local communities, ranging from ques-
tions about forest management, graz-
ing implications, to road decommis-
sioning 
and 
stewardship 
contracts. 
How does that help the public have ac-
cess? How does that help our fire-
fighters and CCC have access to do the 
work? 
Consensus from these local commu-
nities most impacted by these designa-
tions should be a priority. This legisla-
tion does not do that. 
None of the language changes rec-
ommended to help mitigate local con-
cerns were accepted, so I urge you to 
vote in opposition. 
If it is all about protecting lands, 
what is it we are actually protecting 
when we are endangering them even 
more so? 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Chair, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CARBAJAL). 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Chair, I 
thank 
Representative 
DEGETTE
for 
yielding and for her leadership on this 
very important legislation. 
I am honored to represent the central 
coast of California, one of the most 
beautiful districts in the Nation. 
Places like the Los Padres National 
Forest and the Carrizo Plain National 
Monument contain some of the most

stunning, unique, and diverse eco-
systems 
found 
anywhere 
in 
North 
America. 
Today, I am pleased to support H.R. 
2546, the Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness Act. This bill would preserve the 
ecological beauty and recreational ac-
tivities available to communities in 
my district and beyond as well as for 
future generations. 
This legislation includes my bill, 
H.R. 2199, the Central Coast Heritage 
Protection Act. I am proud to have 
worked with Chairman GRIJALVA and 
Representative 
DEGETTE
and 
local 
stakeholders to ensure that Califor-
nia’s central coast was included in this 
measure. 
Title III of this legislation would des-
ignate and place into conservation 
nearly 250,000 acres as wilderness with-
in the Los Padres National Forest and 
the Carrizo Plain National Monument 
as wilderness areas, one of the highest 
forms of protections available. 
b 1245 
This is a major step to preserve and 
protect our community’s future for fu-
ture generations, allows for responsible 
forest management and firefighting ac-
tivities. 
It also creates a 400-mile-long Condor 
National Recreation Trail, connecting 
the northern and southern portions of 
the Los Padres National Forest by a 
single hiking route. 
This legislation has been the result 
of years of collaboration with local 
stakeholders. It is supported by nearly 
500 central coast landowners, busi-
nesses, farmers, and local officials. 
This reaffirms that protecting our en-
vironment and growing our economy 
are not mutually exclusive. 
Our public lands are an essential 
asset to our local economies. In Cali-
fornia alone, the outdoor recreation 
economy is worth $92 billion and em-
ploys over 650,000 individuals. 
I want to thank Chairman GRIJALVA, 
Representative DEGETTE, and the com-
mittee for their support of this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ and continue uplifting 
local businesses and local economies 
that rely on outdoor recreation. 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Chairman, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chairman, I 
thank the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. 
FULCHER) for his leadership. 
I rise in strong opposition to this 
package of divisive and partisan bills. 
Collectively, this package of ideologi-
cally driven bills impact lands in Colo-
rado, California, and Washington by 
creating nearly 1.5 million acres of new 
wilderness, designating 843 miles of 
Wild and Scenic Rivers, and creating 
100,000 acres of National Monument ex-
pansion. 
In Colorado alone, H.R. 2546 would 
designate approximately 570,000 acres 
of new wilderness areas, 23,000 acres of 
expanded wilderness, and 14,000 acres of 
potential wilderness. These new des-
ignations would be in addition to the 
already existing 3.5 million acres of 
public land in Colorado that is already 
designated as wilderness. 
Now, I commend my colleague from 
Colorado for her efforts to work with 
local shareholders to address some of 
their concerns, but the bills contained 
in this package do not achieve the type 
of balance and local consensus nec-
essary for bills of this magnitude. 
Many of the local communities im-
pacted by this wilderness package have 
raised significant concerns, including 
the loss of motorized access and recre-
ation, the elimination of multiple use, 
and the overall threat to local econo-
mies. If wilderness designation is im-
posed, fewer people will have access to 
these lands. 
Engaging local stakeholders and con-
sidering their on-the-ground expertise 
are critical steps in making decisions 
about public lands management. Local 
communities have concerns with many 
aspects of this bill. 
At the July 10, 2019, subcommittee 
hearing on this bill, the committee 
heard 
testimony 
from 
Montezuma 
County Commissioner Keenan Ertel, 
who shared the county’s concern that 
this bill would negatively impact ‘‘in-
dividual landowners, agricultural enti-
ties, water providers, first responders, 
and especially the recreation tourism 
industry.’’ 
Garfield County also opposes this leg-
islation due to concerns with restrict-
ing access and increased risk of cata-
strophic wildfires due to the restrictive 
management regimes imposed by this 
legislation. 
In addition to local grievances, the 
affected land management agencies 
have noted that this bill is inconsistent 
with previous designations and existing 
land uses by arbitrarily adding wilder-
ness areas and Wild and Scenic Rivers 
in areas where those designations are 
not appropriate. Supporting the dec-
laration of areas that do not actually 
possess these characteristics under-
mines the integrity of the Wilderness 
Act and the Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act, as well as the existing lands that 
do possess those features. 
Because of these concerns, the Trump 
administration has rightly issued a 
veto threat against this partisan bill. 
To quote from the Statement of Ad-
ministration Policy: ‘‘This bill would 
impose unnecessary and harmful re-
strictions on more than 2.5 million 
acres of land in Colorado, California, 
and Washington State, including near-
ly 1.5 million acres in the form of wil-
derness designations. These restric-
tions will greatly reduce opportunities 
for multiple uses on these public lands, 
limit access to them, and significantly 
reduce the available productive acre-
age in working forests, rendering them 
more prone to catastrophic wildfires.’’ 
This highly partisan package is in 
stark contrast to the omnibus lands 
package that was passed overwhelm-
ingly last year by both Chambers and 
signed into law by President Trump. 
That package was the most sweeping 
conservation legislation in the last 
decade. It had begun under the Repub-
lican House and was successful because 
it featured the input of a wide coalition 
of our colleagues, and it earned the 
support of a broad, diverse coalition of 
advocates for public lands, economic 
development, and conservation. 
Mr. Chair, we are wasting our time 
here. I ask my colleagues to oppose 
this legislation. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CARBAJAL). 
The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I would 
point out to my close friend from Colo-
rado (Mr. LAMBORN) that there are no 
multiple use areas in the Colorado Wil-
derness Act. Two-thirds of the areas 
are already wilderness study areas and 
being converted, and the rest have no 
motorized use or mining or drilling of 
any kind. So the bill has no conversion 
of multiple use areas. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
2546, the Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness Act. This legislation includes the 
text of my bill, H.R. 2215, the San Ga-
briel Mountains Foothills and Rivers 
Protection Act, which is the result of 
years of grassroots advocacy and com-
munity engagement to improve protec-
tions and access for these treasured 
lands. 
The San Gabriel Mountains are the 
crown of the Los Angeles area. They 
provide 30 percent of our water, com-
prise 70 percent of Los Angeles Coun-
ty’s open space, and are home to his-
toric habitats of species like the Cali-
fornia condor and Nelson’s bighorn 
sheep. 
This immense natural beauty exists 
right in the backyard of one of the 
densest urban areas in our country, of-
fering recreational opportunities like 
hiking, fishing, and camping to the 
more than 15 million Americans who 
live in the urban area nearby. 
That is so important because the Los 
Angeles region is one of the most park- 
poor areas in the country, which means 
that too many communities do not 
have access to outdoor recreational op-
portunities in their own neighbor-
hoods. 
Access to outdoor space has real, doc-
umented benefits for public health. 
That is why protecting these lands is 
so important. 
In 2014, President Obama recognized 
the decades of grassroots support for 
this goal and granted my request to 
designate the San Gabriel Mountains 
National Monument. Immediately, this 
made available more resources to the 
mountains that resulted in cleaner riv-
ers, improved facilities like picnic

portantly, it brought the entire com-
munity together to develop a manage-
ment plan for the San Gabriel Moun-
tains, with over 40 members rep-
resenting a variety of stakeholders, 
such as water agencies, local govern-
ments, and the business community. 
But we are still far from done. This 
same level of resources and protection 
is needed across the San Gabriel Moun-
tains and the communities that serve 
as their gateway. 
The legislation before us today would 
build on the success of the National 
Monument designation by expanding 
the monument’s boundaries to include 
the western Angeles National Forest, 
establishing new and expanded wilder-
ness areas, and protecting more than 45 
miles of waterways as Wild and Scenic 
Rivers. 
It would also establish the critical 
new San Gabriel Mountains national 
recreation area to bolster the connec-
tion between urban and wild spaces, 
helping communities in the foothills 
and along the river corridor improve 
access to the mountains and offer new 
recreational 
opportunities 
for 
Angelenos. 
This bill represents the work of so 
many, and they have come together for 
a plan that would complete the vision 
of a community seamlessly connected 
to the beautiful wild lands of its back-
yard. 
Today, we have an opportunity to re-
alize that vision, and that is why I urge 
support for H.R. 2546, the Protecting 
America’s Wilderness Act. 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Chair, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, 
when the Republicans were in the ma-
jority, we set three overarching objec-
tives for our Federal lands policy: to 
restore public access to the public 
lands, to restore good management to 
the public lands, and to restore the 
Federal Government as a good neigh-
bor to those communities impacted by 
the public lands. This bill is the very 
opposite of these three policies. 
The purpose of America’s public 
lands was to set aside our most beau-
tiful tracts, in the words of the original 
Yosemite Charter, ‘‘for public use, re-
sort, and recreation . . . for all time.’’ 
The bill before us does exactly the 
opposite: It imposes severe restrictions 
on the public’s use of 2.5 million acres 
of their own lands; 1.5 million acres 
would be put off limits to such inno-
cent things as mountain bikes and 
strollers; and it would remove roads to 
reach campsites or even allow emer-
gency equipment to access. It also des-
ignates 843 additional miles of our riv-
ers as wild and scenic. 
Does anybody think that sounds 
good? 
I can tell my colleagues that that 
designation on the Merced River in my 
district has been used to close many 
traditional tourist amenities at Yo-
semite 
Park, 
including 
swimming 
pools, raft and bike rentals, horseback 
riding stables, and ice skating and 
lodging facilities. 
‘‘Public use, resort, and recreation’’ 
becomes ‘‘Look, but don’t touch.’’ 
The health and vitality of our forests 
depends on active scientific forest 
management. That means carefully 
tending our forests to protect them 
from morbid overcrowding, which, in 
turn, makes them vulnerable to dis-
ease, pestilence, drought, and, ulti-
mately, catastrophic wildfire. 
Excess timber comes out of the forest 
in one of two ways: It is either burned 
out or it is carried out. This bill makes 
good forest management impossible by 
forbidding our foresters from using 
their science to protect and groom and 
care for our forests by assuring that 
trees have room to grow strong. 
Finally, this bill ignores and insults 
the communities directly affected by 
this massive Federal land grab. In case 
after case, local elected officials, local 
governments, local fire districts, and 
local residents in the nearby commu-
nities have formally, vigorously, and 
vocally protested the draconian re-
strictions imposed by this measure be-
cause they imperil public safety from 
fire, and they do wanton harm to the 
local economies. 
This bill reverses the three objectives 
set by House Republicans: 
Instead of restoring public access to 
public lands, the Democrats restrict 
and deny it; 
Instead of restoring good manage-
ment to the public lands, the Demo-
crats forbid it; 
Instead of restoring the Federal Gov-
ernment as a good neighbor to those 
communities impacted by the public 
lands, the Democrats give those com-
munities the finger. 
What Obama said about elections 
having consequences, here it is in real 
life. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. NAPOLITANO). 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chair, I 
thank Ms. DEGETTE for yielding. 
I rise today in very strong support of 
H.R. 2215, the San Gabriel Mountains 
Foothills and Rivers Protection Act, 
which is included in H.R. 2546, and I as-
sociate my remarks with those of Ms. 
CHU, my distinguished colleague. 
As the representative of the San Ga-
briel foothills community, I am very 
proud of our community members and 
local organizations that have worked 
tirelessly on preserving and expanding 
the mountains for future generations. 
The San Gabriel Mountains, foot-
hills, and river corridor attract mil-
lions of visitors a year and provide 
some of the only outdoor options for 
the open space-poor Los Angeles Coun-
ty. 
H.R. 2215 expands the boundaries of 
the monument and allows the San Ga-
briel Mountains, foothills, and river 
corridor to be eligible for Federal fund-
ing to help clean, protect, and develop 
our beloved mountain recreation areas. 
The bill will improve recreation op-
portunities for millions of families and 
bring much-needed resources to the 
communities that serve as the gateway 
to the mountains, while respecting 
local rights. Water agencies and com-
munities from the area all agree this is 
a good thing. 
As California has continued to be 
faced with drought, forest fires, and 
the growing impacts of climate change, 
it is critical that we support policies 
such as this that protect our environ-
ment. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
b 1300 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I would 
like to thank my friend from Idaho for 
yielding. 
The legislation before us today rep-
resents the same failed policies that 
have caused recent fire seasons to be 
some of the worst on record. Over 1.5 
million acres of new wilderness is cre-
ated by this bill. 
Mr. Chairman, a wilderness designa-
tion is the most restrictive land classi-
fication that can be levied by the Fed-
eral Government. Wilderness designa-
tions such as these greatly hinder Fed-
eral and local agencies’ ability to ac-
tively manage our forests, which great-
ly enhances the risk of catastrophic 
wildfires. 
Just yesterday, I hosted a roundtable 
with stakeholders from across the West 
representing local governments, State 
governments, 
animal 
conservation 
groups, and private companies that are 
developing 
groundbreaking 
tech-
nologies to help us fight the threat of 
catastrophic fire. Every participant in 
the panel spoke to the importance of 
actively managing our forests. 
Wildfire prevention saves money, 
human lives, and protects vital wildlife 
habitats. Passage of this bill puts all of 
that at risk. 
This legislation also represents an-
other attempt by the majority to legis-
late in other Members’ districts with-
out their support. I especially want to 
highlight the provisions in this bill 
dealing particularly with Colorado. 
The vast majority of the 700,000 acres 
of new wilderness created by this bill 
in Colorado is located in Mr. TIPTON’s 
district and Mr. LAMBORN’s district. 
Neither of these Members support this 
legislation. 
This is a continuation of legislation 
previously taken up by this House re-
stricting mining in my district that I 
did not support and attempts by the 
other side to restrict mining in north-
ern Minnesota and oil and gas develop-
ment in ANWR completely against the 
wishes of local Members of Congress as 
well as people back home. 
Legislation like this before us today 
flies in the face of what public lands 
legislation should be. It should be lo-
cally driven and benefit those who live 
closest to those lands.

This legislation does none of that. In-
stead, it applies a top-down approach 
to land management, with decrees 
being levied from Washington, D.C., 
without the input of local stake-
holders. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this disastrous legislation. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
strong support of the Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness Act. 
This bill includes a number of worthy 
initiatives to expand and protect our 
national heritage, and I am very 
pleased and grateful that the legisla-
tion includes the Rim of the Valley 
Corridor Preservation Act, a bill I have 
been working on for nearly 20 years. 
The Rim of the Valley Corridor Pres-
ervation Act would expand the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area to include the lands known as the 
Rim of the Valley. This includes Simi 
Hills, 
Santa 
Susana 
Mountains, 
Verdugo Mountains, part of Santa 
Clarita, San Gabriel Mountain foot-
hills, the Los Angeles River, and Grif-
fith Park, all important green spaces 
in the greater Los Angeles region, one 
of the park-poorest regions in the 
country. 
By expanding the national recreation 
area, the National Park Service will 
have the authority to make capital im-
provements, 
like 
repairing 
hiking 
trails and maintaining facilities for 
public enjoyment, studying wildlife 
and its habitats, and participating in 
cooperative conservation with local 
landowners. It will help ensure wildlife 
corridors that allow Los Angelinos to 
experience lions, bears, and other pre-
cious wildlife in their own backyard. 
Protecting and embracing our na-
tional spaces is very important to me 
personally. I come from a hiking fam-
ily. My wife, Eve, and I love to go on 
hiking trips with our friends or when 
we can steal away during the summer, 
evening hikes through Griffith Park. 
From time to time, I like to run alone 
in the Verdugos, with a little extra 
pace at certain points, knowing that 
one of P–22’s mountain lion friends 
might be watching me from the tall 
grass. 
Last week, I asked my constituents 
to send some reflections about what 
the Rim of the Valley means to them, 
along with their favorite pictures of 
the natural beauty of our region, and 
you can see just a sampling of the 
beautiful vistas that they sent behind 
me. 
I want to say, I think my constituent 
Donald from Sunland put it best when 
he said: ‘‘I appreciate how the calm 
beauty of undeveloped nature replen-
ishes my spirits. Everyone, including 
future generations, should be able to 
access unspoiled nature.’’ 
We owe it to ourselves and our chil-
dren and grandchildren to safeguard 
these treasures. The Rim of the Valley 
Corridor Preservation Act plays an im-
portant role in this effort. 
I want to thank Chairman GRIJALVA 
and his staff for their work on this leg-
islation. I want to thank my colleague, 
DIANA DEGETTE. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2546. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
today in opposition to a completely 
partisan bill in H.R. 2546, legislation 
that grows the reach of the Federal 
Government 
and 
strong-arms 
local 
stakeholders. 
To my colleagues in California and 
Colorado who are involuntarily af-
fected by this legislation, I stand with 
you. 
Like them, I represent a vast district 
with significant Federal lands. Min-
nesota’s Eighth Congressional District 
is the size of West Virginia. It features 
two national forests, a national park, a 
wild and scenic river, and a wilderness 
area. 
Like them, I have a colleague from 
an urban area in my State legislating 
in my district, as if they know what is 
best for our constituents and we don’t. 
About a month ago, a colleague rep-
resenting part of the Twin Cities area 
of Minneapolis-Saint Paul introduced a 
mineral 
withdrawal, 
putting 
over 
235,000 acres off-limits. In northern 
Minnesota, the Range Association of 
Municipalities and Schools sharply re-
buked this legislation, as the bill 
promises to deprive schools of millions 
of dollars in potential revenue. 
In Colorado, H.R. 2546 is opposed by 
Mesa, Garfield, and Montezuma Coun-
ties because of their concern about the 
impacts this expansion can have on 
their rural communities. 
What many in Washington, D.C., and 
Representatives of urban areas fail to 
recognize is how much this bill affects 
the daily lives of rural constituencies. 
For example, this bill will disallow 
proper forest management. Why not let 
our loggers clear the timber that leads 
to forest fires? 
It will disallow recreational activi-
ties like mountain biking. Why would 
we stop activities like that that help 
grow our local tourism industries? 
The National Guard Bureau is con-
cerned about the high-altitude training 
in this area. Why would we impede the 
readiness of our military? 
Mr. Chairman, the trend of rejecting 
the input of local Members of Congress 
and local stakeholders is troubling. 
Whether it be in California, Colorado, 
or my great State of Minnesota, all our 
constituents ask for is to have a seat 
at the table and their voices heard. 
Please oppose this bill and send a 
message that locals affected by Wash-
ington, D.C., legislation need to be 
heard. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I am 
delighted to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA), 
chairman of the committee. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Colorado 
for the time and for her longstanding 
commitment to public land in her 
State and throughout the Nation. 
I also want to thank all of the spon-
sors from California to Washington 
who have done tremendous work on the 
individual titles that make up the 
package of bills before us today. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
2546, Protecting America’s Wilderness 
Act. 
Congress passed the Wilderness Act 
in 1964 in response to concerns about 
population growth and increasing de-
velopment. The reason for the act is 
more pressing now than ever. 
Since then, wilderness designations 
have served as a key tool for protecting 
pristine places in their natural state 
for the benefit of current and future 
generations of Americans. 
This package truly embodies the 
spirit of the Wilderness Act, something 
that is often dismissed by many of my 
colleagues across the aisle. Each title 
was developed through a multiyear col-
laborative process with diverse and lo-
cally driven coalitions that have dem-
onstrated that these places are worthy 
of protection as wilderness. 
They provided abundant recreational 
opportunities to help support local 
economies, teach visitors about our 
Nation’s diverse heritage, and allow 
people to find solitude and peace in na-
ture. 
They protect some of the last and 
best refuges for wildlife in the face of a 
changing environment and play a vital 
role in safeguarding the natural sys-
tems that our communities rely on. 
As climate change increasingly im-
pacts our natural world, designating 
pristine landscapes as wilderness is one 
of the most important actions Congress 
can take in response to the climate cri-
sis. 
This bill prioritizes the long-term 
conservation of large, connected land-
scapes that provide clean air, clean 
water, critical wildlife habitat, and in-
tact natural systems that enhance 
community resiliency to this climate 
crisis. 
It reflects the heart of the Wilderness 
Act, reminding us of our dependence on 
healthy, natural systems and our re-
sponsibility to ensure a sustainable en-
vironment for future generations. 
It is no surprise that the Trump ad-
ministration would oppose these des-
ignations, given the single-use mission 
of the Trump administration, which is 
extraction and profit being the only op-
tion for our public lands, while this 
legislation before us today represents 
and recognizes that protection and con-
servation are public benefits for all 
Americans. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
H.R. 2546 and the package of legislation 
before us, which will ensure that these 
wild places are protected for the ben-
efit of current and future generations. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. BISHOP).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1064 
February 12, 2020 
after Mr. GRIJALVA, my good friend 
from Arizona, so I can bring some bal-
ance to the rhetoric that we are doing 
because somebody has to realize that 
the ideas of conservation, recreation, 
and economic development in the vast 
territories we have in the West are not 
mutually exclusive. They never have 
been. They never need to be. 
But the bill we have in front of us 
today is very unbalanced. It is pretty 
ideological, and as Yogi Berra used to 
say: ‘‘It’s deja vu all over again.’’ 
This puts 1.5 million acres, as has 
been said, in new wilderness designa-
tions and over 800 miles of wild and 
scenic rivers, which destroys or shuts 
down all forest management activity in 
those particular areas, including things 
like fuel reduction and wildfire mitiga-
tion. 
To put this in perspective for some of 
you, especially those in the East, in 
the last 10 years, 7.3 million acres of 
our most restricted public lands have 
been burned out. That is like burning 
the entire State of Massachusetts, all 
of which was set in this kind of restric-
tive area. 
Now, what the majority wants to do, 
what the Democrats want to do, is add 
more to that potential problem. It is 
unbalanced simply because there is not 
a single Republican who has cospon-
sored any of these bills in this package, 
including the two Colorado Repub-
licans who are most directly impacted 
by this package. 
This puts critical military-readiness 
training at risk. This has concerns for 
private property that have never been 
resolved in elements of this package. It 
doesn’t even address the local con-
sensus. 
This is a bill that the Senate will not 
pass, that the President has already 
said he is going to reject. 
Earlier in this session, as we began, 
we had a lands package that came 
through. It was a consensus between 
Democrats and Republicans both here 
and in the Senate. Many of these bills 
were not part of that consensus land 
package, and for justifiable reasons, 
because they haven’t reached that con-
sensus status. 
It hasn’t happened before, which 
means—you know, Earl Weaver once 
came out and got thrown out of a game 
because he looked at the umpire and 
said: Are you going to get better, or is 
this as good as it gets? 
We are looking at the other side and 
saying: Are you going to get better, or 
is this simply as good as it gets? 
What we should be doing is realizing, 
instead 
of 
creating 
more 
problem 
areas, we should be trying to solve the 
problem of the land we already own. I 
am specifically talking about H.R. 1225, 
the Restore Our Parks Act. We have a 
maintenance backlog in our parks that 
is huge and a solution to it that actu-
ally works. Why are we not bringing 
that bill to the floor instead of this 
bill, which is destined to fail? 
We all talk a big game about how 
much we revere our national parks, yet 
when we had the opportunity to do 
something about it with a bill that has 
330 sponsors and cosponsors, we have 
the chance of doing it, we don’t. 
For some reason, the Democrats 
don’t decide to bring that up on the 
floor so it can move along. Instead, 
they bring packages up here that cre-
ate more wilderness, more problems, 
and more costs without having solved 
any of the underlying problems with 
these packages, which is why they 
weren’t in the consensus bill we had at 
the beginning of the session in the first 
place. 
We can do better. We need to do bet-
ter. We are wasting our time with mes-
saging bills that have no future when 
we have the opportunity to do stuff 
that works. 
I am calling on my friends on the 
other side: Put that bill on the floor so 
we can vote for something that solves 
our problems and saves our parks in-
stead of these simply messaging bills 
that are dedicated to having special in-
terest groups being able to check off 
the box that you did something for 
them. It is about time we did some-
thing that works. 
b 1315 
Ms. 
DEGETTE. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
would just point out to the gentleman 
that when we did the last land package 
none of these bills had been brought up 
for a hearing by the then-majority, so 
the gentleman would not have been too 
happy to have included them in that 
package. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mr. 
NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chairman, I want 
to join my colleagues in support of this 
important lands package which is not a 
messaging bill. It is a bill that will pro-
tect endangered species, improve cli-
mate mitigation, and support our Na-
tion’s growing outdoor recreation econ-
omy. Every component of this bill cer-
tainly accomplishes those ends. 
But, in particular, the Colorado Wil-
derness Act Title I provides Federal 
protections to many of Colorado’s most 
beautiful and treasured lands, and that 
I can attest to as a Representative for 
Colorado’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. 
I am inspired by my colleague, Con-
gresswoman DEGETTE’s dedication and 
her championing of this cause, having 
worked on this bill for the better part 
of the last 20 years. 
It is important that we protect these 
beautiful and treasured public lands for 
generations to come. We have a strong 
tradition of protecting public lands in 
my home State. As the Chair well 
knows, earlier this year we passed the 
Colorado 
Outdoor 
Recreation 
and 
Economy Act out of the House, which 
is an important step in that regard. 
I think at the end of the day we 
should be able to agree on the goal of 
protecting public lands to ensure that 
they exist for future generations, in-
cluding for the generation of my 
daughter who is 18 months old now—a 
year-and-a-half-old, I should say—and I 
look forward to being able to enjoy 
these incredible public lands with her 
over the many coming years. 
So at the end of the day this bill 
makes sense. It is worth fighting for. 
Let’s protect public lands, not just in 
Colorado but across the country. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support the Protecting America’s 
Wilderness Act. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Chairman, it was alluded to once, 
but I want to underscore that passage 
of this would add massive new burdens 
on Federal agencies. We need to be 
using those resources to better manage 
what we have already got as public 
land and public resources. 
As a reminder, we are $2.3 billion in 
debt. What that means is the Federal 
Government is way over its head. We 
can’t afford to manage land, and we 
can’t afford to take care of it. 
So guess what? 
It doesn’t do it. Then we all pay, 
typically, when things go on fire. 
Mr. Chairman, in my State of Idaho, 
because of all that massive amount of 
Federal land, we are really more like 
tenants than we are landlords. But to 
make an analogy, our landlord can’t af-
ford to fix a broken roof. That is what 
we have got with responsibility on 
these government agencies unable to 
take care of these resources. 
Mr. Chairman, you have heard testi-
mony from my colleagues that many of 
the local communities impacted have 
raised significant concerns ranging 
from loss of access, recreation, elimi-
nation of constructive and wise man-
agement, and threats to rural econo-
mies. In addition to the concerns and 
opposition raised by local stakeholders 
and counties, some of the provisions in 
the package are opposed by the actual 
Members who represent the areas af-
fected. It is troubling. 
This effort is also funded in part by 
some special interest groups, and they 
sometimes will call themselves envi-
ronmentalists. To those people, I just 
want to communicate: I live in this 
area. All too often you don’t. We are 
the real environmentalists because we 
take care of a fabulous resource. 
Public lands decisions should be 
made with local collaboration and 
input. This set of bills does not do it. 
They have real consequences on real 
people. Sound, proven, and scientific 
management are critical. 
Mr. Chairman, God gave us a fabu-
lous resource here, but he also gave us 
a brain. We need to use our brain. 
Now, I am not naive. I know my col-
leagues across the aisle have got to 
vote for this thing. Part of that is that 
some people’s DNA says that wilder-
ness is good and human involvement is 
bad. 
I would just close by saying this: 
Facts are stubborn things. The first 
fact is this set of bills is going no-
where.

The second fact is wise manage-
ment—that is using our mind—is much 
better than stagnating this resource. 
Fact number three is when this 
stalls—and it will—those of us on this 
side of the aisle and those of us who 
live in the West will still be here ask-
ing for your cooperation in working 
with us. 
Mr. Chairman, please don’t let pride 
blind you. Work with us on putting 
some intelligence and some wisdom 
into managing this resource. 
Mr. Chairman, I include in the 
RECORD a Statement of Administration 
Policy recommending a veto of this bill 
package. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 2546—PROTECTING AMERICA’S WILDERNESS 
ACT—REP. DEGETTE, D-CO, AND REP. NEGUSE, 
D-CO 
The Administration opposes H.R. 2546. This 
bill would impose unnecessary and harmful 
restrictions on more than 2.5 million acres of 
land in Colorado, California, and Washington 
State, including nearly 1.5 million acres in 
the form of wilderness designations. These 
restrictions will greatly reduce opportuni-
ties for multiple uses on these public lands, 
limit access to them, and significantly re-
duce the available productive acreage in 
working forests, rendering them more prone 
to catastrophic wildfires. 
The Administration has expanded access to 
America’s public lands; increased hunting, 
fishing, and recreational opportunities na-
tionwide; and enhanced conservation stew-
ardship of our vast natural resources. With 
regard to the designation of wilderness on 
public lands, the Administration generally 
supports congressional action to resolve wil-
derness designation and Wilderness Study 
Areas (WSA) release issues, particularly for 
WSAs that were established more than 30 
years ago. Many WSAs were recommended 
for designation, while others were rec-
ommended as not suitable, with suggestions 
that they be returned to agency manage-
ment to integrate their other intrinsic val-
ues 
into 
surrounding 
land 
management 
plans. The Administration recommends ad-
dressing these long overdue WSA decisions 
before undertaking potential designations of 
new areas that did not meet the criteria es-
tablished in the 1964 Wilderness Act when in-
ventories were completed many years ago. 
The Administration strongly believes that 
before new or potential wilderness areas or 
wild and scenic rivers are designated, it is 
important to first ensure that such designa-
tion is the most appropriate land manage-
ment tool for a given parcel. For this and 
other reasons, successful conservation pro-
posals that have incorporated this tool over 
the last decade have been more limited in ge-
ographic scope than this bill. It is important 
to ensure that designating new wilderness 
areas on public lands does not unnecessarily 
impede public access, limit outdoor rec-
reational opportunities, or conflict with pre- 
existing uses. Unfortunately, a number of 
the proposals for wilderness designations in 
H.R. 2546 fail to follow this successful model. 
While many recreational activities, such 
as hunting, fishing, and hiking, are compat-
ible with wilderness designation, other ac-
tivities, such as mountain biking and off- 
highway vehicle use, are not. Some of the 
areas proposed for wilderness designation in 
H.R. 2546 contain popular motorized or 
mechanized recreation areas. In addition, ex-
isting energy development poses inherent 
challenges for wilderness designations, cre-
ating complex management issues pertaining 
to active mining claims and oil and gas 
leases within a designated wilderness area. 
The designations under this bill could im-
pede future energy and mineral development, 
including development that is important to 
the economic and national security of the 
United States. 
The Administration is committed to man-
aging public lands as a good neighbor to the 
local communities and to the Americans who 
live and work in close proximity to them. 
Engaging local stakeholders and considering 
their on-the-ground expertise are critical 
steps in making decisions about public lands 
management, and local communities have 
concerns that many aspects of H.R. 2546 
would produce negative effects for their citi-
zens and their economies. 
The Administration is willing to work with 
Congress to make the necessary improve-
ments to this bill if it is considered further. 
If H.R. 2546 were presented to the President 
in its current form, however, his advisors 
would recommend that he veto it. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BROWNLEY). 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. 
Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman 
for bringing this important public 
lands bill to the floor. 
H.R. 2546 incorporates a bill I helped 
introduce along with Representative 
CARBAJAL, the Central Coast Heritage 
Protection Act. 
The Central Coast Heritage Protec-
tion Act sets aside more than 40,000 
acres in the Los Padres National For-
est as wilderness. It also designates the 
Condor Trail within Los Padres as a 
National Recreation Trail. Both of 
these actions have long been priorities 
of my constituents, and so I am pleased 
the House is taking action on them 
today. 
We in Ventura County are so fortu-
nate to be surrounded by gorgeous pub-
lic spaces, including the Los Padres 
National 
Forest. 
Designating 
these 
lands as wilderness will strengthen en-
vironmental protections in our region 
and preserve this important part of our 
natural heritage for future generations 
to enjoy. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentle-
woman, again, for bringing this bill 
forward. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from the 
State of Washington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
my good friend and colleague for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Chairman, as someone who was 
born and raised on the Olympic Penin-
sula, I know firsthand how special our 
region is and how our public lands con-
tribute to the fabric of who we are. 
In our region we understand that pro-
tecting public lands isn’t just about 
saving these unforgettable places for 
future generations. It also means pro-
tecting high quality jobs for the next 
generation as well. 
As someone who worked in economic 
development professionally for over a 
decade, I have seen how our natural re-
sources contribute to our economic vi-
tality. Each year millions of people and 
families travel to my State and con-
tribute roughly $22 billion in economic 
impact and support 200,000 jobs in 
Washington’s outdoor economy. Our 
national treasures have created oppor-
tunities for local entrepreneurs who 
have started restaurants, guided tour 
companies, hotels, and other small 
businesses. 
That is why it makes sense to pro-
tect these special places, and it is why 
I am proud the House is considering 
this comprehensive package which in-
cludes my legislation, the Wild Olym-
pics Wilderness and Wild and Scenic 
Rivers Act. This bill protects some of 
our environmentally sensitive areas by 
establishing a new wilderness area to 
protect the last remaining old-growth 
stands on the peninsula and desig-
nating 19 rivers and tributaries as wild 
and scenic rivers to protect critical 
salmon spawning habitat. 
This proposal has evolved through 
extensive 
public 
engagement 
with 
Tribes, conservation groups, timber 
communities, business leaders, shell-
fish growers, and everyone in between 
to create a bill that works for our local 
communities. 
It is because of that extensive public 
outreach that this bill is formally now 
supported by more than 800 community 
leaders—Republicans, Democrats, busi-
ness owners, sportsmen, mayors, coun-
ty commissioners, and Tribal leaders— 
all of whom agree that this proposal 
moves our region in the right direc-
tion. 
In addition to protecting recreational 
access and supporting our outdoor 
economy, this bill will also bolster our 
region’s efforts to protect sources of 
clean drinking water, support critical 
salmon and steelhead habitat, and pro-
tect key waterways that are vital to 
our shellfish industry. 
But just as important as these things 
are the things this bill will not do. 
This proposal will not close, decom-
mission, or otherwise restrict access to 
any existing Forest Service roads or 
trailheads. 
It will not impact any harvestable 
timber base in the Olympic National 
Forest, and I am doing a whole bunch 
of work to actually increase harvest 
through other avenues. 
This bill will not affect any private 
property rights, and it will not impact 
how the Washington Department of 
Natural 
Resources 
manages 
State- 
owned land, which is why it has gained 
the endorsement of the Washington 
Commissioner of Public Lands. 
We know that our region’s future de-
pends on building a strong and diversi-
fied economy. And after years of col-
laboration, I think this bill we are con-
sidering today represents a clear win- 
win for the communities I represent. 
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the 
senior Senator from Washington, Sen-
ator MURRAY, for her partnership on 
this effort, and I encourage my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this impor-
tant legislation. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1066 
February 12, 2020 
Mr. Chairman, wilderness is not 
owned by me, it is not owned by any 
Member on the other side of the aisle, 
and it is not owned by any Members of 
Congress. It is owned by the people. It 
is owned by the people of this country 
and future generations of this country. 
That is why we are the stewards of this 
wilderness. 
These are Federal lands, and I have 
heard some of my colleagues on the 
other side in this debate say: Well, 
some county commissioner doesn’t sup-
port it; some Member doesn’t support 
it. 
It doesn’t matter. These Federal 
lands belong to the public. In fact, last 
October in Colorado there was a poll 
done of the areas that are impacted in 
my portion of the wilderness bill. This 
poll found that 71 percent of the people 
in the affected areas—the citizens, the 
people who use this land for economic 
development and recreation—believe 
that 
these 
wilderness 
study 
areas 
should be made permanent and that 
they should be made into wilderness. 
That is whom I believe. 
I want to tell you one more story, 
Mr. Chairman, and that is the story 
about in August when I went down to 
Cortez, Colorado, near three of the wil-
derness areas in my bill. One of the 
county commissioners, Mr. Ertel, testi-
fied in Congress that he represents that 
area. 
Do you know something? 
In Cortez, Colorado, the city council 
and the mayor support the bill. At a 
townhall meeting I had, there were 75 
people. Sixty-five of them raised their 
hands when I asked if they supported 
the bill. That is who supports this bill, 
that is who this is for, and that is 
whom we need to think about and lis-
ten to as we pass this legislation. 
The areas in this bill all have strong 
wilderness characteristics, and we owe 
it to our children, to our grand-
children, 
and 
to 
our 
great-grand-
children to take bold action right now 
and preserve them. 
I just want to take a minute and 
thank everybody who has been in-
volved with this bill: obviously, the 
chairman of the committee, Mr. GRI-
JALVA, his staff, Chris Rackens, Bran-
don Bragato, Henry Wykowski, Cam-
eron Walkup, and Lily Wang; and my 
staff who have worked on this bill for 
over 20 years now, Lisa Cohen, my 
Chief of Staff; Kaila Hood, Matt Allen, 
Tom Woodburn, and Marc Rehmann, 
all of whom have worked their guts out 
for this, as well as many other staffers 
past and present. 
Finally, I want to thank the citizens 
who brought this bill to me to begin 
with and who continue to work their 
hearts out every day to preserve our 
wild 
places; 
in 
particular, 
John 
Stansfield of Wild Connections who 
can’t be with us today, and Mark Pear-
son of San Juan Wilderness—who the 
last time I saw him, he was sitting on 
a cliff high up in one of my wilderness 
areas and is now sitting in the gallery 
watching us pass this historic legisla-
tion. 
It truly is a labor of love, and I look 
forward to telling my grandchildren 
about this historic day. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
All time for general debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 
5-minute rule. 
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on Natural Resources, 
printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of 
the text of Rules Committee Print 116– 
50, shall be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be consid-
ered as the original bill for the purpose 
of 
further 
amendment 
under 
the

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS. DEGETTE 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
House Report 116–395. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 10, lines 18 and 19, strike ‘‘ ‘Cross Can-
yon Proposed Wilderness’, dated October 9, 
2019’’ and insert ‘‘ ‘Papoose & Cross Canyon

4,782 acres, as generally depicted on the map 
titled ‘‘Papoose & Cross Canyon Proposed 
Wilderness’ ’’’, and dated January 29, 2020 
which shall be known as the Papoose Canyon 
Wilderness. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Colorado. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, the amend-
ment I offer today adds four additional 
unique wilderness areas to the State of 
Colorado, totaling more than 60,000 
acres to our bill, the Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness Act. 
The addition of these areas stems 
from extensive conversations I had 
with local stakeholders, Tribes, and 
outdoor recreation groups. 
The first one is Diamond Breaks, a 
wilderness study area in northwest Col-
orado that is attached to our State’s 
beloved Dinosaur National Monument. 
This area was recommended for wilder-
ness designation by the Bureau of Land 
Management under George H.W. Bush. 
It is a favorite among the many 
rafters, kayakers, and canoers who 
visit the national monument every 
year, and preserving it has been a pri-
ority for many conservation groups in 
my State. 
Protecting this land will help provide 
economic security for an area of the 
State that depends heavily on our out-
door recreation economy. 
The amendment also further protects 
Papoose Canyon, another wilderness 
study area in southwest Colorado, near 
Cross Canyon, which is the area I men-
tioned that I visited last August. 
Papoose Canyon has been a wilder-
ness study area since 1980. It lies with-
in the Canyon of the Ancients National 
Monument and, with an estimated 100 
ancestral Puebloan sites per square 
mile, has significant cultural value. By 
officially designating this area as fed-
erally protected wilderness, we will 
permanently preserve this sacred land 
for generations to come. 
Finally, Mr. Chairman, this amend-
ment protects north and south Pon-
derosa Gorge, which is often referred to 
as the Southwest Secret of Colorado. 
According to the Bureau of Land Man-
agement, nearly 13,000 visitors come to 
this region every month during its 
peak season. It is a favorite among 
those looking to launch their non-
motorized boats on the Dolores River 
or backpack into the Chemehuevi 
Mountains. Protecting this land has 
also been a priority for conservation-
ists in Colorado for decades. 
While each of these areas that would 
be protected under this amendment is 
unique, they are some of the most in-
credible wilderness that our State has 
to offer. Countless Coloradans, when 
they found that this bill was coming 
forward, came and asked me to include 
these three unique areas in the legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues will 
honor their request and accept this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I do rise 
in opposition to the amendment before 
us. 
Apparently, the bill that is before us 
today didn’t include enough wilderness 
in my district. As we see in this 
amendment, we are now trying to be 
able to add more. 
The amendment adds an additional 
60,000 acres of wilderness in Colorado. 
One proposed addition that is particu-
larly concerning, because it has local 
opposition, is the Papoose Canyon. 
Montezuma and Dolores Counties op-
pose the wilderness designation of Pa-
poose Canyon. 
The wilderness study area falls with-
in the Canyons of the Ancients Na-
tional Monument, which I have worked 
to preserve. The land already has strict 
Federal protections so wilderness des-
ignation is not necessary. 
Mr. Chairman, again, the BLM has 
studied these lands and found them to 
be unsuitable for wilderness. Monte-
zuma and Dolores Counties have re-
quested the Papoose Canyon Wilder-
ness Study Area be released because 
the canyon is surrounded by private 
land, which has created challenges 
when it comes to wildfire prevention. 
Papoose Canyon Wilderness was not 
originally in my colleague’s bill. In-
stead of consulting the counties that 
would be impacted by the addition and 
considering their objections, we are 
here debating a last-minute amend-
ment. 
Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, 
and I would encourage my colleagues 
who believe that local voices must be a 
part of any land management decision 
to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a 
letter from a coalition of groups—the 
San Juan Citizens Alliance, the Sierra 
Club, the Sheep Mountain Alliance, the 
Conservatives for Responsible Steward-
ship, and the Western Colorado Alli-
ance—urging me to include these areas 
in the bill. 
FEBRUARY 4, 2020. 
Hon. DIANA DEGETTE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REP. DEGETTE: Thank you for the op-
portunity to provide feedback on the Colo-
rado Wilderness Act, HR 2546. We appreciate 
your relentless leadership in pursuit of pro-
tecting Colorado’s BLM wild lands. 
It’s worth recalling that your original pro-
posal first introduced in 1999 encompassed 49 
areas and almost 1.4 million acres, and was 
the result of field work completed by con-
servationists over the prior 20 years. The 
Colorado Wilderness Act has evolved over 
time, and most recently includes about 30 
areas with a little over 600,000 acres. 
There are several areas we wanted to high-
light as HR 2546 moves towards consider-
ation by the House of Representatives. One 
area consistently included in every version 
of the bill since 1999 is Snaggletooth, an area 
that encompasses the spectacular ponderosa 
gorge 
of 
the 
Dolores 
River 
Canyon. 
Snaggletooth was removed from the bill dur-
ing consideration by the House Natural Re-
sources Committee, but we believe that with 
some modest boundary adjustments and 
clarifications about nearby rights-of-way 
corridors that Snaggletooth can be reincor-
porated into the legislation. It is without

doubt one of the BLM’s crown jewels in Colo-
rado. 
Papoose Canyon is one of three wilderness 
study areas in Canyons of the Ancients Na-
tional Monument. It was included in the Col-
orado Wilderness Act through 2007, but then 
inexplicably omitted from subsequent bills. 
Papoose is adjacent to Cross Canyon, and 
provides added protection for some of the 
richest cultural resource concentrations in 
the Southwest. Like Cross Canyon, it is out-
side the McElmo Dome carbon dioxide re-
serves and is unlikely to provide any conflict 
with energy minerals. We encourage your in-
clusion of Papoose Canyon WSA in the Colo-
rado Wilderness Act as the other WSAs in 
Canyons of the Ancients National Monument 
are already in the bill. 
While we might hope that National Monu-
ment designation provided a level of con-
servation certainty, in the past few years we 
have observed that an Administration hos-
tile to the Antiquities Act could well pursue 
actions to undermine or eliminate the Na-
tional Monument status of Canyons of the 
Ancients. Wilderness designation is a con-
gressional action that cannot be overturned 
at the whim of the executive branch and is 
the tried and true approach to guaranteeing 
the wildlands resources, wildlife habitat, and 
undisturbed cultural resources of Papoose 
Canyon will be preserved into the future. 
In 2009, you deferred to an effort by BLM to 
undertake re-evaluation of wilderness can-
didate areas in northwest Colorado, includ-
ing a number of areas surrounding Dinosaur 
National Monument that BLM had long rec-
ognized for their wilderness values, and re-
moved those areas from the Colorado Wilder-
ness Act. Unfortunately, once BLM’s unsuc-
cessful wilderness re-inventory concluded, 
these areas from northwest Colorado that 
had previously been included within every 
version of the Colorado Wilderness Act from 
1999 through 2007 were not reincorporated 
into the legislation. We encourage you to re-
visit the status of these areas and consider 
adding them back into the Colorado Wilder-
ness Act. These include one of the largest 
Wilderness Study Areas in Colorado, Dia-
mond Breaks, which is bounded both by Di-
nosaur National Monument and Browns Park 
National Wildlife Refuge. Additional wilder-
ness quality lands surround Dinosaur Na-
tional Monument, and include the stunning 
Yampa River gorge through Cross Mountain, 
sandstone canyons across the southern ap-
proaches to the Monument, and extraor-
dinary wildlife habitat on Cold Spring Moun-
tain. 
Diamond Breaks straddles the Colorado- 
Utah border. For many years, America’s Red 
Rock Wilderness legislation has been pend-
ing that includes the Utah portion of Dia-
mond Breaks. Most recently, America’s Red 
Rock Wilderness Act was reintroduced with 
16 cosponsors in the Senate, S. 3056, that 
once again includes wilderness designation 
for the Utah portion of Diamond Breaks. In 
2017, a companion House bill was introduced, 
HR 2044, cosponsored by 123 members of the 
House and similarly included wilderness des-
ignation for Diamond Breaks in Utah. Pair-
ing Colorado legislation that completes des-
ignation for the Colorado portion of Dia-
mond Breaks makes obvious sense. 
We are hopeful the Colorado Wilderness 
Act, HR 2546 will be favorably approved by 
the House. We look forward to working with 
your office and Senate colleagues to further 
refine the Colorado Wilderness Act and see it 
successfully enacted into law.

Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, these areas 
have all been protected for years. Two 
of them have already been wilderness 
study areas, and as I mentioned, they 
are in the area of the State where there 
is widespread public support and where 
they also are great economic drivers. 
They are appropriately contained in 
this bill. 
As I said, when these groups found 
out that this bill was moving along, 
they urged me to include these really 
important historical and recreational 
areas in the bill. 
Mr. Chair, one last thing: I forgot to 
thank Steve Bonowski, who is with 
Conservatives for Responsible Steward-
ship. He has been a real partner with us 
throughout, making the conservative 
argument of why we need to protect 
wilderness. 
Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I do appreciate the com-
ments. Here is the reality: In the Can-
yon of the Ancients in the area that I 
am speaking to, these are already pro-
tected lands. The BLM, when we are 
talking about a wilderness study area, 
has stated that these do not qualify as 
wilderness. 
When we look at our county commis-
sioners, they are going to be the ones 
in our remote rural areas who are 
going to be responsible for dealing with 
the potential of wildfire, which is 
something that all Coloradans ought to 
be well concerned about. 
Without their support, with recogni-
tion that this land is protected, and 
with the BLM stating that this does 
not qualify as a wilderness area, I 
would encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on this amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Ms.

The question was taken; and the Act-

peared to have it. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I demand a 
recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from Colorado will be 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. MCCLINTOCK 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in 
House Report 116–395. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 234, after line 21, insert the following 
(and redesignate subsequent provisions ac-
cordingly): 
TITLE VII—COUNTY APPROVAL OF 
WILDERNESS DESIGNATIONS 
SEC. 701. COUNTY APPROVAL. 
No wilderness designation under this Act 
shall be effective in any county until the 
county formally approves such designation. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, 
the Federal Government owns just 
seven-tenths of 1 percent of the State 
of New York. It owns 1.1 percent of the 
State of Illinois. It owns just 1.8 per-
cent of the entire State of Texas. In 
fact, the Federal Government only 
owns one-fourth of Washington, D.C. 
But then go farther west, and you 
will see the problem. The Federal Gov-
ernment owns and controls 62 percent 
of the State of Alaska, two-thirds of 
Utah, and four-fifths of the State of 
Nevada. It owns nearly half of my 
home State of California. In one coun-
ty in my district, Alpine County, the 
Federal Government owns 96 percent. 
People from the East have no idea 
what that means. That is all lands that 
is off the local tax rolls. That is all 
land that carries increasingly severe 
restrictions on public use and access, 
which means it is generating very lit-
tle economic activity for those regions. 
Often, Federal ownership means the 
Federal land-use policies are in direct 
contravention to the wishes of the 
local communities that are entangled 
with it. 
Now, when we Republicans held the 
majority, one of our Federal lands ob-
jectives was to restore the Federal 
Government as a good neighbor to 
those communities directly impacted 
by the Federal lands. The bill before us 
does exactly the opposite. This bill 
adds 11⁄2 million acres of Federal land 
to wilderness restrictions, meaning you 
can’t even bring a stroller on these 
lands. 
This land grab is strongly opposed by 
the local communities it would di-
rectly affect. The Mesa County com-
mission and Garfield County, Colorado, 
oppose this bill because of concerns it 
will further restrict public access and 
increase the risk of fire. The Congress-
man representing those areas opposes 
the legislation. 
Mr. Chair, 80 percent of Del Norte 
County in California is already owned 
by the State and Federal Governments,

and their board of supervisors is pro-
testing the further restriction of public 
access to these lands, noting that these 
lands don’t even meet wilderness cri-
teria. 
Trinity County has also formally op-
posed the bill, yet we are plowing 
ahead anyway. The Monrovia City 
Council protests the enormous eco-
nomic burdens this bill would place on 
their city. So, too, the Grays Harbor 
County Commission and the city coun-
cils of Aberdeen and Cosmopolis in 
Washington State beg us not to impose 
these restrictions on their commu-
nities, and I could go on. 
Representing the Sierra Nevada of 
California, I can tell you there are no 
more fierce or knowledgeable guard-
ians of our forests than the people who 
live among them. My amendment sim-
ply restores the good neighbor policy 
the Republicans practiced for many 
years. It simply provides that wilder-
ness restrictions cannot be imposed 
until the county on which the land is 
located approves of them. 
Mr. Chair, I would ask my Demo-
cratic colleagues to show a little hu-
mility and a little mercy in exercising 
their power by listening to the people 
most affected by their decisions and 
adopt this amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I am so 
glad the author of this amendment has 
asked us to listen to the people who 
this affects because we have. 
That is why we found out that 71 per-
cent of the people in the affected areas, 
the citizens, support this legislation. 
That is why when I went to Cortez, 
Colorado, and had a townhall and there 
were 75 people there, 65 of them said 
they were in support of the wilderness 
areas. 
We shouldn’t allow one or two local 
elected officials, or even Members of 
Congress, to have veto power over pres-
ervation of Federal lands for future 
generations. 
If this amendment were adopted and 
the bill enacted, local governments 
would be able to indefinitely delay a 
Federal land designation approved by 
the House, the Senate, and signed into 
law by the President. 
Wilderness designation, which is the 
highest level of protection that we be-
stow, is solely at the discretion of Con-
gress and has been so since the original 
Wilderness Act. It is intended to pro-
vide permanent protection for excep-
tional landscapes, and it is a key tool 
for preserving undisturbed lands. 
So what are we going to do? Are we 
going to be at the whim of local elec-
tions to decide who should support it? 
And who decides? Why do the county 
commissioners get veto power? What 
about the mayors and city councils? 
While the Montezuma County com-
missioners may oppose the designation 
of the wilderness study areas, the Cor-
tez City Council and the mayor support 
it. 
That is why we have to hear what the 
people have to say. No individual elect-
ed official, from a commissioner to a 
Member of Congress, should have the 
ability 
to 
unilaterally 
veto 
these 
things. 
All the areas included in all the titles 
of this bill are the result of multiyear 
collaborative efforts between bill spon-
sors and stakeholders on the ground. 
We have to remember that these 
lands are publicly owned. They are not 
privately owned. They belong to every 
American and future generations. 
Frankly, I think that, as Members of 
Congress, we have the responsibility to 
listen to our constituents and to listen 
to the people of the United States, and 
the people of the United States want to 
preserve the very few special remain-
ing wild places that we have. 
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I 
would simply ask the gentlewoman, if 
it is true that local people affected by 
this bill actually support it, then what 
does she have to fear from getting their 
approval? 
Her 
opposition 
to 
this 
amendment puts the lie to her claim 
that the local people support it and 
tells us she doesn’t believe her own 
rhetoric. 
Gifford Pinchot, the father of the 
U.S. Forest Service, propounded max-
ims for good behavior by foresters. He 
said, among other things: 
A public official is there to serve the pub-
lic and not run them. 
Public support of acts affecting public 
rights is absolutely required. 
It is more trouble to consult the public 
than to ignore them, but that is what you 
were hired to do. 
Get rid of an attitude of personal arro-
gance or pride of attainment of superior 
knowledge. 
Mr. Chairman, this bill turns these 
maxims upside down. 
b 1345 
It says to local residents: We know 
what’s best for you and your commu-
nities; your opinions are unimportant 
to us, your wishes are irrelevant, and 
your voices are unheard. We’re in 
charge and we’ll damn well do as we 
please. 
I ask my Democratic colleagues to 
step back and consider how you would 
react to a government that takes such 
an attitude as that. 
My amendment simply asks the peo-
ple and trusts the people. If we are still 
a government of, by, and for the peo-
ple, that is the least we can do. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-

TOCK). 
The question was taken; and the Act-

Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote.

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MR. MCCLINTOCK 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in 
House Report 116–395. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 234, after line 21, insert the following 
(and redesignate subsequent provisions ac-
cordingly): 
TITLE 
VII—PRESERVING 
WILDERNESS 
CHARACTER AND WILD AND SCENIC 
RIVER CHARACTER 
SEC. 701. PRESERVING WILDERNESS AND WILD 
AND SCENIC RIVER CHARACTER. 
(a) WILDERNESS.—The Secretary of Agri-
culture or the Secretary of the Interior, as 
appropriate, may exempt from any wilder-
ness designated under this Act any area de-
termined by that Secretary not to meet the 
definition of wilderness under the Wilderness 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.). 
(b) WILD
AND
SCENIC
RIVERS.—The Sec-
retary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the 
Interior, as appropriate, may exempt from 
any wild and scenic river designated by an 
amendment in this Act any area determined 
by that Secretary not to meet the qualifica-
tions for a wild, scenic, or recreational river 
under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 
U.S.C. 1271 et seq.). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, 
when the Wilderness Act was adopted 
in 1964, it designated about 9 million 
acres; that is a little larger than the 
State of Maryland. Over the years, that 
has ballooned to 111 million acres, a 
land area the size of California. This 
bill adds 11⁄2 million acres more. That is 
the size of Delaware and half of Rhode 
Island combined. 
The restrictions in the wilderness 
areas are severe. You can’t bring a bi-
cycle on these lands. You can’t drive to 
a campsite. 
The Wilderness Act provides for wil-
derness designation only for those 
lands that are—and listen to this care-
fully—‘‘an area where the Earth and 
community of life are untrammeled by 
man, where man himself is a visitor 
who does not remain’’ and ‘‘an area of 
underdeveloped Federal land retaining 
its primeval character and influence, 
without permanent improvements or 
human habitation, which is protected 
and managed so as to preserve its nat-
ural conditions.’’ 
Well, much of the land in this bill 
doesn’t begin to meet these criteria. 
The Department of the Interior, and 
the local communities directly affected 
by this bill, are warning us that this

new Federal land grab includes acreage 
on which there are buildings and roads, 
grazing and off-road vehicle trails, bi-
cycle trails, communication towers, 
small businesses, mines and oil wells. 
Moreover, motorized and mechanized 
firefighting and fire suppression equip-
ment is currently allowed on these 
lands but would be severely restricted 
if the land is designated as wilderness. 
All you can use in a wilderness area, 
without special permission, is a hand-
saw, a shovel, and an axe to fight a 
fire. 
To include such acreage under the 
Wilderness Act makes a mockery of its 
original intent and poses a direct 
threat to the tourism, livelihoods, jobs, 
safety, and quality of life of the com-
munities adjacent to them. 
Abraham Lincoln once told of the 
farmer who said: ‘‘I ain’t greedy for 
land. All I want is what’s next to 
mine.’’ That appears to be the new 
motto of the Democrats, and it is hav-
ing a devastating impact on our moun-
tain and rural communities. 
The amendment I offer simply pro-
vides that the relevant Department 
Secretary, either Agriculture or Inte-
rior, can exempt those lands contained 
in this bill that do not meet the legal 
requirements of the Wilderness Act or 
the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, restor-
ing the original intent of these laws. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. 
DEGETTE. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
claim the time in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. 
DEGETTE. 
Mr. 
Chair, 
this 
amendment, just like the prior amend-
ment, is another attempt to cede con-
gressional responsibility. 
I can assure the gentleman that 
every piece of land in this bill that is 
designated as wilderness is, in fact, wil-
derness. The gentleman is right; in the 
statutory definition of wilderness there 
is no mechanized or motorized equip-
ment. There is no mining or drilling. I 
will say, for firefighting, you don’t just 
have to use shovels; you can use other 
things. 
But, be that as it may, wilderness 
should be reserved for those very few 
special areas that are untrammeled by 
man, just like the Wilderness Act says. 
I will also guarantee, Mr. Chair, that 
every acre that is designated wilder-
ness has been gone over by the spon-
sors, by the citizens, by the activists, 
and it qualifies as wilderness. 
In the Colorado Wilderness Act, two- 
thirds of the areas have been managed 
as wilderness because they are wilder-
ness study areas, and they have been 
managed as wilderness for over 30 
years; so these areas are wilderness. 
Why, then, would I object to this 
amendment? Because what it does is it 
cedes Congress’ powers to the executive 
branch. And, frankly, with this admin-
istration, that is the last thing I think 
we should do in deciding what wilder-
ness is. 
If this amendment were adopted and 
the bill was enacted, Secretary Bern-
hardt would be unilaterally empowered 
to veto designations of wilderness en-
acted by Congress and signed by the 
President. 
This amendment would give unprece-
dented and problematic power to the 
Secretary to override Congress, based 
on no criteria, other than what they 
wanted to do. 
Now, if my colleagues had questions 
about if these areas are worthy of des-
ignation, they only have to look at the 
bill reports, where we extensively docu-
mented the outstanding values of the 
public lands and rivers included in this 
bill. 
Now, I would just challenge the gen-
tleman to tell me which of the wilder-
ness designations in this legislation do 
not meet wilderness criteria, because it 
is for Congress to make that decision, 
not the executive branch. And we need 
to retain our Article I power every day 
and in every way. 
For that reason, I oppose this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, 
once again, I would ask the gentle-
woman that if what she says is true, 
that the lands in this bill meet the 
legal requirements, she has nothing to 
fear from my amendment. Only where 
the land does not meet legal require-
ments can a Secretary exempt it. 
One of the objectives we had set when 
we were in the majority was to restore 
public access to the public lands. These 
lands are set aside for the use, enjoy-
ment, and recreation of the American 
people for all time. And that includes a 
wide range of activities, most of which 
are prohibited under wilderness or wild 
and scenic rivers designation. Such se-
vere 
restrictions 
on 
public 
access 
should be used very carefully and spar-
ingly. 
My amendment simply says: That 
the lands affected by this bill must 
meet the legal definitions contained in 
the Wilderness Act and the Wild and 
Scenic Rivers Act. It doesn’t modify 
those acts; it affirms them. 
The despots of Great Britain early on 
set aside a third of the countryside as 
the ‘‘King’s royal forests,’’ the private 
preserves of the royal court and their 
hangers-on. Commoners were severely 
restricted from these lands under dra-
conian penalties. They were so re-
sented by the British people that no 
fewer than five clauses in the Magna 
Carta were devoted to redressing these 
grievances. 
The American public lands were sup-
posed to be exactly the opposite of the 
King’s forests. These are lands set 
aside for the common enjoyment of the 
American people in all the many and 
varied outdoor activities and pursuits 
that they cherish. 
By ignoring the legal definitions of 
the Wilderness and Wild and Scenic 
Rivers Acts and scooping up and put-
ting off-limits to most activities vast 
tracts of land held by and for the pub-
lic, the Democrats make a mockery of 
these laws and undermine public sup-
port for them. 
We have heard a lot recently that no 
one is above the law. Well, that in-
cludes 
Congress. 
This 
amendment 
assures that the lands affected by this 
bill meet the criteria of the original 
laws that they invoke. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I do 
agree that wilderness is reserved for 
those very special few areas that are 
left that truly are wild. 
I challenged the gentleman to tell me 
which area, which acre in this bill does 
not meet the Wilderness Act criteria, 
and he did not do so. And that is be-
cause every acre of wilderness that my 
cosponsors and I have designated meets 
that criteria. It has been vetted, and it 
is one of those very few pristine areas 
that we should protect. 
By the way, in Colorado, even if this 
bill is adopted, still, only less than 10 
percent of our land will be wilderness 
and as it should be, because wilderness 
should be protected as a wild area. 
I will say, though, that is not what 
this 
amendment 
does. 
What 
this 
amendment does is it cedes determina-
tion of what is wilderness from the 
Congress, which should be determining 
this, to the administration, another 
erosion of an Article I power. That is 
why I oppose this amendment, and I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-

from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I thank Chairman GRIJALVA and Con-
gresswoman DEGETTE
for their hard 
work on this bill. 
Our public lands are iconic features 
of the American landscape. It is our 
duty to preserve and protect these 
treasured lands, and to be responsible 
stewards so that future generations 
can enjoy them as much as we do 
today. 
The Protecting America’s Wilderness 
Act recognizes the irreplaceable value 
of public lands in our lives by safe-
guarding 
public 
lands 
and 
waters 
across Colorado, California, and Wash-
ington. 
But the value of these lands goes far 
beyond their vast ecological diversity. 
They offer our veterans a unique oppor-
tunity to heal after they return home 
from the frontlines. 
My amendment strengthens this bill 
by promoting the health and wellness 
of our veterans and servicemembers 
through access to lands protected with-
in this bill, outdoor recreation, and 
participation in volunteer programs. 
The 
great 
American outdoors is 
uniquely positioned to provide thera-
peutic benefits to our veterans and 
brave men and women in service. As 
they transition from service, or a uni-
form, to civilian life, public lands have 
been shown to help them reconnect, re-
cover, and heal. 
We make a sacred promise to every 
veteran, and it is our duty to serve 
them as they have served us and ensure 
that they can actively benefit from all 
that our landscapes have to offer. By 
doing so, we honor not only the impor-
tance of these lands, but also those 
who continue to serve this country 
today. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this amendment and the underlying 
bill. 
Mr. FULCHER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Idaho 
(Mr. 
FULCHER), the minority manager. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I just 
want to make a comment. We haven’t 
been shy so far today over here on 
criticizing where we see issues. I just 
wanted to communicate with the gen-
tleman that, in this case, I also want 
to point out the positive things. 
I support the gentleman’s amend-
ment, and I commend him for bringing 
that forward. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I just want to say thank you to 
the gentleman and all the Members of 
Congress who, not only during the 
course of this bill and the amendments 
and the debate but as a tradition, in a 
bipartisan manner are supporting our 
men and women in uniform, those who 
have worn the uniform, and our vet-
erans and their families. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN).

AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. PANETTA 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 5 printed in 
House Report 116–395. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill insert the following: 
TITLE VIII—MISCELLANEOUS 
SEC. 801. FIRE, INSECTS, AND DISEASES. 
Nothing in this Act may be construed to 
limit the authority of the Secretary of the 
Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture 
under section 4(d)(1) of the Wilderness Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(1)), in accordance with ex-
isting laws (including regulations). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. PANETTA) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
offer an amendment today to H.R. 2546, 
Protecting America’s Wilderness Act. 
As we know, this bill would provide 
permanent protections for approxi-
mately 1.3 million acres of Federal 
land, including in California, and 1,200 
miles of rivers. Not only will it provide 
vital protections for some of our most 
precious natural resources, but it will 
also improve outdoor recreational op-
portunities for underserved commu-
nities. 
Now, my amendment ensures that, as 
we work to protect, conserve, and 
enjoy Federal public lands, we also 
prioritize the safety of our commu-
nities. This amendment gives the au-
thority to the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the Secretary 
of the Department of Agriculture to 
ensure that they are able to manage 
for fire, insects, and disease in wilder-
ness areas, particularly during times of 
crisis. 
In California, we are, unfortunately, 
no stranger to the threat of wildfires; 
and with climate change, wildfire sea-
sons are becoming wildfire years. 
Now, wildfires do not stop at prop-
erty lines, so neither should our Fed-
eral efforts to fight wildfires and better 
manage our forestland. As we work to 
fight the effects of climate change and 
the impacts on our forests, we must 
also take every action that we can to 
protect the families and the homes in 
these vulnerable communities. 
In putting forward new and critical 
protections on land—from the red-
woods to the Los Padres National For-
est, to the San Gabriel Mountains—we 
must ensure our Federal land managers 
have the flexibility that they need to 
take the reasonable and necessary ac-
tions to preemptively address fire, in-
sects, and disease threats to this land. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chair, I claim the 
time in opposition, although I am not 
opposed to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CUELLAR). 
Without objection, the gentleman from 
Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, as 
stated, this amendment allows the Sec-
retary of the Interior or the Secretary 
of Agriculture to manage for fire, in-
sects, or disease the wilderness areas 
designated by this act. Again, I am not 
opposed to that, but I just want to 
point out in real life what really hap-
pens. 
Many wilderness areas are overgrown 
and suffer from insect infestations. We 
have already talked about that. That 
contributes significantly to uncontrol-
lable wildfires that really don’t respect 
manmade boundaries very well. 
In wilderness areas, the reality is 
that fires are allowed to continue, and 
they are only suppressed once they 
leave that wilderness boundary. That is 
a particular bummer for wildlife. We 
haven’t talked about what happens in 
those situations, that wildlife is often 
decimated by this type of activity. 
The other thing I just want to point 
out is that mechanized fire mitigation 
tools are banned in wilderness areas for 
anybody, including the Department of 
the 
Interior, 
Department 
of 
Agri-
culture, or the Forest Service. That is 
another thing that is bothersome about 
all of this is that, when we make these 
designations, we throw out the com-
monsense ability to use appropriate 
tools when there are problems. 
Again, we are in support of this 
amendment, but it will do nothing to 
improve the conditions in these wilder-
ness areas. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CARBAJAL), my good friend 
from the southern coast of California. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I thank 
Mr. PANETTA for offering this impor-
tant amendment which further clari-
fies that nothing in this bill would 
hinder any fuels management or fire 
suppression activities on our public 
lands. 
I represent the central coast of Cali-
fornia, and we have seen our share of 
wildfires. I believe that, if we can take 
preventative measures to address any 
wildfire risks, we should. 
As a former county supervisor for 
Santa Barbara County, I have experi-
enced firsthand the obstacles and chal-
lenges of balancing red tape and co-
ordinating amongst stakeholders. As a 
supervisor, I helped implement the 
first community wildfire protection 
plan in Santa Barbara County.

I support Representative PANETTA’s 
amendment because it reaffirms that 
this legislation would not interfere 
with any firefighting or fuels manage-

that. Specifically, section 305(b) of my

House Report 116–395. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 234, after line 21, insert the following 
(and redesignate subsequent provisions ac-
cordingly): 
TITLE VII—PROTECTION FROM HIGH RISK 
OF WILDFIRE 
SEC. 701. PROTECTION FROM HIGH RISK OF 
WILDFIRE. 
The Secretary of Agriculture or the Sec-
retary of the Interior, as appropriate, may 
exempt from any wilderness designated 
under this Act any area determined by that 
Secretary to be at high risk for wildfire. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, 
this is a commonsense amendment that 
will help ensure that the lands des-
ignated as wilderness in this package 
are not areas that are at high risk for 
catastrophic wildfire. 
One of the clear flaws of the package 
before us is the apparent arbitrary 
process that was taken in determining 
the areas to designate as wilderness. At 
the July 10 hearing that included the 
bills in today’s package, the BLM and 
Forest Service conveyed findings that 
a significant number of the proposed 
wilderness additions are not suitable to 
be added to the wilderness system. 
It is critically important that wilder-
ness designations are carefully applied 
due to their highly restrictive limita-
tions and to make sure to take into ac-
count existing uses of the land that can 
be limited, including wildfire risk. 
The amount of public lands at high 
risk for catastrophic wildfire is truly 
sobering. Just last year, the chief of 
the Forest Service warned that a bil-
lion acres of land across America are at 
risk of catastrophic wildfire. 
This is especially true in the three 
States addressed in the legislation be-
fore us, all three of which rank in the 
top 10, nationally, for severe threat of 
wildfire: California, number 1; Colo-
rado, number 3; and Washington, num-
ber 6. 
Mr. Chairman, I filed a bill today to 
plant a trillion trees. We can use for-
ests to help mitigate atmospheric car-
bon. When we lock these forests away 
in wilderness areas, we are taking that 
off the table and actually adding to cli-
mate change by putting forests at risk 
of catastrophic wildfires that emit car-
bon. 
This is a commonsense amendment. 
We don’t need to be putting these areas 
into wilderness areas and taking them 
off the table to use in fighting the 
mitigation of carbon. This amendment 
will make sure that we are not un-
wisely designating areas that have 
been identified at high risk of cata-
strophic wildfire. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I claim the 
time in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Unlike the Panetta amendment that 
we 
just 
debated, 
the 
Westerman 
amendment contains no action or man-
agement prescription to address wild-
fire risk on our public lands. Instead, 
the amendment is another attempt by 
my colleagues to override Congress’ 
constitutional responsibility to make 
law and, instead, give political ap-
pointees overly broad and unilateral 
authority to essentially veto an act of 
Congress. 
This amendment contains the false 
narrative that wilderness is a ‘‘no man-
agement’’ designation and that any 
protective designation will inherently 
increase wildfire risk. 
That, in fact, is not true, and it is the 
opposite: Wilderness areas are some of 
our most resilient natural landscapes. 
Wilderness areas are usually far away 
from homes and other developed areas. 
They don’t contain power lines or 
roads, which are major causes of 
human-caused ignitions, as we saw 
with the recent California fires. And if 
a fire does start in a wilderness area, 
these landscapes are best equipped to 
endure those periodic disturbances, 
which can achieve important manage-
ment objectives and enhance habitat 
and ecosystem functions. 
Mr. Chair, here we have got a photo 
provided to me by my colleague, Mr. 
CARBAJAL, which illustrates this point. 
It is the Machesna Wilderness Area 
that is included in this bill. If you look 
at the area for a moment, you can see 
this is not an area that is appropriate 
for logging, but you can also see some 
charred wood from a recent fire. But 
overall, look at how this area has 
regrown and the beautiful flowers that 
bloomed after the fire. This is what a 
resilient landscape looks like, and it is 
what we are protecting in this bill. 
Furthermore, we have said this over 
and over and over, and I can’t stress it 
enough, there is nothing that prevents 
suppression of an active wildfire in a 
wilderness area. And the Wilderness 
Act allows management activities if 
they are necessary to address fire, in-
sects, and diseases, which is referenced 
in no uncertain terms by Mr. PA-
NETTA’s amendment. 
Wildfire, like climate change, is an 
issue that always should be on our 
minds and inherent in our policies, but 
this red herring narrative that wilder-
ness designation inherently increases 
wildfire is just simply not played out. 
I encourage my colleagues not to 
give in to these false assumptions and 
oppose this amendment. I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I 
urge my colleagues to look at the 
science. I urge my colleagues to look 
at the law, look at what wilderness 
area means. It means untrampled by 
man. It means man has a hands-off ap-
proach to it. 
Wilderness areas can be resilient to 
fire if they are designated appro-
priately, but when we have the experts 
at the BLM and the Forest Service say-
ing these lands are not suitable for wil-
derness areas, when these areas are 
close to roads, when they are close to 
homes and property, we are treading on 
dangerous ground here. We are not ap-
plying the science. We are not applying 
the opinions of the experts. We are just 
saying we want to randomly call some-
thing wilderness area and think that, 
randomly, our approach is going to be 
suppression. 
If our idea of management is suppres-
sion, we are losing ground. We should 
be doing things to prevent fire. An 
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of 
cure. And if our plan is we are just 
going to roll the dice but we can put 
the fire out when these wilderness 
areas catch on fire, I think we are 
sending the wrong message and we are 
making bad policy. 
So, again, I encourage my colleagues 
to vote for this amendment that is 
common sense and that will do good in 
the long run. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, just to 
reiterate, the way it works right now 
with existing wilderness areas is that

the region that is managing that wil-
derness area can decide, obviously, tak-
ing into account that it is a wilderness 
area. 
If it is a remote area, as we just saw 
in this photo, where burning would 
benefit the ecosystem, then they are 
allowed to burn, as they are in other 
areas of Federal land; but, if the re-
gional director in the management 
plan has a wilderness that is near an 
urban interface and it looks like homes 
and lives may be put at risk, they are 
allowed, under the Wilderness Act, to 
take that action. 
That is what I have been trying to 
tell my colleagues for years now. I 
think that the Panetta amendment 
makes that clear. I think that it allows 
us the power that we have in desig-
nating wilderness. 
Again, 
we 
shouldn’t 
offload 
our 
power to the executive branch or any 
other branch of government. I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
b 1415 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, if 
we are allowing management in an 
area, then, by definition, it shouldn’t 
be a wilderness area. If our plan is to 
put the fire out when it starts and it 
could possibly do damage to property 
or life, that is not a very good plan. 
We shouldn’t be putting areas into 
wilderness that is close to wildland- 
urban interfaces, that is close to where 
people live, and taking management 
completely off the table. 
I have wilderness areas in my district 
and in my State, and they are managed 
as wilderness areas, which means they 
are not managed at all. 
Again, this is common sense. Listen 
to the experts. If this area is not suit-
able to be in a wilderness area, we 
shouldn’t be designating it a wilderness 
area. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote for 
this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentleman from Arkansas will be 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MR. WESTERMAN 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 7 printed in 
House Report 116–395. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. I have an amend-
ment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 17, strike line 17 and all that follows 
through page 19, line 20. 
Strike section 233. 
Strike section 304. 
Strike section 307. 
Page 220, strike line 11 and all that follows 
through page 221, line 2. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, this 
strikes all the potential wilderness des-
ignations proposed in this package, 
which is a very vague and ambiguous 
designation that gives broad discretion 
to the relevant land management agen-
cies to designate these areas as wilder-
ness at a later time. 
As I previously mentioned during de-
bate on the last amendment, one of the 
clear flaws of the package before us is 
the apparent arbitrary process that 
was taken in determining the areas to 
designate as wilderness. This short-
coming, unfortunately, extends to the 
potential wilderness designations in 
the bill as well. 
Official testimony from the land 
management agencies raised concerns 
about many of these suspect designa-
tions not possessing appropriate wil-
derness characteristics. 
For example, in the Washington por-
tion of this package, many of the 5,000 
acres set to become potential wilder-
ness are largely near roads and include 
large amounts of previously harvested 
stands of timber. 
These are clearly roads that the pro-
ponents of this bill want to close. How-
ever, this is the wrong way to do that. 
Locking up vast swaths of land is a bad 
way to manage Federal land. 
And I reiterate, if we want to do 
something about atmospheric carbon 
and use our forest as a tool, locking 
them up where we can’t touch them is 
not the way to do that. We should be 
investing 
in 
sustainable, 
proactive 
measures that balance both resource 
stewardship and local input. 
This amendment will remove some of 
the ambiguity from this package and 
will allow local communities to con-
tinue to benefit from lands and roads 
in these areas. 
Mr. Chair, it is for those reasons I 
again urge my colleagues to vote for 
this amendment. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I claim the 
time in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, plain and 
simple, this amendment would remove 
all the potential wilderness from this 
bill, which totals over 130,000 acres. 
My colleagues are using this amend-
ment to claim that the wilderness 
areas in this bill don’t meet the defini-
tion or intent of the wilderness des-
ignation. 
Guess what? That is exactly why 
they are designated as ‘‘potential wil-
derness.’’ These are areas that are, for 
all intents and purposes, wilderness, 
but for a small nonconforming use. 
Since the quotation marks on the 
amendment description seem to show 
some lack of understanding about this 
designation, I would like to explain it 
for the RECORD. 
A potential wilderness designation 
typically means that an area has wil-
derness characteristics, but it recog-
nizes that there is a nonconforming use 
or activity that would otherwise be 
prohibited by a standard wilderness 
designation, which is exactly what my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
keep trying to argue. They keep trying 
to say: ‘‘Well, you know, you can’t 
have motorized activities. You can’t 
have this and that in wilderness,’’ and 
they are right. But that is why some of 
these areas are potential wilderness. 
Some examples of potential wilder-
ness allowances that would be im-
pacted by this amendment include al-
lowing redwood forest restoration, al-
lowing 
trail 
reconstruction 
using 
heavy equipment, and allowing the 
high-altitude helicopter operations in 
Colorado to continue in potential wil-
derness, because those uses are not ap-
propriate in wilderness but these areas 
have strong wilderness characteristics, 
but for that one activity. 
Potential 
wilderness 
designations 
simply say this: manage the area for 
the wilderness quality characteristics 
but continue to allow the specific use 
or activity. Then when that noncon-
forming use is removed, the area will 
then 
revert 
to 
wilderness 
because 
mostly that is what it is. 
Potential wilderness provides exactly 
the type of management flexibility 
that my colleagues claim is needed for 
certain areas, but they want to strike 
all of these designations from the bill. 
Frankly, it seems a little backward to 
me. 
For some of my friends on the other 
side of the aisle, I know it can be hard 
to see these areas for anything other 
than their extractive potential, but I 
see it from the other side of the coin. 
These areas are strong 
wilderness 
areas; they just have a small noncon-
forming use that eventually will be re-
moved, restoring these areas to wilder-
ness. That is why these areas are called 
potential wilderness. 
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
amendment. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, there 
are a couple of things that I would like 
to point out here. 
First off, I am having a hard time un-
derstanding the logic. I appreciate the 
gentlewoman trying to explain what 
these potential wilderness areas are, 
but in the debate on the last amend-
ment, the gentlewoman pointed out 
that we shouldn’t be ceding any power 
to the executive branch, which desig-
nating something a potential wilder-
ness area would cede all that power to 
the executive branch to determine if 
that could be a wilderness area in the 
future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1096 
February 12, 2020 
There is a process to designate a wil-
derness area. It is called a wilderness 
study area. We have done that all 
across the country. I have seen it done 
in my State, and there are certain cri-
teria that you have to meet when you 
are in a wilderness study area to be 
designated wilderness. 
Congress can change the law if they 
want to. They can violate the Wilder-
ness Protection Act that was put in 
place, but that is not a wise thing to 
do. 
For instance, there is an area in my 
State that is in a wilderness study area 
that has beautiful trees on it, but those 
trees are loblolly pine trees. They are 
nonnative to that site. So you could 
put that into a wilderness area, but by 
definition, you can’t have nonnative 
tree species on that site. 
Those are the kinds of things that 
the agencies look for when they go 
through a wilderness study program 
and when they propose to designate 
areas as wilderness. Just haphazardly 
doing it, putting it in areas where it 
shouldn’t be, and designating potential 
wilderness is leaving the science out it, 
and it is making it all about politics. 
Mr. Chair, again, I encourage my col-
leagues to be rational and to vote for 
this simple amendment. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close if the gentleman is 
ready. I think I have the right to close. 
Mr. Chair, I will reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, again, 
I encourage the adoption of this com-
monsense amendment; that we let the 
science rule; that we keep land avail-
able, our precious land and our pre-
cious resources to use in this fight to 
remove atmospheric carbon, to make 
the world a better place, and for envi-
ronmental stewardship for the future. 
That is why I offered this amendment 
and why I encourage my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, the 
131,702 acres of potential wilderness in 
this bill, they are in many of the sec-
tions of this legislation, and they all 
have strong wilderness characteristics 
but for one nonconforming use, which 
will be eventually gone, in which case 
it is imperative that we manage these 
areas as wilderness. 
Mr. Chair, that is why I oppose this 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no.’’ I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-

AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MR. 
CUNNINGHAM 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 8 printed in 
House Report 116–395. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill insert the following: 
TITLE VIII—MISCELLANEOUS 
SEC. 801. MILITARY ACTIVITIES. 
Nothing in this Act precludes— 
(1) low-level overflights of military air-
craft over wilderness areas; 
(2) the designation of new units of special 
airspace over wilderness areas; or 
(3) the establishment of military flight 
training routes over wilderness areas. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I rise 
in support of my amendment, which 
would make crystal clear that our men 
and women in uniform can continue to 
use the areas affected by this bill to 
conduct the training that they need to 
keep us safe. 
The underlying bill would designate 
over a million acres of federally owned 
land as new or potential wilderness, 
safeguarding these important natural 
resources for Americans to enjoy for 
generations. 
But these lands not only provide us 
with our outdoor recreation opportuni-
ties; they also serve as an important 
training ground for our Armed Forces 
as they prepare to defend our country 
overseas. 
My bipartisan, commonsense amend-
ment would ensure that our military 
aviators can continue to fly training 
missions and traverse the more than 
1.3 million acres of wilderness des-
ignated by this act. 
Now, this is critical because some 
areas affected by this bill are currently 
used by servicemembers at the High- 
Altitude Army National Guard Avia-
tion Training Site, which is rep-
resented by my colleague, Congress-
man TIPTON, who joined me in offering 
this amendment. 
This facility is the only place mili-
tary helicopter pilots can learn the ad-
vanced power management skills need-
ed to safely operate thousands of feet 
above sea level. 
Given the mountainous regions our 
troops presently operate in overseas, 
both in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is 
critically important that these train-
ing operations continue uninterrupted. 
Our public lands management agen-
cies have a long history of working 
with our military leaders. When it 
comes to protecting our public lands, 
this amendment shows that conserva-
tion and national security can go hand 
in hand. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting our amendment, 
ensuring that our servicemembers can 
continue to utilize America’s diverse 
natural resources to prepare to fight 
and win in any environment. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I ask unani-
mous consent to claim the time in op-
position, although I am not opposed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from 
Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I would like 
to 
thank 
my 
colleague, 
Mr. 
CUNNINGHAM, for putting forward this 
amendment. 
I do rise in opposition, though I am 
not opposed, ultimately, to the amend-
ment. I am glad to join my colleague 
from South Carolina as a cosponsor, ul-
timately, of this amendment to be able 
to ensure that military overflights can 
continue over areas that will be des-
ignated wilderness under the Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness Act. 
As my good friend from South Caro-
lina is aware, my district is home to 
the 
High-Altitude 
Army 
National 
Guard 
Aviation 
Training 
Site 
or 
HAATS, where our men and women in 
uniform learn how to fly rotary-wing 
aircraft safely in high-altitude envi-
ronments. 
Mr. Chair, five wilderness or poten-
tial wilderness areas are to be estab-
lished within the HAATS training area 
under the Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness Act. It is essential that when the 
time comes for aviation training to 
take place for the readiness of our 
Armed Forces that it is not interfering 
with the current and future wilderness 
proposals being debated and introduced 
in Congress. 
Although the gentleman’s amend-
ment doesn’t deal with the issue of 
landing zones, I do believe it is an im-
portant protection and a promising 
step forward. I would urge all of my 
colleagues to be able to support this 
amendment. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, in 
closing, I want to thank my friend 
from Colorado, Mr. TIPTON, for joining 
me in offering this bipartisan amend-
ment. Mr. Chair, I also want to thank 
Chairman GRIJALVA and my colleagues 
on the Natural Resources Committee 
for their work on this important legis-
lation. 
I hope that my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will join me in sup-
porting this amendment, which will 
make clear that our military can con-
tinue to utilize the airspace above 
these 
newly 
designated 
wilderness 
areas. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
CUNNINGHAM).

Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a 
letter and a resolution from the Mesa 
County Board of County Commis-
sioners and a letter from the Monte-
zuma County Board of County Commis-
sioners in opposition to the legislation 
that we have on the floor today. 
MESA COUNTY, COLORADO, 
BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, 
Grand Junction, CO, June 24, 2019. 
Re Colorado Wilderness Act of 2019, H.R. 2546. 
Hon. DIANA DEGETTE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. DEGETTE: As the Board of Coun-
ty Commissioners (‘‘Board’’) for Mesa Coun-
ty, Colorado, we are submitting this letter to 
voice our opposition to the Colorado Wilder-
ness Act of 2019, H.R. 2546. 
Mesa County has a well-established history 
of supporting sensible, multiple use of public 
lands and resources. The Board finds the pro-
posed Wilderness designations of more 140,000 
acres within Mesa County unacceptable and 
in direct conflict of the Mesa County Resolu-
tion adopted in opposition of the Colorado 
Wilderness Act of 2015, H.R. 3336 (enclosed). 
The areas proposed for Wilderness in Mesa 
County include: 
1. South Shale Ridge & Little Book Cliffs 
Proposed Wilderness—29,045 acres (proposed 
‘‘Little Bookcliffs Wilderness’’) 
2. South Shale Ridge & Little Book Cliffs 
Proposed Wilderness—27,517 acres (proposed 
‘‘South Shale Ridge Wilderness’’) 
3. Bangs Canyon Proposed Wilderness— 
20,996 acres (proposed ‘‘Bangs Canyon Wilder-
ness’’) 
4. Unaweep & Palisade Proposed Wilder-
ness—27,150 acres (proposed ‘‘Palisade Wil-
derness’’) 
5. Unaweep & Palisade Proposed Wilder-
ness—20,420 acres (proposed ‘‘Unaweep Wil-
derness’’) 
6. Sewemup Mesa Proposed Wilderness— 
15,208 acres (proposed ‘‘Sewemup Mesa Wil-
derness’’) 
As the most restrictive designation in land 
management, the Board believes Wilderness 
designations are often punitive in nature for 
many public land users whose impact is neg-
ligible. In addition to ending multiple use of 
public lands, Wilderness designations: 
1. eliminate the opportunity to manage 
forest level concerns with the flexibility nec-
essary for ever-changing conditions; 
2. remove the ability to properly address 
the tremendous buildup of natural fuels due 
to 
unprecedented 
beetle 
kill 
thus 
compounding the potential and severity of 
wildfires; 
3. abolish future uses that enhance the so-
cial and economic futures of area residents 
and businesses; 
4. place undue burden on adjacent property 
owners, lessees and other non-recreation for-
est users who face potential loss of income 
due to restricted travel; 
5. discriminate against citizens unable to 
walk or ride horseback, including those with 
disabilities and the elderly. 
As a County comprised of 72% public lands, 
the Board believes the management of these 
public lands should be decided with area re-
source management plans developed in co-
operation with federal, state and local gov-
ernments as well as the multitude of user 
groups and area citizens, not by a process 
where those most affected have no voice. 
Given the above concerns and those in the 
attached Resolution, Mesa County cannot 
support this proposed legislation. Further-
more, we encourage the Colorado Congres-
sional delegation to introduce legislation to 
release all Wilderness Study Areas from 
their perpetual existence as de facto Wilder-
ness. 
Please do not hesitate to contact the Mesa 
County Commissioners should you wish to 
discuss this further. 
Sincerely, 
ROSE PUGLIESE, 
Chair, Board of Coun-
ty Commissioners. 
SCOTT MCINNIS, 
Commissioner. 
JOHN JUSTMAN, 
Commissioner. 
RESOLUTION # lll 
A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF COUNTY COM-
MISSIONERS OF MESA COUNTY, COLORADO OP-
POSING THE COLORADO WILDERNESS ACT OF 
2015 (H.R. 3336) AND CALLING ON CONGRESS TO 
RELEASE ALL WILDERNESS STUDY AREAS IN 
COLORADO 
Whereas, the Colorado Wilderness Act of 
2015 (H.R. 3336) (the ‘‘Wilderness Act’’) has 
been introduced into Congress as the latest 
annual attempt to create Wilderness Areas 
without the participation or endorsement of 
the communities in which the areas are lo-
cated; and 
Whereas, Mesa County has formally de-
clared its position on previous Wilderness 
proposals throughout the past years, (see Ex-
hibit A—MCA 2001–17, MCM 2008–049, MCM 
2009–175); and 
Whereas, the Wilderness Act has been in-
troduced by a Congressional Representative 
who does not reside in or represent the con-
gressional districts that would be most im-
pacted by this proposed legislation; and 
Whereas, motorized and mechanized recre-
ation 
are 
prohibited 
within 
Wilderness 
Areas; and 
Whereas, motorized and mechanized recre-
ation are areas of important and steady eco-
nomic growth throughout Colorado and spe-
cifically in Mesa County; and 
Whereas, the Wilderness Act will close off 
approximately 715,000 acres across the state 
to all mechanized use, such as mountain 
bikes, chainsaws, ATV’s, snowmobiles, and 
motorcycles; and 
Whereas, Colorado will face a potential 
firestorm with the tremendous buildup of 
natural fuels due to unprecedented beetle 
kill and the inability to lower fuel loads by 
mechanized thinning under Wilderness des-
ignation; and 
Whereas, the Wilderness Act would place 
undue hardship on anyone who cannot walk 
or ride horseback to enjoy these areas of Col-
orado, such as the physically disabled or el-
derly, and would seem to violate the spirit of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act, if not 
the letter of the law; and 
Whereas, Wilderness designation would 
place undue hardship on livestock growers to 
maintain fences and water sources within 
the Wilderness Areas; and 
Whereas, once designated a Wilderness 
Area, an act of Congress is needed to take 
the area out of Wilderness; and 
Whereas, the numerous ‘‘Wilderness Study 
Areas’’ identified within the Wilderness Act 
have been inventoried as such over the past 
several decades, are mandated to be managed 
as de facto Wilderness Areas, and can only be 
released from this designation by an act of 
Congress; and 
Whereas, Mesa County has acted in good 
faith through various memoranda of under-
standing and as a cooperating agency as a 
partner in land use planning with the Bureau 
of Land Management, the U. S. Forest Serv-
ice and other agencies regarding the long- 
term protection and management of special 
areas worthy of unique management; and 
Whereas, Mesa County intends to continue 
to coordinate cooperatively with the Bureau 
of Land Management, the U. S. Forest Serv-
ice and other agencies on land management 
issues. 
Now, therefore the Board of County Com-
missioners of Mesa County, Colorado finds 
that: 
1. The Colorado Wilderness Act of 2015 (HB 
3336) is not in the best interest of the citizens 
of Mesa County and the State of Colorado, 
and it would cause undue economic hardship 
on the surrounding communities. 
2. Congress should release all Wilderness 
Study Areas (WSA) in Mesa County from 
such designation to allow for true multiple 
use those lands that are unduly restricted 
from appropriate use as WSAs. 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved that the Board of County Commis-
sioners of Mesa County, Colorado: 
1. stands opposed to the Colorado Wilder-
ness Act of 2015 (HB 3336) in its current form; 
and 
2. calls upon the Colorado Congressional 
delegation to introduce legislation to release 
all Wilderness Study Areas within Mesa 
County from such designation. 
Passed and Adopted this 21st day of Sep-
tember 2015.

County: Rose Pugliese, Chair. 
MONTEZUMA COUNTY, 
BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, 
Cortez, CO, May 28, 2019. 
Re Colorado Wilderness Act of 2019. 
Hon. DIANA DEGETTE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CONGRESSWOMAN: Respectfully, we 
are writing you as a County Commission to 
let you know that Montezuma County ob-
jects to the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2019. 
We have been consistently opposed since the 
Act was first proposed. 
We ask you to permanently withdraw 
those portions of Montezuma County that 
are included in the bill as per the BLM and 
our recommendations. These areas include; 
Weber Mountain, Menefee Mountain, Cross 
Canyon, Cahone Canyon and Squaw and Pa-
poose Canyons. 
Since the early 1990’s, Montezuma County 
has collaborated with federal land managers

in effort to develop public land management 
strategies that provide reasonable and re-
sponsible protection for our natural re-
sources and wild lands. This collaboration 
has built an effective working relationship 
with federal land managers that allows us 
better protect natural resources while also 
ensuring the public have access to their pub-
lic lands. 
We believe we already have a good strategy 
in place for the protection of the WSAs being 
proposed for wilderness that maintains or 
improves their current characteristics for fu-
ture generations while providing better ac-
cess for the public to enjoy those lands in a 
responsible and appropriate manner. 
Congresswoman, 
We have seven major areas of concern with 
regard to the proposed Wilderness designa-
tions in Southwest Colorado that we feel 
have not been addressed with us and you 
need to be aware of: 
1. Compatibility; the potential Wilderness 
Area designation has some compatibility 
problems with the surrounding private lands, 
their maintenance, and public access. 
2. Best Protection of Resources; The pro-
posed wilderness designations present a 
threat to landscapes that have been well pro-
tected under the current management. 
3. The proposed legislation will create 
management difficulties for both federal 
land managers and for surrounding private 
landowners and threatens public health, 
safety and wellbeing. 
4. The proposed legislation undermines the 
integrity of the BLM Land and Resource 
Management Planning process. 
5. Proposed wilderness designations can 
trigger intense and protracted disputes over 
downstream water rights. 
6. Economics. Wilderness Areas are not al-
ways good for a local economy. Often Wilder-
ness leads to rural gentrification and dis-
rupts local cultures and traditions. 
7. The proposed legislation is a breach of 
the local-federal cooperation that we have 
all worked so hard to cultivate in Southwest 
Colorado. 
Conclusions and Recommendations. 
Montezuma County objects to the proposed 
Wilderness designation of; 
1. Weber Mountain 
2. Menefee Mountain 
3. Cross Canyon 
4. Cahone Canyon 
5. Squaw and Papoose Canyon 
We request that these five WSAs be 
dropped from your Bill. And we further re-
quest 
your 
support 
in 
Congressional 
delisting of those five WSAs. 
We also would request your support in 
working with the BLM to re-designate those 
WSAs as Special Recreational Management 
Areas (SRMAs) and provide input in devel-
oping a customized protection plan for each 
SRMA that analyzes and mitigates the spe-
cific threats to the resources without throw-
ing away recreational opportunities that 
may be perfectly suitable, and compatible 
with protection of resources. 
We can’t speak for the rest of the Western 
Slope, but in Montezuma County, we ask 
that our efforts to work with the federal 
land management agencies be respected. Any 
needed land protection measures should be 
developed through an open collaborative 
process in conjunction with mandated land 
and resource management planning and 
NEPA processes. 
We do not feel that Wilderness Designation 
has been propose through a collaborative and 
transparent process at all. Please contact us 
at your earliest convenience. We look for-
ward to working with you to craft specific 
protections that meet the public expecta-
tions, respects our culture and traditions, 
and truly protect resources. 
Sincerely yours, 
THE MONTEZUMA COUNTY 
BOARD OF 
COMMISSIONERS, KEENAN 
G. ERTEL, LARRY DON 
SUCKLA, JIM CANDELARIA. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, the ma-
jority of the land in Title I of the un-
derlying bill would be converted into 
wilderness and it is in my district. 
While I am never pleased when an-
other Member of the House tries to tell 
my constituents what is best for them, 
I get especially frustrated when they 
ignore the opinions of elected officials 
in the communities in which they are 
seeking to make land management des-
ignations. 
For instance, I might think that des-
ignating wilderness between Denver 
and Boulder would cut down on the 
challenges the State is facing with pop-
ulation growth might be something to 
consider, yet I have refrained from in-
troducing such a proposal. 
The underlying bill seeks to convert 
several wilderness study areas in the 
Third Congressional District into wil-
derness. The two that I focused on in 
this amendment are in Montezuma 
County. 
During the hearing on the underlying 
bill, Montezuma County Commissioner 
Keenan Ertel testified in opposition to 
the proposed wilderness additions in 
the county. In a letter he sent to me 
and to the bill’s sponsor, the board of 
county commissioners wrote: 
We have been consistently opposed since 
the act was first proposed. We ask you to 
permanently withdraw those portions of 
Montezuma County that are included in the 
bill as per the BLM and our recommenda-
tions. 
Since the early 1990’s, Montezuma County 
has collaborated with Federal land managers 
in an effort to develop public land manage-
ment strategies that provide reasonable and 
responsible protection for our natural re-
sources and wild lands. This collaboration 
has built an effective working relationship 
with Federal land managers that allows us 
to better protect natural resources while 
also ensuring the public have access to their 
public lands. 
We believe we already have a good strategy 
in place for the protection of the WSAs being 
proposed for wilderness that maintains or 
improves their current characteristics for fu-
ture generations while providing better ac-
cess for the public to enjoy those lands in a 
responsible and appropriate manner. 
In the letter, the commissioners 
mention the BLM’s recommendation. 
This is because the BLM studied the 
lands that my colleague is proposing to 
be added to wilderness and determined 
that they are not suitable. In fact, one 
of the parcels has a D8 bulldozer sitting 
on the land. This doesn’t meet the 
standard of untrammeled by man. 
Aside from the fact that the BLM has 
determined that these lands are not 
suitable for wilderness, the current 
WSA designation has created manage-
ment challenges for the county when it 
comes to noxious weeds, wildfire pre-
vention and mitigation, and managing 
the challenges of the Federal-private 
checkerboard that we see throughout 
the West. 
It is for all of these reasons, but espe-
cially because of the local opposition, 
that I urged my colleagues to remove 
the land in Montezuma County from 
the bill during the legislative process. 
Additionally, my colleague’s amend-
ment to the underlying bill added addi-
tional land to Montezuma and Dolores 
Counties for wilderness designation. I 
will note that the counties are also op-
posed to these lands being added as in-
dicated in their opposition letter. 
While this amendment focuses on 
land in Montezuma County, I also want 
to say that the Mesa County Board of 
County Commissioners has written to 
me and the bill’s sponsor about its op-
position to the bill and the proposed 
wilderness additions in its county. 
There seems to be a common theme 
here. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
my amendment. But given the lack of 
local support this bill has in western 
Colorado, 
this 
amendment 
is 
not 
enough to fix the flaws of the bill. 
Therefore, I will encourage my col-
leagues who believe that local input is 
important in land management deci-
sions to oppose the underlying bill. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. 
DEGETTE. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Colorado is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I have 
nothing but great affection and respect 
for my friend from the Third Congres-
sional District, and I have worked with 
him and his predecessors as I have de-
veloped this bill over the last 20-plus 
years, 
but 
I 
respectfully 
have 
to 
strongly disagree with him over his 
proposal to remove these two areas 
from the legislation. 
As a matter of fact, as I mentioned 
earlier in general debate, I actually 
went to these two areas over the Au-
gust recess and I visited these areas. I 
invited Mr. TIPTON to come, but he was 
unavailable. When we were in the Cross 
Canyon area, we rode in on horses be-
cause there are no trails. It is com-
pletely inaccessible. There we saw an-
cestral pueblos. We saw petroglyphs 
with our own eyes. 
When we went to the Weber-Menefee 
area to the area overlooking it, we saw 
really clearly how this area was wild 
and needed protection. And, by the 
way, the areas with the noxious weeds 
were several miles away, not even close 
to the wilderness area. 
I do understand these concerns, but I 
believe these two areas are a case 
study for who you should listen to 
when 
you 
decide 
what 
wilderness 
should be. 
As I said in general debate, when 
Commissioner Ertel came to testify be-
fore Congress, he rightly said that I 
had never been to these two areas. So, 
last August I went there, and I toured 
the areas. I had a town hall meeting in 
Cortez, which is the town that is right 
in between these two areas. We had 
over 70 people who showed up at this

February 12, 2020 
town hall meeting, and I presented 
what the bill was. Several other people 
asked questions, presented opposing 
views. 
At the end I just had a gut feeling 
that there was support there, so I took 
an impromptu survey, and I asked the 
people in that room, ‘‘How many of 
you, knowing what you know, would 
support designation of Cross Canyon 
and Weber-Menefee as wilderness?’’ 
Sixty-five people raised their hands. 
Then I asked, ‘‘How many of you would 
oppose it?’’ Four people raised their 
hands. When I asked, ‘‘How many are 
neutral,’’ 
four 
people 
raised 
their 
hands. 
It seems to me we shouldn’t be hav-
ing local county commissioners have 
veto power either over the citizens in 
those areas or over the U.S. Congress 
in determining wilderness. And by the 
way, the local mayor of Cortez and the 
town council have all voted to support 
designation of these areas—both of 
which have been wilderness study areas 
for over 30 years—permanently. 
That is why we need to keep these 
areas in our bill. That is why they need 
to be designated as wilderness because 
they are wild and pristine. 
And that is why I humbly and re-
spectfully ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
amendment 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I am 
grateful that my colleague, who I also 
have a lot of respect for, did come down 
to Montezuma County. 
I hope while the gentlewoman was 
there, she had the opportunity to spend 
a little money, buy a few presents to 
take back and help an area that is 
often left out and forgotten in Colo-
rado. 
What the gentlewoman spoke to is 
important. She mentioned that the 
city council and the mayor were sup-
portive. That is great. But they aren’t 
responsible for the county lands, which 
the county commissioners are respon-
sible for. It was within the confines of 
the city limits. Does that diminish 
their right to be able to have an opin-
ion? It does not. 
What is not being addressed is these 
are already protected lands. There isn’t 
a person in the State of Colorado or in 
the country that can go on any of those 
lands and try to develop them, to put 
in a road, to put in a tower for trans-
mission. 
That 
would 
have 
to 
go 
through a planning process, a comment 
process, if anything were to happen. 
Those local comments, the impacts 
that our county commissioners are see-
ing, those who are responsible for the 
land should not be ignored, should be 
listened to, and I would encourage the 
adoption of my amendment. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, the 
gentleman should be assured we spent 
quite a little bit of money in your 
town. 
I just want to say what the gen-
tleman said points to exactly what I 
am saying. He says that the Cortez 
town council and mayor are not man-
aging the county lands. Well, guess 
what, the county commissioners aren’t 
managing the Federal lands. These are 
Federal lands. These are wilderness 
study areas, and they have been wilder-
ness study areas for almost 30 years. 
The residents, the local residents, they 
are the ones that should care. They are 
the ones using these areas and they 
want them to be preserved. 
Mr. Chairman, I refer again, on the 
Western Slope in the areas referenced 
in this bill, New Bridge Strategy did a 
poll last October of 2019, and they 
found that in those areas, 71 percent of 
Coloradans support wilderness protec-
tions for those already managed as 
such, like these two areas. And 63 per-
cent supported expanding wilderness 
protections across the State. These are 
the people who matter. These are the 
people who care. 
Also, we have a list of 80 different 
groups, most of them on the Western 
Slope, and we have a list of 179 business 
owners and community leaders, most 
of them on the Western Slope, who sup-
port this legislation. The reason is be-
cause the local governments and the 
county 
governments 
are 
benefiting 
from the visits that they have to these 
areas. 
In Cortez, one of the biggest employ-
ers is Osprey. Almost everybody has an 
Osprey backpack or something in their 
home. They are selling their goods to 
the people who are using these areas. 
That is why I oppose this amend-
ment. That is why we need to pass this 
bill, and we need to protect these areas 
that are already wilderness study areas 
and have been for 30 years, for the fu-
ture generations to come. 
I include in the RECORD the list of 
business owners and the conservation 
and recreation groups, as well as the 
survey from New Bridge Strategy.

NEW BRIDGE STRATEGY. 
To: Interested Parties 
From: Lori Weigel & Kathryn Hahne/New 
Bridge Strategy 
Date: October 21, 2019 
Re Support for Colorado Wilderness Act in 
Survey of Western Slope Voters 
New Bridge Strategy recently completed a 
survey of voters throughout western Colo-
rado—an area largely consisting of the Third 
Congressional District—to determine their 
views on a range of conservation issues, par-
ticularly increasing wilderness designations 
on some lands in the West. The study found 
strong support for the Colorado Wilderness 
Act to increase wilderness primarily in 
desert and canyon areas in their region. 
They also want to keep Wilderness Study 
Areas intact, rather than removing that des-
ignation on some public lands. This support 
may be grounded in the fact that voters view 
public lands as beneficial for the economy. 
They also anticipate outdoor recreation be-
coming increasingly important in the region. 
This is not surprising given that most voters 
in this region say that they engage in out-
door recreation activities and/or sportsmen 
activities. 
Specifically, the survey found that . . . 
More than three-in-five Western Slope vot-
ers support ‘‘dedicating additional, existing 
public lands as wilderness areas here in Colo-
rado.’’ Fully 63 percent support dedicating 
more land as wilderness in Colorado after 
hearing a brief explanation of what this 
would entail. Respondents were told that 
‘‘Just over fifty years ago Congress passed 
the Wilderness Act, which protected the Ma-
roon Bells and the San Juan Mountains here 
in Colorado. These areas are designated as 
wilderness in order to keep that land con-
served in its natural state. Wilderness lands 
can be used for hiking, camping, livestock 
grazing, horseback riding, wildlife watching, 
hunting and fishing. However, mining, oil 
and gas development, logging, and the use of 
motorized or off-road vehicles and mountain 
bikes are not allowed on wilderness lands.’’ 
Again, after hearing this neutral expla-
nation, there is solid support of 63 percent, 
and fully 42 percent ‘‘strongly’’ support it. 
Only 35 percent register opposition to this 
proposal. Support for increasing the amount 
of wilderness in Colorado is evident through-
out the entire district as well. 
Support for extending wilderness protec-
tions has appeal among virtually all sub- 
groups, including a majority of hunters (55 
percent) and anglers (62 percent), and sur-
prisingly, off-road vehicle users (55 percent 
support, 43 percent oppose). More than two- 
thirds of every other type of outdoor recre-
ation enthusiast expressed support, includ-
ing 80 percent of mountain bikers, 75 percent 
of bird/wildlife watchers, and 73 percent of 
hikers). A majority across party lines also 
express support, with near universal support 
among Democrats (94 percent), and nearly 
three-in-five Republicans (59 percent) and 
unaffiliated voters (59 percent) registering 
support for additional wilderness areas in 
Colorado. 
In addition, once voters know that ‘‘just 
five percent of Colorado lands are currently 
dedicated as wilderness areas,’’ support for 
dedicating additional public lands as wilder-
ness increases to fully 69 percent. 
Likewise, there is significant support for 
adding wilderness protections to public lands 
in desert and canyons regions of the state. 
Fully 68 percent express support for a pro-
posal that would ‘‘designate as wilderness 
lands areas that include some desert canyons 
and mesas, such as lands near Mesa Verde 
National Park, and natural areas along the 
Arkansas and Dolores Rivers. These amount 
to less than 10 percent of the public lands in 
southern and western Colorado.’’ Two-in-five 
(40 percent) strongly support the proposal, 
while 29 percent oppose it. This proposal en-
genders majority support across party lines 
(92 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of unaf-
filiated voters and 54 percent of Repub-
licans), and with virtually every sub-group 
examined. It has solid support throughout 
the district, including in Mesa County (66 
percent support). 
Voters in this region also reject calls to 
eliminate protections for Wilderness Study 
Areas. Western Colorado voters prefer that 
Congress keep existing public lands in Wil-
derness Study Areas, rather than removing 
that designation to those lands by a nearly 
three to one margin, as the next graph illus-
trates. 
Majorities of all key voter sub-groups pre-
fer that Congress keep the status quo. This 
includes more than three-in-five Republican 
and unaffiliated voters in the region (61 per-
cent say to keep the areas as they are, while 
34 percent would change their status) and 
virtually all Democrats (97 percent keep as 
is). The desire to retain Wilderness Study 
Areas is evident throughout the region, in-
cluding in Mesa County (70 percent). 
Support for these public lands proposals 
may be grounded in the fact that voters 
make a connection between their economy 
and the outdoors. The overwhelming major-
ity of voters in western Colorado say they 
presence of public lands in Colorado helps 
our economy (84 percent) rather than hurts 
it (6 percent) or has little impact on the 
economy (8 percent). Majorities of every sin-
gle sub-group hold the perception that public 
lands help the economy. 
Similarly, the survey demonstrates that 
voters in this region view the ‘‘outdoor econ-
omy’’ as being ‘‘very important’’ to their 
economic future. Fully 68 percent charac-
terize the outdoor economy which in the sur-
vey we defined as ‘‘people who come to hunt, 
fish, camp, hike, see wildlife, as well as those 
who manufacture and sell equipment for 
those activities’’ as being very important to 
‘‘the economic future of western Colorado.’’ 
Another one-in-four (25 percent) say it is 
‘‘somewhat important,’’ and a mere 7 percent 
do not see it as important. Both Democrats 
(76 percent) and Republicans (70 percent) 
view the outdoor economy as very important 
to the economic future of western Colorado. 
The vast majority of western Coloradans 
engage in outdoor recreation themselves. 
When asked about their own ties to the out-
doors, the vast majority of voters here are 
participating in many activities. Many iden-
tify as either a hunter (39%) or an angler (52 
percent). More than nine-in-ten say that 
they regularly participate in some other 
form of outdoor recreation, with a range of 
activities identified: 
64% Hiking or trail running, 64% Camping, 
51% Bird watching and viewing wildlife, 30% 
Kayaking, canoeing or boating, 36% Riding 
an off-road vehicle or snowmobile, 36% Snow 
shoeing, skiing or boarding, 22% Mountain 
biking. 
In fact, a majority say that they regularly 
participate in three or more of these activi-
ties (56 percent). 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge 
a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado will be 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 10 OFFERED BY MR. TIPTON 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 10 printed 
in House Report 116–395. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I have 
an amendment at the desk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1102 
February 12, 2020 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
After section 105, insert the following: 
SEC. 106. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STUDY ON 
IMPACTS THAT THE EXPANSION OF 
WILDERNESS DESIGNATIONS IN THE 
WESTERN UNITED STATES WOULD 
HAVE ON THE READINESS OF THE 
ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED 
STATES WITH RESPECT TO AVIATION 
TRAINING. 
(a) STUDY REQUIRED.—The Secretary of De-
fense shall conduct a study on the impacts 
that the expansion of wilderness designa-
tions in the Western United States would 
have on the readiness of the Armed Forces of 
the United States with respect to aviation 
training. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall submit to the Committees on 
Armed Services of the Senate and House of 
Representatives a report on the study re-
quired under subsection (a). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, military aviation and 
training is critical to the national se-
curity interests of the United States 
and the readiness of our Armed Forces. 
My district is home to one of the in-
stallations 
that 
conducts 
military 
aviation training missions for our men 
and women in uniform, the High Alti-
tude Army National Guard Aviation 
Training Site, or HAATS, located in 
Gypsum, Colorado. 
It is both an honor and a privilege to 
be able to represent the lone U.S. De-
partment of Defense schoolhouse where 
rotary-wing aviators in our Nation’s 
Armed Forces and our foreign allies 
learn how to be able to safely fly ro-
tary-wing 
aircraft 
in 
mountainous 
high-altitude environments. The life- 
saving training that is required by our 
servicemen and women at HAATS is 
vital to our national security and our 
readiness. 
Mr. Chairman, Title I of the Pro-
tecting 
America’s 
Wilderness 
Act 
would establish five wilderness or po-
tential wilderness areas within the 
HAATS training area. 
During 
this 
Congress, 
numerous 
pieces of legislation designating wil-
derness continue to be introduced with-
out taking into consideration the po-
tential effects that these designations 
would have on readiness. Proactively, 
Congress should work to be able to en-
sure current and future wilderness pro-
posals do not interfere with readiness 
of our Armed Forces when it comes to 
aviation training. 
Mr. Chairman, my amendment would 
require the Secretary of Defense to 
conduct a study, which would examine 
the impacts of the expansion of wilder-
ness 
designations 
in 
the 
western 
United States and what they would 
have on the readiness of our Armed 
Forces with respect to aviation train-
ing. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1445 
Ms. 
DEGETTE. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment, even though I am not op-
posed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from Colorado 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, there has 
been a lot of debate for a long time 
about how this bill might or might not 
impact military training in Colorado, 
and I myself have been concerned 
about this for some years. We have 
been looking at this for over 10 years, 
ever since we found out about the high- 
altitude 
training 
by 
the 
National 
Guard. 
We have provisions in the underlying 
bill and, of course, we have accepted an 
amendment from Mr. CUNNINGHAM that 
would clearly say nothing in this bill 
will interfere with the HAATS activi-
ties. As a matter of fact, we removed 
several areas from the original bill 
that we found out had helicopter land-
ing pads in them and we called them 
potential wilderness, because, frankly, 
I don’t think that landing a helicopter 
in an area is an approved wilderness 
use, and I have said that all along. 
So, therefore, we want to make sure 
that the National Guard can continue 
to do its landing in these areas as long 
as it deems that it is necessary to do 
so. We have written the underlying bill 
that way. Mr. CUNNINGHAM’s amend-
ment clarifies it. And, frankly, if this 
amendment will help to clarify the sit-
uation even more, I would be happy to 
go along with that because I do not in-
tend, and I don’t think any of the other 
bill sponsors intend, to interfere with 
our national defense. 
People might be surprised to find out 
the findings of the study once it comes 
out, because the Pentagon often sup-
ports the protective buffer that wilder-
ness offers for aviation training. Also, 
this bill is supported by a number of 
veterans and other military organiza-
tions. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a 
letter dated February 11, 2020, from the 
Vet Voice Foundation that shows sup-
port for this legislation and, in par-
ticular, support for the wilderness in 
this legislation. 
VET VOICE FOUNDATION, 
February 11, 2020. 
Subject: Vet Voice Foundation Support for 
H.R. 2546—Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness Act. 
Hon. DIANA DEGETTE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN DEGETTE: I am Paul 
Eaton, Major General (Ret.), U.S. Army, who 
served more than 30 years in the United 
States Army, including combat and post- 
combat assignments in Iraq, Bosnia and So-
malia, and Senior Advisor for the Vet Voice 
Foundation (VVF). The VVF serves as a plat-
form for veterans to influence policy out-
comes and has over 500,000 members with 
over 34,000 living in California and Colorado. 
We write to express our support for H.R. 
2546—Protecting America’s Wilderness Act. 
Our support for H.R. 2546 is based on our 
intent to protect our public lands. Those who 
serve our country fought to preserve Amer-
ican freedoms and lifestyles. Almost nothing 
better encapsulates these ideals than the 
wild spaces and ecologically rich lands that 
have changed little since our country’s 
founding, thanks to the laws that protect 
them. 
Through our work, we know veterans re-
turn from war and turn to the outdoors to 
find relief from the trauma and stresses of 
war and reintegration. For many veterans 
who’ve returned from locations marked by 
desperation and violent conflict, nature and 
wildlife can be a critical source of strength 
and healing. The Protecting America’s Wil-
derness Act would ensure veterans and fu-
ture generations have access to the great 
outdoors. 
We also recognize that the Protecting 
America’s Wilderness Act would provide per-
manent protections for landscapes in Colo-
rado, California, and Washington by desig-
nating over 1.3 million acres of federal land 
as new, expanded or potential wilderness and 
safeguarding more than 1,200 miles of river 
as components of the National Wild and Sce-
nic River System. These bills are the product 
of years of input by a wide variety of stake-
holders and will boost local economies, 
recreation opportunities, and protect wild-
life and their habitats. 
In order to protect and defend our public 
lands, we strongly support H.R. 2546—Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness Act. 
Thank you for your continued support of 
our public lands and consideration of Vet 
Voice Foundation’s views. If we can be of as-
sistance on this matter, please do not hesi-
tate to contact me. 
Respectfully, 
PAUL EATON, 
Major General (Ret.), U.S. Army, 
Senior Advisor, Vet Voice Foundation. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I urge sup-
port for Mr. TIPTON’s amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate the comments of Ms. DEGETTE of 
Colorado, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. KILMER) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I am proud 
to offer this amendment to make two 
key improvements to title VI of this 
bill, which designates 19 Wild and Sce-
nic Rivers on the Olympic Peninsula of 
Washington State. 
First, this amendment will further 
protect the interests of Washington 
State’s Department of Natural Re-
sources to manage State-owned lands 
adjacent to new Wild and Scenic River 
designations. 
Building on the savings clause al-
ready included in the base text, which 
explicitly protects DNR’s management 
authority, this amendment would fur-
ther require the Secretary of Agri-
culture to enter into cooperative agree-
ments with DNR to manage the four 
new Wild and Scenic Rivers that abut 
DNR lands. 
This important change will ensure 
that DNR not only retains the author-
ity to manage State-owned lands, but 
also has a clear voice in how the Forest 
Service 
manages 
their 
surrounding 
Federal lands that fall within the adja-
cent Wild and Scenic River corridor. 
This small but important change has 
led our State Commissioner of Public 
Lands, Hilary Franz, to give her strong 
support to this bill. 
Second, this amendment directs the 
Secretary of Agriculture to complete 
the 19 comprehensive river manage-
ment plans through the long-overdue 
process of updating the forest manage-
ment plan for the Olympic National 
Forest, 
sets 
a 
maximum 
5-year 
timeline for updating the forest plan, 
and allows the Secretary to request ad-
ditional funds to complete the forest 
plan update if needed. 
This provision will ensure that this 
critical forest plan update, which was 
last revised nearly three decades ago, 
does not take a backseat to the devel-
opment of these comprehensive river 
management plans. It also ensures that 
the Secretary will have sufficient re-
sources to complete the update in a 
timely manner. 
This 
amendment 
was 
developed 
through direct consultation with local 
stakeholders 
and 
will 
ultimately 
strengthen title VI of this bill. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment, even though I am not op-
posed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Arkansas is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I 
have had an opportunity to visit this 
beautiful part of the world that my col-
league from Washington represents, 
and I know that he has the best inter-
ests of those beautiful forests and 
beautiful natural areas at heart, and it 
is because of this and because of this 
commonsense amendment that I can 
rise in support of it. 
Although I do not believe it goes far 
enough to address some of the legiti-
mate concerns raised by local stake-
holders, it is a great step in the right 
direction. 
Instead of simply removing proposed 
wild and scenic designations from 
State trust lands that are managed by 
the Washington Department of Natural 
Resources to generate revenue for 
schools, counties, and other bene-
ficiaries, the amendment directs the 
Secretary of Agriculture to work with 
the DNR to develop these cooperative 
management agreements to guide the 
management of those rivers. 
Now, overlaying DNR trust lands 
with wild and scenic designations sub-
jects these trust lands to additional 
process, and I believe it will make it 
more difficult for DNR to propose tim-
ber harvest in these areas that could 
potentially cost school funding and 
other benefits. 
The savings language added in this 
amendment can only clarify what is re-
quired under Federal law. Nothing in 
the savings language alleviates DNR 
from potential added burdens under 
Washington 
State’s 
Environmental 
Protection Act, potential litigation 
based on the wild and scenic overlays 
and adjacent wilderness, or precludes 
potential State litigation based on the 
new designations. 
This amendment also appears to rec-
ognize the tremendous burden this leg-
islation will put on the Olympic Na-
tional Forest. 
Under the Wild and Scenic Act, the 
Olympic will be required to prepare 
comprehensive 
river 
management 
plans for 19 new Wild and Scenic Rivers 
across 464 miles of river, all of that 
within 3 years. 
The amendment seeks to give the for-
est the potential for a 2-year extension, 
but the reality is the staff of this forest 
will be spending the next several years 
doing paperwork instead of proposing 
projects to restore forest, to replace 
culverts, or increase timber harvest, 
all things that have broad support. All 
the while, the Olympic National Forest 
is still living under a forest plan that 
hasn’t been revised since 1994, when the 
Clinton Northwest Forest Plan was 
adopted. 
Most of the rivers proposed for the 
wild and scenic designation were not 
found to be suitable by the Forest 
Service. Currently, in the State of 
Washington, there are 197 miles of Wild 
and Scenic River. This legislation 
would more than quintuple the miles of 
Wild and Scenic River in Washington. 
So, Mr. Chair, while I wish this 
amendment went further, I congratu-
late my colleague and encourage him 
to continue working with stakeholders, 
and I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this amendment which does 
make the underlying bill better. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, first of all, I 
thank the gentleman for his support 
for this amendment. 
Again, it makes two changes that I 
think strengthen the legislation: to en-
sure that there is not an impact on 
State DNR harvest; and, hopefully, to 
see the Forest Service move forward 
with an update to the forest manage-
ment plan, which is a long time com-
ing, a long-overdue process to move 
forward. That is why we are putting 
forward this amendment; it is why it 
strengthens the legislation. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of adopting my amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 12 OFFERED BY MS. SCHRIER 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 12 printed 
in House Report 116–395. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk made in order 
under the rule.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1104 
February 12, 2020 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 234, after line 21, insert the following 
(and redesignate subsequent provisions ac-
cordingly): 
TITLE VII—STUDY ON FLOOD RISK 
MITIGATION 
SEC. 701. STUDY ON FLOOD RISK MITIGATION. 
The Comptroller General shall conduct a 
study to determine the contributions of wil-
derness designations under this Act to pro-
tections to flood risk mitigation in residen-
tial areas. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 844, the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, first, I would like to ap-
plaud the work of my colleagues, Rep-
resentative KILMER and Representative 
DEGETTE, for all the hard work they 
have done on this underlying, very im-
portant bill. It is a great bill for Wash-
ington, and I will be supporting it. Pro-
tecting wilderness areas is so impor-
tant to maintain Washington’s beau-
tiful environment for future genera-
tions. 
My amendment to the bill is very 
simple. It requires the Government Ac-
countability Office to study how pre-
serving wilderness lands can help re-
duce flood risks in residential areas. 
The area in this photo is practically 
in my backyard. Over the past week, 
Washington State has experienced se-
vere winter storms. The Governor of 
Washington State recently issued an 
emergency proclamation for 25 coun-
ties due to flooding and winter weath-
er. Three of those counties, Kittitas, 
King, and Pierce, are located in the 
Eighth Congressional District, my con-
gressional district. 
In my district, these storms largely 
took the form of excessive rain and 
flooding. They caused landslides on a 
highway that cut off access to the 
Greenwater community and Crystal 
Mountain, Washington’s largest ski 
area, which was closed for 4 days in a 
very busy, typical weekend period. 
In Issaquah, here, down the road 
from one of my district offices, the 
Eastside Fire Department evacuated 
apartment buildings that were in prox-
imity to a creek that had breached its 
banks and had water rushing through 
the parking lot and under the building. 
In Fall City, a town that has two 
roads in and out, there is a slow-mov-
ing landslide underneath one of those 
roads, and the road has started to sepa-
rate. Residents have been encouraged 
to evacuate so they are not at risk of 
being isolated in this town. 
As we continue to confront climate 
change, we need to holistically con-
sider our approaches to wilderness and 
public lands. Preservation of our public 
lands is just one tool at our disposal to 
help mitigate the impacts of flooding. 
We need to let nature do what nature 
does best: soak up water and prevent 
land from moving and turning into a 
landslide or mudslide during a flooding 
event. 
Climate change science shows that 
our region will experience heavier, 
more intense rainfall and increased 
rain-on-snow events that will increase 
the risk of flooding. 
Comprehensive watershed level plan-
ning, from the headwaters in wild and 
public lands all the way down to our 
towns and cities, is critical if we are 
going to address the myriad challenges 
facing so many of our communities, 
from flooding to salmon habitat res-
toration, to expanding recreation and 
outdoor access. 
As we think on a watershed scale, 
wilderness areas in the Eighth Congres-
sional District and across the State 
help protect the headwaters of our wa-
tersheds. 
A little further downhill, we have 
collaborative groups working on active 
management to improve forest health; 
and in the lower watersheds, we have 
local governments, Tribes, and other 
stakeholders working on integrative 
approaches to reduce flood risks in our 
communities. 
As our climate changes, we are going 
to see a marked increase in these 100- 
year events. Whether that is rain-
storms, snowstorms, or wildfires, it can 
all be better managed with a thought-
ful approach toward land use planning, 
management, and protection. 
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues 
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1500 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I ask 
unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition to the amendment, al-
though I am not opposed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from 
Idaho? 
There was no objection. 
The Acting Chair. The gentleman 
from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in support of this amendment. 
It is a simple study. We don’t know 
what the cost is, but I want to use that 
comment to correct myself previously. 
I said that the Federal Government is 
$2.3 trillion in debt. I was off by a dec-
imal there. It is over $23 trillion. 
Wilderness areas are supposed to be 
‘‘untrammeled by man, where man 
himself is a visitor who does not re-
main.’’ 
It is true that wildfires in wilderness 
areas definitely increase flood risk, and 
perhaps that points out an underlying 
flaw in the underlying bill, of course, 
and that is that there are wilderness 
areas too close to where residences are. 
But, again, the study is okay. The 
amendment is okay. I think it does 
identify one of the 992 flaws in this un-
derlying bill, which is that wilderness 
is too close to residential areas. 
And that 992, Mr. Chairman, is an es-
timate. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, I ap-
preciate the support of my colleague. 
He is absolutely right that wildfires do 
increase the risk of landslides and 
flooding later down the line. We forget 
about that part, what happens when 
the rain hits that previously scorched 
earth. 
I am thrilled to present this amend-
ment to have a study to protect our 
city urban areas in times of flood, and 
I appreciate the support of my col-
league. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
SCHRIER). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chair, I move 
that the Committee do now rise. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. 
SCHRIER) having assumed the chair, 
Mr. CUELLAR, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state

mittee, having had under consideration 
the bill (H.R. 2546) to designate certain

Ms. PRESSLEY changed her vote 
from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ 
So the amendment was rejected. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CLAY). There 
being no further amendments, under 
the rule, the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR) having assumed the chair, 
Mr. CLAY, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration 
the bill (H.R. 2546) to designate certain 
lands in the State of Colorado as com-
ponents of the National Wilderness 
Preservation System, and for other 
purposes, and, pursuant to House Reso-
lution 844, reported the bill, as amend-
ed by that resolution, back to the 
House with sundry further amend-
ments adopted in the Committee of the 
Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
further amendment reported from the 
Committee of the Whole? 
If not, the Chair will put them en 
gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Yes, in its current 
form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. McClintock moves to recommit the 
bill H.R. 2546 to the Committee on Natural 
Resources with instructions to report the 
same back to the House forthwith with the 
following amendment: 
Page 234, after line 21, insert the following 
(and redesignate subsequent provisions ac-
cordingly): 
TITLE VII—PROTECTING LIFE, PROPERTY, 
AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM WILDFIRE 
SEC. 701. PROTECTING LIFE, PROPERTY, AND 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
FROM 
WILD-
FIRE. 
In addition to any other authority pro-
vided in this Act, mechanical wildfire miti-
gation shall be allowed in wilderness areas 
designated under this Act to protect life, 
property, or the environment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes 
in support of his motion. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the 
question presented in this amendment 
comes down to this: Are we willing to 
protect our wilderness areas from cata-
strophic wildfire or are we content to 
stand by and watch them burn? 
The Wilderness Act of 1964 designates 
lands, ‘‘for the use and enjoyment of 
the American people in such manner as 
will leave them unimpaired for future 
use and enjoyment as wilderness.’’ 
Now, that is important because noth-
ing impairs the future use and enjoy-
ment of our wilderness areas more than 
catastrophic fire. 
Our pledge in the Wilderness Act is 
to, ‘‘provide for the protection of these 
areas.’’ To provide for the protection of 
these areas. 
Look at America’s wilderness areas 
today, it is heartbreaking. We have ut-
terly failed to protect them from the 
scourge of wildfire that is now con-
suming them. 
An untended forest is no different 
than an untended garden. It will grow 
and grow until it chokes itself to 
death, and as it becomes morbidly 
overgrown, it falls victim to disease, 
pestilence, drought, and ultimately 
catastrophic wildfire that incinerates 
everything in its path. 
Once a forest is cremated, scrub 
brush takes over, and the forest won’t 
regrow for a century or more, denying 
multiple generations of Americans the 
use and enjoyment that the Wilderness 
Act promises. And then the process of 
destruction will begin again. 
Why? Because we have made it all 
but impossible for forest managers to 
protect these habitats by removing ex-
cess timber before it can choke off the 
forest. 
Without 
special 
permitting, 
land managers are restricted to hand-
saws and axes, which consigns our wil-
derness forests to a policy of benign ne-
glect even as they die before our eyes 
and await the inevitable wildfire. 
And even when the conflagration is 
ravaging the forest, permission to use 
mechanized equipment to fight the 
fires in wilderness areas is often dif-
ficult and time consuming. Today’s Pa-
netta amendment does nothing to 
change this dangerous situation. 
The 2019 Decker fire in Colorado 
began in the Sangre de Cristo wilder-
ness where benign neglect had already 
decimated the forest. Eighty percent of 
the trees had already perished in the 
overcrowded 
conditions 
that 
made 
them vulnerable to pestilence and

drought. And when the fire came, fire-
fighters were held back due to the wil-
derness designation until the fire lit-
erally exploded. The same tale is told 
over and over again throughout our na-
tional lands. 
There are currently 111 million acres 
of Federal land designated as wilder-
ness. That is about the size of Cali-
fornia. This bill would add 1.5 million 
more. That is the size of Delaware and 
half of Rhode Island combined, much of 
it in areas where the Federal land man-
agers are warning us that it is not suit-
able for wilderness designation and it 
is opposed by local governments be-
cause of the proximity to towns, 
homes, and property. 
My amendment simply allows for 
mechanized wildfire mitigation; that 
is, something more than handsaws and 
axes for the express and sole purpose of 
protecting life, property, or the envi-
ronment in these newly created wilder-
ness areas under this bill. 
This isn’t a new policy. There are 29 
instances where similar active manage-
ment activities are already written 
into specific wilderness designations. 
This amendment would be the 30th 
time we have done so. 
When Republicans were in the major-
ity, we set three objectives for our Fed-
eral lands: To restore public access to 
them; to restore good management to 
them; and to restore the Federal Gov-
ernment as a good neighbor to the 
communities 
directly 
impacted 
by 
them. 
This bill reverses those objectives set 
by House Republicans. Instead of re-
storing public access to public lands, 
the Democrats would restrict it. In-
stead of restoring good management to 
the public lands, the Democrats inter-
fere with it. And instead of restoring 
the Federal Government as a good 
neighbor to those communities im-
pacted by the public lands, the Demo-
crats give those communities the fin-
ger. 
But mark these words: If these wil-
derness restrictions are imposed on 
acreage near people’s homes, it is only 
a matter of time until the forest suc-
cumbs to neglect and the inevitable 
cycle of overcrowding, death, and fire. 
In the aftermath, people will have the 
right to ask why their elected rep-
resentatives refused to protect them, 
their families, their homes and their 
forests when they had the chance to do 
so today to allow our Nation’s foresters 
to do their jobs and care for this pre-
cious resource. 
At this moment my Democratic col-
leagues, remember, only you can pre-
vent forest fires. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to the motion to 
recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Colorado is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, this mo-
tion to recommit may sound innoc-
uous, but it truly is a wolf in sheep’s 
clothing, and let me tell you why. 
Our local agencies already have the 
ability to fight fires if they need to in 
wilderness areas. There is no provision 
in the Wilderness Act that says they 
can only use axes or nonmechanical 
items, none. 
They keep saying this all day, and I 
don’t know why. It is simply not true. 
What this amendment would do is it 
would give some amorphous entity the 
ability to use mechanical means when-
ever they thought necessary, poten-
tially usurping the right of local gov-
ernments. 
And also, as the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) pointed 
out, the local areas, the management 
teams, already had the ability to fight 
fires how they wanted. And what is 
more, in the underlying bill, we say 
that. 
But just to make clear, just about ev-
erybody in this Chamber just voted for 
the Panetta amendment, which under-
scores that we can fight fires in wilder-
ness. 
But let’s talk about what this bill 
really is about. Let’s talk about it, be-
cause it is so important for our chil-
dren and our grandchildren, the future 
generations. 
Today, we have a bipartisan ability 
to preserve these special wild areas. It 
is a once-in-a-generation opportunity 
to preserve 1.4 million acres of wilder-
ness across the West for our genera-
tions to come. 
It will stimulate the economies of 
our States; it will encourage recre-
ation; it will encourage conservation; 
and it will take us a long way to our 
goal of preserving 30 percent of public 
lands by 2030 to start slowing down the 
changing of our climate. 
P.S., if we slow down the climate 
change, we slow down the forest fires, 
and everybody in this Chamber knows 
that. 
Look at the charts that we have of 
the areas in this bill. I want to show 
everybody these gorgeous areas: 
This first chart, one of the 35 areas in 
my Colorado Wilderness Act, the Dolo-
res Canyon River; 
The second chart, the Middle Fork 
Eel Wild and Scenic River in Mr. 
HUFFMAN’s Northwest California Wil-
derness, Recreation, and Working For-
est Act; 
The third chart, Dry Lakes Ridge in 
Mr. CARBAJAL’s Central Coast Heritage 
Protection Act. 
And, by the way, Mr. Speaker, you 
can see here where they had a fire, and 
you can see here what happened when 
that area remediated itself from the 
fire: beautiful wildflowers. 
The San Gabriel National Recreation 
Area waterways in Ms. CHU’s act, you 
can see the beautiful areas that are 
protected there. 
The Rim of the Valley in Mr. 
SCHIFF’s Rim of the Valley Corridor 
Preservation Act. These were sent to 
him by his constituents, who love these 
areas. 
And the Skokomish River in Mr. KIL-
MER’s Wild Olympics Wilderness and 
Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
Folks, this is what we are talking 
about. This is the legacy we are leaving 
our children. 
The Wilderness Act of 1964 says: 
Wilderness should be preserved as an area 
where the Earth and its community of life 
are untrammeled by man, where man himself 
is a visitor who does not remain. 
That is what we are talking about 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject this motion to recommit and 
vote 
‘‘yes’’ 
on 
this 
important 
groundbreaking bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- 
minute vote on the motion to recom-
mit will be followed by a 5-minute vote 
on the passage of the bill, if ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 199, nays 
215, not voting 15, as follows:

HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that when the 
House adjourns today, it adjourn to 
meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Colorado? 
There was no objection.

SUPPORTING ERA RESOLUTION 
(Ms. FRANKEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
FRANKEL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of the resolu-
tion to remove the arbitrary deadline 
for ratification of the equal rights 
amendment, which is designed to end 
the legal distinctions between men and 
women. 
Madam Speaker, signed in 1776, the 
Declaration of Independence states: 
‘‘All men are created equal.’’ Really? 
Following the birth of our Nation, it 
took women 144 years to secure the 
right to vote and even longer for 
women of color. It took 187 years to be 
promised equal pay, 197 years to get re-
productive rights, and 198 years to get 
a credit card or buy a home. 
Yet, Madam Speaker, the women in 
this country are still fighting for 
equality. Madam Speaker, we are tired 
of waiting. 
f 
RECOGNIZING FIFTH CORPS AT 
FORT KNOX 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Fort Knox. 
Yesterday, the U.S. Army selected 
Fort Knox as a new corps headquarters 
called V Corps. V Corps will bring over 
600 soldiers and their families to Ken-
tucky. 
I like to say that Fort Knox has the 
assets and the attitude for this new 
corps. The assets are the training 
grounds, housing, schools, and other 
resources that V Corps will be able to 
use when they arrive in the fall. The 
attitude is that of Fort Knox and the 
surrounding communities. 
Kentucky is a great place to be a sol-
dier, and I know that the Common-
wealth will welcome these soldiers and 
their families with open arms. 
I want to thank Senate Leader 
MCCONNELL for his steadfast leadership 
in helping Fort Knox get selected for 
the new V Corps. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with Fort Knox, the 
Department of Defense, and the U.S. 
Army. 
PENN STATE IS IMPORTANT 
NATIONAL RESOURCE 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I toured Penn State University 
Park campus located in Pennsylvania’s 
12th Congressional District. 
During that time, I had the oppor-
tunity to speak with students, staff, 
and faculty about ongoing projects and 
why they are proud to be part of an 
internationally sought-after education 
program. 
Penn State University was founded 
as a land grant university, meaning its 
mission is to serve the public, espe-
cially the people of Pennsylvania. 
After my tour of the campus and see-
ing their impressive research facilities, 
I can say with confidence that Penn 
State remains focused on that original 
mission. Whether it is helping the agri-
culture community with ag extensions 
or working on important defense-re-
lated research for the Federal Govern-
ment, Penn State is an important 
State and national resource. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with Penn State in carrying out its 
public mission and remaining a pre-
mier national institution. 
f 
ALLOW TREASURY TO WAIVE 
VOTING AUTHORITY 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to bring attention 
to a bill that I will be introducing this 
week. 
My legislation allows the Secretary 
of the Treasury to waive voting au-
thority for the international financial 
institutions on a case-by-case basis. 
The World Bank and the Inter-
national Monetary Fund receive U.S. 
funding and are subject to legislative 
oversight, which often dictates by a 
mandate what projects and policies 
they can endorse. 
For example, when the World Bank 
takes a vote to approve a lending 
project, the United States may have to 
abstain or vote against it due to the 
parameters put forward by a mandate 
from Congress. Even further, Congress 
keeps adding to the mandates and has 
never tried to streamline them, result-
ing in mandates that are antiquated 
and can actually conflict with one an-
other. 
As a result, the Financial Services 
Committee has increasingly come to a 
bipartisan consensus that new man-
dates should have waiver authority and 
sunset clauses. 
This legislation would allow the 
Treasury Secretary to waive a mandate 
and be able to properly vote on a fi-
nancing, subject to a written report as 
to why to Congress. This means more 
flexibility to pursue our national inter-
ests, but also strong accountability to 
Congress. 
f 
COME TOGETHER TO SERVE THE 
PEOPLE 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the birthday of the 
great Abraham Lincoln, an attorney, a 
Congressman, and the 16th President of 
the United States. 
In this day and age, let us honor 
President Lincoln by remembering his 
words: ‘‘A house divided against itself 
cannot stand.’’ 
While these words rang true 3 years 
before the Civil War, they are just as 
true today, Madam Speaker. As we 
move past the cloud of impeachment, 
let us come together and remember 
why we are here in this Chamber: to 
serve the American people. That is why 
we are here. 
Let today be the day that we come 
together and serve the people of our 
great Nation in a way that would make 
Abraham Lincoln proud. 
f 
RAISING AWARENESS OF 
AMERICAN HEART MONTH 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to draw attention to American 
Heart Month, a topic that is extremely 
important yet also personal to me. 
Almost 10 years ago, I was diagnosed 
with severe three-vessel coronary ar-
tery disease, and I have since had 13 
stents placed in my heart. So while 
this is deeply personal to share, I also 
recognize the unique position that I 
have been given to raise awareness 
about cardiovascular health. 
Half of all Americans have at least 
one key risk factor: high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, or history of 
smoking. By changing our diets, avoid-
ing nicotine products, and exercising, 
roughly 83 percent of premature deaths 
from heart disease can be avoided. 
Along with annual checkups and pre-
scribed medicines, I urge all to remain 
alert to the symptoms of heart prob-
lems, including shortness of breath, 
heart palpitations, or numbness in the 
arms. 
Heart disease is currently the world’s 
leading cause of death, claiming 17.9 
million lives annually, yet it doesn’t 
have to be. 
With modern medicine, and by the 
grace of God, I am here today. So I 
urge everyone to take control of their 
heart health before it is too late.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, as a 
member of the Committee on Home-
land Security, I rise today to express 
my strong opposition to the New Way 
Forward Act, which would completely 
eliminate our Nation’s ability to con-
trol our borders and determine who en-
ters our country. 
It would cripple the efforts of our law 
enforcement officers to remove dan-
gerous criminals from our streets, and 
it would undermine the sacrifice that 
the men and women of law enforcement 
make every day. 
Additionally, the New Way Forward 
Act would encourage and open new 
pathways for convicted criminals to 
enter and remain in the United States. 
Meanwhile, conservative policies like 
building the wall and supporting law 
enforcement agencies reduced the num-
ber of apprehensions by almost 75 per-
cent since May and led to the seizure of 
more than 50,000 pounds of drugs across 
our southwest border. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to oppose the New Way For-
ward Act. 
f 
RECOGNIZING EGG HARBOR TOWN-
SHIP HIGH SCHOOL MOCK TRIAL 
TEAM 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to recognize the Egg Harbor 
Township High School’s mock trial 
team from south Jersey. 
Egg Harbor Township High School 
unseated 
reigning 
Atlantic 
County 
trial champion Mainland Regional in 
the county final. 
Led by coaches Michael Martirone, 
Trevor Zompa, and Dara Quattrone, 
the Egg Harbor mock trial team won 
for the first time in 9 years. 
Students take on roles of prosecu-
tors, defense attorneys, witnesses, and 
jurors before New Jersey judges and at-
torneys at the New Jersey Law Center. 
Egg Harbor’s team will now compete in 
the semifinals, with the final competi-
tion being in March. 
I am going to mention all of their 
names: Raza Abbas, Tyler Weller, Mad-
eline Coyle, Annette Diaz, Michael 
Donchey, 
Gabriela 
Garcia, 
Malini 
Gulati, Tasmiah Haque, Megan Herbin, 
Jason Hill, David Lee, Matthew Levine, 
Nicholas Seppy, Ethan Saul, Carina

Congratulations, and good luck. We

you. We are so unbelievably proud of 
you.

EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN 
(Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, in 1970 in this very 
Chamber the first African American 
woman elected to Congress, Shirley 
Chisholm, said: 
There is an unspoken assumption 
that women are different. Artificial 
distinctions between persons must be 
wiped out of the law. 
Congresswoman Chisholm was calling 
for the passage of the equal rights 
amendment. Fifty years later and a 
century after securing the right to 
vote, I stand before you, Madam Speak-
er, with the same call to action. 
I stand before you as a Member of the 
116th Congress with the greatest pro-
portion of women Members in our his-
tory and a female Speaker, but yet as 
a woman, my rights remain unpro-
tected in the Constitution. 
The 
majority 
of 
Americans 
are 
women, but yet our Constitution does 
not fully and explicitly include our 
mothers, 
daughters, 
grandmothers, 
aunts, and neighbors. 
Our Constitution is not just a found-
ing document. It is a foundational doc-
ument to equality under the law. It is 
time to reflect the truths that have be-
come self-evident, that all people are 
created equal. It is time to pass the 
equal rights amendment. 
f 
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about the importance of 
investing in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. And, in particular, to fix our bro-
ken and aging water delivery systems, 
not only in California but throughout 
the country. 
In California’s San Joaquin Valley, 
the availability of a clean and reliable 
water supply is absolutely essential for 
the foundation of our economy. Farm-
ers need water to feed the world, and 
life becomes obviously very difficult if 
residents don’t have a clean drinking 
water supply. 
The waterways that carry our water 
were built decades ago in California 
and throughout the country. 
Last week, I introduced legislation to 
fix two pieces of critical water infra-
structure, the Delta-Mendota Canal 
and the California Aqueduct, that were 
built decades ago. 
The Conveyance Capacity Correction 
Act will provide $400 million to fund 
these needed projects. This legislation 
is just one of the many tools we have 
that can fix the water system that we 
have; one of the water tools in our 
water toolbox. 
We need to invest in our water infra-
structure now for the future sustain-
ability of our State and the livelihood 
of our residents. 
Food is a national security item. 
THE PRESIDENT’S BUDGET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CRAIG). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PORTER) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, when 
Donald Trump was running for Presi-
dent, he promised that he would bal-
ance the budget, eliminate the national 
debt, and protect programs that sup-
port American families. 
He continues to promise to balance 
the budget, but his latest math is based 
on fantasy. The President’s budget cuts 
the programs that Americans rely on 
and those that Americans have in-
vested in in order to fund more tax 
cuts for the wealthy, a bigger defense 
budget, and an ineffective border wall. 
If it isn’t clear yet, the President 
failed to be truthful. He is putting spe-
cial interests above the health and 
safety of hardworking American fami-
lies. 
Our national debt is bigger than ever, 
and taxpayer dollars have been wasted 
paying for tax cuts that benefit the 
rich and powerful. 
Here is the stone-cold truth: Presi-
dent Trump is reneging on his promise 
to protect older Americans and those 
with disabilities. His proposed budget 
cuts billions from Social Security and 
Medicare. These drastic cuts and his 
failure to keep his word will devastate 
millions of Americans. 
Social Security has lifted millions of 
older Americans out of poverty, but 
the President doesn’t think it is nec-
essary to continue supporting our most 
vulnerable older Americans. 
The President would also slash the 
budget for the Administration for Com-
munity Living. Americans need this 
agency to support those who are aging 
and those who have disabilities, as well 
as their caregivers, so that they can 
age in place and live their best life 
every day of their lives. I have heard 
countless times from Orange County 
residents that they want the choice to 
grow older in their homes in our beau-
tiful community that they have spent 
much of their lives in. The President’s 
budget takes these choices away. 
Right now, our country is struggling 
to keep up with our global competitors. 
And apparently right now the Presi-
dent thinks this is a good time to gut 
funding for medical research and inno-
vation. 
The President wants to cut invest-
ments in medical research at the Na-
tional Institutes of Health that provide 
the pipeline for new cures and that 
spur innovation. 
The President wants to cut funding 
for the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the Health Resources and 
Services Administration, and the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration. These agencies 
ensure that there are qualified health 
professionals who can move new med-
ical discoveries into healthcare and 
public-health delivery, support Ameri-
cans while they are awaiting new

cures, and prevent them from getting 
sick in the first place. 
The President also wants to cut fund-
ing for the Food and Drug Administra-
tion and the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality. Americans need 
the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve new, safe, and effective treat-
ments and the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality to provide evi-
dence on what treatments work best, 
for whom, and in what circumstances. 
If you follow the President’s budget 
proposals over his years in office, 
Madam Speaker, you know that this is 
a pattern that just keeps repeating, be-
cause the President doesn’t care about 
securing healthcare for older Ameri-
cans, for children, or for everyday 
Americans, he doesn’t care about en-
suring that older Americans have a se-
cure and comfortable retirement. He 
doesn’t care that millions of Americans 
depend on these programs to survive. 
The cuts as proposed are untenable 
for America’s health and are a radical 
change from how we funded these pro-
grams in decades past. 
It is my responsibility as a Rep-
resentative to provide Federal funding 
in 2021 that aligns with our core values 
as a nation and that supports the 
American people, and I promise to put 
Orange County families first. Unlike 
the President, I will never break this 
longstanding promise to my constitu-
ents. 
The President’s budget shows willful 
ignorance of the climate crisis that is 
threatening our country’s natural re-
sources, our communities’ health, and 
our global prosperity. He proposes cuts 
to environmental protection programs 
that would only further exacerbate the 
worst effects of the climate change. 
Countries around the world are experi-
encing their warmest winters in his-
tory. Antarctica saw temperatures of 
65 degrees for the first time in history. 
We have watched Australia and the 
rain forests burn. We have watched our 
home State of California burn. We have 
seen communities devastated by hurri-
canes 
and 
other 
adverse 
weather 
caused by climate change. The Presi-
dent’s proposed budget would slash the 
budget for the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency by 26 percent and cut in 
half funding for energy research and 
development. This would gut critical 
programs like the Land & Water Con-
servation Fund and tax credits for elec-
tric vehicles by millions of dollars 
each. 
People are dying, entire species are 
on the verge of extinction, and commu-
nities have been destroyed; but the 
President wants to devastate bipar-
tisan programs established to protect 
our natural resources, our commu-
nities, and our planet. 
Who is this budget for? 
Who are these proposals for? 
The oil industry, special interests, 
and the few in this world who gain 
more from harming our planet than 
from supporting it. This budget is not 
for Californians, and it is not for Or-
ange County families. 
As a mother of three, I fear for the 
world my children will grow up in, and 
I cannot stand by and let this Presi-
dent destroy programs that would pro-
tect it. 
On the topic of our children’s future, 
I am disgusted by the President’s deci-
sion to cut funding for public education 
while providing yet another tax break 
for the wealthy and largest corpora-
tions. The President’s proposal is an 
outright attack on our public schools 
which are a real point of pride in the 
45th Congressional District. 
To make matters worse, the budget 
would make higher education less af-
fordable and less accessible than it al-
ready is for too many students. The 
budget makes a $170 billion cut to stu-
dent loan programs over the next 10 
years. 
What does this mean for our college 
students? 
Increased costs for new students be-
cause subsidized student loans would 
be eliminated, difficulty getting jobs 
on campus because of cuts to funding 
for Federal workstudy, and difficulty 
repaying loans because of the elimi-
nation of the Public Service Loan For-
giveness Program. This program is 
based on a simple premise that dedi-
cating yourself to making this country 
better by responding to emergencies, 
by educating our students, and by pro-
viding care for the sick is an honorable 
and deeply needed service. 
These are just some of the many pro-
fessions performed by those who pursue 
a career in the public sector. By elimi-
nating the Public Service Loan For-
giveness 
Program, 
the 
President 
breaks our promise to our first re-
sponders, our teachers, and our nurses. 
These borrowers have tirelessly com-
mitted themselves to improving our 
communities, and we must keep our 
commitment to them. 
Despite being in the middle of a his-
toric affordable housing crisis which 
we feel acutely in Orange County, 
President Trump wants to make dra-
matic cuts to the housing and commu-
nity development programs that serve 
those in need. The proposal slashes 
funding for the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development by 15 percent. 
That is $8.6 billion. That money is com-
ing out of essential housing assistance 
programs that lift up our communities. 
In a State like California where the af-
fordable housing crisis hits especially 
hard, these cuts will hurt thousands of 
families who rely on them to make 
ends meet. 
In California, a minimum wage work-
er would have to work 116 hours a week 
to afford a two-bedroom apartment or 
have the good fortune to find a job that 
pays $35 an hour. But in my district of 
Orange County, make that $39 per 
hour, or $80,000 per year. The median 
cost for a single-family home in Orange 
County is over $800,000. 
Do we want to live in a country 
where only millionaires can afford 
shelter? 
Until we address the severe lack of 
affordable housing in America, we will 
need programs like community block 
grants and the HOME Investment Part-
nerships Program to help families. 
Those funds support affordable housing 
for low- and moderate-income families, 
and the President’s budget completely 
eliminates them. His proposal would, 
quite literally, leave families out in 
the cold. Taking a chunk out of HUD’s 
budget when home and rental prices 
are hitting new highs across the coun-
try is irresponsible and, frankly, cruel. 
President Trump says he is for our 
business owners, but he clearly means 
mega 
corporations—Big 
Oil, 
Big 
Pharma, and Wall Street banks—be-
cause his budget eliminates funding for 
the Economic Development Adminis-
tration’s grant program, and it cuts 
the Small Business Administration by 
11 percent. This budget would harm 
U.S. innovation and growth and hurt 
small business owners who are the 
backbone of our economy. 
President Trump also wants to cut 
our foreign aid budget by over 20 per-
cent. That money is about keeping 
Americans safe and keeping us out of 
never-ending wars. Former Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral 
Mike Mullen, raised similar concerns 
earlier this week: ‘‘The more we cut 
the international affairs budget, the 
higher the risk for longer and deadlier 
military operations.’’ 
The President’s budget puts Ameri-
cans and our military at risk, rather 
than funding foreign aid that keeps us 
safe and secure. 
We have a responsibility as elected 
officials to be good stewards of working 
Americans’ hard-earned dollars, and 
that means funding programs to get 
families the help that they need, pro-
grams that invest in our children, and 
priorities that keep us safe. Giveaways 
to special interests and wasted dollars 
on proposals not grounded in evidence 
are slaps in the face of our hard-
working taxpayers. 
If this budget is a reflection of the 
President’s values and of his goals and 
vision for our country, then I am afraid 
of what policies may come out of this 
White House next. 
I constantly seek opportunities to 
work with my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, and I look for chances 
to work with this President as well. 
But I cannot and I will not support gut-
ting the programs that serve our fami-
lies and our communities. 
It is Congress’ responsibility to make 
sure that we spend taxpayer dollars 
wisely on programs that support eco-
nomic growth rather than things that 
line the pockets of special interests 
and hurt our future. 
Congress was given the power of the 
purse as part of a system of checks and 
balances on the President’s power, and 
it is our responsibility on both sides of 
the aisle to fight for a real budget 
grounded in our values and a budget 
that works for the families and the 
American people that we represent. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB).

H1116 
February 12, 2020 
b 1730 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PORTER), my incredible colleague who 
co-chairs the Special Order within the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus. I do 
appreciate her continued leadership in 
fighting for families all across the 
country. 
One of the things that we need to re-
alize is this is a destructive and irra-
tional budget by the current adminis-
tration, and we want to wonder why. 
This is a reflection—very much so— 
of the values within this administra-
tion. It is also showing that we are 
going to leave working-class folks and 
anyone who needs access to food, 
healthcare, housing, clean air, and re-
lief from flooding behind. 
And we wonder: Why did this come 
about? Well, like folks in my district 
would say: Let’s go back and figure out 
who is part of the administration. 
Right now, under the current Trump 
administration, a coal lobbyist runs 
the EPA; a pharmaceutical executive 
runs Health and Human Services; an 
oil lobbyist runs the Department of the 
Interior; another lobbyist runs DOD, 
the Department of Defense; a Verizon 
lawyer runs the Federal Communica-
tions Commission; a Goldman Sachs 
executive runs Treasury; a private eq-
uity kingpin runs Commerce; a billion-
aire Amway heiress runs the Depart-
ment of Education. 
So what you have here is a reflection 
of those values, those folks who are 
completely 
disconnected 
from 
the 
American people. These folks are mil-
lionaires—some may be even billion-
aires—who do not understand the day- 
to-day challenges that our folks are 
facing. 
Madam Speaker, I represent the third 
poorest congressional district in the 13 
District Strong, where we have, in 
some areas, chronic poverty, but also 
lack of access to food. We also face 
that we are frontline communities of 
what doing nothing looks like on cli-
mate change. We also house the worst 
ZIP Code in the State of Michigan— 
48217. 
Madam Speaker, look at the budget 
itself. Just gloss over it. You are talk-
ing about $1.4 trillion in tax give-
aways—$1.7 billion in cuts just in the 
Army Corps of Engineers, where two of 
my communities right now are lit-
erally facing flooding of homes that 
they need the Army Corps of Engineers 
to be able to address, from commu-
nities in Dearborn Heights and all 
along the east side of Detroit. 
Madam Speaker, we have $920 billion 
in Medicaid cuts, healthcare to our 
most vulnerable, many of them, again, 
family members and those who have to 
take care of our children. 
Madam Speaker, a 26 percent cut to 
the EPA. We, right now, in the city of 
Detroit and throughout Wayne County, 
we don’t even meet sulfur dioxide 
standards, right now, under the Clean 
Air Act. We suffer every single day. In 
one of my ZIP Codes, we have three 
times higher asthma hospitalization 
among adults. 
We need to push back on these cuts 
that, again, reflect on who is running 
this administration versus a reflection 
of the American people and their needs. 
It 
directly 
eliminates 
affordable 
housing programs within HUD. Not 
only is the food assistance being cut, 
the $181 billion in food assistance, they 
are going and proceeding on to create a 
culture that says that working folks, 
working-class residents, our most vul-
nerable, seniors, the vulnerable com-
munities—like our mothers and others 
who are taking care of their families— 
have to be left behind while we give 
cuts to the wealthy and to corpora-
tions. 
And so it is really critically impor-
tant the American people wake up and 
understand who is running our govern-
ment right now, because, right now, 
our government is not about people. 
This budget is a reflection of those val-
ues that are going to be people versus 
profit, and this budget is very clear: 
Our people are not coming first. And, 
from a community, again, that is a 
frontline community that always gets 
left behind—if it is not around edu-
cation funding, environmental funding 
to housing funding to food assistance, 
we are, again, the frontline commu-
nities of what doing nothing looks like. 
Madam Speaker, this budget is wrong 
for our country. It is destructive, and 
it is something that we need to be able 
to push back together on in a bipar-
tisan way. 
I thank my colleague, again, for this 
opportunity to express and be a voice 
for many of my residents back home in 
13 District Strong. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. COSTA). 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from California for 
the good work that she does on behalf 
of her constituents, and I appreciate 
the opportunity to make comments 
that are important investments that 
we should be making in our infrastruc-
ture for all Americans. 
The President, when he ran for office, 
talked about his willingness to invest 
in America’s infrastructure. Sadly, we 
have seen little follow-through on be-
half of the administration to do just 
that. 
America was built over decades and 
generations on Americans willing to 
invest in our infrastructure. Clearly, 
today, we are living off the invest-
ments our parents and grandparents 
made a generation or two ago. 
In California, but throughout the 
country, that includes fixing our aging 
water systems, our transportation sys-
tems, and investing in our school sites. 
In my home in the San Joaquin Valley, 
the development of water over the last 
100 years has allowed deserts to bloom. 
A reliable water supply is a founda-
tion for any economy. Farmers need 
water to feed the world. We say, 
‘‘where water flows, food grows,’’ and 
life 
becomes 
increasingly 
difficult 
when we have literally hundreds and 
thousands of Californians and else-
where around the country in which 
communities that are small, that are 
not incorporated, cannot meet or com-
ply with clean drinking water stand-
ards either by the State or by the Fed-
eral Government. That is just wrong. 
The richest country in the world, and 
yet we have communities that don’t 
meet clean drinking water standards? 
We know that many of these water 
systems were built decades ago. Cali-
fornia now has doubled its population. 
We need to invest. 
Madam Speaker, this last week, I in-
troduced legislation for critical water 
infrastructure in parts of my district, 
the west side of the San Joaquin Val-
ley, the Delta-Mendota Canal that has 
lost 15 to 20 percent of its capacity. 
The California Aqueduct that not 
only brings water from the north to the 
San Joaquin Valley but to Los Angeles 
as a critical supply of those water 
needs for Los Angelenos, these canals 
supply water to tens of millions of peo-
ple, and also to the Santa Clara Valley 
Water, the home of what? Silicon Val-
ley. 
The legislation that I introduced, the 
Conveyance Capacity Correction Act, 
will provide $400 million to fund these 
needed repairs. This is just one piece of 
legislation to address the many tools 
in our water toolbox in California’s 
aging water system, but we need to in-
vest now in our water infrastructure. 
We also need to invest now in our 
transportation system. The roads that 
were built in California and the high-
ways, the inner city and transit sys-
tems and our air transportation have 
really, post-World War II, been the rea-
son why California has become the 
Golden State. And we, again, are living 
off those investments our 
parents 
made. We need to make the same kinds 
of investments. 
When the President talks about $1 
trillion of investment across America, 
that is wonderful, and our Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure 
has sought where those needs should be 
felt. But to do that, you have to put up 
real money to match local, State dol-
lars with Federal money. 
We haven’t really provided any new 
Federal sources of funding since the 
1990s; and it is absolutely essential if 
we are going to have this sort of 21st 
century system of transportation that 
is intermodal, that is interconnected, 
that will be provided for people for 
work, for pleasure, and for a host of 
purposes to get from point A to point 
B, to ensure that they can do it safely, 
in a way that makes the quality of life 
absolutely better. 
So those are the challenges we face. 
We are working to put an infrastruc-
ture package together that will fund 
our roads and highways, our transit 
systems, our inner-city rail systems 
that include high-speed rail. 
We are building high-speed rail in 
California, and I have introduced legis-
lation that will provide money for fast

trains throughout the country, as well 
as in California. We are under con-
struction now. 
But that is one part of an overall 
connected system that makes sure that 
our air transportation, that our inner- 
city transportation and our roads and 
highways are connected as we see in 
Europe and in other parts of the world. 
That is the challenge. 
Madam Speaker, I think, if we can 
come together in a bipartisan fashion 
as we have done traditionally, we can 
overcome these challenges and invest 
in ways that do what? Provide good- 
paying jobs; because when you invest 
in the infrastructure—whether it is our 
water, 
our 
transportation, 
our 
schools—we are investing in Ameri-
cans, and those create the good-paying 
jobs that raise all boats for working 
people. And, really, that is what we are 
talking about here when we talk about 
investing: investing for working peo-
ple, for all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Orange County for all of 
her good work. 
FREEDOM OF RELIGION 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, the 
administration’s 
Muslim 
ban 
has 
ripped families apart. Orange County 
families have endured this Muslim ban 
for 3 long years; yet, the President has 
doubled down, making it so much 
worse. 
Make no mistake, this policy is based 
on hate. It is based upon dividing us 
with fear. 
President Trump showed hostility to 
Muslims 
during 
his 
campaign. 
He 
called for a ‘‘total and complete shut-
down of Muslims entering the United 
States.’’ 
Just 7 days into office, the President 
signed the first version of the Muslim 
ban. This was never about national se-
curity. It was about anti-Muslim hate 
and discrimination. 
The families in my community, as 
well as families across the United 
States, are suffering. Families in my 
district are being torn apart by the 
ban. It is separating husbands from 
wives, mothers from children, and 
adults from their dying parents. 
Let me be clear: No individual or 
family should be discriminated against 
based on their religious beliefs. It is 
why I backed the Freedom of Religion 
Act, which would prohibit religious dis-
crimination in our immigration system 
and protect Americans of all faiths— 
not just Muslim Americans. 
I am proud that so many Americans 
have stood together to protest the ad-
ministration’s Muslim ban, to push 
back and to vote in Representatives 
like me who will fight discrimination. 
Today, because the American people 
made their voices heard, the House of 
Representatives began the process to 
repeal this shameful ban. I am proud to 
be a backer of that legislation, the NO 
BAN Act, and I will always support and 
celebrate the vibrant Muslim commu-
nity in Orange County. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
THE TALE OF TWO CITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RUSH) is recognized for the 
remainder of the hour as the designee 
of the majority leader. 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PORTER) for yielding the balance of the 
hour, of her time, to me. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 40 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to sound the alarm among the 
shrinking Black population in cities 
across the U.S. According to a recent 
study by the University of Illinois at 
Chicago, the city of Chicago lost 350,000 
Black residents between 1980 and 2016. 
Madam Speaker, this is what I call 
‘‘Black 
exodus’’—not 
exodus, 
but 
‘‘Black exodus.’’ This intense ‘‘Black 
exodus’’ is a result of decades of dis-
investment 
and 
disenfranchisement. 
Sadly, the city of Chicago that so 
many African Americans looked to as a 
beacon of hope during the great migra-
tion has often failed to invest in its 
Black population. 
The economic, cultural, and political 
impact of Chicago’s Black community 
on our Nation has been immense: Louis 
Armstrong’s groundbreaking jazz ema-
nated from Chicago, Thomas Dorsey’s 
gospel rose up from Chicago, and 
Muddy Waters’ blues all came about in 
Chicago. 
b 1745 
Since 1945, until recently, the iconic 
Ebony Magazine, along with its sister 
magazine, JET magazine, chronicled 
Black civic and social life in Chicago 
and across the Nation. 
The first African American President 
of the United States began his political 
career on Chicago’s South Side. 
The story of Black Chicago is one of 
power and perseverance, often in the 
face of extreme resistance and resound-
ing prejudice. 
The UIC study stated that a lack of 
well-paying jobs and affordable housing 
are two main factors that have driven 
the decline in Chicago’s Black popu-
lation. The alarming statistics pre-
sented in this study are proof that the 
consequences of the predatory and prej-
udiced practices from the past are still 
present with us and still being felt at 
this very hour. 
Madam Speaker, the practice of red-
lining was invented, first occurred, in 
Chicago. 
Last September, I highlighted a 
study from Duke University that stat-
ed that redlining, the practice of re-
stricting the availability of conven-
tional mortgage loans in certain neigh-
borhoods based on their racial makeup, 
stole up to $4 billion from Chicago’s 
Black community during the 1950s and 
1960s. Chicago’s Black community was 
ripped off up to $4 billion because of 
redlining in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Now, some of the neighborhoods that 
African Americans were initially sys-
tematically forced into are, all of a 
sudden, 
quickly 
developing, 
which 
threatens to push out families who 
have lived there for generations. 
Redlining is being followed by the 
gentrifying that is occurring in Chi-
cago. 
Despite the creation, Madam Speak-
er, of 65,000 new jobs in downtown Chi-
cago between 2010 and 2015, Chicago’s 
predominantly Black communities saw 
a net reduction of 1,500 jobs. While 
65,000 jobs in the downtown area in-
creased, 1,500 jobs in Chicago were de-
creased from the Black community. 
Compounding, Madam Speaker, this 
reduction is the fact that over 700,000 
jobs are located within 30 minutes of 
Chicago’s downtown, in the predomi-
nantly White North Side of Chicago, 
but just 60,000 jobs are located within 
30 minutes of the South Side of Chi-
cago. 
Chicago is a tale of two cities. It al-
ways was and currently remains the 
tale of two cities: the wealthy, afflu-
ent, upper-middle-class North Side, and 
the poor, devastated communities on 
the South and the West Sides, both 
within 30 minutes of Chicago’s down-
town area. 
Many Black Chicagoans who reside 
on the South Side are thus deprived of 
the opportunity to earn a living in or 
near the community that they reside 
in. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these 
startling 
trends are certainly not confined or re-
stricted just to Chicago or even to the 
Midwest. In fact, Madam Speaker, we 
can look right here in our Nation’s 
Capital, the city of Washington, D.C., 
for our next example. 
A 
recent 
Georgetown 
University 
study found that African Americans 
accounted for over 70 percent of the 
District’s population in 1970. By the 
year 2015, African Americans were just 
48.3 percent of the District’s popu-
lation, from 70 percent to less than 50 
percent in just a few years. 
Georgetown’s findings were strik-
ingly similar to the findings at the 
University of Illinois at Chicago. Soar-
ing housing prices and a diminished job 
market for those who were without a 
bachelor’s degree pushed longtime resi-
dents out of our Nation’s Capital, and 
they pushed out longtime residents in 
Chicago as well. 
Madam Speaker, we don’t look just 
at Chicago or our Nation’s Capital. 
Let’s look south to see the same trou-
bling trend. 
Austin, Texas, Madam Speaker, is a 
modern-day boomtown whose popu-
lation grew by 20 percent between 2000 
and 2010, a boomtown in Austin, Texas. 
During this same period, its African 
American population fell by over 5 per-
cent. 
A 2014 survey from the University of 
Texas at Austin found that 26 percent 
of African Americans who moved out 
and left Austin did so because the city 
had 
gotten 
too 
expensive.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1118 
February 12, 2020 
Gentrification has forced many long- 
term residents of color to leave their 
neighborhoods due to increased hous-
ing costs. 
It is essential that this Congress en-
sures that neighborhood development 
does not force out those families who 
have often called these very same 
neighborhoods home for many past 
generations. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I am so 
proud to have joined with Congressman 
HANK JOHNSON in introducing H.R. 4999, 
the Opportunity Zone Fairness and In-
clusion Act. This bill seeks to mitigate 
the inequities that are often brought 
on by rapid neighborhood development. 
The opportunity zone program was 
intended to incentivize investment in 
underserved communities. Currently, 
Madam Speaker, this same investment 
program, this same opportunity zone 
program, lacks mechanisms to ensure 
that the residents of these neighbor-
hoods benefit from this increased in-
vestment. 
By mandating that opportunity zone 
funds establish investment and advi-
sory boards that include members of 
targeted communities, H.R. 4999 would 
ensure greater local involvement in op-
portunity zone projects. 
H.R. 4999 would also establish re-
quirements for small and minority 
business involvement in those very 
same critical opportunity zone funds. I 
encourage all of my colleagues in this 
Congress to join me in supporting H.R. 
4999. 
Madam Speaker, going forward, we 
must develop policies with an eye on 
rectifying the prejudices and the injus-
tices of the past. That means bringing 
affordable housing, stable and well- 
paying jobs, and vibrant and robust 
businesses to communities that have 
been denied these opportunities for far 
too long, including my beloved home-
town, the city of Chicago. 
Merely pushing development without 
a firm focus on equity would only per-
petuate the discriminatory policies of 
the past. 
In partnership with State and local 
governments, this Congress and future 
Congresses 
can 
help 
preserve 
and 
strengthen the vibrant, pioneering, and 
groundbreaking Black communities in 
places like Chicago, Illinois, and, more 
broadly, in urban areas throughout our 
great Nation. 
Madam Speaker, this Congress can do 
nothing more or nothing less than help 
American citizens regain a footing in 
their communities, in their neighbor-
hoods, by ensuring that fair housing is 
available, affordable housing is avail-
able, economic viability and vitality 
with increased businesses are available, 
and that jobs are created in these com-
munities. 
Let us turn this page to a more pro-
ductive and progressive future and 
close the book on the precedential and 
bad disinvesting past. 
Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

E-VERIFY IS THE SOLUTION TO 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. YOHO) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I want 
to talk about immigration, more im-
portantly, a guest worker program for 
agriculture that will solve this di-
lemma. 
The reason we have an immigration 
issue in this country is because this 
body has failed to act in the last 30 
years. It is something that the Amer-
ican population shouldn’t have to go 
through and the immigrants shouldn’t 
have to go through because there are 
simple solutions out there. But, unfor-
tunately, in this body, politics gets 
played and prevents that from hap-
pening. 
E-Verify is the solution to illegal im-
migration. E-Verify stands for an elec-
tronic verification system that verifies 
one’s legal identification. 
The ID number most commonly used 
for employment is a person’s Social Se-
curity number. This ID number is used 
at an employee’s place of employment, 
and the employer uses this number to 
validate the identification number of 
the employee. 
There are some major concerns and 
shortfalls with relying on a Social Se-
curity number for identification, as we 
will explain below. 
Using a Social Security number sets 
the system up for fraud and does noth-
ing to verify the legal status of an indi-
vidual. 
Other numbers can be used for identi-
fication purposes for employment, but 
there does not yet exist a universally 
accepted ID number or an adequate 
program for a non-U.S. citizen to use 
or to enroll into a national E-Verify 
system. 
The problem with using a Social Se-
curity number is often they are used by 
multiple persons fraudulently at the 
same time and do not provide positive 
identification of the person using that 
specific number. 
For instance, in my discussions with 
DHS E-Verify personnel, the people 
who run that program say they can 
verify a Social Security number as le-
gitimate within seconds. This is some-
thing that is free to the employer. So 
they can run a Social Security number 
and verify it within seconds, but they 
cannot verify if the person using that 
number is, in fact, the actual person 
that the unique Social Security num-
ber was assigned to. 
DHS has said that, in many in-
stances, a Social Security number will 
be verified as real, yet it will show up 
in 10 different locations around the 
country at the same time. Therefore, 
all E-Verify is doing is verifying a le-
gitimate Social Security number, not 
whether an individual is permitted to 
work here legally or if that person is 
the legitimate holder of that Social Se-
curity number. 
Another issue with using a Social Se-
curity number for non-U.S. citizens is 
that somehow it denotes citizenship, 
and so people think, if they have a So-
cial Security number, that the person 
using it is a U.S. citizen. 
A Social Security number, in what 
we are promoting and advocating for, 
should be reserved for and used only by 
U.S. citizens. All others should receive 
a different form of identification. 
There is a solution. What I propose is 
to create a standardized E-Verify sys-
tem used universally around the coun-
try so all employers can verify the 
legal status and identity of an em-
ployee. This protects the employer 
from hiring illegal individuals, as well 
as providing the migrant employee 
legal 
documentation, 
identification, 
and permission to be in the country to 
work. 
The solution is a guest worker identi-
fication card. This card can be referred 
to as the GWIC. The GWIC will have a 
unique 15-digit identification number 
issued to each unique individual. The 
GWIC, or guest worker identification 
card, will also have a photo of the indi-
vidual on the front and a smart chip 
embedded in it. 
The smart chip will have embedded 
within it biosecurity information be-
longing to that cardholder. The rec-
ommended 
biosecurity 
information 
would be facial recognition, finger-
prints, retinal scans, possibly blood 
type and DNA. Other things that have 
been proposed are personal questions 
only the cardholder would know, and 
they could customize their individual, 
unique card to have this information 
included in the encrypted technology. 
This 
information 
would 
only 
be 
available to DHS or government agen-
cies. An employer could not get into 
this because they would be locked out 
of that information. 
The current sectors being proposed in 
the U.S. Congress to be able to use this 
program are agriculture, hospitality, 
and construction. These designations 
would be at the end of the unique 15- 
digit identification card. 
So, for instance, there would be the 
15-digit number, and at the end of that 
would be the initials AG for agri-
culture, HP for hospitality, or CS for 
construction. 
The way this program is set up would 
allow a person to apply, prior to com-
ing into the United States, to work in 
a specific sector. For example, if the 
person applies to the agricultural sec-
tor, they don’t come into the country 
until there is a job. 
So, at the beginning of the process, 
they are what we would call an appli-
cant. When the person applies and goes 
through the process and gets accepted 
into the guest worker program for agri-
culture, that individual also agrees 
that they will work only in the agri-
culture sector. Or if they want to work 
construction, they are agreeing to 
work only in the construction sector.

Therefore, they get accepted into a 
program based on a need for that job, 
and they get issued a GWIC card, a 
guest worker identification card, that 
the individual’s personal information is 
embedded in. The GWIC card, again, 
would have a unique 15-digit number 
with the initials AG for agriculture. 
This worker has agreed only to work in 
the agriculture sector. 
So, when the agriculture producer 
enters the individual’s number into a 
GWIC reading machine, into the E- 
Verify system, it is promptly verified 
by the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity as an approved worker in the agri-
culture sector. This would also apply 
for the construction industry and also 
for the hospitality industry. The pro-
ducer and the worker have the assur-
ance that they are in compliance with 
the law. 
If a producer or worker hires or 
works outside of the permitted sector 
according to the GWIC designation, 
they are doing so fraudulently and sub-
ject to fines and being blocked from 
the E-Verify system in the future for a 
period of time. This will limit the pro-
ducer’s availability for labor and also 
prevent that worker from employment 
opportunities in the United States. 
This proposed solution has already 
been created in legislation for the agri-
culture sector. It is called the Agri-
culture Guest Worker Program. This 
legislation has been created in a bipar-
tisan fashion in the House and shared 
with both parties in the Senate. It has 
also been shared with the White House 
and with the USDA. It will solve the 
incentive that we have for the individ-
uals willing to come to the United 
States illegally to find work. 
Most of the individuals who come 
here are looking to work in the less- 
skilled fields that exist in the agri-
culture, hospitality, and construction 
fields. They will not be able to work le-
gally without the proper permit as des-
ignated by the guest worker identifica-
tion card, nor will employers be able to 
hire individuals without the proper 
guest worker identification permit. 
In my home State of Florida, Gov-
ernor DeSantis is pushing to have man-
datory E-Verify implemented soon. I 
commend him for this initiative. In 
fact, I had a phone call with him today. 
However, legislators in the State 
body are objecting to this program. 
Even members in his own party are re-
sisting this requirement. Oftentimes, 
this is what creates the inaction 
known too well in Washington, D.C., 
and also at the State level. Therefore, 
nothing gets solved. This resistance 
comes from not having a sensible work-
ing program for people to apply to the 
E-Verify system and also having the 
identification that a worker can get, 
and so what happens is a stagnation of 
ideas for things moving forward. 
What we are proposing is this pro-
gram that people can apply to work. 
Say, if they want to work in the agri-
culture sector, they can apply before 
they come into the country. It stops 
that need for people having to cross the 
desert to get into this country illegally 
because now they can do that before 
they come into the country. 
They come into the country when a 
job is available. They are already auto-
matically enrolled into the E-Verify 
system, so our producers in the agri-
culture sector have a readily predict-
able, legal workforce that is there that 
they can pull from and they can verify 
and be in compliance with the law. 
Like I said, what is needed is a work-
able guest worker program that allows 
for the worker to enter the E-Verify 
system prior to entering into the 
United States as well as allowing work-
ers into the country to enter this pro-
gram. 
Right now in this country, we have 
between 12 to 15 million people who are 
in this country illegally. Some of them 
came legally on a work visa, but then 
they just kind of drifted off and stayed 
in this country and did not leave when 
they were supposed to. 
With this program that we are pro-
posing with this legislation, workers 
could enter into this program and they 
could become legally accepted into the 
United States. It is not a pathway to 
citizenship, but it doesn’t prevent 
somebody from applying for citizen-
ship. 
This agriculture guest worker pro-
gram is incorporating the guest worker 
identification number in the E-Verify 
system as I propose. It is a workable 
solution for our producers that want to 
be compliant with a workable E-Verify 
system and have access to a reliable, 
predictable, and legal labor pool. This 
program also gives the migrant worker 
who desires the opportunity to work in 
this country a legal way to accomplish 
that. 
In the agriculture sector, which I 
know very well, as we went around the 
State of Florida and we talked to the 
migrant workers, they say they can 
come and work 5 months in this coun-
try and make the equivalent of 5 years 
of income in their country. 
And I had one of my producers say, if 
we don’t fix our labor issue in America, 
we are either going to import our labor 
or we are going to import our food. If 
we get to a situation in America where 
we are importing our food, it is a na-
tional security risk. 
This is something that Congress can 
come together and fix. It shouldn’t be a 
partisan issue. This is a solution to a 
problem that is good for America; and 
if a solution is good for America, ev-
erybody benefits from it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNIZING MARK CANTY 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Black History Month, I want to rec-
ognize Mark Canty. 
Undersheriff Mark Canty has deep 
roots in Orange County. He grew up in 
Pine Hills, and after graduating from 
Northwestern University in 1994, he 
came home to Orlando, where working 
in a residential group home for the 
Urban League made him realize that a 
career in law enforcement was his call-
ing. 
He was driven by a desire to make a 
bigger impact in the community and 
beyond, by making connections with 
young people before they were in trou-
ble. That led him to the Orlando Police 
Department, where, over his 22-year ca-
reer, he rose through the ranks and was 
appointed deputy chief in 2017. 
Throughout his career, Canty’s devo-
tion to improving community and po-
lice relations in his hometown has been 
his driving ideal. Canty’s hallmark is 
leadership by example. 
That leadership was in the spotlight 
most in June 2016 when a deranged gun-
man killed 49 people and injured scores 
more in an act of terror and hate at the 
Pulse nightclub. As commander of the 
Orlando Police Department’s SWAT 
team, Canty directed team members 
while 
they 
rescued 
survivors 
and 
helped to ensure no more innocent peo-
ple were killed. 
Over the years, Canty’s community 
involvement strides have been just as 
important as those he made in crime- 
fighting. In March 2019, Sheriff John W.

RECOGNIZING RICHARD DELOACH 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Black History Month, I want to rec-
ognize Richard DeLoach. 
Richard DeLoach is a passionate, 
dedicated, and determined leader who 
has been serving our youth football 
coach leagues for over 35 years. 
DeLoach is a pastor at a church in 
Leesburg. He is married to Diane and is 
a father of nine children. 
After playing semipro ball for a sea-
son, he decided he wanted to coach. He 
is a founding member of the Mid-Flor-
ida Youth Football Conference and an 
inaugural member of the Mid-Florida 
Youth Football and Cheerleaders Hall 
of Fame of 2018. He started the Mid- 
Florida Youth Football League in 1984 
with four teams and now has 356 play-
ers and cheerleaders involved in the 
program. 
He is a compassionate and committed 
coach, a team player who led his team 
to 14 league super bowls and won 11 of 
them. He works well with kids of all 
ages, loves sports, and has a passion for 
competition. 
DeLoach has always helped any child 
who desires to participate in youth 
sports attain that goal, regardless of 
their ability to play. He uses sports to 
teach about and instill in youth work 
ethics and integrity. 
His work ethic stems from his father 
teaching him and his three brothers 
how to mow yards and clear lakes 
every day after school. 
He has made positive impacts on so 
many young people and is credited 
with the success of several Polk Coun-
ty football players now playing in the 
NFL. 
He is the president of the Lake Wales 
Youth Football Association, a member

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1122 
February 12, 2020 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
today I would like to address one more 
time what I think is the most impor-
tant issue facing the country, because 
it deals so much with the country’s fu-
ture and who will be living in the coun-
try 10, 20, or 30 years down the road: 
And that is immigration. 
To a large extent we haven’t ad-
dressed this issue as we should have, I 
think, in part, because we are spending 
a great deal of time on impeachment, 
and that kind of sucked the air out of 
other critical issues facing the coun-
try. I think even conservative media, 
be it talk radio or other media, have 
not dealt with what is going on with 
immigration, have not pointed out the 
progress that President Trump has 
made, but also have not highlighted 
the things that have to be done if we 
are going to assure in the future the 
people living in this country are people 
who are going to make a positive con-
tribution to the Nation. 
President Trump on his own, through 
a variety of efforts, has reduced the 
number of people who are coming in 
this country from over 140,000 people 
processed last May—a time in which at 
least 90,000 people were placed in the 
United 
States 
somewhere—to 
well 
under 50,000 with under 1,000 people in 
January being placed in the United 
States. Dropping from over 90,000 to 
under 1,000 is the type of progress you 
rarely see anywhere in government. 
First of all, I thank President Trump 
for the things he has done. We now 
have the Mexican military patrolling 
the southern border, so it is not just 
our border patrol minding things. 
Even more significantly, the Mexican 
Government has agreed to hold people 
who are seeking asylum. Prior to this, 
people seeking asylum—and anybody 
can seek asylum—were placed with a 
social services agency in the United 
States, 
frequently 
Catholic 
Social 
Services, placed somewhere in the 
United States pending a hearing and 
frequently never showing up for that 
hearing. Now they are held in Mexico, 
which is a big benefit and also will dis-
courage people from coming here un-
necessarily. And I think the vast ma-
jority of people that were seeking asy-
lum in the past were not even really 
subject to any fear or any possible dan-
ger in their home country. 
Just 
as 
significantly, 
President 
Trump has reached agreements with 
Central American countries to hold 
people down there who are seeking asy-
lum from further down south. It should 
go without saying that if I leave Ven-
ezuela because I feel a threat to my-
self, I would probably stay in a country 
relatively near Venezuela. If I am 
going all the way to the United States 
and having passed through five or six 
other countries, my primary goal is 
probably to improve my economic con-
dition, not just escape danger in my 
homeland. President Trump’s efforts 
with Central American countries to 
hold more people are also bearing fruit. 
However, we also have to talk about 
what has to be done in the future and 
what should be done by Congress, com-
monsense things—now, I am one of 
those Congressmen using the phrase 
‘‘commonsense,’’ it is kind of over-
used—but commonsense things I think 
the vast majority of Americans would 
agree with. 
First of all, the Flores settlement 
right now requires having to release 
families after being held for 20 days. 
That obviously should be extended, and 
it creates a very difficult situation for 
the United States Government. 
Secondly, President Trump is trying 
to crack down on people getting wel-
fare payments if they are coming here 
as immigrants. Obviously, we have no 
problem taking care of Americans who 
are going through a tough time, but we 
take immigrants here—given that we 
have a trillion-dollar debt—who can 
take care of themselves. It would be a 
big mistake, both cost wise and as far 
as the future of people who are coming 
here, to allow people to come here if 
they will be taking advantage of our 
generous welfare system. 
In particular, we have to do some-
thing with what some people want: 
Free medical care for people coming 
here as immigrants. I have been down 
to the border several times, and it is 
something that frustrates the Border 
Patrol. 
So, many Americans right now have 
large deductibles and have to hesitate 
before they go to the doctor or hesitate 
before they have a procedure done. 
That is not true of people who come 
here illegally. And the Border Patrol 
believes that right now some people are 
coming to the country primarily for 
the free medical care that is being of-
fered. That is something we have to get 
rid of. 
President Trump continues to build 
the wall as quickly as he can, given the 
way government operates. I am glad 
that President Trump was able to find 
money in the Defense Department to 
help along the wall. 
I want to point out that every Border 
Patrol agent that I have talked to, and 
I must have talked to dozens, believe 
the wall is a good idea. I realize there 
are people who haven’t gone to the bor-
der or dealt with the experts down 
there, but unless you secure that 
southern border, you have a tremen-
dous problem. And part of that prob-
lem, by the way, is the danger people 
trying to come here face. 
Somebody is going to control that 
southern border; it is either going to be 
the United States or the Mexican drug 
cartels. If the Mexican drug cartels 
continue to control the border, it 
means that some people are going to 
wind up dehydrating in the desert, it 
means some people are going to wind 
up drowning in the Rio Grande, and it 
means the people who come here are 
frequently going to be subject to the 
whims of the Mexican cartels. Some-
times 
that 
means 
sexual 
assault. 
Sometimes it means their relatives 
back home are going to be threatened. 
But we want to be the ones controlling 
the border and who comes across. 
Again, if we don’t determine it, the 
Mexican drug cartels determine it. 
I have to point out that we believe 
that over 1,000 gang members were 
caught last year. Among certain drugs, 
over 90 percent, of course according to 
the DEA, have gotten into this country 
by going through the southern border. 
We really can’t say we are serious 
about addressing the opioid crisis until 
we do something at the southern bor-
der. 
The next thing we should be address-
ing is sanctuary cities. Sanctuary cit-
ies are an invitation for people to 
break American law. It is hard to say 
we have a serious immigration system 
when, on the other hand, we have indi-
vidual, local government people, in es-
sence, saying come here, we will not 
enforce our law. 
Another huge problem with sanc-
tuary cities is it makes it difficult to 
deport the criminals. Obviously, we 
don’t want the next generation of 
Americans to be criminal in nature, 
and the only way to deal with that, I 
believe, is to get rid of the sanctuary 
cities. Last year, 68,000 people died of 
various drug overdoses in this country. 
The next thing that should be done is 
we should be doing something about 
birthright citizenship. When I was 
down at the border, it was very appar-
ent there were women coming here, 
and not a few, who were 7 or 8 months 
pregnant. In other words, they are 
coming here, not because we handpick 
them, they are coming here because 
they realize that their children become 
citizens, and largely, if their children 
become citizens—and we are not for 
breaking up families—the parents will 
be able to stay here, too. 
The United States is only one of two 
of the 45 wealthiest countries in the 
world which allows birthright citizen-
ship. It is obviously something that we 
ought to get rid of, and this is another 
thing that Congress ought to do. 
In the upcoming budget bill, having 
talked to the Border Patrol and having 
talked to ICE, it would be a good idea 
to get more dogs on the border, not 
just to detect things coming into the 
country but to detect cash going out of 
the country. 
b 1845 
Dogs today can do something about 
that, can detect cash. It would do a lot, 
I think, to stop the drug cartels from 
using our border. 
In any event, these are some of the 
suggestions that I hope Congress takes 
up. 
I think it is such an important deci-
sion, because we know that very fre-
quently when somebody comes to this 
country, they are not leaving. 
If we are picking good people—and 
under President Trump in the last few 
years, the number of people sworn in 
legally has gone up. We are now over 
650,000. 
So 
nobody 
says

Trump is anti-immigrant. We are get-
ting more people here legally. 
But we have got to prevent people 
from coming here illegally. By con-
tinuing to do this, we will continue to 
create a situation in which the future 
of America will look more bleak be-
cause the type of people coming here 
are not the type of people who are 
handpicked.

S999 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2020 
No. 29 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, who sustains our universe by 
Your boundless power, preserve our 
Senators with Your goodness, and rule 
them with Your justice. Lord, we cast 
ourselves entirely upon Your faithful-
ness, for You are the source of every 
blessing. 
Stabilize our lawmakers in the midst 
of the contradictions of reality. Grant 
that they will be able to make sense 
out of life’s complexities. Lord, help 
our legislators know the constancy of 
Your presence and the certainty of 
Your judgment as You guide them with 
Your higher wisdom. 
We pray in Your generous Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PARKLAND SHOOTING 
ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
this Friday marks the 2-year anniver-
sary of the shooting at the school in 
Parkland, FL, where 17 innocent lives 
were lost at the hands of evil. We will 
never forget that tragic moment and 
day. 
I am dedicated to keeping weapons 
from dangerous people. That is why I 
have introduced the EAGLES Act over 
the past 2 years. This bipartisan, bi-
cameral bill reauthorizes and expands 
the leading center in threat assessment 
and prevention. This bill is a tribute to 
the victims and the families. 
Also, the Justice Department still 
hasn’t provided to Congress its report 
on the shooting. I hope the Department 
of Justice will get off the stick. It owes 
it to the families to get this report 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
FORT KNOX 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, the U.S. Army and the Com-
monwealth of Kentucky both received 
some really great news. 
Secretary of the Army Ryan McCar-
thy and Army Chief of Staff GEN 
James McConville announced that Fort 
Knox will be the headquarters for the 
new Army Corps. They stopped by my 
office last night to discuss the good 
news. 
The new Fifth Corps will support 
U.S. forces and operations in Europe, 
helping fulfill requirements of the na-
tional defense strategy. It is expected 
to bring more than 600 additional sol-
diers to Fort Knox. 
Along 
with 
Congressman 
BRETT 
GUTHRIE and Senator PAUL, I had urged 
Army leadership to select Fort Knox 
for this new corps headquarters, and, 
obviously, we think they made a great 
choice. 
Now Fifth Corps will join the eight 
commands already stationed there, in-
cluding the Army’s Human Resources, 
Recruiting, and Cadet Commands. I 
have worked for years to help ensure 
that Fort Knox receives the national 
attention that it deserves. 
It is really great to see the Army 
agrees that its high-quality facilities 
are perfect for this new headquarters. 
The extraordinary work of the Knox 
Regional Development Alliance has 
made it a wonderful place both to live 
and to work—both for servicemembers 
and for their families. 
Last year I was proud to host Defense 
Secretary Mark Esper in Kentucky to 
meet with members of the Fort Knox 
community. I am certainly grateful to 
him, Secretary McCarthy, and General 
McConville for recognizing our poten-
tial. 
f 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, today, the Senate 
will consider a War Powers Resolution 
offered by the junior Senator from Vir-
ginia. Our colleague’s resolution is 
deeply flawed on a number of levels. 
As I explained yesterday, it is too 
blunt and too broad. It is also an abuse 
of the War Powers Act, which was de-
signed to strike a balance between the 
President’s constitutional war powers 
and Congress’s own war powers and 
oversight responsibilities. 
Some of us believe the War Powers 
Act went too far in undermining the 
separation of powers and infringing 
upon the authorities of the Commander 
in Chief. But apart from that debate, 
everyone should acknowledge that it 
was designed to stop Vietnams—the de-
ployment of thousands of troops into 
sustained 
combat 
without 
congres-
sional authorization, not the one-off

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1000 
February 12, 2020 
uses of limited force that Presidents 
have carried out literally for centuries. 
Until recently, most in this body rec-
ognized the need for Presidents to have 
flexibility with respect to the threat of 
military force. They saw the deterrent 
effect and diplomatic utility of keeping 
our options open. 
During President Obama’s tenure, 
Democrats said frequently that when it 
comes to Iran, we should never take 
the military option off the table. But 
now they seek to use this privileged 
resolution to do precisely that. 
The collateral institutional damage 
of this action would fall on our mili-
tary. Its ability to operate quickly and 
adaptively to emerging threats would 
be jeopardized. 
Colleagues, if you want to take the 
truly significant step of preemptively 
taking options off the table for defend-
ing our troops, if you really want to re-
move troops from Syria or Iraq alto-
gether, why don’t you just be honest 
about it and make your case? Find 60 
votes to pass legislation. Find 67 votes 
to override a Presidential veto. Don’t 
use a blunt and imprecise War Powers 
Resolution to end-run around the con-
stitutional structures that make this a 
difficult proposition by design. 
There is no ongoing, protracted com-
bat with respect to Iran. Our troops are 
not mired in unending hostilities. The 
War Powers Act aims to impose a 60- 
day clock on combat operations. The 
strike 
that 
killed 
Soleimani 
took 
maybe 60 seconds. Let me say that 
again. The strike took about 60 sec-
onds. 
Clearly, this is the wrong tool for 
this subject. 
We have just come through an im-
peachment trial because House Demo-
crats rushed to use this serious tool as 
a political weapon of first resort rather 
than patiently conducting more nor-
mal oversight using the more normal 
tools that Congresses of both parties 
typically use. No patience for ordinary 
oversight—just 
rush 
to 
grab 
the 
bluntest tool available to make a polit-
ical statement against the President. 
Well, this war powers debate bears an 
eerie resemblance to that pattern. 
To listen to some of the advocates of 
Senator KAINE’s resolution, you would 
think that sweeping resolutions like 
this were the only means available to 
Senators to express any discomfort 
with White House foreign policy. Of 
course that isn’t so. 
If Senators’ priority is genuine over-
sight, there are countless tools in their 
toolbox. They can hold hearings. They 
can engage the administration di-
rectly. They can ask questions and 
raise issues they feel were not suffi-
ciently addressed in interagency delib-
erations. 
Instead, like impeachment, this War 
Powers Resolution cuts short that 
interplay between the branches. It 
short-circuits the thoughtful delibera-
tion and debate. It is a dangerously 
overbroad resolution that should not 
pass Congress and is certain to be ve-
toed if it does. If my colleagues want to 
make a real difference, this is not the 
way to go. 
The amendments my Republican col-
leagues and I have filed expose the 
shortcomings and unintended risks of 
this approach. 
Senator KAINE has drafted a rule of 
construction that tries to provide an 
exception allowing U.S. troops to de-
fend themselves against an attack if it 
is ‘‘imminent.’’ My amendment exposes 
the absurdity of this by simply remov-
ing the word ‘‘imminent.’’ 
How imminent, exactly, is imminent 
enough? When do our men and women 
in uniform get to defend themselves? I 
would like to know. Should our serv-
icemembers need to sit on intelligence 
until an attack is a week away? A day 
away? An hour away? Until they see 
the whites of the enemy’s eyes? 
And who makes the determination 
about imminence? Five hundred thirty- 
five Members of Congress? The Presi-
dent? A Pentagon lawyer? A battlefield 
commander? Some young private? 
This resolution imposes a new con-
straint on the military without an-
swering any of those questions. 
If we have intelligence warning that 
an enemy is planning to attack our 
forces, can we not disrupt the plot 
until the attack is almost underway? 
Senators COTTON, ROUNDS, and SUL-
LIVAN
have also filed amendments. 
They propose sensible additions to give 
our troops and their commanders more 
confidence we aren’t trying to tie their 
hands against precisely the threat they 
might face if Iran were again to be-
come emboldened enough to attack 
us—oh, and to make sure we can defend 
our diplomats and Embassies, too, if 
they were to face renewed threats. 
So clearly this resolution is not 
ready for prime time. I believe it is 
just an effort to broadcast a political 
message, but even that message can be 
harmful to our troops and to our na-
tional security. 
So what message will the Senate 
send 
to 
American 
servicemembers? 
Should they doubt whether their own 
leaders are authorized to defend them? 
What message should we send to our 
regional allies and partners? Can they 
count on continued solidarity from the 
United States? What would it say to 
real great-power competitors like Rus-
sia and China if we cannot even remain 
united in the face of a lesser challenge, 
such as Iran? 
Let’s send the right message with our 
vote. Let’s defeat this misguided reso-
lution.

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
week the Senate concluded the im-
peachment proceeding. I heard one of 
my colleagues say it is the most seri-
ous thing that the U.S. Senate has the 
constitutional authority to do. That 
argument can be made, but I would dis-
agree. 
I think the most serious thing we are 
assigned under the Constitution is the 
declaration of war because, you see, it 
isn’t just a matter of the political fate 
of any individual; it is the matter of 
the lives of many good people in Amer-
ica who serve in our Armed Forces, 
who may be in danger if we decide to 
go to war. Even under the best cir-
cumstances, a quick and effective war 
can lead to the deaths of brave and in-
nocent Americans who are simply serv-
ing their country. That is why the 
comments made by the majority leader 
this morning need to be responded to. 
His suggestion that Senator KAINE’s 
War Powers Resolution is a mistake, I 
think, really ignores the obvious. It 
has been 18 years—almost 18 years— 
since Congress and the Senate had an 
active debate about the United States 
engaging in war. I remember that de-
bate in 2002 very well because it was a 
debate that consumed the attention of 
the Senate, the House, and the Nation 
over whether we would invade Iraq and 
whether we would invade Afghanistan. 
Most of us remember the argument 
made by the Bush administration for 
the invasion of Iraq. We were told there 
were weapons of mass destruction in 
that country that could threaten the

S1001 
February 12, 2020 
neighbors of Iraq, our allies, and even 
the United States. Over and over again 
we heard that phrase, ‘‘weapons of 
mass destruction,’’ ‘‘weapons of mass 
destruction.’’ 
I was serving on the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee at that time. I re-
member the classified testimony be-
hind closed doors. I had serious doubts 
in my mind as to whether they had es-
tablished that weapons of mass de-
struction actually existed and whether 
authorizing a war meant we would just 
use that as a device to force Iraq into 
better conduct or we would actually in-
vade their country. 
As a consequence, I joined 22 other 
Senators in voting against the invasion 
of Iraq, which we voted on the floor of 
the Senate in 2002. Twenty-two Demo-
crats and one Republican all voted 
against that invasion of Iraq. Obvi-
ously, we did not prevail. A majority 
gave 
that 
authority 
to 
President 
George W. Bush, and the invasion was 
underway. I can still remember it. 
I can remember the unfolding events 
as our troops arrived, made their im-
pact on that nation, and eventually 
took control of Iraq. 
Then the search was on for the weap-
ons of mass destruction, which led to 
our invasion of Iraq. The search contin-
ued for days and weeks and months 
without any evidence of weapons of 
mass destruction. It was a farce. It was 
a fraud on the American public. Almost 
5,000 Americans lost their lives because 
of our invasion of Iraq, but the 
premise, the pretense that led to that 
invasion was misleading information 
from the administration. But at least I 
will say this: There was a debate. 
There was a vote on the floor of the 
Senate. Did anyone at that time be-
lieve, 18 years ago, that we were voting 
for a war in Iraq that would continue 
for 18 years? 
On the invasion of Afghanistan, the 
argument was made to convince me 
and virtually every Member of Con-
gress that the parties responsible for 
the tragedy and terror of 9/11 were 
somehow camped in Afghanistan, and 
we needed to go after ISIS and all 
those responsible for that 9/11 invasion 
of the United States. I voted for that, 
but I have to say as well, there wasn’t 
a single Senator or Member of the 
House who really believed that 18 years 
later, we would still be at war in Af-
ghanistan. Yet we are. 
The President is now talking about 
removing more troops from Afghani-
stan. We will see. We have heard these 
promises before, but perhaps it will 
lead to such a decision by the adminis-
tration. 
The point I am getting to is, the 
Kaine War Powers Resolution—I see 
Senator KAINE has come to the floor— 
really addresses the most fundamental 
question of our constitutional author-
ity and responsibility to declare war. 
As Senator KAINE says in this resolu-
tion, which I am happy to cosponsor, 
Congress has the sole power to declare 
war under article I, section 8, clause 11, 
of the U.S. Constitution. 
When I heard Senator MCCONNELL 
come to the floor this morning and 
argue against the Senate stepping for-
ward and asserting its constitutional 
authority, I wondered, how does he ex-
plain in the Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky that we are still engaged in a 
war 18 years after there was any vote 
for an authorization for use of military 
force in Iraq and Afghanistan? 
The larger question Senator KAINE 
and I tried to raise in this resolution 
is, What does this mean in terms of our 
future relationship with Iran and their 
neighbor, Iraq? We know we have had a 
rocky and contentious relationship 
with that country. We know they have 
engaged in acts of terrorism that cost 
American lives. There has been tension 
between our countries for decades. We 
know that full well. 
President Obama tried to at least 
bring some sanity to the relationship 
by limiting the ability of the Iranians 
to develop nuclear weapons. He felt, I 
felt, and most Americans felt that was 
a step in the right direction, to take 
the nuclear weapons out of the hands 
of Iraq so that even if they are engaged 
in conduct we find reprehensible, it 
would not reach that horrible level of a 
nuclear confrontation. 
I thought the President was right. I 
supported President Obama’s efforts to 
develop 
this 
inspection 
mechanism 
where international inspectors would 
come into Iran and see if they were de-
veloping weapons and report to the 
world. 
We engaged countries around the 
world to join us in this effort to stop 
the development of nuclear weapons in 
Iran. It was an incredible coalition 
that included Russia and China and the 
European nations that joined with us 
to impose this limitation of nuclear 
weapons in Iran. I thought it was a 
move in the right direction to have 
this kind of international support. 
Yet, when President Trump took of-
fice, sadly, he kept his promise to 
eliminate that nuclear control agree-
ment between the United States, Iran, 
and the other parties. By eliminating 
it, he basically gave permission to the 
Iranians to continue development of 
nuclear weapons. Yet he warned the 
Iranians that if they did, there would 
be a price to pay. 
This is the very reason why this reso-
lution by Senator KAINE is relevant 
and why we need to consider what the 
next step will be, because if we are 
going to stop the Iranians from devel-
oping nuclear weapons—and I pray 
they will not—how are we going to do 
it and how much force will we use in 
response? Will it be authorized by the 
Constitution and by Congress? 
I listened to Senator MCCONNELL this 
morning, and he has basically said to 
do nothing. Do nothing. Don’t assert 
the constitutional authority of the 
Congress under the Constitution when 
it comes to any declaration of war 
against Iran or any future military en-
deavors. He described this as a one-off 
situation, a one-off use of force that we 
have currently seen in the targeting of 
General Soleimani. Perhaps it was, but 
we don’t know the answer to that. 
When it happened a few weeks ago, 
there was real uncertainty about what 
would follow, and I suppose that uncer-
tainty is still here to this day. 
This morning, the majority leader 
said that he thought the impeachment 
effort that came to the Senate over the 
last week would not have occurred if 
we had been patient, and he said this is 
another example of impatience where 
we are setting up this constitutional 
responsibility of the administration. 
Well, I disagree with him on two 
counts. If Senator MCCONNELL is coun-
seling patience, patience in an im-
peachment trial would certainly have 
involved evidence, documents, and wit-
nesses. Yet he was impatient to get it 
over with without any evidence coming 
before the Senate. 
I also would say that patience is a 
good virtue when it comes to most of 
life’s experiences, and it certainly is if 
there is a prospect of war. 
What Senator KAINE is doing is as-
serting the authority of Congress to 
step up and be party to discussions 
about whether we move beyond the 
current situation to one that involves 
troops or any type of invasion of terri-
tory in Iran. 
I see Senator KAINE is on the floor, 
and I will defer to him in a moment, 
but I will tell you this before I sit 
down: As long as I have been a Member 
of the House and Senate, I have felt 
that Congress has a responsibility 
under the Constitution to declare war. 
It is a responsibility that most Mem-
bers of Congress talk about a lot but, 
frankly, don’t want to face. They don’t 
want to be on the record for or against 
war for fear they will guess wrong in 
terms of certain foreign policy deci-
sions. 
Regardless, I think the Framers of 
our Constitution understood full well 
that if we are going to ask American 
families to potentially sacrifice the 
lives of their sons and daughters in 
combat, in a war, they should have a 
voice in the decision on going to war. 
That is what this article in the Con-
stitution provides—a voice for the U.S. 
public that comes through the Con-
gress as to whether we are going to en-
gage in a war. Otherwise, we find our-
selves in a situation like today, 18 
years after an authorization of use of 
military force—and part of it under 
false pretenses—continuing a military 
effort that was never truly authorized. 
I support Senator KAINE’s effort. I am 
glad it is a bipartisan resolution. 
I yield the floor.

powerful advocate of this principle that 
we don’t stand in contradiction of this 
President or any President when we 
stand for the proposition that Congress 
should do its job under article I of the 
Constitution, and I applaud my col-
league for his strong support. 
I will take the floor later today to 
talk about the bipartisan resolution he 
has just described. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
are likely to postpone a vote this week 
that had been scheduled on a Congres-
sional Review Act resolution of dis-
approval relative to Education Sec-
retary Betsy DeVos’s new borrower de-
fense rule. I would like to explain the 
background behind this procedure. Al-
though it is likely it will be postponed 
until after our 1-week President’s Day 
recess, I still think Members should re-
flect on the importance of this meas-
ure. 
In 1992 Congress added a provision to 
the Higher Education Act that allowed 
student borrowers who were defrauded 
by their schools to have their Federal 
student loans discharged. Here is what 
it boiled down to: The Federal Govern-
ment recognizes the accreditation of 
colleges and universities. With that 
recognition, those colleges and univer-
sities can offer Federal loans to the 
students who attend. So there is a part-
nership that begins this process and 
this relationship, and the partnership 
is a seal of approval by the Federal 
Government in the authorization of 
Federal loans. 
What we found was that some of the 
institutions that were given permission 
to authorize Federal student loans for 
those attending their institutions, in 
fact, were lying to their students. So 
the students were in a situation where 
they incurred a debt in student loans 
for promises made by a college or uni-
versity that turned out to be false. 
We said that under the law, that is 
not fair to the student and the stu-
dent’s family. Those students can be 
discharged from federal student debt if, 
in fact, that college or university de-
frauded them. 
What would be a typical fraud? To in-
vite students to enroll in your college 
with the promise that the courses they 
take 
in 
that 
college 
would 
be 
transferrable, that the credits are 
transferrable to another school, and 
then it turns out to be a lie; the prom-
ise that if you complete a certain num-
ber of courses in the school, you will 
have satisfied the requirements for li-
censure for nursing, for example, and 
that turns out to be a lie; or the possi-
bility that you would finish the courses 
of this school and get a job in a certain 
field. 
Great promises were made to the stu-
dents, and it turns out they were lies. 
In 
those 
circumstances, 
students— 
many of whom are young and facing 
the first serious financial decision of 
their lives—were misled and defrauded. 
We said that under the law, those stu-
dents should have an opportunity to 
discharge their student loan. 
It is bad enough they were lied to, 
bad enough they wasted their time, and 
bad enough they had a college experi-
ence that didn’t make life better for 
them, but to be saddled with debt be-
cause that school lied to them and de-
frauded them is unacceptable. The 
process for having their loans dis-
charged is called borrower defense. 
Under President Obama, we found 
that many schools—almost exclusively 
for-profit universities such as Corin-
thian, ITT, and others—lied to stu-
dents about what their experience 
would be if they went there. So the stu-
dents, saddled with debt, having been 
lied to, went to the Department of Edu-
cation to have that debt discharged. 
There was some success in that, but 
then came the new President. 
President Trump, with his Secretary 
of Education, Betsy DeVos, took a 
much different view and has ignored 
the claims of these students for dis-
charge of their student loans. They 
started stacking up, and nearly 230,000 
students from across the United States 
who were looking for this borrower de-
fense relief from their student loans, 
after having been lied to and defrauded 
by these colleges and universities, just 
found no response whatsoever from the 
Trump administration and from Edu-
cation Secretary DeVos. As a con-
sequence, they asked Members of Con-
gress to intervene, and we tried but 
with no success. 
Then Secretary DeVos took this deci-
sive step in changing the rules for fu-
ture students. Do you know what she 
said? She said to these students: In the 
future, if you want relief from student 
debt from being defrauded, prove your 
case. Lawyer-up. Get your lawyer, and 
let’s have a hearing. 
Well, understand that these stu-
dents—young and in debt to start 
with—are not likely to turn around and 
hire a lawyer to prove Corinthian, in 
its catalogues and representations to 
students, for example, misrepresented 
the education they were offering. 
Under the previous administration, 
that could be established in evidence, 
and all the students affected by it 
could use that evidence. Under the 
DeVos administration, it is an indi-
vidual burden of proof to qualify for 
borrower defense. So that will leave 
many students with no recourse. As a 
consequence, they will be stuck with 
the debt for a worthless education or 
one that didn’t meet as promised. 
More than 223,000 claims are pending 
before the Department. Many of them 
have been waiting for years. The 
claims come from every State in the 
Union—large, small, red, blue and pur-
ple—and they are not going to stop. 
These claims have led to this CRA, this 
Congressional Review Act resolution of 
disapproval. 
I doubt that we are going to be tak-
ing it up this week, so I am going to 
withhold making a presentation on 
this until we return after the Presi-
dent’s Day recess. But I want to make 
one last point. We are not just bringing 
this up on behalf of students; we are 
bringing this matter before the Senate 
on behalf of veterans. Student vet-
erans. 
The American Legion of the United 
States has stepped up and said to us 
that veterans have been defrauded just 
like the students we are talking about 
on the floor of the Senate. 
If you believe in these veterans and 
these military families who are stuck 
with student loan debt because of lies 
from colleges and universities, I urge 
my colleagues to think twice and join 
us in this effort to stop the DeVos rules 
and give our veterans a fighting chance 
not to be burdened with this unfair 
debt. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
voting to acquit President Trump of an 
abuse of power and obstruction of Con-
gress, Senate Republicans sought to 
justify their vote by claiming that the 
President had ‘‘learned his lesson.’’ 
The implication was that the ordeal of 
impeachment and its permanent stain 
on his reputation that can never be 
erased 
would 
chasten 
President 
Trump’s future behavior—a toddler 
scolded into compliance. 
The explanation, frankly, looked like 
an excuse. It was unconvincing the mo-
ment it was uttered. No serious person 
believes President Trump has learned 
any lesson. He doesn’t learn any les-
sons. He does just what he wants and 
what suits his ego at the moment. Ob-
servers of the President would question 
whether he is even capable of learning 
a lesson, and, unsurprisingly, the flim-
sy rationalization by some Senate Re-
publicans, desperate to have an excuse 
because they were so afraid of doing 
the right thing, was disproven within a 
matter of days. 
President Trump was acquitted by 
Senate Republicans last Wednesday. On 
Friday, he began dismissing members 
of his administration who testified in 
the impeachment inquiry, including 
the patriot, LTC Alexander Vindman 
and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a 
clear and obvious act of retaliation— 
very simply, that is all it was—against 
witnesses who told the truth under 
oath. 
President Trump hates the truth, 
time and time again, because he knows 
he lies, and when other people tell the 
truth, he hates it, so he fired them. 
The President even fired the brother of 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman for the 
crime of being related to someone the 
President wanted out. How vindictive,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1003 
February 12, 2020 
how petty, how nasty, and yet there 
are rumors now that the President 
might dismiss the inspector general of 
the intelligence community, the offi-
cial who received the whistleblower re-
port. These are patriots all. President 
Trump can’t stand patriots because 
they stand for country, not for what he 
wants. 
Yesterday, once again and typically, 
the White House reportedly decided to 
withdraw the nomination of Elaine 
McCusker, who was in line to serve as 
the Pentagon Comptroller and Chief 
Financial Officer. Why did he dismiss 
her—a longtime serving, very capable 
woman? Because over the summer, Ms. 
McCusker advised—merely advised— 
members of the administration about 
the legal ramifications of denying as-
sistance to Ukraine. Her crime, in the 
eyes of President Trump and his so 
many acolytes—henchmen—in the ad-
ministration, was attempting to follow 
the law. How dare she try to follow the 
law. How dare she even voice this is 
what the law is in this kind of adminis-
tration. 
Of course, yesterday, after career 
prosecutors recommended that Roger 
Stone be sentenced to 7 to 9 years in 
Federal prison for witness tampering 
and lying abjectly to Congress, the 
President tweeted that his former con-
fidant was being treated extremely un-
fair. It appears the Attorney General of 
the United States and other political 
appointees of the Justice Department 
intervened to countermand the sen-
tencing recommendation. As a result, 
in an unprecedented but brave, coura-
geous, and patriotic move, four career 
prosecutors working on the Roger 
Stone case—all four of them—withdrew 
from the case or resigned from the Jus-
tice Department. 
When asked about the clear impro-
priety of intervening in a Federal case, 
the President said he has an ‘‘absolute 
right’’ to order the Justice Department 
to do whatever he wants. This morn-
ing, the President congratulated the 
Attorney General, amazingly enough, 
for taking charge of the case. 
The President ran against the swamp 
in Washington, a place where the game 
is rigged by the powerful to benefit 
them personally. I ask my fellow 
Americans: What is more swampy, 
what is more fetid, and what is more 
stinking than the most powerful person 
in the country literally changing the 
rules to benefit a crony guilty of 
breaking the law? 
As a result, I have formally requested 
that the inspector general of the Jus-
tice Department investigate this mat-
ter immediately. This morning, I call 
on 
Judiciary 
Committee 
Chairman 
GRAHAM
to convene an emergency 
hearing of the Judiciary Committee to 
do the same—to conduct oversight and 
hold hearings. That is the job of the 
Judiciary Committee, no matter who is 
President and whether the President is 
from your party or not. Something 
egregious like this demands that the 
inspector general investigate and de-
mands that the chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee hold a hearing now. 
The President is claiming that rig-
ging the rules is perfectly legitimate. 
He claims an absolute right to order 
the Justice Department to do anything 
he wants. The President has, as his At-
torney General, an enabler—and that is 
a kind word—who actually supports 
this view. Does anyone think it is out 
of the question that President Trump 
might order the FBI to investigate Hil-
lary Clinton, Joe Biden, or anyone else 
without any evidence to support such 
an arbitrary violation of individual 
rights? Oh, I know, some far-right con-
spiratorial writer, who has no credi-
bility, who just makes things up, 
writes it, FOX News puts it on, Sean 
Hannity or someone talks about it, and 
then the President says ‘‘investigate.’’ 
That 
is 
third-world 
behavior, 
not 
American behavior. That kind of be-
havior defiles that great flag that is 
standing above us. This is not ordinary 
stuff. I have never seen it before with 
any 
President—Democratic, 
Repub-
lican, liberal or conservative. 
Does any serious person believe the 
President’s abuse would be limited to 
the Justice Department? Does any seri-
ous person think that Trump might not 
order the Justice Department to treat 
his friends, associates, and family 
members differently than it treats or-
dinary citizens and that Attorney Gen-
eral Barr would just carry out these or-
ders? 
Of course, none of this is out of the 
question. The President asserted his 
absolute right to do whatever he wants 
yesterday. We are witnessing a crisis in 
the rule of law in America, unlike one 
we have ever seen before. It is a crisis 
of President Trump’s making, but it 
was enabled and emboldened by every 
Senate Republican who was too afraid 
to stand up to him and say the simple 
word ‘‘no’’ when the vast majority of 
them knew that was the right thing to 
do. 
Republicans thought the President 
would learn his lesson. It turned out 
that the lesson he learned was not that 
he went too far and not that he needed 
to rein it in. The lesson the President 
learned was that the Republican Party 
will not hold him accountable, no mat-
ter how egregious his behavior—not 
now, not ever. 
Senate Republicans voted to excuse 
President Trump’s abuses of power. 
They voted to abdicate the constitu-
tional authority of Congress to check 
on an overreaching Executive. Senate 
Republicans now own this crisis, and 
they are responsible for every new 
abuse of power President Trump com-
mits. John Adams famously described 
our grand Republic that he helped cre-
ate as a government of laws, not of 
men. Our Founding Fathers’ foremost 
concern, of course, was to escape the 
tyranny of a government of men—more 
specifically, a King. That is why the 
Founders created a republic in Amer-
ica. That is why the patriots died for 
the freedom we are now blessed with. 
Yet, after almost 21⁄2 centuries of ex-
perience in self-government as a repub-
lic, we are, once again, faced with a 
very serious and looming question: Do 
we want a government of laws or of 
men? Do we want to be governed by the 
laws of the United States or by the 
whims of one man? 
I don’t think my Republican col-
leagues fully appreciated what they 
were unleashing when they voted in 
the impeachment trial to excuse the 
President’s conduct—although, maybe 
they did. They were just afraid, fearful, 
shaking in their boots because Trump 
might take vengeance out on them as 
he did on Senators Flake and Corker. 
They voted to acquit the President 
after he used his immense power to 
pressure a foreign leader to announce 
an investigation to smear a rival. 
What we have seen in the hours and 
days since that fateful acquittal vote 
last Wednesday is so disturbing. In a 
parade of horribles, this is one of the 
most horrible things President Trump 
has done. In a parade of horribles, this 
is one of the most feeble and servile ac-
tions of Republicans, just no one say-
ing a peep about it. We are seeing the 
behavior of a man who has contempt 
for the rule of law beginning to try out 
the new unrestrained power conferred 
on him by 52, 53—well, 52 Republican 
Senators, 1 brave one. 
Left to his own devices, President 
Trump would turn America into a ba-
nana republic with a dictator who can 
do whatever he wants, and the Justice 
Department is the President’s personal 
law firm, not a defender of the rule of 
law. It is a sad day in America—a sad 
day. 
The Founding Fathers created some-
thing brand new, a republic, because 
they were afraid of monarchy. The Sen-
ate Republicans aided and abetted 
President Trump to get much closer to 
that monarchy than we have been in a 
long time. Senate Republicans have 
created something very close to a mon-
archy, if they can keep it. 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Madam President, now, on war pow-
ers, later today, the Senate will begin 
debate on Senator KAINE’s War Powers 
Resolution, 
preventing 
President 
Trump from unilaterally escalating 
military action against Iran. 
The Constitution is clear, Congress 
alone has the power to declare wars. 
The President has no authority to 
enter the United States into another 
endless conflict in the Middle East, but 
I fear that the strike against Iranian 
Major General Soleimani last month 
may bumble us into one. 
With this bipartisan resolution, the 
Senate can assert its constitutional au-
thority and send a clear bipartisan 
message to the President that he can-
not sidestep Congress when it comes to 
matters of war and peace. It was imme-
diately clear that the strike against 
General Soleimani was carried out 
with insufficient transparency, without 
proper notification of Congress, and 
without a clear plan for what comes 
next.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1004 
February 12, 2020 
Last month has only magnified these 
problems. President Trump initially 
claimed that no one was hurt after Iran 
retaliated against forces on January 8. 
Now the Pentagon says over 100 mili-
tary personnel suffered a traumatic 
brain injury. Why has it taken so long 
for us to learn that American troops 
were hurt in the attack? Who ordered 
the withholding of that information? 
Was it President Trump? It sure 
wouldn’t be surprising. And who in the 
military—the military, which is a bul-
wark, one of the few, particularly when 
General Mattis was the Secretary—who 
in the military let that happen? Just 
as importantly, what is the President’s 
strategy for keeping our troops safe in 
the coming weeks? 
The administration has deliberately 
refused to be transparent with Con-
gress about the aftermath of the Ira-
nian strike. I fear that by keeping Con-
gress in the dark, President Trump is, 
once again, hoping to short-circuit our 
checks and balances and escape scru-
tiny. That is why Senator KAINE’s War 
Powers Resolution is a matter of ur-
gent necessity. I commend Senator 
KAINE on the job he has done and urge 
my colleagues of both parties to vote 
in favor of this resolution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska is recognized. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the con-
firmation vote on the Kindred nomina-
tion begin following my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JOSHUA M. KINDRED 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the vote that 
the Senate is going to take on here in 
a few minutes on Joshua Kindred to be 
Alaska’s next Federal district court 
judge, and I commend this body, par-
ticularly 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, 
for 
prioritizing putting good, solid, young 
Federal judges in seats in districts and 
circuit courts all across the country— 
188 so far since the Trump administra-
tion took office, and now it is Alaska’s 
turn. 
That Federal judge seat that we are 
looking at filling here in a couple of 
minutes has been empty for almost 4 
years, and in our State, in the great 
State of Alaska, we don’t have too 
many opportunities for Federal judges. 
For example, Alaska only has 1 active 
judge on the entire Ninth Circuit Court 
of Appeals out of 29 active judges. So 
this is an important vote, certainly, for 
my State. 
I want to talk a little bit about Josh 
Kindred. I have known Josh since he 
was a young assistant district attorney 
for the State of Alaska when I was at-
torney general. We talked about how 
we were going to work together to 
make Alaska’s judicial process more 
efficient and more effective for Alas-
kans during his confirmation process. I 
certainly was impressed then, but I was 
impressed when I first met Josh many 
years ago and continue to be impressed 
with his fierce commitment to uphold-
ing the law, the concept of equal access 
to justice for all, and his keen aware-
ness of Alaska’s unique legal land-
scape. 
Josh 
was 
unanimously 
rated 
as 
‘‘qualified’’ by the ABA and is a life-
long Alaskan with a broad and impres-
sive legal background. 
As I mentioned, after clerking on the 
Oregon Supreme Court, he came back 
home to Alaska and was promoted to 
violent crimes supervisor after a num-
ber of years working in the Anchorage 
District Attorney’s Office, where he 
worked 
to 
punish 
perpetrators 
of 
crimes and with victims of some of the 
heinous crimes, unfortunately, that we 
have in too high numbers in Alaska, 
particularly as it relates to sexual as-
sault and domestic violence. In his ca-
reer, he has been committed not only 
to prosecuting those kinds of crimes 
but to doing pro bono work to stem 
this very significant crisis that my 
State has with these heinous crimes of 
sexual abuse. 
Rounding out his legal experience, 
Josh served as the environmental coun-
sel for the Alaska Oil and Gas Associa-
tion and, most recently, as the regional 
solicitor for Alaska for the U.S. De-
partment of the Interior. Now, when 
the Federal Government controls over 
60 percent of the lands in Alaska, the 
solicitor for the U.S. Department of 
the Interior position in Alaska is actu-
ally a really important one and is in-
credibly important in terms of quali-
fications for a Federal judge. 
This wide-ranging experience will be 
incredibly valuable as a district court 
judge in Alaska because he is famil-
iar—very familiar—with the numerous 
Alaska-specific laws that this body 
passes year after year, decade after 
decade: the Alaska Native Claims Set-
tlement Act, the Alaska National In-
terest Lands Conservation Act, and the 
Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act. This is an 
important 
point 
because 
very 
few 
States have such large, complex Fed-
eral laws that are focused solely on 
their State, and Federal courts often 
misinterpret these laws and don’t un-
derstand these laws, to the detriment 
of the people I represent. 
Let me just give you a recent exam-
ple. There was a Federal case under the 
law I mentioned recently, ANILCA, as 
we call it in Alaska. It involved a 
moose hunter named John Sturgeon 
who had a hovercraft and wanted to go 
moose hunting, and overbearing Fed-
eral Government agents told him he 
couldn’t use his hovercraft in certain 
areas considered Federal waters. John 
Sturgeon knew better. He challenged 
the Federal Government. There were 12 
years of litigation, twice up to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, and Federal judges at 
the district and certainly the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals level getting 
this case wrong every single time. Fi-
nally, last year, in a unanimous 9-to-0 
opinion, Justice Elena Kagan summed 
it up very succinctly when she ruled 
against all of these Federal judges in 
the Ninth Circuit and for Mr. Sturgeon. 
She said: ‘‘If Sturgeon lived in any 
other State, his suit would not have a 
prayer of success.’’ 
She went on: ‘‘Except that Sturgeon 
lives in Alaska. And as we have said be-
fore, ‘Alaska is often the exception, not 
the rule,’ ’’ under Federal law. 
So the Supreme Court gets it, and 
Josh Kindred will get it. He under-
stands Alaska’s unique legal jurispru-
dence. He is committed to honoring the 
commitments this body has made to 
Alaska’s first peoples and others in my 
great State, and he is committed to 
justice. 
I believe he will serve with honor and 
integrity on the Federal court, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote for his con-
firmation. 
I yield the floor.

REMOVAL 
OF

PROCEED 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I 
move to proceed to S.J. Res. 68. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 68, a joint 
resolution to direct the removal of United 
States Armed Forces from hostilities against 
the Islamic Republic of Iran that have not 
been authorized by Congress. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, fi-
nally, I ask unanimous consent that 
the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided 
between the two leaders or their des-
ignees. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I now 
rise to speak to the body in favor of the 
bipartisan War Powers Resolution, S.J. 
Res. 68, which is now pending before 
the Senate. 
Before I address the resolution, I 
want 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
combat 
deaths of SFC Javier Gutierrez and 
SFC Antonio Rodriguez. Both of these 
Army sergeants, sergeants first class, 
were 28-year-olds who were killed last 
week in Afghanistan. While the inci-
dent is still under investigation, it ap-
pears that they were killed by a mem-
ber of the Afghan security forces or 
somebody posing as a member of the 
Afghan security forces. As we know 
well, this is a security force that the 
United States has armed, equipped, and 
trained for 19 years. 
Sergeant Gutierrez leaves behind a 
wife, Gabby, and four children, ages 2 
through 7. His grandfather was a POW 
during World War II, and his father was 
a marine. He had previously deployed 
both to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Sergeant Rodriguez leaves behind a 
wife, Ronaleen. He had previously de-
ployed to Afghanistan 10 times. I 
thought that was a misprint when I 
read it—a 28-year-old who had pre-
viously deployed to Afghanistan 10 
times before he was killed. 
We honor their memories and send 
our condolences to their families as 
well. 
The resolution before the body today 
is about Congress reclaiming its right-
ful role in decisions about war. The res-
olution is pretty simple: We should not 
be at war with Iran unless Congress 
votes to authorize such a war. 
While the President does and must 
always have the ability to defend the 
United States from imminent attack, 
the Executive power to initiate war 
stops there. An offensive war requires a 
congressional debate and vote. 
This should not be a controversial 
proposition. It is clearly stated in the 
Constitution we pledge to support and 
defend. The principle is established 
there for a most important reason. If 
we are to order our men and women, 
like Sergeants Rodriguez and Gutier-
rez, to risk their lives and health in 
war, it should be on the basis of careful 
deliberation by the people’s elected 
legislature and not on the say-so of any 
one person. 
Congressional deliberation educates 
the American public about what are 
the stakes, what are the stakes in-
volved in any proposed war. 
Congressional 
deliberation 
allows 
Members of Congress to ask tough 
questions about the need for war, about 
the path to victory, and about how a 
victory can be sustained. And if fol-
lowing that public deliberation, there 
is a vote of Congress for war, it rep-
resents a clear statement that a war is 
in the national interest and that the 
efforts of our troops are supported by a 
clear political consensus. We should 
not allow this important process to be 
short-circuited. 
Our Framers believed that the con-
gressional deliberation would be the 
best antidote to unnecessary esca-
lation. 
I have spoken often about this topic 
on the floor during the 7 years I have 
been in the Senate, and I don’t want to 
repeat arguments that I have made 
dozens and dozens of times here, but I 
do want to address at least three objec-
tions that I have made to this resolu-
tion. 
First, there is an objection that says 
the bipartisan resolution is ‘‘an effort 
to restrain President Trump’s powers.’’ 
This is not a resolution about the 
President. The resolution does not say 
anything about President Trump or 
any President. It is a resolution about 
Congress. 
I want a President that will fully in-
habit the article II powers of Com-
mander in Chief, but as a Member of 
the Article I branch, I want an article 
I branch that would fully inhabit the 
article I powers, including the sole 
power to declare war. This is not an ef-
fort to restrain President Trump or 
some other President. This is not an ef-
fort by a Democrat to point a finger or 
to restrain Republicans. No. In the his-
tory of this country, even in recent his-
tory, I believe we have often gotten it 
wrong with respect to the initiation of 
war, whether the President was a Dem-
ocrat or Republican or whether the ma-
jority in Congress was Democratic or 
Republican. 
The legislative branch, article I, has 
allowed too much power to devolve to 
the Executive in this fundamental 
question of whether the Nation should 
be at war. This is not directed toward 
President Trump. It would apply equal-
ly to any President. It is fundamen-
tally about Congress owning up to and 
taking responsibility for the most sig-
nificant decisions that we should ever 
have to make. 
A second argument against the bill 
that I have heard made on the floor in 
recent days is that it would send a 
message of weakness to Iran or to 
other adversaries. I have to admit, I 
am more interested in the message 
that we send to the American public 
and to our troops and to our families. 
That is the message I am most inter-
ested in. 
As a father of a marine and as a Sen-
ator from a State that is just chock- 
full of Active-Duty Guard and Reserve 
veterans, DOD civilian and DOD con-
tractor military families, this bill 
sends a very strong and powerful mes-
sage to our public and to our troops 
and their families that before we get 
into a war, there will be a careful delib-
eration about whether it is necessary. 
That is a message of comfort. That is 
a message that can give our own public

February 12, 2020 
and our troops confidence, but to the 
extent that we want to consider the 
message this might send to Iran and 
adversaries, I do not think that Amer-
ica sends a message of weakness when 
we proudly hold ourselves up as a na-
tion of laws, and we pledge to follow 
the law when it comes to the monu-
mental question about whether or not 
we should be at war. 
In fact, I believe we are most effec-
tive in countering our adversaries— 
and, face it, most of our adversaries are 
authoritarian states which do not 
honor the rule of war—when we send a 
clear message that, in this country, we 
will stand for democratic principles, 
such as the rule of law, and we will fol-
low those principles when we are mak-
ing momentous decisions, such as 
whether or not we should be at war. 
A third objection I have heard is this: 
It sends a message that America is not 
likely to use military force, a message 
that, thereby, might embolden bad ac-
tors. I find this argument bewildering. 
I don’t think anyone in the world 
questions whether America will use 
military force. We have been engaged 
in a war against nonstate terrorism 
now for 19 years. The pages in this body 
have known nothing but war. These 
two 28-year-olds who were just killed 
last year, they virtually knew nothing 
other than war during their whole 
lives. 
Is America willing to use military 
action? We have been in a war for 19 
years. We are losing troops on the bat-
tlefield—like Sergeants Rodriguez and 
Gutierrez—to this very day. We have 
tens and thousands of troops deployed 
around the world to fight a war against 
terrorism, and the current President is 
increasing the total footprint of those 
troops in the Middle East to prosecute 
this fight. 
In Afghanistan alone, where these 
two sergeants were killed, we are 
spending $45 billion a year. It is 19 
years later, and we are still spending 
$45 billion a year to prosecute this 
fight. No one can question whether the 
United States will protect itself or our 
allies, but the choice of when to fight 
wars and when to use other available 
tools is always a question of such im-
portance that the most careful delib-
eration is warranted. 
As I conclude, I just want to say this. 
I went and visited the Hampton vet-
erans hospital last Friday as part of 
just, sort of, a regular visit maybe once 
a year just to check in with the Hamp-
ton VA, which is one of three VAs in 
Virginia, to see what they are doing. I 
know every Member of the Senate does 
the same thing, visiting VA hospitals 
in their States and elsewhere—going to 
see our veterans at Walter Reed, for ex-
ample, or going to see wounded war-
riors who are at the hospital at Fort 
Belvoir in Virginia. Any visit of that 
kind produces a million emotions: 
pride in service providers, pride in re-
silience of our veterans as they are 
grappling with challenging illnesses 
and disabilities in their lives, often 
long after they have served. The one 
impression that is always vivid when 
you visit a veterans hospital is this: 
the enduring consequences of war. 
As I visited the Hampton VA, I spent 
time in, sort of, two particular units. 
One is a women’s clinic. We have so 
many more women veterans, and a 
number of VAs that were not set up 
very well to deal with women are now 
having to really build out the capacity 
to deal with the growing number of 
women veterans and the issues that 
they are bringing to the table. I ap-
plaud what I saw in Hampton at the 
women’s clinic. 
I also spent time in the mental 
health unit that is trying to pioneer 
new technologies, magnetic imaging, 
to help people deal with some of the 
signature wounds of the Iraq and Af-
ghanistan war: traumatic brain injury 
and PTSD. 
We make a promise to these veterans 
that we will be there for them, even 
when we don’t fully know the con-
sequences of the promise we make be-
cause 
they 
don’t 
know 
the 
con-
sequences of what they will experience 
and suffer. 
A signature aspect of the Iraq and Af-
ghan wars that really doesn’t have an 
earlier precedent is the 10-deployments 
phenomena. In what earlier war that 
this country fought do we have 28-year- 
old sergeants who are serving their 
11th deployment in a theater of war? 
Those repeated deployments have a 
long consequence in the life of a person 
and in the life of those close to that 
person. 
Madam President knows this from 
her own service: When you go to the 
VA and you grapple with the long con-
sequences of war, it has to make an im-
pression upon those of us in this body 
charged with the sole responsibility for 
declaring war that, if and when we do 
so, we owe it the most careful delibera-
tion that we bring to any question that 
would ever result in the loss of lives. 
That is not too much to ask for us to 
deliberate carefully when what is at 
risk for those who serve, who depend 
upon us to make the best possible deci-
sion, are consequences that will last 
their own lifetimes and affect the lives 
of so many others. 
That is what this resolution is about. 
I don’t believe it should be controver-
sial. It is certainly bipartisan, and I 
hope we will stand up for this impor-
tant proposition that the careful delib-
eration of the Senate is the most nec-
essary thing we can do and what we 
owe to our troops and their families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to strongly 
urge all of my colleagues to join Sen-
ator KAINE, and I want to thank him 
for his extremely thoughtful and amaz-
ing approach to this. 
I think it is so important that we re-
assert Congress’s authority in deci-
sions concerning our Nation’s security 
and curbing this administration’s abil-
ity to put our troops in harm’s way 
without consulting the American peo-
ple. 
Following the early January attack 
on U.S. troops deployed in Iraq trig-
gered by President Trump’s decision to 
launch a drone strike that killed Iran’s 
Qasem Soleimani, I know that many 
Americans were frightened, as I was, to 
then watch tensions with Iran escalate 
so rapidly in realtime. I am glad the 
President has backed down and decided 
not to further escalate those tensions 
in recent weeks—as a voice for my 
home State of Washington, including 
all of our servicemembers and military 
families and communities. But we are 
not off the hook, and we have every 
reason to believe that Iran may retali-
ate again, which is why I remain deep-
ly disturbed by President Trump’s rush 
to incite conflict in ways that could 
have significant negative impacts on 
our strategic goals in the region and, 
more importantly, the long-term safe-
ty and security of Americans at home 
and abroad. 
To date, neither President Trump nor 
his administration has provided any 
evidence to us here in Congress to jus-
tify his actions, and despite reports 
from the administration shortly after 
the attack that there were no U.S. cas-
ualties, we are now learning more than 
100 servicemembers—100—have been di-
agnosed with traumatic brain injury 
following that attack—serious injuries 
that President Trump dismissed as 
simply ‘‘headaches.’’ 
The American people expect their 
representatives—us—to have a say in 
decisions that may put their lives or 
the lives of a loved one at risk. As the 
daughter of a World War II veteran and 
Purple Heart recipient, here in the 
Senate I make decisions about our na-
tional security with deep concern for 
our brave servicemembers and their 
families, with a personal understanding 
of the sacrifices they make for all of us 
and our Nation and an unwavering 
commitment to ensuring that they 
have the support they need while they 
serve and when they come home. 
That is exactly why our Constitution 
mandates that the power to declare 
war rests with Congress—not the Com-
mander in Chief—because those deci-
sions weren’t meant to be made by one 
person alone. That is why I am glad 
that my friend from Virginia, Senator 
KAINE, is offering this War Powers Res-
olution, of which I am very proud to be 
a cosponsor. 
Passing this resolution is a first step 
toward protecting our servicemembers 
and our interests in the region by re-
moving our troops from hostilities in 
or against Iran unless there is a dec-
laration of war or a congressional au-
thorization for the use of force. 
This isn’t just an issue for Demo-
crats. I am very proud that this resolu-
tion has bipartisan support because, no 
matter what side of the aisle you are 
on, we should all agree that Congress 
must play a role in our Nation’s for-
eign policy, as well as matters related

to the health and safety of our service-
members. 
I am grateful for all of those who are 
serving in the Middle East and around 
the world, and that is why I refuse to 
stand by and accept that they could be 
put in jeopardy or that our Nation’s 
foreign policy and safety could be up-
ended 
by 
an 
impulsive, 
late-night 
tweet. 
So I will continue to demand that the 
President provide his legal justifica-
tion for the drone strike in Iraq, com-
mit to coming before Congress in ad-
vance of any further escalating steps, 
and explain to us how he will move for-
ward in the region with the goal of pro-
tecting Americans, our allies, and our 
interests. 
In the meantime, considering the 
unique recklessness of this administra-
tion, it is urgently important for Con-
gress to pass this resolution to block 
President Trump’s ability to start a 
war with Iran and ensure that Congress 
is guaranteed the opportunity to hear 
whatever case the President may have 
before taking a vote to determine the 
path that we want our Nation to go 
down. 
In 2002 I voted against the war in Iraq 
because I felt the administration was 
asking us to send our men and women 
into harm’s way without a clear plan 
or a goal. Last week the House passed 
legislation to repeal that 2002 AUMF, 
which is a step in the right direction 
toward 
bringing 
our 
brave 
troops 
home. 
The Senate should stand up and as-
sert our authority to represent our 
constituents on this critical issue, too, 
because, as Senators, they are the peo-
ple to whom we are all accountable. We 
have to be able to go home and look 
them in the eye and say that we gave 
questions as grave as decisions con-
cerning war and peace the deliberation 
that they warrant and that we have 
done everything we can to protect our 
Nation and our servicemembers. You 
simply can’t do that if you allow this 
President—or any President—to con-
tinue conducting foreign policy—espe-
cially by tweet—unchecked. 
So Congress has an obligation to en-
sure a debate. We have an obligation to 
press this administration for a strategy 
and check its power if it doesn’t 
present a compelling one, which so far 
it hasn’t. 
Passing this War Powers Resolution 
will help us—us—do exactly that, so I 
strongly urge our colleagues to support 
this resolution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today 
we are taking up a War Powers Resolu-
tion ostensibly aimed at hostilities 
with Iran. The impetus for this resolu-
tion was the strike the President au-
thorized to take out Iranian General 
Qasem Soleimani. 
Iran has a long history of fomenting 
violence and conflict in the Middle 
East, and General Soleimani was al-
ways right in the center of that. As 
head of the Quds Force of Iran’s Revo-
lutionary Guard Corps, Soleimani mas-
terminded Iran’s terrorist activities for 
two decades. Iran has been linked to 
one in six U.S. military deaths in Iraq, 
notably through the IEDs that have be-
come so emblematic of the War on Ter-
ror. 
This was Soleimani’s work. He is re-
sponsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
American soldiers and countless inno-
cent civilians, and the threat Iran 
poses to U.S. personnel is an ongoing 
threat. At the end of December, an 
Iran-backed militia fired more than 30 
rockets at an Iraqi military base, kill-
ing 
an 
American 
contractor 
and 
wounding four U.S. troops. Days later, 
Iran-backed protesters stormed the 
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, conducting a 
2-day siege of the Embassy before with-
drawing. 
The strike on General Soleimani 
wasn’t just based on these recent at-
tacks or on Soleimani’s long reign of 
terror in the Middle East. The Presi-
dent 
authorized 
the 
strike 
on 
Soleimani because there was credible 
intelligence that Soleimani was plan-
ning imminent attacks against U.S. in-
terests. That was the conclusion not of 
the President but of the U.S. intel-
ligence community and nonpartisan ex-
perts like the CIA Director and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. It was in 
response to this conclusion from the 
intelligence community that the Presi-
dent ordered the strike. 
The War Powers Resolution coming 
before the Senate was introduced out 
of concern that taking out Iran’s top 
terrorist leader would lead to esca-
lation, but that has not happened. The 
perspective provided by the nearly 6 
weeks 
that 
have 
passed 
since 
Soleimani’s killing underscores the 
one-off nature of the strike. The Presi-
dent has not escalated this conflict or 
used Soleimani’s death as an excuse to 
send troops into action against Iran. In 
fact, this strike was designed to check 
escalation in the region—specifically, 
increasing aggression and imminent at-
tacks by Iran. 
We live in a dangerous world. The 
United States must be able to respond 
to imminent threats to our security. I 
support the robust interpretation of 
Congress’s constitutional prerogatives 
when it comes to the declaration of 
war and the deployment of U.S. troops, 
but I also believe that the President 
has the authority and, indeed, the re-
sponsibility to protect the United 
States from imminent threats. 
The strike against Qasem Soleimani 
has reminded those hostile to the 
United States that we will not stand 
idly by while U.S. personnel are threat-
ened. It has removed the top terrorist 
leader from the arena, a leader respon-
sible for the deaths of hundreds of 
Americans. It has reduced, although 
certainly not eliminated, the risk to 
our men and women in uniform de-
ployed in the Middle East. 
I believe that the President’s action 
was justified, and I think this resolu-
tion is an ill-advised and potentially 
problematic response to the President’s 
action. 
With Soleimani’s evil influence re-
moved from the Middle East, Iran has 
the chance to chart a new course, to 
rethink its participation in terrorism 
and its oppression of its own people. I 
hope that Iran will moderate its activi-
ties, but, of course, we have to be pre-
pared for the likelihood that it will 
not. We have to continue to ensure 
that our words and actions make Iran 
and any other hostile nation think 
twice before attacking American citi-
zens. 
We have to continue to ensure that 
our military and intelligence commu-
nity have the resources they need to 
identify and to defeat any threat. I will 
continue to work to ensure that our 
military is the best prepared, best 
equipped fighting force in the world 
and that our intelligence professionals 
have the resources they need to protect 
our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Ohio. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from South Dakota. 
At 
the 
conclusion 
of 
President 
Trump’s impeachment trial, I heard 
some of my Republican colleagues, 
most of whom I consider my friends, 
say that the President would be chas-
tened by impeachment. Some of you 
told me you knew what he did was 
wrong. A number of Republicans told 
me they admit that he lies a lot. They 
would acknowledge extorting an ally 
for help in the 2020 Presidential cam-
paign wasn’t bad enough to rise to the 
level of warranting removal from of-
fice—even though Richard Nixon never 
did that; even though, just on the face 
of it, thinking of soliciting a bribe 
from a foreign country to help you in 
your reelection as President of the 
United States is worse than untoward. 
But you told me—many of you on the 
Republican side—that holding the trial 
was enough to check his bad behavior. 
You said things like this—and these 
are quotes, but I will not mention who 
they were because they were private 
conversations. You said: ‘‘I think he 
has learned he has to be maybe a little 
more judicious and careful.’’ 
Some of you said these publicly too. 
A reporter asked another of you wheth-
er Trump might see acquittal as a li-
cense to do it again, and you re-
sponded: I don’t think so. 
One of my colleagues said: ‘‘I think 
he knows now that, if he is trying to do 
certain things . . . he needs to go 
through the proper channels.’’ 
Another colleague said: ‘‘The Presi-
dent has been impeached. That’s a 
pretty big lesson. . . . I believe that he 
will be more cautious in the future.’’ 
Well, the President learned a pretty 
big lesson. The lesson he learned—be-
cause everybody, every single person, 
from the majority leader down the hall 
to every Republican sitting at this

desk and this desk and this desk— 
every Republican except for MITT ROM-
NEY voted to acquit. Every single Re-
publican voted to acquit, so the lesson 
is he can do whatever he wants; he can 
abuse his office because he will never, 
ever be held accountable. 
One Republican had the courage to 
stand up and do it. Every other Repub-
lican sitting at these desks said to the 
President of the United States: Yeah, 
it is OK. You have learned your lesson. 
Yeah, your lesson is that you can do 
whatever you want and this body will 
never, ever hold you accountable. 
So do you know what? And I thank 
the Presiding Officer, by the way. Do 
you know what? The President went on 
what we call a PR tour—a personal ret-
ribution tour—starting at the prayer 
breakfast—the prayer breakfast—the 
next day when he attacked and he at-
tacked and he attacked all kinds of 
people, 
continuing 
through 
to 
his 
speech in the East Room where many 
of my colleagues were in the audience 
clapping for the President when the 
President made these attacks on peo-
ple. 
They say he will never do it again; 
even if we vote to acquit, he will never 
do it again. But then they clap for him 
when he starts his personal retribution 
tour. 
He removed Colonel Vindman, a pa-
triot, a Purple Heart recipient who 
spent his life serving our country. He 
was an immigrant. He left the Soviet 
Union. He wanted freedom. He served 
in our country’s military. 
The President, when he attacked 
Colonel Vindman, mocked his accent. 
He grew up speaking Ukrainian, and 
his English was damn near perfect 
when I have listened to him, but he had 
a bit of a Ukrainian accent. He mocked 
his accent. And then he suggested he 
could be subject to military prosecu-
tion. 
He removed Ambassador Sondland, 
who was a Trump appointee, after he 
testified to the quid pro quo. 
Yesterday, President Trump contin-
ued this PR tour—his personal retribu-
tion tour—interfering at the Depart-
ment of Justice. I am not a lawyer. I 
know the Presiding Officer is. Most of 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
are. But they know a President doesn’t 
interfere with the Department of Jus-
tice. As part of his personal retribution 
tour, he is interfering there. He is 
strong-arming appointees to overrule 
the decision of career prosecutors. 
Do you know what? These career 
prosecutors withdrew in protest. One of 
them resigned from the Department— 
more on that later. 
Late last night, when the country’s 
eyes were on the primary in New 
Hampshire, the President of the United 
States was on part of this retribution 
tour, and my colleagues had said: Oh, 
no, he has learned from impeachment. 
Well, he hasn’t. He has learned he can 
get away with stuff. He yanked his own 
Treasury nominee, who was working on 
terrorist 
financing 
and 
financial 
crimes, former U.S. Attorney Jessie 
Liu, who had worked as U.S. Attorney 
for the District of Columbia and had 
worked on, among other things, over-
sight of prosecutions from Special 
Counsel Mueller’s investigations. The 
Treasury Department has offered zero 
explanation. I am going to get a chance 
in a few minutes to ask the Treasury 
Secretary, coming in front of my com-
mittee, why they are withdrawing her 
nomination 48 hours before her con-
firmation hearing. 
We can take a guess at why President 
Trump pulled down her nomination. 
She oversaw the U.S. attorneys pros-
ecuting President Trump’s criminal as-
sociates, his political operatives, like 
Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, and Roger 
Stone. 
This is so obvious. There were people 
out there who displeased the President. 
One of them was doing his public duty. 
He is career military and had fled the 
Soviet Union. He was speaking under 
oath about what the President had 
done because he knew it was wrong to 
solicit a bribe from a foreign country. 
Another was a lawyer that oversaw the 
prosecution of some of the President’s 
political 
operatives 
and 
political 
hacks—criminals, as it turned out. 
They oversaw the prosecution. The 
President 
is 
attacking 
them. 
The 
President is using his power to attack 
him. 
My colleagues—who sit at this desk, 
and this desk, and this desk, and this 
desk on the Senate floor—think it is 
OK to acquit him and then tell me that 
he is going to quit acting the way he 
acts. 
No sentient human being, including 
the Presiding Officer, would possibly 
think that way. Ms. Liu was scheduled 
to testify under oath before members 
of both parties at our hearing in the 
Banking Committee tomorrow morn-
ing. We need answers as to what she 
would have said. Were there discus-
sions and decisions she was part of as 
U.S. attorney involving the President’s 
associates that he didn’t like? Was he 
afraid more would come out about the 
actions of some of the President’s asso-
ciates, the criminal actions? Was she 
aware of efforts by the President and 
his political appointees to interfere in 
the operation of our justice system? We 
need a swift and thorough DOJ inspec-
tor general investigation of these pros-
ecutorial decisions. 
With every passing day, we don’t see 
a humbled President. We see a Presi-
dent unleashed. Again, he didn’t learn 
a lesson from impeachment. Actually, 
he learned a lesson from his acquittal. 
The lesson he learned is that he can do 
whatever he wants. He is a President 
unleashed. He is bent on turning the 
arms of a government that is supposed 
to serve the American people into his 
own personal vengeance operation—his 
own personal vengeance operation. 
I implore my colleagues: We can’t let 
that stand. 
The Department of Justice is sup-
posed to be impartial and immune from 
political influence, but it has become 
no more than a personal weapon, or it 
is becoming—it is not there yet, but it 
started to be—a personal weapon the 
President can unleash on his political 
enemies. 
As I said, I am not a lawyer, but I 
know enough to know the Department 
of Justice and the executive branch are 
not there to serve the President of the 
United States. The Department of Jus-
tice and the executive branch are there 
to serve the same people we do—the 
people of Ohio, the people of the Pre-
siding Officer’s State of Utah, the peo-
ple of Maine, Iowa, Tennessee, and 
every State across this country. No 
one—no one—should be above the law.

AMERICA’S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE 
ACT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, dur-
ing the State of the Union, President 
Trump called on Congress to rebuild 
America’s infrastructure. He specifi-
cally asked Congress to pass America’s 
Transportation Infrastructure Act ‘‘to 
invest in new roads, bridges, and tun-
nels all across our land.’’ The Senate is 
ready to answer President Trump’s 
call. 
America’s roads and bridges are im-
portant to every State, every commu-
nity, and every Tribe in the Nation. 
The quality of our roads affects every-
one. Our economy is built on a well- 
functioning road system that allows 
products from rural areas—like Utah, 
like Wyoming—to get to our popu-
lation centers. Interstates like I–80, in 
my home State of Wyoming, are crit-
ical arteries of commerce. America’s 
roads create American jobs, move 
American 
products, 
and 
they 
fuel 
America’s economy. 
In 2015, the U.S. transportation sys-
tem moved a daily average of roughly 
49 million tons of freight. That is an 
average of $53 billion worth of freight 
every single day. The quality of our 
roads has to keep pace. We must main-
tain and upgrade and, where necessary, 
build America’s highway infrastruc-
ture. 
Last July, the Senate Environment 
and Public Works Committee, which I 
chair, unanimously passed America’s 
Transportation Infrastructure Act. The 
vote was 21 to 0. I introduced this bi-
partisan bill with fellow leaders on the 
committee—Ranking Member CARPER, 
Senator CAPITO, and Senator CARDIN. 
This legislation will make a historic 
investment in our roads. 
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act authorizes $287 billion over 5 
years from the highway trust fund. 
That is the largest investment in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1010 
February 12, 2020 
America’s roads included in any high-
way bill ever passed by Congress. Our 
bill is going to help the entire country. 
Senators on our committee represent 
rural areas like Wyoming, Iowa, and 
Alaska and urban areas like New York, 
Chicago, 
and 
Baltimore. 
America’s 
Transportation Infrastructure Act is a 
win for them all. 
Over 90 percent of the money in our 
legislation will go to States through 
highway 
formula 
funding. 
Formula 
funding gives each State the flexibility 
to address its specific surface transpor-
tation needs. The formula-based ap-
proach has been very successful in the 
past. It effectively and efficiently de-
livers infrastructure money to States, 
and they can make decisions as to 
which projects to pursue. America’s 
Transportation 
Infrastructure 
Act 
maintains this important approach so 
States get the funds they need. 
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act also expands successful Fed-
eral loan leveraging programs. A single 
taxpayer dollar in one of these Federal 
loan programs can leverage 40 times 
that much in actual infrastructure 
spending. 
Between 
new 
authorizations, 
leveraging programs, State-match re-
quirements, and input from other com-
munities, our bill’s total impact on in-
frastructure will be nearly half a tril-
lion dollars. 
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act is momentous, and it must be 
responsibly paid for. When our com-
mittee passed the legislation, it in-
cluded a commitment that the bill 
should be paid for. The Environment 
and Public Works Committee doesn’t 
have jurisdiction over revenues for the 
highway bill. That is why I am working 
closely with Senate Finance Com-
mittee chairman CHUCK GRASSLEY to 
make sure this legislation is paid for. 
It is no silver bullet. We all need to 
find multiple sources of revenue. 
One thing the Democrats and Repub-
licans agree on is that the people who 
use the roads should contribute to 
maintaining them. This must include 
drivers of electric vehicles. Right now, 
the drivers of electric vehicles con-
tribute nothing to the highway trust 
fund. If these electric vehicles were 
contributing at a rate comparable to 
drivers in my home State of Wyoming, 
it would generate billions of dollars for 
road maintenance over the next dec-
ade. 
Electric vehicle fees alone won’t pay 
for this legislation, but it is an impor-
tant start. I am going to continue to 
work with Chairman GRASSLEY to find 
responsible ways to fund the legisla-
tion. 
It is time to make a historic invest-
ment in America’s roads and bridges. 
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act will grow our economy, im-
prove the safety of our roads, and en-
hance the quality of life for the Amer-
ican people.

WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I 
would like to rise in opposition to Sen-
ator KAINE’s War Powers Resolution, 
S.J. Res. 68. 
I have had a longstanding opposition 
to the War Powers Act. I think it is an 
unconstitutional intrusion on the abil-
ity of any Commander in Chief to de-
fend the Nation and to direct military 
operations. 
This statute passed, I think, in the 
1970s. It was a way to deal with the 
Vietnam war. 
I have always believed the best thing 
Congress can do when it comes to deal-
ing with military operations—long-
standing conflicts that it disapproves 
of—is to cut off funding. I think that is 
what the Framers had in mind. 
The inherent authority of any Com-
mander in Chief to defend the Nation is 
part of our constitutional checks and 
balances. The President is the Com-
mander in Chief of the Armed Forces. 
You cannot have 535 people planning 
and implementing military operations. 
That 535 would be Congress. Can you 
imagine what would happen if our Na-
tion had to respond in real time and we 
had to get 535 Members of Congress to 
agree on anything? 
This resolution is designed to prevent 
actions against the Islamic Republic of 
Iran without congressional authoriza-
tion. It does acknowledge in the law 
that we can take defensive action. We 
can always defend ourselves. I think 
that is inherent to putting people in 
harm’s way. 
I have been consistent over time. I 
have opposed the War Powers Act being 
used against all Presidents, Republican 
or Democratic. I will continue to do so 
because I do believe, from a national 
security point of view, this will create 
a nightmare for our country’s ability 
to defend itself. Every Commander in 
Chief has to have the latitude and the 
flexibility to engage enemies of this 
Nation in real time and to send mes-
sages that are clear. 
When the President decided to with-
draw from the Iranian nuclear agree-
ment early on in his Presidency, I sup-
ported that action. We are trying to 
find a way to replace it with something 
that is more sustainable and accept-
able to the region and the world. With-
out boring everyone with the flaws in 
the Iran nuclear agreement, I thought 
it was a bad deal. It gave the Ayatollah 
and his henchmen a bunch of money 
without their having to change their 
behavior. It was tied to their nuclear 
program and had nothing to do with 
their missile program or their being 
the largest state sponsor of terrorism. 
Now you see Iran has been acting out 
since this agreement has been signed. 
Iran has been involved in operations in 
Yemen, Lebanon, and throughout the 
entire region. It has captured Amer-
ican sailors on the high seas and hu-
miliated them. Its efforts in Lebanon 
put Israel’s very existence at risk by 
its flooding Lebanon with weapons that 
could be used to destroy our friends in 
Israel, and it is the largest state spon-
sor of terrorism. 
I applaud the President for standing 
up to the Iranians. They have attacked 
the largest oilfield in the world in 
Saudi Arabia, and they have attacked 
international shipping in the Strait of 
Hormuz. 
The President decided to use military 
force against Soleimani, who was a 
member of the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard and a commander who was on 
the international no-fly list—for lack 
of a better term—who was sanctioned 
by the U.N. I think he was a legitimate 
target of war because he had been 
pushing war against the United States 
for decades. 
We have had at least 500 to 600 sol-
diers killed in Iraq from IEDs that had 
been developed in Iran and had been 
used inside Iraq. They have been very, 
very lethal to American forces. 
Now we find ourselves in a position 
wherein Iran is getting more provoca-
tive, and the worst possible thing Con-
gress could do would be to send a mixed 
signal. 
I want the Iranians to know that the 
Trump administration would like a 
new deal and a better deal but that it 
has to occur through negotiations and 
that if they continue to dismember the 
region and develop technology that 
could destroy our friends in Israel or 
that could one day come to our home-
land, they will be met with all options 
on the table. 
The authors of this resolution are 
friends. Senator KAINE has had a long-
standing concern about the original 
AUMF that had come right after 9/11. It 
is one thing to try to rewrite it; it is 
another thing to use the War Powers 
Act to tie the hands of the President at 
a time when our Iranian enemies—and 
they are the enemies of the United 
States and the region and the world— 
are becoming more provocative. The 
Iranian people could be a great ally one 
day, but the Ayatollah is a religious 
Nazi, in my view, and I can’t imagine 
why we are doing this now. It makes 
conflict more likely, not less. 
If this passes, the President will 
never abide by it. No President would. 
It will be vetoed, if that is the appro-
priate way to do it, but it is going to 
have no effect on his ability to conduct 
military operations. It will have an ef-
fect on our enemies’ perception of the 
will of the United States to stand up to 
Iranian aggression. It will have an ef-
fect on our allies: Can you really trust 
America? Our friends in Israel are 
watching with great concern about this 
debate. 
I will oppose this resolution—the fun-
damentally flawed concept of having a 
statute that would restrict military

operations based on the view of 535 
Members of Congress. We can only have 
1 Commander in Chief, not 535. I think 
the War Powers Act, as it has been 
written, is blatantly unconstitutional. 
Having said that, we find ourselves at 
a time of choosing in the Middle East, 
for the Iranians are making calcula-
tions every day of how hard to push: 
What would the Americans do if we did 
this or that? I want the Iranians to un-
derstand that when it comes to their 
provocative behavior, all options are 
on the table. 
Let me tell you the scenario that I 
fear the most. The Iranians are now up 
against the wall because of sanctions. 
What if they reactivate the centrifuges 
that have been dismantled or at least 
mothballed? They have probably not 
been dismantled. What if they began 
enriching uranium at 20 percent? What 
if they went from 3.5 to 20 percent? 
Going from 20 to 90 takes months, not 
years. What would be the appropriate 
response? Would that be a hostile act 
under the War Powers Act? 
I know this: It would be an unaccept-
able outcome for the United States. 
I hope the Trump administration is 
communicating to the Iranians that 
any effort to have a nuclear breakout— 
a dash to a bomb—would be considered 
a threat to the United States, our al-
lies—particularly Israel—and would be 
met with military force if the provo-
cation were to continue. I can’t think 
of a more dangerous scenario in real 
time than the Iranians’ making a mis-
calculation 
that 
the 
international 
community—particularly the United 
States—will sit on the sideline as they 
try to ramp up enrichment and have a 
breakout toward a bomb. 
The regime believes that if it can 
ever get a nuclear weapon, it will be 
home free, that the world will back off. 
All I can say to the world is that con-
taining the Ayatollah with a nuke is a 
non-option for me. If you are in Israel, 
it is not even close to being an option. 
What you have to understand is that 
the Iranians are wanting to make a 
bomb, not build powerplants for peace-
ful purposes. They want a bomb for a 
reason—not as an insurance policy to 
guarantee the regime’s survivability 
but to enact a religious agenda that is 
very dangerous, very radical, and very 
real. 
People don’t want to believe things 
like this. After World War I, nobody 
wanted to believe that Hitler had a 
plan that included killing all of the 
Jews. People just thought he was bluff-
ing and talking, rhetoric-wise, just to 
grab more land and that he would be 
appeased if you just gave him one more 
thing. It is hard for peace-loving people 
to imagine that folks like Hitler actu-
ally exist and will do the things they 
say they will do. It is hard for us here, 
in the safety of the United States, to 
imagine that someplace in the Mideast, 
there is a regime that is bent on our 
destruction because of our religious 
differences. 
Here is what I do believe: If the Aya-
tollah had a nuclear weapon, he would 
use it, and it would be a competition 
for the first use. Would the Iranians go 
after the Sunni Arabs, who are the 
mortal enemy of the Islamic faith and 
the regime? Would they go after Israel? 
There is no spot on the planet for a 
State of Israel in the radical Shiite 
theology. Would they come after us, 
the greatest of all infidels? I don’t 
know where we would be—No. 1, 2, or 
3—but we would be in the top three. I 
do know this: Our Arab allies and our 
Israeli friends can never let that day 
come. 
The best way to prevent the Aya-
tollah from having a nuclear breakout 
is for Congress and this administration 
and every other administration to 
make it clear what will happen if you 
try. We were able to win the Cold War 
because all parties and every President 
adhered to the idea that we would 
stand up to the expansion of com-
munism. 
This is one of those moments in his-
tory in which I hope we do not mis-
calculate. The Iranians are watching. 
North Korea is watching. The world is 
watching. I am hoping that Congress 
will not miscalculate because, if we 
pass this resolution, the chance of war 
goes up, not down. The chance of a nu-
clear breakout becomes almost inevi-
table. 
I ask all of my colleagues to think 
long and hard about how they will vote 
today. You may think nothing will 
really happen if this passes because it 
will never become law as we know law 
to be in the United States. You are 
right about that. Yet you are wrong 
about the signal it will send. It will 
send a signal that will be picked up by 
the most dangerous people on the plan-
et that we really don’t mean it when 
we say: When it comes to Iran’s getting 
a nuclear weapon, it will never happen. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, in a 
few minutes, we are going to vote on 
this resolution to begin debate on it, 
and what most people would think by 
reading it is this is a resolution to di-
minish the chances of war with Iran. 
I actually think that if this resolu-
tion were to ever pass and actually be-
come law—or I would argue that even 
this debate we are having now, to some 
extent—potentially 
increases 
the 
chances of war, and I will explain why 
in a moment. 
First, let me start out by saying I 
don’t question the motives of the spon-
sors and proponents, the people who 
are in support of this. These are people 
with a long history of wanting to as-
sert congressional oversight over the 
conduct of armed warfare, and it is cer-
tainly something I respect. 
The problem is that their intentions 
and how this will be perceived by the 
audience that I believe it matters the 
most to right now, and that is the lead-
ership of Iran, perception and the re-
ality are two different things, and the 
perception is very serious. 
What is the perception? I can tell 
you, just moments ago, I went online 
before coming here just to see if any-
thing has been written about it, and 
here is what I found. It was just one 
headline. That is all I needed because I 
think this broadly captures the way it 
is going to be talked about in the press 
and all over the world. Here is the 
headline from POLITICO: ‘‘Senate to 
rein in Trump war powers after Iran 
strike.’’ 
The first paragraph goes on to say: 
‘‘The Senate is set to pass a bipartisan 
resolution . . . to limit President Don-
ald Trump’s authority to launch mili-
tary operations against Iran weeks 
after the U.S. killed a top Iranian gen-
eral.’’ 
That is the opening paragraph of that 
story. That is basically the way it is 
going to be reported, and I am going to 
explain to you why that is a problem. 
One of Iran’s objectives in the Middle 
East is to push the United States out of 
the region. They don’t want us in Iraq 
to help the Iraqis fight ISIS. They 
don’t want us in Syria. They don’t 
want us to have military bases any-
where in the region, including Bahrain, 
as an example, where one of our major 
naval fleets is headquartered. They do 
not want us in the Middle East. 
Their strategy to drive us out is at-
tacks conducted primarily by surro-
gates, meaning other groups—groups 
they have created, groups they spon-
sor, groups they arm. Their strategy is 
to use those groups to kill Americans. 
Their reasoning is, No. 1, if they use 
these groups, it gives them deniability 
so the world can’t condemn them. They 
will go on and say: It wasn’t us. It was 
some Shia militia or some other group 
that did it. So they think it gives them 
some level of plausible deniability. 
The second reason why they do it is 
they calculate that if Americans start 
to die in the Middle East, the American 
people will demand that we withdraw 
from the Middle East. So it is a pres-
sure tactic that they are trying to in-
stitute. 
They do direct attacks. As an exam-
ple, I remind you that just a few 
months ago they were out in the ocean 
putting limpet mines on commercial 
vessels, and there were people in the 
city arguing: We have seen no evidence 
that it was the Iranians. 
Well, 
it 
wasn’t 
Luxembourg. 
It 
wasn’t the Belgians. They are the only 
people in the region that had the abil-
ity to do it, but that is the kind of de-
niable attack that they seek to con-
duct and to kill Americans. By the 
way, the person who ran that program 
was General Soleimani. When I say 
‘‘general,’’ he really wasn’t a general.

S1012 
February 12, 2020 
He was a terrorist with a uniform on, 
but the point being is, that is the cam-
paign Iran is trying to carry out. 
When they decide what kind of at-
tacks to conduct against Americans, 
they weigh a couple things. The first is 
how many Americans can we kill be-
fore America retaliates because they 
don’t want a war with America. They 
do not want an open conflict with the 
United States. It is a war they can’t 
and will not win. So they are trying to 
see how many Americans they can kill, 
how much they can get away with be-
fore triggering a direct response from 
the United States, and part of the cal-
culus they use to determine that is our 
domestic political environment. 
I believe there is strong evidence 
that indicates—and I say this just from 
everything you see—that Iran already 
miscalculated 
once. 
They 
thought 
Soleimani could travel the region with 
impunity and plan attacks to kill 
Americans and nothing would happen, 
and they were wrong and they miscal-
culated. It was evident they miscalcu-
lated. It was evident by their own body 
language and the things they did in the 
days 
after 
that 
they 
truly 
were 
shocked that the President took the 
steps he took. Hopefully, it reset their 
deterrence level. 
We are in a period of time right now 
where it seems, from all indications, 
that Iran, at least in the short term, 
has decided to stand down on some of 
these attacks, but it is not because 
they have suddenly found peace in 
their hearts. It is because they are hop-
ing the political process inside of Iraq 
will force us to leave there. 
Eventually, if that doesn’t happen, 
they are going back to these attacks. 
They continue to plan them on a reg-
ular basis. They continue to prepare 
for those attacks to happen. What is 
going to happen when that moment 
comes and they determine: We believe 
that the threshold of attack, meaning 
the number of Americans we kill, the 
number of attacks we conduct—how 
brazen they are—we think we can get 
away with a certain level because in 
America—in America, the President, 
Members of both parties, do not want 
him to attack us. 
In fact, they would calculate: If we 
can even make it deniable, if we can 
even create some doubt that we were 
behind it and it wasn’t just some other 
group that was going to attack us any-
way, it is going to make it even harder 
for him to respond. 
Now, that is not the reality. The re-
ality of this administration is the re-
ality of what I hope anyone who would 
ever occupy that position would be, 
and that is, if they know and they be-
lieve that American lives are at risk 
and they have a chance to disrupt it, 
they will do so. I believe—and I know 
this President would—if Americans are 
attacked and harmed, there would be a 
strong response in retaliation. 
The President has the constitutional 
power—and I would argue the duty—to 
do both of those things. The problem 
is, the Iranians may not believe it. 
They may say to themselves: It is an 
election year. The President doesn’t 
want to start a war. There are Mem-
bers of both parties who have, as PO-
LITICO’s headline says, reined in his 
war powers and decide that they can 
strike or conduct multiple strikes and 
terrorist attacks and miscalculate and 
elicit a response—a strong response—to 
which they would have to respond, to 
which we would have to respond. That 
is how a war starts. 
That is the danger embedded in this 
resolution, not the intention of its 
sponsors, whom I truly do believe—I 
know they are standing for a constitu-
tional principle they believe in. They 
are not the problem. 
The problem is how this is going to 
be portrayed and how the Iranians are 
going to take it and what it will lead 
them to conclude they can get away 
with. 
That is why I say that passing this, 
having this go into effect, even if the 
President vetoes it, sends a message, 
whether you like it or not—and with 
all due respect I say this—whether you 
like it or not, the message that this 
sends is that, in America, Members of 
both parties do not want the President 
to respond militarily to an attack and 
do not want the President to act 
proactively to prevent one. 
That may not be the intention of the 
sponsors—I don’t believe it is—but that 
will be how it is portrayed, and that is 
a chance we cannot take. We are play-
ing with fire. 
An Iranian miscalculation, an attack 
that goes beyond our redlines on what 
we would tolerate, is going to lead to a 
strong American response, to which 
they would have to respond, to which 
we would respond in kind. Suddenly, 
that is how you find yourself in an es-
calating conflict and even a war. 
So I hope those who are thinking 
about supporting this will rethink 
their position because while your posi-
tions might be pure in terms of your 
constitutional views, the foreign policy 
impact—the real foreign policy impact 
that even this debate is going to have 
is to instill, in the minds of some in 
Iran, that there are certain kinds of at-
tacks they can get away with, and the 
President’s hands are tied by politics 
in Washington. That is a dangerous 
proposition and a fire with which we 
should not play.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S.J. Res. 68) to direct the re-

hostilities against the Islamic Republic of 
Iran that have not been authorized by Con-
gress. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, it has 
been more than a month since Presi-
dent Trump brought the United States 
to the brink of war with Iran by order-
ing the killing of Iran’s top general, 
Qasem Soleimani. 
Now, no one here mourns Soleimani’s 
death. He was a ruthless killer. He has 
American blood all over his hands. But 
decisions over whether to attack sov-
ereign nations or whether to send 
American troops to war are not deci-
sions for the executive branch to make. 
These are decisions that the Constitu-
tion vests only in the U.S. Congress. 
That is why we need to pass, on a bi-
partisan basis, the War Powers Resolu-
tion that is currently pending before 
this body.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1013 
February 12, 2020 
I want to come to the floor today to 
raise three issues for my colleagues— 
and I will try to do it briefly—sur-
rounding the President’s decision to 
use force against Iran and what the im-
plications are for us, both as a body 
and as a nation. 
First, when we are talking about the 
topic, I just think it is always impor-
tant to level set. I think it is impor-
tant for us to realize how much Presi-
dent Trump has thrown away. 
This is a President who is running a 
master class right now on creating cri-
ses that didn’t exist before he started 
flailing away in the china shop, and 
then this President claims we all have 
to get together behind his efforts to 
clean up the mess that he and his ad-
ministration largely created. 
Let’s just remember where we were 
with Iran when President Trump came 
into office. When President Trump ar-
rived in the Oval Office, Iran had 
stopped their quest for nuclear weap-
ons capabilities. They were compliant 
with an intrusive inspections regime to 
make sure they didn’t cheat on that 
agreement. 
Iranian-backed 
militias 
had stopped firing rockets at U.S. per-
sonnel in Iraq. In fact, those militias 
were actively working on a U.S.-led 
project—the eradication of ISIS. 
President Obama had unified the en-
tire world against Iran. Even Russia 
and China were working side by side 
with the United States to constrict 
Iran’s nuclear program. And with the 
nuclear agreement secured, this global 
coalition had essentially been teed up 
for President Trump, to be used to 
make new progress to pressure Iran on 
a next set of concessions, on their bal-
listic missile program and their sup-
port for terrorist proxies across the re-
gion. 
But President Trump threw this all 
away. And now, despite the sanctions 
that he has imposed on them unilater-
ally, Iran is more powerful than ever. 
We went from a construct in which we 
had the United States, Europe, China, 
and Russia aligned against Iran to a 
moment today where, on many issues, 
it is Iran, the European Union, China, 
and Russia aligned against the United 
States. 
How much ground have we lost? This 
town tends to view power only through 
a military prism. So we have kind of 
lost sight of Iran’s provocative actions 
because, 
since 
the 
strike 
in 
Iraq 
against our troops, we haven’t had 
front-page headlines about what Iran is 
doing. 
Let’s talk about that strike for a mo-
ment, because we need to make it clear 
that, contrary to the administration’s 
assertions, the Soleimani strike did 
not deter Iran at all. They levied a bar-
rage of rockets at our forces in Iraq 
that were designed to kill. Some sug-
gested that night, or the next day, that 
maybe their attack was calibrated to 
sustain minimal damage. Now we know 
that is not the case. In fact, it was cali-
brated to try to wipe out over 100 
American soldiers. They missed. But, 
of course, now we are finding out that 
they actually didn’t miss. At first, the 
administration reported no injuries. 
Then, it was a few. Then, it was dozens. 
Now the injury report is over 100. 
Thank God that nobody was killed. 
But let’s be clear. Iran fired rockets 
that injured over 100 American sol-
diers, and we didn’t respond at all. I am 
glad we chose a path of military dees-
calation, but nobody in this adminis-
tration and none of their allies in Con-
gress can pretend that we ‘‘restored de-
terrence.’’ 
Second, it is important to note that 
Iran is retaliating. They are retaliating 
all over the region. In Iraq they are 
stronger than ever before. They have a 
new Prime Minister-designate who is 
incredibly close to Iran. They managed 
to get a vote in Parliament—non-
binding, admittedly—to kick all Amer-
ican soldiers out of that country. We 
are still in the middle of a negotiation 
to try to keep some American military 
presence there to fight ISIS, but Iran 
has used this opportunity to get more 
and more embedded in the Iraqi infra-
structure. And the protests—the anti- 
Iran protests that were happening in 
Iraq—are no longer making headlines 
because many of those elements are 
now lined up against the United States 
instead of against Iran. 
Remember, Soleimani was working 
every single day to try to get American 
troops out of Iraq, and it may be that 
he gets closer in death to his goal than 
he did while he was alive. 
In Yemen, Iran is fighting back. It is 
hard to see into the relationship be-
tween the Houthis and the Iranians, 
but the Houthis are acting out in pro-
vocative ways that are fundamentally 
different today than they were prior to 
the death of Soleimani. They are re-
stricting humanitarian aid. They are 
launching 
attacks 
against 
civilian 
sites. We don’t know that the Houthis 
are undertaking these actions because 
of orders from Iran, but it is likely 
that it is not coincidental that the 
Houthis’ increase in activity in Yemen, 
further destabilizing a country that is 
really important to the United States, 
is happening at the very moment that 
Iran is looking for ways to get back at 
the United States for the Soleimani 
strike. 
Remember, ISIS and al-Qaida are in-
side Yemen. The wing of al-Qaida that 
has the clearest designs against the 
United States takes advantage of the 
chaos inside Yemen to recruit, to grow, 
and to expand their territory. So as the 
Houthis 
are 
further 
destabilizing 
Yemen, the enemies of the United 
States are potentially getting stronger. 
Iran is, once again, back on the march 
inside Yemen. 
Then, in Lebanon we had this mo-
ment in which there were protests on 
the streets that were demanding a Leb-
anese Government free of corruption 
and free of Iranian influence. We were 
this close to getting a technocratic 
government in Lebanon that might— 
that might—finally break the grip of 
Iran on elements of Lebanese politics. 
Instead of taking advantage of that 
moment, the United States decided 
that it was going to cut off aid to the 
army that was protecting the pro-
testers. The combination of that mis-
take and then the assassination of Gen-
eral Soleimani allowed Iran to upend 
the 
momentum 
that 
was 
running 
against Tehran inside Lebanon. 
Now guess what we have in Lebanon. 
We have a Hezbollah government in 
Lebanon. Instead of getting a citizen- 
focused technocratic government, we 
have an Iranian-aligned Hezbollah gov-
ernment in Lebanon. 
Iran is fighting back. They are esca-
lating. They may not be shooting mis-
siles at American military bases, but 
they are gaining ground. They are tak-
ing provocative actions throughout the 
region. 
It is really important for us to under-
stand that. It is really important for us 
to understand how we are losing 
ground in places like Iraq and Yemen 
and Lebanon and how much stronger 
Iran is getting as a direct consequence 
of the action that was taken without 
congressional authorization. 
My third and last point is this. Even 
if we pass this War Powers Resolution, 
this President is still going to main-
tain that he has a Mack truck-sized 
loophole through which he can run 
military action overseas without com-
ing to Congress. 
As for the President’s article II au-
thority, he has it. I am not denying 
that the President doesn’t have con-
stitutional authority to protect Amer-
ica prior to a congressional authoriza-
tion, but the President’s article II au-
thority has morphed over time into a 
monster, and Congress needs to do 
more than just pass War Powers Reso-
lutions to contain this Godzilla. 
For years, Presidents of both parties 
have stretched executive war-making 
power too far. I have been on this floor 
criticizing a Democratic President— 
President Obama—who I argued should 
have come to Congress for authoriza-
tion for airstrikes against Libya and 
should have come to Congress to ask 
for authorization before launching an 
offensive against ISIS, or waging drone 
wars in Yemen and Pakistan. But 
President Trump has taken this abuse 
to new levels, and the threat of falling 
into a new war with Iran, based on 
whispers of intelligence and without 
any authorization from Congress, is a 
real possibility that we have to take 
seriously in this body. 
In fact, I listened to an administra-
tion official this week make the case 
that the President was actually au-
thorized to kill Soleimani because the 
IRGC, the military group that he led, 
was listed by the administration as a 
terrorist organization. 
I know that many of my colleagues 
have heard the administration make 
elements of this argument as well. 
That is a ridiculous argument that 
fails on its face. Remember, the admin-
istration, not Congress, designates who

is on the terrorist list, so you cannot 
argue that the executive-level designa-
tion of a terrorist group is a declara-
tion of war. It is not even a debatable 
proposition, but the administration is 
apparently making it. 
So what I am saying is that we need 
to be looking toward the reform of the 
war powers process more broadly. The 
overreach of multiple administrations 
proves the need for an enforcement 
mechanism for Congress and, more spe-
cifically, definitions around the cir-
cumstances in which a President can 
use force before coming to Congress—a 
new War Powers Act. It should sunset 
the existing authorizations of military 
force and force us to come back to the 
table and write new authorizations for 
the military engagements that we still 
need to be in overseas, and it should 
create templates for new authoriza-
tions of military force that include rea-
sonable sunset provisions on those new 
AUMFs and protections to make sure 
that those authorizations don’t get 
stretched to cover groups and geo-
graphic areas that were never con-
templated by the legislators who draft-
ed the initial authorizations. 
For many folks, it feels all too famil-
iar to be down here today having this 
argument over the President’s military 
escalation with Iran. We are talking 
about 
manipulated 
intelligence, 
a 
drumbeat of war. We are listening to 
the administration and its advocates 
bully Congress and the American peo-
ple into avoiding this debate—the sug-
gestion that, by questioning U.S. mili-
tary objectives overseas, we are some-
how hurting the troops. 
It all brings back these flashbacks of 
the disastrous path to war in Iraq. This 
vote is essential, in my mind, so that 
we warn ourselves against going back 
down that wretched path again. So, 
yes, let’s pass this resolution, but we 
can’t stop there. Congress needs to do 
our job to reform the war powers sys-
tem so that this President and future 
Presidents of both parties respect both 
Congress’s role and the deepest respon-
sibility that we all have to the Amer-
ican people when we make a decision to 
go to war. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss my concerns with re-
spect to Iran and to express my support 
for the Kaine resolution, of which I am 
a cosponsor. 
No American mourns the death of 
Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, and 
my thoughts remain with the service-
members who were injured by Iran’s re-
taliatory ballistic missile attacks in 
Iraq. The President was wrong to di-
minish their wounds by referring to 
them as ‘‘headaches.’’ Traumatic brain 
injuries are serious, and the Presi-
dent’s comments undermine efforts to 
educate our military personnel about 
their potentially lasting consequences. 
Unfortunately, the President still does 
not seem to grasp that his words and 
actions have real consequences. 
Tensions with Iran and the potential 
for miscalculation remain exception-
ally high. We are likely in a period of 
calm before the storm. No serious ana-
lyst doubts there will be a future Ira-
nian violent reaction to the death of 
Soleimani and continued pressure by 
the United States. 
This temporary calm is the result of 
several 
factors. 
First, 
Soleimani’s 
death has caused a disruption in the 
command and control of the IRGC Quds 
Force. He is not irreplaceable, but he is 
very difficult to replace. Second, Iran’s 
principle objective in Iraq is to expel 
the United States, to get them to leave 
Iraq. 
The killing of Soleimani has given 
Iran political leverage it did not imag-
ine, and violence at this time could dis-
sipate that advantage, especially as 
Iraqi political leadership remains in 
flux. Finally, the tragic downing of the 
Ukrainian airliner swiftly reversed an 
outpouring of nationalistic ardor in 
Iran, with renewed criticism of the 
Ayatollah. Again, Iranian violence in 
Iraq or elsewhere at this time could ex-
acerbate internal opposition. 
The Iranians are likely to continue 
to act via proxies. For example, Ira-
nian-backed Shia militia in Iraq have 
signaled their intent to avenge the 
death of Popular Mobilization Forces 
Deputy Commander Muhandis, who 
was killed along with Soleimani. 
Our national security interests re-
lated to Iran, Iraq, and the counter- 
ISIS campaign are on a negative tra-
jectory because of the administration’s 
policies and the impulsive decision 
making we have seen. Since coming 
into office, the Trump administration 
has waged a maximum pressure cam-
paign against Iran that has included 
crippling 
sanctions, 
the 
unilateral 
withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, 
and now the killing of Soleimani. 
Secretary Pompeo and the President 
have stated that the goal of this cam-
paign is allegedly to bring Iran to the 
negotiating table, but it instead has 
had the opposite effect of driving Iran 
so far into a corner that it now sees lit-
tle downside to escalating and direct 
conflict with our country. In addition, 
the ripple effect of the so-called max-
imum pressure campaign has resulted 
in the following: the disruption of 
counterterrorism operations in Syria 
and Iraq to defeat ISIS; the direction 
from the Iraqi Parliament to remove 
U.S. troops from Iraq; the resumption 
of Iran’s nuclear program; and the 
growing diplomatic distance of the 
United States from our traditional al-
lies and partners. That is not what 
anyone would call a win. It should be 
clear to all that these policies are not 
working. 
The administration continues to let 
events in the region dictate our re-
sponse rather than proactively and 
strategically shaping them, in collabo-
ration with our allies and partners, in 
a way that benefits U.S. national secu-
rity and foreign policy objectives. We 
should take the opportunity now to 
step back from the brink of conflict, 
engage in real diplomacy with Iran, 
and to rebuild our relationship with 
Iraq. We need a diplomatic channel, ei-
ther directly or through third parties, 
to avoid miscalculation on either side 
that could lead to military conflict. 
Such efforts in Iraq, however, have 
been made all the more difficult be-
cause of our reduced diplomatic pres-
ence in Baghdad. Indeed, according to 
the inspector general for Operation In-
herent Resolve, the State Department 
has indicated that—in his words—‘‘the 
ordered departure . . . has affected all 
operations of Mission Iraq, and has 
limited the Mission’s ability to help 
Iraq become a more resilient, inde-
pendent, democratic country, and to 
support counter-ISIS efforts.’’ 
Unfortunately, the situation at the 
U.S. Embassy in Iraq is indicative of 
our country’s entire diplomatic struc-
ture, which has been hollowed out and 
hampered at every turn. I am particu-
larly concerned that Secretary Pompeo 
has not assumed the traditional role of 
the Secretary of State in advocating 
for diplomatic options but, instead, has 
been the loudest voice in the adminis-
tration for violence and confrontation. 
Weaponizing diplomacy as the first 
step, rather than the last, is a sure 
path to diplomatic failure. 
War with Iran is not inevitable, but 
the risk that we stumble into conflict 
because of the President’s misguided 
policies has never been higher. As dic-
tated by the Constitution, the decision 
to take the Nation to war rests solely 
with the Congress. The Kaine resolu-
tion is an important step in preserving 
the constitutional role of Congress in 
matters of national security. 
Some have argued that Congress 
should not debate the issues of hos-
tilities with Iran. They claim that 
questioning the President’s policies 
means one is not an opponent of the 
Iranian regime. I wholeheartedly dis-
agree. Before being sent to war, our 
troops deserve to know that the Nation 
has determined the objectives of the 
armed conflict to be valid and worthy 
of their potential sacrifice. Our mili-
tary men and women deserve to know 
that they have a clear mission and that 
they have the full backing of not only 
the Congress but also the American 
people whom we represent. 
The administration not only owes 
the American people a transparent ex-
planation for escalating conflict with 
Iran but also a credible strategy to 
conclude hostilities, if they occur, and 
ensure an enduring peace. As we have 
painfully experienced in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan over much of the last two 
decades, securing the peace is no easy 
task. 
I am also deeply troubled by the 
evolving and, at times, contradictory 
justifications offered by the adminis-
tration for the killing of Soleimani. 
Even in a highly classified briefing to 
Senators 
following 
the 
strike 
on 
Soleimani, the administration failed to 
provide relevant details. There is sim-
ply no justification for refusing to

February 12, 2020 
share intelligence with Congress that 
underpins the administration’s assess-
ment that Soleimani posed an ‘‘immi-
nent threat’’ to Americans in the re-
gion. Determining imminence requires 
a careful and thorough analysis of both 
the immediate intent and the imme-
diate capabilities of the enemy. The 
administration has not provided a suf-
ficient response to the Senate on either 
point. 
The President has repeatedly dem-
onstrated a willingness not just to 
bend the facts but to indulge in out-
right fabrications. This behavior is par-
ticularly concerning and unacceptable 
when it may result in the deployment 
of troops into harm’s way. Congress 
has a responsibility to demand and, if 
necessary, challenge the basis for as-
sertions that could be used to take this 
country to war. 
We must not repeat the mistakes 
that led us to war in Iraq in 2003. I 
voted against that conflict, in part be-
cause I believed it was an unnecessary 
war of choice and the Bush administra-
tion had not provided the American 
people with a sober assessment of the 
likely costs or the nature of the threat. 
Going to war in Iraq took our focus 
off the priority effort to defeat al- 
Qaida and consolidate gains in Afghan-
istan, a decision that has contributed 
to our inability to secure the country 
in the years since. Once again, we are 
risking an avoidable conflict in the 
Middle East at the expense of our ef-
forts to ensure the enduring defeat of 
ISIS and to place increased emphasis 
on the great power competition with 
China and Russia, in line with the Na-
tional Defense Strategy. 
Conflict with Iran is not a hypo-
thetical proposition given the steadily 
escalating cycle of violence we have 
witnessed over the past 2 years, which 
has ultimately led to the outbreak of 
conventional military action between 
the United States and Iran involving 
the killing of Soleimani and Iran’s re-
taliatory ballistic missile strikes in 
Iraq. 
Iran has also announced that it will 
no longer comply with constraints 
placed on its nuclear program by the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or 
the JCPOA, likely resulting in a reduc-
tion 
of 
the 
so-called 
‘‘breakout’’ 
timeline for Iran to produce enough 
fissile material for a nuclear weapon. 
Meanwhile, President Trump has de-
clared repeatedly that he will not allow 
Iran to acquire such a weapon. Absent 
capitulation by Iran or a change in 
course by the administration, the 
President appears to be creating a situ-
ation wherein his only option is mili-
tary action when it comes to pre-
venting Iran from acquiring a nuclear 
weapon. However, we have received no 
assurances that this administration 
would consult with Congress and seek 
authorization in advance if it believed 
it needed to take such military action. 
Congress cannot stand idly by as the 
President careens toward possible con-
flict. 
The potential of conflict with Iran 
has already upended the priorities out-
lined in the President’s own National 
Defense Strategy, led to the deploy-
ment of nearly 20,000 U.S. troops to the 
region in the last year, disrupted our 
operations against ISIS, and made 
Americans less safe. 
The 
administration’s 
ill-conceived 
approach has not worked, and the time 
has come to try real and sustained di-
plomacy rather than relying on blind 
faith in the power of coercion. I urge 
the President to change course and en-
gage with our allies and partners with 
the goal of seeking a diplomatic solu-
tion to the current situation imme-
diately. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ORGAN ALLOCATION SYSTEM 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, Missou-
rians and many of our closest neigh-
bors waiting for the life-changing mo-
ment that happens when you have a 
liver transplant now have to have one 
more hurdle in the process that they 
have to go through to make that hap-
pen. There is a new, and I think ter-
ribly flawed, organ allocation policy. 
Senator MORAN and I have really led 
an effort to slow this down. We have 
both been the chairman of the Health 
and Human Services Appropriations 
Committee. We understand how that 
agency is supposed to work and how 
some of these healthcare issues are 
supposed to be handled. 
Frankly, I don’t think either one of 
us think this one has been handled in 
the right way. With the policy we see 
today, nearly half the country is dis-
advantaged by a new policy that has 
been put in place. 
It used to be that when someone do-
nated 
a 
liver, 
those 
organs 
were 
matched with the transplant can-
didates, first at the local level, then re-
gionally, and finally at the national 
level. It is my belief, and I think Sen-
ator MORAN’s belief, that when you 
know your neighbors are going to ben-
efit from that decision, you are more 
likely to make the decision that you 
want to be part of that organ donor 
community. In the neighborhood where 
we live and where the Presiding Officer 
lives, I think people have approached 
this in a pretty dynamic way, wanting 
to be part of that. 
In Missouri, 17 percent of people are 
organ donors or at least willing to be 
organ donors. Other States in the Mid-
west and the South and, frankly, the 
rural parts of the country just simply 
have the highest donation rates of peo-
ple who are willing to be an organ 
donor. That is not the case everywhere. 
In New York, for example, 32 percent of 
people are organ donors. There is a big 
difference between 73 percent and 32 
percent. I don’t know how much of that 
difference relates to the fact that in 
Missouri and Kansas and Arkansas and 
other places, people look at this and 
they think: If I am willing to be an 
organ donor, then people I know—peo-
ple whom my kids go to church with, 
go to school with, people we go to 
church with, people we see in the gro-
cery store—have a better chance, if 
they have that crisis in their life, to 
benefit from it than others do. 
On February 4, a new policy went 
into effect that will take livers that 
were specifically donated by Missou-
rians and allocate them to other parts 
of the country. You will no longer 
know, if you are an organ donor, that 
the people who live closest to you have 
the greatest chance of getting that 
organ that you have been willing to do-
nate. The change in liver allocation 
means that roughly 32 percent fewer 
liver transplants will happen in Mis-
souri than will happen otherwise. 
Senator MORAN is joining me here on 
the floor. We have both talked about 
this a lot. We had the group come into 
our offices. They are supposed to be 
making this system work. In Missouri, 
we have six transplant centers. We cur-
rently have 109 people on the trans-
plant list—10 of them are younger than 
18 years old—and they simply will not 
have as good an opportunity or likeli-
hood to have a transplanted, lifesaving 
liver than they would have had before. 
It is not just Missourians who suffer. 
As much as 40 percent of the country 
will see a decrease in what was avail-
able to them. In my view, this was not 
decided by transplant experts. Most of 
them have talked to us, in fact, about 
their concerns about having to trans-
port—in this case again, livers—longer 
distances, having to take more time 
and expense to get that organ than 
they would otherwise. 
It was decided by what appears to be 
an 
unaccountable 
government 
con-
tractor—at least unaccountable to us. 
We have talked to them about this. We 
have been trying to make a case that 
makes sense and trying to make them 
not rush through this, but they did. 
The contractor in this case serves as 
the administrator of the organ alloca-
tion system and is the determiner of 
who gets the organ. It seems to me 
that there is a conflict there. Contrac-
tors held a contract for nearly 35 years. 
Again, it seems to me that competition 
might be a good thing here. 
This policy became a policy without 
due process, without transparency, and 
I think without fully evaluating the 
consequences. I think it was rushed. In 
fact, even the Department of Health 
and Human Services—I will mention 
again, Senator MORAN
and I have 
chaired their appropriating committee, 
and we shared our concerns on this. 
They failed to fully exercise the au-
thority they had. 
I turn to Senator MORAN now. I think 
we can do that based on how we asked

for this time. I join him as he talks 
about his concerns and my concerns. 
We had people come to us and talk 
about this and how important it is. I 
am glad to join him on the floor today. 
I am disappointed for people in both 
of our States and in our part of the 
country, really, who are going to be 
disadvantaged by this new policy, 
where significant donors where we live 
are going to be having their donations 
sent to States where people simply 
don’t sign up to be part of this process. 
If they did, there would have been no 
interest in changing the other system. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise to 
support the remarks of my colleague 
from Missouri, Senator BLUNT. I thank 
him for his leadership. He is in an im-
portant position as the chairperson of 
the Health, Education, and Labor Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, which is 
responsible for appropriating funds to 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services. I serve on that subcommittee 
with him. He is a leader in so many 
ways. 
I am so pleased that we are allies in 
this issue of life and death for Kansans 
and Missourians. To my colleagues on 
the Senate floor, it is really a life-and- 
death issue for many of your constitu-
ents across the country but particu-
larly in rural areas, in the Midwest, 
and in the South. 
The decisions that are being made 
have huge consequences that will affect 
families, individuals, and their lives 
today and for years to come. I express 
my concerns and my deeply held belief 
that the Department of Health and 
Human Services is failing to do its job. 
Their harmful actions will damage the 
liver allocation policy in this country 
in the way I just described. 
The policy discussion we are having 
here today is important. It is impor-
tant any day, but it is relevant since 
National Donor Day is this Friday, 
February 14. 
I want to take a moment to thank 
those across Kansas and Missouri and 
around the country who have donated 
their organs to give that gift of life. 
Senator BLUNT is right. I think there is 
a tendency on the part of people to do-
nate an organ knowing that some-
body—maybe they don’t necessarily 
know them, but somebody who might 
live down the street or live in the same 
community or live in the same State. 
There is a sense of community across 
this country that is being destroyed. 
The end result of that is there will be 
fewer donors donating organs for the 
lives of others. 
These changes to the United Network 
for Organ Sharing’s distribution policy 
will 
redistribute 
the 
organs 
from 
States and regions that have high 
organ donor rates to areas that have 
historically underperformed. This re-
sults in patients in Kansas and those in 
the Midwest and Southern States to 
wait a much longer time for the organ. 
I have spoken on this topic on the 
Senate floor before, as this destructive 
policy was pushed forward. I spoke in 
2018. We are still here today. The lack 
of interest and concern exhibited by 
those involved in this process is appall-
ing to me. I stand here today because 
of the outright refusal of the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to halt 
the implementation of this damaging 
and unfair health policy that has not 
withstood examination by either med-
ical experts or our Nation’s judicial 
system. In fact, the U.S. district court 
has been forced to place multiple in-
junctions on the implementation of 
this policy last year as HHS tried to 
force this policy upon patients across 
the Nation, despite a lawsuit from a 
collection of our Nation’s best trans-
plant centers. 
The organizations that are fully en-
gaged in opposing this process are the 
people who transplant the organs to 
those who are in desperate need of it. 
They are the experts—the surgeons, 
the transplant centers in universities 
and hospitals across a wide swath of 
the country. HHS has ignored the ini-
tial injunction order and began to im-
plement this harmful policy. They had 
to seek a second injunction in order 
force the injunction to be upheld. In 
explaining the court order, this district 
judge in the district of Georgia de-
scribed the policy as ‘‘difficult and 
wrenching,’’ ‘‘creating profound issues 
and institutional disruption’’ and con-
cluded that this policy will undoubt-
edly cause harm to patients, particu-
larly those in rural areas. 
There is also mounting evidence that 
the United Network for Organ Sharing 
and its CEO have acted in callous dis-
regard for rural areas in the Midwest 
and South throughout the development 
of this policy. These are the same areas 
that have the highest donation rates 
and play an enormous role in the life-
saving transplant system. The people 
who live there are the ones who are 
being harmed. 
Those who are crafting and imple-
menting this system continually dis-
regard the evidence that shows these 
areas are already suffering under the 
suffocating weight of HHS’s new pol-
icy. As I said before, this policy tosses 
aside all public concerns from patients, 
transplant surgeons, and hospitals on 
best practices to improve the avail-
ability of organs across the Nation. 
There is no reason to have a regional 
fight. There are ways to do this that 
benefit all regions of the country. 
It also carries the risk of decreasing 
those organ donations that will then 
damage everyone. This limits avail-
ability and access to donated organs 
and damages the ability for major 
transplant hospitals—in the case of 
Kansas, the University of Kansas Hos-
pital—to perform these services for pa-
tients. 
This is particularly frustrating be-
cause dating back to December 2017, 
the board of the Organ Procurement 
and Transplant Network has approved 
an equitable liver allocation process 
that served the entire community’s 
best interest. This was a necessary pol-
icy reform that took years of consider-
ation that would benefit the entire 
country, 
based 
on 
compromise 
by 
transplant experts, patients, and im-
portant stakeholders. 
That policy was abandoned. We were 
assured when it was abandoned by 
OPTN 
and 
Health 
Resources—or 
HRSA—that public comments would be 
considered. That policy that took years 
to develop and involved the valuation 
of experts and a give-and-take in a 
process was overturned so easily. We 
were promised we would have the op-
portunity for those who have concerns 
about this policy to have input, and 
the reality of that fact is that was a 
lie. It was not true. 
Many concerns made by patients, by 
transplant centers, by surgeons were 
never considered in OPTN’s rushed 
process to finalize the policy. The rea-
sons they were not considered was be-
cause of the overwhelming negative re-
sponse that caused the entire comment 
system to completely shut down. Peo-
ple across the country commented on 
it with such frequency that the ability 
for the telephone system to log the 
input crashed. Of course, did OPTN 
wait until they could get those com-
ments and consider them? No, they 
made the decision without that input. 
In fact, the president of OPTN has in-
formed many commenters in the trans-
plant community that their concerns 
over the new policy were not even read 
by the board that approved the policy. 
So the many transplant hospitals, 
surgeons, and medical professionals 
who had deep concerns and took time 
out of their busy days to express them 
were never heard. They were ignored. 
These are the people who are tasked 
with saving lives through the trans-
plants they perform each and every 
day. Yet their opinions were essen-
tially deemed invalid. It appears that 
HRSA’s and OPTN’s making policy in 
such a reckless fashion has become the 
normal state of affairs. 
Despite the continual efforts by Sen-
ator BLUNT and me to get Secretary 
Azar to review, to modify, to consider, 
to reconsider, or to put on hold this 
policy, we have had no success. Addi-
tional oversight is desperately needed 
to restore some semblance of common 
sense in the actions and policies that 
are being taken and deployed. 
I am deeply disappointed in the ac-
tions by Secretary Azar, HRSA, OPTN, 
and UNOS. This process has been 
flawed from start to finish, guided by 
not what is best for the country but 
how best to sidestep a specific, single 
lawsuit. Organ procurement and alloca-
tion policy is too important to be de-
cided in this fashion. 
Secretary Azar, the University of 
Kansas Health System typically per-
forms 8 to 10 liver transplants per 
month. Since this policy has been im-
plemented under your administration, 
it has performed zero transplants. This 
is as a direct result of the policy. At 
KU Hospital, current estimates are

that it may take up to 6 months before 
it is able to provide another one of 
these lifesaving donation organ oper-
ations. Meanwhile, those on the trans-
plant list in Kansas watch their wait 
times grow, and their hope begins to 
dwindle. 
This is really a lot about hope, and it 
is about saving lives, but if you are on 
a list that continually grows longer 
while you are waiting for that organ, 
what a depressing, discouraging cir-
cumstance for you and your family. 
Secretary Azar’s policy is causing di-
rect harm to the people of my State. It 
is time that he steps up and takes re-
sponsibility for the actions of his De-
partment, which are causing real harm 
to patients. 
These 
transplant 
hospitals 
from 
across Missouri and Kansas and else-
where have written the President and 
Secretary Azar within the last 2 weeks 
and have asked for a halt in the policy 
until we have had time to let a judge 
decide the issues in the court case and 
also to make sure that we ultimately 
get it right. 
I call on Secretary Azar to halt the 
implementation of this disastrous pol-
icy and save lives from being unneces-
sarily lost. 
Again, I thank my colleague from 
just across the State line, from the 
home of the Kansas City Chiefs, for his 
support in this effort. He has a voice 
that has to be heard and that will be 
heard, and I am pleased to be allied 
with him in his concern for the pa-
tients in my State and for the patients 
in his own. 
I yield to the Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this pol-
icy is shortsighted and wrong, and it 
was rushed to its implementation. 
There was no reason for any of those 
things to happen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
OPERATION HOMECOMING 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it 
is February 12, and I am here to re-
mark on an anniversary and tell a 
story. It is quite appropriate that Sen-
ator LEAHY should be here on the floor 
with me because he is a great friend of 
Vietnam and has done great work in 
the U.S.-Vietnam relationship. We are 
about to be joined by Senator CARPER, 
who flew as a Navy pilot in Vietnam. 
This story goes back to February 12, 
1973. February 12, 1973, was the day 
that our POWs were freed in Vietnam. 
I told this story to DAN SULLIVAN when 
we were having dinner together a few 
months ago. He said: SHELDON, you 
should tell that story on the Senate 
floor and put it in the Senate RECORD. 
So, at DAN’s suggestion, I am here 
today. 
What happened on February 12, 1973? 
Two things happened. The first was 
that the prisoners being held in North 
Vietnam were released at the Hanoi 
Airport and were delivered into U.S. 
custody, and that went quite smoothly. 
The North was organized, for the pris-
oners were there, and the planes were 
there. Our prisoners, who were released 
from North Vietnamese custody on 
that day—this one will look familiar to 
many of us here; he was our colleague 
John McCain—climbed aboard their 
aircraft and went to the Philippines for 
medical treatment. 
Down at Tan Son Nhut Airport, in 
Saigon, things were a little bit dif-
ferent. Huey helicopters had been sent 
off to the rally point at Loc Ninh, 
where our helicopters were to pick up 
27 American prisoners of war who had 
been held by the Vietcong, and that did 
not go smoothly. The helicopters took 
off. The military aircraft, with their 
hospital insignia, were waiting at Tan 
Son Nhut for our soldiers and Foreign 
Service officers to come out. Actually, 
the longest held POW in the group who 
was going out to the Tan Son Nhut Air-
port was a Foreign Service officer who 
had been held for more than 7 years. 
They were all waiting and waiting and 
waiting and waiting, and there were 
disagreements and uncertainties and 
suspicions. So the day on which the 
POWs were supposed to return and go 
to Tan Son Nhut wore into evening and 
then into night. 
While everybody was waiting, there 
were some dignitaries there. This was 
the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam at the 
time, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker. 
This was the Deputy Ambassador. This 
was the first time a U.S. Embassy had 
two Ambassador rank officials. It was 
because the operation was so big in 
Vietnam. The Deputy Ambassador was 
a guy named Charles Sheldon White-
house, who was my father. Because he 
was there and because I was visiting— 
one of a very small group of dependents 
who was in Vietnam at the time—I was 
there. I was on the field at Tan Son 
Nhut during that long day as we waited 
for the prisoners to come out and as we 
tried to get intel on what was holding 
things up, on why the helicopters were 
not bringing them back. 
The day became night, and they 
brought out huge klieg lights that lit 
up the field. I can still remember the 
bright insects flying around in front of 
the lights, against the dark sky, in the 
hot night, on the hot tarmac of the air-
port. We waited and we waited and we 
waited, and we did not know when this 
was going to happen or what had gone 
wrong. 
Then, late into the night, we finally 
heard the familiar ‘‘toka, toka, toka, 
toka’’ coming—the sound of the heli-
copters—which every person who spent 
time in Vietnam during that conflict 
remembers very, very well. Pretty 
soon, they came close enough that you 
couldn’t just hear them—you could see 
them. You could see the red belly 
lights flashing on the helicopters. What 
happened is something that I will re-
member always. Obviously, after many 
years like this, memories can fade a 
little, but I think I have this right be-
cause it struck me very much at the 
time. 
The helicopters came in, and they 
hovered in a row over the airfield. Now, 
anybody who knows helicopters knows 
that the easiest thing to do is to fly 
them forward. It is harder to hover the 
helicopter than it is to fly it forward, 
and it is harder to hover a helicopter 
near the ground, because of the vari-
ations in the ground effect, than it is 
to hover it up high. What is very hard, 
which shows a mastery of helicopter pi-
loting, is to be able to hover low above 
the ground in traffic, with other heli-
copters around that are beating the air 
and making it difficult to stay in place. 
So here came these helicopters. They 
lined up, one behind the other, at a 
hover—maybe 4 or 5 feet off the 
ground. You could hear the whine of 
the engines, and you could hear the 
beating of the rotors. The air was all 
kicked up by the wind that they had 
put up, but those pilots held that posi-
tion. 
I have never spoken to any of those 
pilots, but I took it as their last salute 
to their prisoner-of-war friends as they 
brought them out to freedom and, ulti-
mately, home. This was their way they 
could show their skills and salute these 
men who were coming home. 
Then all at once—it must have been 
by a signal on the radio—all of the hel-
icopters—and I remember maybe 8 or 10 
of them—settled down at once to the 
landing. All of the skids hit the pave-
ment. They all wobbled a little bit and 
then settled. The engines kept roaring 
for a minute. Then, on another signal, 
all of the engines shut off. You could 
hear them wind down, and you could 
hear the blades slow down, and you 
could hear the quiet fall over the Tan 
Son Nhut airfield. 
Out of those helicopters came these 
spectral men—these pale, undernour-
ished, often ill men. One had to be car-
ried out on a stretcher. One of them 
was photographed while greeting Am-
bassador Bunker. How glad he must 
have been to have seen a U.S. Ambas-
sador. I don’t know that there has been 
any time in the history of the U.S. For-
eign Service when anyone has been 
more happy to see a U.S. Ambassador 
than these men who came off those hel-
icopters were to see our Ambassador of 
Vietnam and to know that they were 
on their way home. With Ambassador 
Bunker and my father was also Fred 
Weyand, who was the MACV com-
mander—the 
overall 
commander—of 
U.S. Forces. 
One of the legendary Vietnam report-
ers, named Fox Butterfield, wrote 
about this evening in a story in the 
New York Times, and he closed out the 
story in this way: 
After the freed men had boarded the plane 
for the flight to Clark [Air Force Base], Gen-
eral Weyand put his arm around Gen. John 
Vogt, the commander of the Seventh Air 
Force. They stood looking at the [departing 
hospital] plane. 
‘‘It’s the greatest day we’ve ever had 
in Vietnam,’’ General Weyand said. 
I had the chance to share that day. I 
had the chance to see what those re-
markable helicopter pilots did in that 
final salute to their colleagues.

S1018 
February 12, 2020 
I thank DAN SULLIVAN for urging me 
to come to the floor and tell that story 
on this February 12 anniversary of 
their freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the 
distinguished Senator from Rhode Is-
land is still on the floor I recall that, 
just within the last year, I had the 
privilege of being on the lawn of our 
former Embassy in Saigon. I stood 
there with other Senators, Republicans 
and Democrats, and with officials from 
the State Department, and I was mes-
merized as Senator WHITEHOUSE
re-
counted what he had observed there a 
lifetime ago. 
I think every one of us had the same 
reaction. We stood there and looked 
around. We could feel the helicopters, 
we could hear the helicopters, but of 
course we didn’t see them. Mostly, I 
saw the face of my dear friend, the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island, and heard 
what he said. What he was saying ulti-
mately showed his pride in being an 
American. 
I thank Senator WHITEHOUSE for re-
counting that again. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. President, on another subject, 
last month the United States and Iran 
came frighteningly close to war. If any 
of Iran’s missiles had killed American 
soldiers at those military bases in Iraq, 
President Trump would have reacted 
very differently and, most likely, with-
out consulting Congress. 
Rather than the self-congratulatory 
statements by the President who de-
picted the brazen, ballistic missile at-
tacks against our bases that failed to 
kill any of our troops stationed there a 
victory, we could be in the midst of a 
calamity spiraling out of control. 
Obviously, I think of the soldiers who 
have brain injuries from the attack, in-
juries that the President dismissed as 
minor headaches. Well, those who have 
actually served in the military and 
were not able to get deferments from 
serving know that an attack like that 
can produce lasting injuries. 
This is the nightmare scenario we 
have to avoid. We have been on a path 
to war with Iran ever since President 
Trump recklessly abandoned the Iran 
nuclear agreement, with no credible al-
ternative strategy. There was nothing 
to replace it. 
Today, while the White House insists 
there is no need for the resolution we 
are debating because the danger is be-
hind us, the possibility of war with 
Iran remains very real. As we saw only 
a month ago, we could again find our-
selves on the brink of war with Iran at 
any time. 
For too long, this President and pre-
vious Presidents have sent U.S. forces 
into hostilities without obtaining the 
consent of Congress, and the Congress 
has been a willing party. The Congress 
has abdicated its constitutional re-
sponsibility as the sole branch of gov-
ernment with the authority to declare 
war. 
It 
has 
permitted 
the 
misapplication of open-ended and out-
dated authorizations for the use of 
military force. 
The result is endless wars the Amer-
ican people don’t support, at a cost of 
thousands of American lives lost and 
trillions of dollars spent that could 
have been far better used fixing prob-
lems here in our own country. 
No one denies any President’s right 
to act in self-defense, to respond to an 
imminent threat if reliable intelligence 
shows that such a threat exists. But 
neither is it credible to rely on an au-
thorization for the use of force to re-
move Saddam Hussein—an authoriza-
tion that was based on lies by the 
White House about nonexistent weap-
ons of mass destruction—to justify at-
tacks against Iran nearly two decades 
later. 
Not a single Member of this body who 
voted for that use of force in 2002—and 
I did not because I had read the intel-
ligence and knew the stories coming 
from the White House were not true. 
Not a single Member, though, who 
voted for that use of force can honestly 
say they could have imagined or in-
tended that authorization for the use 
of force in Iraq would be used to justify 
armed hostilities against Iran so many 
years later. 
A few weeks ago, a top administra-
tion official said it would be a mistake 
for the Senate to even have a debate 
about the President’s war powers. He 
said it would embolden Iran’s leaders if 
they saw that there are differences of 
opinion among us. Has he ever read a 
history book? Has he ever read our 
Constitution? He said it would be 
wrong for us to disagree on an issue as 
consequential as attacking another 
country, as though in the United 
States we should simply serve as a rub-
ber stamp for the President. 
That is so beneath the United States 
of America. That is so beneath our 
Constitution. It is so beneath the 
democratic principles we believe in, to 
be told by a top administration official 
that we shouldn’t even debate an issue 
like this. As others have said, includ-
ing Senators in the President’s party, 
that is an insult, it is dangerous, and it 
belies a fundamental lack of under-
standing of Congress’s role in this de-
mocracy. 
Others, including the President, have 
falsely accused Democrats of sympa-
thizing with Mr. Soleimani or even 
with the Ayatollah, both of whom are 
responsible for heinous crimes. That 
kind of baseless, partisan slander and 
fearmongering is what we have come to 
expect from this White House, but it 
belittles the Office of the Presidency, 
as does a statement from a top official 
that we should not discuss our dis-
agreements. 
But too many of our friends in the 
other party—unlike the way the Sen-
ate used to be—have remained mute. 
By saying nothing, they condone such 
reprehensible behavior. One can only 
wonder how they would react if the ta-
bles were turned and they were the tar-
gets of such despicable, ad hominem 
attacks. 
Under the Constitution, it is our job, 
it is our responsibility to debate and 
vote, especially if it involves war and 
peace and the lives of our servicemen 
and women and their families. 
I would make a suggestion to the 
President and to members of his Cabi-
net: Read the Constitution. And I 
would say to those in this body who too 
often ignore what the Constitution 
says: Read the Constitution. Think of 
the lives lost, the many more griev-
ously wounded, the families destroyed, 
the millions of innocent people forced 
to flee the carnage, and the huge 
amount of tax dollars wasted because 
of that fateful vote in 2002. A vote 
based on false pretenses. A vote that 
made the world less safe. We can’t af-
ford to repeat that unforgiveable mis-
take. 
This resolution, of which I am a co-
sponsor, ensures that debate will hap-
pen, and that we will have another 
chance to exercise our authority under 
article I of the Constitution and do 
what is right. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
VIETNAM 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, our Pre-
siding Officer, if I am not mistaken, is 
a veteran himself—I want to say Army. 
Navy salutes Army. Different uniform, 
same team. 
I want to express my thanks to Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE for his comments re-
lating to the Vietnam war. I stand be-
fore you as the last Vietnam veteran 
serving in the U.S. Senate, with the 
death of John McCain. 
I had the privilege of leading a bipar-
tisan congressional delegation—three 
Democrats, three Republicans—back to 
Southeast Asia to try to find out what 
happened to our MIAs in 1991—Viet-
nam, Cambodia, Laos. One of the peo-
ple with me in that delegation—amaz-
ing meetings we had with the brandnew 
leader of Vietnam, a Gorbachev-like 
character with whom we met during 
that visit. We carried with us to South-
east Asia on that trip a roadmap to 
normalize relations between the United 
States and Vietnam. Vietnam by that 
time was not North Vietnam, South 
Vietnam. Out of our meetings, we 
started something that went really 
well and led to normalizing relations. 
John McCain worked it here and John 
Kerry worked it here in the Senate. A 
bipartisan codel worked it in the 
House. 
One of the members in the codel was 
a former POW—was Air Force, shot 
down over Vietnam, POW for 5 or 6 
years—named Pete Peterson. He was a 
longtime friend and still is my friend. 
He became the first U.S. Ambassador 
to a united Vietnam all those years 
ago. 
I know every time I run down to the 
Lincoln Memorial and I run back to 
the Capitol, I run past the Vietnam

Memorial with the names of 58,000 
brothers and sisters with whom I 
served all those years ago. 
So I want to express my thanks to 
Senator WHITEHOUSE for raising up our 
colleagues, my brothers and sisters, as 
he just did. 
CLEAN ECONOMY ACT OF 2020 
Mr. President, I rise today with a 
message to our colleagues and to this 
world we inhabit: Climate change has 
become the greatest threat to our plan-
et. There are others, but this is the 
greatest. 
This image right next to me was de-
signed by climate scientist Ed Haw-
kins. From left to right, these are 
called warming stripes. In fact, this 
work 
of 
art 
is 
called 
‘‘Warming 
Stripes.’’ It visualizes our planet’s an-
nual average temperature from 1850 
over here to 2018 over there, going from 
deep blue to a brilliant orange and red. 
What this design fails to capture is 
just how menacing these rising tem-
peratures have been and will continue 
to be for our planet and what this 
means for all of us who inhabit this 
planet today and will in the years to 
come. 
Our rising seas are already at the 
highest levels ever recorded. Our Na-
tion’s leading scientists have warned 
us that if we fail to start seriously re-
ducing carbon emissions now, by the 
end of this century, we may well wit-
ness sea levels rise another 6 feet. I am 
6 feet tall. Another 6 feet of sea level 
rise puts a large part of the United 
States and, frankly, other nations 
around the world underwater—under-
water. The east coast and west coast 
won’t look like they do today. 
For America alone, that would result 
in an estimated $3.6 trillion—that is 
trillion with a ‘‘t’’—$3.6 trillion in cu-
mulative damages to our country’s 
coastal properties—think gulf coast, 
west coast, east coast, Great Lakes— 
$3.6 trillion in cumulative damage to 
our country’s costal properties and in-
frastructure over the next 70 years. 
I might add that the Flood Insurance 
Program for our country is, the last 
time I checked, billions of dollars and 
maybe tens of billions of dollars under-
water, in the red, already. 
While global temperatures warm, ice 
caps melt, and sea levels rise, we also 
know that the extreme weather we are 
witnessing throughout the world is not 
going to get better. It is going to get 
worse. The devastating hurricanes and 
typhoons, torrential rains and cata-
strophic floods, the heat waves and 
drought-fueled wildfires will only be-
come more dangerous and more disrup-
tive to our economy and to our lives. 
Let’s take a look at one of the places 
where that happened just last month. 
This is a real picture from Australia. 
It is not a movie; it is a real picture. 
This is Australia. 
The world watched in horror last 
month as bushfires scorched millions of 
acres of forest in Australia—an area 
the size of my native State of West Vir-
ginia. At least 25 people died in those 
bushfires, including 3 American fire-
fighters. Experts initially estimated 
that 500 million animals died in those 
bushfires. More recently, that was dou-
bled to 1 billion animals—1 billion, in 1 
country. 
Meanwhile, our country has been no 
stranger to tragedy and devastation 
caused by wildfires—including fueled 
by drought and heat—like those that 
continue to plague the State of Cali-
fornia. Scientists tell us that by 2050, 
we could face wildfire seasons that 
burn up to six times more forest area 
each year than today. I will say that 
again—wildfire seasons that burn up to 
six times more forest area each year 
than today. 
If we do nothing to address carbon 
emissions, the extreme weather events 
we are experiencing now will pale in 
comparison to the devastation that lies 
ahead. 
Last year, some 13 agencies across 
the Trump administration released a 
report that predicted that the United 
States could see climate-related losses 
of up to half a trillion dollars by the 
end of this century—half a trillion dol-
lars. 
If we do nothing, the effects from cli-
mate change could slash up to 10 per-
cent of our gross domestic product by 
the next century—more than double 
the losses of the great recession. How 
much is 10 percent of our GDP? More 
than double the losses of the great re-
cession. 
This is something provided to us I 
think by the United Nations and called 
U.N. Warning. In order to avoid the 
most catastrophic impacts of climate 
change, the world’s leading scientists 
have warned us that we need to limit 
global warming to no more than 1.5 de-
grees Celsius—a 1.5-degree increase in 
Celsius, period. To do that, humanity 
would 
need 
to 
collectively 
reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions to net zero 
by the middle of this century. Right 
now, we are not on track to meet that 
goal. I wish we were. We are dan-
gerously close to losing our only shot. 
As the latest United Nations annual 
‘‘Emissions Gap Report’’ made clear, 
collective global efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions are falling 
short, and time is running out. 
If we want to avoid the most cata-
strophic impact of climate change, we 
need to step up. We need to step up our 
game. 
This is a chart that indicates the 
countries that are not in the Paris ac-
cord. It looks like—I am looking at all 
these countries here, and I see only one 
country, ours, that is in red. Ours is 
the only country today that is not in 
the Paris Agreement. 
The climate crisis is one that can be 
solved only by everyone who shares in 
the plan working together as one. That 
is why nearly 200 nations came to-
gether in common cause to implement 
the Paris Agreement and why they are 
working together to find solutions to 
the climate crisis, but instead of lead-
ing the world in this fight, America 
stands alone. 
We know the EPA already has the 
authority and tools to reduce green-
house gas emissions, but under the 
Trump administration, EPA’s policies 
have been used to increase harmful 
emissions, not decrease them. Presi-
dent Trump is putting America in the 
slow lane while much of the rest of the 
world races toward a global clean econ-
omy. 
President Trump claims Americans 
must choose between a healthy econ-
omy on one side and a healthier planet 
on the other side. In the words of a 
good friend of mine, that is malarkey— 
or in the words of President Trump, 
that is—fill in the blank. Come up with 
whatever you do. 
Choosing 
between 
environmental 
progress and economic growth is a false 
choice. On the one hand, we do face a 
very real choice, one that was made 
clear in the U.N. report released this 
past December. We either act now on 
climate change or we ‘‘face the con-
sequences of a planet [that has been] 
radically altered by climate change.’’ 
I say let’s choose to save our one and 
only planet, planet Earth, and I say it 
is time for the United States to once 
again lead the world in this fight. 
The next chart we are going to take 
a look at is something called the Clean 
Economy Act, which we introduced 
yesterday with over 30 cosponsors. I in-
troduced with my colleagues—33 of 
them, actually—legislation that will 
put the United States on a path to 
achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The 
Clean Economy Act heeds the call for 
bold climate action while fostering 
economic growth that is fair for every-
one. 
The Clean Economy Act empowers 
the EPA to use the authorities and 
tools already at its disposal to reach 
net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 
no later than midcentury, 2050. This is 
the quickest way we can jump-start 
governmentwide climate action, by 
empowering agencies to use the tools 
they already have. 
The Clean Economy Act builds upon 
successful climate programs in States, 
cities, and private companies, and en-
sures 
that 
economywide 
climate 
change actions continue regardless of 
who sits in the Oval Office. Our legisla-
tion sets important guardrails to make 
sure all Americans reap the benefits as 
we move our country toward net zero 
emissions. 
Here are just three examples of those 
protections. The Clean Economy Act 
minimizes costs. First, EPA must 
maximize greenhouse gas reductions 
while minimizing costs to consumers 
and providing regulatory flexibility to 
industry. 
Our next floorchart shows that the 
bill prioritizes environmental justice. 
Under our legislation, the EPA must 
consider and protect frontline commu-
nities. We know climate change dis-
proportionately affects impoverished 
and disadvantaged communities. More 
often than not, these communities are 
downwind from dangerous pollution,

located near industrial facilities or fac-
tories, or located in areas that are al-
ready experiencing flooding and ex-
treme 
weather 
fueled 
by 
climate 
change. This legislation will prioritize 
input from and investment in those 
communities. 
Our next chart on the Clean Econ-
omy Act prioritizes American workers. 
The Clean Economy Act focuses on 
American competitiveness and on the 
American worker. Our legislation com-
pels EPA to use American workers, do-
mestic materials, and strong labor 
standards to get the job done—relying 
on our country’s talents to get to net 
zero emissions no later than 2050—no 
later than 2050. The Clean Economy 
Act also requires EPA to work with 
other Federal agencies on programs to 
protect and uplift communities and 
workers displaced or dislocated by our 
transition to a cleaner economy, such 
as in places like West Virginia where 
my sister and I were born. 
This legislation will not come at the 
expense of jobs or economic growth. 
Moving toward a clean economy will 
drive innovation and create millions of 
new jobs here at home. The Clean 
Economy Act is about realizing our 
true economic potential, potential that 
under this administration, sadly, has 
gone untapped. The Clean Economy 
Act hits what we call the sweet spot 
between organized labor, business com-
munity, and environmental group sup-
port. 
I just want to thank the many orga-
nizations that helped us in crafting our 
bill, the Clean Economy Act, including 
the 
Environmental 
Defense 
Fund, 
Moms Clean Air Force, the League of 
Conservation Voters, NRDC, Environ-
ment America, the BlueGreen Alliance, 
and the Utility Workers. I also want to 
thank the organizations that joined me 
yesterday in unveiling this legislation, 
including the United Steelworkers, Si-
erra Club, the National Wildlife Fed-
eration, and CERES. 
To say the least, it is disappointing 
that President Trump has decided to 
abandon the tremendous economic op-
portunity to create millions of clean 
energy jobs. There are already 3 mil-
lion. Sadly, for the folks in West Vir-
ginia and Wyoming and other places, 
they lost a lot of coal mining jobs. The 
country is down to about 65,000 coal 
mining jobs, but folks who can be 
trained to mine coal can be trained to 
create windmill farms off of our coast. 
Folks who have the skills to mine coal 
have the ability to create corridors of 
fueling stations for hydrogen and nat-
ural gas and to create charging sta-
tions for electric-powered vehicles in 
the heavily traveled corridors across 
our country. 
Part of what we tried to do in this 
legislation is to make sure that we 
looked out for those workers and to 
help make sure they have a place to go 
and ways to support themselves and 
their families while at the same time 
having clean air to breathe where they 
call home. 
I think it is shameful that our Presi-
dent has forsaken our country’s leader-
ship in this fight for our one and only 
planet for the sake of misplaced polit-
ical gain. That abdication of leadership 
will be a dark, indelible stain on his 
legacy, but while President Trump may 
not be up for the climate challenge, our 
colleagues and I are here to say to the 
world that the majority of Americans 
are ready for that challenge. We have 
faith in American innovation. We have 
faith in American workers to take on 
this climate fight and win. The Clean 
Economy Act will put the United 
States on a path to once again lead the 
world in the fight against climate 
change while lifting up America and 
American workers. 
This bill corrects our President’s fail-
ure to lead on this issue and directs the 
EPA and other agencies to move swift-
ly to address this serious problem for 
the good of our planet and for the 
strengthening of our economy and cre-
ation of even more new jobs. 
Famed economist John Kenneth Gal-
braith once said these words: 
All of the great leaders have had one char-
acteristic in common: it was the willingness 
to confront unequivocally the major anxiety 
of their people in their time. This, and not 
much else, is the essence of leadership. 
That is worth repeating. All of the 
great leaders we have had share one 
common characteristic, and that is the 
willingness to confront unequivocally 
the major anxiety of their people in 
their time. This, and not much else, is 
the essence of leadership. I am Tom 
Carper, and I approve that message. 
The Clean Economy Act is our mes-
sage to the rest of the world about cli-
mate leadership. The United States is 
preparing to once again lead the fight 
against this climate crisis. America, 
let’s roll. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I am 
sorry. Will the Senator from New Mex-
ico please yield? 
Mr. UDALL. The Senator from New 
Mexico will yield. 
Mr. CARPER. Thank you, Madam 
President, and I thank the Senator for 
yielding to me. 
Madam President, former Senator 
and Vice President Joe Biden was 
blessed with many wonderful staff 
members over the years, and one of 
them was John DiEleuterio. 
I would like to take just 3 minutes to 
mention him. He just passed away. He 
was a giant in the State of Delaware 
and also served in the military. 
REMEMBERING JOHN M. DIELEUTERIO 
Madam President, I rise today on be-
half of Delaware’s congressional dele-
gation, Senator CHRIS COONS and Con-
gresswoman LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER, in 
tribute to John M. DiEleuterio, a dedi-
cated 
public 
servant 
who 
proudly 
served our State and country through-
out his long career and life. 
John was what I call a happy war-
rior—in the military for many years 
and in his service to the people of Dela-
ware. He supported a multitude of non-
profits that focused on helping people 
in need. He was a person who loved peo-
ple, and they loved him just as much. 
John exemplified what it means to be 
the ‘‘go-to person’’ to get things done. 
His relationships and friendships with 
people throughout our State enabled 
him to get things done with speed and 
dispatch and, I would add, with a sense 
of joy. 
John’s persistence and innate ability 
to work a room and make connections, 
his strong work ethic and ever-present 
sense of humor was the core of what 
made John so successful. His impres-
sive career included serving as State 
director—and you know how important 
our State directors are in New Mexico, 
Delaware, and Tennessee. He was State 
director for then-Senator Joe Biden, 
his longtime friend and former Univer-
sity of Delaware classmate. They were 
classmates together for a number of 
years. 
His service included more than 30 
years of combined service as a deco-
rated officer in both the Delaware and 
Maryland Army National Guard. He 
had an impressive career for over 26 
years with the Campbell Soup Com-
pany as their vice president of human 
resources. 
In addition, John gave freely of his 
time serving all kinds of community 
groups, including serving on the board 
of the Delaware Military Academy, a 
blue-ribbon public high school. He 
served on the board of Freedoms Foun-
dation at Valley Forge, the Leukemia 
Society of America, the U.S. Service 
Academy Selection Committee, the 
Cavaliers Country Club, St. Anthony’s 
Communion Committee, and New Cas-
tle County Ethics Commission, among 
others. 
He was equally committed to his 
family, including his wonderful wife 
Marlene for 30 years, their children and 
grandchild, and the many friends he 
made along the way, and they are le-
gion. 
So on behalf of Senator CHRIS COONS 
and Congresswoman LISA BLUNT ROCH-
ESTER, I am privileged to rise today to 
evoke the name of our dear friend John 
DiEleuterio. People from many walks 
of life loved serving with him, loved 
being with him. I am certainly one of 
them. The people of Delaware and our 
country are very fortunate to count 
John as a fellow Delawarean, and it is 
a far better place to live and work be-
cause of his stewardship. 
I will close with the words of another 
beloved Delawarean who used to say 
this: If you want to be happy for an 
hour, take a nap. If you want to be 
happy for a week, take a vacation. If

you want to be happy for a lifetime, 
help people. Think about that. I will 
close with the words of another beloved 
Delawarean, who used to say this to us 
and to me: If you want to be happy for 
an hour, take a nap. If you want to be 
happy for a week, take a vacation. If 
you want to be happy for a lifetime, 
help people. That is exactly what John 
DiEleuterio did his whole life. He 
helped people. I said earlier he was a 
happy warrior. Boy, he was, and we are 
going to miss him. Thank you for al-
lowing me to add these comments. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. 
UDALL. 
Madam 
President, 
thank you for the recognition, and I 
very much appreciate Senator CARPER 
talking about the wonderful, young 
employees whom we have around us 
and the young people who come here 
who are dedicated and work, and we 
have some great ones on the commit-
tees. I see Mary Frances back here be-
hind you, and I have Matthew Padilla 
over here on my right. There are so 
many great young people that just 
come to Washington or live in Wash-
ington, and they are really dedicated 
to see that we do a good job. It is won-
derful to hear you talk about that 
young man. 
I rise to affirm the Congress’s con-
stitutional authority to declare war 
and to support the War Powers Resolu-
tion before us. The chilling events of 
last month bring into stark relief why 
this resolution is absolutely needed. 
The President brought us to the very 
edge of war with Iran by his attack on 
its top general. 
We must pass this resolution be-
cause, even if the President does not 
respect the plain words of the Constitu-
tion, the Members of this body should. 
Look at this chart here. Here they 
are, clear as day: The ‘‘Congress shall 
have power . . . to declare War.’’ The 
Congress alone has the power to de-
clare war. The President does not. 
I did not come to this view recently. 
I held the same view under President 
Obama’s administration. I spoke up 
against his plans for airstrikes in 
Syria, and I voted against an author-
ization for those airstrikes in the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee. So, 
whether you support war with Iran or 
not, I urge every single Member here to 
stand up for our Constitution and to 
vote for this resolution. 
Last month, as we were on the brink 
of war with Iran, the whole Nation and 
the whole world watched on edge, 
braced for conflict, bloodshed, and ter-
ror. Yet, to this day, this administra-
tion has not provided a serious jus-
tification for the strike on General 
Soleimani. The administration claimed 
the 2002 authorization for use of mili-
tary force against Iraq justified the 
strike, but the AUMF, which I voted 
against, authorizes force ‘‘against the 
continuing threat posed by Iraq,’’ not 
any threat posed by Iran. That author-
ization was passed in 2002, and here we 
are, 18 years later, and it is being spe-
cifically used to get us into another 
conflict. 
The administration claims Soleimani 
posed an imminent threat to U.S. 
troops, diplomats, and citizens, but the 
administration gave no convincing evi-
dence to the Congress or the American 
people that an attack from Iran on 
U.S. interests was imminent or that 
the killing would have stopped such an 
imminent attack. 
During the Senate briefing, when we 
asked questions trying to get real an-
swers about the evidence and why they 
didn’t seek congressional approval, the 
administration wouldn’t answer our 
questions. One Republican Senator, at 
the briefing that we had from adminis-
tration officials, called that briefing 
the ‘‘worst’’ briefing he had ever had. 
He said it was ‘‘insulting and demean-
ing.’’ 
While the President claimed on Twit-
ter, without evidence, that Iran had 
targeted four U.S. Embassies, his own 
Secretary of Defense disavowed that 
claim. We come to find out that the op-
eration was planned months in advance 
and was even broader than General 
Soleimani. That is not a response to an 
imminent threat. That is an unauthor-
ized and thus unconstitutional act of 
war. 
In the end, the President all but ad-
mitted the attack was retaliatory, not 
defensive, when he tweeted that any 
justification for the strike ‘‘doesn’t 
really 
matter 
. . . 
because 
of 
[Soleimani’s] horrible past.’’ 
This President has misled the public 
on many things, big and small. It is 
clear that he will mislead us on the 
most consequential matters we face— 
war and peace. He cannot be entrusted 
with the sole power to risk lives of 
American troops in war, and he does 
not have that power under our Con-
stitution. 
The President’s strike took us to the 
edge of an unauthorized war, but we 
didn’t get here overnight. The Presi-
dent’s unilateral decision to withdraw 
from the Iran nuclear agreement in 
May of 2018, combined with his disas-
trous maximum pressure campaign, de-
stabilized the region. Since we pulled 
out of the nuclear agreement, the 
President dramatically increased the 
number of troops in the Middle East, 
despite his campaign promise to do the 
opposite. 
Between May and December of last 
year, the President deployed an addi-
tional 15,000 troops to the Middle East. 
Days before the strike on Soleimani, he 
sent in 1,000 more Army and Marine 
troops. Post-strike, he sent 3,500 more 
troops. In response to our strike, Iran 
withdrew from the nuclear agreement’s 
limits on the production of centrifuges, 
uranium enrichment, and research, de-
creasing the time for Iran to acquire 
enough fissile material for one bomb. 
The Iraqi Parliament voted to oust 
U.S. troops from Iraq, which could lead 
to an increased ISIS presence. We have 
refused to leave the country, setting up 
a conflict with our ally Iraq. 
Our strike pushed the Iraqi Govern-
ment and the people of Iraq closer to 
Iran and unified the Iranian people 
against us just as protests against the 
Iranian Government were sprouting up. 
The region is still a powder keg, and we 
just don’t know when and where Ira-
nian proxy forces will attack our 
troops. 
Finally, worst of all, Iran launched a 
missile attack against U.S. troops in 
Iraq, risking American lives. While I 
am grateful no one was killed, I am an-
guished that more than 100 of our sol-
diers suffered from traumatic brain in-
jury from the attack. While the Presi-
dent said he doesn’t consider their in-
juries serious, I agreed with the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, who asked the 
President to apologize for that callous 
remark. The President’s insults to in-
jured servicemembers is appalling, and 
his injury to the Constitution is deeply 
troubling. 
We have a President who claims he 
doesn’t need congressional approval to 
go to war with Iran. He has actually 
said that, under article II of the Con-
stitution, he has ‘‘the right to do what-
ever I want as President.’’ That sounds 
like a claim of total unlimited power. 
That isn’t what our Constitution was 
about. 
The Founders of our Constitution 
would be shocked to hear that and even 
more shocked to learn that Congress 
refuses to act to assert its power. The 
Founders rejected the notion that the 
President alone should have the power 
to send the country into war. They be-
lieved it unwise to vest the President— 
one person—with that power. So they 
vested that decision with the people’s 
representatives, to make sure that any 
war would have broad-based support. 
That decision makes as much sense 
today as it did 230 years ago. It is our 
job, as the representatives of the peo-
ple, to decide whether to go to war. 
The American people do not want war 
with Iran. Yet, even if you disagree 
with the overwhelming will of the 
American people, the issue before us is 
not whether you would support war 
with Iran or not. The issue is whether 
we are going to uphold our oath to sup-
port and defend the Constitution. 
The War Powers Resolution before us 
exercises that constitutional preroga-
tive, ending hostilities unless Congress 
authorizes it. This President is fully 
capable of starting a war without get-
ting congressional approval or even 
without consulting with us. He has al-
ready proved that. 
The stakes are too high. We cannot 
wait until the next time he orders a 
strike 
he 
can’t 
justify 
with 
con-
sequences no one can predict. We can-
not wait until the next time he gam-
bles with American soldiers’ lives. Now 
is the time to set straight the bound-
aries, not only for this President but 
for future ones as well. Now is the time 
to vote for this resolution and to send 
the President a message that there is

no support in Congress for an unconsti-
tutional war of his own making. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to add my 
voice to the debate on the system of 
checks and balances that are essential 
to and that define our very democracy. 
I am here, in no small part, because of 
a series of events that unfolded slowly 
over 40 years, and then, with a sharper 
tempo, near the end of last year, cul-
minated in a strike by U.S. forces on 
January 3 that killed General Qasem 
Soleimani of the Quds Force of the 
IRGC of Iran. 
That precipitated a series of briefings 
and debates here among Senators and 
with our constituents in the country, 
and, today, after an important 51-to-45 
vote to proceed, we are debating this 
measure. This measure is S.J. Res. 68, 
from Senators KAINE, DURBIN, LEE, and 
PAUL, to direct the removal of U.S. 
Armed Forces from hostilities against 
the Islamic Republic of Iran that have 
not been authorized by Congress. 
I want to simply make a few observa-
tions today about the importance of 
the war making power and the role of 
Congress. 
In my view, we are at a critical in-
flection point in our Nation, one where 
history 
will 
question 
whether 
we 
served our Nation or served more par-
tisan or parochial aims. 
To be clear, I do not seek or want a 
war between the United States and 
Iran. I think our best path forward is a 
multilateral, 
several-nations-coming- 
together initiative to deescalate rising 
conflict between the United States and 
Iran, with so many—tens of millions of 
people—displaced from their homes 
around the world from conflicts rang-
ing from Syria and Yemen, to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, to 
the Central African Republic. There is 
conflict in many places in our world, 
and our country has seen what happens 
in the absence of effective diplomacy. 
But I came to the floor today really 
in no small part because, in the group 
briefings that happened after the strike 
that killed General Soleimani, a num-
ber of points were made that I think 
deserve to be addressed. 
One, a suggestion was made by one 
participant 
that 
simply 
debating 
whether the authorization for the use 
of military force that was adopted by 
Congress back in 2001 or 2002—simply 
debating whether that authorized this 
strike and simply questioning whether 
this strike should be authorized and fu-
ture actions authorized by this Con-
gress would weaken the morale of our 
troops and would send a signal to our 
enemies and adversaries of a lack of re-
solve by our Nation, and so we in Con-
gress should simply allow the Presi-
dent, under article II, which gives to 
him, the Commander in Chief, respon-
sibility, to simply exercise the over-
whelming capabilities of the United 
States and our tremendous Armed 
Forces to keep us safe and to push back 
on our adversaries. 
I don’t think anything could be fur-
ther from the truth. I actually think it 
strengthens our democracy when we 
engage in a robust and vigorous debate 
on this question. I actually think 
showing that we have confidence in our 
Constitution and that we in the Senate 
realize that, over decades, we have 
gradually allowed our central role in 
authorizing war to be weakened—that 
retaking some of that role is, in fact, 
showing confidence in our democracy. 
Let me be clear up front. I support 
the men and women of the U.S. Armed 
Forces, and I have great confidence in 
their ability to carry out their mission. 
I am clear-eyed about the threat that 
Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
poses to our interests, to the region, 
and to the world. As one of the world’s 
great state sponsors of terrorism, as 
one of the great sources of instability 
in the region, as a country that for 40- 
plus years has been genuinely opposed 
to much of what the United States be-
lieves in and tries to do in the region— 
I am clear-eyed both about supporting 
our troops and about the threat posed 
by Iran. But if we are to do right by the 
men and women of the U.S. Armed 
Forces, whom we ask to go around the 
world and to serve us and to sacrifice 
for us and to keep us safe, we can do no 
less than to ask whether we are send-
ing them with the full support of the 
American people. 
This S.J. Res. 68 begins with a simple 
but important finding: ‘‘Congress has 
the sole power to declare war under ar-
ticle I, section 8, clause 11 of the 
United 
States 
Constitution,’’ 
and 
‘‘Congress has not yet declared war 
upon, nor enacted a specific statutory 
authorization for the use of military 
force against . . . Iran.’’ That makes a 
simple point. 
Previous administrations of both par-
ties have overused the authorizations 
for the use of military force passed 
here in 2001 and 2002. An overwhelming 
majority of the currently serving Mem-
bers were not present for the debates 
that led to those authorizations, and 
the fact patterns and circumstances 
that led to their being adopted have 
long since passed into history. So if we 
in this Chamber are to exercise our re-
sponsible role, we shouldn’t simply let 
the President take the responsibility 
and possibly the blame for the conduct 
of war overseas; we should take that 
responsibility back on ourselves. 
In 2001, Congress authorized the use 
of force against al-Qaida and associ-
ated forces based on the deadly strike 
against the United States and our ter-
ritory that happened on 9/11 but did not 
authorize the use of force against Iran. 
In 2002, Congress did the same against 
Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, which is one of 
Iran’s greatest enemies, then and now. 
So, frankly, I think to suggest that ei-
ther of these former authorizations for 
the use of military force, or AUMFs, 
authorize this action goes way beyond 
its scope. 
I have heard from hundreds of con-
stituents at home in Delaware about 
their rising anxiety and concern, and I 
have heard from many both currently 
serving and formerly serving that we 
should do our job, that Congress has a 
role, and that we need to debate and 
demand a strategy from this adminis-
tration and a path forward that we can 
articulate and defend. 
We are in a scenario now where the 
possibility of military conflict between 
the United States and Iran is entirely 
foreseeable. 
President 
Trump 
has 
drawn a line in the sand, much as his 
predecessor did, and said: We will never 
let Iran have a nuclear weapon. 
With the United States having with-
drawn from the Iran nuclear deal, the 
JCPOA, and with Iran and our Euro-
pean allies increasingly further and 
further apart on their conduct and 
with Iran restarting centrifuges and re-
starting enrichment, it is not an un-
foreseeable 
moment 
that, 
whether 
weeks or months or years from now but 
quite possibly months, a team from the 
senior ranks of our military will go to 
the President and say: Here is a range 
of options. That might include striking 
Iran. That is a fact pattern that re-
quires Congress to have provided au-
thorization. 
Yes, I recognize there are exigencies, 
there are emergencies, there are mo-
ments when the President must take 
action to authorize our Armed Forces 
to strike in order to defend our troops 
and to defend our interests at home 
and abroad, but this entirely foresee-
able scenario—one which we should all 
be working to avoid but which is fore-
seeable—is exactly why I am sup-
porting the bipartisan resolution intro-
duced by Senators KAINE and LEE. 
The Senate must take back its re-
sponsibility for authorizing our Armed 
Forces to protect us overseas, and we 
need to show clear-eyed support for our 
Armed Forces and for the path forward. 
President Trump, like all Presidents 
before him, does not have the author-
ity to wage war without consulting 
this Congress. And Democrats and Re-
publicans are concerned about this ad-
ministration’s 
apparent 
indifference 
toward Congress and its critical role in 
deciding matters of war and peace. 
The House has just passed two meas-
ures to restrict the President’s war- 
making powers. The Senate needs to 
have that same debate, that same dis-
cussion, and needs to take up and pass 
this resolution. 
This is how our system of govern-
ment works best—through respectful 
disagreement, through thoughtful, in-
formed debate, and through votes in 
both Chambers to express the will of 
the American people. 
Let me close by saying this to serv-
icemembers whom I meet in Delaware 
and to many more serving around the 
country and around the world: War 
should be our last resort. 
If diplomacy should fail in this case 
or others, I will insist our administra-
tion produce a clear strategy and a

mission for our troops that our service 
men and women can accomplish and 
that our Congress provide our military 
with the resources and authorities they 
need. 
We are blessed with a system of 
democratic governance that challenges 
us in times when stakes are highest to 
rise to the occasion and to earn our 
place in the history of this democratic 
Republic. We do that by reaffirming 
our faith in our Constitution, including 
article I, which gives to this body the 
responsibility to weigh vital decisions 
of war and peace. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, de-
bates between the executive branch 
and Congress over the power to con-
duct war is not a new topic, but in 
many ways, I think this debate has 
been blown out of proportion. A lot of 
this has to do with the decision made 
by President Trump, with the advice of 
his advisers, to eliminate one of the 
worst terrorists in the Middle East, 
Qasem Soleimani, who was plotting to 
burn down the American Embassy in 
Iraq and also threatened the lives of 
American troops—to take him off the 
battlefield. This is clearly within the 
President’s authority under the Con-
stitution. It really isn’t a matter of 
whether Congress needed to give him 
the authority to do that. 
I think we all agree that the Presi-
dent, as Commander in Chief, has to 
have his constitutional authority to 
defend American lives and American 
interests when Congress doesn’t have 
the time—and we don’t have the time— 
or is, frankly, not built for speed when 
it comes to addressing threats to na-
tional security like that. 
We do have a shared responsibility, 
but primarily the responsibility of the 
Congress can be exercised through our 
appropriations authority. We could lit-
erally cut off the funds that the execu-
tive branch would use to conduct oper-
ations if Congress sees fit. 
If this resolution succeeds, it will tie 
the Commander in Chief’s hands while 
the threat posed by Iran and terrorist 
organizations, like the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, and the 
Quds Force that was headed by General 
Soleimani, remains high. 
Actually, 
I 
think 
the 
President 
should be congratulated. Former gen-
eral David Petraeus said that what the 
President did by taking Soleimani off 
the battlefield reestablished some level 
of deterrence. In other words, if you 
are going to be stepping into the shoes 
of the head of the Quds Force and the 
IRGC to lead terrorist attacks against 
the United States and our allies, you 
are going to have to think twice before 
you do that because you might end up 
in the same condition that General 
Soleimani did. Reestablishing deter-
rence is very, very important because 
when our adversaries sense weakness, 
it is a provocation and an invitation to 
attack America and our allies and our 
interests. 
Again, I know some of our friends 
were upset that General Soleimani was 
taken out by a drone strike, but he was 
one of the most consequential military 
leaders in the Middle East and was di-
rectly responsible for the deaths of 
hundreds of American servicemembers, 
training Shia militias and others in the 
war in Iraq, providing them with im-
provised explosive devices. Actually, 
they are designed so they literally will 
melt through armor like a hot knife 
through butter. That all came from 
Iran and resulted in the deaths of hun-
dreds of American servicemembers. 
When a successful mission carried 
out by U.S. forces finally brought an 
end to Soleimani’s reign of terror, our 
colleagues couldn’t even acknowledge 
the President’s decisive action and 
that it undoubtedly saved lives. My 
mind immediately went back to, how 
did Republicans and Democrats act 
when President Obama directed the 
raid that took out Osama bin Laden? 
We didn’t draw partisan lines. We 
didn’t say: Well, he didn’t have the au-
thority to do that, so we are going to 
come back to Congress and tie his 
hands for the fight in the War on Ter-
ror. We didn’t do that. The reaction is 
like night and day between the oper-
ation directed at taking out Osama bin 
Laden and the operation that took out 
General Soleimani, the head of a ter-
rorist organization from a country that 
is a leading state sponsor of terrorism 
in the world. 
As I said, I strongly disagree with the 
claim that President Trump’s actions 
were outside his authority or that he 
should have come to Congress and 
sought congressional approval before 
acting. 
You may remember what Congress 
was doing while the President was hav-
ing to deal with this. The House was 
voting on Articles of Impeachment, 
and then the Senate had to conduct a 
trial of these Impeachment Articles. 
Obviously, it failed, but it took up 
time, where we literally could not have 
dealt with this emergency action and 
an opportunity to take a world-class 
terrorist off the battlefield. 
This was clearly not only within the 
President’s constitutional authority, 
but it was also his duty to prevent and 
stop threats against the United States, 
including those posed by the Iranian 
regime and their allies and the Shia 
militias. One of the other individuals 
who died in the attack directed at 
Soleimani was leader of the Shia mili-
tias in Iraq, had been plotting the de-
struction of the U.S. Embassy there 
and perhaps even a hostage situation, 
like we saw in 1979, but also plotting 
attacks against American servicemem-
bers there assisting the Iraqi people in 
trying to rebuild their government and 
provide them a means to govern them-
selves safely and to eliminate the ter-
rorist threat. 
Passing this resolution would limit 
the President’s authority to defend 
American servicemembers against im-
minent attacks and would place our 
troops further in harm’s way. So I will 
vote against the resolution, and I 
would implore our colleagues to do the 
same. 
I know that, in an era of Trump de-
rangement syndrome, anything that 
the President is for some people are re-
flexively against, and I think this falls 
in that category. Again, I don’t ques-
tion the motives of Members of Con-
gress in wanting to make sure that the 
shared powers that Congress and the 
President have under the Constitution 
to wage war—I don’t question their 
motives in trying to find the appro-
priate balance, but here I think we 
stepped across the line, literally, to try 
to tie the President’s hands as a pun-
ishment for conducting a fully author-
ized operation against one of the 
world’s worst terrorists, something we 
should applaud rather than condemn. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, over the last year we have wit-
nessed 
unprecedented 
foot-dragging, 
political gamesmanship, and downright 
obstruction by our Democratic col-
leagues in Congress on a number of 
bills. They have derailed the appropria-
tions process. They have knuckle- 
dragged during important trade nego-
tiations. They have held up things that 
used to have common support, non-
partisan 
support—things 
like 
the 
Debbie Smith Act. 
Of course, the Debbie Smith Act was 
designed to fund the testing of untest-
ed rape kits. This had been an area of 
broad bipartisan consensus that should 
be nonpartisan, but we saw the House 
of Representatives dragging their feet 
in order to gain leverage against the 
Senate for months, and they allowed 
the Debbie Smith Act to expire, along 
with potentially threatening the fund-
ing used to eliminate the rape kit 
backlog. 
The latest tactics have now been de-
ployed, if you thought that was about 
as low as things could get. The latest 
tactic is to weaponize the Violence 
Against Women Act. This is more than 
a 25-year program, and it is at the fore-
front of our commitment to support 
victims of domestic violence and sex-
ual assault. Until recently, it always 
had been high above the political fray. 
The first time this program came up 
for reauthorization, there were dis-
agreements over some aspects of the 
bill, but we were able to work together 
and reach a compromise. That is the 
only way anything gets done around 
here—bipartisan 
compromise. 
But 
when it came time to reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act last year, 
some in the House and some in the 
Senate saw an opportunity to score po-
litical points—not solve a problem, not 
reauthorize a program we all agree is 
important and necessary. They saw it 
as a political weapon. They allowed 
VAWA, or the Violence Against Women 
Act, to get caught in the crosshairs of 
a funding debate and insisted that we

S1024 
February 12, 2020 
should not fund that vital program be-
cause it was overdue for updates. 
Well, let me be clear. Both sides 
agree there are things we could do to 
improve the Violence Against Women 
Act, and that is what our colleague 
from Iowa, Senator ERNST, has been 
leading on our side. But this ‘‘my way 
or the highway’’ legislative strategy 
isn’t the approach that is designed to 
get anything done, and vital funding 
for victims of domestic violence and 
sexual assault should never, ever be 
used as leverage to gain political ad-
vantage. 
Though our colleagues allowed the 
authorization of the Violence Against 
Women Act to expire, thankfully, saner 
heads prevailed. It did receive record 
funding levels last year, but that 
doesn’t mean we are in the clear. We 
need to figure out a long-term solution 
that will reauthorize this important 
program. As the Presiding Officer 
knows—as we all know—there has to be 
an authorization bill and then funding 
to meet the terms of that authoriza-
tion. We need both. 
Last fall, we thought we were mak-
ing good progress. As I said, Senator 
ERNST spent months working with the 
bipartisan group of Senators, including 
Senator FEINSTEIN, the senior Senator 
from California, trying to work on a 
compromise. Before these negotiations 
could be completed, Democrats got up 
and left the negotiating table and 
headed straight for the TV cameras 
and 
held 
a 
press conference con-
demning Republicans for not falling 
into line on their partisan bill. 
Well, what was the big news at the 
press conference? Not that a deal had 
been reached or that negotiations were 
making progress. The Democratic lead-
ership marched up to the microphone 
and said they would be introducing a 
near replica of the House’s partisan 
bill, which doesn’t have the support 
needed to pass it in the Senate. During 
the press conference, one of our col-
leagues, the Senator from Hawaii, even 
conceded five times that the bill was 
going nowhere, proving that our Demo-
cratic colleagues had no intention of 
introducing a bill that could become 
law. 
If this sounds familiar, if you have 
seen this movie before, well, that is be-
cause we went through the same exer-
cise back in 2012 and 2013. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues used this issue to at-
tack Republicans up for reelection for 
not supporting their partisan bill at 
that time, after they chose not to ne-
gotiate in good faith for a bipartisan 
bill. 
So I think that is what is happening 
again. They are not interested in reau-
thorizing the Violence Against Women 
Act. If they were actually interested in 
solving a problem, we would solve the 
problem and get it passed, but they 
would rather have the issue that they 
can use in their campaigns for Novem-
ber and show contempt, frankly, for 
the people who would benefit from 
passing the Violence Against Women 
Act and turn this into purely a par-
tisan issue. 
I believe that our colleague from 
California, Senator FEINSTEIN, wants 
to get a bipartisan bill done. I have 
worked with her a number of times on 
a number of pieces of legislation. She 
is a good partner to work with on the 
other side of the aisle. I know her com-
mitment to continue negotiating with 
Senator ERNST is genuine, but, frankly, 
I don’t think she is pulling the strings 
on the Democratic side. 
I think our colleague, the Demo-
cratic leader, is the one preventing ne-
gotiations here, because his main goal, 
as we have seen through the impeach-
ment circus and elsewhere, is to be-
come the next majority leader, and he 
thinks this is the best weapon the 
Democrats can use to beat Republicans 
running for the Senate in 2020. 
How shameful is that? How degrading 
and disrespectful is that to the people 
who would benefit from the passage of 
a 
consensus, 
bipartisan 
Violence 
Against Women Act? 
I can only hope that cooler heads will 
prevail and that our colleagues across 
the aisle—but, principally, the Demo-
cratic 
leader—will 
just 
quit 
weaponizing this dispute over VAWA 
and return to the negotiating table. 
Until then, we will keep working on a 
bill that could win the support of folks 
on both sides. 
Senator ERNST produced such a bill, 
an alternative to the bill produced by 
the Senate Democrats, and I am proud 
to cosponsor that legislation. Overall, 
this bill sends more funding and re-
sources to the victims of sexual assault 
and sexual abuse than does the Demo-
crat bill, and it authorizes the program 
for twice as long. That is critical to 
protecting 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act from the kind of partisan 
games that we are seeing played out 
today, and it gives the Department of 
Justice the stability it needs to plan 
for the future, because it is the Depart-
ment of Justice that hands out the 
grants to the various organizations 
that provide aid and comfort to victims 
of sexual assault. 
While this increased funding would 
be a welcomed victory for the program, 
it is only part of what sets this bill 
apart. It goes further than other reau-
thorizations by addressing a number of 
horrific crimes that are being com-
mitted against women and girls in our 
country. Sex trafficking, for example, 
is not always recognized as a form of 
sexual assault, and this bill would 
change that. 
It also enhances the maximum crimi-
nal penalties for sexual abuse of minors 
and other vulnerable groups. It takes 
aim at heinous crimes like mutilation 
and addresses crimes in rural areas and 
on Tribal lands. 
This bill also takes aim at relatively 
new threats, like when abusive images 
and videos are posted online. It will 
empower victims of this kind of abuse 
to remove the content from the inter-
net by using copyright takedown au-
thority. 
Unlike the Democratic bill, this leg-
islation includes provisions of a num-
ber of bipartisan bills that have been 
introduced by our colleagues in the 
Senate. One example is a bill I intro-
duced with Senator FEINSTEIN called 
the HEALS Act, which would remove 
some of the hurdles that exist between 
victims of domestic violence and safe 
housing. One of the toughest things for 
a victim of sexual violence and sexual 
assault is finding a safe place to live. 
This provision that Senator FEINSTEIN 
and I have included in Senator ERNST’s 
version of the Violence Against Women 
Act reauthorization includes greater 
flexibility for transitional housing so 
survivors can get back on their feet 
without fear of losing the roof over 
their head or exposing themselves to 
their attacker. 
The Violence Against Women Act is a 
lifeline for countless survivors of do-
mestic violence and sexual assault, and 
we need to come together to reauthor-
ize this critical program. The bill in-
troduced by Senator ERNST includes a 
range 
of 
bipartisan 
proposals 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act without the poison pills 
being 
offered 
by 
the 
Democrats’ 
version. I can only hope that our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
will return to the negotiating table and 
work with us to finally reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act. This is 
simply too important to use as a par-
tisan bludgeon during the runup to the 
2020 election. 
We need to address the problem. We 
need to solve the problem applying the 
80–20 rule. If you can agree to 80 per-
cent of it, let’s get it done, and we can 
save the 20 percent we don’t agree on 
for another day and another fight, and 
not hold victims of sexual violence at 
risk, as the status quo currently does. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I hadn’t planned to say anything 
about the Violence Against Women 
Act, but given the remarks from my 
colleague from Texas, let me just say 
that the bill that passed the House last 
year is here in the Senate. While it is 
true that it did not have a majority of 
Republican House Members supporting 
it, it did have Republican votes in the 
House. It expands protections under 
the Violence Against Women Act, and, 
like many bills that passed the House, 
it had very broad support. 
It is sitting right here in the Senate, 
along with legislation that requires 
universal background checks to reduce 
gun violence, along with legislation to 
get secret money out of politics and 
make sure we refresh our democracy 
and reduce barriers to voting, along 
with many other bills, including a 
long-overdue increase in the Federal 
minimum wage. 
I would suggest that the best way to 
find out whether or not it, in fact, has 
majority support here in the Senate is 
to let us vote on it, and anyone who

S.J. RES. 68 
Madam President, I am here today 
specifically to talk in support of the 
joint resolution offered by Senator 
KAINE
of Virginia that directs the 
President to remove U.S. Armed Forces 
from hostilities against Iran without 
an authorization from the Congress. 
The Framers gave Congress, and Con-
gress only, the power to declare war. 
As James Madison noted, ‘‘the history 
of all governments demonstrates that 
the executive is the branch of [govern-
ment] most interested in war and 
[therefore] most prone to it.’’ The Con-
stitution ‘‘has accordingly with studied 
care, vested the question of war in the 
legislature’’—meaning in the Senate 
and in the House of Representatives. 
The Framers did that because they 
didn’t want one person—and one person 
alone—to be able to make such a mo-
mentous decision for the entire coun-
try. 
They wanted to have a clear check on 
the President’s ability to send our sons 
and daughters into harm’s way. 
The text of the Constitution cannot 
be more clear. Article I, section 8 
states: ‘‘The Congress’’—not the Presi-
dent—‘‘shall have Power . . . To de-
clare War.’’ 
The resolution before us is equally 
clear. It reaffirms Congress’s power and 
‘‘directs the President to terminate the 
use of United States Armed Forces for 
hostilities against the Islamic Republic 
of Iran or any part of its government 
or military, unless explicitly author-
ized by a declaration of war or specific 
authorization for the use of military 
force against Iran.’’ 
That is what the resolution says. I 
hope my Senate colleagues see this res-
olution for what it is: a clear and im-
portant reminder to the executive 
branch of the power granted to Con-
gress by the Constitution. The much 
tougher votes would come on questions 
of whether to authorize military action 
in Iran or any other circumstances. 
This resolution is a simple reaffirma-
tion of our solemn duty to make these 
decisions. 
Whether or not we agree with Presi-
dent Trump’s approach to Iran or the 
decision to strike Iranian General 
Qasem Soleimani, we should all agree 
that any decision to go to war should 
be made by Congress, not by the Presi-
dent alone. 
The President’s ability to protect the 
United States and our forces from an 
imminent threat—or any other power 
granted to the President as Com-
mander in Chief—cannot, and should 
not, be a blank check, not for this 
President, not for any other President. 
Why are we here at this moment, dis-
cussing this important issue? Because 
just a short time ago, we almost stum-
bled into a war with Iran. And make no 
mistake, the tensions may not be play-
ing out on our TV screens today, and 
they may not be making headlines at 
this particular moment, but it is still a 
very dangerous and volatile time. The 
pot is still boiling, and unless cooler 
heads prevail, it could boil over at any 
moment. We cannot allow that to hap-
pen. We must not fall into another un-
necessary war in the Middle East. Cer-
tainly, no one should take the United 
States to war without a full debate in 
the U.S. Congress and a vote in the 
U.S. Congress. 
How did we get here? The Trump ad-
ministration came into office with one 
organizing principle to undo every-
thing the Obama administration did: 
Undo the Affordable Care Act; get rid 
of the Paris climate agreement; and, of 
course, get rid of the agreement to pre-
vent Iran from obtaining a nuclear 
weapon. 
Reversing the policies of a previous 
President is a campaign slogan; it is 
not a strategy for the national security 
of the United States. In the case of 
Iran, the Trump administration put 
nothing realistic in its place. 
The fundamental idea behind the nu-
clear agreement with Iran was simple 
and realistic. It recognized that Iran is 
a malign influence in the region. But it 
also recognized that a nuclear-armed 
Iran engaged in malign activities in 
the region is even worse. If our strat-
egy could contain the Soviet Union, we 
could also apply a similar strategy to 
Iran. 
The agreement to prevent Iran from 
obtaining a nuclear weapon, known as 
the JCPOA, came from a deliberate 
strategy and painstaking negotiations 
to unite key powers—powers that are 
often in disagreement—allies, competi-
tors, and adversaries, including Brit-
ain, France, Germany, the European 
Union, China, and Russia. 
Together, we created and enforced a 
truly global sanctions regime to bring 
Iran to the negotiating table to reach 
an agreement. It was that unity and 
pressure that succeeded in reaching the 
agreement to prevent Iran from obtain-
ing nuclear weapons. 
It was working. Under the agree-
ment, Iran committed to dismantling 
large sections of its nuclear infrastruc-
ture, to severely limit its production of 
uranium and plutonium, and it agreed 
to an intrusive, around-the-clock inter-
national inspections. It was compliant 
with its obligations under the nuclear 
agreement, and we were succeeding in 
pushing back Iran’s so-called breakout 
time—the time it would need to build a 
nuclear weapon. Even this administra-
tion agreed with the international 
community that Iran was complying 
with the agreement. There was no need 
to beat the drums of war. 
Then comes the Trump administra-
tion, with many of the same people 
who got us into the unnecessary war in 
Iraq, and they took a different path. 
Instead of working to build on the 
agreement to prevent Iran from obtain-
ing a nuclear weapon, they tore it up. 
They alienated our allies who, even to 
this day, are still working to salvage 
that agreement. 
Instead of building on the progress 
we 
had 
made, 
President 
Trump 
launched a campaign of what he called 
maximum pressure, which has resulted 
only in total failure. 
Secretary Pompeo made 12 demands 
of Iran as part of the maximum pres-
sure strategy, and the administration 
has not achieved any of them—not a 
single one. Instead, faced with in-
creased economic pressure, Iran pre-
dictably lashed out. Instead of dialing 
down its malign activities in the re-
gion, it has intensified. Tensions have 
increased. 
Without any endgame or any sign 
that this administration will negotiate 
in good faith—any sign of that—Iran 
has no incentive to change course. 
It is long past time that we have a 
strategy that recognizes simple polit-
ical geography. We must recognize Iran 
has a strong hand in Iraq. They are 
neighbors. They share a long border. 
They are both majority Shiite coun-
tries. Nothing we can do here will 
change those facts. 
Instead of recognizing realities on 
the ground and smartly countering 
Iran’s natural advantages in the re-
gion, this administration’s policies ac-
tually strengthened Iran’s hands. In 
short, it has taken a bad situation and 
made it much worse. In this very com-
bustible mix, a single spark can ignite 
a war. That almost happened just a 
very short time ago. We were on the 
brink. 
We learned recently that the original 
action that set off the sequence of esca-
lation may have been based on a mis-
take. A rocket fell into an Iraqi mili-
tary compound where we had U.S. 
Forces providing some training and 
took the life of an American contractor 
in Iraq. The Trump administration 
claimed that the rocket was fired by an 
Iraqi militia force backed by Iran. Just 
very recently, Iraq—our ally Iraq—says 
that the rocket may have been fired 
not by Iranian-backed militia but by 
ISIS. We don’t know because the ad-
ministration hasn’t shared any of that 
intelligence with us. 
Acting on what may have been a 
false assessment from the start, we 
then saw a series of escalatory acts. 
Then, when things appeared to be cool-
ing down, the President ordered the 
strike against Iran’s top military lead-
er while he was visiting Iraq. 
I think all of us know that no one in 
this Chamber is grieving the death of 
General Soleimani. He has lots of blood 
on his hands. Make no mistake, killing 
him has not weakened Iran’s hand in 
Iraq in the long term; it has strength-
ened it. There have been growing calls 
in Iraq to expel U.S. Forces, including 
a vote by Iraq’s Parliament, and in-
creasing pressure to throw all U.S. 
Forces out. 
What was Soleimani’s main objective 
in Iraq? What is Iran’s main objective 
in Iraq? To get rid of U.S. Forces there. 
So, in death, Soleimani has gotten 
closer to his goal of throwing out U.S. 
Forces than he did in life. That is not

a strategic success for the United 
States by any definition. 
The administration justified its at-
tack against Soleimani on the grounds 
that he posed an ‘‘imminent threat.’’ 
At least that is what they said at the 
beginning. Since then, we have heard a 
lot of other rationales. They used that 
particular expression because it has a 
very specific meaning under inter-
national law, and it was the only le-
gally justifiable rationale for ordering 
the execution of Soleimani. 
The problem they have is that it just 
isn’t true. Soleimani was a very bad 
guy. He had blood on his hands. But it 
is not true that he posed an imminent 
threat under the definition that is ap-
plied in the use of force. 
We know this because while the 
Trump administration took a very long 
time to do it, when they finally pro-
vided the Senate with the classified 
briefing on the situation, it was clear 
the evidence did not support the claim 
of an imminent threat. In fact, the in-
formation proved the opposite was 
true. 
We have been here before. We have 
seen what happens when administra-
tions 
manipulate 
intelligence 
or 
mischaracterize intelligence, which is 
closer to the case we are looking at 
now—mischaracterizing intelligence in 
order to justify a particular course of 
action. 
In the case of Iraq, President Bush, 
Vice President Cheney, and many other 
members of that administration were 
determined to go to war to ‘‘remake’’ 
the Middle East. They searched for pre-
texts. They embraced a source called 
Curveball. They cherry-picked the in-
telligence to justify their predeter-
mined plan. 
We know the end of the story. We 
know the end of that story. Their 
claims that Iraq possessed weapons of 
mass destruction were fake, but the 
toll of the Iraq war was very real. 
The cost in blood and treasure were 
nearly 4,900 American lives lost, and 
counting; tens of thousands wounded, 
and counting; $2 trillion spent, and 
counting. The amount we will spend 
caring for those who bore the battle, 
and their families, will not be fully 
known for decades, if ever. The death 
toll of Iraqi civilians is not precisely 
known but is certainly horrific. 
The biggest winner from the war in 
Iraq was Iran—Iran—that had fought in 
an almost 9-year war against Iraq and 
was able to take advantage of a weak-
ened Iraq. It just goes to show the 
many unintended consequences of ac-
tion not thoroughly thought through. 
Before we get into another war in the 
Middle East, whether by design or by 
miscalculation, 
let’s 
come 
to 
our 
senses. A war with Iran would do incal-
culable harm to the United States and 
to people throughout the Middle East. 
It will result in huge loss of American 
lives and the lives of thousands of 
other innocent people. 
That is why our Founders did not put 
the power to take our country to war 
in the hands of one person. They did 
not empower the President to take our 
Nation to war. President Trump has 
said that article II gives him ‘‘the right 
to do whatever I want as President.’’ 
We know that is not true. We know 
that is not what the Constitution says. 
We know that the Framers vested the 
power to go to war in this Senate and 
the House of Representatives, and they 
did it for a reason. 
For goodness sake, let us not betray 
our constitutional duty. Let us, at the 
very least, have the courage to assert 
the powers the Constitution entrusts in 
us. 
I yield back the time. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today 
to 
support 
my 
colleague, 
Senator 
KAINE, in support of this resolution be-
fore us, a resolution that would pro-
hibit the United States from con-
ducting 
offensive 
military 
strikes 
against Iran unless or until some time 
as Congress may authorize it. 
This is how security policy in our 
constitutional Republic is supposed to 
work. It is how decisions like these are 
supposed to be made. Congress author-
izes the use of military force and the 
President—as Commander in Chief—di-
rects the military as it undertakes the 
effort to complete its missions. 
This arrangement gives the Amer-
ican people the best of both worlds—a 
deliberative, representative legislature 
to declare war and a single, decisive 
Commander in Chief to lead the troops. 
Unfortunately, 
Congress 
has 
not 
upheld its end of this responsibility. 
Our system of checks and balances— 
while very beneficial to the American 
people and while giving us the greatest 
opportunity to protect our freedom, 
our liberty, and our system of govern-
ment—imposes a degree of rigor and 
accountability on Congress, which its 
Members, 
unfortunately, 
sometimes 
are inclined to shirk whenever possible. 
This trend has sadly gained momentum 
for decades, and it has done so under 
Presidents, House of Representatives, 
and Senates of every conceivable par-
tisan combination. Now, nearly two 
decades into multiple wars without 
clear missions or paths to victory, it is 
time for Congress to reassert, on behalf 
of our constituents, our vital constitu-
tional role in American warmaking. 
Before addressing the merits of this 
particular resolution, let me first dis-
pel two very mistaken assumptions 
being made about it. 
First, it is not about defying Presi-
dent Trump. Quite to the contrary, 
this 
resolution 
supports 
President 
Trump and his particularly deferential 
approach—one that defers to the Amer-
ican people, one that accepts, at the 
outset, the fact that we can’t fight 
wars all around the globe in per-
petuity, and we certainly can’t and 
shouldn’t do that without the consent 
of the American people and that of 
their elected representatives in Con-
gress. Indeed, on this issue, President 
Trump is the most restrained and the 
most Constitution-minded Commander 
in Chief we have had in decades. I be-
lieve he is the most restrained and 
Constitution-minded 
Commander 
in 
Chief we have had in my entire life-
time. He is exactly the kind of partner 
Congress needs in order to get the Con-
stitution’s warmaking process back on 
the rails—back on the same rails that 
were designed in 1787. 
Second, this resolution is not about 
condemning the strike against General 
Soleimani last month. After all, the 
strike against Soleimani worked. He 
was an enemy of the United States, 
with the blood of hundreds of Ameri-
cans and thousands of Iraqis, Syrians, 
and even other Iranians on his hands. 
Everything we know about him and his 
work of terror confirms that he was 
planning to kill again and to do so 
soon. 
Rather, what this resolution is about 
is Congress reclaiming its rightful pow-
ers to restore accountability and con-
sensus to this most grave of all public 
policy decisions that we, as Members of 
Congress, are asked to make. 
I understand why Members of Con-
gress are OK with pretending to be 
pundits on matters of national secu-
rity, cheering the troops when things 
go well and attacking the President 
when they don’t, but we are not just 
political pundits on cable news shows. 
We have a job to do based on an oath 
that we took right here in this Cham-
ber to uphold and ‘‘protect and defend 
the Constitution of the United States.’’ 
In order to enable the President of 
the United States to do his job cor-
rectly, we have to be willing to do ours. 
You see, this is part of the evil design 
of the military industrial complex to 
convince Members of Congress, first 
and foremost, that they don’t have to 
and shouldn’t want to put their name 
on the line when it comes to war 
power. This unfairly puts the blame 
and the accountability all on the Presi-
dent of the United States. That is 
wrong. 
Just as importantly, it disconnects 
the American people from their elected 
representatives here in the Senate and 
in the House of Representatives from a 
process that really could put not just 
American treasure but also American 
blood—the blood of their own sons and 
daughters—on the line. That is not 
right. 
The Founders could not have been 
any clearer about this. That is espe-
cially true when it comes to the great-
est Founder of them all. Remember 
when the Miami and Wabash Indians 
attacked Americans north of the Ohio 
River between 1791 and 1794, President 
George Washington carefully confined 
his military operations to exclusively 
defensive measures. ‘‘The Constitu-
tion,’’ Washington wrote, ‘‘vests the 
power of declaring War with Congress, 
therefore no offensive expedition of im-
portance can be undertaken until after 
they shall have deliberated upon the 
subject, and authorized such a meas-
ure.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1027 
February 12, 2020 
Our first President, George Wash-
ington, was a humble man, and he was 
a modest man. One of my favorite 
paintings in this entire building can be 
found in the Capitol Rotunda, where 
you see George Washington handing his 
commission back to the Continental 
Congress. This at the moment when he 
had ascended the apex of power; this at 
the moment when he was the most re-
spected, well-known person, certainly, 
in the Western Hemisphere, possibly in 
the entire world; this at a moment 
when, in any other land and any other 
point in world history, George Wash-
ington was in a position to become a 
Monarch, a King, he chose not to be. 
He said right then and right there: not 
on this soil; not on my watch. I am 
handing my commission back to the 
Republican institution that employed 
me to begin with. 
So, yes, he was a humble man, and he 
was a modest man, but this wasn’t just 
an act of humility or modesty; it was 
duty. He understood that he had taken 
an oath to uphold, protect, and defend 
the Constitution of the United States. 
As President, he would not deviate 
from it because he had taken an oath 
that he wouldn’t. 
Under the Constitution—whose draft-
ing President Washington oversaw be-
fore he was President of the United 
States, while he was President of the 
Constitutional 
Convention 
and 
to 
which he swore an oath of office later— 
the power to direct war would reside in 
him as President of the United States 
as Commander in Chief, but the power 
to declare war resided exclusively with 
Congress. 
This was, of course, very different 
than the form of government that we 
had left just a few years prior to that. 
Under our previous system of govern-
ment, the one based in London, the 
Parliament had no role in declaring 
war. Declaring war was up to the Exec-
utive, the Monarch, the King. The King 
could—and in many instances would 
and did—take the country to war. It 
was the job of the legislative branch of 
government, of the Parliament, to fig-
ure out what to do about it, how to 
fund it, and where to go from there, 
but it was up to the King and the King 
alone to take us to war. 
This, Alexander Hamilton explained 
in Federalist 69, was exactly the kind 
of system we didn’t want. It would be 
up to Congress in the first instance to 
declare war. Congress and Congress 
alone would have this power. Why? 
Well, because it is the branch of gov-
ernment most accountable to the peo-
ple with the most regular intervals. 
When the American people are called 
upon to put their own blood and treas-
ure—their own sons and daughters on 
the line in the name of safety, security, 
freedom—nothing else can suffice but a 
vote in Congress. George Washington 
understood that. 
Donald 
Trump 
understands 
that 
today, and to his great credit, Presi-
dent Trump has followed this standard. 
He has countered recent Iranian ag-
gression through economic sanctions. 
They are working, and it appears that 
Iran is standing down. Tehran has al-
ready had to cut back support for 
international terrorist organizations 
and its nuclear program, and its oil ex-
ports are plummeting. Iran’s economy 
has been crippled, contracting by al-
most 10 percent. The Iranian people 
know it is the fault of their own gov-
ernment, their own government offi-
cials. Tens of thousands of Iranian pro-
testers have taken to the streets to 
protest their own government, even 
knowing that such action may lead 
them to injury or imprisonment or 
even death. 
Even the New York Times has admit-
ted that the Iranian regime is losing 
the will to confront the United States. 
There may be a pathway to peace and 
prosperity 
for 
the 
Iranian 
people 
through sanctions relief and trade if 
the Iranian Government is willing to 
cease its support for radical Islamic 
militant organizations and abandon its 
pursuit of nuclear weapons and ICBMs. 
Until then, the United States, under 
President 
Trump’s 
leadership, 
will 
maintain maximum pressure through 
sanctions and defend the United States 
from any further attacks. 
I 
stand 
firmly 
behind 
President 
Trump in this course of action, and 
like President Trump, I believe that we 
ought to avoid war if we can. After 
nearly two decades of military entan-
glement in Iraq and Afghanistan— 
much of which was fostered by Depart-
ment of Defense bureaucrats deceiving 
Congress and misleading the American 
people, as we have recently tragically 
learned—the last thing we need is an-
other aimless, protracted conflict in 
the Middle East. The other last thing 
we need is to have such a conflict occur 
without Congress even authorizing it. 
In any event, war with Iran is cur-
rently neither warranted nor con-
sistent with our strategic interests. To 
be very clear, under this resolution, 
the President would retain all of his 
authority as Commander in Chief to 
take defensive measures against active 
threats to U.S. persons, assets, and the 
homeland, including our Armed Forces 
abroad and our diplomats in U.S. Em-
bassies, even without a declaration of 
war or authorization for the use of 
military force. Such power inheres and 
resides in article II. He already has 
that power. Nothing in this resolution 
can or would or even attempts to un-
dermine or erode that power. 
However, even when defensive meas-
ures are conducted, the administration 
should share the justifying evidence 
with Congress. This, you see, is how 
this inherent tension between, on the 
one hand, the congressional war dec-
laration of power in article I and, on 
the other hand, the article II power 
that the President has as Commander 
in Chief. This is how they are held in 
balance. It is for that information- 
sharing process to be ongoing. 
As a separate branch of govern-
ment—the branch with the constitu-
tional prerogative over the power to 
declare war—we are not required to 
simply 
accept 
an 
administration’s 
talking points as a matter of faith, es-
pecially after almost two decades of de-
ception in Afghanistan. Intelligence- 
sharing ensures that Congress can ap-
propriately 
determine 
whether 
it 
should or should not provide the ad-
ministration with further authority to 
conduct offensive military force. 
The intelligence so far shared with 
Congress 
on 
recent 
actions 
taken 
against Iran has fallen short, but my 
main concern with the briefing that I 
called the ‘‘worst’’ that I had ever wit-
nessed on military matters in my more 
than 9 years in the Senate was that we 
were given no indication, whatsoever, 
that any ongoing offensive action 
against Iran would occur with con-
sultation and authorization from Con-
gress. This was inexcusable. 
This was, moreover, not the Presi-
dent’s approach. It was not something 
that would have occurred in the Presi-
dent’s presence. It certainly is not 
something that would have been com-
municated by the President, himself, 
because this is not how Donald Trump 
operates. That briefing was not the 
President’s fault. That briefing was the 
fault of individuals who decided to go 
off on a detour of their own, forgetting 
whom they represent. Worst of all, in 
that briefing, it was suggested that en-
gaging in public debate, discussion, and 
deliberation about further military ac-
tion in Iran—in other words, precisely 
what we are doing right here and right 
now—would somehow empower our en-
emies and undermine the morale of our 
men and women overseas. This is as 
false as it is insulting to the American 
people and demeaning to the constitu-
tional framework to which each of us 
has sworn an oath. It is contrary to our 
very form of government. 
Constitutionally separated powers, 
exercised with accountability to the 
people via checks and balances, are 
precisely 
what 
makes 
the 
United 
States strong. Bowing to the politi-
cians’ impulse to avoid responsibility 
and subvert our constitutional duty— 
that is what empowers our enemies and 
undermines the morale of our Nation. 
Whether the United States sends our 
young men and women into harm’s 
way, yet again, is on us—not to cheer 
or jeer but, rather, to decide and stand 
accountable for. So, of course, that de-
cision ought to be made at the end of a 
very public debate that requires not 
only our attention but our contribu-
tions and, ultimately, our assent. Our 
names have to be on the line if we are 
going to offer up our fellow beings to 
stand in harm’s way. 
For too long, Congress has delib-
erately and in a very cowardly manner 
shrunk from its constitutional respon-
sibility for its own narrow, selfish, 
shallow, political interests. Yet, by 
taking itself out of the process of de-
bating and declaring war, Congress has 
taken the American people out of the 
process, and that is simply unaccept-
able.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1028 
February 12, 2020 
It is time to turn the page. 
Osama bin Laden is dead, and so are 
the 9/11 terrorists. General Soleimani is 
dead, and Iran is weakened and iso-
lated. Saddam Hussein is dead and has 
been out of power for a generation, and 
Iraq is a sovereign nation that can and 
should dictate its own course. We now 
face new challenges. Our priorities 
have rightfully changed, and they 
must. 
While this resolution speaks only to 
offensive action against Iran, I believe 
it is time to repeal the 2002 AUMF and 
bring our troops in Iraq home. It is also 
time to repeal the 2001 AUMF and 
bring our troops in Afghanistan home. 
That is a question that we can and 
should address in this body. 
In the meantime, we as a body and as 
a nation should at least agree that 
there is no justification for further 
military action in Iran in the absence 
of a new authorization for use of mili-
tary force or a declaration of war by 
Congress. 
This resolution is consistent with the 
President’s desire to keep us out of ex-
cessive, unnecessary, and especially 
undeclared, unconstitutional wars. It is 
consistent with the vision of our 
Founding Fathers, who sought to make 
it harder to enter into war by the re-
quiring of express consent from a bi-
cameral legislature, and it is con-
sistent with the conviction that the 
American 
people, 
whose 
sons 
and 
daughters lay down their lives to de-
fend us, should get a say in this mat-
ter. 
President Trump wants to make 
America great again. I stand with him. 
The military-industrial complex wants 
to make America Great Britain again, 
and I stand strongly against the mili-
tary-industrial complex. Making Amer-
ica Great Britain again would include 
such things as giving the executive the 
power 
and 
keeping 
the 
legislative 
branch out of the power of declaring 
war. That is wrong. That is not what 
our Constitution allows. It is not even 
what President Trump wants. We need 
to support this resolution. 
COMMEMORATING UTAH WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE 
Mr. President, on February 14, 1870, a 
remarkable thing happened in Utah— 
something that changed the course of 
history not just in our State but in our 
entire Nation. 
Seraph Young, a 23-year-old school-
teacher, became the first American 
woman to cast a vote in a political 
election under an equal suffrage law. It 
was a moment that both followed and 
preceded a long line of remarkable con-
tributions from Utah women—women 
who have pioneered and led in our 
State and in our Nation. 
Take Mary Fielding Smith, the wife 
of Hyrum Smith, who was one of the 
early leaders of The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. After 
Hyrum was murdered, the resilient 
widow followed in Brigham Young’s 
footsteps. She took her children and 
led a group of pioneers across 1,300 
miles of wilderness into the West. 
Through a combination of faith and 
grit, she braved treacherous weather, a 
massive buffalo stampede, and a myr-
iad of hazards and successfully led the 
entourage to a settlement where they 
could build a new life and live in free-
dom. 
Other Utah women continued to 
blaze trails, and Martha Hughes Can-
non stands out among them. At a time 
when women rarely went to college, 
Martha aspired to be a medical doctor. 
She earned a degree in both medicine 
and pharmaceuticals. A skilled public 
speaker, she also earned degrees in ora-
tory and public speaking, which gave 
her four degrees by the time she was 25 
years old. In the late 19th century, she 
quickly became a leader in Utah’s bur-
geoning women’s suffrage movement, 
and she put her speaking skills to good 
use. 
At a large suffrage meeting in 1889, 
held at Temple Square, she argued: 
No privileged class either of sex, wealth, or 
descent should be allowed to rise or exist. All 
persons should have the [same] legal right to 
be the equal of every other. 
In the first year that women could 
vote and run in a Utah election, Mar-
tha ran as a Democrat for one of the 
five State Senate seats. She even ran 
against her own husband. She became 
the first woman to be elected as a 
State senator either in Utah or in any 
other jurisdiction in the United States, 
and she went on to sponsor many suc-
cessful and influential legislative pro-
posals. All the while she was in public 
office, she continued to run her private 
medical practice and raise her three 
children. 
It is, indeed, fitting that we will soon 
be installing a statue of this extraor-
dinary woman here in the U.S. Capitol 
Building. 
Fast-forward to today, when Utah 
women are continuing to carry the 
banner of public leadership and service. 
We have Ruth Watkins as president 
of the University of Utah; Astrid 
Tuminez as president of Utah Valley 
University; Noelle E. Cockett as presi-
dent of Utah State University; Deneece 
Huftalin as president of Salt Lake 
Community College; and Beth Dobkin 
as president of Westminster College. 
We have Gail Miller, philanthropist 
and entrepreneur, who took over the 
ownership of the Utah Jazz after Larry, 
her late husband, died. She took over 
his other companies as well. She has 
led the team and companies with ex-
ceptional grace, dedication, and suc-
cess and has helped their philanthropic 
arm champion education, homeless-
ness, and family causes. We also have 
Carine Clark, president and CEO of 
Banyan, who is forging paths in Silicon 
Slopes and Utah’s tech community. 
In all different capacities and in all 
different fields, Utah women are con-
tinuing to make invaluable contribu-
tions in our State and in our Nation. 
These women have offered and con-
tinue to offer much needed gifts to 
their families, communities, schools, 
churches, businesses, and governments. 
When Martha Hughes Cannon spoke 
before a U.S. Senate committee about 
the success of women’s suffrage in 
Utah, she said: ‘‘The story of the strug-
gle for Woman’s suffrage in Utah is the 
story of all efforts for the advancement 
and betterment of humanity.’’ 
As we approach the 150th anniversary 
of Seraph Young’s groundbreaking vote 
and as we enter the centennial year of 
the 19th Amendment, it is only fitting 
that we honor the legacy of these re-
markable women and all they have 
given to my State and to our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take 
this time to urge my colleagues to sup-
port S.J. Res. 68, which, as I under-
stand, we will be voting on tomorrow. 
It is a resolution that was introduced 
by Senator KAINE. I acknowledge Sen-
ator KAINE’s longstanding commitment 
to the U.S. Senate’s and Congress’s 
carrying out our constitutional respon-
sibilities as they relate to the author-
ization for use of military force, which 
rests solely with the Congress of the 
United States, and we have a responsi-
bility to speak as to that authority. 
In the last Congress, with Senator 
Flake, there were efforts in the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations to try 
to bring us together in regard to the 
passage of an AUMF, the authorization 
for use of military force, because we 
had seen successive administrations 
using our military without their hav-
ing authorization from Congress. 
S.J. Res. 68 is aimed at one specific 
conflict for which we can come to-
gether, and I am optimistic that we 
will be able to act on this resolution. It 
deals with the use of force in Iran. It is 
very specific as to say that, unless ex-
plicitly authorized by a declaration of 
war or a specific authorization for use 
of military force against Iran, there is 
no authority to use our military 
against Iran. 
Now, certainly, for legitimate rea-
sons, the President can use force to de-
fend us from an imminent attack. That 
is, certainly, how I think all of us per-
ceive the authorization for use of mili-
tary force from Congress needs to be 
qualified. In the case of an urgent situ-
ation, the President can, in fact, act. 
Why do we need this resolution 
passed now? 
I need not tell my colleagues that 
there is a heightened sense of tension 
between the United States and Iran. It 
has been building for some time—cer-
tainly, with the U.S. military action in 
which General Soleimani was killed. 
He was the leader of the Quds Force in 
Iran, and he was taken out by our U.S. 
military. That has presented a height-
ened tension between the United States 
and Iran. 
Congress has the sole responsibility 
to commit our troops to combat. It is 
in article I, section 8 of the Constitu-
tion that Congress has the power to de-
clare war. This is not a decision made

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1029 
February 12, 2020 
by the President; it is a decision made 
by Congress. Our Founders were very 
concerned about having the appro-
priate balance between the executive 
branch and the legislative branch. It is 
called checks and balances. We did not 
want a monarchy. We wanted to make 
sure that there was sufficient support 
before war was declared; that it was in 
our national security interest; that the 
Congress and the President and the 
American people were all together in 
the effort if we were going to initiate 
war against another country; that the 
use of the military should always be a 
matter of last resort; and that we 
should always exhaust diplomacy—that 
we should always exhaust other means 
before America initiates war against 
another country or the use of military 
force. 
This authority that rests in Congress 
was tested in the Vietnam war. The 
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed 
by Congress at the early stages during 
the Vietnam conflict to give the Presi-
dent the authority to use force to de-
fend our military against attacks com-
ing from Vietnam. It was never in-
tended to lead us into an act of pro-
longed war, but, as we know, it was 
used by successive administrations for 
maintaining a prolonged war in Viet-
nam. I think historians would agree 
that this was an abuse of the interpre-
tation of authorization and that the 
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was never 
intended for offensive military oper-
ations in Vietnam. Yet it was used for 
that purpose. 
In 1973, Congress took action to make 
sure this would never happen again. It 
passed what is known as the War Pow-
ers Act. Now, the War Powers Act was 
passed in a strong bipartisan vote by 
both the House and Senate, and it was 
vetoed. Congress overrode the Presi-
dent’s veto because we knew that it 
was our responsibility to commit our 
troops to battle. 
What does the War Powers Act re-
quire? 
First, it requires consultation by the 
President with Congress, in every pos-
sible instance, before our committing 
troops to war. That is the exact lan-
guage in the War Powers Act. There 
are consultation requirements. Then 
there has to be reporting within 48 
hours of American troops being sent 
into hostilities or into situations in 
which imminent involvement in hos-
tilities is clearly indicated by the cir-
cumstances. Third, the War Powers Act 
requires an end to foreign military ac-
tion after 60 days unless Congress pro-
vides a declaration of war or an author-
ization for the operation to continue 
an authorization for use of military 
force, an AUMF. 
Why do we need S.J. Res. 68 if we 
have the War Powers Act? 
Like Vietnam, now in Iran, the Presi-
dent is usurping the constitutional 
powers of Congress by saying he has 
certain authorities that go well beyond 
what was intended in the Constitution 
or in the War Powers Act. 
Let me get to General Soleimani for 
one moment. He was killed on January 
2, 2020, in Baghdad. There is no sorrow 
over his loss. He was an evil person 
who caused the death of so many dif-
ferent people. He was clearly a person 
who is not missed in this world. That is 
absolutely accurate. 
But President Trump’s actions vio-
lated all three of the provisions of the 
War Powers Act that was passed in 1973 
to try to prevent this type of cir-
cumstance that happened in Vietnam 
from happening again. 
Now, why do I say all three? Well, 
first, was there an imminent threat 
that allowed the President to make 
this decision without congressional au-
thorization? 
Well, we have been through a classi-
fied briefing, and I am not going to 
talk about what was presented in that 
classified briefing, but I think it is fair 
to say that we were not presented with 
the documentation at all that there 
was 
an 
immediate 
threat 
against 
America. 
The President has not made that 
case, and we have heard public com-
ments that have been made by admin-
istration officials that they did not 
know about specific threats at that 
particular time. 
So, one, the War Powers Act was vio-
lated because there was not an immi-
nent threat before the President used 
military action. 
No. 2, we now know that this had 
been planned for some time as one of 
the potential operations that could 
have been given to the President to re-
spond to Iranian action; that is, taking 
out General Soleimani. So there was 
plenty of time to consult with Con-
gress, but yet, before the military ac-
tion, there was no prior consultation 
with Congress—a second violation of 
the War Powers Act. 
Then, third, congressional notifica-
tion and removal of troops within 60 
days. The President has not submitted 
nor does he intend to submit to Con-
gress an authorization for use of mili-
tary force or a declaration of war 
against Iran. He clearly does not in-
tend to do it, but he has made it clear 
by his own statements that he will use 
force again against Iran if he believes 
it is justified, and his determination of 
justification is not what Congress in-
tended when it passed the War Powers 
Act in 1973. 
Even more urgent, the President 
claims that he has authorization from 
Congress. So the President, through his 
lawyers, has said: Well, OK, maybe we 
don’t have the inherent power, but we 
have specific authorization that has 
been previously passed by Congress 
that allows us to use military action 
against Iran. 
So let me go through the two author-
izations that are still active and used 
by Presidents. 
First, we had the authorization to 
use military force that was passed in 
2002. This is the authorization that was 
passed to go after Iraq. 
Now, I must tell you I voted against 
this authorization. I thought that 
there was no evidence that Iraq was in-
volved in the attack on our country on 
September 11, 2001. I didn’t think there 
was evidence of that so I opposed that 
resolution in the House of Representa-
tives when I was a Member of the 
House of Representatives. That resolu-
tion says the use of force to defend the 
national security of the United States 
against the continuing threat posed by 
Iraq. We are talking about Iran, not 
Iraq. How could the President conceiv-
ably use the 2002 authorization to 
claim that he had authority to go after 
an Iranian general? I don’t understand 
that. I can’t figure that out for the life 
of me, but that argument has been 
made. 
Then we have the old fallback of the 
2001 AUMF that was passed imme-
diately after the attack on our country 
on September 11, 2001. That authoriza-
tion was passed ‘‘to use all necessary 
and appropriate force against those na-
tions, organizations, or persons that 
planned, authorized, committed, or 
aided the terrorist attack that oc-
curred on September 11, 2001.’’ 
Now, this has been used by many ad-
ministrations so it goes back well be-
fore President Trump in the misuse of 
the 2001 authorization. 
Iran was not involved in the attack 
on our country in 2001, 9/11. So how do 
you use this authorization to say you 
have authorization now to take out a 
general in Iran or use force in Iran? It 
is clear to me that that is a total 
misreading of the authority of Con-
gress. Congress never intended, when 
they voted for that authorization now 
19 years ago—almost 19 years—that it 
intended that it would be used as it is 
being used today. That is a total mis-
use of the authorization by Congress. 
So in regard to Iran today, there is 
no AUMF; we have not passed author-
ization for Iran; the President has al-
ready shown that he will act and will 
not comply with the War Powers Act; 
and he is likely to use force again that 
could lead to a lengthy military en-
gagement with Iran. That is a possi-
bility. 
So we need to pass S.J. Res. 68 be-
cause it is specific—it is specific to 
Iran—that there is no congressional 
authorization. 
And just as importantly, if the Presi-
dent wants to use the military, he 
must seek prior authorization from 
Congress as is envisioned in the Con-
stitution of the United States. It gives 
the President the power to protect us 
against imminent threat. 
So for good reason, Congress has the 
constitutional powers here. My genera-
tion paid a very heavy price because of 
the Vietnam war in the way that we 
got into the Vietnam war without the 
voice of the U.S. Congress giving the 
specific authorization. Let us not cede 
our responsibility under the Constitu-
tion or allow the President to exceed 
his. 
I urge my colleagues to support and 
vote for S.J. Res. 68.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1030 
February 12, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, when the 
Senate begins its debate, as it has been 
doing today on the War Powers Act, in 
considering this resolution, we are con-
sidering whether to do our duty to the 
Constitution. 
The debate over war powers is bigger 
than any one Senator, bigger than any 
one President, and bigger than any po-
litical party. The debate over war pow-
ers is a fundamental constitutional de-
bate, and the Constitution and our 
Founding Fathers were clear: The 
power to declare war lies in the legisla-
ture. 
Madison put it this way: The execu-
tive is the branch most prone to war. 
Therefore, the Constitution, with stud-
ied care, vested the power to declare 
war in the legislature. 
Yet we have increasingly deferred 
and delegated the war powers back to 
the executive. We have abdicated our 
role as the body that should be decid-
ing with the people when to go to war. 
While the President may have the 
power to repel an attack, Congress has 
done little to stop increasingly bold ar-
guments that everything is in response 
to an imminent attack. 
I will never forget President Obama 
coming to speak to the Republican cau-
cus a few years ago, and he said: Well, 
they were under imminent attack, and 
we were like: Who, in the Libyan war, 
and he said: Well, Benghazi. And it was 
like: For goodness’ sake, we thought 
imminent attack was of America, not 
of a foreign city. That is how far afield 
we have come, that a President would 
come to us and say: I can do whatever 
I want if there is an imminent attack 
of a foreign city. How ludicrous. 
Given Congress’s inaction, it should 
come as no surprise that administra-
tion lawyers increasingly argue that 
everything is imminent and that stat-
utes limiting their authority actually 
don’t limit their authority; that the 
statutes actually say they can do 
whatever they want. 
Presidents actually argue that arti-
cle II of the Constitution—this is what 
gives the President power. Article I is 
the congressional power; article II is 
the President. They argue that the ar-
ticle II section of the Constitution lets 
the President do anything he or she 
wishes; that there are no limits on 
Presidential authority. That is absurd. 
Under President Obama, we droned 
hundreds of people in Pakistan; we 
bombed Libya to help defeat Qadhafi; 
we put military personnel in dozens 
and dozens of countries around the 
world fighting militants and regional 
thugs here and there, but with each 
passing year it had less and less to do 
with 9/11. It is hard to explain to some-
one how a goat herder in Mali has any-
thing to do with the attacks of 9/11. Yet 
every President comes back to us and 
says: Well, you voted for this procla-
mation in 2001. It gives me the power 
to do whatever I want wherever I want. 
In our Republic, if we are going to go 
to war, the Constitution says you must 
come to Congress, not for consultation 
but for permission. 
Today’s vote is not a vote for or 
against the current President. Today’s 
vote is for or against the Constitution. 
Either you believe that war requires 
the permission of Congress or you 
don’t. 
Why is this vote necessary? Because 
we live in a topsy-turvy world, where 
Presidents now argue that their war 
power is absolute. Don’t talk to me. I 
will do what I want—but the Constitu-
tion envisioned that we did not ever 
want one person to decide when we 
went to war. 
Presidents now argue that a decades- 
old authorization of force against a 
long-deceased autocrat—Saddam Hus-
sein—is still valid and applies to an 
Iranian general, and that is absurd. 
That is insulting to the people; it is in-
sulting to the Constitution; and it 
shouldn’t be. 
You cannot argue that the Constitu-
tion gives the President unlimited 
power and say: Oh, well, if that doesn’t 
work, I am also arguing that in 2002 
Congress voted to go to war with Sad-
dam Hussein, and that gives me the 
power to kill an Iranian general. 
Presidents have also argued that 
bombing is not war. They argue some-
how that bombs are not war and that 
there is a certain attitude of, well, 
maybe 100 soldiers aren’t, maybe 1,000. 
What does it take to be at war? 
They argue sometimes that we are 
not in hostilities when we are dropping 
bombs everywhere around a country. 
They sometimes argue that battles are 
kinetic action and not really war. 
We have been at war too long in too 
many places. It is time to bring our 
soldiers home. 
This week, I joined the President to 
honor two of our soldiers who were 
killed in action. I stopped with the 
President at Dover Air Force Base. Let 
me tell you, it was a sad and somber 
memorial for two of our Nation’s he-
roes. But people need to think about 
this. This isn’t a chess game. This isn’t 
a geopolitical chess game and we are 
just moving troops here and there and 
they are somehow represented by sym-
bols on a big map or a board. This is 
about people. It is about our young 
people of our country, and they deserve 
better. Our soldiers deserve to know 
what they are fighting for. Our soldiers 
deserve to know what the mission is. 
Our soldiers deserve to know if we are 
making progress. They deserve to be 
told the truth. 
America’s longest war in Afghanistan 
is in its 20th year. We now have kids 
fighting who weren’t even born when 
the war began. 
My committee this week held a hear-
ing to discuss the Afghanistan Papers— 
papers that reveal that the highest 
ranking officials in our military and in 
our government and in our State De-
partment have known for many years 
that the Afghanistan war lacks a real 
mission; that it lacks a real national 
security rationale. 
My vote today is not simply about 
Iran or the killing of Soleimani. My 
vote today is about the constitutional 
requirement that Congress must de-
clare war. This vote should be 100 to 0. 
It is a vote for or against the Constitu-
tion. This is about acknowledging the 
Constitution says no one man, no one 
woman can take a nation to war. 
Many Members will quietly acknowl-
edge that the separation of powers as-
signed Congress the power to declare 
war, but when push comes to shove, 
many Senators are afraid to appear to 
oppose a President of their own party. 
For me, this debate is not about 
party. I have supported the constitu-
tional mandate that Congress must de-
clare war under both Democratic and 
Republican Presidents, and I will con-
tinue. 
For me, this debate is not a dry and 
esoteric or meaningless debate. It is a 
debate about life and death. It is a de-
bate that, more than any other debate, 
embodies our commitment to our sol-
diers. It is a debate that strikes at the 
heart of our duty to do everything pos-
sible to protect human life. 
Today’s vote is historic in that the 
majority of the House and the Senate 
will 
now 
be 
on 
record 
affirming 
Congress’s power over issues of war. 
Even at the height of the Vietnam war, 
the height of America’s probably most 
unpopular war, congressional majori-
ties did not stand up and assert their 
constitutional prerogative. Today we 
are doing that. That is a step forward. 
In the aftermath of the most partisan 
impeachment in our history, today, 
though, marks a high-water mark for 
the bipartisan assertion of the separa-
tion of powers. 
For me, it will have all been worth-
while when I see our troops returning 
home to their families safe and sound. 
For me, it will all be worthwhile when 
we finally end the Afghan war, when 
we finally end the Iraq war, and when 
we finally end the wars in Yemen and 
throughout Africa. When that day 
comes, I look forward to standing arm- 
in-arm across the political divide to 
welcome our brave soldiers home. Until 
that day, I will continue to fight for 
the truth that great nations don’t fight 
perpetual wars. 
Thank you.

S1031 
February 12, 2020 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the Senate floor to talk, once 
again, about the addiction crisis in our 
country. Over the past 4 years, I am 
told I have given over 64 speeches on 
this topic, and that is because it is a 
crisis, and a national one, and we have 
done a lot here in this Senate and also 
in the House of Representatives to deal 
with the issue. 
We passed some important legisla-
tion. We are making some progress, 
but, gosh, prescription opioids, heroin, 
fentanyl, methamphetamine, and co-
caine continue to harm so many people 
in our communities and so many of the 
families we represent. We put new poli-
cies in place to help deal with it—bet-
ter prevention, better treatment, and 
better recovery efforts. 
Among other things, we passed legis-
lation like the SUPPORT Act, the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-
ery Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, 
and the STOP Act. Through these new 
laws, we have also provided over $4 bil-
lion in additional Federal resources 
just over the last 3 years to be able to 
combat 
this 
epidemic—particularly, 
the opioid epidemic. 
In Ohio alone, our State received 
nearly $140 million through the CARA 
and Cures legislation. It has gone to-
ward innovative, evidence-based pro-
grams to try to figure out how we in-
tervene at the appropriate time to keep 
people who are addicted from over-
dosing and, instead, to get them into 
treatment and into longer term recov-
ery in a successful way. 
I have gone to visit many of these 
programs across our State, and I can 
tell you many of them are working, 
and they are working because local vol-
unteers, local communities, and the 
State are also involved. So that is the 
positive thing. I was very pleased that 
the year-end spending bill passed with 
a record $658 million, as an example, in 
funding for these CARA grants that 
again go to these innovative ideas back 
home. 
Let me give you an example of one. 
In many of our communities now, we 
have the ability, after somebody has 
overdosed, not to simply have them go 
back home and go to the same neigh-
borhood and get addicted, and continue 
to be addicted and overdose again and 
again and again, but, rather, to inter-
vene and to go there with law enforce-
ment, with treatment providers, with 
first responders, and get them into 
treatment. 
It is working. In a program I was re-
cently 
at 
in 
Columbus, 
OH, 
the 
RREACT Team, 80 percent of the peo-
ple whom they go to visit end up get-
ting into treatment. And the evidence 
is, not only are they getting into treat-
ment, but because there is the ability 
to monitor that, they are also going 
into longer term recovery programs. It 
is helping to save lives, but for the first 
responders, it is also a great relief be-
cause no one is more frustrated than 
they are. Think about it. You help 
somebody through an overdose by ap-
plying Narcan—that miracle drug that 
reverses the effects of the overdose— 
and the next day they are right back 
again. This is the right thing to do, 
and, again, we have made progress in 
that. 
The good news is, it looks like it is 
starting to pay off. After many, many 
years of increases in overdose deaths 
every single year, finally, we are mak-
ing progress. In States like mine, over-
dose deaths had climbed to the No. 1 
cause of death in our State; in other 
words, surpassing car accidents or any-
thing else. There were more people 
dying of drug overdose deaths than 
anything else. 
Nationwide, we had some great suc-
cess between 2017 and 2018. We now 
have those numbers in. In 2017, we had 
about 
70,700 
people 
who 
died 
of 
overdoses. In 2018, it went down to 
about 67,700. That is a decrease of 4 per-
cent. Now, that is nothing to write 
home about, 4 percent. On the other 
hand, this is after three decades of in-
creased overdose deaths every year and 
in some years substantial increases. So 
just to have that 4-percent decrease— 
and we are waiting for the 2019 figures 
to become available—was a big deal. 
In Ohio, we are one of the States that 
has been hardest hit. In 2018, our num-
ber was a 22.4-percent reduction. We 
were one of the States that led the 
country in this, and I am proud of that. 
That means a lot of lives saved. Still, 
though, the overdose rate is way too 
high—way too high. 
On the positive side, I think we are 
also seeing more accountability for the 
opioid crisis, in particular. As courts 
around the country hear cases of those 
affected by prescription opioids, like 
OxyContin, these drug companies are 
being held accountable by individual 
States, by some local governments, and 
by the Federal Government. Every day 
we learn more about what they did and 
how wrong it was. 
The sheer number of pain pills that 
drug 
companies 
pumped 
into 
the 
United States is astounding, with more 
than 100 billion pain pills between 2006 
and 2014. So during that one period of 
time, 8 years, there were 100 billion 
pain pills. 
We have one county in Southern 
Ohio, Scioto County, where we had 48 
million opioid pain pills distributed by 
manufacturers during those 8 years. By 
the way, that is 617 pills for every man, 
woman, and child in that one county in 
Southern Ohio. We were flooded with 
pain pills that were addictive, and we 
have to be sure that that kind of a cri-
sis doesn’t start again. 
As I travel around the State of Ohio, 
I hear stories all the time of people 
who had an accident or had an injury, 
and they took pain medication pre-
scribed by a doctor. That led to phys-
ical addiction. Something in their 
brain changed. They became addicted. 
They couldn’t get the prescription 
drugs because they are too expensive or 
not accessible enough, so they turned 
to heroin. In many cases, the tragedy 
that occurred was not just an overdose 
but sometimes an overdose and a life 
lost. I hear this all the time. 
Just this morning at my weekly 
Buckeye Coffee, where we have con-
stituents come in once a week and 
meet with Ohioans, I met an impres-
sive young man from northeast Ohio. 
He told me about his brother, Dylan. 
He reminded me that I had met his 
mom. I already knew about Dylan be-
cause his mom had told me, but Dylan 
struggled with pain pill addiction be-
fore tragically dying of an opioid over-
dose. It is a pattern that we have seen 
too often in our communities, and it 
needs to stop. 
We are making some progress there, I 
think partly because of the lawsuits, 
partly because we increased awareness, 
partly because of the Federal legisla-
tion we discussed that has helped on 
this, and partly because doctors and 
others are beginning to get the mes-
sage. 
We have cracked down on pill mills 
as well. I mentioned Portsmouth, OH, 
and Scioto County, OH, where there 
were hundreds of pain pills per person. 
They had pill mills. Because of all of 
that, the number of prescription pain 
pills prescribed between 2013 and 2018 
fell by more than 80 million—about a 
33-percent 
decrease 
nationwide. 
So 
pushing back against this opioid flow 
that flourished for way too long here in 
the United States is helping, and that 
is a positive sign as well. 
Again, while the CDC—Centers for 
Disease Control—has shown an overall 
decrease in drug overdose deaths for 
the past 18 months or so, I want to talk 
tonight about some new troubling 
trends and the need for us in Congress 
not to take our eye off the ball because 
sometimes around here, you get a little 
progress, and you think: OK. Let’s go 
on to the next thing. Unfortunately, 
that is not the way addiction works, 
and we have seen this over time. 
Back in the 1990s, we thought we had 
solved the cocaine crisis; we didn’t. 
Now some think we have solved the 
opioid crisis; we haven’t. In addition, 
there are new troubling trends I want 
to talk about tonight. 
The most worrying is, while the over-
all number of opioid deaths has fallen, 
the number of overdose deaths related 
to the very deadliest of opioids—syn-
thetic 
opioids 
like 
fentanyl 
or 
carfentanil—has actually increased. In 
fact, in 2018, more deaths were attrib-
uted to fentanyl than to heroin and 
prescription drugs combined. So it has 
shifted. Think about this. From the 
prescription drugs to the heroin, now 
to fentanyl. 
Fentanyl is 50 times more powerful 
than heroin. A few flakes of this stuff 
can kill you. Unfortunately, it is being 
mixed into other drugs, partly because 
it is so powerful and a few flakes can 
kill you. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control, 40 percent of drug overdoses in 
2017 were at least partly because of

February 12, 2020 
fentanyl use—40 percent. It is by far 
the largest problem. That data also 
showed that overdose deaths due to 
fentanyl had increased by 88 percent 
per year since 2013. So it has been 
going up really since the 2013, 2014 time 
period. 
We are seeing this mixing occur in a 
lot of overdose reports from Ohio com-
munities, where declining prescription 
opioid and heroin use has opened the 
door now for this other form of addic-
tion. In particular, psychostimulants, 
as they are called, like crystal meth 
and cocaine, are being laced with 
fentanyl. This is a deadly combination. 
According to our State’s deputy attor-
ney general for law enforcement, Carol 
O’Brien, Ohio law enforcement officials 
in 2018 tested double the amount of 
methamphetamine samples as they had 
in 2017 and triple the amount from 2016. 
So crystal meth is, unfortunately, 
making a resurgence in our commu-
nities. 
By the way, you may remember in 
the past couple of decades in your com-
munity you heard about these meth 
houses, where people would be cooking 
meth, literally, in a home or in a trail-
er or in the basement and causing envi-
ronmental concerns and so on. You 
don’t hear about that anymore. Do you 
know why? It is because crystal meth 
coming straight from Mexico is so pow-
erful and so cheap that people don’t 
have to make it at home anymore. 
That is a bad thing because this has ex-
panded to the people who have become 
addicted to methamphetamine because 
of this powerful crystal meth. 
Today I met with law enforcement 
officers from around the State of Ohio. 
The FOP was in town, the Fraternal 
Order of Police. Many of my colleagues 
met with them. They confirmed this 
troubling trend. They told me that the 
crystal meth and the cocaine, because 
they are psychostimulants, are much 
more difficult for them to deal with 
and puts their lives and their safety 
more at risk, as well as the citizens 
whom they are there to protect. Why? 
Because it causes a more violent reac-
tion. 
Think about it. With heroin, with 
other 
opioids, 
prescription 
drugs, 
fentanyl, people talk about the nodding 
effect. It calms people more. Whereas, 
with heroin, with cocaine, and with the 
other psychostimulants, like crystal 
meth, it makes people more agitated 
and more violent. We have seen not 
just more assaults on individuals but 
more violent crime overall coming out 
of this. So it is a shift that is impact-
ing our police officers and our citizens, 
as well, in terms of increased violent 
crime. 
I am really pleased to say that the 
legislation we passed in December— 
just about a month and a half ago—re-
sponded to this issue of the increase in 
meth and cocaine. It is because it in-
cluded our legislation called the Com-
bating Meth and Cocaine Act. It is a 
really important bill. Basically, what 
it says is, let’s give local communities 
the flexibility to use the opioid grant 
money that I talked about earlier, that 
has increased over the last 3 or 4 years, 
also to be used for psychostimulants. I 
felt very strongly about this because I 
was hearing it back home: Thank you 
very much for your help on the opioid 
crisis. By the way, we have shifted now 
in our community. Opioids are not as 
big a deal, but we need the funding to 
also help us deal with the consequences 
of crystal meth or cocaine. 
I thank my colleagues for passing 
that legislation. It is going to make a 
big difference, and I think we will now 
begin to see the ability to address this 
new threat. 
The U.S. attorneys for the Northern 
and Southern Districts of Ohio have re-
cently weighed in and told me what is 
going on in terms of this mixing of co-
caine and crystal meth with fentanyl. 
They say it is a crisis. Preliminary 
data from Cuyahoga County, which is 
in Cleveland, OH, suggested about 45 
percent of the fatal overdoses in the 
county last year were associated with 
cocaine, much of that mixed with 
fentanyl. By the way, that is twice the 
amount of heroin overdoses over that 
same time period from the previous 
year, which shows how, again, the 
frontlines of addiction have shifted, 
partly in response to our successes on 
the opioid front. 
We are hearing similar things in the 
Southern District of Ohio, where more 
than a third of overdose deaths are 
from cocaine and fentanyl, where they 
just had 10 overdose deaths from the 
combination of fentanyl and cocaine in 
the last several days. 
I met with the Columbus, OH, police 
chief, Tom Quinlan, on Friday, in the 
middle of a spike there, a spike in over-
dose deaths that they have seen from 
this mixture. In the first 10 days of 
February, this month, Columbus, OH, 
Franklin 
County, 
had 
28 
overdose 
deaths involving some combination of 
fentanyl and cocaine—28 in 10 days. 
I was actually in Columbus on Satur-
day, a day in which five people died 
from overdoses of a mixture of fentanyl 
and cocaine. 
Just yesterday, the Columbus police 
informed me that in one drug bust, 
they seized over 200 grams of cocaine 
and nearly 2 kilograms of fentanyl. 
That is enough to kill about 1 million 
people. 
Again, we have made some progress 
on the opioid front, no question about 
it. We have made progress in terms of 
the 
overprescribing 
of 
prescription 
drugs, but, unfortunately, my col-
leagues, this issue is not going away. 
The more flexible funding we got in at 
the end of the year is important, and 
we will begin to see that take effect 
here over the next several months—it 
is just being implemented now—but we 
have to deal with it. 
The other thing we have to deal with 
in terms of fentanyl is being sure that 
some evil scientist doesn’t slightly 
change the molecular compound of 
fentanyl, making it an analog of 
fentanyl that is not illegal. You have 
to schedule a drug to make it illegal. 
As we have seen an uptick in these 
fentanyl copycats, we have seen the re-
ality that it is not just about fentanyl. 
It is also about carfentanil, and it is 
also about other analogs. 
As an example, we had an 819-percent 
increase from just a year ago in Cleve-
land with carfentanil deaths in 2019. So 
from 2018 to 2019, there was an 819-per-
cent increase. 
That is why the DEA—the Drug En-
forcement Administration—has made 
the right call in 2018 in temporarily 
making these fentanyl-related sub-
stances, like carfentanil, illegal to pos-
sess, 
transport, 
or 
manufacture. 
Thanks to that designation, our law 
enforcement officials have been better 
able to protect our communities by 
seizing and destroying this fentanyl-re-
lated substance because it is illegal. 
We had a real problem in the last 
couple of months here in Congress be-
cause, as of early this month—just last 
week—that scheduling of those analogs 
expired, and we almost had a situation 
where these drugs were going to be-
come illegal. Thank goodness, at the 
last minute, we stepped in, and we pro-
vided a temporary extension; other-
wise, again, last week, we would have 
had a real crisis. 
Unfortunately, the temporary exten-
sion, like so much stuff around here, 
was kind of kicking the can down the 
road. So in May of next year—just a 
year and a few months from now— 
again, it is going to expire. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join 
me, Senator MANCHIN, and others on 
both sides of the aisle in passing legis-
lation that puts these analogs on the 
schedule, making them illegal perma-
nently. It should be permanent. The 
legislation 
is 
called 
the 
FIGHT 
Fentanyl Act. Again, it just codifies 
what the DEA has done but also gives 
them the flexibility to be able to 
schedule new things, as, again, these 
scientists come up with ways to slight-
ly alter the molecular compounds for 
these incredibly dangerous and deadly 
drugs. 
By the way, our legislation has 
strong bipartisan support but also has 
the support of every single attorney 
general in every State in America and 
six territories. Fifty-six of our attor-
neys general have come forward and 
endorsed our bill, and I thank them for 
that. 
Let’s 
do 
that. 
Let’s 
push 
back 
against 
these 
deadly 
copycats 
of 
fentanyl and be sure that our commu-
nities are just a little bit safer. 
Again, we have made a lot of progress 
in the fight, but as we have seen, addic-
tion—not a particular drug but addic-
tion—is really the crisis we face. As we 
have made progress against opioids, in-
cluding an unprecedented Federal re-
sponse here—and I appreciate that very 
much—we now see the playing field 
changing. 
We 
see 
these 
psychostimulants 
like 
cocaine 
and 
crystal meth making a comeback. We 
see this mixing with fentanyl.

S1033 
February 12, 2020 
Again, the funding bill passed last 
year will help as it begins to imple-
ment these changes. We need to be sure 
that the FIGHT Fentanyl legislation is 
passed, and we need to be sure that we 
continue the funding. It is easy to say: 
Well, this crisis is better; let’s move 
on. We have to keep our eye on the 
ball. 
So I thank my colleagues as we go 
through the funding process again, but 
we have to keep the funding for the 
CARA legislation and others. 
We also have a new bill called CARA 
2.0, so Comprehensive Addiction and 
Recovery Act 2.0, and it expands the 
reach of these evidence-based programs 
we are talking about, particularly 
longer term recovery programs, be-
cause we have learned that it is so crit-
ical to actually get somebody into re-
covery and keep them in recovery for a 
long enough time so they don’t relapse. 
In that legislation, we also have im-
portant legislation with regard to 
opioid prescriptions because that is 
still a problem. We say that there 
should be a limit of 3 days for acute 
pain—not for chronic pain but for 
acute pain, limit it to 3 days. That 
comes from a recommendation by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention but also from the FDA. 
I have heard from too many fami-
lies—like the young man I heard from 
this morning—about someone whose 
child has become addicted because the 
doctor gave them too many opioids. By 
the way, I now know several families 
whose son or daughter was given 
opioids when he or she had a wisdom 
tooth removed, which apparently is one 
of the top two or three most common 
procedures in America. Doctors and 
dentists are still giving these kids 
opioids. I think that is wrong, and I 
think that should be stopped alto-
gether. In the meantime, 3 days is a 
sensible limit. A doctor can always pre-
scribe more if you have an issue. And I 
think there are proper exceptions for 
chronic pain. 
I think our legislation would make a 
big difference. It also has a prescrip-
tion drug monitoring program, which 
would require States to make their 
monitoring programs and their data 
available in other States because peo-
ple go from State to State to get these 
prescription pain pills. This would help 
against overprescribing, making sure 
people are treated as soon as possible 
and identified. 
I urge my colleagues who are not yet 
cosponsors of any of these bills—the 
FIGHT Fentanyl bill and the CARA 2.0 
bill—to help us and to join us in re-
sponding to this ever-evolving chal-
lenge we have, which is not just an 
opioid problem; it is an addiction prob-
lem. Every State represented in this 
Chamber is affected by this epidemic, 
and these two bills at least provide us 
an opportunity to continue to give law 
enforcement the tools they need to 
give our communities the help they 
need to be able to overcome this crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, the Con-
stitution 
vests 
Congress 
with 
the 
power to declare war and ultimately to 
authorize the use of military force in 
order to provide a critical check on a 
President’s decision to deploy troops 
overseas. Congress has for too long ab-
dicated this responsibility in deference 
to Presidents from both parties. 
Presidents have used a broad inter-
pretation of the 2001 and 2002 author-
izations for the use of military force to 
justify American military interven-
tions in far-flung theaters such as 
Yemen and North Africa. I have sup-
ported bipartisan efforts to revisit 
these authorizations because nearly 20 
years later, they are still being used to 
justify action unforeseen by the Con-
gress that initially approved them. 
This effort has become more urgent 
as this President’s reckless, impulsive 
actions are bringing us precipitously 
close to war with Iran. Contrary to 
whatever he says, Donald Trump’s Iran 
policy has not made us safer. In fact, 
his Iran policy has undermined Amer-
ica’s national security, isolated the 
United States from our allies, put the 
safety of American troops at risk, and, 
yes, brought us closer to war. 
To understand how we arrived at this 
moment and why Congress needs to 
act, we should begin by evaluating the 
consequences of the President’s mis-
guided and dangerous decision to with-
draw from the Iran nuclear deal. 
By all accounts, the administration 
inherited a deal that was working, one 
painstakingly negotiated over many 
months with the UK, France, Germany, 
Russia, China, and Iran. 
It bears repeating. The deal explic-
itly stated in its first paragraph that 
‘‘Iran reaffirms that under no cir-
cumstances will Iran ever seek, develop 
or acquire any nuclear weapons,’’ and 
it put a comprehensive, intrusive, and 
verifiable enforcement mechanism in 
place to achieve this objective. It 
blocks pathways Iran would need to 
produce the highly enriched uranium 
or plutonium it would take to produce 
a nuclear weapon. Under the verifica-
tion regime created by the deal, inter-
national inspectors from the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency, the 
IAEA, were afforded extensive access 
within Iran to ensure their compliance. 
The Iran nuclear deal was reached 
through tough, principled diplomacy. 
These negotiations culminated in an 
agreement that world leaders could 
credibly declare would prevent Iran 
from ever obtaining nuclear weapons. 
In May 2018, President Trump reck-
lessly undermined our credibility and 
isolated the United States from our al-
lies by unilaterally withdrawing from 
the Iran nuclear deal. It is important 
to emphasize that Iran was in compli-
ance with the agreement when the 
President tore it up. 
Our unilateral withdrawal from the 
agreement and the administration’s 
subsequent so-called maximum pres-
sure campaign has exposed the United 
States to enormous risk. We have seen 
the consequences almost every day for 
the past 2 years as Donald Trump has 
engaged in an escalating and increas-
ingly violent tit-for-tat with Iran. 
The President’s chaotic escalation 
culminated with his impulsive and in-
credibly risky decision to target and 
kill high-level Iranian and Iraqi mili-
tary officials, including Iranian Gen-
eral Soleimani, on Iraqi soil. 
The question before us is not whether 
General Soleimani deserved this fate. 
He was a loathsome figure who was re-
sponsible for killing many U.S. service-
members and for orchestrating ter-
rorism throughout the Middle East. 
The question before us is whether car-
rying out this risky and provocative 
act made the United States and the 
Middle East safer or more secure. It 
has not. 
Over 
the 
past 
month, 
the 
con-
sequences of the President’s impulsive 
actions have become clearer. We now 
know President Trump directed the at-
tack without notifying leaders in Con-
gress or our Iraqi partners or even our 
allies who have troops positioned in 
Iraq. He ordered the attack without 
preparing for what came next, exposing 
the United States to further hostilities 
without a plan for how to deescalate 
tensions. 
After Iran retaliated with a coordi-
nated missile strike on American mili-
tary infrastructure in Iraq, the Presi-
dent was quick to reassure the public 
that no American soldiers were harmed 
in the counterattack. We now know 
this was a lie. After weeks of denials— 
or even comments from the President 
that some troops were suffering from 
‘‘headaches’’—the Pentagon on Monday 
finally acknowledged that 109 service-
members suffered traumatic brain inju-
ries in the Iranian attack. For the 
President of the United States to make 
light of these serious injuries—injuries 
that, in many cases, may impact these 
soldiers for the rest of their lives—is 
unconscionable and dishonors the serv-
ice and sacrifices made every day by 
our men and women in uniform. 
In a sign that tensions continue to 
escalate, the President has deployed 
more than 14,000 additional service-
members to the Middle East in the 
wake 
of 
the 
strike 
on 
General 
Soleimani, exposing even more Ameri-
cans to potential retaliation from Iran 
or its regional proxies. These develop-
ments further reinforce our conclusion 
that President Trump did not give 
much thought to the consequences of 
his actions. 
The 
administration 
has 
provided 
ever-evolving and very troubling after- 
the-fact explanations that fail to as-
suage our concerns about this impul-
sive decision. Only a few weeks ago, 
the President tweeted in all caps that 
‘‘Iran will never have a nuclear weap-
on.’’ Given that the President tore up 
the Iran nuclear deal which would have 
prevented Iran from ever getting a nu-
clear weapon, one cannot help but

question where this bellicose rhetoric 
is coming from and what it portends. 
The American people have made it 
explicitly clear that they do not want 
to go to war with Iran, especially if 
war is the result of the President’s 
reckless and impulsive actions. It is 
therefore imperative that Congress ex-
ercise 
its 
exclusive—exclusive—war 
powers under article I of the Constitu-
tion to prevent this President from 
launching a disastrous war with Iran. 
In normal times, we could have con-
fidence during a crisis like this that 
the President of the United States 
would mobilize a whole-of-government 
response to this crisis, and in normal 
times, the President would lead our al-
lies and the international community 
in seeking a diplomatic outcome to our 
escalating tensions with Iran, but 
these are not normal times. 
Congress must reassert its constitu-
tional authority by demanding the 
President seek explicit authorization 
prior to any military action against 
Iran. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Senator TIM KAINE’s War 
Powers Resolution tomorrow. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to join my colleagues, 
many of whom have spoken already in 
support of S.J. Res. 68, which I am 
proud to cosponsor. It prohibits an un-
authorized, unconstitutional war with 
Iran. It seeks to prevent the Trump ad-
ministration from stumbling into a 
real and reckless military conflict. I 
want to thank bipartisan colleagues 
who have provided leadership in this ef-
fort, and it has been truly bipartisan as 
an effort. I appreciate their efforts and 
from many other colleagues to reassert 
our constitutional war powers and to 
represent the will of the American peo-
ple. 
Americans do not want a new war. 
They do not want another endless mili-
tary conflict that harms our national 
interests without protecting our na-
tional 
security. 
The 
Constitution 
trumps any statute. Without congres-
sional 
authorization 
and 
anything 
short of a declaration of war from the 
Congress, starting a war with Iran 
would be unconstitutional. 
Congress did not authorize war with 
Iran when it passed an authorization to 
use force against al-Qaida more than 18 
years ago in the wake of 9/11. Congress 
did not authorize war with Iran when it 
passed an authorization to use military 
force against Saddam Hussein’s regime 
in 2002. Very simply, Congress has not 
authorized war with Iran in any way, 
shape, or legal form. 
The President’s authorizations for 
use of military force in no way cover 
starting a new war with Iran. We can-
not let the intent of either of those au-
thorizations to be so distorted and 
stretched as to be a pretense for such a 
war. That is why this resolution is so 
important. I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of it tomorrow. 
But just as alarming as the lack of 
legal authorization for war, is the 
Trump administration’s lack of strat-
egy. It isn’t that we have a dangerous 
policy toward Iran. It is that we have 
no 
policy, 
no 
strategy, 
and 
no 
endgame, which is the most dangerous 
situation of all. 
I am pleased that we have deesca-
lated the dramatic rise in tensions be-
tween Iran and the United States, 
which well serves the interests of both 
countries. We must continue the poten-
tial for reducing, not escalating, mili-
tary tensions, but President Trump’s 
reckless actions that brought us so 
close to military conflict are still in 
play. We need to continue to deesca-
late, not raise, the level of tension, if 
possible. 
These kinds of reckless actions, in 
fact, brought us close to expulsion 
from Iraq and halted key training exer-
cises with our allies in the counter- 
ISIS mission. As is the case with most 
of the Trump administration’s military 
strategy—or lack of it—we are just 
lurching from one crisis to another, 
with no objectives, no means to an end, 
no decision on ending, all putting our 
security and our allies at grave risk. 
Congress, not to its credit, has failed to 
conduct critical public oversight that 
is necessary to hold the administration 
accountable and to insist on a strat-
egy, an endgame, a set of objectives. 
The Trump administration has kept 
Congress and the American people in 
the dark under the guise of classifica-
tion. I will say, on a personal note, 
that at the end of so many of our clas-
sified briefings in the SCIF, I will say 
to a military officer or to an intel-
ligence community representative: Our 
adversaries and our enemies know 
what you have just told us because you 
are telling us about what they are 
doing. And they know we know, and we 
know they know. In fact, they know a 
great deal about what we are doing. 
The only ones who don’t know are the 
American people. They are kept in the 
dark. 
The Trump administration cannot 
wage war while hiding behind classi-
fication gag orders behind closed doors. 
The Trump administration tried to 
make the claim that there was an ‘‘im-
minent threat’’ to justify the strike 
against Soleimani. I disagree. The 
Trump administration failed to provide 
the evidence in any setting, classified 
or not, to support this claim, and the 
American people deserve to know our 
path forward with Iran. 
There is no conceivable reason that 
our goals must be kept secret from 
Members of Congress or the people we 
represent, and we certainly must pre-
vent a reckless administration from 
pursuing a war when it is unwilling to 
account to the American people. In 
short, there is a fundamental purpose 
that is served by a declaration of war. 
It gives the people who will have to 
sacrifice in that war a voice in the de-
cision. We represent those people—the 
families of soldiers, marines, airmen, 
and sailors whose lives will be in 
harm’s way, as well as themselves. It 
gives a voice to the experts in this 
body who may have a perspective and a 
wisdom on these topics. That is a use-
ful check on the executive branch. 
Let us not forget that military ac-
tions conducted without a strategy and 
without the consent of the American 
people have real consequences for all 
who serve our Nation in uniform. 
We continue to hear reports about 
the number of troops who have suffered 
brain injuries in the Iran strike against 
Iraq military bases. The total is now 
up to 109 American servicemembers. 
The President of the United States has 
minimized those kinds of injuries as 
headaches, but, in fact, traumatic 
brain 
injury—concussion, 
post-trau-
matic stress—are among the most 
painful and damaging wounds of war, 
in part because they are invisible and 
they are sometimes minimized. 
So let us never forget the con-
sequences of war—the consequences to 
our economy, to our faith in American 
democracy, to the credibility of our 
leaders, to our people in lives lost and 
damaged. That is true especially of a 
war that has never been authorized by 
Congress and fails to have the support 
of the American people. 
That is why this vote is so important 
today. There are many, many reasons 
to vote in favor of S.J. Res. 68. I call on 
my colleagues to send a clear, unmis-
takable message to this administra-
tion: You do not have congressional au-
thorization, you do not have the sup-
port of the American people, and you 
do not have permission from this Con-
gress, under the Constitution, to wage 
war or to begin it against Iran. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am 
proud to rise in support of S.J. Res. 68, 
the Kaine-Lee resolution to ‘‘remove 
United States Armed Forces from hos-
tilities against the Islamic Republic of 
Iran or any part of its government or 
military.’’ 
This resolution is crucial at a mo-
mentous moment in our Nation’s his-
tory. As U.S. Senators, we are no 
strangers to tough decisions. When this 
institution is functioning properly, we 
make such decisions all the time. 
There are tough questions, and we 
make tough decisions on which pro-
grams to fund or on who sits in judg-
ment over their fellow citizens on the 
Federal bench or on issues of civil 
rights or equality or fairness. Yet, 
without doubt, the most difficult deci-
sion any Senator will ever face is 
whether to authorize war—whether to, 
through such authorization, open the

gates to send the men and women of 
our Armed Forces into harm’s way. 
It is a solemn responsibility that all 
of us here take very seriously, and it is 
a responsibility that the Founding Fa-
thers intended to rest solely here in 
the Congress of the United States of 
America, not down Pennsylvania Ave-
nue, in the White House, not in the 
hands of any one person sitting in the 
Oval Office. 
At the Constitutional Convention in 
1787, George Mason, a delegate from 
Virginia, said he was ‘‘against giving 
the power of war to the executive’’ be-
cause the President ‘‘is not safely to be 
trusted with it.’’ 
In speaking to the Pennsylvania rati-
fying 
convention 
that 
same 
year, 
James Wilson stated: 
This system will not hurry us into war; it 
is calculated to guard against it. It will not 
be in the power of a single man, or a single 
body of men [such as just the Senate or just 
the House], to involve us in such distress, for 
the important power of declaring war is vest-
ed in the legislature at large. 
James Madison, the ‘‘Father of the 
Constitution,’’ wrote to Thomas Jeffer-
son in 1798: 
The Constitution supposes, what the His-
tory of all Governments demonstrates, that 
the Executive is the branch of power most 
interested in war, and most prone to it. It 
has accordingly with studied care vested the 
question of war to the Legislature. 
All of these comments and so many 
more are about the gravity of deciding 
to go to war—deciding on whether hun-
dreds or thousands or tens of thousands 
will walk into the face of danger, suffer 
injuries, suffer death. Questions about 
war are questions of great human ca-
lamity that cannot be taken lightly. 
They cannot be taken at the spur of 
the moment. They cannot be taken 
with the judgment of a single indi-
vidual. 
Our Founders noted that the decision 
should not be by any single President, 
not by a particular individual. This is 
not about the individual in the Oval Of-
fice at this moment; it is about the 
Founders’ vision that it should be the 
collective decision of Congress, rep-
resenting the people of the United 
States, to weigh this question of na-
tional defense—whether or not we 
should send our sons and now our 
daughters into harm’s way in a mili-
tary fashion, where many will be in-
jured and many will die. It is an issue 
of the National Treasury as well be-
cause the cost of war is a huge cost in 
blood and a huge cost in injuries and a 
huge cost to the Treasury. That is why 
this responsibility was placed with us 
and with the House of Representatives. 
In this Constitution—and all Sen-
ators here probably have one in their 
desks—one just simply has to look in 
article I, section 8, which is where that 
specific responsibility is given to us, 
not to the President, not to the execu-
tive. Upon coming into this body, we 
did swear an oath to this Constitution, 
not to some vision of our personal de-
sire that maybe a President would be 
better at making this decision and not 
to any scholars’ opinion but to this 
document, which vests its power in this 
body, not in the President of the 
United States. 
For too long, Congress has allowed a 
steady expansion of the exercise of 
military 
power 
without 
authoriza-
tion—without a declaration of war 
from Congress. So this is one of those 
rare moments in which we are standing 
up to say: No. Any decision to conduct 
war against Iran needs to come in ac-
cordance with the Constitution, in ac-
cordance with the War Powers Act, in 
accordance with the decision and de-
bate that would occur here. 
S.J. Res. 68 lays out what the War 
Powers Act reads, which is, ‘‘At any 
time that United States Armed Forces 
are engaged in hostilities outside the 
territory of the United States, its pos-
sessions and territories without a dec-
laration of war or specific statutory 
authorization, such forces shall be re-
moved by the President if the Congress 
so directs.’’ This is a debate over 
whether the Congress should so direct. 
Indeed, it also lays out in this docu-
ment the vision of our Constitution 
and reads that the question of whether 
U.S. forces should be engaged in hos-
tilities against Iran should be answered 
following a full briefing to Congress 
and the American public of the issues 
at stake—a public debate in Congress 
and a congressional vote as con-
templated by the Constitution. 
This resolution does not read that 
Congress will not debate the issue; it 
reads that Congress should debate the 
issue if the President so requests and 
come to a decision as to whether to 
open the gates of our Nation to war. It 
then proceeds to do exactly what the 
War Powers Act provides for, which is 
to ‘‘[direct] the President to terminate 
the use of United States Armed Forces 
from hostilities against the Islamic Re-
public of Iran or any part of the gov-
ernment or military unless explicitly 
authorized by a declaration of war or a 
specific Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force.’’ 
This is all about the vision of our 
Constitution. Are we going to support 
it? Are we going to say no to this war-
fare unless it is authorized as envi-
sioned by the Constitution or are we 
going to say, ‘‘No. We don’t want the 
burden of that responsibility. It is a 
tough decision to make. We are not 
sure we will get it right, so we will just 
let the executive do what he wants 
even though the Constitution says no’’? 
Let us honor the vision of the Con-
stitution. Let us support this that is 
before us. Let us ponder how easy it is 
for there to be a cycle of provocation, 
an escalation. We have seen that in 
Iran. Iran is not a friendly power to the 
United States of America. Iran has 
been involved in activities that we 
greatly oppose in its supporting forces 
in Syria, in Lebanon, and Yemen; in its 
developing ballistic missiles; in its cre-
ating concerns inside of its neighbor 
Iraq with its Iranian militias. The 
United States has been involved in this 
cycle of provocation and escalation. 
We made a deal with Iran of eco-
nomic assistance to Iran if they aban-
doned their nuclear program. They 
abandoned the nuclear program, and 
the inspectors certified they had aban-
doned it. Then, we have broken the 
deal, and we have tightened the sanc-
tions, making life very difficult for the 
people of Iran. 
Iran launched rockets at our forces 
inside of Iraq, and the United States 
responded and attacked militias spon-
sored by Iran, killing a good score of 
Iranians in the process and assassi-
nating an Iranian general. Iran re-
sponded with ballistic missiles attacks 
at the U.S. forces in Iraq, injuring, at 
this moment, an estimated 100 U.S. 
forces—a cycle of provocation and es-
calation. 
We are on the edge of war. We are in-
volved in hostilities that have not been 
authorized, and the Constitution essen-
tially says, in this situation, it is 
Congress’s responsibility to debate and 
wrestle with whether to unleash our 
forces against Iran. So let’s carry that 
responsibility, and as we do so, let’s 
think how close we were to a third 
major war in the Middle East. 
We had a war and are still at war in 
Afghanistan. Now, the authorization 
for the use of military force in regard 
to Afghanistan was very narrowly tai-
lored. That authorization said that our 
forces are authorized to attack those 
who attacked us on 9/11 and those who 
harbor those forces. 
It is now as if that AUMF had lan-
guage added to it, language which es-
sentially said and: any other group we 
disagree with in the world. The words 
that are often quoted as being part of 
that AUMF are ‘‘and related forces.’’ 
But do you know what? That lan-
guage isn’t in that AUMF. This Con-
gress gave a very, very narrow assign-
ment for the authorization of force, 
and it has been expanded massively. We 
could debate whether or not that au-
thorization has been stretched to the 
breaking point. I think it has. I think 
it has been abused. It has been mis-
used, and it dishonors the fact that 
Congress was so specific with that au-
thorization. 
The result is that here we are, 19 
years later. We didn’t pursue a simple 
mission of taking out the training 
camps. We pursued a mission that has 
cost this Nation $1 trillion and thou-
sands of our sons and daughters and 
tens of thousands with lifetime inju-
ries. 
So we have that war. We know what 
kind of damage and costs there can be 
to an ill-considered strategy. 
Then, we have the war we had 
against Iraq and authorized by a 2002 
authorization for use of military force, 
or AUMF, and this was also very nar-
rowly crafted. The President is author-
ized to use the Armed Forces of the 
United States as he determines to be 
necessary and appropriate in order to 
defend the national security of the 
United States against the continuing 
threat posed by Iraq—not posed by any-
one else, just by Iraq—and to enforce

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1036 
February 12, 2020 
the relevant United Nations Security 
Council resolutions regarding Iraq— 
very, very specific. 
Now, the administration is arguing 
that this AUMF from 2002, about Iraq, 
provides authority to go to war against 
Iran. It is just like the stretching of 
the 2001 AUMF that said go after those 
who harbored the 9/11 terrorists but has 
been stretched to go after other groups 
all over the world. 
But in both these cases, it was an au-
thorization. Congress did debate. Yes, 
they have been abused after they were 
passed, but what there wasn’t was an 
open door without Congress involved. 
So we must do our job here and real-
ize the gravity of these conflicts and 
get the full, extensive information and 
make sure there is no fake news in that 
information. 
On the Iraq AUMF, this body oper-
ated on the solemn guarantee that 
there were weapons of mass destruc-
tion being developed by Iraq. It proved 
out to be false. 
So when we do hold the debate over 
Iran, let’s make sure we get the abso-
lutely honest intelligence, not the spin, 
not the cherry-picked intelligence, not 
partial, not selected to drive a conclu-
sion—the honest, fully honest, situa-
tion of our activities and their activi-
ties and the threats that they pose. 
That is the responsibility we have— 
to make sure that the information we 
wrestle with is absolutely accurate and 
then to weigh the heavy cost of dif-
ferent strategies that may or may not 
involve force before we vote for force. 
It is a big responsibility, and I have 
heard Members of this Chamber say: 
You know what; it is such a tough deci-
sion. What if I get it wrong? Let’s just 
let the Executive make that decision. 
If I misjudge it and don’t vote to go to 
war and, for example, maybe there 
were those weapons of mass destruc-
tion equivalent to Iraq, I don’t want to 
make that mistake, and people back 
home will not like it if I make that 
mistake. If I vote to go to war and the 
information is wrong and the strategy 
is wrong, well, then, people back home 
won’t like that either. 
So let’s just ignore the Constitution. 
Let’s just ignore our oath to the Con-
stitution. Let’s just let the person 
down Pennsylvania Avenue do what he 
wants because we don’t like the burden 
imposed on us by this document that 
says that issue has to be debated here. 
The decision to use force has to be 
debated and decided here, not there, be-
cause it is too big a question to leave 
to a single individual. 
Our Constitution starts out with 
these words: ‘‘We the people.’’ They did 
not want to create a King. They did not 
want to create an imperial Presidency 
that acted like a King. They wanted a 
nation run of, by, and for the people. 
The question of war is our responsi-
bility. We must make the decision 
here, and that is why I urge my col-
leagues to take and say yes, we will 
vote for this S.J. Res. 68 because it 
says we are demanding the administra-
tion do what the Constitution de-
mands, which is to place the question 
of going to war with Iran with this 
body.

kota. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the only first- 
degree amendments in order to S. J. 
Res. 68 be the following: 1301, 1322, 1305, 
1314, 1320, and 1319; I further ask that 
no second-degree amendments be in 
order to the amendments listed, with 
the exception of amendment No. 1319; 
that the Senate vote in relation to the 
amendments in the order listed at 10:30 
a.m. tomorrow; and that there be 2 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to each vote. Further, I ask unan-
imous consent that all debate time on 
S.J. Res. 68 expire at 1:45 p.m. tomor-
row, with the last 40 minutes, equally 
divided, under the control of Senators 
RISCH, INHOFE, MENENDEZ, and KAINE; 
and finally, that upon use or yielding 
back of that time, the joint resolution 
be read a third time and the Senate 
vote on passage of the joint resolution, 
as amended, if amended, with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NOS. 1301, 1322, 1305, 1314, 1320, AND 
1319, EN BLOC 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the amend-
ments listed be called up by number en 
bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the amend-
ments by number, en bloc. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. 
CRAMER], 
for 
other 
Senators, 
proposes 
amendments numbered 1301, 1322, 1305, 1314, 
1320, and 1319. 
The amendments are as follows: 
AMENDMENT NO. 1301 
(Purpose: To amend the findings) 
In section 1, insert after paragraph (3) the 
following: 
(4) Members of the United States Armed 
Forces and intelligence community, and all 
those involved in the planning of the Janu-
ary 2, 2020, strike on Qasem Soleimani, in-
cluding President Donald J. Trump, should 
be commended for their efforts in a success-
ful mission. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1322 
(Purpose: To amend the findings) 
On page 2, between lines 23 and 24, insert 
the following: 
(5) More than 100 members of the United 
States Armed Forces sustained traumatic 
brain injuries in the Iranian retaliatory at-
tack on the Ain al-Assad air base in Iraq de-
spite initial reports that no casualties were 
sustained in the attack. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1305 
(Purpose: To exempt from the termination 
requirement United States Armed Forces 
engaged in operations directed at des-
ignated terrorist organizations) 
On page 4, line 14, insert ‘‘except United 
States Armed Forces engaged in operations 
directed at entities designated as foreign ter-
rorist organizations under section 219 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1189),’’ after ‘‘or military,’’. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1314 
(Purpose: To amend the findings) 
On page 1, between lines 7 and 8, insert the 
following: 
(2) The President has a constitutional re-
sponsibility to take actions to defend the 
United States, its territories, possessions, 
citizens, service members, and diplomats 
from attack. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1320

In section 1, strike paragraph (6) and insert 
the following: 
(6) The United States Armed Forces are 
not currently engaged in hostilities, as con-
templated by the War Powers Resolution, 
against Iran. The United States strike 
against terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani to 
protect the lives of United States service 
members and diplomats is lesser in scope, 
nature, and duration than, and consistent 
with, previous administrations’ exercises of 
war powers. 
(7) The United States’ maximum pressure 
strategy against Iran has reduced the Gov-
ernment of Iran’s resources available to at-
tack the United States and United States in-
terests by limiting the resources available to 
the Government of Iran to support weapons 
development and terrorist proxies through-
out the region. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1319 
(Purpose: To amend the rule of construction) 
In section 2, amend subsection (b) to read 
as follows:

CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this section shall be construed— 
(1) to prevent the United States from de-
fending itself, including its territories, citi-
zens, troops, personnel, military bases, and 
diplomatic facilities from attack, including 
acting to prevent an attack; or 
(2) to restrict missions related to force pro-
tection of United States aircraft, ships, or 
personnel.

THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK 
AND PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since 
first emerging in Wuhan, China, on De-
cember 31, the outbreak of a new 
coronavirus, 
COVID–19, 
‘‘novel 
coronavirus’’, has spread to 25 coun-
tries, infected more than 44,000 people, 
caused at least 1,100 deaths, forced en-
tire cities into lockdown, triggered 
hundreds 
of 
international 
flight 
cancelations, restricted hundreds of 
Americans to U.S. military bases in 
Federal Government quarantine, and 
caused significant economic harm to 
countries and businesses around the 
globe, all this in only 6 weeks, with no 
end in sight. 
The virus has infected and killed 
more people and has done so faster

February 12, 2020 
than the SARS outbreak in China in 
the early 2000s, which infected 8,098 
people and caused 774 deaths world-
wide. The World Health Organization— 
WHO—has formally declared a public 
health emergency of international con-
cern—the sixth such declaration since 
2009—and the outbreak will get worse, 
possibly far worse, before it gets bet-
ter. 
While the novel coronavirus outbreak 
is alarming and is creating fear around 
the world, it should not be surprising. 
Scientists, 
epidemiologists, 
and 
other global health experts have for 
years warned that infectious disease 
outbreaks will continue to occur more 
frequently and cause greater harm, and 
that most emerging viruses will spread 
from 
animals 
to 
humans. 
Such 
zoonotic viruses are increasingly com-
mon as human activity, including pop-
ulation growth and expanding human 
encroachment into wildlife habitat, in-
creases contact between animals and 
humans, which is what happened in 
Wuhan. 
The coronavirus strain threatening 
us today is believed to have emerged 
from a bat, and potentially passed 
through another animal before infect-
ing humans in a live-animal market. 
Such animal markets, which in China 
and many other countries include bats, 
rats, birds, porcupines, and other ani-
mals infected with viruses, are sources 
of protein for hungry humans, but also 
serve as breeding grounds for zoonotic 
diseases. 
Scientists estimate that there are 
more than 1.6 million unknown viral 
disease species in mammalian and 
avian populations, of which an esti-
mated 600,000 to 850,000 have the poten-
tial to infect humans. As we saw dur-
ing SARS, Ebola, and MERS and are 
now seeing once again, infectious dis-
ease 
outbreaks 
threaten 
not 
only 
human health but also cause economic 
harm and social upheaval. 
We should all be asking whether we, 
the United States and the inter-
national community, are doing enough 
to combat and prepare for this known 
and escalating threat. It seems obvious 
that we are not. 
In fact, while the President and Sec-
retary of State have repeatedly said 
that protecting the health and safety 
of American citizens is their highest 
priority, that is not borne out by the 
facts. The American people should be 
aware that the Trump administration 
has consistently proposed cuts in fund-
ing for the very programs designed to 
help prevent outbreaks and contain the 
spread of infectious diseases like the 
novel coronavirus. Even in the Presi-
dent’s fiscal year 2021 budget request 
sent to Congress this week, in the 
midst of a deadly infectious disease 
outbreak that will almost certainly be-
come a global pandemic, the adminis-
tration has proposed to pay less than 
half of what the U.S. owes WHO, in ad-
dition to requesting a 10 percent cut to 
U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment—USAID—pandemic preparedness 
programs. It is a reckless game of Rus-
sian roulette with a global threat we 
absolutely must prepare for. Yester-
day, it was SARS, then it was Ebola; 
today, 
it 
is 
Ebola 
again 
and 
a 
coronavirus. Tomorrow, it may be 
something that is even deadlier and 
spreads even faster. Fortunately for 
the American people, Congress has re-
jected those cuts in the past and in-
creased funding for most global health 
programs, and I am confident we will 
do the same this year, but far more 
needs to be done. 
Funding for pandemic preparedness 
at the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, USAID, National Insti-
tutes of Health, Department of Health 
and Human Services, and other Federal 
agencies that play an indispensable 
role in preparing for and responding to 
outbreaks should be significantly in-
creased, not forced to cut programs and 
personnel as the administration has 
proposed. It makes no sense to be 
shortchanging the agencies and pro-
grams we all depend on to protect pub-
lic health, keep our ports of entry 
open, and keep our commerce flowing. 
Pandemic response is critical, but 
often, by then, it is too late. We can 
and must do more to proactively re-
duce pandemic risk. One approach I 
have urged is for a global viral dis-
covery effort. Such a concept was prov-
en successful through USAID’s PRE-
DICT program, which used the collec-
tion and analysis of wildlife samples in 
areas of the world most at risk for 
zoonotic disease to identify new emerg-
ing viruses with pandemic potential. 
PREDICT was able to discover hun-
dreds of disease pathogens at their 
source, rather than waiting for human 
infection. 
In China, the PREDICT program 
sampled more than 10,000 bats and 
identified 
more 
than 
500 
new 
coronaviruses, including a strain that 
is a 96 percent match to the 2019 novel 
coronavirus strain. The known exist-
ence of and readily available data on 
such a close relative is one reason 
China was able to quickly sequence the 
novel strain and identify the animal 
source of the outbreak. 
As the 10-year PREDICT program 
comes to an end this year, USAID is 
working to design the next phase of 
programming to build on the successful 
analytical and modeling work dem-
onstrated through PREDICT. Others in 
the international community should 
use the lessons learned and techniques 
proven through PREDICT to inform 
their own efforts. 
Investing in biomedical research fo-
cused on infectious disease is another 
crucial, proactive step to reducing pan-
demic risk. The NIH’s National Insti-
tute of Allergy and Infectious Dis-
eases—NIAID—has a unique mandate 
to conduct and support basic and ap-
plied research on established infectious 
diseases and also to quickly launch a 
research response to newly emerging 
and 
reemerging 
infectious 
threats. 
With NIAID support, scientists design 
and develop new diagnostics, treat-
ments, and preventive strategies, in-
cluding vaccines, which can be de-
ployed to protect and treat people 
worldwide. 
Yet, in the midst of the novel 
coronavirus emergency, the President’s 
budget would cut $3.1 billion from NIH 
and assumes the reduction is spread 
across-the-board to all 27 Institutes 
and Centers, including NIAID. Slashing 
infectious disease research programs 
threatens our ability to develop better 
therapeutics and vaccines for high pri-
ority pathogens, as well as the rapid 
development 
of 
medical 
counter-
measures against emerging infectious 
diseases, like the coronavirus, when 
they arise. 
The President’s budget features simi-
lar dangerous cuts to CDC programs 
that have been pivotal in combating 
the novel coronavirus response, pro-
posing a $693 million overall decrease 
from fiscal year 2020. Although the ad-
ministration touts its $175 million pro-
posal for Global Health Security in fis-
cal year 2021, it simultaneously cuts al-
most $100 million from other crucial 
global health investments, including in 
global HIV/AIDS, global polio eradi-
cation, global immunization, and the 
global public health capacity and de-
velopment programs. This is short- 
sighted and dangerous. 
The President’s budget proposes only 
$50 million, a $35 million decrease com-
pared to fiscal year 2020, for CDC’s In-
fectious Disease Rapid Response Re-
serve 
Fund—IDRRRF—which 
has 
served as the primary source of funding 
for responding to the novel coronavirus 
outbreak. This risks potentially under-
mining the agency’s ability to access 
funding to initiate an early and rapid 
response to emerging pandemic threats 
like novel coronavirus when the U.S. is 
faced with a public health emergency. 
The administration also proposes an 
$85 million cut to the CDC’s Center on 
Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Dis-
ease and a $25 million cut to the Public 
Health Preparedness and Response Pro-
gram. 
Slashing these programs weakens 
CDC’s ability to provide rapid sci-
entific support during outbreaks of in-
fectious disease, maintain support for 
global health programs that build core 
public health capabilities and bolster 
frontline preparedness internationally, 
and ensure that State and local health 
departments are ready to handle many 
different types of emergencies that 
threaten the health and resilience of 
families, communities, and the Nation, 
Thus, while the White House named its 
fiscal year 2021 budget A Budget for 
America’s Future, it is anything but 
that. There is no better example of 
where this Administration’s rhetoric 
clashes with reality than the drastic 
cuts they propose to the very programs 
that protect the American people from 
deadly communicative diseases. 
I continue to urge USAID, other Fed-
eral agencies, the White House, and 
Members of Congress to support a more

proactive approach to reducing pan-
demic risk. Today, we are struggling to 
control outbreaks of Ebola and the 
novel coronavirus, and while we don’t 
know which viruses will next attack 
us, we do know it is not a matter of it: 
but when, and we must do everything 
we can to prepare. The more informa-
tion we have about potential zoonotic 
viruses, the better able we will be to 
respond. The stakes are immense. 
Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds 
of thousands, even millions of lives 
could be lost, and the amount of fund-

calculable.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE 2020 ARKANSAS 
BUSINESS HALL OF FAME HON-
OREES 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the newest members 
of the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame. 
Arkansas native Olivia Farrell is a 
shining example of what a lifetime of 
hard work and devotion looks like. 
After graduating from the University 
of Arkansas at Little Rock in 1978, she 
joined the Arkansas Writers Project, 
selling ads for the Arkansas Times. 
Shortly after, the Writers Project also 
created Arkansas Business, which was 
later purchased by Farrell and became 
the 
Arkansas 
Business 
Publishing 
Group, where she served as CEO. 
Not only did Farrell find personal 
success in business, but she also sought 
to help bring more women into the 
business community. As such, Farrell 
created and promoted an annual maga-
zine highlighting the top 100 women in 
Arkansas. This list encouraged compa-
nies and their stakeholders to bring 
more women into their ranks. Further-
more, she created the Women’s Foun-
dation of Arkansas to promote in-
creased investment in women’s edu-
cation, business opportunities, and phi-
lanthropy. 
Some of her most notable awards in-
clude being inducted in the Arkansas 
Women’s Hall of Fame, as well as being 
the recipient of the Business and Pro-
fessional Leader of the Year award by 
the Rotary Club of Little Rock. Her 
leadership and kindness have been the 
subject of much deserved praise. 
Reynie 
Rutledge 
was 
born 
in 
Smackover, AR. Growing up in a small 
Arkansas town taught him the value of 
hard work and doing the right thing. 
He earned an undergraduate degree in 
industrial engineering from the Univer-
sity of Arkansas prior to earning his 
MBA in 1973. Upon leaving school, he 
was hired as a loan officer at Worthen 
Bank in Little Rock. A few years later, 
Rutledge took a gamble in purchasing 
First Security Bank, which at the time 
had only three branches and $46 million 
in assets. Under his leadership, the 
small Searcy, AR, bank grew into a $5.9 
billion dollar holding company with 
over 77 locations across 17 counties and 
34 communities, with more than 1,000 
employees across the State. 
Rutledge has always given back to 
the Natural State. He has been an ac-
tive member of Searcy’s First United 
Methodist Church since 1977 and also 
serves on the Searcy Water Board. Rut-
ledge has also served as a member of 
the University of Arkansas Board of 
Trustees, chairman of the selection 
committee of the Arkansas Business 
Hall of Fame, and chairman of the Ar-
kansas Bankers Association. Some of 
the many accolades he has received 
over his career include the University 
of Arkansas 2000 Volunteer of the Year, 
2012 University of Arkansas Distin-
guished Alumni Award, and 2011 Life-
time Achievement Award from the 
Walton College of Business. 
Gerald B. Alley was born in Pine 
Bluff, 
AR. 
As 
the 
son 
of 
a 
businessowner, he saw firsthand the 
hard work and commitment required to 
produce a thriving business that maxi-
mizes a person’s ability to give back to 
their community. After finishing his 
education and working for his father, 
Alley enrolled at the University of Ar-
kansas at the age of 16, majoring in fi-
nance. After graduating from the Uni-
versity of Arkansas, he continued his 
education at Southern Methodist Uni-
versity, where he earned his MBA. 
Along with the help of his brother, 
Troy, Jr., he started Con-Real. Under 
his leadership, Con-Real built the larg-
est parking garage in Texas. Addition-
ally, the company helped build schools, 
stores, and other facilities that pro-
vided 
entertainment 
and 
essential 
services to the community. As Alley 
gained more experience as a business 
leader, he expanded Con-Real’s services 
and launched another firm focused on 
medical 
construction 
which 
rep-
resented the largest medical system in 
the U.S. Today, Con-Real offers a mul-
titude of services ranging from real es-
tate to technology and innovation 
while consistently promoting minority 
firms. 
Aside from his business ventures, 
Alley serves on the executive advisory 
board at the Walton College of Busi-
ness at the University of Arkansas. Ad-
ditionally, he is on the advisory board 
at the Cox School of Business at South-
ern Methodist University and is also a 
member of the board of trustees at the 
school. After years of business and 
philanthropic success, he has proven to 
be a role model for anybody who values 
dedication, hard work and persever-
ance. 
Charles Nabholz was born near Squir-
rel Hill, AR. Hailing from a farming 
family, he was instilled with a strong 
work ethic that served him well. 
Though the family business began in 
1949, he began his career with Nabholz 
Construction after graduating from 
Conway’s St. Joseph High School in 
1954. 
He began his career with the com-
pany as a laborer. Eventually, Nabholz 
founded and managed Con-Ark build-
ers, a company that would later merge 
with Nabholz Construction. After a 
brief stint out of the State, he returned 
to serve as Governor Frank White’s di-
rector of State Building Services. He 
continued to serve as a valuable asset 
outside of the State government, help-
ing to create Nabholz Properties and 
serving as chairman of the board for 
the Nabholz Group in 2000. In 2014, he 
was 
named 
chairman 
emeritus 
of 
Nabholz Group. 
Charles Nabholz is an extremely in-
volved member of his community. Not 
only is he a member of the several Ar-
kansas trade associations, but he ac-
tively participates in or has previously 
contributed his time to several groups 
such as the Conway Regional Medical 
Center Foundation, the Conway Cham-
ber of Commerce, and the Arkansas Re-
search Alliance. Among the many hon-
ors he has received are an award for 
Leadership in Free Enterprise and the 
Distinguished Citizen Award. 
I congratulate each of these honorees 
for their valuable contributions to Ar-
kansas and the industries they rep-
resent. Our State is certainly better off 
because of the work each has done to 
advance their own careers, as well as 
the companies they have led. This 
honor is a fitting way to acknowledge 
them and memorialize their legacies in 
the Natural State’s business commu-
nity.∑

TRIBUTE TO JIM BYRUM 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Jim Byrum’s 
term of service as president of the 
Michigan Agri-Business Association, as 
well as his contributions to Michigan’s 
agriculture industry as a whole. 
Jim was born and raised in Onon-
daga, MI, the fourth generation of his 
family to live on the family farm. He 
maintained his passion for agriculture 
by spending his career advocating for 
individuals in the industry and the in-
dustry itself, first as the executive di-
rector of the Michigan Bean Commis-
sion, then as the State executive direc-
tor of the Michigan Farm Service 
Agency, and finally as the president of 
the Michigan Agri-Business Associa-
tion. 
Founded in 1903, the Michigan Agri- 
Business Association supports Michi-
gan agriculture through State and na-
tional education, promotion, and advo-
cacy. During his 24 years as president, 
Mr. Byrum has guided the association 
and its members through expansive 
changes in environmental awareness, 
agricultural genetics, and economic 
factors. With his past experience and in

his role as head of the Michigan Agri- 
Business Association, Mr. Byrum so-
lidified his reputation as a well-re-
spected leader in agricultural policy 
and, through the association, rep-
resented and championed the needs of 
the over 500 member organizations 
from 
every 
agricultural 
sector 
in 
Michigan. He expertly communicated 
with lawmakers and stakeholders to 
ensure that Michigan remained a lead-
er in agriculture, the State’s second 
largest industry. 
It is my honor to congratulate my 
friend Jim Byrum for his decades of 
service to Michiganders, especially in 
his outgoing role as president of the 
Michigan Agri-Business Association. 
As the association reflects on the end 
of Mr. Byrum’s term as President, I 
ask my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating him for his tireless dedica-
tion to Michigan’s hard-working agri-
cultural workers and all of us who de-
pend on the goods and services they 
provide.∑

RECOGNIZING THE YESCO 
CENTENNIAL 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I com-
mend youth team sports in general, 
and the sponsors of my youth football 
team in particular. For those that may 
not know, I love football. I played it, 
coached it, and now watch my sons 
learn the same valuable lessons I did 
many years ago. Youth sports teach 
important life lessons and help build 
pride and a sense of community within 
schools, neighborhoods, and even cit-
ies. I learned those lifelong lessons 
growing up in Las Vegas, where I 
played for a youth football team called 
the Cavaliers. My dad even volunteered 
as the team’s equipment manager. 
As a former member of the Cavaliers 
youth football team, I am honored to 
recognize a special milestone of the 
sponsor of my team, the Young Elec-
tric Sign Company—YESCO. In 2020, 
YESCO celebrates its 100th year; a cen-
tennial event is scheduled February 20, 
2020, in Salt Lake City, UT, the com-
pany’s home base. 
In many ways, the story of YESCO is 
the story of America: innovation, in-
vention, a restlessness to move beyond 
the status quo, and commitment to 
others. The history of YESCO reso-
nates with me, the son of an immi-
grant. YESCO was founded in 1920 by 
an immigrant from Liverpool named 
Tom Young, who borrowed $300. By the 
end of that decade, he had 27 fulltime 
employees. By 1932, YESCO was build-
ing signs in Las Vegas, which is now a 
showcase of YESCO signage. 
Today, YESCO is creating hundreds 
of signs for the new football stadium in 
Las Vegas, the Raiders’ $2 billion Alle-
giant Stadium. The largest video board 
will be 180 feet on the front of the sta-
dium, facing Interstate 15 and Dean 
Martin Drive, not far from where my 
team the Cavaliers played youth foot-
ball. As a Floridian, I note that YESCO 
contracted with Disney World in the 
1980s to create sophisticated, high-tech 
signs at EPCOT Center. 
The 2028 Summer Olympics will be 
hosted by Los Angeles. Men and wom-
en’s soccer matches will be played at 
the new, state-of-the-art Banc of Cali-
fornia Stadium, which will feature a 
high-tech LED digital sign built by a 
U.S. company called YESCO. Many of 
those athletes got their start because 
of volunteer coaches, dedicated par-
ents, and corporate sponsors that un-
derstood the meaning of community. 
As a parent and as a former football 
player, I salute the men and women 
who volunteer to coach youth sports 
and the corporate sponsors who help 
put kids on the field. 
Congratulations, 
YESCO, 
on 
100 
years of growth and leadership. Thank 
you for your community involvement 
and for putting a football jersey on a 
skinny kid in Las Vegas who someday 
would be elected to the U.S. Senate.∑

February 12, 2020 
Whereas, The Rangers were highly and rig-
orously trained to attack in the dead of 
night from the least likely route and climb 
cliffs and speed march, enabling them to in-
filtrate deep behind enemy lines on foot; and 
Whereas, There were six Ranger Battalions 
deployed during World War II, all of which 
were strictly volunteer; and Whereas, Each 
battalion was comprised of approximately 
500 men; and 
Whereas, At least 48 World War II Rangers 
came from this Commonwealth, 33 of which 
remained overseas in American battlefield 
cemeteries; and 
Whereas, Three World War II Rangers in D 
Company, 2nd Ranger Battalion were from 
Altoona; and 
Whereas, Two of the three climbed the 
cliffs at Pointe du Hoc and one destroyed 
five of six long-range artillery pieces at 
Pointe du Hoc; and 
Whereas, There are only 41 known World 
War II Rangers alive nationwide; and 
Whereas, It is imperative that these heroes 
are given the honor they deserve; therefore 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives urge the President and the Congress of 
the United States to enact S. 1757 or similar 
legislation to award the Congressional Gold 
Medal, collectively, to the United States 
Army Rangers Veterans of World War II in 
recognition of their extraordinary service; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, to the presiding officers of each 
house of Congress and to each member of 
Congress from Pennsylvania. 
POM–181. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress 
and the President of the United States to in-
crease funding for the Great Lakes restora-
tion initiative to $475 million per year; to 
the Committee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 157 
Whereas, The Great Lakes are a critical re-
source for our nation and central to the 
economy, heritage, and quality of life of 
Michigan and the other seven states within 
the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes 
hold over 84 percent of the United States’ 
surface freshwater and drive a thriving re-
gional economy, directly supporting 1.5 mil-
lion U.S. jobs and generating $62 billion in 
wages. More than 30 million U.S. residents 
depend on the Great Lakes for drinking 
water: and 
Whereas, The Great Likes Restoration Ini-
tiative (GLRI) has provided crucial funding 
to support long overdue work to protect and 
restore the Great Lakes. In partnership with 
the states, local governments, and other or-
ganizations, the federal government has in-
vested more than $3 billion and supported 
over 4,700 projects over the last decade, in-
cluding around $600 million for more than 
1,100 projects in Michigan: and 
Whereas, The Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative represents a sound investment in 
both the environment and the economies of 
the Great Lakes region. A 2018 study cal-
culated that for every federal dollar invested 
in Great Lakes restoration there is $3.35 in 
additional economic activity, with older in-
dustrial cities like Detroit seeing an even 
higher return on investment; and 
Whereas, Real progress has been made in 
cleaning up and restoring the Great Lakes 
thanks to the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative. One-third of the region’s toxic hot 
spots have been cleaned up, sparking rede-
velopment and business opportunities on wa-
terfronts. Area farms and conservation orga-
nizations have increased conservation prac-
tices, which have reduced harmful nutrient 
runoff, and habitat and wildlife connectivity 
continue to improve, with nearly 5,000 miles 
of rivers cleared of dams and other barriers: 
and 
Whereas, Far more work needs to be done 
to ensure every person has a clean commu-
nity in which to live, safe beaches to enjoy, 
and healthy fish to eat. Substantial limita-
tions and threats to the use of the Great 
Lakes remain whether toxic algal blooms 
shutting down Toledo’s drinking water sup-
ply, invasive carp threatening billion-dollar 
fisheries, or contaminated sediments re-
stricting recreational opportunities: and 
Whereas, The time to act is now. The eco-
logical, economic, and health risks are too 
high. The problems will only get worse and 
the solutions more expensive and chal-
lenging in the future; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we memorialize the President and Con-
gress of the United States to increase fund-
ing for the Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive to $475 million per year to boost the re-
gion’s work of cleaning up toxic contamina-
tion, reducing runoff pollution, stopping 
invasive species, and protecting and restor-
ing wetlands and other habitats; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, and the members 
of the Michigan congressional delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. 
JOHNSON, Mr. PERDUE, and Mr. 
LANKFORD): 
S. 3287. A bill to modify the govern-
mentwide financial management plan, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to in-
troduce the Chief Financial Officer Vi-
sion Act of 2020, shortened to be the 
CFO Vision Act of 2020. I am pleased to 
have 
Senators 
WARNER, 
GRASSLEY, 
JOHNSON, LANKFORD, and PERDUE join 
me as cosponsors of this bill to 
strengthen Federal financial manage-
ment and improve financial and per-
formance data. 
Improved 
financial 
management— 
this is numbers; I know this puts peo-
ple to sleep—improved financial man-
agement and better data can help us 
make more informed budget decisions 
and ensure that taxpayer money is 
wisely and appropriately spent. Effec-
tive financial management helps to 
safeguard taxpayer money and ensure 
that it is used lawfully, efficiently, and 
effectively for the purposes intended. 
Thirty years ago, Congress passed 
the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, 
known as the CFO Act. This law laid a 
new foundation for Federal financial 
management. It established a financial 
management leadership structure, pro-
vided for long-range planning, required 
audited 
financial 
statements, 
and 
strengthened accountability reporting, 
among other reforms. The CFO Act 
also called for improvements in the in-
tegration of agency accounting and fi-
nancial management systems, in per-
formance measurement and cost infor-
mation, and in our financial manage-
ment workforce. 
Since enactment of that act, we have 
seen substantial improvements in Fed-
eral 
financial 
management. 
Today, 
agencies have CFOs in place to provide 
leadership and accountability over fi-
nancial operations, and most agencies 
receive clean audit opinions on their 
annual financial statements. However, 
serious and persistent problems re-
main. 
Many agencies have struggled to 
modernize legacy accounting systems 
and are unable to integrate their finan-
cial and performance data. Oftentimes, 
the Federal Government is unable to 
show the relationship between dollars 
spent and results achieved. After more 
than 20 years of trying, the Govern-
ment Accountability Office still cannot 
give an opinion on the Federal Govern-
ment’s consolidated financial state-
ments. They cite serious financial 
management problems at the Depart-
ment of Defense, among other issues. 
The legislation we are introducing 
would update that 1990 law in a handful 
of 
key 
ways 
to 
ensure 
sustained 
progress in improving Federal financial 
management. It is based in large part 
on a GAO—Government Accountability 
Office—review of the 1990 law and testi-
mony last October from the Comp-
troller General of the United States, 
Gene Dodaro, before the Senate Budget 
Committee. 
First, the CFO Vision Act would 
standardize CFO and Deputy Chief Fi-
nancial Officer responsibilities, which 
do vary across Federal agencies. To 
allow for better strategic decision 
making, the Chief Financial Officer Vi-
sion Act would specify that the Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
responsibilities 
should include budget formulation and 
execution, planning and performance, 
risk management and internal con-
trols, financial systems, and account-
ing. 
The bill would also ensure that the 
Deputy Chief Financial Officers could 
provide continuity in the event of a 
Chief Financial Officer vacancy. Major 
financial 
management 
improvement 
initiatives can take years to imple-
ment, potentially outlasting the CFO’s 
tenure. By establishing appropriate 
statutory responsibilities for the Dep-
uty Chief Financial Officers, the bill 
would help minimize the effects of the 
CFO turnover. 
Secondly, the bill would update the 
governmentwide and agency-level plan-
ning requirements to ensure they are 
reasonable and allow for proper plan-
ning and monitoring. The updated 
plans would include projected mile-
stones and estimated implementation 
costs. Annual status updates would 
allow Congress to track progress to-
ward these milestones and how closely 
actual costs match those that were 
projected. 
Third, the CFO Vision Act would re-
quire the Office of Management and 
Budget to develop performance-based 
metrics to determine the status and 
progress of agencies and how they are 
making 
progress 
toward 
achieving 
cost-effective and efficient government 
operations. 
Currently, 
only 
limited 
financial 
management 
performance-based 
metrics exist, such as the financial 
statement audit opinion and reporting 
of identified material weaknesses. All 
accountants understand these terms. 
Currently, 
only 
limited 
financial 
management 
performance-based 
metrics exist, such as the financial 
statement audit opinion and the re-
porting of identified material weak-
nesses. I could say that a third time, 
and still people wouldn’t understand it. 
This new requirement would provide 
a more complete and consistent meas-
urement of the quality of the agencies’ 
financial management. These perform-
ance metrics would be required to be 
included in the governmentwide and 
agency-level 
financial 
management 
plans and status reports. That means 
we will have more information to work 
with. 
Finally, our bill would require agen-
cy management to annually assess and 
report on the effectiveness of internal 
control—whether they are really keep-
ing track of everything and ensuring 
that it is correct—the effectiveness of 
internal control over financial report-
ing and other key financial manage-
ment information. Auditors would also 
be required to independently assess in-
ternal controls. Such assessments will 
improve confidence in the reliability of 
financial reporting. 
The CFO Vision Act builds on the 
CFO Act’s foundation. By updating it, 
we can achieve more effective financial 
management, which I believe will ulti-
mately lead to increased account-
ability and results and understanding 
by the Senators. 
I am pleased that our bill has been 
endorsed by the National Taxpayers 
Union, the Project on Government 
Oversight, the DATA Coalition, the R 
Street Institute, Citizens Against Gov-
ernment Waste, Truth in Accounting, 
and Taxpayers for Common Sense. I 
think that means that there are ac-
countants on the boards of all of those. 
This shouldn’t be a controversial piece 
of legislation. It just should be an es-
sential update so we know what is hap-
pening with the trillions of dollars that

TRIBUTE TO COMMEMORATE CITI-
ZENS NATIONAL BANK’S 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commemorate the 100th anni-
versary of Citizens National Bank in southern 
Kentucky, an incredible milestone for a small 
business in rural America. 
The first Citizens National Bank opened on 
Valentine’s Day in 1920 in Somerset, Ken-
tucky’s public square. Over the last 100 years, 
this community bank has been recognized as 
a local leader, affording individuals and fami-
lies the opportunity to achieve home owner-
ship, loaning seed funds for entrepreneurial 
dreamers to start their own businesses, and 
providing a safe and secure way for families to 
grow their savings and retirement accounts. 
Persevering through changes in technology, 
the bank converted to its first computer sys-
tem in 1986, added full service automated tell-
er machines (ATMs) in the 1990’s, and ven-
tured into mobile banking in 2011. Citizens 
National Bank was first granted trust powers in 
1999 and was listed as a 5 Star Bank by the 
Bauer Financial Group in the same year, pro-
viding new opportunities for growth and 
progress. 
Today, the bank’s slogan is, ‘‘Moving For-
ward Together’’ and it is an honor to join the 
countless residents in our region in recognition 
of Citizens National Bank’s centennial year of 
service spanning four counties. Congratula-
tions to the long line of leaders who estab-
lished and guided this community bank over 
the years, providing financial security and 
hope for local families.

THE 
SMALL 
BUSINESS 
SIZE 
STANDARD 
MANUFACTURING 
CLARIFICATION ACT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
our Nation’s small business manufacturers 
have an invaluable impact on our economy. 
This past October, I introduced H.R. 4702, 
the Small Business Size Standard Manufac-
turing Clarification Act of 2019. This legislation 
will help thousands of defense and national 
security small businesses compete against 
much larger corporations when applying for 
federal contracts. It is near impossible for 
these small defense businesses to plan and 
secure larger contracts on a 12-month basis. 
This legislation expands the time from 12 
months to up to 60 months. Defense-related 
small business manufacturers need that extra 
time to justify their small business designation 
due to changes in technology and competition 
from much larger corporate contracts. Size 
standards for both revenue-based and em-
ployee-based small business manufacturers 
are not at a level that recognizes the changes 
in the current marketplace for defining small 
businesses that support the federal sector. 
Recently, the House passed H.R. 5130, the 
Capturing All Small Businesses Act, which 
raises the standard to a 24-month basis. Still, 
it is not enough to properly support our small 
business manufacturers in the national secu-
rity sector. In the defense industry, a small 
business that grows to over 1,600 employees 
has to compete in a market with companies of 
more than 25,000 employees. 
I am committed to supporting our Nation’s 
small businesses and fixing the issues ad-
dressed in the Small Business Standard Man-
ufacturing Clarification Act. I urge the House 
to consider this legislation and join me in sup-
porting our small business manufacturers.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BAKU POGROMS 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to condemn the violence inflicted 
upon Armenians on the 30th anniversary of 
the Baku Pogroms in Azerbaijan. I believe that 
condemning these actions today will help pre-
vent renewed aggression against citizens of 
Armenian descent who continue to live in 
Azerbaijan, while bringing attention to efforts 
to erase these atrocities from our collective 
memory. Further, I reaffirm our nation’s com-
mitment to an enduring, peaceful, and demo-
cratic resolution of the Artsakh conflict. 
From 1988 to 1990, the Armenian popu-
lation in Soviet Azerbaijan was the target of 
ethnically targeted pogroms in the cities of 
Sumgait, Kirovabad, and Baku. Beginning on 
February 27, 1988 in Sumgait, Armenian 
Christians were indiscriminately murdered, 
raped, and maimed by mobs of criminals and 
thugs. According to independent reporting, po-
lice in Baku allowed the pogroms to continue 
for 3 days, during which time hundreds are es-
timated to have been murdered in cold blood. 
Despite vocal U.S. and international protests 
over the Sumgait pogroms, renewed anti-Ar-
menian pogroms were launched in Kirovabad 
on November 21, 1988 that lasted for seven 
days. Fourteen months later in the capital, 
Baku, another pogrom was launched against 
its Armenian minority. These vicious attacks 
against unarmed civilians led to the displace-
ment of thousands of Armenian families flee-
ing systematic violence as refugees. 
Madam Speaker, on this 30th anniversary of 
the Baku pogroms, I want to emphasize the 
importance of remembering these crimes 
against humanity. I call on the Azerbaijani 
government to acknowledge that these atroc-
ities occurred, and that it seeks justice for the 
victims by prosecuting those who committed 
these horrific acts of violence. I also call upon 
the government of Azerbaijan to take all ap-
propriate action to prevent further tragedies of 
this nature, and to do whatever is necessary 
to begin the healing process for the families of 
the victims. I call on the Azerbaijani govern-
ment to respect the rights of all minorities liv-
ing within its borders. 
f 
ANNIVERSARY OF ANTI-ARMENIAN 
POGROMS IN AZERBAIJAN 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, this year we 
honor the memory of hundreds of ethnic Ar-
menians killed—and hundreds of thousands 
displaced—between 1988 and 1990 in brutal 
and violent pogroms in Azerbaijan. In the 
1980s, citizens in Azerbaijan of Armenian her-
itage embarked on one of the first pro-democ-
racy movements against the Soviet Empire, 
calling for self-determination, fair treatment, 
and an end to discrimination. This pro-democ-
racy movement was met with extreme brutality 
in waves of pogroms and forced deportations 
of Armenians from Azerbaijan. Mobs violently 
attacked ethnic Armenians in the cities of 
Sumgait in late February 1988, Kirovabad in 
November 1988, and the capital, Baku, in Jan-
uary 1990. 
For three days in February 1988, mobs mur-
dered, raped, assaulted, and burned alive eth-
nic Armenians. This came as the result of 
years and decades of anti-Armenian rhetoric 
and policies engineered by the Azerbaijani 
government, contributing to a lethal climate of 
dehumanization, racism, and religious intoler-
ance. 
Despite an international outcry, including bi-
partisan resolutions, statements and letters 
from concerned members of Congress, the vi-
olence continued. Between 1988 and 1990, 
according to human rights organizations, an 
estimated 300,000 to 350,000 Armenians fled 
Azerbaijan under threat of violence or were 
deported. The failure of the government to le-
gitimately address simple democratic de-
mands, and the violent response to largely 
peaceful movements, fueled a spiral of reac-
tionary intercommunal violence and prolonged 
armed conflict in the region. Today, I stand to 
remember and honor all of those killed, 
wounded and displaced in these anti-Arme-
nian pogroms. 
The lessons of the events of 1988 to 1990 
are obviously acutely relevant as we look 
around the world today. Ethnic and religious 
hatred that foments violence is on the rise— 
the Rohingya in Burma have been slaugh-
tered, Uighur Muslims in China are being put 
in concentration camps because of their reli-
gion, and tens of thousands of Jehovah’s Wit-
nesses have been declared extremists in Rus-
sia for following their peaceful religion.

When human beings are denied their uni-
versal freedoms, and when governments put 
in place dehumanizing rhetoric, policies, and 
laws; then hatred, violence, and suffering fol-
low. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in 
recognition of the plight suffered by ethnic Ar-
menians thirty years ago and to stand vigilant 
against the use of ethnic and religious hatred 
to stir violence against minorities here in the 
United States and around the world.

RECOGNIZING MR. RANDY ROUTON 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize my friend, Mr. Randy Routon for 
his nearly thirty-four years of dedicated service 
in mental health as the Chief Executive Officer 
of LifePath Systems, a mental healthcare pro-
vider in Collin County. 
Randy’s steadfast leadership helped thou-
sands of families and individuals throughout 
our community gain access to life changing 
mental healthcare. Randy’s inspiring dedica-
tion was also illustrated by his role on many 
boards, committees, task forces, and clubs 
throughout our community. 
I proudly worked with him during my time in 
the state legislatures towards our shared goal 
of ensuring everyone in Collin County has a 
chance to receive high quality of mental 
healthcare. 
I know Randy looks forward to spending 
more time with his wife, Diane, as well as their 
six children and six grandchildren during his 
retirement. 
As Randy prepares to begin his next chap-
ter, I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in thank-
ing Randy Routon for his selfless and dedi-
cated career of serving those around him.

CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and sincere admiration that I rise 
today to celebrate Black History Month and its 
2020 theme—African Americans and the Vote. 
2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the ratifi-
cation of the 19th Amendment. This year’s 
theme reflects on the extraordinary contribu-
tions of African Americans throughout the his-
tory of our democracy as we reflect on the on-
going efforts to ensure equality for all Ameri-
cans. As we reflect on the past, this year’s 
theme focuses on the fight to ensure that Afri-
can American voices and votes mattered in 
America. 
The year 2020 commemorates the 115th 
anniversary of the 15th Amendment, which 
granted African American men the right to 
vote. When the amendment was first intro-
duced, it did not mention black men. After the 
conclusion of the civil war, however, aboli-
tionist Frederick Douglas spoke before the 
Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society advo-
cating for the right for black men to vote. 
While the debate continued, in 1869, 150 Afri-
can American men from seventeen states 
gathered for the first national meeting of Afri-
can Americans in the history of the United 
States. 
The year 2020 also marks the 100th anni-
versary of the ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment. During this time, the Women’s Rights 
Movement was intertwined with the Antislavery 
Movement. African American women played a 
prominent role in the movement by organizing, 
attending, and speaking out at political and re-
ligious events, thus leading to the ratification 
of the 19th Amendment. We honor these 
brave and dedicated women who contributed 
to the foundation of African American liberty 
including Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, 
Maria W. Stewart, Henrietta Purvis, Harriet 
Forten Purvis, and Sarah Redmon, among 
many others. As we pay tribute to these he-
roes of American history, let us remember 
their profound perseverance, sacrifice, and 
struggle in the fight for freedom and equality 
and the remarkable impact their contributions 
have had in shaping our great nation. This 
month and always, it is important that we 
honor and celebrate America’s greatest advo-
cates for equal rights and civil liberties. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my dis-
tinguished colleagues join me in celebrating 
Black History Month and honoring those who 
fought, and continue to fight, for civil rights 
and justice. We honor the African American 
men and women who have played such a cru-
cial role in changing the landscape of Amer-
ican society for the better.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
PAULDING COUNTY’S 200TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Bicentennial of Paulding County, 
Ohio, the last frontier to be settled in our great 
state. Our country was founded because of 
the brave pioneers who ventured into the 
Great Outdoors in order to create a better life 
for future settlers. 
In 1819, Captain James Riley and his sur-
veyors trudged through the mosquito infested 
Great Black Swamp to lay out the township 
lines for what would later become Paulding 
County. 
The Great Black Swamp covered more than 
1,500 square miles. It was created more than 
10,000 years ago after the glaciers receded 
and formed the Great Lakes. From the sur-
veyor’s notes, we know that the Ottawa and 
Shawnee Indian tribes inhabited this land of 
deciduous swamp forest. The giant oaks, hick-
ory, elm, ash, and many other large tree spe-
cies created a dense canopy, which blocked 
sunlight from reaching the forest floor. The 
dense forest and mucky conditions made set-
tlement of the area extremely difficult as 
Paulding County, in its entirety, laid beneath 
the swamp. The landscape required drastic al-
terations before settlers were able to make 
Paulding County into the flat, agriculturally rich 
region that it is today. 
In 1820, this area was named Paulding 
County in honor of John Paulding, an Amer-
ican hero during the American Revolution who 
aided in the capture of Major John Andre, a 
British spy who was the co-conspirator of 
Benedict Arnold. 
The celebration of the 200th Anniversary of 
Paulding County reminds our community of 
the determination and pioneering attitude upon 
which counties throughout Ohio and our coun-
try were founded. Congratulations to Paulding 
County on this significant milestone.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BAKU POGROMS 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in recognition of the 30th anniversary of the 
Baku Pogroms against Christian Armenians 
that took place from 1988 to 1990. In February 
1988, the Armenian population in Soviet-con-
trolled Azerbaijan became the victim of racially 
motived, violent pogroms that started after 
peaceful protests took place against Moscow’s 
arbitrary separation of Armenia and decades 
of repression and discrimination. The violence 
began with the Sumgait pogroms in February 
of 1988, and continued in Kirovabad (Novem-
ber 1988), and Baku (January 1990). Fol-
lowing this, the Armenian community suffered 
through a failed war of aggression by Baku to 
subjugate the people of Artsakh. 
During this time, hundreds of Armenian civil-
ians were killed, raped, beaten, maimed, and 
expelled from their homes for no reason other 
than their ethnicity. These hateful acts were 
fueled by anti-Armenian rhetoric from Azer-
baijani officials and citizens. These pogroms 
were part of a systemic effort to ethnically 
cleanse Azerbaijan of Armenians and to send 
a message to Armenians to stop challenging 
Soviet Azerbaijani authorities. 
For over 30 years, Azerbaijan has at-
tempted to cover up these crimes against hu-
manity and has propped up the perpetrators of 
the Baku and Sumgait Pogroms as national 
heroes. It is critical that the United States gov-
ernment recognize and denounce this eth-
nically motivated violence and attacks on inno-
cent children, women, and men in Armenian 
communities. 
We must all be aware of the history of vio-
lence targeting the Armenian people. I am 
grateful that the State of Illinois emphasizes 
Armenian genocide education and I will work 
with my colleagues to promote legislation to 
help facilitate more states doing the same. We 
must ensure that the victims of the Sumgait 
and Baku pogroms are never forgotten and 
that such hateful acts of violence never hap-
pen again. We must remain committed to 
achieving a lasting peace in the Caucasus, 
and ensure that the people of Artsakh are able 
to live free from Azerbaijani abuse and ag-
gression.

DENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY 
AWARDS HONOREE 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Emilie Ma, a young student from my 
district who has been named an honoree in 
Arizona by the 2020 Prudential Spirit of Com-
munity Awards program. She was recognized 
for volunteering her time to help families strug-
gling with poverty. 
Ms. Ma assists with charitable efforts for 
low-income families at the Native Health Cen-
ter. She donates her time to a club she found-
ed at her school named the Modern Health 
Organization which provides services to pa-
tients with mental and physical needs. Ms. Ma 
has been an example to her peers, inspiring 
them to care for others and their communities. 
We must encourage and support the kind of 
selfless contributions young citizens like Ms. 
Ma make in the lives of others. We all need 
more empathy. Everyone can work together to 
help the health and vitality of our towns and 
neighborhoods. Young volunteers, like Ms. 
Ma, are inspiring examples to all of us and are 
among our brightest hopes for a better tomor-
row.

CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE GREATER PHOE-
NIX GAY & LESBIAN CHAMBER 
OF COMMERCE 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of 
the Greater Phoenix Gay & Lesbian Chamber 
of Commerce (GPGLCC). As one of the long-
est-standing LGBT agencies in our state, 
GPGLCC has promoted an inclusive business 
environment by empowering and supporting 
LGBT and LGBT-allied businesses in Phoenix. 
The GPGLCC is the oldest non-profit LGBT 
chamber of commerce in the United States 
and has been recognized as one of the 
strongest and fastest growing in the nation. By 
expanding opportunities for its over 2,000 
members and supporting Phoenix charitable 
organizations, the chamber has fostered eco-
nomic justice within the LGBT community and 
a spirit of giving in the city’s private sector. In 
addition to monthly professional development 
and networking events, the GPGLCC encour-
ages community engagement through events 
like ‘‘LGBT Night Out at the Ballet’’ and their 
Small Business Saturday Block Party. They 
have cultivated a well-rounded outlook in 
which businesses are not only economically 
beneficial to their community; they contribute 
to the culture and environment of their area as 
well. 
As the organization celebrates its fortieth 
anniversary, I wish to congratulate the Greater 
Phoenix Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Com-
merce on all of its achievements and thank 
them for their service to our city. 
RECOGNIZING LITHUANIAN 
INDEPENDENCE DAY 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is my 
distinct pleasure to take this moment to recog-
nize Lithuanian Independence Day. The Lith-
uanian American Community, Inc., East Chi-
cago Chapter, will be commemorating this 
special occasion with a celebratory event on 
Sunday, February 16, 2020, at the Chesterton 
Moose Lodge 1623 in Chesterton, Indiana. 
On February 16, 1918, an Act of Independ-
ence was signed by the Council of Lithuania, 
which gave the country its independence from 
Germany. This day is proudly celebrated as 
State Independence Day. Lithuania maintained 
its independence until 1940 when it was an-
nexed by Russia. The country remained under 
Soviet rule for almost fifty years before regain-
ing its freedom in 1990. Independence Res-
toration Day is celebrated on March 11 each 
year in honor of Lithuania’s reestablished 
independence. Lithuanians in Northwest Indi-
ana and all over the world celebrate these 
days of independence with great enthusiasm 
and pride. 
The members and leaders of the Lithuanian 
American Community, Inc., East Chicago 
Chapter, are to be honored, not only for their 
commitment to preserving tradition, but also 
for their dedication to civic, cultural, edu-
cational, and social programs. For their signifi-
cant contributions to the community of North-
west Indiana and beyond, the members and 
leaders of the Lithuanian American Commu-
nity, Inc., East Chicago Chapter, are worthy of 
the highest praise. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other 
distinguished colleagues to join me in cele-
brating Lithuanian Independence Day and 
honoring the members and leaders of the Lith-
uanian American Community, Inc., East Chi-
cago Chapter, for their loyalty and dedication 
to their culture and traditions. The Lithuanian 
community has played a key role in enriching 
the quality of life and diversity of Northwest In-
diana, and we are truly grateful for the organi-
zation’s service to Northwest Indiana and be-
yond.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF LIEU-
TENANT GENERAL THOMAS A. 
BUSSIERE 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I am deeply 
honored to express my gratitude to Lieutenant 
General Thomas A. Bussiere for his years of 
dedicated service to the United States of 
America, the Air Force, and the great state of 
Alaska. 
As Commander of Alaskan North American 
Aerospace Defense Command Region, Alas-
kan Command, and Eleventh Air Force, at 
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, he 
is responsible for the integration of all military 
activities in the Alaskan joint operations area, 
operations to defend North American air sov-
ereignty from foreign military aviation incur-
sions, and the planning and execution of all 
homeland defense operations within the area 
of responsibility. 
In 1935 Brigadier General Billy Mitchell stat-
ed, ‘‘I believe that in the future, whoever holds 
Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most 
important strategic place in the world.’’ Since 
taking command in August 2018, General 
Bussiere has expanded upon General Mitch-
ell’s sentiment and has become a tireless ad-
vocate for Alaska and Arctic readiness. So 
much so that he is the first Alaskan Command 
Commander 
to 
be 
designated 
as 
the 
USNORTHCOM Lead for Arctic Affairs. 
Since graduating from the Air Force Re-
serve Officer Training Corps at Norwich Uni-
versity in 1985, General Bussiere has exempli-
fied what it means to be an American Airman. 
However, he is more than the stars on his 
shoulders and the wings and ribbons on his 
chest that illustrate his military career. General 
Bussiere has also endeared himself to Alas-
ka’s communities. Additionally, he has contin-
ued to work with and advocate for Alaska Na-
tives. In a show of respect, three Native com-
munities bestowed Native names upon him; 
giving him the Inupiat name of Alongnonnuq, 
the Yup’ik name Evuneq, and the Tlingit name 
Litseenikaa. 
On January 13, 2020, Secretary of Defense 
Mark T. Esper announced that the President 
nominated General Bussiere for assignment 
as Deputy Commander, U.S. Strategic Com-
mand. While I am saddened to see him leave 
Alaska, I am proud that he will continue serv-
ing as a sentinel for our Nation.

STANDING UP FOR SOCIAL SECU-
RITY, MEDICARE, AND MEDICAID 
HON. ANGIE CRAIG 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, the Presi-
dent’s budget, released yesterday, proposed 
cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Secu-
rity. I’ll never stand for that. We have to make 
sure that we’re protecting our seniors. We 
can’t go back to a time when our seniors were 
living in poverty. We also have to make sure 
that we protect folks with disabilities. 
I have authored a number of pieces of legis-
lation that would reduce out-of-pocket costs 
and the price of prescription drugs. We can’t 
support this budget, and I’ll keep fighting to 
make sure that health care is affordable and 
that we take care of this nation’s seniors.

February 12, 2020 
While serving our country overseas as a 
cavalry scout in Operation Desert Storm, 
Jamie was involved in an accident that left him 
briefly paralyzed and now disabled, and wres-
tling with severe depression and PTSD. When 
he returned home, he would travel to the local 
VA for treatment where he was issued a cane 
to use that never held up. So, he decided to 
make his own out of repurposed Christmas 
trees. 
An effort that started out as a necessity 
three years ago has now grown to a team of 
60 volunteers who have made more than 220 
canes. Jamie says crafting these canes is his 
true calling and they have brought him back 
from the brink of taking his own life—and he 
has changed the lives of those around him. 
I want to honor Jamie today and thank him 
on behalf of the 25th District of Texas for his 
continued service to our nation. In God we 
trust.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOEL 
PACKER 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Joel Packer, a true hero for 
education and a dear friend. 
Joel Packer is known across the education 
community as a champion for education fund-
ing. He spent more than 40 years advocating 
for students both in the public and private sec-
tor. Starting at the Student Association of the 
State University of New York, his career as an 
advocate grew with his work in D.C. at the Na-
tional Education Association, and most re-
cently, The Raben Group and the Committee 
for Education Funding (CEF) before his retire-
ment in 2016. 
Joel worked on critical issues like education 
funding, higher education, environmental haz-
ards in schools, and civil rights. He was on the 
front lines of the push to improve testing in No 
Child Left Behind and was always there to re-
mind us who we need to be prioritizing in the 
Congress: our children and their education. 
Joel championed the coalition of education ad-
vocates at CEF and masterfully represented 
the interests of a diverse group of educational 
institutions. Joel led the CEF’s fight against 
education budget cuts in 2015, never giving 
up on his mission to ensure a genuine federal 
investment 
in 
our 
children’s 
education. 
Throughout his career, Joel’s dedication dem-
onstrated the kind of intensity and willingness 
to collaborate necessary to win in the fight for 
education. Moreover, his passion for education 
and bettering the lives of all students was 
clear. Joel was an expert when it came to 
education policy and the Appropriations proc-
ess; he knew, and helped all of us learn, how 
good ideas and good policies are not good 
enough—not without the necessary resources 
to make a difference. 
I feel lucky to have known such a tremen-
dous advocate for education in this country. 
Joel was many things—he was an amazing 
husband, a proud father and grandfather, an 
inspiring mentor and colleague, and an un-
wavering friend. Joel was taken from us too 
suddenly, and my deepest condolences go to 
his family. We will miss Joel and his bound-
less passion for fighting for what is right and 
for what our nation’s children need most. 
Joel’s values and mission will live on in those 
of us who remain in the fight, and we fight in 
his honor. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in remembering Joel Packer. He was a 
true champion for education and his leader-
ship will never be forgotten.

30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BAKU 
POGROMS: 
REMEMBERING 
THE 
VICTIMS 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of the victims of po-
groms against the Armenian population in 
then-Soviet Azerbaijan thirty years ago: These 
attacks against Armenian Christians happened 
between 1988 and 1990 in the cities of 
Sumgait (February 27 to 29, 1988), Kirovabad 
(November 21 to 27, 1988) and the city of 
Baku (January 13 to 29, 1990). 
It is clear that the pogrom of Armenians in 
Baku was not a spontaneous and one-time 
event, but the culmination sofa series of ethnic 
violence waged against Armenians. In 1988, 
the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, an eth-
nic Armenian enclave forcibly separated from 
Armenia and incorporated into Soviet Azer-
baijan, began to voice their demand for reunifi-
cation with Armenia. Their peaceful protests 
were reinforced by the February 20, 1988 vote 
by the Soviet of People’s Deputies in 
Karabakh requesting the transfer of the region 
to Armenia. These events were taking place in 
the context of Mikhail Gorbachev’s Perestroika 
and Glasnost. Unfortunately, Moscow and Az-
erbaijani authorities rejected these calls and 
strong anti-Armenian sentiment was whipped 
up, including calls for the death and ouster of 
the Armenian population. 
On February 27, 1988, a massive pogrom 
was carried out in Sumgait where the Arme-
nian population was brutally slaughtered and 
expelled. The Sumgait pogrom was followed 
by a pogrom in Kirovabad, the second largest 
city in Azerbaijan, where all the Armenians 
were expelled. After these tragedies, a mas-
sive migration of Armenians from Azerbaijan 
began, along with the migration of approxi-
mately 200,000 Azerbaijanis and Muslim 
Kurds who exited Armenia. By 1989, Arme-
nians remaining in Azerbaijan stayed only in 
those places where they had well-established 
communities, as in Baku. 
In January 1990, a series of Azerbaijan po-
litical rallies took place, and on January 13th, 
a crowd of about 50,000 divided into groups 
and began raiding and invading Armenian 
homes, brutalizing the inhabitants, including 
women and children, and destroying and burn-
ing houses, businesses and other community 
structures. The rallying cry was to cleanse the 
city of Armenians. The violence, killings, 
rapes, beatings, looting and forcible expulsion 
of Armenians persisted between January 13th 
and 20th. It is still unknown the exact number 
of people killed, but estimates place the death 
toll around 450 people. Throughout it all, local 
militia and Soviet troops stood by as the vio-
lence escalated over a week’s time. Not until 
the evening of January 20th, after most of the 
Armenian population had fled or been expelled 
from Baku, did the Soviet Army intervene to 
stop the seven-day massacre. 
Garry Kasparov was born in Baku in 1963. 
His mother was Armenian. In 1985, he be-
came the youngest ever World Chess Cham-
pion. In January 1990, he was excelling in his 
competitions, and ranked as the No. 1 chess 
player in the world. Yet in January 1990, he 
bravely returned to Baku, into the midst of 
massacre and carnage, to rescue and evac-
uate the families of his friends and relatives. 
Describing those events, he has testified that: 
‘‘No one would halt the Armenian pogroms 
in Baku, although there were eleven thousand 
soldiers of internal troops in the city. No one 
would intervene until the ethnic cleansing was 
carried out. The pogroms were happening not 
in a random place, but in the huge capital city 
with blocks of flats. In such a megapolis as 
Baku, the crowd simply cannot carry out tar-
geted operations like that. When the pogrom- 
makers go purposefully from one district to an-
other, from one apartment to another, this 
means that they had been given the address-
es and that they had a coordinator.’’ 
I don’t mean to simplify the complex history 
and people of this region, but these pogroms 
set the stage for more than two decades of 
aggression by Azerbaijan against Armenians, 
during which Azerbaijan initiated and lost a 
war against Nagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan’s 
persecution of Armenians continues even 
today in attacks against Nagorno-Karabakh, 
now known as the Republic of Artsakh. 
There has yet to be an independent inves-
tigation of the events that occurred between 
1988 and 1990 that emptied Azerbaijan of its 
Armenian population. No one has been held 
accountable for the violence and the deaths. 
Azerbaijan remains in turmoil because of the 
fanaticism and thirst to ethnically cleanse the 
entire region ofArmenian Christians. 
The U.S. Congress forcefully spoke out dur-
ing the period of 1988 to 1990 against these 
massacres and expulsions of Armenians by 
Azerbaijan. We have rejected the Azeri war 
against Nagorno Karabakh and stood in soli-
darity with the Armenian people of Artsakh. 
We will continue to do so. 
Madam Speaker, today I remember all the 
victims and I honor all the survivors of these 
terrible acts of ethnic cleansing. May all the 
people of Armenia and Artsakh live in peace 
and freedom for which they have sacrificed 
and suffered so much.

RECOGNIZING LINDA RENE´  
MATTHEWS ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. MARCIA L. FUDGE 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Ms. FUDGE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to a constituent, employee and friend, 
Linda Rene´ Matthews, as she retires from the 
U.S. House of Representatives, where she 
has served in the District Office of the 11th 
Congressional District of Ohio since January 
of 2009. 
In fact, she served me so well while I was 
Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, that I 
knew she would be invaluable as a congres-
sional staffer. I was right. 
Linda has been a strong, stable force, who 
has always understood the needs of constitu-
ents and worked hard to be of service to them 
and me. Her loyalty is unfaltering, her advice 
always candid, and her care for the integrity of 
my offices unquestionable. 
After more than 20 years with me, Linda 
has decided to retire effective February 29, 
2020. She leaves a legacy that set a standard 
in so many ways. She is more than the title of 
Scheduler/Office Manager implies, serving so 
many years as a member of my team of advi-
sors. So, I say: 
Whereas, Linda Rene´ Matthews has spent 
most of her professional life as a public serv-
ant; and 
Whereas, Ms. Matthews has served the 
people of Northeast Ohio for over twenty 
years, first in the Office of the Mayor of 
Warrensville Heights and now in the District 
Office of the 11th Congressional District of 
Ohio; and 
Whereas, Ms. Matthews is a life-long resi-
dent of the 11th Congressional District of 
Ohio; and 
Whereas, Ms. Matthews has served the 
constituents of the 11th Congressional District 
of Ohio with distinction for more than eleven 
(11) years; and 
Whereas, Ms. Matthews is retiring as 
Scheduler and Office Manager in the District 
Office of the 11th Congressional District of 
Ohio; 
Resolved, that the 11th Congressional Dis-
trict of Ohio acknowledges, salutes and cele-
brates its resident and servant leader, Linda 
Rene´ Matthews, this 12th day of February 
2020, for her record of excellence in service,

CONGRATULATING DR. CHARLENE 
M. DUKES ON HER RETIREMENT 
AS 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
PRINCE 
GEORGE’S COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate an outstanding and trailblazing lead-
er in higher education in Maryland’s Fifth Dis-
trict. Dr. Charlene M. Dukes will be retiring as 
President of Prince George’s Community Col-
lege this June after thirteen years at the helm. 
She is the first woman to lead the College in 
its sixty-two-year history. 
Dr. Dukes’s time as President has been 
characterized by growth and a deepening of 
the College’s mission. She oversaw a partner-
ship with Prince George’s County Public 
Schools to create the first middle college in 
our state as well as a new Teacher Academy, 
Academy for Health Sciences, and two P-Tech 
Schools. The College joined with the Univer-
sity of Maryland Global Campus to launch a 
3D Scholars Program and to expand programs 
in information technology and math. Under 
President Dukes’s leadership, the College built 
new buildings at its Largo campus, including 
Lanham and Bladen Halls, the Culinary Arts 
Center, the Center for Performing Arts, and 
the Center for Health Studies. She led the ef-
fort to begin a major renovation this year of 
Marlboro Hall, the College’s largest classroom 
facility. 
A proponent of streamlining operations to 
enhance the quality of its services, Dr. Dukes 
oversaw a process of realigning the College’s 
organizational structure under the 2019–2021 
Strategic Plan. That plan focuses on increas-
ing student success, growing the College’s re-
gional impact, and ensuring that the College’s 
organization excels in helping it serve the 
40,000 students who benefit annually from its 
courses and programs. 
Before becoming the eighth President of 
Prince George’s Community College, Dr. 
Dukes served on the Prince George’s County 
Board of Education and as adjunct faculty at 
the Community College of Allegheny County in 
Pittsburgh. She also taught at Prince George’s 
Community College and at Morgan State Uni-
versity. Former Governor Martin O’Malley ap-
pointed her to serve on the State Board of 
Education from 2007 to 2015, and she was 
the Board’s President for the last three years 
of that period. Recognized by Washington 
Magazine as one of the 100 most powerful 
women in the metro area in 2011, 2013, 2015, 
and 2017, Dr. Dukes was inducted into the 
Maryland Women’s Hall of Fame in 2013. She 
continues to serve on the boards of Prince 
George’s County Chamber of Commerce, the 
Biden Institute, the Business Roundtable, the 
Greater Washington Community Foundation, 
the Institute for Higher Education Policy, and 
Campus Compact, among other nonprofits. 
When Dr. Dukes retires at the end of June, 
she will leave a powerful and lasting legacy for 
the College and for the county and state she 
has so faithfully served in the cause of higher 
education. Because of her leadership, thou-
sands of Maryland students have access to 
quality, affordable community college that can 
serve as a pathway to opportunity and suc-
cess. I join in thanking her for her service, and 
I congratulate her on her upcoming retirement.

CLUB AND THE ZONTA CLUB OF

HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Centennial Celebration of the 
Kiwanis Club of Joliet and Zonta International. 
Since its formation in 1920, The Kiwanis 
Club of Joliet has had a strong commitment to 
our community. They have supported cher-
ished programs like Big Brothers/Big Sisters, 
the Center for Disability Services, the Guard-
ian Angel Community Services, and many 
more. Currently, they sponsor several high 
school and middle school community clubs, in-
spiring our youth to give back as well. 
The Zonta Club of Joliet is a service-based 
organization committed to promoting women 
both locally and globally. Through fundraisers, 
they finance scholarships, grants, international 
projects, and charities. They are also the 
sponsors of the Joliet Central High School 
Fearless Females, a club dedicated to em-
powering young women. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the Kiwanis Club of Joliet 
and Joliet International for 100 years of dedi-
cation to our community, and I wish them the 
best in the years to come.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DECREASE 
NOISE LEVEL ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of the Decrease 
Noise Level Act. 
For millions of Americans, noise from air-
craft is a constant source of torment, whether 
they live right near an airport or under a reg-
ular flight path. Chronic exposure to excessive 
noise can lead to sleep deprivation, task inter-
ruptions, among other negative consequences, 
which result in untold costs on society in di-
minished work productivity. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
currently uses a Day-Night average noise level 
to assess the level at which noise exposure 
becomes ‘‘significant’’ in residential commu-
nities. However, the level that the FAA has 
currently deemed acceptable is 65, a full 10 
decibels higher than what Europe allows. 
FAA’s use of 65 DNL as ‘‘significant’ is 
based on severe and immediate health im-
pacts, at which point damage has already 
been done. It is essential that the FAA con-
siders quality of life, long-term health impacts, 
home values, and overall economic impact. I 
believe reasonable noise congestion levels 
should be based on a standard that falls well 
before the point at which long-term health is 
impacted. 
That is why I am introducing the Decrease 
Noise Level (DNL) Act—a bill that would re-
quire the FAA to immediately lower the level 
of noise that is considered ‘‘significant’’ to 60, 
and create a plan to lower it to 55 within 10 
years. It would also require community out-
reach from the FAA to promote its recent 
study that considers alternatives to the DNL 
as a metric to measure noise. 
I urge my colleagues to join me to pass this 
important legislation.

GREAT LAKES RESTORATION 
INITIATIVE 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate House passage of H. R. 4031, the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019, 
which will support the health of America’s 
Third Coast. The Great Lakes provide drinking 
water to more than 30 million people, support 
more than 300,000 jobs, and are home to 
more than 3,500 plant and animal species. 
The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is a 
multi-agency program that addresses threats 
to this ecosystem, such as algal blooms and 
invasive species. More than 4,700 projects 
have already been completed under GLRI, 
leading to healthier fisheries, clean drinking 
water, and stronger wildlife habitats. 
I was proud to cosponsor this bill to reau-
thorize GLRI with increased funding. I thank 
my colleagues for passing this bill last week 
and I urge swift passage in the Senate.

CELEBRATING THE 40TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF PHOENIX PRIDE 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of 
Phoenix Pride. As one of the longest-standing 
LGBTQ+ organizations in our state, their work 
has taken the values of diversity, inclusivity, 
and equality to every corner of the state of Ari-
zona. 
Phoenix Pride is a groundbreaking pillar of 
advocacy for the city’s LGBTQ+ community. In 
addition to producing the two largest annual 
LGBTQ+ events in Arizona, they work exten-
sively to reach out to marginalized commu-
nities, preserve the unique culture and history 
of LGBTQ+ Arizonans, and provide scholar-
ship funding for LGBTQ+ students. In fact, the 
organization awarded over $47,000 in scholar-
ships in 2019 and has helped dozens of stu-
dents reach their academic goals since 2008. 
Thanks in part to the hard work of Phoenix 
Pride, 
Phoenix 
ranks 
among 
the 
most 
LGBTQ+-friendly cities in the state, with pro-
tections against discrimination and a strong, 
involved LGBTQ+ community. Our city cer-
tainly would not be the same without their tire-
less work for equality and justice. 
They have served as a beacon of hope and 
growth in the fight for equality for decades. 
The changes experienced and catalyzed by 
Phoenix Pride over the last forty years have 
been tremendous, and I join them in working 
to ensure that the next forty bring even more 
progress. 
As they celebrate their fortieth anniversary, 
I wish to congratulate Phoenix Pride on all of 
their achievements and thank them for their 
service to our city. 
HONORING DR. LYNDA YOUNG 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Dr. Lynda Young, whose 
term as chair of the American Academy of Pe-
diatrics (AAP) Committee on Federal Govern-
ment Affairs wraps up later this month. I have 
had the honor and privilege of calling Dr. 
Young a friend and working with her for many 
years, and I know her to be a brilliant pediatri-
cian and tireless advocate for the well-being of 
all children and families. 
For 34 years, Dr. Young has been a prac-
ticing pediatrician in Worcester, Massachu-
setts as well as serving as a Professor of Pe-
diatrics at the University of Massachusetts 
Medical School. Throughout her career, she’s 
worked with numerous non-profits serving chil-
dren in Central Massachusetts and devoted 
countless hours to advocating on behalf of 
children at the local, state and national levels. 
After serving as a member of the AAP’s 
Committee on Federal Government Affairs for 
several years, it was no surprise that Dr. 
Young was elected chair in 2016. During her 
tenure, she’s never shied away from a fight 
where the well-being of children was in ques-
tion. Among her many accomplishments dur-
ing her time as chair include serving as a 
plaintiff in a successful federal lawsuit against 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
which resulted in a court order requiring the 
FDA to finalize graphic warning labels for ciga-
rettes; fighting for a 10-year extension of the 
vitally important Children’s Health Insurance 
Program; defeating attempts to repeal and re-
place the transformative Affordable Care Act; 
and co-chairing four national AAP Legislative 
Conferences in Washington, D.C. Dr. Young 
has also been an integral contributor to the 
AAP’s Blueprint for Children: How the Next 
President Can Build a Foundation for a 
Healthy Future, which outlines federal policy 
priorities for the next presidential administra-
tion on improving children’s health. 
Madam Speaker, for all of Dr. Young’s ac-
colades and accomplishments, none resonate 
more than the day-in and day-out care she 
provides for children and their families as a 
pediatrician. She is compassionate and reas-
suring during tough times. She takes the time 
to really listen to and take an interest in her 
patients. She is always there for them and she 
has made an extraordinary difference in the 
lives of thousands of children. And I speak 
from firsthand experience—Dr. Young was my 
children’s pediatrician in Worcester. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to warmly 
congratulate Dr. Young on her successful ten-
ure as chair of the AAP’s Committee on Fed-
eral Government Affairs. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with her to improve the lives of 
all children and their families.

SUPPORTING H.J. RES. 79 AND THE 
EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
Gentlelady from California, Ms. SPEIER, has in-
troduced H.J. Res. 79, legislation that would 
provide for the Equal Rights Amendment’s im-
mediate 
adoption 
as 
the 
Twenty-Eighth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. As Ma-
jority Leader, I am proud to bring that legisla-
tion to the Floor this week. Because House 
rules prohibit the addition of further cospon-
sors to a bill once the committee report has 
been filed, however, I am not able formally to 
cosponsor this legislation. I am in support of 
the bill and request to be considered by this 
body as a cosponsor of H.J. Res. 79.

pogroms committed in Sumgait, Kirovabad, 
and Maraga, should never be forgotten. Dur-
ing this horrific period, the Armenian popu-
lation of the former Soviet Azerbaijan were the 
victims of state-sponsored violence. These 
acts of violence paved the way for outright war 
against Nagorno-Karabakh and decades of 
conflict. The legacy of this conflict persists 
today. 
The Soviet-sanctioned violence against the 
Armenian 
population 
in 
Azerbaijan 
and 
Nagorno-Karabakh earned strong condemna-
tion from the United States Congress, which 
we are proud to uphold today. The systematic 
looting, maiming, and murder of Armenians 
permitted and encouraged by the Soviet Gov-
ernment remain a terrible stain on our world 
history. On this anniversary, it is vital that we 
recommit ourselves and United States policy 
to healing the pain caused by anti-Armenian 
aggression. 
I urge the Trump Administration to support 
life-saving programs like demining assistance 
in Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as officially rec-
ognize the Republic of Artsakh. It is past time 
to implement carefully crafted, bipartisan pro-
posals to cement peace in the region. Only by 
doing so can we honor the memory of the 
countless victims of the anti-Armenian po-
groms and their descendants. I am proud to 
stand with Armenians and Armenian-Ameri-
cans on this solemn day.

CITY OF SAN JOAQUIN 
CENTENNIAL 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of the City of San Joaquin 
which celebrates its 100th anniversary this 
month. 
The City of San Joaquin is a vibrant com-
munity located in rural Fresno County on what 
was previously part of a large ranch settled by 
Jefferson James, a miner and cattle rancher. 
After James’ passing, his heirs sold their prop-
erty to settlers, led by a gentleman by the 
name of Benjamin F. Graham, who created a 
formal plan for the community to be named 
Grahamtown. 
Graham sold the land to a company that, 
under the direction of their representative Dr. 
Hernan Janz, established the community of 
San Joaquin. When the Southern Pacific Rail-
road established a line passing through San 
Joaquin in 1912, the flow of commerce ex-
panded the area’s economy. On February 14, 
1920 the community elected to incorporate 
and became formally established as the City 
of San Joaquin. 
Over the years, San Joaquin has become a 
hub of the agricultural industry with farms that 
produce food that feeds the world. Today, San 
Joaquin is known as the ‘‘everything is pos-
sible city’’ and continues to be a beacon of 
progress, aptly demonstrating a wholesome, 
rural way of life. 
It is communities like San Joaquin that have 
shaped California’s Central Valley, and indeed 
our country, into what it is today. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in congratulating the City of 
San Joaquin and its residents on their first 100 
years and in wishing them well in the many 
years to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOE 
BONAMASSA 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. 
WITTMAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Joe 
Bonamassa is one of the most gifted, talented 
and accomplished singer, songwriter and 
guitarists in modern day blues. Blues is a 
quintessential American musical art form and 
Joe, throughout his life, has embraced and ex-
celled in his pursuit of mastering this music. 
Joe, in exhibiting his extraordinary talents at 
the very early age of 4, was blessed to have 
his parents, Len and Debra Bonamassa, do 
everything possible to nurture and develop 
Joe’s undeniable talent. Joe met the blues leg-
end BB King after his mother received a call 
asking him to be the opening act for a concert 
headlined by King. Joe’s incredible talent so 
impressed BB King that he was asked to con-
tinue as the opener and did over 20 shows 
with King by 1989. Len and Debra made sig-
nificant sacrifices to help Joe realize his po-
tential, including engaging Danny Gatton to 
mentor and train him. Len, who owned a gui-
tar shop with his wife and a musician himself, 
cultivated not only Joe’s interest in music but 
also his love of guitars. It is that connection 
with the guitar that is evident in all that Joe 
pursues in the world of music. He is an avid 
collector of guitars and amplifiers and is a 
subject matter expert on both the history and 
the mechanics of these instruments. He gra-
ciously shares his extensive collection of gui-
tars and amplifiers with the public at one of 
the greatest guitar collections in the world— 
Nerdville, California. The ‘‘Bonaseum’’ as it is 
sometimes called displays some of the most 
historic and iconic guitars and amplifiers in the 
history of modern music. 
Joe has released 13 studio albums and a 
fantastic series of live albums and DVDs that 
capture the essence of what makes him ex-
traordinary, which is his ability to connect with 
folks before a live audience. His incredible tal-
ent and the phenomenal musicians he selects 
to play with him make for an unparalleled ex-
perience for his fans. Joe has pioneered a dif-
ferent way of doing business in the music in-
dustry. Not satisfied that he couldn’t perform 
his music the way he wanted but the way the 
music industry dictated in a ones size fits all 
mentality, Joe broke the mold and did things 
his way. He took a big risk in developing a 
new business plan for his musical enterprise 
and was not sure at the time if he would sur-
vive in the music industry. He has persevered 
and now prospers in performing his craft the 
way he believes is best. He saw that there is 
a connection between recording and live per-
formances and has revolutionized the industry 
by developing and implementing a business 
that connects studio recording, live perform-
ances and booking his own shows. He has fo-
cused on playing smaller venues where the 
experience matches his style and magnitude 
of his performance. He has performed for over 
30 years and continues to practice relentlessly 
and work incredibly hard at his craft. Every 
day he wakes up he is excited about the gui-
tar and is equally thrilled to play it. Joe is one 
of the most thoughtful, caring and passionate 
artists in the music business. He has done a 
tremendous service to the world of blues 
music by creating the Keeping the Blues Alive 
Foundation. This foundation each year brings 
together some of the best blues artists on the 
planet to share their talents with folks in a 
close, intimate setting. This connection with 
music fans is a great opportunity for both 
emerging and established artists to enjoy play-
ing in a small venue and to raise money for 
a great cause. The Foundation awards grant 
money to extend the reach and value of the 
musical experience, especially in schools. Joe 
is extremely accessible, humble, and infinitely 
committed to encouraging others to pursue 
their musical interest just as his mom and dad 
from childhood. Our nation truly values the ef-
forts and contributions of Joe Bonamassa to 
the world of music and his efforts to preserve 
guitar history and to inspire others in their mu-
sical pursuits.

RECOGNIZING JUDGE JAMES L. 
ROBERTS, JR. 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Circuit Judge James 
L. Roberts, Jr., who retired from the Pontotoc 
County Courthouse after a 48-year judiciary 
career. 
Judge Roberts was born on June 8, 1945, 
in Pontotoc County, Mississippi. He attended 
public school in Pontotoc County and later 
pursued higher education at Millsaps College 
in Jackson, Mississippi. He then earned his 
M.B.A. at Mississippi State University in 
Starkville and later received his J.D. from the 
University of Mississippi in Oxford. 
As a life-long public servant, Judge Roberts 
served as Pontotoc County Prosecuting Attor-
ney, municipal judge, chancery judge, circuit 
judge, Mississippi Supreme Court Justice, and 
was the Mississippi Commissioner of Public 
Safety for four years. 
Throughout his life and to this day, Judge 
Roberts has set an example for others to fol-
low. He and his wife, Mrs. Rose D. Roberts, 
are active members of Pontotoc First United 
Methodist Church. He has served the church 
as administrative council member and chair, 
trustee member and chair, finance member 
and chair, lay leader, head usher, and Sunday 
School Teacher. 
I thank Judge Roberts for his lifelong dedi-
cation to the law and for making Mississippi a 
better place. I wish him many years of good 
health.

CITY 
WITH SPIRIT OF MONTANA COM-
MENDATION 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Bob Drake of Helena, Jordan 
Alexander of East Helena, and Rick Abraham 
of Montana City for their many decades of 
service to their volunteer fire departments. 
Bob grew up knowing he wanted to be a 
firefighter. His father was one of the founding 
members of the former Lakeside Fire Depart-
ment that was created in 1973. In 1995, Bob 
followed in his father’s footsteps and became 
a volunteer firefighter. Six years later, Bob be-
came the department’s volunteer fire chief. 
Bob will retire this month after 25 years on the 
job. 
Jordan began his firefighting career at just 
17, working at the station in Bozeman. After 
two years, he graduated high school and went 
on to college. After Jordan made his way to 
Helena in 1989, he started volunteering at the 
Baxendale Volunteer Fire Department. In 
2012, he became fire chief. This month, Jor-
dan retired after 30 years of total service. 
Rick started firefighting in 1989 for the Mon-
tana City Volunteer Fire Department. In 2001, 
he became fire chief. Rick says it never 
ceases to amaze him how volunteers leave 
birthday parties or Christmas dinners in a mo-
ment’s notice to help people in their time of 
need. In June, Rick will retire after 31 years at 
the department. 
These men say their favorite part of the job 
is the impact the department has on the com-
munity. They help people on their worst days. 
They help their neighbors, friends, and fami-
lies who face catastrophe. Everyone in the 
community breathes a little easier as they see 
each of these men and their departments 
coming down the road to help in their time of 
crisis. 
Bob, Jordan and Rick also spoke about the 
power of the volunteer and how they join the 
department with their day jobs and hobbies. 
The banker comes, the nurse comes, the elec-
trician comes, and the teacher comes. The 
volunteers form a diverse, powerful group that 
serves their community to its fullest. 
Madam Speaker, for their incredible leader-
ship at the helm of the Tri-Lakes Volunteer 
Fire Department, Baxendale Volunteer Fire 
Department, and the Montana City Volunteer 
Fire Department, I recognize Bob Drake, Jor-
dan Alexander, and Rick Abraham for their 
Spirit of Montana.
