Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2020 
No. 202 
House of Representatives 
The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Wednesday, December 2, 2020, at 2 p.m. 
Senate 
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2020 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Master, continue to be our 
shelter from life’s storms and winds. 
You have provided us with Your pres-
ence and a reminder in Hebrews 13:5 
that You will never leave or forsake us. 
May this knowledge of Your watch- 
care sustain our Senators through this 
challenging season. Grant that their 
work will become more meaningful and 
effective as they cultivate a greater 
awareness of Your divine companion-
ship. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH MORTON 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
each 52 weeks of the year, I do four 
telephone news conferences with dif-
ferent groups of journalists. Most of 
the journalists are Iowans. 
Each week, without failure, a famil-
iar voice opens one of my press calls 
with a very thoughtful question on 
some matter of interest to folks in the 
heartland of America. For more than 
two decades at the Omaha World-Her-
ald, Joe Morton has cut through the 
beltway noise to deliver real news to 
my constituents in Iowa and those in 
Nebraska. 
Sadly, his tenure at the paper ended 
just before Thanksgiving. So I want to 
take this opportunity to thank Joe for 
his decades of keeping Americans in-
formed about the work of their elected 
leaders. So I say: Best of luck to Joe, 
wherever the future takes him. And if 
anybody in this area is looking for a 
dedicated journalist, you ought to con-
sider Joe. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the latest results of vaccine trials con-
tinue to suggest that our victory over 
the coronavirus is on the horizon. But 
here in Washington, the additional re-
lief that would help families, workers, 
schools, and small businesses cross the 
finish line has been held up for months 
while Democratic leaders pursued an 
all-or-nothing approach. 
When the Speaker of the House put 
forward the so-called Heroes Act back 
in 
May, 
multiple—multiple—House 
Democrats called it out for the polit-
ical stunt that it clearly was. One 
Democrat said it was ‘‘not focused,’’ 
‘‘rushed to a vote too fast,’’ and it 
‘‘doesn’t help us accomplish [the] core 
mission’’ of helping struggling people. 
Well, after several months with no 
progress, this same Democrat just said 
a few days ago that Senate Repub-
licans’ proposal is ‘‘a bill we can pass’’ 
and ‘‘we should negotiate that to the 
finish.’’ Even Speaker PELOSI’s own 
Members think our Senate Republican 
bill is better than hers. 
Well, let’s hope our Democratic col-
leagues will finally let us make law in 
all the enormously important areas 
where we do not even disagree. 
In the meantime, the Senate will pro-
ceed with pressing business on the Ex-
ecutive Calendar. We will vote to con-
firm several more well-qualified nomi-
nees, beginning today with Taylor 
McNeel, the President’s choice to serve 
as U.S. District Judge for the Southern 
District of Mississippi. 
I hope each of my colleagues will join 
me in supporting this impressive nomi-
nee and those who will follow. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA MCSALLY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on an entirely different matter, as 
the 116th Congress draws to a close, I 
once again face a task that is among 
my favorite and least favorite jobs at 
this particular time: bidding farewell 
to some of the people we proudly call 
colleagues and friends. But I will take

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7118 
December 1, 2020 
any excuse to brag about the impres-
sive men and women we get to work 
alongside every single day. 
Today, I will begin with the junior 
Senator 
from 
Arizona, 
MARTHA 
MCSALLY. For the last 2 years, Senator 
MCSALLY has held the seat formerly 
occupied by our dear friend John 
McCain. It is only fitting that our 
‘‘Maverick’’ was followed by a fellow 
veteran and pilot who has approached 
her service to the people of Arizona 
with such unabashed pride. 
By her own account, if you had asked 
a school-aged MARTHA MCSALLY, who 
was apparently both shy and prone to 
motion sickness, whether a career in 
cockpits and then politics sounded ap-
pealing, she would have looked at you 
like you were crazy. But, even then, 
the future full-bird colonel and Senator 
was already on her way to a life defined 
by service. 
When MARTHA lost her father, a Navy 
veteran, at a young age, his final words 
to her were: ‘‘Make me proud.’’ ‘‘Make 
me proud.’’ With this challenge in 
mind, the youngest of five children 
took her academic and athletic talents 
to the U.S. Air Force Academy. The 
plan was to earn a trip to medical 
school through military service. 
Back then, a ground-based career 
must have sounded like a sensible plan. 
After all, being a combat pilot wasn’t 
an option back then for female officers, 
and, besides, she was on the wrong side 
of the height requirement for any pi-
lot’s seat. No women and no people her 
size were eligible at the time. 
But after a ride-along training mis-
sion in an F–16 during one of her sum-
mer assignments, Cadet MCSALLY real-
ized that flying was just too cool to 
pass up. Some doors were going to have 
to open to make it an option, but if 
those doors weren’t open already, then, 
MARTHA MCSALLY was prepared to bust 
them down. That meant shaking off 
three straight rejections for a medical 
waiver of the height requirement. It 
meant inventing new tests to prove her 
exceptional aptitude, not only among 
the female candidates but the entire 
pool. It meant not taking ‘‘no’’ for an 
answer and ruffling as many feathers 
as needed until she got to serve. Of 
course, none of these skills and talents 
would sound at all familiar to us here 
in the Senate—not at all. 
By the time our future colleague won 
her spot as the first woman behind the 
stick of a combat fighter mission, she 
was charting a unique course in more 
ways than one. Her place in the squad-
ron had made history, and the jet she 
flew—the 
A–10 
‘‘Warthog’’—had 
a 
unique place of its own. 
The A–10 flies low over the battle-
field. It provides close air support, 
hunting and destroying threats to 
friendly forces on the ground. It is a 
machinegun on wings that holds spe-
cial respect among combat military. 
Many seasoned soldiers have a story 
or two about times when pilots like 
MARTHA MCSALLY swooped in to get 
them out of a bind. So MARTHA’s flight 
hours were literally clearing the way 
for her fellow servicemembers in more 
ways than one. 
Her trailblazing helped change the 
perception and treatment of women in 
our Armed Forces. In one instance, she 
took the DOD to court over unfair 
dress codes for female servicemembers 
overseas and won an important change 
in policy. 
Pretty quickly, folks caught on to 
the fact that when Colonel MCSALLY 
put her mind to something, it got done. 
So, naturally, when the then-Congress-
woman was sworn in here in the Sen-
ate, she dove into tracking down an-
swers for her fellow Arizonans, solu-
tions for American servicemembers, 
and the care and justice her fellow vet-
erans deserve. 
From her first day, Senator MCSALLY 
reminded everyone here that public 
service is personal, that what we do 
here has a direct impact on the lives of 
millions of Americans. So after swear-
ing the oath on a Bible recovered from 
the bombing of the USS Arizona at 
Pearl Harbor, she brought her experi-
ence and expertise to solving issues 
that are personal to her and to others 
who have worn the uniform. 
In solidarity with her fellow A–10 pi-
lots and the forces they protect, Sen-
ator MCSALLY fought to preserve and 
fund that unique weapon. Using her 
role on the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, she let her own painful 
personal experiences with sexual as-
sault in the military fuel the pursuit of 
justice for fellow survivors. She au-
thored expanded protections for service 
academy students who experienced as-
sault, she proposed new preservation 
requirements for service records to pro-
mote accountability, and she made 
sure each was included when the Sen-
ate passed Defense authorizations. 
Her service to men and women in 
uniform didn’t stop with those on Ac-
tive Duty. Senator MCSALLY has also 
championed expanded care and services 
for our veterans as they transition 
back to civilian life, greater Federal 
support for telehealth and suicide pre-
vention, and expanded veterans treat-
ment courts. 
So many important changes have 
been 
enacted 
because 
MARTHA 
MCSALLY made them happen. 
Last year, it came to her attention 
that one remarkable 95-year-old Ari-
zona veteran had not received the for-
mal recognition he deserved for distin-
guished service back in World War II. 
Senator MCSALLY made sure he got 
that Purple Heart, hand-delivered, with 
dozens of young airmen on hand to 
honor him. 
The junior Senator from Arizona has 
charted a singular course. She has bal-
anced respect for tradition with an eye 
toward the future. She opened count-
less new doors for others. At every sin-
gle step, our colleague has done it with 
dignity, faith, and a deep love of her 
State and her country that she cannot 
help but wear on her sleeve. 
She departs with a long list of ac-
complishments and every reason to 
hold her head high. Wherever life after 
the Senate takes her, I am confident 
our colleague will continue to be the 
most enthusiastic advocate for her 
State—for its people, its prosperity, 
and its natural wonders. That includes 
all the interesting creatures that she 
and her four-legged wingman, Boomer, 
meet when they are out hiking the 
trails. 
No, I am pretty certain MARTHA 
MCSALLY is not through fighting yet. 
So, MARTHA, on behalf of not just the 
Senate but the Nation, thank you so 
much for your service to our country, 
in uniform and here in the Senate. We 
wish you all the best in the bright days 
to come.

OFFICER.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, I mentioned the several big- 
ticket items left on the congressional 
agenda before the end of the year. Over 
the next few weeks, the Senate must 
pass an appropriations bill to keep the 
government funded. We must pass the 
annual Defense bill, a piece of legisla-
tion that Congress has passed every 
year for nearly 60 years in a row. And 
a top priority as well is a major COVID 
relief bill. 
We are in a moment of genuine na-
tional catastrophe. The rate of new 
cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are 
at the highest, or near the highest, of

December 1, 2020 
any point during this awful pandemic. 
The economic fallout of the pandemic 
spreads and spreads. November saw the 
largest single 2-week jump in unem-
ployment benefit applications since 
early April, and enhanced job benefits 
are only a few weeks from expiration. 
The time has come for Congress to 
pass a bipartisan COVID relief bill that 
meets the needs of our workers, our 
families, our schools, and our busi-
nesses. The Republican leader of this 
Chamber knows very well that the only 
way to pass legislation in the Senate is 
with a measure of bipartisanship. But 
time and time again, the Republican 
leader’s idea of action on COVID has 
been to bring partisan legislation to 
the floor and then demand everyone ac-
cept it. 
Every single iteration has included 
poison pills designed to ensure that the 
bill is bad—not consensus proposals. 
That is not what these poison pills are 
at all, and he knows darn well the 
Democrats don’t agree to them. Well, 
that is no way to do business around 
here. 
The leader’s view seems to be that 
the only things that should be consid-
ered in the next COVID relief bill are 
items that Republicans approve of, 
even if the needs of the country go way 
beyond what is on their narrow list. So 
I would plead again to the Republican 
leader and to my colleagues on the 
other side, we need to come together. 
Both sides—both sides—must be willing 
to compromise. 
While the Republicans in this Cham-
ber enjoy a majority, they must grap-
ple with the fact that Democrats hold 
a majority in the House. We cannot 
make a law without Democrats in the 
House, and, frankly, Democratic votes 
in the Senate because there are a good 
number of Republicans who won’t vote 
for any proposal. 
So we need a true bipartisan bill, not 
another round of partisan Republican 
proposals put forward by the leader and 
then he makes take-it-or-leave-it de-
mands, and that is it. We need to come 
together and come to agreement that 
will not satisfy any one of us com-
pletely but gets the job done. I hope 
that as we get closer to the end of the 
year, partisan posturing on the Repub-
lican side will give way to some gen-
uine compromises. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NOMINEES 
Madam President, now, on another 
matter. 
President-Elect 
Biden 
con-
tinues to roll out an impressive slate of 
candidates he intends to nominate to 
his Cabinet and other key administra-
tive positions. They provide an incred-
ibly stark contrast to the caliber of the 
nominees the Senate considered over 
the past 4 years. Not only are Presi-
dent-Elect Biden’s nominees exception-
ally qualified and familiar with the in-
stitutions to which they are nomi-
nated, but they have a broad range of 
backgrounds and experiences. They ac-
tually look like America. 
Today, I will be meeting with Presi-
dent-Elect Biden’s intended Secretary 
of State, Tony Blinken, and his in-
tended Director of National Intel-
ligence, Avril Haines, who is the first 
woman to be nominated to serve in 
that position. Like most Americans are 
doing these days, our ‘‘meeting’’ will 
take place over a video chat, and I am 
looking forward to asking both Mr. 
Blinken and Ms. Haines about their 
views on a range of issues concerning 
American diplomacy, foreign policy, 
and national security, and how to re-
pair some of the damage to America’s 
reputation and relationships abroad 
done by the past administration. 
Now, after what all we went through 
over the past 4 years, I would expect 
that almost all of President-Elect 
Biden’s nominees would be widely ac-
ceptable to the Senate. After all, Sen-
ate 
Republicans 
confirmed 
several 
Trump nominees who lacked the nec-
essary qualifications, who were mired 
in ethics scandals, and who made out-
rageous and inflammatory comments 
in the past. 
Republican Senators often argued 
that a President deserves broad def-
erence when it comes to their Cabinet 
and official appointments and blew 
past controversies that would in al-
most any other time be disqualifying. 
President-Elect Biden’s nominees, of 
course, are in a different universe. 
Well, we are already starting to see 
the switch start to flip now that Presi-
dent-Elect Biden is the one naming the 
names. To take just one example, Sen-
ate Republicans reacted to the historic 
nomination of Neera Tanden to run the 
Office of Management and Budget by 
calling her ‘‘radioactive,’’ a ‘‘nutjob,’’ 
and expressing alarm over some crit-
ical tweets in the past. 
After spending 4 years pretending 
they didn’t see the latest insane tweet 
from President Trump, Senate Repub-
licans seem to have found a newfound 
interest in the Twitter feeds of Biden’s 
Cabinet selections. 
With respect to the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget specifically, Senate 
Republicans lined up to confirm the 
previous 
OMB 
Director, 
Russell 
Vought, after he was at the heart of 
the scandal that led to President 
Trump’s impeachment: withholding se-
curity aid to an ally at war, Ukraine. 
If Senate Republicans are worried 
about someone with a partisan back-
ground in OMB, perhaps they shouldn’t 
have voted to confirm Russell Vought, 
who used to work not just at the Herit-
age Foundation but for its partisan ad-
vocacy arm. If Senate Republicans are 
concerned about someone who made 
controversial comments running OMB, 
perhaps they shouldn’t have confirmed 
Russell Vought, who once said: ‘‘Mus-
lims do not simply have a deficient 
theology. They do not know God be-
cause they have rejected Jesus Christ 
his Son, and they stand condemned.’’ 
That was the previous OMB Director 
condemning an entire religion. The Re-
publican majority confirmed him de-
spite these inflammatory comments, 
despite his conduct as interim Direc-
tor, and despite his career as a partisan 
warrior. 
But a few critical tweets about sub-
stantive policy positions have caused 
Senate 
Republicans 
to 
label 
Ms. 
Tanden’s 
nomination 
‘‘radioactive.’’ 
Spare us the hyperbole. Ms. Tanden, we 
all know, is an eminently qualified 
nominee who would be the first woman 
of color to ever run the Office of Man-
agement and Budget. 
As Biden continues to name his 
team, I am sure we will hear some 
more of these overblown complaints 
from Republican Senators, but after 
the caliber of nominees that this Re-
publican majority confirmed over the 
past 4 years, it will be impossible—im-
possible—to take them seriously. 
The Senate committees should pre-
pare to hold hearings on President- 
Elect Biden’s nominees in January, im-
mediately after the Georgia elections. 
Let me say that again. The Senate 
committees should prepare to hold 
hearings on President-Elect Biden’s 
nominees 
in 
January, 
immediately 
after the Georgia elections. 
That is customary for a new Presi-
dent. The Senate holds several hear-
ings in January so that key Cabinet of-
ficials can be confirmed on January 20 
and shortly thereafter. That is what 
the Senate did for President Trump 
and President Obama. That is what the 
Senate must do for President-Elect 
Biden as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, yes-
terday drugmaker Moderna filed for an 
emergency use authorization from the 
FDA for its COVID vaccine. The FDA’s 
Vaccine Advisory Committee is sched-
uled to discuss Pfizer’s COVID vaccine 
next week and is expected to review 
Moderna’s shortly thereafter. 
That means that it is entirely pos-
sible that by the end of December the 
FDA will have authorized not one but 
two COVID vaccines that have so far 
shown more than 90 percent effective-
ness in preventing the disease. This is 
very hopeful news, and it is a tribute to 
the innovative power of the private 
sector and the efforts of Congress and 
the Trump administration to expedite 
the development of COVID vaccines. 
The light at the end of the tunnel 
looks like it is on the way. At the same 
time, it is essential that we not mini-
mize what is happening with COVID 
right now. Cases are surging and are 
likely to surge further, and doctors and 
hospitals are struggling. 
It is essential that we maintain key 
safety measures until those vaccines 
arrive. Now, more than ever, we need 
to keep wearing masks, wash our 
hands, and maintain social distance. 
The more responsibly we act, the more 
we can protect vulnerable members of 
the population and keep our doctors 
and hospitals from being overrun. Act-
ing responsibly can also help avert fur-
ther economic shutdowns, which would

December 1, 2020 
be a devastating blow to a lot of strug-
gling businesses. 
I know that it has been a long, hard 
year and that everyone is tired of the 
additional safety measures we have had 
to take, but the beginning of the end is 
in sight, and we need to hold on for a 
few months longer and keep doing ev-
erything we can to prevent further 
virus spread. 
At the same time, it is important 
that State and local governments use 
their authority responsibly and think 
carefully about the impact of the 
health and safety measures that they 
are putting in place. It is also essential 
that elected officials ensure that they 
are 
respecting 
our 
constitutional 
rights—notably, the right of assembly 
and the free exercise of religion—when 
imposing coronavirus restrictions. 
I was pleased to see the Supreme 
Court uphold this principle in its re-
cent decision suspending draconian 
New York measures targeting houses of 
worship. New York City is not the only 
place where churches have faced dis-
proportionately 
strict 
restrictions. 
Earlier this year in Washington, DC, 
for example, the mayor celebrated 
mass protests that vastly exceeded rec-
ommendations for gathering size, even 
as she maintained strict restrictions on 
houses of worship. 
I was pleased to join an amicus brief 
to the DC district court in support of 
Capitol Hill Baptist Church’s lawsuit 
against the DC government asking that 
the church’s constitutional right to 
free exercise of its faith be respected in 
the same way as the protesters’ rights 
to freedom of speech. 
Throughout this pandemic we have, 
unfortunately, seen a significant de-
gree of hypocrisy from many on the 
left who have called for or imposed 
strict restrictions on activities that 
they deem nonessential while cele-
brating activities that they approved 
of but that posed a significant risk of 
coronavirus transmission. 
The First Amendment cannot be ap-
plied selectively, and when imposing 
coronavirus 
restrictions, 
lawmakers 
need to exercise the greatest respect 
for our first freedom—the free exercise 
of religion—and ensure that churches 
are not subjected to disproportionately 
severe measures. 
More than that, politicians should do 
everything that they can to ensure 
that religious worship is supported as 
far as possible during the pandemic. 
Worship is an essential activity, and it 
should be accorded the same respect 
and deference that governments have 
accorded to liquor stores, bike shops, 
and nail salons. 
In the next couple of weeks, Congress 
will be passing key legislation, includ-
ing a bill to fund the government. I am 
hoping that we will be able to add a 
COVID relief bill to that list. While the 
money Congress has already invested 
in COVID relief has gone a long way to-
ward meeting the country’s needs, 
there is more that we need to do. 
Republicans put forward an addi-
tional targeted relief package months 
ago, but Democrats spent the fall de-
laying additional COVID relief by in-
sisting on bloated legislation filled 
with unrelated and unreasonable de-
mands. It has been impossible to nego-
tiate with Democrats for the simple 
reason that Democrats have made it 
clear that compromise is not an option. 
‘‘It is our way or the highway,’’ Demo-
crats have said. It is either a multitril-
lion-dollar bill or nothing at all. 
Democrats have to know that they 
don’t have a chance of getting their 
bill through both houses of Congress 
and to the President’s desk, so the rea-
sonable thing for them to do, if they 
really want to help Americans, would 
be to work with Republicans to pass a 
bill that delivers at least some of what 
they want. Republicans and Democrats 
agree on a number of things, from more 
money for schools, testing, and vac-
cines to another round of Paycheck 
Protection Program relief for the hard-
est hit small businesses. 
We should be able to arrive at com-
promise legislation that both sides can 
agree to, and we should pass that com-
promise legislation before the end of 
the year. I was encouraged to hear that 
a few Democrats are looking to develop 
bipartisan coronavirus legislation, and 
I hope we will be able to convince the 
Speaker and the Democratic leader 
here in the Senate that working with 
Republicans—really 
working 
with 
them—and not pretending to negotiate 
while refusing to actually compromise 
is the right thing to do for the Amer-
ican people. 
It has been a rough year for the coun-
try. Let’s close it out by working to-
gether to deliver the additional relief 
that Americans need to weather the 
rest of this pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how 
bad is the COVID–19 pandemic? I am 
sure we each look at it in personal and 
family terms. 
We have just gone through a Thanks-
giving like no other, for my family and 
for many others who decided that safe-
ty was more important than being 
physically in the same room with the 
family members we love. So we turned 
to FaceTime, Zoom, and every other 
contrivance we could find to maintain 
a connection with children, grand-
children, and other people we love. 
But the situation is dire. The infec-
tion and death rate in my home State 
has been heartbreaking in terms of the 
number of people who have had their 
lives changed, and some have had their 
lives ended because of it. 
I can use one example of how bad it 
is. It won’t mean much to those who 
are listening. The city of St. Louis is a 
large metropolitan area—millions of 
people. I grew up nearby on the Illinois 
side of the river. One day last week the 
St. Louis hospitals were unable to take 
a COVID–19 patient, and, as a result, 
that patient was transported almost 
100 miles away to Quincy, IL, to a hos-
pital so the patient could receive the 
care that they needed. Think of that: 
not an available space in the city of St. 
Louis. 
Last month a dear friend of mine, 
feeling ill, who lived in Illinois, went 
over to the St. Louis area and went to 
one of the most outstanding hospitals 
in the city. She was told she couldn’t 
be admitted because there was no room 
for her. She went to the second most 
reputable hospital in the city with the 
same report. Finally, with the third 
try, she was admitted to another hos-
pital. Three days later she passed 
away. In a desperate situation, she was 
turned away from two major hospitals 
because they didn’t have room. 
So we can argue long and hard about 
the danger of this COVID–19, whether it 
is something to take seriously or not— 
and there are still those who insist it is 
not—but we can’t escape the reality 
that 131⁄2 million Americans have al-
ready been infected with the COVID 
virus and over 267,000 American lives 
have been lost. 
My heart goes out to those families 
and their loved ones, some of whom 
were my friends—and one very close 
friend—who have lost their lives. And 
for all of those who are fighting 
COVID–19 today, including Members of 
Congress, I wish them well, Godspeed. 
Get well and come back and join us in 
a positive way. 
As the number of infected Americans 
continues to rise, it is vital that we 
continue to take safety precautions: 
social distancing, wearing masks, and 
staying home as much as possible. 
I am worried about the health and 
safety of our country, but I am also 
worried about the millions of Ameri-
cans who find themselves in dire 
straits as the economic impact of this 
pandemic lingers. I think of some of 
the restaurants in Chicago and in my 
own hometown that I visited with my 
wife from time to time. They are gone. 
They are not going to return. 
Sadly, every day, decisions are being 
made by businesses just like those that 
they just can’t continue to lose money. 
It clearly is a call to action for Con-
gress to do something. 
Some choose to focus on the status of 
the stock market indexes and monthly 
job reports as proof that the economy 
has recovered. In fact, I met with a 
group of Senators from the other side 
of the aisle who said it is the dominant 
opinion of the majority of Republican 
Senators that we don’t need a stim-
ulus; that we have recovered; we are on 
our way. I don’t see it that way at all. 
I think we clearly need to bring life 
into this economy that reaches fami-
lies, neighborhoods, communities, and 
towns. 
The Wall Street Journal and the Dow 
Jones average are interesting to read, 
but for most Americans, it is not part 
of their regular life experience; it is 
just a question about whether or not 
they can keep their family-owned busi-
ness open or whether or not that store 
or that restaurant they always valued

December 1, 2020 
as part of their community is gone for-
ever. 
We know the stock market or a sin-
gle jobs report are not reliable meas-
ures of the economy’s overall health. 
The fact is, too many Americans are 
still living life on the brink. Look at 
the long lines of people in their cars 
waiting for food, spending hours of 
their day trying to get a donation of 
food. Some of them are embarrassed by 
the experience, though they should not 
be. It reflects the reality of what life is 
like for many people who just a short 
time ago were volunteers at that same 
food bank or contributed to it. They 
are waiting anxiously for relief and 
wondering if Congress even knows it. 
We set a record of 88,000 Americans 
hospitalized last Tuesday, a week ago. 
One-quarter of our hospitals are report-
ing critical shortages of doctors and 
nurses who have been fatigued with 
months on the frontlines. I can’t help 
but be personally moved by these doc-
tors and nurses who stand before us 
and talk about what it is like to be in 
that emergency room day after day 
after day. These are rock-solid profes-
sionals who have given their life to the 
medical profession. How many times 
have we watched them break down in 
tears as they tell us what they are 
going through? You talk about the 
emotional stress that we face, the de-
pression we face having to stay home 
and away from our friends and family. 
Think about what they face every sin-
gle day, plus the danger to their own 
personal health and the danger to their 
families that is part of this. It really 
begs for us to take this much more se-
riously here on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate. 
In the weeks leading up to Thanks-
giving, 1 in 8 Americans—126 million— 
didn’t have enough to eat. Millions of 
Americans are claiming some form of 
unemployment insurance. If we do 
nothing—if we do nothing—in the Sen-
ate, other than to act on the Executive 
Calendar, which the Republican leader 
referred to this morning, the day after 
Christmas, 12 million Americans will 
be cut off entirely from unemployment 
assistance—12 million. If we don’t do 
something, those families will be in a 
desperate situation. 
If Congress fails to act, that day is 
going to be an ominous, dark day in 
our history. The issues facing our 
State and local governments, which are 
at the forefront of combating this cri-
sis, continue to be a priority. Their 
budgets are being hammered by shrink-
ing revenues, and without additional 
aid, many will have no choice but to ei-
ther cut important services that many 
rely upon or raise taxes on families al-
ready hard-hit. 
We must take action to protect our 
State and local government workers, 
the firefighters, the teachers, the first 
responders. In the coming weeks, as 
many as 30 million Americans are fac-
ing the risk of eviction without addi-
tional help. Merry Christmas. You have 
been evicted. 
Just a few weeks ago, nearly 12 mil-
lion Americans indicated they would be 
unable to pay their rent or mortgage in 
December. Where will they go? Housing 
assistance that helps keep families in 
their homes during this public health 
crisis, as we move into winter months, 
has to be a top priority. 
For those who are saying that we are 
out of the woods, we don’t need a stim-
ulus, look at those numbers on the Dow 
Jones index—I ask you to tell that to 
20 million Americans receiving unem-
ployment today or the countless small 
businesses that are facing closure. 
There is still a lot of hurt out there, 
and we need to get more relief out to 
those who need it. News of the COVID 
vaccine development is promising, but 
we are many months from building up 
the immunity that we need. In the 
meantime, we must confront the virus 
with investments in testing, tracing, 
and healthcare. 
I want to, at this point, say a word 
about an effort that was announced 
this morning that I have been part of 
for several weeks. There is a bipartisan 
group of Senators in Congress who 
have been talking about the very issues 
that I raised in this speech. I can’t tell 
you how many hours they put into it. 
We have a group of eight Senators— 
four Democrats and four Republicans 
on this side of the Rotunda and a simi-
lar group on the other side of House 
Members—who have been trying to find 
a bipartisan path out of this current 
situation. I want to salute them. On 
the Democratic side, I want to thank 
MARK
WARNER
of 
Virginia, 
JOE 
MANCHIN of West Virginia, and JEANNE 
SHAHEEN
of New Hampshire. It has 
been my honor to sit at tables on Zoom 
calls hour after hour after hour as we 
hash through some of the difficult 
choices that need to be made. On the 
Republican side, I want to thank SUSAN 
COLLINS, LISA MURKOWSKI, BILL CAS-
SIDY, and MITT ROMNEY. They have put 
as much time as I have, and many 
times more, in this effort to bring us to 
a point where we can offer a solution. 
They announced this morning that 
they have come to a conclusion that 
the spending part of this is going to be 
manageable—doable—on a bipartisan 
basis, and it should be called on the 
floor for passage. I will tell you that 
the $908 billion package they put to-
gether is not what I wanted. I believe 
there should be dramatically larger 
amounts put into this effort. But there 
are some on the other side of the aisle 
who believe that little or nothing is 
needed. They have tried to find a mid-
dle ground, and I believe they have 
with the $908 billion. The way it is allo-
cated across the board in a draft frame-
work hits the major elements that we 
need to act on before we go home for 
Christmas in this month of December. 
I am not happy with a lot of these fig-
ures, but that is what it is all about in 
this world of the U.S. Congress: You 
come together willing to sit down and 
listen to the other side and, if nec-
essary, compromise, so at the end of 
the day, you have something to show 
for your efforts. 
The reason I didn’t participate in the 
press conference this morning is be-
cause at the very end, an issue came 
up, which I believe is really so impor-
tant, that has to be resolved and re-
solved fairly, and that is the issue of 
immunity from liability. Many of us 
believe that businesses—most busi-
nesses—are doing everything they can 
think of to keep their employees and 
their customers as safe as possible, and 
I salute them for it. But many of them 
as well believe that we need to have 
standards that they can live up to, so if 
they are ever challenged by an em-
ployee, by a customer, or even in court, 
they can turn to a standard of care and 
point that they did everything they 
could be expected to do at that mo-
ment in time. 
I believe that is a good defense and 
always has been to any accusations of 
wrongdoing. But there are some who 
believe that there should be a different 
standard, an unreasonable standard— 
one that I think goes too far in pro-
viding immunity from liability, not 
just for good businesses but also for 
those that are not. And there are some. 
We need to have the courts available 
for those who have been treated badly. 
I think of the meat processing plants 
and some of the activities that were in-
volved in the earliest stages, where the 
employees didn’t receive the basic pro-
tection they needed. They came down 
with the COVID virus, and many had 
serious consequences in their lives. I 
believe they deserve a day in court. 
I want to make sure that we pass this 
COVID–19 
bill, 
as 
the 
group 
has 
brought together or something like it, 
for $908 billion. We shouldn’t be de-
layed or diverted from this effort by a 
debate over immunity from liability. It 
is an important issue, but some 38 
States have already adapted their laws 
relating to COVID–19 liability. The 
others can certainly do it, if they wish, 
if they think they need it. That has re-
sulted in some things which are worth 
reporting. 
We are told that there is a tsunami of 
COVID–19 
lawsuits 
that 
are 
being 
brought against individuals and busi-
nesses. It turns out that nothing could 
be further from the truth. There is a 
law firm known as Hunton Andrews 
Kurth that monitors all lawsuits that 
are filed in the United States every 
day. They have sought out how many 
lawsuits relate to COVID–19 and the 
coronavirus. Last week’s report is this: 
Out of the some 121⁄2
to 13 million 
Americans who have been infected with 
the COVID virus, only 6,273 lawsuits 
have been brought in the entire Nation 
in the year 2020 that mention the term 
COVID–19 or coronavirus. Well, you 
think: Boy, that is a lot of lawsuits to 
be filed against doctors and nurses and 
hospitals. Let me tell you, out of the 
total number, 6,000 lawsuits, only 10— 
10—nationwide have been filed for mal-
practice claims, medical malpractice 
claims—10 lawsuits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7122 
December 1, 2020 
To argue that we ought to close the 
doors of the court to people who are 
seeking relief, when so few lawsuits 
have been filed, makes no sense at all. 
How many personal injury suits? How 
many people have sued some person or 
entity or business saying, ‘‘On your 
premises, I contracted this COVID–19’’? 
Well, out of 13 million who have been 
infected, you would think the number 
would be enormous. Twenty-two—that 
is the number—twenty-two personal in-
jury lawsuits have been filed. One hun-
dred and ten of these additional law-
suits have been filed by employees for 
workplace situations. Out of all these 
lawsuits in the United States of Amer-
ica for malpractice, personal injury, 
and workplace complaints, there are 
142 lawsuits nationwide. Why would we 
hold up the $908 billion economic relief 
over this phenomena? Do you want to 
know where most of the lawsuits are 
being filed? Most of the lawsuits are 
being filed between businesses, as well 
as businesses versus their insurance 
companies, and prisoners who are peti-
tioning the court for release from what 
they consider to be dangerous cir-
cumstances. Those are the lawsuits 
that make up the bulk of the cases 
that have been filed so far. 
There is no tsunami of lawsuits. The 
States are handling this matter respon-
sibly and effectively, and there is no 
indication that our tort system in this 
country 
needs 
to 
be 
dramatically 
changed. That is why I really withheld 
my attendance this morning at this 
press conference. The group has not 
agreed on the basic issue of liability, 
but there were statements being made 
that I could not agree with that I 
didn’t want to suggest that I did, and 
that is why I didn’t attend. I am still 
ready to work on it. I want to work on 
it and find a bipartisan way to protect 
the rights of individuals who have been 
wronged for their day in court, not to 
extinguish or take away any rights 
from any people, to acknowledge that 
States have made decisions on COVID– 
19 and are moving forward and are 
doing a very fine job, as those numbers 
indicate. 
Let us not make the best the enemy 
of the good. For those Republicans who 
believe that the Cornyn bill on liabil-
ity is an essential part of this package, 
do not deny unemployment insurance 
and help to small businesses across 
America because we need to fight out 
this battle. If the Democrats had in-
sisted that we would have no COVID–19 
bill unless we had minimum-wage leg-
islation or family leave related to eco-
nomic circumstances, you would say: 
Why don’t you save that debate for an-
other day? We don’t need it at this mo-
ment. We do need it as a nation but not 
at this moment. At this moment, we 
need to pass emergency assistance to 
the families and businesses across 
America. 
I salute my friends who are part of 
this effort, this bipartisan effort. I am 
glad that I spent the time that I did, 
and I am still ready to work some 
more. We can come to a conclusion, 
and we must. 
For the U.S. Senate to finish this 
month without dealing with this very 
basic COVID–19 relief package is fun-
damentally wrong. It is the highest pri-
ority for families and businesses across 
America, and we owe them nothing 
less. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Kyle Hauptman, of Maine, to 
be a Member of the National Credit 
Union Administration Board for a term 
expiring August 2, 2025. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

NOMINATION OF KYLE HAUPTMAN 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, the 
Senate has just voted to conclude de-
bate 
on 
the 
nomination 
of 
Kyle 
Hauptman to be on the Board of the 
National Credit Union Administration, 
and we will soon vote to confirm Mr. 
Hauptman to the administration. 
This is a very happy moment, of 
course, for Kyle and his family and the 
country. For me, I have to confess it is 
something of a bittersweet moment. 
That is because Kyle is not only a 
nominee to a Federal Board. Mind you, 
he is my trusted economic adviser; he 
is the staff director for me on the Eco-
nomic Policy Subcommittee of the 
Senate Banking Committee; and he is a 
good friend. 
So while I voted to confirm Kyle with 
enthusiasm, my enthusiasm is mixed 
with sadness to see a close and trusted 
aide go. But my loss will be America’s 
gain. The NCUA, American taxpayers, 
and millions of people who rely on 
credit unions will be well served by 
Kyle, who brings to the job a collegial 
spirit and rare knowledge of financial 
markets. 
Kyle’s expertise comes from years of 
work for the bipartisan SEC Advisory 
Committee and on Wall Street itself, 
where he focused on the very same 
money markets where credit unions ob-
tain their financing. Lest anyone think 
that Kyle doesn’t understand what 
struggling American families can face, 
as an analyst on the Asia desk at Leh-
man Brothers, Kyle lost his job and his 
savings during the financial crisis, 
which means he has a deep and gut- 
level understanding about how deci-
sions made by bankers and bureaucrats 
at the top can have serious con-
sequences for everyone else. 
Kyle has put this knowledge of the 
banking system and its implications to 
excellent use as my top aide. He has 
provided invaluable counsel and shep-
herded legislation through Congress on 
topics as wide-ranging as money laun-
dering, consumer fraud, and blockchain 
technology. In fact, I have high hopes 
that an anti-money laundering bill on 
which Kyle and I worked for months, 
the ILLICIT CASH Act, will pass this 
Congress before the year is through. 
That is not all Kyle has accom-
plished. As a top committee aide, he 
has worked diligently to plan hearings 
and broker compromises with other 
Senators’ staff. As anyone who knows 
Kyle can attest, he is a friendly and 
fast-talking guy, always ready with a 
joke and a smile, and his congeniality 
has helped smooth over many partisan 
spats so that the business of the Amer-
ican people can move forward. 
As important, Kyle has served as a 
valuable liaison between me and credit 
unions 
in 
Arkansas 
and 
the 
sur-
rounding States. Though most credit 
unions in Arkansas are very small, 
with maybe millions of dollars under 
management—not billions of dollars— 
what our credit unions lack in size 
they make up for in their mission. 
They exist not for profit but to serve 
their members by keeping their money 
safe and providing credit at reasonable 
rates of return. 
So while our credit unions may not 
always manage vast fortunes, they do 
manage vast dreams. They safeguard 
the savings and extend opportunity to 
a customer base in Arkansas that looks 
an awful lot like the rest of America— 
senior citizens who have used the same 
banks for decades, for instance, or 
young families building a foundation 
for a better life. 
Kyle is very well acquainted with 
these credit unions from his work for 
me in the Banking Committee, but you 
don’t have to take my word for it. Just 
listen to the Arkansas Credit Union 
Association, which submitted a letter 
in support of Kyle’s nomination. I will 
quote from it here at length. This is 
from the group’s executive director: 
On behalf of the Arkansas Credit Union As-
sociation, I’ll say that we probably feel the 
same way you do—that he’ll be difficult to 
replace yet the NCUA is lucky to have him. 
I’ve gone to Washington for a couple dec-
ades now on behalf of Arkansas credit 
unions, most of which are very small, rural 
institutions. Our largest credit union has 
just over $1 billion in assets, which would be 
considered small even by community-bank 
standards. The rest are much smaller, where 
you can count on one hand the number of 
ATMs they have. While advocating for these 
community-based lenders, I’ve encountered a 
lot of Congressional staffers. Kyle is the best 
I’ve dealt with. 
Given his background at large, inter-
national finance firms, you might think Kyle 
wouldn’t understand the needs of our mem-
bers, who are mostly low- or moderate-in-
come families. Yet it’s quite the opposite: he 
has gone above and beyond to listen, respond 
quickly and empathize with our concerns. 
His knowledge of financial markets is an 
asset, not a liability. 
I’m aware that NCUA board members 
aren’t like Senate staffers; I’ll no longer be 
a constituent but rather someone working 
for the institutions Kyle will be regulating. 
But I think you’ll agree that he’ll continue 
to be fair, professional and serious about his 
work. 
I can tell you I very much do agree 
with every word of that letter and 
similar letters we have received about 
Kyle and his work on behalf of Arkan-
sans. 
Washington can sometimes be a con-
fusing place, so Kyle’s assistance keep-
ing Arkansans in the loop has been a 
great blessing to many of the people we 
serve. I remember the countless emails 
from small business owners praising 
Kyle for his help in understanding and 
receiving 
assistance 
through 
the 
CARES Act in March, April, and May, 
at the height of the danger and the un-
certainty about the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
That was all Kyle, and I am confident 
he will bring the same customer serv-
ice mentality to his work at the NCUA. 
That is because Kyle, like the credit 
unions he will regulate, is driven by a 
sense of mission: to help his fellow 
Americans 
achieve 
their 
financial 
goals and the American dream. That 
dream is based on freedom. 
Alongside his hero, the great apostle 
of 
opportunity, 
Jack 
Kemp, 
Kyle 
knows ‘‘there are no limits to what 
free men and women and free enter-
prise in a free society can accomplish 
when [men and women] are free to fol-
low their dream.’’ 
Credit 
unions 
allow 
millions 
of 
Americans to follow their dreams. So 
while I am sad to say farewell to Kyle 
as a trusted aide, I will take consola-
tion in the fact that he is going to 
serve our fellow Americans in the 
cause of freedom, and I know that he 
will serve them well. Thank you, Kyle, 
and Godspeed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CARES ACT FUNDING 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
rise this afternoon because while we 
were away for our Thanksgiving break, 
there were some very important devel-
opments on an important piece of leg-
islation that we passed earlier this 
year, the CARES Act. Specifically, 
what I am referring to is the decision 
that was made by the Treasury Sec-
retary, Secretary Mnuchin, to not ex-
tend the 13(3) lending facilities that we 
dramatically expanded in the CARES 
Act. 
By way of reminder, let me summa-
rize these facilities. When the economy 
first began to close down back in 
March-April, one of the things that 
started to happen was a collapse of our 
credit markets. I will get into that in 
a little bit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7125 
December 1, 2020 
In response to that, we in Congress 
passed the CARES Act, which, among 
other things, appropriated just under 
half a trillion dollars—$500 billion—for 
the Treasury to use to capitalize spe-
cial purpose vehicles, which would be 
set up as entities from which the Fed-
eral Reserve would lend money, buy se-
curities, and provide liquidity to the 
marketplace. 
Those 
facilities 
were 
scheduled to end by the end of the 
year. 
In keeping with the written statute 
and certainly the intent of Congress, 
Secretary Mnuchin announced that 
these programs will, in fact, end as 
they are supposed to. I commend him 
for making the right decision, and I 
commend Chairman Powell for agree-
ing to a subsequent request from the 
Treasury Secretary to return the un-
used money. 
As it happened, the program, the con-
cept, worked so well that the mere an-
nouncement and the mere creation of 
the capability on the part of the Fed to 
provide this liquidity was enough to re-
store functioning capital markets. 
It was an extraordinary amount of 
trust that we put in both Treasury Sec-
retary Mnuchin and Chairman Powell, 
giving them extremely powerful, un-
precedented emergency and temporary 
tools. I commend them both for work-
ing together with those tools, for 
achieving the intended purpose, and for 
putting them away once the purpose 
had been achieved. 
Some of our Democratic colleagues 
have been extremely critical of this de-
cision 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Secretary 
Mnuchin not to extend these programs. 
I want to address some of the argu-
ments and why Secretary Mnuchin, in 
fact, did exactly the right thing. 
Let’s go back and take a hard look at 
what we were facing in March of 2020. 
Unprecedented turmoil in the credit 
markets were threatening the ability 
of virtually every business, State, and 
municipality in America to obtain 
credit—a real threat to the financial 
plumbing, so to speak, of our entire 
economy. Credit markets were on the 
verge of shutting down. There was a 
mass flight of investors out of any kind 
of financial instrument and into cash. 
People were trying to sell everything 
they had. Prices were dropping in a 
free fall. In many instances, there was 
no buyer; there was no price at which 
one 
could 
sell 
an 
investment. 
Of 
course, that meant that a borrower 
couldn’t sell a bond or couldn’t issue a 
commercial paper. This was the freeze- 
up in our financial markets that we 
were right on the verge of, and we were 
very desperately afraid that, if this 
happened—if our financial markets 
came to a grinding halt and you could 
neither borrow nor lend either in the 
capital markets or in the private lend-
ing markets of banks—then that would 
almost assuredly accelerate the down-
ward spiral of our economy and could 
even lead to a severe depression that 
could last, potentially, a very long 
time. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it. A very well-stated summary of what 
was 
happening 
comes 
from 
Kent 
Hiteshew, who was the Deputy Assist-
ant Director for Financial Stability at 
the Federal Reserve. He was a senior 
executive at the Federal Reserve, who, 
in his testimony before the congres-
sional oversight committee, had this to 
say: 
The 
conditions 
that 
prevailed 
during 
March were unprecedented—far worse than 
during the onset of the financial crisis in 
late 2008 or even in the days after 9/11, when 
the municipal market was briefly closed. In-
terest rates soared . . . mutual fund inves-
tors pulled over $41 billion of assets out of 
the market in less than three weeks, and 
market functioning deteriorated to the point 
that buyers and sellers had difficulty deter-
mining prices. Ultimately, this meant that 
state and local governments were effectively 
unable to borrow, with most new issues can-
celed for lack of investor demand. 
That was the problem that Congress 
was seeking to address—a complete 
freezing up of our capital markets, the 
inability to borrow or lend. That is the 
lifeblood of business, which is the 
source of employment in this country. 
If we had not done anything at that 
moment, who knows how many more 
millions of Americans would have lost 
their jobs or how many more millions 
of businesses would have gone under. 
The economic devastation would have 
been very, very hard to imagine had we 
not done anything. Fortunately, we did 
do something. 
Congress decided that this problem 
could be fixed by providing enough li-
quidity until the crisis had passed. We 
would make sure that operations of 
this liquidity exercise would extend no 
later than through the end of 2020, and 
that is what we did in the CARES Act. 
Just last week, every Republican mem-
ber of the Senate Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs sent a 
letter to Secretary Mnuchin and Sec-
retary Powell that reaffirmed that this 
was Congress’s intent—a short-term, 
temporary facility to restore func-
tioning private markets. 
I am pleased to report that these 
emergency 
facilities 
absolutely 
achieved the intended purpose—again, 
the purpose to stabilize our credit mar-
kets, restore the normal flow of credit 
to borrowers, and allow private capital 
to continue to resume funding our 
economy. It worked even better than 
we had hoped. Markets didn’t just im-
prove, and we didn’t just see liquidity 
return; we saw record volumes of new 
debt issuance, new investor interest, 
municipal bonds, investment grade cor-
porate 
bonds, 
high-yield 
corporate 
bonds—volumes that were off the chart 
in response to these facilities. The 
credit spreads at which these instru-
ments were issued were very tight, and 
interest rates were near a record low. 
On the banking side, regional banks 
reported that their commercial bor-
rowers drew down lines of credit so 
that they had the cash they would need 
to get through a very difficult period. 
In fact, many of them have been able 
to start paying that cash back. Accord-
ing to various surveys of businesses 
across America, unmet demand for 
credit among creditworthy borrowers 
is almost nonexistent. In other words, 
as to the creditworthy corporate bor-
rowers—businesses large and small in 
America—if their credit is strong, they 
are able to access the facilities they 
need, the credit they need. That is ex-
actly what we had hoped would happen 
by virtue of setting up these facilities. 
Despite that, some have said that we 
can’t end these facilities that are 
called the 13(3) facilities because that 
is a section of existing law under which 
the Fed is authorized to conduct these 
activities. People have suggested: Well, 
you can’t end these because the mar-
kets depend on them for their normal, 
smooth functioning. The markets now 
depend on these facilities. That was 
what we were told as a reason the 
Treasury had to extend these, presum-
ably indefinitely, but, in fact, what we 
saw proved that the naysayers were 
completely wrong. 
In fact, it was on November 19 that 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Mnuchin 
an-
nounced that he would not be extend-
ing these programs. How did these fi-
nancial markets respond? With a yawn. 
There were no adverse developments 
whatsoever. 
They 
continued 
their 
smooth, liquid functioning because, by 
November 19—in fact, many months 
prior to November 19—the markets had 
recovered on their own. They were 
functioning on their own. They were no 
longer in need of this fallback facility 
that we had created. Yet we did need it 
back in March. Equity markets have 
hit all-time record highs. Municipal 
debt and corporate debt volume is very 
high, and yields are low. The market is 
functioning very, very smoothly. Clear-
ly, those of us who were advocating for 
actually following the law and ending 
these programs were right in that the 
markets were not actually depending 
on them anymore. 
Other 
people 
have 
said: 
You 
shouldn’t end the 13(3) facilities for 
other reasons, one of which was, Who 
knows what risks may be out there or 
what bad things might be on the hori-
zon for our economy that would cause 
us to want to have these facilities? 
That is a very bad reason for giving in-
definite lending authority to the Fed 
to make direct loans to businesses in 
America. 
First of all, there has never been a 
day in the history of the Republic that 
you couldn’t imagine some bad thing 
that could possibly happen on the hori-
zon. That is no reason to create a tax-
payer-sponsored backstop for all finan-
cial activity—none whatsoever. Sure, a 
bad thing could happen. Nobody knows. 
If it does, there is an answer. If such a 
disaster were to occur in the future and 
our financial markets were in danger 
once again of freezing up, then the Fed 
and Treasury should come back to Con-
gress and ask for whatever authority 
they think is appropriate for those cir-
cumstances. Based on what we did in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7126 
December 1, 2020 
March, Congress is quite likely to re-
spond by granting the tools necessary 
to deal with whatever hypothetical cri-
sis may emerge down the road. 
Others of our friends say: You can’t 
get rid of these facilities, and you can’t 
terminate 
these 
facilities 
because 
there are industries that are failing in 
America. Let me be clear. It is true 
that there are industries that are in a 
world of hurt. We know what they are. 
The travel industry—much of the tour-
ism and hospitality, which is generally 
the hotels and restaurants—and a lot of 
the entertainment venues have been 
devastated like we have never seen 
them before. That is a true fact. 
I think you can make a strong argu-
ment that Congress ought to do some-
thing to respond to the circumstances 
that these folks find themselves in 
through no fault of their own, but they 
are in the situation they are in be-
cause, in many cases, their Governors 
closed their States. In other cases, it is 
because people are just prudently con-
cerned about being in a crowded set-
ting. So there is a problem there— 
there is a challenge—and we may very 
well decide we want to address it. Yet 
having the Federal Reserve lending 
money 
to 
fundamentally 
insolvent 
companies is not the role of these fa-
cilities. It never was. It is not con-
templated in the underlying 13(3) stat-
ute, and it is not in the CARES Act. 
That is not what this program, what 
these facilities were meant to address. 
Let’s be clear about what the advo-
cates for continuing these 13(3) facili-
ties are really all about. What is going 
on here with regard to these pro-
grams—this massive, massive amount 
of money that is at the discretion of 
the Fed and the Treasury to lend—is 
they want to use political pressure on 
the Fed and the Treasury to lend these 
facilities to favored political constitu-
encies at terms they find appealing or 
attractive 
depending 
on 
their 
cir-
cumstances. This is exactly the oppo-
site of what a central bank should be 
doing—capitulating to political pres-
sure to lend to preferred constituents 
at whatever terms the politics dictate. 
That could not be anything further 
from the role the central bank ought to 
be playing. 
To my colleagues who are advocating 
that we do exactly that with these 13(3) 
facilities, I couldn’t disagree more. If 
we want to be in the business of pick-
ing industries or sectors and sub-
sidizing them or giving them money or 
treating them in some unusual way, we 
can have that discussion, but that is 
fiscal policy. That is a decision that, 
ultimately, needs to be made by the po-
litically accountable branches of gov-
ernment—the Congress and the Presi-
dent—not by the central bank, which is 
supposed to be independent and apo-
litical. 
The fact is that I think we deserve 
congratulations. Even more so, I think 
the Treasury Secretary and the Chair-
man of the Fed deserve congratulations 
for setting up the facilities that have 
made it possible for our economy to 
begin a record recovery from a very, 
very deep trough that we hit in the 
late spring of last year. 
We all know that we are not at the 
end goal in that we are not back to full 
employment yet. We have, as I said be-
fore, many companies that are in deep 
trouble and many that have gone out 
of business altogether. We have a lot of 
problems, and we need to deal with 
them, but we do know this recovery 
has been occurring at a faster pace 
than anyone projected. Most econo-
mists, including at the Fed, thought 
that we would be lucky if the unem-
ployment rate dipped below 10 percent 
by the end of this year, but it was at 6.9 
percent at the end of October. We have 
a long way to go before we get back to 
the barely above 3 percent unemploy-
ment rate that we were enjoying before 
this pandemic hit, and by all means, we 
need to stay at it until we get there, 
but we won’t do that by turning the 
Fed into the allocator of credit based 
on political demands. That would be a 
very, very bad idea. It would lead to 
worse economic outcomes and all kinds 
of distortions, and it would erode the 
independence of the Fed. 
As I say, I congratulate and com-
mend the Treasury Secretary for mak-
ing the right decision and the Chair-
man of the Federal Reserve for return-
ing the unspent money. These pro-
grams have been remarkably success-
ful. They have served their purpose. 
Their purpose is now behind us, and we 
need to continue the policies that will 
allow us to have the economic recovery 
we need without these programs con-
tinuing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, just 
as I came to the floor, I saw an an-
nouncement by the Attorney General 
of the United States that he was ap-
pointing U.S. Attorney Durham as a 
special counsel under the same provi-
sions under which Robert Mueller was 
appointed as a special counsel. While, 
ordinarily, I am no fan of special coun-
sel appointments, I think this one is 
important for a very simple reason. 
With the election of a new adminis-
tration and the peaceful transfer of 
power anticipated on January 20, it is 
important to the country that the Dur-
ham investigation—wherever it may 
lead—be concluded in a nonpolitical 
and nonpartisan fashion and that, with 
whatever is disclosed about the efforts 
made at the FBI under the direction of 
Mr. Comey—under his leadership—and 
the actions of his subordinates at the 
FBI, it is important to the country and 
to the ongoing reputation of the De-
partment of Justice and the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation that the facts 
be known and not be swept under the 
rug. 
So I congratulate the Attorney Gen-
eral for making that appointment, 
which ensures that the public, the 
American people, will finally learn 
what the facts are and not have them 
filtered through the media, which, un-
fortunately, has taken on some of the 
partisan polarization that is reflective 
of our larger society in a way that, I 
think, has prevented the facts from 
being fully known. 
Inspector General Horowitz, at the 
Department of Justice, has done a 
great service in his investigations, but 
the Durham investigation is, perhaps, 
the single most important investiga-
tion being conducted and one that, I 
hope, when it is concluded, will once 
again help to restore public confidence 
in those great American institutions 
known as the Department of Justice 
and the FBI. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Earlier this afternoon, the majority 
leader shared some good news in our 
ongoing effort to deliver an additional 
coronavirus 
relief 
package 
to 
the 
American people before we adjourn for 
the Christmas holidays. 
Following discussions with Secretary 
Mnuchin and the White House Chief of 
Staff, there now seems to be a general 
agreement on a path forward that 
could gain bipartisan support in Con-
gress and earn the signature of the 
President. 
People sometimes forget, we are an 
important part of the process, but the 
person who signs legislation or would 
choose to veto it is an important part-
ner in that legislative process as well. 
So the fact that President Trump has 
indicated he would sign such a bill is 
encouraging. 
The majority leader is in the process 
of drafting this new language, which 
could finally break the gridlock which 
has put us in such a precarious position 
in terms of delivering the relief to the 
American people that they need, both 
from a public health and an economic 
standpoint. This may finally put us on 
a path to passing another relief bill be-
fore the end of this year. 
We know we are going to have to do 
it, but we should not make the Amer-
ican people endure additional pain and 
anxiety and hardship as a result of po-
litical dysfunction by kicking it over 
into the new administration. 
For months on end, my constituents 
in Texas and the American people have 
waited as political dysfunction has 
stood in the way of progress on COVID– 
19 relief. With case counts climbing in 
Texas and across the country, the need 
for action cannot be overstated. 
It is clear that Republicans, both in 
the Congress and the White House, are 
prepared to make a deal, and I hope our 
colleagues across the aisle can bring 
themselves to stop blocking relief and 
to do the same. 
(Mr. CASSIDY assumed the Chair.) 
And as I see the Presiding Officer 
take his seat, I am reminded, too, there 
is an additional bipartisan bill, intro-
duced by a group of Senators, including 
the Presiding Officer, that I think pro-
vide some other shape and contours to

what a potential bipartisan relief pack-
age will look like. So here in the wan-
ing days of this Congress, as we ap-
proach the Christmas holidays, I think 
the best Christmas present we could 
confer on the American people is to 
work together in a bipartisan way to 
provide both the public health relief 
and the financial support that they 
need during this challenging time. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
With the work of one Congress draw-
ing to a close and the start of a new 
one just around the bend, this time of 
year is typically as busy as it is pro-
ductive. We still have a lot to do, in-
cluding funding of the government. 
With the current continuing resolution 
expiring on December 11, we need to 
get the next and final version of the 
National Defense Authorization Act to 
the President’s desk and, as I said, 
hopefully, 
agree 
on 
another 
coronavirus relief bill. 
These priorities seem to dominate 
the headlines but represent only a frac-
tion of what I hope we can accomplish 
in the waning days of this Congress. 
Before the pandemic turned the work 
of Congress on its head, we were mak-
ing serious progress on countless bills 
to help improve the lives of the Amer-
ican people, with a bipartisan focus on 
prescription drug pricing, for example. 
A poll last fall found that the No. 1 
healthcare item people want Congress 
to address is prescription drug costs. 
Since 2014, prescription drug prices 
have surged by 33 percent—more than 
any other medical product or service. 
I am honored to sit on both the Sen-
ate Finance and Judiciary Committees, 
where we have been looking at these 
high costs and some of the behavior be-
hind them. And, yes, some of this is 
caused by bad behavior. 
There are pharmacy benefit man-
agers who negotiate backdoor rebates— 
kickbacks, basically—which drive up 
out-of-pocket costs for consumers. And 
what I find seriously concerning is that 
there is anticompetitive behavior by 
some drug manufacturers to try to ma-
nipulate higher prices and to maintain 
their patent, even though, under ordi-
nary circumstances, the time for that 
patent would have expired, and it 
would have gone to generic or bio-
similar competition. 
Some companies have figured out 
how to game the system to prevent 
those lower cost competitors from ever 
reaching the market. I think the most 
popular prescription drug in America is 
HUMIRA, which is, by all accounts, 
nearly a miracle drug. It is used to 
treat arthritis and a number of other 
conditions, and it has been available on 
the market for 17 years. 
Now, you typically think of expen-
sive drugs like those that come to the 
market that are patented to preserve 
the investment that has been made 
through the research and that has pro-
duced a lifesaving drug but not one 
that has been around for nearly two 
decades. Why is it that that hasn’t 
gone from branded drug, protected by a 
patent with exclusive rights to sell it, 
to a generic or biosimilar competition? 
Well, AbbVie, the company that 
makes 
HUMIRA, 
has 
demonstrated 
how to game the system so that no 
competition can ever enter the market 
and bring those drug prices down as a 
result, and they remain the sole pro-
vider of this ubiquitous drug. 
What they have figured out, through, 
I am sure, a lot of smart lawyers and 
others, is how to weave an intricate 
maze of overlapping patents, which 
make it nearly impossible for a com-
petitor to come to market. 
To date, there are five competitors to 
HUMIRA available in Europe, but all 
are blocked from being sold here in the 
United States until 2023. How is that 
possible? Well, they have effectively 
found loopholes that allow them to cre-
ate a monopoly. And without any ac-
tion from Congress, patients will con-
tinue to pay higher prices for drugs 
like HUMIRA that should cost a frac-
tion of the current sticker price. 
Now, to be clear, patents themselves 
are not the enemy. It is important that 
we protect the intellectual property of 
people who create new lifesaving or 
life-extending drugs, like HUMIRA. 
But patents and exclusivity periods are 
designed for a purpose; that is, to allow 
these drug manufacturers to recover 
their cost and maybe, just maybe, 
make a profit. 
The problem is not the patent. The 
problem is the abuse of those patents 
by some of the pharmaceutical compa-
nies. This, of course, is driven by a de-
sire to increase their bottom line, 
which is understandable, but it is no 
excuse for manipulating or gaming the 
patent system. 
As a result, it is becoming more and 
more difficult for patients to continue 
to be able to afford the drugs they 
need. And for folks who have lost their 
jobs or healthcare during the pan-
demic, it has made many of these drugs 
simply unaffordable. 
Last year, I introduced bipartisan 
legislation with our colleague from 
Connecticut, 
Senator 
RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL, to take aim at these cor-
rupt practices. 
Our bill is called the Affordable Pre-
scriptions for Patients Act, and it 
streamlines the litigation process by 
limiting the number of patents these 
companies can claim, so companies are 
spending less time in the courtroom 
and, hopefully, encouraging the transi-
tion from branded, patented drugs to 
the lower cost generic or biosimilar 
competition. 
Our bill would allow competitors to 
resolve patent issues faster and bring 
their drugs to market sooner. And, of 
course, more competition means lower 
prices for patients. 
This legislation was specifically de-
signed not to stifle innovation. It 
doesn’t limit patent rights, and it 
doesn’t cost taxpayers a dime. In fact, 
the Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates it would actually lower Federal 
spending by more than half a billion 
dollars over 10 years—and that is just 
for the government reduction cost, not 
the cost savings to consumers or pri-
vate health plans. We know there 
would be significant savings for con-
sumers with private health insurance 
as well. 
So what happened to this bill we in-
troduced last year? Well, it passed 
unanimously in the Judiciary Com-
mittee last June. Not a single Senator 
on a famously contentious committee 
like the Judiciary Committee, where 
we have a lot of very talented Demo-
crats and Republicans—not a single 
Senator opposed it in the Judiciary 
Committee because it made so much 
sense. 
With no concerns over the policies 
laid out in the bill, I came to the Sen-
ate floor last fall to ask unanimous 
consent that it be passed. But in the 
runup to the November 3 election, the 
Democratic leader blocked the legisla-
tion. He singlehandedly stopped this 
commonsense, 
bipartisan 
legislation 
from advancing to the House. 
To make matters worse, he didn’t 
just do it once; he did it twice. The 
Democratic leader went so far as to 
call my attempt to pass this common-
sense bill ‘‘a manipulative charade’’ 
and ‘‘a little game.’’ 
This is far from a game. It is a down-
right shakedown of patients who are 
struggling to afford the drugs they 
need to improve their quality of life or 
to survive. 
I continue to hear from my constitu-
ents back home in Texas who feel bur-
dened, confused, and downright frus-
trated by rising out-of-pocket costs at 
the pharmacy. Medications they have 
been taking for years just keep getting 
more and more expensive, with no ex-
planation behind the increase. 
Another famous example is the cost 
of insulin, a drug that has been around, 
I don’t know—the Presiding Officer 
would know better than I would— 
maybe 50 years or longer. You would 
think low-cost alternatives would be 
available, but the cost of insulin just 
keeps going up and up and up as manu-
facturers learn how to game the sys-
tem to maintain the maximum price, 
and, in the meantime, it results in less 
affordability by the consumers who 
need it who may ration their insulin. 
As we heard from one witness at the 
Finance Committee, as the Presiding 
Officer will remember, a woman—I be-
lieve she was from Indiana—talked 
about her son continuing to live at 
home, putting off life-changing experi-
ences like perhaps getting married or 
buying a house because he was worried 
about his ability to continue to pay the 
deductible and the copay for the insu-
lin that was important for him to sur-
vive. 
As COVID–19 continues to create new 
stresses for the American people re-
garding their health, this is a bill 
whose time has clearly come. It is clear 
that the problem won’t go away with-
out action by Congress, and so I would 
hope that now that the election is over,

the Democratic leader would stop

ator BLUMENTHAL
and I have intro-
duced and that passed unanimously out 
of the Judiciary Committee. 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA MCSALLY 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
every other December we have the dif-
ficult task of saying farewell to some 
of our colleagues. Today, I want to say 
a few words about our friend from Ari-
zona, Senator MCSALLY, whose suc-
cessor, I believe, will be sworn into of-
fice tomorrow. 
Before she was Senator MCSALLY or 
Congresswoman 
MCSALLY, 
she 
was 
known as Colonel MCSALLY—a dedi-
cated, courageous, and extremely tal-
ented Air Force pilot. 
During her 26-year career in the Air 
Force, she made a habit out of break-
ing barriers and became the first 
woman in U.S. history to fly a fighter 
jet in combat. 
But those of us who know Senator 
MCSALLY can say—and certainly her 
incredible staff can attest to this—that 
she is not one to rest on her laurels. 
She was always pushing herself and 
those around her to aim higher, to do 
better, to work harder. So it is no sur-
prise she became the first woman ever 
to command a fighter squadron in the 
Air Force. 
Her arrival in the Senate brought 
with it a wealth of knowledge and ex-
perience on many issues that are im-
portant to our work here, particularly 
those surrounding the military and 
veterans, and Senator MCSALLY
has 
been a fierce and unyielding advocate 
for all of our servicemembers and vet-
erans and their families. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee, she has played a critical 
role in developing major legislation to 
support them, such as the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which I men-
tioned earlier. 
But she has also been a champion to 
our 
servicemembers 
through 
lesser 
known but still very important legisla-
tion. Last month, President Trump 
signed a bill she introduced to improve 
mental health delivery for veterans 
and to help those who are suffering 
from post-traumatic stress disorder to 
receive the treatment they need. 
Over the last 2 years, I have enjoyed 
working with Senator MCSALLY on a 
number of shared priorities. Both of 
our home States were devastated by 
mass shootings, and we introduced leg-
islation to reduce that sort of horrific 
violence and to prevent more commu-
nities from experiencing these trage-
dies. Of course, we are both Senators 
from border States, so you can imagine 
that we have worked together to im-
prove border security along our south-
ern border and ensure that trade and 
the good parts of having a common 
border with our southern neighbor re-
main effective and efficient. Once 
COVID–19 hit, we teamed up on legisla-
tion to protect the healthcare workers 
who lost their jobs during the pan-
demic. 
Senator MCSALLY has continuously 
fought for change, both big and small, 
to improve the lives of her constituents 
in Arizona and to strengthen our na-
tional security. We will miss this dedi-
cated friend and colleague, but I know 
her work is far from finished. I have no 
doubt that Senator MCSALLY will re-
main a strong voice for Arizonans and 
an unshakable advocate for our serv-
icemembers 
and 
veterans. 
We 
are 
grateful for her lifelong service to our 
country, and I am eager to see the 
ways that Senator MCSALLY will con-
tinue to make her home State proud 
and make the American people’s lives 
just a little bit better each day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing the provisions of rule XXII, 
the postcloture time on the Hauptman 
nomination expire at 11:45 a.m. tomor-
row and the Senate vote on confirma-
tion of the nomination; further, that if 
cloture is invoked on the Davis nomi-
nation, the Senate then vote on the 
motion to invoke cloture on the Waller 
nomination. I further ask that the 
postcloture time with respect to the 
Davis nomination expire at 2:05 p.m. 
tomorrow and the Senate vote on con-
firmation of the nomination and that 
the confirmation vote with respect to 
the Waller nomination occur at a time 
to be determined by the majority lead-
er in consultation with the Democratic 
leader on Thursday, December 3; fi-
nally, that if any of the nominations 
are confirmed, the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table and the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to, once again, 
talk about the need for this Senate and 
this Congress to pass legislation to 
deal with the COVID–19 crisis. I think 
we have to do this now before the end 
of the year—certainly, before we leave 
the Congress to go back home for the 
holiday recess. 
We just got back from a weeklong re-
cess for Thanksgiving, and all the 
Members of this body—all of them— 
had to have seen what I saw, which is 
an up-close look at the crisis that is 
upon us. 
In Ohio, our daily new cases are four 
times what they were just 1 month 
ago—four times. I see the numbers 
every single day, and they are discour-
aging. 
And it is not just new cases. It is 
more people hospitalized. It is more 
people in the ICU units. It is more peo-
ple, tragically, who are counted among 
the fatalities. 
This morning, I tried to call a friend 
of mine who is in the hospital in Co-
lumbus, OH. He is there because of 
COVID. And I am just thinking prob-
ably of the people watching tonight, 
most either have had COVID them-
selves or have a friend or a family 
member who have had COVID. 
This friend was unable to talk to me 
because he had taken a turn for the 
worse. His organs were starting to mal-
function. He had slipped into uncon-
sciousness. I was able to speak to his 
wife. I told her, of course, that he is in 
our prayers. But I also told her that he 
is in my thoughts as we look at wheth-
er we should do something more here 
at the Federal level to help with the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Of course, we should. It has been a 
long time since we took action. You 
really have to go back several months. 
The last big package was passed in 
March, about 9 months ago. It is time 
for us to act again. 
And there is some good news out 
there. With all of the negative news 
about the cases and hospitalizations, 
ICUs, and, tragically, the fatalities in-
creasing, the good news is that there is 
hope on the horizon, and that is the 
vaccines. 
I have been a big supporter of pro-
viding the Federal funding for the vac-
cines. And I applaud the administra-
tion for the work they have done on 
this Operation Warp Speed because I 
believe that while masks are critical— 
and I wear mine, and I hope you are 
wearing yours—the social distancing is 
very helpful; the work that people are 
doing on the therapies is really impor-
tant; and we need more testing, and 
that is good to know where we stand, 
but nothing can take the place of these 
vaccines. 
Think about the other diseases we 
have tackled with vaccines—measles 
and small pox and polio. My dad had 
polio as a kid. It was fairly common. 
Today, we don’t even think about it. 
These vaccinations, if they work 
well, can be amazing. And guess what 
we learned over the past several weeks. 
We learned that the early results from 
some of these vaccines, including the 
early data we have from the Moderna 
and the Pfizer candidates are incred-
ibly effective. We are talking over 90 
percent efficacy or effectiveness. 
I am participating in one of the 
trials. It is the Janssen-Johnson & 
Johnson trial. That vaccine shows 
promise also. I joined the trial, by the 
way, for a few reasons: One, because I 
really want to understand better how 
this system is working, and I had re-
ceived a briefing from a company that 
manages trials around the world, and 
they indicated to me that they were 
having trouble getting people to sign 
up. So another reason I entered was be-
cause I asked them: If I sign up, will 
that help? They said: If you are willing 
to go public, yes. So I did, and I am.

But I also joined the trial because I 
am concerned about the numbers I see 
about people’s concerns about the safe-
ty and effectiveness of these vaccines— 
because, I know, through Operation 
Warp Speed, that the science is calling 
the shots; that these scientists, the 
best in the world here in America, are 
working around the clock to get these 
vaccines out as quickly as possible, and 
we have to be sure people actually use 
them, that people are willing to get 
vaccinated. 
When I joined the trial only a few 
weeks ago—several weeks ago, maybe 4 
or 5 weeks ago. This is before the elec-
tion—Gallup had recently come out 
with a survey which said that only 50 
percent of Americans were willing to 
be vaccinated. That is not good. 
Again, this is a vaccine that is very 
effective. The flu vaccine is probably 
about 30 percent effective, and I have 
friends who say: I am not going to take 
the flu vaccine. I took one last year, 
and I got the flu anyway. Well, that is 
because it is about 30 percent effective, 
on average. 
That is not true with these vaccines. 
From the early indications, again, 90, 
95 percent, 94 percent effectiveness or 
efficacy. 
So I urge people to do their own re-
search, to look at what the scientists 
are saying, look at what Dr. Fauci is 
saying, look at what those who are the 
professionals are saying. They are say-
ing that corners are not being cut here. 
In fact, it is going quickly, but they 
are being more careful than ever to get 
this 
emergency 
use 
authorization, 
which is what the Pfizer and the 
Moderna vaccine candidates are trying 
to get right now. They actually have to 
go through more hoops than normal. 
So my hope is that this willingness to 
be vaccinated changes. 
By the way, there was another Gallup 
poll 2 weeks ago, and it didn’t show 50 
percent, it showed 58 percent are will-
ing to be vaccinated. That is good. 
That is progress. I think that is be-
cause we are beyond the election, and 
the irresponsible people who were say-
ing publicly: Gosh. I don’t know if I 
trust this because it was during the 
Trump administration, if they were 
Democrats, perhaps, have stopped say-
ing it. I hope they have because this is 
not something that is political. We 
should never politicize this. This is 
about saving lives. It is about getting 
our economy back on track. It is about 
dealing with a virus that has caused so 
much devastation and dislocation in 
our families, in our communities, in 
our businesses. 
So my hope is that everyone will be 
encouraged to, again, look at it your-
self, do your own research but get 
yourself and your families vaccinated 
because it is going to help you protect 
you and also protect the community. It 
is the only way we are going to get to 
the kind of community immunity rath-
er than community spread that all of 
us hope for. 
Leader MCCONNELL spoke on the floor 
here yesterday, the Republican leader, 
the majority leader. He said that we 
need a new COVID–19 bill to continue 
investing in the distribution system for 
these vaccines so we can get them in 
circulation as soon as possible. 
I couldn’t agree with him more. That 
is part of why we need another COVID– 
19 bill. We actually need more money 
for ensuring that we are going to have 
these vaccines broadly available with a 
distribution system that makes sense, 
that is fair but also gets this out as 
quickly as possible. 
You 
know, 
this 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed did something extraordinary. It 
is a public-private partnership. I think 
it is very innovative. They said: The 
government is going to subsidize your 
production of these vaccines, and while 
you are going through the approval 
process, which takes several months, 
you can go ahead and start producing 
what you think is the right vaccine 
that you are testing, and then, if you 
get the approval—boom—the vaccine is 
ready to go; as compared to getting the 
approval and then waiting several more 
months for the vaccine to be produced. 
That means we are going to probably 
end up discarding some vaccines that 
don’t work, that don’t get the ap-
proval. That is OK because the benefit 
is that much sooner we are going to 
have a vaccine out there now in record 
time. Unprecedented. This has never 
happened in the history of the world 
that one has been created so quickly 
and will be distributed so quickly. 
I expect we are going to have vac-
cines circulating in our communities 
within a few weeks, and I suspect that 
they will go first to, as the CDC will 
determine—and they are meeting next 
week to talk about this, as I under-
stand it—but it will probably go first 
to our healthcare providers, to the 
healthcare workers who are on the 
frontlines. It will probably go first to 
people who work in nursing homes be-
cause so much of that problem in our 
long-term care facilities comes from 
people going in and out of the facility. 
Those people should be vaccinated, the 
residents of those long-term care facili-
ties. And I believe our first responders 
need help as quickly as possible be-
cause we are putting them in impos-
sible situations. And then the most 
vulnerable among us—those who are 
immunocompromised or have other 
healthcare problems that are pre-
existing, those who are older and out in 
concentric circles from that to the 
point that, by March and April, we 
would hope that everybody would have 
the opportunity to step up and become 
vaccinated. 
That is something all of us want to 
see—Republicans and Democrats alike. 
A COVID–19 bill passed now will help 
make that happen. It will also help us 
to get over the valley. The valley, to 
me, is between now, where we have this 
surge in the virus that has not abated— 
in Ohio, I am told by the experts, in-
cluding talking to our public health of-
ficials and our Governor, we do not be-
lieve that we have peaked. I don’t 
know about your State, but I believe 
the same thing is probably true. 
So there is a valley here between now 
and the March-April timeframe. During 
those 4 months, we have to have a 
bridge, in my view. It is not forever. It 
is a bridge between now and March and 
April, when the vaccinations are broad-
ly available, and we can have the kind 
of community immunity we talked 
about earlier. 
That bridge is going to be extremely 
important to the people I represent and 
the people whom every Member on this 
floor represents. 
We had some earlier successes com-
ing together to pass legislation around 
here. When the coronavirus first hit, 
we were all together. In fact, the 
CARES Act that passed in March, 9 
months ago, passed unanimously—not 
a single negative vote. We got to-
gether, actually, for four or five dif-
ferent bills that were bipartisan, and 
we were all together. Then something 
happened. We started to sort of split 
apart. 
But when we were together, we did 
some great things. Was every penny 
spent exactly right? Probably not be-
cause it was a lot of money, but we 
saved so many small businesses. I know 
of them because they are all over Ohio, 
and I talk to them. 
The PPP program was a great suc-
cess. Again, did some get it who 
shouldn’t have? Of course, but, overall, 
it was extremely successful in keeping 
the doors open in these small busi-
nesses 
that 
otherwise 
would 
have 
closed and keeping these employees 
working and connected to work rather 
than on the unemployment lines. That 
was very important. 
CARES Act funds also were critical 
to those who lost their jobs through no 
fault of their own. You remember, we 
had a lot of shutdowns in the March 
and April timeframe. People were just 
out of work for the first time in their 
lives. I have friends who lost their jobs 
for the first times in their lives, and 
they had to go to unemployment insur-
ance. They had never done that before, 
but it saved them. They could make 
their car payments. They could make 
their rent or pay their mortgage. 
There were other important steps 
that were taken at that time to be sure 
that we didn’t have a more devastating 
impact. I am proud of the way we came 
together, but, again, that was 8 or 9 
months ago. 
And I have been frustrated that that 
sense of urgency and that willingness 
to sort of set aside the partisanship or 
whatever our specific concerns were to 
come together for the good of the coun-
try seems to have dissipated. It, par-
ticularly, seemed to disappear as we 
got closer and closer to the election. 
There seemed to be more and more pol-
itics finding its way into the discus-
sion. 
Well, the election is over. Repub-
licans here in the Senate have offered a 
responsible, targeted bill focused on 
funding our healthcare response, sup-
porting our small businesses, making

our schools safe for students to return 
to class, helping those unemployed 
through no fault of their own. We have 
actually twice had a majority of this 
Senate, in the last month and a half, 
stand up and vote for such a bill—a tar-
geted, focused bill on COVID–19 re-
sponse—52 Senators. 
(Thereupon, Mr. SCOTT of Florida 
assumed the Chair.) 
Unfortunately, here in the Senate, 
that wasn’t enough because you need 
60—a supermajority—in order to pass 
it. So although we had 52 out of 100, we 
didn’t get to 60. Democrats opposed it 
but didn’t offer an alternative here in 
the Senate and didn’t even allow us to 
get on the bill to debate it to come up 
with alternatives. Instead, they sup-
ported the House-passed bill, which is 
called the Heroes Act, which not only 
is a lot more expensive—the original 
version was probably $3.5 trillion, ac-
cording to the Congressional Budget 
Office, the most expensive legislation 
ever passed by any body of Congress— 
but also it included a number of provi-
sions that had nothing to do with the 
coronavirus. That was not something 
that a lot of us could support. There 
are immigration law changes, tax 
breaks for wealthy individuals, and 
other provisions unrelated to COVID– 
19. 
My hope is that now, the election be-
hind us, the crisis upon us, the year- 
end looming, the vaccines coming on-
line, now we can provide that bridge on 
a bipartisan basis. And I am not just 
hopeful; I am encouraged. We have 
made some recent progress towards 
what I think could be a good COVID–19 
relief package. 
This morning, a bipartisan frame-
work was put forward by what is called 
the Problem Solvers Caucus, with four 
Members on the Democratic side and 
four Members on the Republican side. 
Their proposal—we have all had a 
chance to look at it now, during the 
day, and I think it is the basis for get-
ting something done before the end of 
the year. I have been in discussion with 
those eight Members as recently as 
this afternoon. I have been in discus-
sion over the past several weeks with 
many colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle about, how do you come together 
on this? And I think what was proposed 
today by this Problem Solvers Caucus 
is a good start. It is not exactly what 
I would write. I have some ideas that I 
think are really good that aren’t in 
there, and there are some things in 
there that I wouldn’t support. It prob-
ably is not what any individual Sen-
ator would write. In fact, I am con-
fident in that. But, again, it is a good 
starting point. 
It has about $300 billion to help bol-
ster the PPP program, to keep it going 
and to help struggling small busi-
nesses. A lot of them are on the edge 
right now; I can tell you that. There is 
$16 billion for the vaccine distribution 
we talked about and also for more test-
ing and more money for therapy. There 
is $180 billion to help Americans who 
have lost their jobs during this down-
turn in the economy, in addition to a 
lot of other important provisions for 
our schools and for our healthcare pro-
viders. It doesn’t do everything Repub-
licans want; it doesn’t do everything 
Democrats want; but it does what the 
American people need. 
I hope this starting point will result 
in our getting the same kind of broad 
bipartisan support that we have had for 
previous bills that have been offered 
here on the Senate floor. 
Again, I would like to add some 
things to it that I think make a lot of 
sense. Specifically, there are some tax 
incentives to boost our economic re-
covery, like the healthy workplaces 
tax credit to help businesses reopen 
and stay open with the current safety 
and social distancing guidelines. I 
would like to expand and repurpose the 
employee retention tax credit and the 
work opportunity tax credit from the 
CARES Act into something that is 
more encompassing for companies that 
don’t qualify for PPP but that are will-
ing to retain their employees, again, 
keeping 
them 
connected 
to 
work, 
which I think is so important. 
Again, we need to act soon because I 
am concerned about some of the new 
reports coming out on the economic 
impact this pandemic is having, espe-
cially on certain sectors of the econ-
omy and particularly on middle and 
lower income Americans. After the ini-
tial economic shutdown that created 
the record unemployment numbers we 
saw in the early weeks of this pan-
demic, unemployment claims began to 
fall. The Paycheck Protection Program 
helped small businesses stay open and 
keep employees on payroll, which was 
good. As more businesses found ways to 
reopen and reopen safely, hiring picked 
up, and as of October, national unem-
ployment was moving in the right di-
rection—not 
near 
where 
it 
was 
prepandemic but still in the right di-
rection. 
But then we have seen more trou-
bling 
signs 
as 
the 
pandemic—the 
healthcare crisis aspect of the pan-
demic—has increased. One problem is 
that the partial economic recovery we 
were seeing was not evenly distributed 
across different sectors of our econ-
omy. That is pretty obvious to people. 
If you are a manufacturer in Ohio that 
closed your factory floor this spring, 
you were able to figure it out—recon-
figure the workspace, perhaps, allow 
for 
social 
distancing—and 
demand 
started to go back up, and it looks like 
our manufacturers are in pretty good 
shape now. But if you are in the hospi-
tality business, travel business, per-
sonal care business, you have been hit 
really hard. Our restaurants, bowling 
alleys, music venues, coach companies, 
and many more have had a much 
tougher path to reopening their doors 
in a safe way. 
I had a very sobering call with mem-
bers of the Ohio Restaurant Associa-
tion last week. It is troubling to me 
that more than half of all Ohio res-
taurants say it is unlikely they will be 
in business 6 months from now in the 
absence of more help. So without a new 
PPP and other help, half of them said 
they are going to close their doors. I 
am in the restaurant business. It is a 
tough business. People are hanging on. 
We have to do something to help the 
economically disadvantaged also. At 
the start of 2020, thanks to consecutive 
years of strong growth in the pre- 
COVID economy, under the Trump ad-
ministration’s Republican proposals— 
tax cuts, tax reform, regulatory relief, 
allowing our energy resources to be 
used 
in 
this 
country—things 
were 
going pretty darn well. 
The national poverty rate over the 
last few years—before COVID started 
in February of this year, the national 
poverty rate had fallen to the lowest 
rate since the government started 
tracking this statistic 60 years ago. Let 
me repeat that. The poverty rate had 
fallen to its lowest level since it was 
recorded—10.5 percent. 
The economy was good—not just low 
unemployment but also higher wages. 
We actually had in February the 19th 
straight month of wage increases of 3 
percent 
or 
more. 
That 
was 
com-
pounded. People were saying: My gosh, 
if I work hard and play by the rules, I 
can get ahead. Things were good par-
ticularly because that wage increase 
was primarily focused on lower and 
moderate-income Americans. But that 
all changed as we hit COVID. 
The early economic stimulus actu-
ally helped drive that poverty rate 
lower that I talked about in the March- 
April timeframe. But since then, a lack 
of Federal action and this sluggish eco-
nomic recovery we have seen have re-
versed that process, with nearly 7 mil-
lion Americans falling into poverty 
since May. That means the poverty 
rate has now risen 2 percentage points 
to 11.4 percent. That represents 7 more 
million Americans who have fallen into 
poverty. 
So 
people 
say: 
What 
has 
the 
coronavirus done to the economy? 
There it is. Among other things, it has 
driven the poverty rate back up after 
we had so much success. What is worse, 
the longer these individuals stay in 
poverty, the harder it will be for them 
to get out of poverty. That is one of my 
concerns—long-term unemployed, long- 
term problems with regard to the pov-
erty rate. 
A big part of the problem is that 
those who are most vulnerable to slid-
ing into poverty—these low-income 
Americans we are concerned about— 
have been the hardest hit by the waves 
of layoffs that started in the spring. 
Nearly half of all lower income adults 
now report that either they or someone 
else in their household lost a job or 
took a pay cut as a result of the eco-
nomic slowdown—half. In comparison, 
only about one-third of higher income 
Americans report being affected in this 
way. Maybe that is obvious to you, but 
the woman who works in the kitchen 
for that restaurant who lost her job,

maybe making $15, $16 an hour, com-
pared to maybe somebody who works 
in a factory making $25 or $30 an 
hour—those restaurant workers have 
been more affected. That has been 
played out through so many different 
industries around the economy where 
lower income individuals, often who 
cannot work mobile—they can’t vir-
tually work, unlike someone, say, who 
is in the financial services industry. 
They have been some of the hardest 
hit. 
Another economic slowdown caused 
by our failure to act here in Congress 
would only exacerbate those real hard-
ships being felt by those who can least 
afford it. Do we have a magic wand 
here? No. We can’t solve all the prob-
lems, but we can help. 
With so many challenges to contend 
with, it is concerning to me that the 
Senate will be in session for only 11 
more days before we adjourn for the 
holidays. We have to act, and we have 
a very short window to do so. 
By the way, we should not leave 
Washington without acting. We should 
not leave Washington for the holidays 
without passing a COVID–19 response 
bill. If we do, we will be risking even 
more devastation from the virus and 
even more economic impacts, where 
millions of Americans could lose their 
jobs, their homes, their cars, and more. 
We can help avoid this if we provide 
the necessary resources to continue to 
combat the ongoing pandemic as well 
as addressing a lot of the important 
provisions created under the CARES 
Act way back 9 months ago that were 
set to expire at the end of this year. 
Of these provisions, one of the most 
concerning to me is the cliff that we 
face with regard to unemployment ben-
efits for those who have lost their jobs 
due to COVID–19. Both the Pandemic 
Unemployment 
Assistance 
Program 
and the Pandemic Emergency Unem-
ployment Compensation Program will 
expire at the end of this month. These 
are supplementary Federal programs 
designed to help the self-employed, gig 
economy workers, and those who need 
extra support while on unemployment 
during the pandemic. I know some of 
these people. I have talked to them. 
They are nervous. They are looking at 
this year-end and thinking: My gosh, I 
am 
on 
unemployment 
now. 
Even 
though I am self-employed and I 
wouldn’t have been on it under the 
State system, now the Feds are going 
to pull out, and I am left with nothing. 
Even with the economic rebound we 
have had since the spring, we are still 
down 10 million jobs in this country 
since February. Think about it. Again, 
the economy was going great, the poli-
cies we put in place were working, and 
we are still down 10 million jobs. A fur-
ther slowdown of the economy is going 
to be tough for those long-term unem-
ployed, and my concern is that some of 
them may never reenter the workforce. 
So we need to act and act quickly to 
get them back in the mix. 
With the latest round of stricter so-
cial distancing measures and closures 
in some States in order to counter the 
coronavirus, more jobs will vanish. We 
are seeing that already. Look at the 
States that are doing shutdowns—high-
er unemployment, more people without 
a job. Losing that unemployment in-
surance lifeline will be devastating for 
lots of those Americans. Let’s not let 
that happen. 
The end of 2020 also means the end of 
other important COVID–19 response 
programs. Many individuals who had 
their incomes affected by this pan-
demic are also renters. The current na-
tional moratorium on evictions has al-
lowed these individuals to keep a roof 
over their head while they look for 
work and try to hold their lives to-
gether, but this moratorium expires at 
the end of the year. So you will see a 
lot more people losing their apartment, 
losing their home, and ending up with-
out anyplace to go. We need to act here 
in Congress to make sure that doesn’t 
happen. 
Same goes for the millions of individ-
uals who are currently relying on stu-
dent loan deferrals to free up money to 
cover expenses during the pandemic. 
Come the start of next year, these stu-
dent loan payments will be due if we 
don’t act. A lot of people relied on this. 
It is not that they won’t have to pay, 
but it has been deferred. That ends at 
year-end. 
My hope is that laying out every-
thing we stand to lose in just a few 
weeks at year-end will encourage Con-
gress to act on targeted coronavirus 
legislation to serve as that bridge—just 
as a temporary bridge between now and 
when 
we 
have 
widespread 
vaccine 
availability next spring. Failure to act 
could mean further economic suffering 
that puts millions more Americans in a 
tough spot. 
In the face of a virus that seems to be 
getting more and more out of hand 
every day, it just seems like common 
sense to me that we should act. We 
should come together to expand and ex-
tend these important programs. 
Again, I agree with Leader MCCON-
NELL, who spoke on the floor yester-
day, talking about the importance of 
providing support for, as an example, 
our hardest hit small businesses by 
having a second round of Paycheck 
Protection Program targeted at those 
companies that are actually losing 
money, 
year-to-year 
showing 
this 
month as compared to a year ago or 
this quarter as compared to a year ago 
that they are seeing a significant drop 
in the revenue. These are the ones that 
need the help the most. 
In addition, we should consider other 
important provisions, again, to provide 
funding to keep our kids safe in 
school—we want them in school; it is a 
good thing for them, but we have to be 
sure they can be safe—facilitate vac-
cine 
distribution, 
support 
our 
healthcare providers, and funding and 
flexibility for State and local govern-
ments that truly need it. They have to 
show the need. 
American lives are at stake, and we 
are in danger of losing whatever 
ground we gained on the coronavirus as 
this third wave threatens my home 
State of Ohio and the States of so 
many of my colleagues in this Cham-
ber. 
Let’s not wait any longer. Let’s come 
together and get something done that 
is good for the American people before 
the end of the year. And let’s stay here. 
I am committed to staying here. Let’s 
stay here until we do that. 
I yield the floor.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Brazil—MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes 
The Government of Brazil has requested to 
buy twenty-two (22) MK 54 conversion kits— 
to convert MK 46 Mod 5 A(S) torpedoes to 
MK 54 Mod 0 lightweight torpedoes. Also in-
cluded are torpedo containers, Recoverable 
Exercise Torpedoes (REXTORP) with con-
tainers, Fleet Exercise Section (FES) and 
fuel tanks, air launch accessories for rotary 
wing, torpedo spare parts, propellant, lan-
yard start assembly suspensions bands, ther-
mal batteries, training, publications, support 
and test equipment. U.S. Government and 
contractor engineering, technical, and logis-
tics support services, and other related ele-
ments of logistics and program support. The 
total estimated value is $70 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by improving the security 
of an important regional partner that is an 
important force for political stability and 
economic progress in South America. 
The Government of Brazil intends to uti-
lize MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes on its Si-
korsky S–70B ‘‘Seahawk’’ aircraft and sur-
face ships. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Raytheon 
Integrated Defense System, Portsmouth, RI. 
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require long-term assignment of any ad-
ditional U.S. Government or contractor rep-
resentatives to Brazil; however, U.S. Govern-
ment Engineering and Technical Services 
may be required on an interim basis for 
training and technical assistance. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–52 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional 
torpedo that can be launched from surface 
ships and rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft. 
The MK 54 is an upgrade from the MK 46 Tor-
pedo. The upgrade to the MK 54 entails re-
placement of the torpedo’s sonar and guid-
ance and control systems with modem tech-
nology. The new guidance and control sys-
tem uses a mixture of commercial-off-the- 
shelf and custom-built electronics. The war-
head, fuel tank, and propulsion system from 
the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 
configuration with minor modifications. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific

This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of a NATO 
Ally that continues to be an important force 
for political stability and economic progress 
in Europe. 
This proposed sale of the Bradley vehicle 
refurbishment/modernization will contribute 
to Croatia’s goal of updating its military ca-
pability while further enhancing interoper-
ability with the United States and other al-
lies. Croatia will have no difficulty absorb-
ing these equipment and support into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment will 
not alter the basic military balance in the 
region. 
The prime contractors will be BAE Sys-
tems, York, Pennsylvania; and Raytheon 
Missile Systems, Tucson, Arizona. There are 
no known offset agreements proposed in con-
nection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of the proposed sale will 
require U.S. Government and contractor per-
sonnel to visit Croatia on a temporary basis 
in conjunction with program oversight and 
support requirements, as well as to provide 
training and maintenance support in coun-
try. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Modernized Bradley M2 components 
which are considered to contain sensitive 
technology are as follow: 
a. Exportable version of the Second Gen-
eration Thermal ‘‘Night Vision’’ Viewer, also 
known as the Second-Generation Forward 
Looking infrared (SG–FLIR). For the Mod-
ernized Bradley M2, the SG–FLIR system in-
cludes: 
(1) Improved Bradley Acquisition Sub-
system (IBAS) is a second-generation for-
ward looking infrared (FLIR) and an electro- 
optical/TV imaging system. The IBAS has di-
rect-view optics (DVO) and the eye-safe laser 
rangefinder (ELRF). The IBAS interfaces 
with the Bradley fire control system and can 
be used for surveillance and as a back-up en-
gagement sight for the commander. 
(2) 
Commander’s 
Independent 
Thermal 
Viewer (CIV) is another version of the sec-
ond-generation 
forward 
looking 
infrared 
(FLIR) and an electro-optical/TV imaging 
system. The CIV allows the commander to 
scan for targets and maintain situational 
awareness while remaining under armor and 
without interfering with the gunner’s acqui-
sition and engagement of targets. 
(3) High Definition (HD) Long-Wave SG– 
FLIR sight is currently under development 
for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The HD 
Long-wave FLIR is being developed as an 
eventual upgrade to the capability of the 
IBAS and CIV. This case may include the 
non-recurring engineering costs associated 
with developing an exportable version of HD 
Long-wave FLIR for International use. 
b. Exportable version of the Drivers Vision 
Enhancer (DVE), the ‘‘Night Vision’’ Viewer 
utilized by the Bradley drivers is a passive 
thermal imaging system, or ‘‘night vision’’ 
device used to enhance a driver’s viewing ca-
pabilities while operating during degraded 
visual conditions, such as darkness, fog, 
smoke or dust. It provides for an improved 
situational awareness, applicable to both 
driving and surveillance. The DVE system 
consists of a Display Control Module (DCM), 
Sensor Module (SM), and Pan and Tilt Mod-
ules (PTM). The DVE is currently available 
in the standard and wide (DVE-Wide) con-
figurations. The DVE-Wide provides drivers 
with wider fields of view. 
c. Exportable version of the Inertial Navi-
gation Unit (INU) is a navigation device that 
uses motion sensors or accelerometers and 
rotation sensors or gyroscopes to continu-
ously calculate the position, the orientation, 
and the velocity of Bradley vehicle without 
the need for external references. It is a sup-
plementary, and complementary to the glob-
al positioning system (GPS). In the event of 
a lack of a GPS signal, the INU maintains 
position, velocity, and situational aware-
ness. 
d. The Radio Frequency TOW 2A (RF) Mis-
sile (BGM–71E–4B–RF) is a direct attack mis-
sile designed to defeat armored vehicles, re-
inforced urban structures, field fortification

and other such targets. TOW Missiles are 
fired from a variety of TOW Launchers in the 
U.S. Army, USMC and FMS customer forces. 
The TOW 2A RF missile can be launched 
from the same launcher platforms as the ex-
isting wire-guided TOW 2A missile without 
modification to the launcher. The TOW 2A 
missile (both wire and RF) contains two 
tracker beacons (Xenon and thermal) for the 
launcher to track and guide the missile in 
flight. Guidance commands from the launch-
er are provided to the missile by the RF link 
contained within the missile case. The hard-
ware, software, and technical publications 
provided with the sale thereof are unclassi-
fied. However, the system itself contains sen-
sitive technology that instructs the system 
on how to operate in the presence of counter-
measures. 
e. The Radio Frequency TOW 2B (RF) Mis-
sile (BGM–71F–3–RF) is a fly-over shootdown 
missile designed to defeat armored vehicles. 
TOW Missiles are fired from a variety of 
TOW Launchers in the U.S. Army, USMC and 
FMS customer forces. The TOW 2B RF mis-
sile can be launched from the same launcher 
platforms as the existing wire-guided TOW 
2B missile without modification to the 
launcher. The TOW 2B missile (both wire and 
RF) contains two tracker beacons (Xenon 
and thermal) for the launcher to track and 
guide the missile in flight. Guidance com-
mands from the launcher are provided to the 
missile by the RF link contained within the 
missile case. The hardware, software, and 
technical publications provided with the sale 
thereof are unclassified. However, the sys-
tem itself contains sensitive technology that 
instructs the system on how to operate in 
the presence of countermeasures. 
f. The Radio Frequency TOW Bunker Bust-
er (BB) Missile (BGM–71H–1–RF) is a variant 
of the TOW 2A that replaces the TOW 2A 
warhead with a high explosive blast-frag-
mentation warhead. The bulk charge war-
head is effective against reinforced concrete 
walls, light armored vehicles, and earth and 
timber bunkers. Guidance commands from 
the launcher are provided to the missile by 
the RF link contained within the missile 
case. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures or equivalent systems which might 
reduce weapon system effectiveness or be 
used in the development of a system with 
similar or advanced capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Croatia can provide the same degree of pro-
tection for the sensitive technology being re-
leased as the U.S. Government. This sale is 
necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign 
policy and national security objectives out-
lined in the enclosed Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Croatia.

of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a Major Non-NATO Ally that is a 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in the Pacific region. 
The proposed sale will improve the Repub-
lic of Korea’s capability to meet current and 
future threats. Korea will use the systems

Weapon System (CIWS) consists of a rapid- 
fire computer-controlled radar and gun sys-
tem mounted on a turret designed to defeat 
anti-ship missiles; small surface craft; low, 
slow aircraft; rockets and mortars. The 
weapons system carries out search, detec-
tion, target threat evaluation, tracking, fir-
ing and kill loop fire control that uses ad-
vanced radar and computer technology to lo-
cate, identify and direct a system of armor 
piercing projectiles to the target. The Pha-
lanx Block 1B Baseline 2 (1B2) Radar Up-
grade Kits converted the system’s radar from 
an analog to digital suite, and in doing so ad-
dressed significant hardware obsolescence. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is CONFIDEN-
TIAL. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary

quested U.S. Security Assistance Office 
(SAO) support services to include technical 
assistance and advisory support to the King-
dom of Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Defense 
(MOD) for an additional five years, through 
the U.S. Military Training Mission to Saudi 
Arabia (USMTM) located in Riyadh, Saudi 
Arabia SAO support services provided in-

and 
other 
related

This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a friendly country that is a force for 
political stability and economic progress in 
the Middle East. 
This proposed sale will continue to im-
prove Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet cur-
rent 
and 
future 
threats 
by 
utilizing 
USMTM’s continued efforts to train, advise, 
and assist the Saudi Arabian Armed Forces 
to build defense capacity and capability 
through military exercises and professional 
military education. USMTM conducts non- 
combat, institutional advising that assists 
the MOD in developing, training, and sus-

ices will not alter the basic military balance 
in the region. 
There is no prime contractor associated 
with this proposed sale. There are no known 
offset agreements in connection with this po-
tential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
continue to require the permanent assign-
ment of approximately 330 U.S. Military, 
U.S. Government, and Foreign National 
USMTM staff members to Saudi Arabia. Ad-
ditional Training Advisory Field Teams 
(TAFT) and Support teams will travel to the 
country on a temporary basis as required. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(150) each). Also included are spare and re-
pair parts, publications and technical docu-
mentation, personnel training and training 
equipment, technical and logistics support 
services, and other related elements of 
logistical and program support. The total es-
timated cost is $55.5 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a partner country that continues to be an 
important force for political stability and 
economic progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale will provide sufficient 
modern transport vehicles to improve Leb-
anon’s capability to meet current and future 
threats by improving its ability to move 
troops and supplies around the country to 
counter violent extremist organizations and 
to secure its border. Lebanon will have no 
difficulty absorbing this additional equip-
ment and services into its armed forces as 
they currently operate over one thousand 
(1,000) HMMWVs of various variants. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be American 
General, South Bend, Indiana. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of two (2) U.S. con-
tractor representatives to Lebanon for a du-
ration of up to thirteen (13) weeks to conduct 
HMMWV operator and maintenance training. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I was 
necessarily absent, but had I been 
present I would have voted yes on roll-
call vote No. 240, motion to invoke clo-
ture on the nomination of Taylor B. 
McNeel, of Mississippi, to be United 
States District Judge for the Southern 
District of Mississippi.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR MARK BEDRIN 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today I 
want to take a few minutes to recog-
nize MAJ Mark Bedrin for his exem-
plary dedication to duty and service as 
an Army congressional fellow and con-
gressional budget liaison for the As-
sistant Secretary of the Army, Finan-
cial 
Management 
and 
Comptroller. 
Major Bedrin is transitioning from his 
present assignment to continue his 
service to our country as an Army offi-
cer. 
The cornerstone of Mark’s success as 
an officer is his family. He is a dedi-
cated husband to his wife Katie and a 
devoted father to his children: daugh-
ter Elizabeth and son Patrick. They 
provide the foundation for Mark’s serv-
ice, and they are his off-time partners 
in travel, canoeing, fishing, and explor-
ing the great outdoors. 
A native of Kirkwood, NY, Major 
Bedrin graduated from Pennsylvania 
State University in 2009, with a bach-
elor of arts in history, and commis-
sioned into the Infantry branch, where 
he served as a platoon leader and com-
pany commander. Other notable pre-
vious 
assignments 
include 
platoon 
leader, Attack Company, 1–32 IN, 3rd 
BCT, 10th Mountain Division at Fort 
Drum, NY, and Afghanistan; assistant 
operations officer, rifle troop com-
mander, and headquarters and head-
quarters troop commander, 1st Squad-
ron, 2d Cavalry Regiment, U.S. Army 
Europe, in Germany, Afghanistan, and 
Egypt. His operational deployments in-
clude two combat tours in support of 
Operation Enduring Freedom in Af-
ghanistan and one peacekeeping tour 
supporting the Multinational Force 
and Observers, MFO, in Egypt. 
Following 
a 
successful 
command 
tour, Mark applied to and was selected 
for the highly competitive U.S. Army 
Congressional 
Fellowship 
Program. 
This program enables outstanding mili-
tary officers and DOD civilians to bring 
their talents to the hill and to work in 
a Member’s office as a congressional 
defense fellow to learn firsthand how 
Congress operates. It also provides an 
opportunity for the fellow to earn a 
master’s degree in legislative affairs at 
George Washington University, GWU. 
Mark joined my office as an Army 
congressional fellow in January 2017, 
and we had the great benefit of his 
service on Team Moran for a year be-
fore he departed for the Pentagon in 
January 2018 for a utilization tour as a 
congressional budget liaison with the 
Assistant Secretary of the Army, Fi-
nancial Management and Comptroller. 
Mark has worked tirelessly with 
Members of Congress and congressional 
staff to accurately articulate and to 
timely provide the Army’s budget posi-
tions to the Appropriations Commit-
tees and to answer questions related to 
Army programs and priorities for Mem-
bers of Congress and congressional 
staff. His dedication, professionalism, 
and commitment to the Army are un-
matched, and his work both as a fellow 
and as a liaison successfully rep-
resented the U.S. Army and the De-
partment of Defense to the U.S. Con-
gress. 
Throughout his career, Major Bedrin 
has positively impacted soldiers, peers, 
and superiors. Our country has bene-
fited tremendously from his extraor-
dinary leadership, judgment, and pas-
sion. I join my colleagues today in hon-
oring his dedication to our nation and 
invaluable service to the U.S. Congress. 
It has been a genuine pleasure to 
have worked with Major Mark Bedrin 
over the last 3 years. On behalf of a 
grateful nation, I join my colleagues 
today in recognizing and commending 
Mark for his service to our country, 
and we wish Mark and his family all 
the very best in their future endeavors. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE HELDSTAB 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Mike 
Heldstab joined my staff in June of 
2014. Serving as my State military liai-
son, he assisted well over a thousand 
Kansas veterans and Active service-
members during his 61⁄2 years on my 
staff. Mike would often travel the 
State in my stead, between commu-
nities in south central Kansas and our 
military installations—namely, Fort 
Riley and his hometown of Junction 
City. 
Mike is a tireless advocate for serv-
icemembers and veterans. He is well 
known in the Kansas military and vet-
erans communities as a trusted re-
source who produces results. Most no-
tably, Mike advocated for a policy 
change in the VA’s Specially Adapted 
Housing Program after working with 
the family of a disabled Army veteran 
to adapt their home. His efforts re-
sulted in new legislation that was 
signed into law on August 8, 2020, that 
expanded this critical grant program so 
disabled 
veterans 
can 
adapt 
their 
homes to fit their disability. I am con-
fident that Mike’s selfless approach to 
service will continue in every aspect of 
his life. 
In addition to his work assisting vet-
erans and military servicemembers, 
Mike was involved in Wichita-area vol-
unteer organizations and strived to be 
a community leader. Mike has a pas-
sion for economic development that I 
am certain will serve him well in his 
next chapters in life. I commend his ef-
forts to make Kansas and Wichita a 
better place. 
Mike’s highlights from his years on 
staff include being able to travel and 
meet with Senator Bob Dole between 
2014 and 2015 when Kansas’s Favorite 
Son was touring all 105 counties. He 
also cherished his opportunities to 
interact with our military, which pro-
vided him the chance to fly in Air 
Force tankers out of McConnell Air 
Force Base and playing wheelchair bas-
ketball with wounded warriors. 
While Mike is leaving our staff, I 
know I will see him many more times 
in the years ahead as a friend and 
trusted adviser. Thank you, Mike, for 
your many years of service to the citi-
zens of Kansas, and I wish you all the 
best as you start this new chapter of 
your career.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR BRIAN 
LEITZKE 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I rise 
today to acknowledge and honor MAJ 
Brian Leitzke for his dedicated service 
in the U.S. Air Force and his comple-
tion of the Air Force Legislative De-
fense Fellowship with my office. Major 
Leitzke joined my office in January of 
this year, where he served as my De-
fense Fellow. Previously, he served as 
an Air Force Fellow in the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense. As a Defense Fel-
low, Major Leitzke demonstrated a su-
perior work ethic and tireless dedica-
tion to his legislative duties, making 
him a trusted voice and integral mem-
ber of my defense team. Major Leitzke 
drafted or coauthored almost 40 pieces 
of legislation, including $45.2 billion in 
authorizations for the National De-
fense 
Authorization 
Act 
and 
the 
CARES Act. Additionally, he prepared 
for 28 hearings of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and orchestrated

more than 30 engagements between De-
partment of Defense principals, staff, 
and Members of Congress. Finally, he 
single-handedly championed the bill 
which granted Sergeant First Class 
Alwyn C. Cashe the President of the 
United States Medal of Honor Author-
ity. As part of this effort, he galvanized 
bicameral, bipartisan support across 12 
Member offices. 
Brian is a humble professional, re-
lentlessly focused on accomplishing 
tremendous work for our nation, as 
demonstrated both in my office and 
during his time in the Air Force. Prior 
to his current status as a Defense Fel-
low, Major Leitzke was an F–15E in-
structor at the USAF Weapons School, 
embracing the task of teaching the Air 
Force’s 
best 
tacticians. 
There, 
he 
served as the wing weapons officer and 
was selected Wing Instructor of the 
Year. He had a career of continuous 
flying until this assignment, with com-
bat experience in Operation ENDUR-
ING FREEDOM, and well over 500 in-
structor hours. He recently completed 
an Air University master’s with ‘‘High-
est 
Academic 
Distinction’’ 
and 
achieved a 4.0 grade point average. 
Major Leitzke demonstrated tactical 
acumen and extraordinary leadership 
ability in each of these challenges, in-
cluding his time in the Senate. 
On behalf of the U.S. Senate and a 
grateful nation, I want to express our 
thanks to Major Letizke for his dedi-
cated service to the U.S. Air Force, the 
U.S. Senate, Arkansans, and all Ameri-
cans. My office has benefited greatly 
from his tireless efforts and leadership. 
I have no doubt the U.S. Air Force will 
continue to reap the benefits from this 
truly dedicated American. As I thank 
Major Leitzke for his service, I also 
thank his wonderful family, which has 
remained by his side for his years of 
military service. Major Leitzke resides 
in Woodbridge, VA, with his loving 
wife, Amanda Leitzke, and three chil-
dren, Lincoln, Faith, and Kamali. It 
has been a great privilege to work with 
Major Leitzke, and I wish him the best 
of luck on his next assignment. Thank 
you for everything Major Brian ‘‘Bud’’ 
Leitzke. Continue your work doing 
‘‘Good things for America.’’ ‘‘Banzai!’’

Whereas lung cancer is the second most 
common cancer in the United States; 
Whereas it is estimated that 1 in 15 men 
and 1 in 17 women in the United States will 
develop lung cancer during their lifetime; 
Whereas it is estimated that in 2020, 228,820 
individuals in the United States will be diag-
nosed with lung cancer, and 135,720 individ-
uals will die from the disease; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for local-
ized lung cancer is around 59 percent, yet 
only about 17 percent of lung cancers are di-
agnosed at this stage; 
Whereas screening individuals at high risk 
of lung cancer using low-dose computed to-
mography can detect lung cancer earlier 
than other forms of screening and ultimately 
save lives; 
Whereas lung cancer screening can effec-
tively reduce lung cancer mortality, yet only 
3.9 to 8.6 percent of individuals in the United 
States at high risk of lung cancer undergo 
lung cancer screening with low-dose com-
puted tomography; and 
Whereas educational efforts can increase 
awareness of lung cancer and lung cancer 
screening among the general public, patients 
and their families, and health care workers, 
thereby increasing the early detection of 
lung cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 2020 as ‘‘National 
Lung Cancer Awareness Month’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Lung Cancer Awareness Month; 
(3) promotes efforts to increase awareness 
of, and education about, lung cancer and 
lung cancer screening among individuals in 
the United States; 
(4) recognizes the need for research on the 
early diagnosis, screening, and treatment of 
lung cancer; and 
(5) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe National Lung Cancer 
Awareness Month with appropriate aware-
ness and educational activities.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
781—SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS OF WORLD 
AIDS DAY 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. 
SULLIVAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 781 
Whereas, as of the end of 2019, an estimated 
38,000,000 people were living with human im-
munodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired im-
munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), including 
1,800,000 children; 
Whereas, in the United States, more than 
770,000 people with HIV/AIDS have died since 
the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, in-
cluding nearly 16,000 deaths among people 
with diagnosed HIV in 2018, with the disease 
disproportionately affecting certain popu-
lations; 
Whereas each year nearly 40,000 people be-
come newly diagnosed with HIV in the 
United States; 
Whereas communities of color are dis-
proportionately affected by the spread of 
HIV in the United States; 
Whereas, in order to address the HIV epi-
demic in the United States, on August 18, 
1990, Congress enacted the Ryan White Com-
prehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act 
of 1990 (Public Law 101–381; commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Ryan White CARE Act’’) to 
provide primary medical care and essential 
support services for people living with HIV 
who would benefit from these services; 
Whereas the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Pro-
gram provides services and support for over 
half of all people diagnosed with HIV in the 
United States; 
Whereas, to further focus attention on the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic among minority commu-
nities in the United States, in 1998, the Mi-
nority AIDS Initiative was established to 
provide funds to State and local institutions 
and organizations to best serve the health 
care costs and support the needs of racial 
and ethnic minorities living with HIV; 
Whereas the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals established a global tar-
get to end AIDS as a public health threat by 
2030; 
Whereas, in order to further address the 
global HIV/AIDS epidemic, in 2003, Congress 
and the White House created the President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); 
Whereas the PEPFAR program remains 
the largest commitment in history by any 
country to combat a single disease; 
Whereas, as of 2019, PEPFAR has supported 
treatment for approximately 15,700,000 peo-
ple, including by providing antiretroviral 
drugs to 2,600,000 pregnant women living 
with HIV to prevent the transmission of HIV 
from mother to child during birth; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2019, PEPFAR di-
rectly supported HIV testing and counseling 
for nearly 79,600,000 people; 
Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria, launched in 2002, 
has helped provide antiretroviral therapy to 
approximately 20,100,000 people living with 
HIV/AIDS and to 718,000 pregnant women to 
prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS to 
their children, saving an estimated 38,000,000 
lives, as of 2019; 
Whereas the United States is the largest 
donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tu-
berculosis and Malaria, and every $1 contrib-
uted by the United States leverages an addi-
tional $2 from other donors, as required by 
law; 
Whereas considerable progress has been 
made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, includ-
ing a 23-percent reduction in new HIV infec-
tions, over a 40-percent reduction in new HIV 
infections among children, and over a 30-per-
cent reduction in the number of AIDS-re-
lated deaths between 2010 and 2019; 
Whereas approximately 25,400,000 people 
had access to antiretroviral therapy in 2019, 
compared to only 7,800,000 people who had ac-
cess to such therapy in 2010; 
Whereas research funded by the National 
Institutes of Health found that HIV treat-
ment not only saves the lives of people living 
with HIV, but people living with HIV on ef-
fective antiretroviral therapy and who are 
durably virally suppressed cannot sexually 
transmit HIV, proving that HIV treatment is 
prevention; 
Whereas it is estimated that, without 
treatment, half of all infants living with HIV 
will die before their second birthday; 
Whereas, despite the remarkable progress 
in combating HIV, significant challenges re-
main; 
Whereas there were approximately 1,700,000 
new HIV infections in 2019 globally, struc-
tural barriers continue to make testing and 
treatment programs inaccessible to highly 
vulnerable populations, and an estimated 
7,100,000 people living with HIV globally still 
do not know their HIV status; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reports that more than 37,000 
people were diagnosed with HIV in the 
United States in 2018 and 14 percent of the 
1,200,000 in the United States living with HIV 
are not aware of their HIV status; 
Whereas men who have sex with men 
(MSM), particularly young MSM of color, are 
the population most affected by HIV in the 
United States; 
Whereas southern areas of the United 
States bear the greatest burden of HIV, ac-
counting for 51 percent of new infections in 
2018; 
Whereas people living with HIV are fre-
quently susceptible to comorbidities, such as 
hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis; 
Whereas the opioid and heroin epidemics 
have led to increased numbers of new HIV in-
fections among people who inject drugs; 
Whereas the crisis has disproportionately 
affected nonurban areas, where HIV preva-
lence rates have been low historically and 
have limited services for HIV prevention and

ment; 
Whereas, in 2020, the United States hosted 
the Conference of the International AIDS So-
ciety, reinforcing the important leadership 
role the United States plays in ending AIDS 
globally; 
Whereas 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
placed a significant burden on the public 
health systems across the United States and 
the globe; 
Whereas December 1 of each year is inter-
nationally

fections, zero discrimination, and zero AIDS- 
related deaths, in order to end the HIV epi-
demic in the United States and around the 
world by 2030; 
(2) commends the efforts and achievements 
in combating HIV/AIDS through the Ryan 
White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 
2009 (Public Law 111–87), the Minority HIV/ 
AIDS Initiative, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, the National Institutes 
of Health, the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration, the Office 
of Minority Health, and the Office of the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services; 
(3) commends the efforts and achievements 
in combating HIV/AIDS made by PEPFAR, 
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV/AIDS; 
(4) supports continued funding for preven-
tion, care, and treatment services, and re-
search programs for communities impacted 
by HIV and people living with HIV in the 
United States and globally; 
(5) urges, in order to ensure that an AIDS- 
free generation is achievable, rapid action by 
all countries toward further expansion and 
scale-up of antiretroviral treatment pro-
grams, including efforts to reduce disparities 
and improve access for children to life-sav-
ing medications; 
(6) encourages the scaling up of com-
prehensive prevention services, including 
biomedical and structural interventions, to 
ensure inclusive access to programs and ap-
propriate protections for all people at risk of 
contracting HIV, especially in communities 
disproportionately impacted; 
(7) calls for greater focus on the HIV-re-
lated vulnerabilities of women and girls, in-
cluding women and girls at risk for or who 
have survived violence or faced discrimina-
tion as a result of the disease; 
(8) supports continued leadership by the 
United States in domestic, bilateral, multi-
lateral, and private sector efforts to fight 
HIV; 
(9) encourages input from civil society in 
the development and implementation of do-
mestic and global HIV policies and programs 
that guide the response; 
(10) encourages and supports greater de-
grees of ownership and shared responsibility 
by developing countries in order to ensure 
the sustainability of the domestic responses 
to HIV/AIDS by those countries; and 
(11) urges other members of the inter-
national community to sustain and scale up 
their support for and financial contributions 
to efforts around the world to combat HIV.
