ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. President, for the information of 
Senators, we expect to have this vote 
later today. Obviously, the delay in 
getting here because of the snow has 
forced us to postpone it until later in 
the day. 
REMEMBERING HARRY REID 
Mr. President, first, let me wish you 
and all of my colleagues a happy and 
healthy new year. I hope everyone 
traveling across the country remains 
safe in the face of these recent winter 
storms. 
This morning, let me begin with a 
few words on the loss of our dear 
friend, our beloved former leader, and 
one of the brightest stars to ever serve 
in the U.S. Senate, our former col-
league Harry Reid of Searchlight, NV, 
as he would proudly refer to himself. 
Harry Reid, in short, was one of the 
most incredible individuals I have ever 
met, the sort of person you come 
across only a handful of times in your 
life. He was tough as nails, a fighter to

his core, but also one of the most com-
passionate individuals you could imag-
ine. 
To lose Harry Reid is like losing 
track of the North Star. There are 
many in this Chamber who got to 
where they are because of him. 
Next Wednesday, January 12, Harry 
will make his final return to the U.S. 
Capitol, where he will lie in state under 
the Rotunda. As we honor his life and 
legacy, I will have more to say in the 
coming days. But for now, I can only 
say that Harry was my leader, my 
mentor, and one of my dearest friends. 
When you lose someone who is as 
close to us as Harry was, they are 
never truly gone. They will always 
stay with us. As we gavel in today, I 
take comfort knowing that Harry is 
with us in spirit, walking alongside us 
as we continue the work he dedicated 
himself to for so many years. 
To 
Harry’s 
family, 
to 
his 
wife 
Landra, to all the children and grand-
children, I offer my prayers and my 
condolences. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Now, Mr. President, the Senate gav-
els in on this icy January morning to 
mark the beginning of a new year, and 
there is much we must accomplish. At 
the start of 2020, few could have fore-
seen the awful trials our country has 
endured over the past 2 years. 
But, against adversity, the American 
people responded. Last year, over 200 
million 
Americans 
got 
vaccinated 
against COVID, 6 million jobs were 
added back to the economy, and Con-
gress delivered on historic legislation 
that gave Americans a much needed 
lifeline to get through the worst of 
COVID. 
In a 50–50 Senate, we passed the first 
stand-alone infrastructure bill in dec-
ades, passed historic funding for the 
sciences and tech innovation, and con-
firmed the most judicial nominees in a 
President’s first year since Ronald 
Reagan. 
Despite the immense challenges be-
fore us, we now begin 2022 better off 
compared to where we were 1 year ago. 
But, of course, there is much, much 
still left to do. So let us continue. 
To begin this week, the Senate will 
vote to confirm Gabriel Sanchez as 
U.S. circuit court judge for the Ninth 
Circuit. A graduate of Yale, a Ful-
bright scholar, and a current associate 
justice of the California Court of Ap-
peals, Justice Sanchez has presided in 
hundreds of cases and has the experi-
ence and expertise necessary to be an 
excellent 
addition 
to 
the 
Federal 
bench. 
Off the floor, the negotiations will 
continue with Members of our caucus 
and with the White House on finding a 
path forward on Build Back Better. As 
I mentioned before Christmas, I intend 
to hold a vote in the Senate on BBB, 
and we will keep voting until we get a 
bill passed. The stakes are high for us 
to find common ground on this legisla-
tion. The climate crisis continues to 
worsen. Families and children continue 
dealing with the impacts of COVID, 
and too many Americans still struggle 
to pay the high cost of healthcare and 
prescription drugs. We will keep work-
ing until we get something done. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. President, now, about January 6 
and defending democracy, at the same 
time the Senate will also proceed on 
another urgent and fundamental mat-
ter: protecting our democracy and 
strengthening the right to vote in free 
and fair elections. 
Later today, I will meet with a num-
ber of my colleagues to continue our 
conversation on voting rights, and I 
will meet with our entire caucus for 
the first time this year to talk about 
how we are going to move forward. 
There has been constant discussion 
among Members over the break—con-
stant. I must have made a minimum of 
10 phone calls every day, with maybe 
the exception of Christmas, in respect 
for my colleagues. But we have to keep 
moving forward. 
And, a few days from now, our coun-
try will observe a dark and troubling 
milestone: the 1-year anniversary of 
January 6, the day that thousands of 
rioters, urged on by the vicious lies of 
the disgraced former President, waged 
a violent assault upon the U.S. Capitol 
in order to prevent a peaceful transfer 
of power. 
This was no just peaceful demonstra-
tion; this was aimed at undoing our de-
mocracy. Thank God they failed. 
As I said hours after the attack, Jan-
uary 6, 2021, will be forever remem-
bered as a day of enduring infamy, a 
permanent blemish in the story of 
American democracy, and the final, 
bitter act of the worst President—the 
worst President—in modern times. 
Of course, over the course of this 
week, we will pay tribute to the heroes 
who stepped up that fateful day: our 
Capitol Police, the DC Metro Police, 
our National Guard who kept watch for 
months, and everyone who acted quick-
ly that day to save the lives and save 
our democracy. But this week—this 
week—we must also acknowledge that 
the attack on January 6 was not a one- 
off. It did not materialize out of the 
blue. On the contrary, January 6 was a 
symptom of a much broader illness 
that has now infected the modern Re-
publican 
Party: 
an 
effort 
to 
delegitimize our elections, rooted in 
Donald Trump’s Big Lie. 
While January 6 was only 1 day, the 
Big Lie lives on and has only grown 
stronger. The Big Lie lives on in Re-
publican-dominated State legislatures, 
where at least 19 States have passed 33 
new laws that will potentially make it 
harder—harder—for millions to vote in 
our elections. They say they want to 
prevent fraud, and they have no evi-
dence of fraud. We all know what they 
are up to: vitiating, poisoning our elec-
tions, this sacred part of American de-
mocracy. 
And the violence and threats of vio-
lence continue. The Big Lie lives on 
through the troubling wave of violent 
threats that election workers across 
the country have endured over the 
course of the last year, all simply for 
the audacity of having done their job 
to count the votes fairly and without 
bias. 
If left alone—if left alone—the Big 
Lie threatens the very future of our 
Republic. If people don’t believe in the 
sanctity of our elections, what is going 
to happen to this Republic? The sanc-
tity of elections, the fairness of elec-
tions, the fact that after election day 
we abide by the results has been the 
cornerstone of our entire democracy. It 
is what democracy is all about. It is 
what 
the 
Founding 
Fathers 
con-
structed. Are we going to let that go by 
the wayside? Are we going to let it be 
poisoned and vitiated, with huge con-
sequences to the effect of this Nation, 
probably greater than any we have 
seen since the Civil War? 
So, as we remember January 6 this 
week and as we confront State-level 
voter suppression, we must be clear 
that they are not isolated develop-
ments; they are all directly linked to 
the same anti-democratic poison of the 
Big Lie. 
Let me say that one more time. The 
insurrection of January 6, the flurry of 
new voter restriction laws, and the 
State-level efforts to subvert democ-
racy are not isolated developments but 
manifestations of the same anti-demo-
cratic poison of Donald Trump’s Big 
Lie, and they all demand the same so-
lution: The Senate must advance legis-
lation to protect our democracy and 
safeguard the right to vote. 
Over the coming weeks, the Senate 
will thus consider legislation we can 
pass to achieve this goal. Democrats 
for months have tried to bring Repub-
licans to the table, but every single 
time, Republicans use the rules of the 
Senate to prevent even a debate. 
Voting rights in the past was a bipar-
tisan issue. How quickly they forget. 
Republican 
Presidents—Ronald 
Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. 
Bush—supported voting rights. 
When voting rights extensions came 
up in this body in the past, they passed 
by large majorities—bipartisan. The re-
sistance we see from modern-day Re-
publicans is a beast of an entirely dif-
ferent nature. Maybe some of them 
were scared of Trump. But too many of 
them see this as a way to win advan-
tage, to get their hard-right views en-
acted, even though the public doesn’t 
support them, by jaundicing our elec-
tion process and putting barriers in the 
way of particular people—not all peo-
ple—of voting: people of color, poor 
people, people who live in big cities, 
young people, handicapped people, el-
derly people. 
As I said in my ‘‘Dear Colleague’’ 
earlier this week, if Republicans con-
tinue to hijack the rules of the Cham-
ber to prevent action on something as 
critical as protecting our democracy, 
then the Senate will debate and con-
sider changes to the rules on or before 
January 17, Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7 
January 4, 2022 
Over the course of history, the Sen-
ate has debated voting rights many 
times and done what was necessary to 
take action, but rarely did our prede-
cessors face the sort of malice that now 
confronts our democracy from within. 
One final point. I mean, the argu-
ments from the other side—they are 
saying: Federalize the elections. That 
is in the Constitution, that Federal 
elections can be determined by Federal 
legislation. That is what some of our 
great post-Civil War amendments were 
all about. That is what the history of 
voting 
rights 
legislation 
has 
been 
about. When State legislatures, for rea-
sons often bigoted and racist, said peo-
ple couldn’t vote for one reason or an-
other or stopped them from voting, the 
Congress stepped in. That is nothing 
new. It is unbelievable the arguments 
they come up with—just totally false. 
Totally false. 
So as we hold this debate, I ask my 
colleagues to consider this question: If 
the right to vote is the cornerstone of 
our democracy, then how can we Demo-
crats permit a situation in which Re-
publicans can pass voter suppression 
laws at the State level with only a sim-
ple majority vote but not allow the 
U.S. Senate to do the same? And I ask 
that of my Democratic colleagues—my 
Democratic colleagues. 
This asymmetry cannot hold. If Sen-
ate Republicans continue to abuse the 
filibuster to prevent this body from 
acting, then the Senate must adapt. 
The Senate always has. 
Robert C. Byrd, one of this Cham-
ber’s great traditionalists, acknowl-
edged that Senate rules that seemed 
appropriate in the past ‘‘must be 
changed 
to 
reflect 
changed 
cir-
cumstances.’’ Boy oh boy, do we have 
changed circumstances now with this 
abandonment of voting rights by the 
Republican Party and a willingness to 
let voters from one end of the country 
to the other be suppressed. As times 
change and circumstances evolve, the 
Senate must follow the suit of changed 
circumstances when necessary. So we 
are going to work towards that goal in 
the coming weeks. 
To downplay the threat against our 
democracy 
is 
dangerous—dangerous. 
We have seen this in history forever. 
When people try to subvert democracy, 
when they use threats of violence to do 
so, if good people don’t stand up, the 
democracy can wither. We cannot let 
that happen to our wonderful country. 
There is no better way to heal the 
damage of January 6 than to act so 
that our constitutional order is pre-
served for the future. If we do not act 
to protect our elections, the horrors of 
January 6 will risk becoming not the 
exception but the norm. The stakes 
could not be higher. So we are going to 
move forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
REMEMBERING HARRY REID 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Mark 
Twain said that ‘‘the two most impor-
tant days in your life are the day you 
were born and the day you find out 
why.’’ 
Harry Reid grew up in the tiny min-
ing town of Searchlight, NV. This poli-
tician class, which I am part of, likes 
to try to trace their roots to some 
humble beginning, some log cabin ex-
perience that they have overcome to 
reach public office. Harry didn’t have 
to fake it. He was the third of four boys 
born in the Great Depression to a very 
poor family. His father was a hard-rock 
miner who battled alcoholism and was 
tortured by depression. His father took 
his own life. Harry came to the floor so 
many times, I can remember, and 
spoke of this issue of suicide and what 
it had meant to him as a boy growing 
up and what it meant to so many peo-
ple across America. 
His mother, a sweet, humble woman, 
helped to feed the family by doing 
laundry. The family home was a sight 
to behold—a tin-roofed, wooden cabin 
with no indoor plumbing, no hot water, 
and no telephone. 
The day Harry came into this world 
was December 2, 1939. The day he had 
his Mark Twain moment and learned 
why he was put here happened 30 years 
later. 
Against all odds, Harry had escaped 
the poverty of his childhood. He had 
put himself through law school at 
George Washington University here in 
Washington, DC, and he worked as a 
Capitol Police officer in this building 
to pay for his law school. After grad-
uating, he returned to Nevada as a 
young lawyer and got involved in local 
politics. 
Then came that Mark Twain mo-
ment. Harry attended a speech at the 
University of Nevada in Reno by a 
writer named Alex Haley. Haley’s 
masterwork, ‘‘Roots,’’ traced the story 
of one American family’s triumphant 
rise over several generations from the 
horrors of slavery to freedom. Some-
thing that Alex Haley said that night 
hit Harry Reid like a thunderbolt. 
Haley said: ‘‘Be proud of who you are. 
You can’t escape who you are.’’ 
Harry Reid recalled that moment in 
his farewell address to the Senate a lit-
tle over 4 years ago. Harry said: ‘‘I 
walked out of that event that night a 
different person, a new man. From that 
day forward, I would always be Harry 
Reid from Searchlight.’’ 
As his favorite author, Mark Twain, 
might say, that was the day Harry Reid 
found out why he was born. He spent 
the rest of his life after that Alex 
Haley experience—almost half a cen-
tury—climbing the political ladder in 
America to one of its highest rungs but 
using that power to help underdogs 
like the little boy from Searchlight, 
people like his parents, who struggled 
to feed their children, and others who 
felt the crushing hand of fate. 
Harry Reid believed that the Amer-
ican family could come together as a 
government and make life better for 
one another. He believed that wise gov-
ernment decisions gave people an op-
portunity to overcome adversity. Some 
who grew up in poverty and hardship 
and escaped it are so seared by the pain 
of that life that they never want to 
look back. They develop a sort of myo-
pia that seems to make it hard for 
them to even see the struggles of oth-
ers. That was not Harry Reid. 
As a young man, he was a tough mid-
dleweight boxer. As a lawmaker, he 
used his boxer’s instincts to fight for 
others. 
He 
mastered 
the 
arts 
of 
dealmaking and lawmaking to help 
people who work hard and struggle. 
He will go down in history as a Sen-
ate majority leader who helped deliver 
the Affordable Care Act—ObamaCare— 
the most important health and eco-
nomic security advancement in Amer-
ica in 50 years. Thirty-one million 
Americans—1 out of every 10—have 
health insurance today because of 
Obama’s leadership and Harry Reid 
making it a reality. 
His work in the Senate, I witnessed 
personally, day by day by day. I can re-
member so many chapters, days when I 
thought it was over; there was no way. 
Here we were with exactly 60 votes, and 
our friend, a man we both loved, Teddy 
Kennedy was dying. We didn’t know if 
we could get to the finish line in time 
while he was still alive, but Harry was 
determined. He had a bulldog tenacity 
to pass that bill. When he fought for 
the Affordable Care Act, Harry remem-
bered his own life story of how his 
brother had been writhing in agony in 
bed with a broken leg because the fam-
ily couldn’t afford to take him to a 
doctor. Harry used his power to pre-
vent other families from knowing that 
suffering. 
After the great recession of 2009 
robbed millions of Americans of their 
jobs, their homes, and their savings, 
Harry Reid, as majority leader, helped 
pass the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street reforms, to help prevent the 
abuses that led to that crash. 
Nevada is home to many immigrants. 
Senator Harry Reid was a passionate 
advocate of legislation to fix our bro-
ken immigration system. We came to 
the House together, elected in 1982. He 
left just a few years later to come to 
the Senate, and I joined him a few 
years after that, so we had a friendship 
that dated back many years. 
He knew my feelings about immigra-
tion, particularly about the DREAM 
Act. He wasn’t sure of exactly what to 
do until he had two moments in life; 
one, when his wife Landra talked to 
him about that issue and how he had to 
do the right thing and the second was 
when he came to meet the immigrant 
people who were in his State of Nevada 
and hear their life stories. He promised 
me as my friend and as his whip to his 
majority leadership that he would 
bring the DREAM Act to the floor. He 
knew he had to block out the calendar 
to do it, and he knew the chances of 
success were limited, but he was deter-
mined to give me my day here on the 
floor of the Senate. 
He brought the DREAM Act to the 
floor of the Senate in December of 2010.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8 
January 4, 2022 
We had a majority for it. It wasn’t the 
only time we had majority, but, of 
course, we fell short of the 60-vote re-
quirement under the filibuster. 
Then Harry said: What can I do? 
I told him: Harry, we have to reach 
out to our friend and former colleague 
Barack Obama. We have to ask him to 
do everything in his power to use his 
Executive Office to do what we cannot 
accomplish because of the filibuster. 
So we wrote a letter, 22 of us Demo-
crats, to Barack Obama, pleading with 
him to step in and help those wonderful 
young people who were just asking for 
a chance to be part of America’s fu-
ture. Harry’s signature meant a lot as 
majority leader of the Senate. Barack 
Obama said he would help and created 
DACA, and hundreds of thousands of 
people have had their chance to be le-
gally in America and be part of its fu-
ture. 
Harry Reid served in Congress longer 
than any Nevadan in history. He served 
in the Senate for 30 years. He was one 
of only three people to serve 8 years or 
more as Senate majority leader. He 
earned the tribute of our Nation, and it 
will be paid to him this coming week-
end and the following week where his 
body will lie in state in the Rotunda in 
this Capitol that he loved. 
Harry was my colleague, my leader, 
and my friend. Had he not called me 
personally and asked me to consider 
running for whip many years ago, I 
probably wouldn’t have done it. But I 
knew that if he trusted me, I could 
offer my candidacy to the Senate in 
the hopes of being elected as whip. He 
had so many stories to tell. Hardly a 
day would go by where I wouldn’t be in 
his office. He would tell some story 
about growing up, about his high 
school buddies, about his sports experi-
ence, about his wonderful wife Landra, 
about family experiences that always 
were colorful stories. 
One involved one of his brothers who 
got into a fight in a bar in Nevada. His 
brother was outnumbered, and he was 
about to take a beating, when the front 
door of the tavern flung open and Cous-
in Jeff, a big bruiser of a man, walked 
in and took control, saving his brother 
from a beating. I was proud to be called 
‘‘Cousin Jeff’’ by Harry. When he called 
me into political battles to be by his 
side so many times, it was an honor. 
I was with him when he served as ma-
jority and minority whip. Harry was a 
man of extraordinary humility. He was 
the first to admit he wasn’t much of an 
orator, and he would say that his good 
looks didn’t win him into public office. 
But he had a genius for listening to 
people. He listened to the voices of our 
caucus, across the aisle, and across 
America. He managed often to find a 
way forward. He was a modest man. He 
didn’t care who got the credit as long 
as the work was done. 
The only thing that Harry Reid loved 
as much as the Senate and the promise 
of America was his family. Landra is 
such an extraordinary person, Harry’s 
wife of 62 years. They started dating in 
high school, and Harry knew that she 
was the ‘‘one.’’ It took some con-
vincing for her family to come around 
to that point of view, but they did, and 
they had a strong, loving relationship. 
Their children, Rory, Lana, Key, Leif, 
and Josh, and their 19 grandchildren 
were such a great source of pride to 
Harry more than anything. 
I want to extend my sympathy to 
them on my behalf and behalf of my 
wife Loretta, as well as to the talented 
staff members who served Harry Reid 
for so many years, if any of them are 
still here in the Senate. 
Above my desk is a portrait of Presi-
dent Lincoln. And above Harry’s desk 
was a painting of Mark Twain. I was 
confused the first time I saw it because 
I pictured Mark Twain on the Mis-
sissippi, growing up in Missouri. I 
didn’t quite understand the connection. 
In fact, Mark Twain spent the largest 
share of his life in Connecticut, where 
he and his wife raised their family. But 
Harry Reid said that it was while Sam-
uel Clemens was working as a young 
newspaper reporter in Nevada that he 
became ‘‘Mark Twain.’’ It was in Ne-
vada where he first used that pseu-
donym. 
Harry Reid rose to one of the highest 
positions in our government. He met 
with Presidents, Prime Ministers, even 
Monarchs, and this man from Search-
light helped craft and pass some of the 
most important legislation of our time. 
But like Mark Twain, it was in Nevada 
that Harry discovered why he was born. 
He fought for justice and fairness, and 
he always fought for the underdog. He 
was searching for those young people 
like himself who grew up in a hard- 
rock mining town under the toughest 
of circumstances and did their best. He 
wanted to give them the same fighting 
chance he had in life. 
Harry fought the good fight. He fin-
ished the race. America is better for it. 
I will miss my friend. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRERSIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BIPARTISANSHIP 
Mr. CORNYN. Happy New Year. It is 
good to see you and everybody back at 
the beginning of a new year after, I 
hope, a few days of respite and relax-
ation with friends and families and, 
hopefully, we have all had a chance to 
recharge our batteries now for the 
work ahead. 
One of the great things about taking 
a few days off during the holidays is 
you get a chance to reflect on your 
work, your life, your family, what you 
are doing right, what you are doing 
wrong. That is what New Year’s resolu-
tions are all about, changing some of 
those habits that maybe aren’t serving 
us all that well. 
But it is also to sort of reflect on the 
work here in the Senate. And I want to 
start by quoting one of the wisest men 
I knew, and that was my dad. My dad 
said—he had a whole list of aphorisms, 
most of which kind of embarrassed my 
brother and sister and me because they 
were so corny, but some of them were 
pretty shrewd and right on. 
And one of them was that he said the 
hallmark of intelligence is to learn 
from your mistakes. The hallmark of 
intelligence is to learn from your mis-
takes. 
And we are merely human and we all 
make mistakes—we all acknowledge 
that—but learning from our mistakes 
is perhaps the most important thing we 
can do to make progress, to get smart-
er, to learn from experience, and to do 
things better the next time. 
I also thought of another wise man— 
you might call him a genius—Albert 
Einstein, who supposedly said—and I 
can’t vouch for this, but maybe it is 
apocryphal; maybe it is accurate. 
He said: 
The definition of insanity is doing the 
same thing over and over again and expect-
ing different results. 
Insanity is doing the same thing over 
and over again and expecting different 
results. I was reflecting on this—these 
two definitions of intelligence and in-
sanity as I thought about the year past 
and our 50–50 Senate. In 2020, we had a 
historic election, no doubt. Our Demo-
cratic colleagues captured not only the 
White House but the Senate and the 
House of Representatives. 
But what is so amazing about that is 
the lessons that they learned from that 
50–50 election in the Senate and a bare 
majority in the House was very dif-
ferent from what I think, historically, 
people have come to believe that that 
kind of message would send. 
Ordinarily, you would think that— 
well, first of all, this is not the New 
Deal and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt had huge 
majorities in the House and the Senate 
when he passed the New Deal legisla-
tion, historic legislation by any count. 
Conversely, in 2020, when President 
Biden was elected, the American people 
basically said we don’t particularly 
trust either one of the major political 
parties so we are going to divide power 
equally in the Senate and give you a 
bare majority in the House, believing, I 
think, maybe intuitively, if not con-
sciously, that that would force us to 
work together. 
That is not necessarily the first in-
stinct we have when we come here to 
the Senate or the Congress. We want 
what we want. We all run for election. 
We campaign on a platform saying, if 
elected, I am going to do this or that— 
and it is frustrating to not be able to 
do it. 
But the wisdom of our Founders was 
that with the various checks and bal-
ances that we have on unilateral or 
partisan power, that when the voters

January 4, 2022 
say, well, we are going to divide power 
equally in the Senate, you would think 
the conclusion or the lesson that you 
would learn from that is what, histori-
cally, we have come to believe to be 
true, which is that they believe we 
ought to work together and not try to 
do things on our own. 
So you would think that an equally 
divided Senate would encourage the 
majority leader—who is majority lead-
er only by virtue of the fact that Vice 
President HARRIS is the Presiding Offi-
cer of the Senate. She is not actually a 
Member of the Senate, but she can 
break tie votes. 
That is what gives Senator SCHUMER, 
the Senator from New York, his job as 
the majority leader, in spite of the fact 
that we have a 50–50 Senate. 
So you would think that an equally 
divided Chamber would encourage the 
majority leader to prioritize bipartisan 
bills that could win broad support. 
That is what we did last year in the 
last year of the Trump administration. 
We worked together to pass, I think, 
close to $5 trillion of relief from 
COVID–19, this terrible pandemic that 
has gripped the planet for the last 2 
years. 
But, apparently, the majority leader 
reached a different conclusion because 
that is not the type of work that he has 
prioritized in the Chamber during this 
last year. It didn’t start off very well. 
After a wonderful speech by Biden on 
January 20, when he talked about heal-
ing our country, coming together as a 
nation despite our differences, the first 
thing the Democratic-controlled Sen-
ate did is pass a partisan $2 trillion 
spending bill in the name of COVID–19 
relief. 
Well, they omitted to mention that 
only about 10 percent of the money, the 
$2 trillion, on top of the $5 trillion we 
had spent on a bipartisan basis—that 
out of that $2 trillion, only about 10 
percent of it was really related to the 
pandemic, and only 1 percent supported 
vaccinations. Perhaps the single most 
important thing that we have done in 
response to COVID–19 is to make vac-
cinations broadly available, and we 
continue to encourage people to get 
vaccinated, as I do every chance I get. 
But after that first $2 trillion par-
tisan spending bill, our colleagues then 
repeatedly used the Senate’s time, 
which is the most precious asset we 
have here in the Senate, which is floor 
time, to vote on smaller but no less 
problematic bills that really stood zero 
chance of becoming law in a 50–50 Sen-
ate. 
There was one to—in the name of 
paycheck fairness that was, in fact, de-
signed to line the pockets of trial law-
yers, and it didn’t pass. 
Then 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
drafted an election takeover bill. They 
said the only way for us to restore the 
public’s confidence in the voting proc-
ess is for the Federal Government to 
take it over, to hijack it, notwith-
standing the position in the Constitu-
tion that elections should be run at the 
State level. And this election takeover 
bill was so blatantly partisan that even 
Members of the Democratic Senate 
voted against it. 
But they didn’t stop there. They re-
wrote the bill and brought it up for an-
other vote in October, and again it 
failed. Our Democratic colleague, the 
majority leader, has said this partisan 
legislation will resurface again later 
this month. But I don’t expect the out-
come to change because it is the same 
unconstitutional, partisan legislation 
that is not to advance the cause of ac-
cess to the ballot or to enhance voter 
integrity, it is designed to enhance 
Democratic prospects to win elections 
in 2022 and 2024. That is what it is 
about. 
And then there is the multitrillion- 
dollar tax-and-spending bill. And I 
know the Senator from West Virginia 
has been the chief spear catcher when 
it comes to all the criticism associated 
with this legislation, but I have told 
both the Senator from West Virginia 
and the Senator from Arizona that 
there are many Democrats, I believe, 
on the other side of the aisle who are 
grateful to them for preventing a vote 
on this terribly flawed bill in the face 
of rapidly rising inflation. 
I mean, one reason why it costs more 
to fill up your gas tank or to feed your 
family or to buy an appliance is be-
cause of inflation. Prices have been 
going up dramatically. One reason is 
there has been so much money shov-
eled out the door, trillions of dollars. 
We never used to talk in terms of tril-
lions of dollars here in Washington. We 
talked about billions of dollars. 
Everett Dirksen famously said: 
A million here, a million there, and pretty 
soon you’re talking about real money. 
Well, maybe it was a billion, I can’t 
recall specifically, but I know he didn’t 
talk about trillions of dollars. That is 
an innovation of the last couple of 
years. 
I want to commend our colleague 
Senator MANCHIN for his courage in 
stopping this terribly flawed bill for all 
the reasons he and others have men-
tioned. And I hope that is the end of 
this terribly flawed legislation and it 
will force us to do what the Founders 
believed that we would do in the event 
of a 50–50 Senate and that is to work 
together. 
By definition, ‘‘working together,’’ 
means I am not going to get everything 
I want. The Presiding Officer and his 
political party aren’t going to get ev-
erything he wants. That is what con-
sensus means. That is what the Found-
ers intended. And that is what the vot-
ers intended when they gave us a 50–50 
Senate. 
But it is not enough to vote against 
just bad legislation. We have a respon-
sibility to work together when we can 
on bills that Senators from both polit-
ical parties can vote for. That is the 
reason for the so-called filibuster rule, 
60 votes. 
We keep debating until 60 Senators 
say, OK, we are ready to vote. That is 
what creates deliberation and debate 
and consensus building, not elimi-
nating that requirement and then just 
passing bills by a strict majority—bills 
which can, by the way, be undone after 
the next election. 
And just as colleagues on this side of 
the aisle have identified legislation we 
don’t want passed absent an ability to 
build a bipartisan consensus, there is a 
litany of bills that I know our Demo-
cratic 
colleagues 
would 
not 
want 
passed were the shoe on the other foot. 
And I have been here long enough to 
know that eventually the shoe will be 
on the other foot. 
I have always said that I have been in 
the majority and I have been in the mi-
nority and being in the majority is a 
lot better, a lot more enjoyable, a lot 
more productive, from my standpoint. 
But, eventually, the Democratic col-
leagues will be in the minority, per-
haps as soon as after the 2022 election. 
And if 51 votes is all it takes to undo 
things that have been done, well, that 
is exactly what will happen. That has 
been the history of the filibuster that 
has been applied to nominations, not to 
legislation. 
I was here when Senator Harry Reid 
invoked the nuclear option and said: 
We are going to require 60 votes in 
order to confirm judges with a 51-vote 
threshold. And then when that was 
used to block judges on the DC Court of 
Appeals, Senator Reid invoked the nu-
clear option and got them passed by a 
strict partisan majority. 
The Senator from Kentucky, Senator 
MCCONNELL, said: I have been here a 
while, too, and I know what goes 
around comes around. And what we 
have seen come around is three new 
Supreme Court Justices during Donald 
Trump’s time as President of the 
United States. You might call it the 
physics of the Senate. I think it was 
one of Newton’s laws said that for 
every action there is an equal and op-
posite reaction. You might call that 
political physics. 
At the start of this Congress, I prom-
ised my constituents in Texas that I 
would push back against dangerous 
proposals when needed, but I also said, 
in the same sentence, that I would 
work with my Democratic colleagues 
whenever possible, whenever I believed 
it was in the best interest of my 29 mil-
lion constituents. 
And despite the partisanship that has 
gripped this Chamber, we actually have 
made some progress in some areas, not 
that you would read very much about 
it in the newspaper. The nature of news 
is in conflict; it is not consensus. When 
things are consensus, it is not news. It 
is not on cable TV. It doesn’t swirl 
around social media or the internet. 
So we have been able to make some 
progress in some areas. For example, 
last month, the Senate passed the 61st 
annual National Defense Authorization 
Act—the 61st. That means we have 
done it 61 times in a row every year for 
61 years. 
This was good, bipartisan legislation 
and an example of what we can do

January 4, 2022 
when we work together. This legisla-
tion ensures that our servicemembers 
will have the resources they and their 
families need, both on duty and off. It 
makes investments in military con-
struction and our military bases across 
Texas and elsewhere, and it gives our 
commanders and our military leaders 
the certainty they need to plan for the 
future. 
Another example of bipartisanship 
last year, not that many people re-
member or talk about it or write about 
it or hear about it on TV or see it on 
social media, but last summer we 
passed another major bipartisan piece 
of legislation called the U.S. Innova-
tion and Competition Act. This legisla-
tion makes investments in critical sec-
tors to counter threats from China. 
One of the leading proponents of this 
bill was the Senator from New York, 
the majority leader, working prin-
cipally with the Senator from Indiana, 
Senator YOUNG, and others of us. 
One important part of that bill that 
I worked on with the Senator from Vir-
ginia, a Democrat, the senior Senator 
from Virginia, Senator WARNER, was 
funding for programs created by the 
CHIPS Act. It actually became law last 
year, but we had to find a way to pay 
for it, and the Senate stepped up and 
did so, and now we are hoping that the 
House will follow suit. 
But as consumers learned over this 
last year, actually, COVID–19 exposed 
our vulnerability to supply chains from 
overseas. We saw that first with per-
sonal protective equipment, most of 
which—virtually 
all 
of 
which—was 
made in China, and when we needed it 
here, well, we had to try to get it over-
seas from China to the United States 
so that it could protect our healthcare 
heroes, our frontline healthcare pro-
viders, among others. 
But we learned that the vulnerabili-
ties of our supply chains did not stop 
with PPE. Semiconductor shortages, 
for example, have a very real and dra-
matic impact on all of our lives. We 
have seen this in empty car lots, more 
expensive electronics. 
The global semiconductor or micro-
circuit shortage is very visible and has 
had a dramatic impact on our economy 
and threatens our national security be-
cause most of it is made overseas. 
Ninety percent of the semiconductors 
in the world are made in Asia. If you 
take South Korea out of the picture, 63 
percent of them are made in Taiwan— 
Taiwan. 
Yeah, you may have read a little bit 
about Taiwan in the news recently, 
that President Xi has said he wants to 
essentially unify Taiwan with main-
land China, settling an old civil war be-
tween the Nationalists and the Com-
munists that started many years ago. 
But can you imagine what would 
happen if President Xi decided to in-
vade Taiwan and what that would do to 
our supply chain of critical semi-
conductors that operate everything 
from our iPhone to our F–35, fifth gen-
eration stealth fighters? 
Well, our national defense is at 
stake, obviously, too, not just our eco-
nomic future. From advanced fighters, 
quantum computing, and missile de-
fense systems, all of them rely on semi-
conductors. 
We may have read in the public do-
main that Russia and China are now 
touting 
their 
development 
of 
hypersonic 
missiles—missiles 
that 
travel 10 times the speed of sound. 
Well, our ability to defend our Nation 
and defend our allies and help them de-
fend themselves depends on our access 
to these advanced semiconductors that 
make things like missile defense sys-
tems operate. 
But, just for example, a single rocket 
interceptor like the kind that the 
State of Israel has been using to inter-
cept rockets coming into Tel Aviv and 
other major cities, each one of those 
interceptors, which is part of the Iron 
Dome missile defense system, contains 
more than 750 semiconductor chips. 
This is our Achilles’ heel. 
The funding from the U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act will help bolster 
domestic 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing and ensure that we won’t be at 
the mercy of other nations for access 
to critical components of our supply 
chains. This bill is over in the House, 
and 
Speaker 
PELOSI
and 
Majority 
Leader SCHUMER have entered into an 
agreement, which I hope will be con-
summated, that, in February, we will 
have a conference on that bill and pass, 
I hope, that CHIPS for America Act, 
together with the other efforts we have 
made 
to 
strengthen 
our 
defenses 
against a more aggressive People’s Re-
public of China. 
Well, we don’t have much time to 
waste because we know one of the pre-
eminent challenges that we have in the 
world today is not terrorism, like we 
experienced after 9/11. On 9/11 and 
thereafter we were focused like a laser 
on counterterrorism. Meanwhile, Rus-
sia and China continued to rebuild and 
replenish their arsenals and develop 
new 
and 
dangerous 
weapons 
that 
threaten our national security and, in 
the end, threaten our freedom. 
In addition to these big, bipartisan 
bills that I have mentioned, I was glad 
that a number of bills that I introduced 
became law last year. 
After years of fighting, we finally 
succeeded in making Juneteenth a na-
tional holiday. Juneteenth started in 
Galveston, TX, when, 2 years after the 
Civil War was over, the former slaves 
in Galveston were told: You are free. 
We have been celebrating that for 40 
years in Texas, and I am proud to say 
we have now made this a national holi-
day. Hopefully, this will be a source of 
education and reconciliation, and so 
people will understand our history be-
cause, as the old saying goes: Those 
who don’t remember their history are 
condemned to relive it. 
This would not have happened with-
out the support and the tenacity of ad-
vocates across Texas, including my 
friend Ms. Opal Lee of Fort Worth, who 
is widely known as the grandmother of 
Juneteenth. 
By the way, the Dallas Morning News 
editorial board named her as the 
woman of the year for last year, quite 
an appropriate recognition. 
But this bill and this holiday will 
preserve the history of Juneteenth for 
generations to come and ensure that 
we never forget the significance of that 
day 
when 
Major 
General 
Gordon 
Granger’s troops declared that all 
slaves are forever free. 
Then we passed bipartisan bills to 
strengthen the policies and procedures 
for reporting missing servicemembers, 
something very near and dear to those 
of us in Texas, given the terrible and 
tragic loss of Vanessa Guillen. 
We also strengthened our defense 
against China by strengthening our re-
lationship with Taiwan. 
We passed bipartisan legislation en-
suring that for Federal officers—no 
matter where they serve—that their 
attackers, their killers can be brought 
to justice. 
For border States, like the Presiding 
Officer’s and mine, we have modernized 
and increased staffing at points of 
entry at our borders with Mexico, with-
out spending taxpayer dollars. 
We have also closed a loophole 
abused by some companies fueling the 
opioid epidemic. 
Again, I could go on and on, but these 
are just a few of the bipartisan bills 
that I was privileged to work on and 
that were signed into law last year. 
When you add the bipartisan bills in-
troduced by our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, it adds up to a lot of 
bipartisan wins for the American peo-
ple. Again, you don’t read about it 
much in the paper, you don’t see it 
much on cable TV or read about it on 
social media, but it is real and it is 
true. It is true, and it is what I think 
we were sent here to do. 
So my conclusion is perhaps an obvi-
ous one: that even in an equally di-
vided Senate, if we try, if maybe we re-
sist our impulse to go it alone, we can 
actually work together and find bipar-
tisan solutions. 
One of our former colleagues, Mike 
Enzi, who passed away in the recent 
past—when I came to the Senate, he 
was on the Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions Committee with the lib-
eral lion of the Senate, Teddy Kennedy. 
You know, I came here to the Senate, 
and I was kind of in awe of the people 
I had seen on television, and, particu-
larly, the Kennedy family, who had 
served our Nation in so many different 
capacities. But I asked Mike Enzi, who 
was perhaps one of the most conserv-
ative Members of the Senate, how he 
and Teddy Kennedy, one of the most 
liberal Members of the Senate, could 
work together and actually pass legis-
lation. 
He said: It is easy. It is called the 80– 
20 rule. You find the 80 percent of what 
you can agree on, and then you leave 
the 20 percent for another day and an-
other fight. Depending on your view-
point, it can either be a recipe for grid-
lock or a really big opportunity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S11 
January 4, 2022 
And I have subscribed to the wisdom 
of the 80–20 rule. From what I have 
seen, I believe the Presiding Officer 
agrees with that as well. 
So instead of just focusing on the 
things we can’t agree on and perhaps 
will never agree on, because we have 
different visions for the role of the Fed-
eral Government in our lives—that is 
OK. Those are the debates we have 
been having since the founding of this 
country, and we will have forever, as 
long as this great Nation lasts. 
But let’s not just focus on the 20 per-
cent we can’t do, which seems to be the 
obsession of the news media and oth-
ers. Let’s think more about the 80 per-
cent we can do. Rather than waste 
floor time, which is coin of the realm 
here—I mean, if it can’t come to the 
floor because there is no floor time, it 
is not going to happen. So rather than 
waste time on partisan bills that will 
ultimately go nowhere, let’s find com-
mon ground and work on our shared 
priorities. 
I have got one idea. How do we help 
families struggling to keep up with the 
highest inflation in nearly four dec-
ades? I have lived long enough to know 
when interest rates were close to 20 
percent and we had double-digit infla-
tion. It was a miserable time in this 
country because people’s paychecks 
were eaten up by inflation and they 
couldn’t afford to buy things, like 
houses, that they ordinarily might buy 
to increase their standard of living be-
cause interest rates were so high on 
mortgage loans. 
Or let’s work on supply chains that 
have been unable to keep up with de-
mand. The vulnerabilities have been 
exposed by COVID–19. Again, the defi-
nition of intelligence, as my dad used 
to say, what he called the hallmark of 
intelligence, is learning from your mis-
takes, not doing the same thing over 
and over again, like Albert Einstein 
said, and expecting different results. 
There is also a humanitarian crisis 
on the border that has led to the high-
est number of annual apprehensions on 
record. 
I am not confident our colleagues on 
the other side actually believe in en-
forcing our immigration laws, but 
maybe I am wrong. Maybe there are 
some areas that we could work on. The 
Senator from Arizona, Senator SINEMA, 
and I, and HENRY CUELLAR, a Democrat 
from Laredo, and TONY GONZALES, a 
Republican 
from 
Texas, 
we 
have 
worked on the Bipartisan Border Solu-
tions Act, and we would love to be able 
to work with our colleagues across the 
aisle to find some way to address the 
uncontrolled access that people who 
have no reasonable grounds for asylum 
are getting and coming into our coun-
try and then fading into the great 
American landscape. 
There are other things I would like 
to do in the immigration space, things 
like the Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals. Ten years ago, President 
Obama issued an Executive memo-
randum 
saying 
that 
if 
you 
were 
brought here as a child, under certain 
criteria, you will be able to stay and 
you will be able to get work permits. 
But it has been in litigation for the 
last 10 years. The last decision by a 
Federal district judge in Houston, TX, 
Judge Hanen, said that basically the 
DACA and DAPA—in this case, the 
DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals—memorandum is unconstitu-
tional and that only Congress can ad-
dress this. 
And I suggest we should. I have asked 
the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee to put a bill on the floor in the 
Judiciary Committee that provides 
some certainty in the future for these 
young people, who are now young 
adults, living in uncertainty. Give 
them some certainty and some comfort 
knowing that they don’t need to fear 
deportation or some other negative 
consequence, because I believe there is 
a broad consensus that we ought to 
give them some relief. 
In America you don’t hold children 
responsible for the mistakes parents 
make, and I believe that we could find 
a bipartisan solution to at least that 
part. And do you know what? Maybe— 
just maybe—by doing some things to-
gether, we can increase confidence 
among ourselves. 
Yeah, we really can. We can work to-
gether. We can find bipartisan solu-
tions. We don’t have to just fight and 
emphasize the 20 percent we can’t 
agree on. We can work on that 80 per-
cent and make real progress. 
I believe these are the types of issues 
that the American people sent us here 
to solve. Forget legislation that hands 
tax breaks to the wealthy or federal-
izes 
America’s 
elections, 
notwith-
standing the provisions of our Con-
stitution. Let’s work together to solve 
real problems where there is an oppor-
tunity for us to find that 80-percent so-
lution. 
So, as we welcome the start of a new 
year, I hope the Democratic leader, 
Senator SCHUMER, and our colleagues 
across the aisle will look at the 50–50 
Senate with a fresh perspective. We do 
have an opportunity to deliver big wins 
to the American people this year, and I 
hope the Senate majority leader, who 
sets the agenda on the floor, will allow 
that to happen. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JOHNNY ISAKSON 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
begin, I want to express my deep sor-
row at the death of former Senator 
Johnny Isakson. I served with Johnny 
for a long time, not just here in the 
Senate, where we came in together as 
freshman Members in 2005, but also in 
the House of Representatives, and I 
was honored to call him my friend. 
Johnny was a tremendously effective 
legislator and, in particular, a cham-
pion for veterans and a model of de-
cency and graciousness. When I came 
down to the floor to discuss his retire-
ment 2 years ago, I read a quote from 
a politics professor in Georgia that I 
thought really captured Johnny. I 
think so still. Here is what that pro-
fessor had to say: 
As a political science professor and an ad-
ministrator, I’m often asked by students if 
good people can serve in government and 
keep their integrity. Johnny Isakson is al-
ways the first example I come to. It’s very 
often a shocking revelation to most people— 
that good people can, and often do, serve in 
government for long periods, fight hard for 
what they believe in, and remain true to 
themselves and their principles. And they 
don’t have to sell their souls to do it. It’s a 
great lesson, really. 
Mr. President, that was Johnny—a 
good man, one of the best I have ever 
known. He came to Washington to 
serve his State and his country and 
served them faithfully throughout his 
life. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
Johnny’s wife Dianne and with his chil-
dren and grandchildren. 
REMEMBERING HARRY REID 
Mr. President, I also want to mention 
the loss of former Senate Democratic 
leader Harry Reid, who also passed 
away this Christmas, and also extend 
my thoughts and prayers to his wife 
Landra and his family. 
2021 
Mr. President, the end of 2021 marks 
the end of a year of Democratic govern-
ance, and the picture is sobering. If we 
were issuing a report card for 2021, I am 
afraid Democrats would earn a ‘‘D’’ for 
‘‘dreadful’’ or ‘‘disaster’’ or an ‘‘F’’ for 
‘‘failure’’ because 2021 was filled with 
one Democratic-led crisis after an-
other. 
Take our current inflation crisis. 
When Democrats took office last Janu-
ary, inflation was well within an ac-
ceptable range or what is known as the 
target inflation rate. It might have 
stayed there had Democrats not de-
cided they needed to pass a massive 
government spending spree under the 
guise of COVID relief mere weeks after 
Congress had already passed a major 
COVID bill. 
That is right. In December of 2020, 
Congress passed its fifth bipartisan 
COVID relief bill, a nearly $1 trillion 
piece of legislation that met essen-
tially all current, pressing COVID 
needs. But the ink was barely dry on 
the page before Democrats decided that 
they needed to take advantage of the 
COVID situation to pass another bill— 
this time, a hyperpartisan $1.9 trillion 
piece of legislation packed with unnec-
essary government spending and pay-
offs to Democratic interest groups. 
That unnecessary government spend-
ing, 
of 
course, 
had 
serious 
con-
sequences. 
The definition of ‘‘inflation’’ is too 
many dollars chasing too few goods and

January 4, 2022 
services, and that is exactly the situa-
tion Democrats created. They sent too 
many Federal dollars into the econ-
omy, and the economy overheated as a 
result. 
Since Democrats passed their so- 
called American Rescue Plan, inflation 
has gone up and up again. In Novem-
ber, inflation hit its highest level in 
nearly 40 years—40 years—and Amer-
ican families are dealing with the con-
sequences: spikes in food prices, rent 
prices, utility prices, used car and 
truck prices, propane, kerosene, and 
firewood prices, and the list goes on. 
Inflation is so bad that despite wage 
growth in 2021, Americans saw a de 
facto pay cut. 
You would think that the economic 
pain Americans are experiencing would 
be giving Democrats pause, but in fact, 
despite massive inflation, Democrats 
have been trying to double down on the 
reckless spending strategy that helped 
cause so much inflation in the first 
place. Fortunately, they have so far 
been unable to summon a majority in 
the Senate to support their latest reck-
less spending plan, but their unconcern 
with the dangerous economic con-
sequences of their proposed new spend-
ing spree is deeply troubling. 
I wish I could say that our inflation 
crisis was the only Democratic disaster 
to come out of 2021, but that wouldn’t 
be true. Democrats have also presided 
over a massive crisis at our southern 
border—a crisis that Democrats are ap-
parently completely content to ignore. 
The illegal migration across our south-
ern border picked up in the wake of the 
President’s inauguration and reached 
stratospheric levels in 2021. 
The crisis shows no signs of abating. 
In November, the latest month for 
which we have statistics, Customs and 
Border Protection encountered 173,620 
people attempting to cross our south-
ern border illegally. That is well over 
double the number who tried to cross 
illegally in November of 2020 and more 
than four times the number who at-
tempted to cross in November of 2019. 
But you would never know it from lis-
tening to the President or congres-
sional Democrats. It has become very 
clear that the President doesn’t care 
about what is happening at our south-
ern border despite the very real secu-
rity and humanitarian crisis that this 
massive wave of illegal immigration 
represents. 
But our ongoing inflation and border 
disasters still don’t represent the total 
of Democrats’ 2021 failures. There was 
also the President’s disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan. 
The President’s arbitrary, chaotic 
withdrawal was a real low point for our 
country. Thirteen of our military men 
and women died in a terrorist attack 
during the evacuation of Kabul. We 
abandoned thousands of individuals 
who had worked with us in Afghanistan 
and whom we had promised to protect. 
They are bracing for life under the bru-
tal control of the Taliban, if they 
haven’t been forced into hiding or met 
an even more grim fate. The President 
also left behind hundreds of American 
citizens, and the latest report suggests 
that some of them may still be trying 
to find a way out of the country. 
Meanwhile, the President, who was 
supposed to restore our standing on the 
world stage, left our allies wondering if 
our word could be relied on. 
Most of all, the President’s disas-
trous withdrawal has left our country 
in a more precarious national security 
position. Afghanistan is well on its way 
to once again becoming a terrorist 
haven. But, as with our border crisis, 
the dangers of our current Afghanistan 
situation barely seem to register on 
the President’s radar. 
I could go on and talk about how the 
President, who promised to be a Presi-
dent for all Americans, has instead 
been a President for the far-left wing of 
the Democratic Party. I could talk 
about how congressional Democrats, 
despite holding a razor-thin majority 
in Congress, have governed in a relent-
lessly partisan and extreme manner, 
attempting to force through far-left 
legislation, including a Federal take-
over of election law and perhaps the 
most radical abortion legislation ever 
considered in Congress. I could talk 
about how Democrats are even now 
plotting to overturn a decades-old Sen-
ate rule in an attempt to force their 
partisan priorities through the Senate. 
But I will stop this discussion here. 
Thanks to Democrats’ disasters, 2021 
was a very rough year for the country. 
I would love to think that Democratic 
governance in 2022 would be better, 
that Democrats would get serious 
about inflation, abandon their plans for 
another reckless spending spree, ad-
dress our border crisis, and commit to 
bipartisanship, 
but 
given 
the 
way 
things have been going, I am not get-
ting my hopes up. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, before I close, I want 
to take a moment to comment on the 
situation in Ukraine. 
Tensions remain dangerously high as 
Russia has amassed a reported 100,000 
troops on Ukraine’s border. This, of 
course, is just the latest aggressive 
move by Russia, which already ille-
gally annexed Crimea in 2014 and has 
been supporting separatist forces in the 
Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. 
It may have been overlooked during 
the busy holiday season, but I would 
like to note for the record a bipartisan, 
bicameral virtual meeting that oc-
curred on the morning of Christmas 
Eve 
with 
Ukrainian 
President 
Zelensky. I participated in this meet-
ing, which enabled us to discuss the 
current 
security 
situation 
directly 
with President Zelensky. 
We discussed the importance of the 
more than $21⁄2 billion in security as-
sistance the United States has provided 
since 2014, including $300 million in the 
latest National Defense Authorization 
Act. But given the urgency of the situ-
ation, the Biden administration must 
consider additional emergency assist-
ance at this critical time, and security 
assistance must also be backed by 
strong sanctions to deter any further 
Russian advances. 
Unfortunately, President Biden has 
already given Russia a pass on one of 
Vladimir Putin’s top priorities: the 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. I have spoken 
before about the European security 
risk and economic harm to Ukraine 
that will be caused by Nord Stream 2. 
Yet President Biden has not enforced 
sanctions related to the pipeline—man-
datory sanctions, I might add—that are 
required by law. 
Per an agreement made prior to the 
Christmas break, the Senate will soon 
have a vote on these sanctions, and the 
message to Russia and President Putin 
must be clear: Don’t interfere with the 
aspirations of Ukraine, and let Ukraine 
determine its future by the will of its 
people. 
This is not a case of the United 
States and NATO looking to push east; 
this is a former Soviet state seeking to 
cast off Russia’s grip, assert its sov-
ereignty, and, of its own accord, align 
itself with the ideals of freedom and 
embrace peace and prosperity as a free 
and independent nation. 
The United States should stand with 
Ukraine and against Russia’s aggres-
sion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

ANNIVERSARY OF JANUARY 6 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, a year 
ago, there was an attempted overthrow 
of American democracy right here in 
this building. You know, we spend so 
much time here arguing about things 
that are unknowable—about the fu-
ture, about our ideology, about opin-
ions—that we have become accustomed 
to treating floor speeches in the Senate 
as not primarily about facts. 
But I was here. And by ‘‘I was here,’’ 
I don’t mean I was here in the Capitol. 
I mean, I was right here at this desk. 
And so no one needs to characterize it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S13 
January 4, 2022 
for me or pontificate about it or tell 
me what I think happened. I was right 
here. It wasn’t theoretical. It wasn’t a 
debate. It was a physical siege on the 
U.S. Capitol. 
I was already angry that day. The 
idea that American—American—demo-
cratically elected politicians would 
participate in a process so foul as to be 
worthy of our most autocratic adver-
saries had me in a sour mood. The elec-
toral college certification is supposed 
to be the functional equivalent of a 
swearing-in. It is where the thing gets 
made official, but it is not like any de-
cisions are supposed to be made that 
day. But Senators HAWLEY and CRUZ 
and others, with their unlimited ambi-
tion, their big brains, and their sup-
posed expertise in the Constitution, 
were dancing on the edge of over-
turning democracy itself. 
But I actually had no idea how bad it 
was, that there was an ongoing orga-
nized conspiracy to steal the election 
for real, not in a ‘‘Russian hacking’’ 
kind of a way or not in a ‘‘too many of 
the people I don’t agree with voted’’ 
kind of way—actually overturning the 
whole thing. 
So no one needs to tell me how to in-
terpret this. I was there when they 
yelled: ‘‘Lock down, lock down.’’ I was 
here when Mike Pence was ushered off 
the floor. I was here when CHUCK 
GRASSLEY and anyone else with a per-
sonal protection detail was rushed to 
safety, and the rest of us were just 
locked in here and told to stay in our 
seats. 
I was here when Senator TODD YOUNG 
made himself ready to physically con-
front the violent traitors. I was here 
when we were finally moved to an un-
disclosed location and LINDSEY GRAHAM 
yelled at the Capitol Police leadership 
for not having a plan to handle such a 
moment. 
And I was here when Reverend Black 
pulled us together in unity. And I was 
here when all but a few of us decided 
enough is enough, and we were collec-
tively determined to finish our work 
and finish the count that evening. 
We were perilously close to losing ev-
erything that night. And some did. Po-
lice officers were maimed and killed. 
Custodial workers and Senate staffers 
were hiding, with zero protection. 
The insurrectionists were explicit. 
They wanted to kill the Speaker of the 
House. 
One year later should be a simple, 
solemn commemoration of what hap-
pened and a collective, unified deter-
mination to never let anything like 
that ever happen again. 
But I am even more worried now be-
cause that moment of unity is gone, 
and, most importantly, that moment of 
moral clarity of collective, patriotic 
outrage is fading. It went from Repub-
licans being apologetic about their 
President to voting to exonerate him. 
It went from Republicans being angry 
at him and denouncing him to voting 
against putting a bipartisan commis-
sion together to get all of the facts out. 
It went from 99 percent of the public 
being crystal clear about the moral 
threat to the right rewriting history 
and, in some cases, the left going along 
with it by telling us that some issues 
poll better. 
To be clear, the litmus test for both 
political parties is, to greater or lesser 
degrees, the extent to which one is 
loyal to the President—fair enough. 
That is how the modern two-party sys-
tem works, for better or worse. 
But Donald Trump is now defining fe-
alty to him by one thing and one thing 
only: Are you willing to install him 
into power regardless of the vote 
count? 
And so now every Republican politi-
cian and elected official—secretaries of 
state, county election commissioners, 
U.S. Senate candidates—have to prom-
ise to put Trump above democracy 
itself. And many are doing it. They are 
now organizing the next coup in plain 
sight. 
Now, I don’t know the economics or 
the psychology behind it. Maybe, it is 
ratings. Maybe, it is just the natural 
tendency among the chattering class to 
not want to sound too wild-eyed—that 
being unworried is what passes for 
savvy in this town. But everyone, in-
cluding those who consider themselves 
patriots, seem so chill about what is 
going on that I am genuinely alarmed. 
They are installing loyalists across the 
country in order to cheat, and they are 
not being subtle about it. 
Meanwhile, the cocktail set in Wash-
ington is busy policing our tone and 
talking about Democratic overreach, 
and so the defining question this week 
and this year is this: Are we willing to 
face the challenge in front of us? 
Yes, there is COVID. Yes, there is cli-
mate. But democracy itself is at risk in 
a way that we haven’t seen in cen-
turies, and we are standing around as a 
country arguing about mostly non-
sense. 
And I think here is the problem for 
all of us, and here is why this is so hard 
emotionally: If we take a moment to 
realize what is at stake, we might real-
ize what is required. It will require Re-
publicans to stand up to an autocrat. It 
will require Democrats to stop arguing 
amongst themselves. It will require re-
porters to write stories that get fewer 
clicks than whatever BS is driving the 
news of the day. It will require citizens 
to understand that democracy in this 
country is not what we have. It is what 
we do, and it is never guaranteed. 
So, this week, we commemorate the 
fallen. We thank everyone who came to 
democracy’s defense across the country 
and in our great Capital City. But we 
know that this was round 1. We know 
that authoritarians rarely give up, and 
we know that they aren’t doing their 
preparation for the next coup in hiding. 
They are doing it all in plain sight, and 
they must be stopped. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
REMEMBERING HARRY REID 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
today, I rise to pay tribute to Senate 
Majority Leader Harry Reid, a cham-
pion for Nevada. He was one of the 
most powerful, dedicated, and effective 
advocates that my home State has ever 
seen. He worked for the benefit of Ne-
vadans for almost 50 years in both 
State and national politics. Everyone 
living in the Silver State today has 
benefited from his wise and tenacious 
efforts. 
But before Harry Reid was my Sen-
ator and the Senator for the State of 
Nevada, he was a neighbor to my fam-
ily. He was a mentor and a friend. 
Now, I grew up in Las Vegas, just 
down the street from the Reid family, 
and my sister and I attended public 
school with their oldest son, Rory. And 
the entire Cortez family and Masto 
family and I want to send our condo-
lences to his beautiful wife Landra; his 
children, Lana Reid Barringer, Rory, 
Leif, Josh, and Key; and his 19 grand-
children and his great-grandchildren. 
Harry Reid was irreplaceable, not 
just to them but to so many people, in-
cluding me and many of my colleagues 
in this Chamber. He was unfailingly 
supportive of me throughout my entire 
time in public service. 
You know, I remember when I first 
decided to run for the office of Ne-
vada’s attorney general. One of the 
first people I called was Senator Reid, 
and I asked him for advice. I asked him 
for advice on running for office because 
it was the first time I had ever run for 
any type of office, and I had chosen to 
take on a statewide campaign. Not 
only was he supportive, but he was can-
did in his comments—as only Harry 
can be—about campaigning, the types 
of individuals working in the campaign 
world, and what to beware of, of those 
working in that campaign world. His 
advice still rings true today. 
When I was serving, and fortunate 
enough to be elected statewide as the 
attorney general, Senator Reid was al-
ways available for a call. And he never 
forgot about Nevada and working with 
everybody in Nevada from his seat here 
as a majority leader. 
I remember one time, as the attorney 
general, I got a call from a Senator 
here in the U.S. Senate, and the Sen-
ator said to me: I was just talking to 
Senator Reid, and there is an issue 
that came up that I would like to focus 
on, but Senator Reid said: You better 
call my attorney general first in Ne-
vada to make sure that she and the 
State of Nevada are supportive of it. 
And to this day, I now serve with that 
Senator. I will never forget getting a 
call from a U.S. Senator, as a sitting 
attorney general, to talk about an 
issue that was important for Nevada 
because Senator Reid knew what was 
important for him and his State. 
He also had this uncanny ability to 
call you at just the right time, when 
you needed support or encouragement, 
when you needed advice or just some-
one to commiserate with. We all know

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S14 
January 4, 2022 
he didn’t like to stay on the phone 
long, but he knew when you needed 
him, and he would be there. He was a 
compassionate and kind man, a side of 
him that many people did not see but 
many people also benefited from great-
ly over the years. It is my incredible 
honor to be able to hold the seat he oc-
cupied so well for so long. 
Harry Reid accomplished so much as 
a Nevada Senator. Born in the little 
town of Searchlight, NV, he knew his 
home State better than anyone. He un-
derstood that Nevada was a microcosm 
of our country. He knew that Nevada’s 
diversity mirrored this Nation’s, and 
that is why Senator Reid worked to 
give Nevada a greater role in deciding 
each party’s nominee for President. He 
wanted to ensure that a State as di-
verse and dynamic as Nevada played an 
important role in choosing America’s 
leaders. 
Harry Reid also understood Nevada’s 
landscapes, from the desert outside of 
Searchlight that so many of us have 
heard about to the snowy peaks of the 
Ruby Mountains in winter, to the glis-
tening waters of Lake Tahoe. He was a 
dedicated environmentalist who helped 
conserve Nevada’s abundant national 
treasures, keeping our State beautiful 
for future generations and protecting 
outdoor 
recreation 
that 
fuels 
our 
State’s economy. 
And we all know he would not back 
down from a fight, especially when it 
involved Nevada; whether that was 
blocking every effort to dump nuclear 
waste at Yucca Mountain without Ne-
vada’s agreement or advocating for 
Federal funding to help upgrade Ne-
vada’s schools, airports, roads and 
bridges, he was relentless in his push to 
get our State the resources that we de-
served. 
Harry Reid was as diligent in sup-
porting Nevada’s rural and Tribal com-
munities as he was in building up our 
world-class cities. He helped create Ne-
vada’s booming clean energy economy 
and make the State a destination for 
those looking to build an innovative, 
sustainable future. 
The changes that he helped set in 
motion were so far-reaching that they 
allowed Nevada to benefit from the in-
novation economy of the 21st century. 
He paved the way for us. It isn’t just 
Nevadans who are better off because of 
Harry Reid; the entire country gained 
because of his hard work and his dedi-
cation. He helped rescue the country 
by getting America through the great 
recession, taking extra care to support 
the hospitality and tourism economies 
that are so vital to the economy and 
the jobs in Nevada. 
He was instrumental in protecting 
Nevada’s and the Nation’s Dreamers 
and immigrant families. 
In his crowning legislative achieve-
ment, he fought tirelessly to get mil-
lions of Americans access to affordable 
healthcare. His work was key to ensur-
ing that the Affordable Care Act be-
came law, lowering healthcare costs 
and giving access to high-quality care 
to millions who didn’t have it before. 
Harry Reid was a great American, 
but first and foremost, he was a great 
Nevadan. He never forgot where he 
came from, and there is no doubt in my 
mind that is what motivated him every 
single day. As Nevada’s son, he made a 
tremendous difference for our State 
and for every American. He was a won-
derful friend and a true public servant 
and for that we will miss him in the 
Senate and across the Nation. 
TRIBUTE TO CLINTON JEROME HILL 
Mr. President, I would also like to 
talk a little bit today about another 
incredible American whom I have come 
to know. Both my husband and I, Paul 
and I, got to know this individual over 
the years. He has become a friend. He 
is an incredible American, and today is 
his birthday. His name is Clinton Je-
rome Hill. 
Clint is a true hero, the iconic Secret 
Service agent who jumped onto a mov-
ing car while bullets flew in an effort 
to save President Kennedy from an as-
sassin. 
Born on this day in 1932, Clint Hill 
grew up in the tiny town of Washburn, 
ND. He was a good student; he loved 
music; and he was an outstanding ath-
lete. Clint went on to attend Concordia 
College in Moorhead, MN, where he was 
a standout football and baseball player, 
graduating in 1954. 
Though Clint had visions of being a 
history teacher and athletics coach, he 
was drafted immediately into the U.S. 
Army, where he worked in counter-
intelligence in an Army field office in 
Denver, CO. 
In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisen-
hower happened to be in Colorado on 
vacation when the President suffered a 
heart attack and was hospitalized for 7 
weeks. That is when Clint ended up 
meeting several members of Eisen-
hower’s Secret Service detail. He was 
deeply impressed with the dignity and 
demeanor of these fine men. At that 
time, there were just 269 agents in the 
entire Secret Service organization and, 
in 1958, Clint became one of them. 
A year later, Agent Hill was assigned 
to the White House at age 27. He was 
one of a handful of men responsible for 
protecting the President of the United 
States. In 1959 and 1960, Clint Hill trav-
eled with President Eisenhower on his 
goodwill tours to Europe, Asia, India, 
the Middle East, and South America. 
When John F. Kennedy was elected 
President in 1960, Clint was assigned to 
protect the First Lady, Jacqueline 
Kennedy. Both President and Mrs. Ken-
nedy were fond of Agent Hill and trust-
ed him implicitly. Wherever Mrs. Ken-
nedy went, Clint Hill was by her side. 
And so it was that Agent Hill accom-
panied President and Mrs. Kennedy to 
Texas on November 22, 1963. Clint was 
present at the horrifying moment in 
Dealey Plaza when President Kennedy, 
riding in an open convertible, was shot. 
Clint immediately began to run toward 
the President’s car to protect him, and 
many of us have seen that dramatic 
footage: Jackie Kennedy extending her 
hand back to Agent Hill, who leapt 
onto the back of the moving car and 
jumped into the vehicle as it sped away 
to Parkland Hospital in Dallas. 
After President Kennedy’s tragic as-
sassination, Clint Hill continued to 
protect Jacqueline Kennedy and her 
two children. Then, in 1964, he was 
transferred back to the White House. 
And in 1967, he became the Special 
Agent in Charge of Presidential Protec-
tion for President Lyndon Johnson. 
Throughout 1968, Clint was a Secret 
Service agent who had LBJ’s back. 
Clint Hill devoted his life to the Se-
cret Service, ultimately being pro-
moted to Assistant Director in Charge 
of all Protective Forces. He was mar-
ried, had two sons, but like so many 
selfless 
Secret 
Service 
agents, 
he 
missed countless holidays, anniver-
saries, and birthdays. 
In 1975, Clint retired from the Secret 
Service, a job and organization that he 
loved. In the years since, he has writ-
ten three best-selling books about his 
work with his coauthor and now wife, 
Lisa McCubbin. 
Today is Clint’s 90th birthday. So, 
today, I want to pay tribute to a true 
American hero, a man who was willing 
to put his life on the line, not once but 
time and again to protect our leaders. 
Now, I know something of the sac-
rifice this involves. My husband Paul is 
a retired Secret Service agent, and I 
am familiar with the commitment it 
takes for an agent to walk out that 
door every day to defend the President 
from threats. So on behalf of Paul, my-
self, the entire Masto family, we want 
to wish a happy birthday to our friend 
Clint Hill. Thank you for your service 
to our country and our sincere best 
wishes for many more wonderful years 
ahead. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
know that you are probably like me 
and you have been grateful for the time 
to be home and to see family and 
friends and just to chat with them 
about what is going on in their lives 
and the issues that are important to 
them, what they are looking at. It has 
been so interesting to get their per-
spective as we have visited. 
I flipped through the papers yester-
day, and I realize that many of our 
friends around town have this renewed 
sense of optimism about President 
Biden’s ability to lead the country. I 
found that really quite interesting. 
You could look at it and say: It may be 
a new year, but it is the same old 
Biden. 
It goes without saying that I do not 
share what I see as a misguided view. I 
entered 
this 
year 
with 
the

January 4, 2022 
healthy skepticism that I had back in 
December as we were finishing that 
legislative year. I will say this; that for 
the past year, the Democratic majority 
has indulged an administration that 
has treated their electoral victory like 
a mandate to enact some of the most 
irresponsible and radical policies we 
have seen in over a generation. 
Now they are dusting off an agenda 
that is so unhinged, it has kept the 
Democrats deadlocked against one an-
other for the year. We have seen this 
agenda breed mistrust, tension, and 
anger between the American people 
and their government. Few, if any, of 
those people could state that they are 
better off now than they were under 
President Trump and Republican lead-
ership. But still, the Democratic ma-
jority has continued to push Biden’s 
agenda on behalf of the most radical 
portions of their base. 
Yes, leaning left—they are leaning 
far left. They are listening to the social 
justice warriors and the climate par-
tisans and the Big Government activ-
ists, and the Democratic leadership is 
doing exactly what they are telling 
them they want done. Meanwhile, they 
are ignoring the people back home who 
actually have to deal with the con-
sequences of this political tunnel vi-
sion. 
Time after time in poll after poll, 
even more polls that have come out 
today, the American people have made 
it abundantly clear that they are not 
just dissatisfied with the President’s 
failure to lead, with his radical agen-
da—you know what, they are not just 
angry. What I learned from Ten-
nesseans is that people are really 
frightened by what they see taking 
place with this far-left, hard-left turn. 
President Biden has to know all of 
this. The Democratic leadership has to 
know all of this. Look at all the polls. 
It doesn’t matter if it is NPR, it 
doesn’t matter if it is AP, it doesn’t 
matter if it is CNN, the agenda, the 
President, the Vice President—they are 
all underwater. I think they have prob-
ably seen this coming since day one of 
this disastrous administration. 
Take some of the specific issues. The 
Democratic leadership has had a front 
row seat to what is happening on the 
southern border. So has the adminis-
tration. There has been a complete col-
lapse of our Nation’s sovereignty at the 
southern border. With the stroke of a 
pen, President Biden dismantled the 
policies that were keeping us safe. He 
invited waves of illegal immigrants 
into the country, said: Y’all come. 
Y’all come. We are ready for you. 
He threw the Border Patrol and local 
law enforcement under the bus, did not 
listen to them. You don’t have to take 
my word for it. Go to the southern bor-
der. Go visit with them. 
He has let the cartel step into the 
leadership void at the southern border. 
The drug dealers and the human traf-
fickers are in control of the southern 
border at this point in time. You do 
not cross that border unless you have 
paid the cartels. But you know what, 
admitting this does not fit the agenda 
of the Democratic leadership, so they 
just ignore it. Now, President Biden 
and my Democratic colleagues con-
tinue to evade responsibility for keep-
ing the border secure and safeguarding 
the national security. They don’t want 
to talk about that. 
They are also not wanting to talk 
about the threat posed by the Chinese 
Communist Party and our other adver-
saries abroad. And that is right—the 
Chinese Communist Party is an adver-
sary. They are not a competitor. They 
are not a friend or a frenemy. They are 
an adversary. What are they doing? 
They are conducting surveillance, aca-
demic espionage, and intellectual prop-
erty theft. They are doing this every 
single day. It is all part of the standing 
operating procedures of the new axis of 
evil and all being ignored by people 
who are charged with running this 
country, keeping this country safe. 
Tennesseans will tell you they are 
very concerned. The American people 
are very concerned. The polls are show-
ing it. And they are blaming the Biden 
administration for not feeling safe, not 
feeling secure, for the supply chain cri-
sis, for inflation. These are all things 
that have been brought about in the 
past year by decisions this administra-
tion has made, Executive orders they 
have executed. 
Every time people in this country 
pick up their phone, they are faced 
with the knowledge that many of the 
programs and social media platforms 
that they once enjoyed are controlled 
by people who refuse to prioritize pri-
vacy and data security and realize that 
these cyber protections are important. 
They are grateful for all the sunlight 
that you and I, Mr. President, have 
been able to shine on the problems 
with Big Tech. So many times as I was 
at home, people would mention to me 
how much they have learned through 
the hearings that we have held, the 
roundtable discussions, and they are 
wanting to see more attention brought 
to keeping us safe and limiting the sur-
veillance, the property theft, and the 
academic espionage that the Chinese 
Communist Party and our adversaries 
are conducting in the virtual space. 
They are looking forward to seeing us 
translate 
this 
bipartisan 
consensus 
into action. They are looking forward 
to what we are going to deliver when it 
comes to online privacy, data security, 
section 230 reforms, to protect our 
innovators, to protect our children on-
line, to protect our consumers. 
When people look at what is being 
done, like the work we have done on 
technology policy, and what is not 
being done when it comes to addressing 
China, addressing Russia, dealing with 
Iran, when it comes to dealing with in-
flation, prices at the pump, and prices 
that are happening at the grocery 
store, they look at this and they say: 
Where is the President? Where is the 
Vice President? Where are people who 
should be working for the American 
people in Congress? 
When we talk about the Democratic 
leadership, we know that they are too 
busy catering to the most radical 
fringe of the Democratic Party to do 
their job, and they are too busy with 
that to govern or to keep the economy 
in one piece and to keep the border in-
tact or to provide for the common de-
fense or to exercise a little oversight 
over some of the world’s most powerful 
corporations. 
Well, the American people deserve 
better. Tennesseans are wanting to see 
action. So while some of our colleagues 
across the aisle have a renewed sense of 
optimism about President Biden’s abil-
ity to pull them out of this skid on this 
agenda that is going nowhere, the 
American people have spoken. They do 
not want what you are offering. 
My resolve is going to be to stand 
here, to stand between what is hap-
pening, this destructive, as I call it, 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ agenda, and to 
protect Tennesseans and future genera-
tions of Americans from such an ad-
verse and negative impact. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the Democrats’ agenda for the new 
year. 
The American people have just come 
back from the most expensive Christ-
mas 
in 
our 
Nation’s 
history, 
coronavirus cases are breaking records 
all around the country, and many 
Americans spent their Christmas with 
their travel plans canceled. 
Joe Biden now enters his second year 
in office with record-high inflation, 
record-high coronavirus cases, and a 
record-low approval rating. Now, Joe 
Biden is breaking all kinds of records, 
and each of these records reflects an 
America that is heading in the wrong 
direction. 
The American people have two major 
concerns right now: coronavirus and 
what it costs to live their daily lives. 
Yet these two issues are not even on 
the radar of Democrats in Washington, 
DC. 
In fact, Democrats have only made 
these problems worse. First, Democrats 
have unquestionably driven up the cost 
of living on American families. Infla-
tion shot up after Democrats put $2 
trillion on America’s credit card this 
spring. 
Democrats told us inflation was tran-
sitory. They said it month after month 
after month. On the day after Christ-
mas, Margaret Brennan of CBS News 
asked the Vice President a very basic 
question. She asked: Was it wrong to 
consider inflation transitory?

S16 
January 4, 2022 
It is not a gotcha question. It is a 
question American families have asked 
themselves month after month after 
month, as they heard Democrats say it 
was transitory. Well, to the American 
people the answer is very clear. It is 
obvious. Of course, it was wrong by the 
administration, by the President, by 
the Vice President to try to mislead 
the American people by claiming that 
inflation was transitory. 
So what did we hear from the Vice 
President in response to this question 
that has been of great concern to the 
American people? 
What we heard was 118 words of inco-
herent rambling. She was like a deer in 
headlights on a basic question on the 
top issue of the day. Either the Vice 
President is out of touch with the 
needs of the American people or she 
just didn’t want to admit that the 
Biden administration had been wrong 
month after month after month, until 
the inflation numbers hit a 4-year high. 
It has gone on now for 9 months and, 
you know, it is only going to get worse. 
That is what the experts are telling us. 
In October, we saw the worst inflation 
in 30 years, and, in November, it be-
came the worst inflation in 40 years. 
Prices have gone up faster than 
wages. This means the average Amer-
ican family can purchase a lot less 
today than they could when Joe Biden 
took office. 
And the biggest price increases, of 
course, have been in energy. In Novem-
ber, we saw the biggest energy price in-
crease in 10 years. CNBC reports that 
one-fifth of American families couldn’t 
afford to pay an energy bill this past 
year. Roughly the same percentage 
have kept their home at an unhealthy 
temperature because they can’t afford 
the cost of providing heat. 
People who travelled for Christmas 
faced some of the highest Christmas 
Day prices in history. Gas cost $1 more 
a gallon this Christmas than it did last 
Christmas—1 year, $1 a gallon more. 
Many people couldn’t travel because 
of 
coronavirus. 
Americans 
broke 
records for coronavirus cases twice last 
week. Ohio, Maryland, and here in the 
District of Columbia, all broke records 
for hospitalizations due to coronavirus. 
Now, remember when Joe Biden ran 
for office? He said he was the cure for 
coronavirus. This guy ought to be sued 
for medical malpractice. 
He came into office with two safe and 
effective vaccines. Millions of people 
have already been vaccinated. Yet 
more Americans have now died from 
coronavirus under President Joe Biden 
than under the previous President. 
From day one of this administration, 
this President has been inconsistent, 
incoherent, and incompetent. 
The flip-flop on masks for the vac-
cinated has continued. The administra-
tion kowtowed to the teachers union 
on mask mandates for toddlers. They 
flip-flopped on booster shots. They flip- 
flopped again on testing. 
For months now, countries like the 
United Kingdom have sent rapid tests 
to their citizens through the mail. On 
December 23, President Biden told ABC 
News: ‘‘I wish I had thought about or-
dering . . . [at-home test kits] two 
months ago.’’ 
Well, it turns out the White House 
did think about it. The media is now 
reporting that the White House turned 
down a plan to mail test kits in Octo-
ber. 
In early December, the White House 
Press Secretary was asked why the 
Biden administration wasn’t mailing 
out tests. After all, the Democrats, on 
a straight party-line vote in March, 
put $2 trillion on our Nation’s credit 
card under the guise of COVID relief. 
Only 9 percent of the money went for 
healthcare. Where did that money go? 
Billions and tens of billions of dollars, 
so-called for testing, in the bill that 
the Democrats forced on a party-line 
vote, and yet there aren’t tests in the 
country because people are lined up 
around the block waiting for tests that 
the President wished he had thought 
about. 
That is what he told the world. That 
is what he said on ABC News. 
In early December, the White House 
Press Secretary was asked why the 
Biden administration wasn’t mailing 
out tests. She mocked the idea. Then, 
just a few weeks later, it became the 
policy of this same administration— 
too little, too late, another flip-flop, 
another example of the hypocrisy and 
the incompetence of this administra-
tion. 
Someone in the press ought to ask 
Joe Biden if he still believes what he 
said as a candidate. So let’s review 
what he said as a candidate. 
In September of 2020, Joe Biden said: 
‘‘If the president had done his job from 
the beginning’’—he was referring to 
President Trump—Biden said, ‘‘all the 
people would still be alive.’’ ‘‘All the 
people,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m not making this 
up’’—Joe Biden once again telling the 
world he is not making it up. 
I don’t know of a single doctor or 
public health official anywhere in the 
world who would agree with that state-
ment by Joe Biden, then candidate for 
President. Yet Joe Biden said it repeat-
edly. 
As a candidate, Joe Biden said: ‘‘Any 
President who is responsible for that 
many deaths should not remain as 
President.’’ 
And to that I say: Joe Biden, you are 
right now responsible for that many 
deaths. So, maybe, you shouldn’t re-
main as President either. 
Joe Biden attacked the previous ad-
ministration 
for 
letting 
Governors 
manage the response to coronavirus. 
Yet just last month, Joe Biden admit-
ted: ‘‘There is no Federal solution’’ to 
the coronavirus. 
Does Joe Biden still believe what he 
said as a candidate? 
Did he ever believe it? 
What does he know? What does he 
think? What does he believe? Or was he 
just running for President on the Big 
Lie? 
Now, even for Democrats in Wash-
ington, the hypocrisy and the incom-
petence 
are 
astonishing. 
Now 
the 
American people all across this coun-
try are suffering the consequences of 
the mismanagement by this adminis-
tration. 
Flights, 
train 
departures, 
public 
events are all being canceled due to the 
resurgence of coronavirus. Cancella-
tions 
continue 
today 
because 
of 
coronavirus under the President who 
said he would solve the problem, to the 
point that even the majority party’s 
conference, which should have been a 
lunch, today was moved to be virtual 
because of the virus that Joe Biden 
said he would eliminate. 
Joe Biden’s lies and flip-flops con-
tinue. Joe Biden said he wouldn’t issue 
a vaccine mandate. He said it on sev-
eral occasions and then he broke his 
word. In the process, he took a sledge-
hammer to the American workforce, 
forcing people out of their jobs. 
The Biden administration has also 
issued a mask mandate for children as 
young as 2 years of age, in preschool. 
Just before Christmas, Senator LUM-
MIS, also from Wyoming, and I intro-
duced a bill to stop this mandate. 
There is no scientific basis for forcing 
toddlers to wear masks. This isn’t 
about the science. It has been shown 
that the teachers union lobbied for 
mask mandates in schools. 
On May 13, the Centers for Disease 
Control issued its mask guidance for 
vaccinated people—for people who had 
been fully vaccinated. The guidance 
from the Centers for Disease Control 
said that fully vaccinated people could 
stop wearing masks indoors. 
What happened the very next day? 
Well, the very next day, the head of 
the National Education Association, 
the teachers union, called the Director 
of the Centers for Disease Control. The 
day after that, the Centers for Disease 
Control released new guidance—new 
guidance—saying 
vaccinated 
people 
should wear masks in schools. Maybe it 
was a coincidence. It doesn’t look like 
it or sound like it to me. This flip-flop 
looks like a kind of political pan-
dering, the pandering to union bosses 
that this administration has engaged 
in since day one. 
The American people have two big 
concerns right now: coronavirus and 
the cost of living. Democrats on Cap-
itol Hill continue to ignore the two 
biggest concerns of the American peo-
ple. 
What are the Democrats in this body 
focused on instead? Well, for 5 months 
now, Democrats in this body have tried 
to pass the largest spending bill in his-
tory. 
What is it focused on? Not inflation; 
not COVID; not crime in the cities, 
where murder rates are at an alltime 
high; not border security, where the 
number of people coming in illegally, 
carrying disease and drugs, is at an all-
time high. No, the Democrats want to 
focus instead on climate change and 
new entitlements. Their bill included

trillions and trillions of dollars in new 
taxes and trillions and trillions of dol-
lars in new debt. 
President Biden and nearly every 
Democrat in Congress went on record 
in support of this socialist budget bill. 
Not a single Republican supports it, 
and not even every Democrat supports 
it. Now Democrats are fighting among 
themselves, and it is an absolute dis-
grace. Democrats ought to be thankful 
that bill didn’t pass, because if it 
passed, inflation would get worse, just 
in time for elections. 
This isn’t what the American people 
want. The American people have many 
concerns right now about the direction 
of this country and the direction that 
the President is trying to lead the Na-
tion. The two biggest concerns are the 
coronavirus in their communities and 
the cost of living that impacts on 
them, on the people every day. Demo-
crats are failing on both. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
CHINA 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we 
have started a new year, 2022, filled 
with opportunities and possibilities. 
Yet, even as we contemplate new be-
ginnings, many things remain the 
same, especially when it comes to the 
crimes and atrocities being carried out 
by the Chinese Communist Party. 
The genocide against the Uighur 
Muslims is still ongoing—a million in-
dividuals enslaved. The attacks on de-
mocracy and the silencing of free 
speech in Hong Kong continue. In fact, 
it was just announced that one of Hong 
Kong’s last remaining pro-democracy 
news outlets, Citizen News, is shutting 
its doors because it cannot continue 
operations under the current climate of 
repression under China’s national secu-
rity law. In spite of all that, just 31 
days from today, leaders and athletes 
from across the world will gather in 
Beijing to celebrate the opening cere-
monies of the 2022 Winter Olympic 
Games. 
The Olympic Games are meant to in-
spire and to bring people together to 
build a better world, using sports to 
foster what the Olympic movement de-
scribes as a peaceful society, concerned 
with the preservation of human dig-
nity, but China is not using these 
games to advance human dignity; it is 
using the games to polish its inter-
national image and hide its crimes and 
abuses. A peaceful society, concerned 
with the preservation of human dig-
nity, would not idly stand by and allow 
its government to silence those who 
speak out for the rights of their fellow 
workers. Yet we see that happening 
time and time again in China. 
This picture is of Fang Ran. He is a 
26-year-old Ph.D. student in Hong Kong 
University’s 
Sociology 
Department, 
where he studies Chinese labor rela-
tions and the Chinese labor movement. 
It is reported that Fang, while con-
ducting fieldwork on his thesis about 
labor empowerment in China, in his 
hometown on the mainland last Au-
gust, was taken into custody by the 
Chinese authorities under the phrase 
‘‘residential surveillance at a des-
ignated location.’’ 
What is ‘‘residential surveillance at a 
designated location’’? 
It is a coercive measure that allows 
authorities to hold individuals for up 
to 6 months, with no access to lawyers 
and no access to family at all. 
Apparently, his research, as well as 
frequent social media posts about 
workers’ rights, sexual harassment, 
and the displacement of migrant work-
ers, put him on Beijing’s radar. 
According to one article, this young 
man roamed the factory towns of 
southern China, immersing himself in 
workers’ lives and supporting them 
while they tried to strike or seek com-
pensation for work injuries. 
Even the fact that he is a loyal mem-
ber of the Communist Party did not 
save him from officials’ ire. One of his 
friends said that, in the months leading 
up to his disappearance, Fang had re-
peatedly been asked to drink tea. 
‘‘Drink tea’’ is a code word for being 
summoned for questioning and harass-
ment by Chinese security services. It 
has now been 4 months since the last 
time he was invited to ‘‘drink tea,’’ and 
he has not been seen again. He has been 
detained because of his advocacy for 
workers in China—workers, in fact, 
like 31-year-old Chen Guojiang, a gig 
delivery worker. Gig delivery workers 
were essential during the pandemic to 
deliver food, groceries, and other need-
ed items. 
While delivering scores of takeout or-
ders a day, Chen would film short vid-
eos that showed the dangerous working 
conditions of the delivery workers, and 
he used those videos to advocate not 
just for better pay but for action 
against powerful Chinese e-commerce 
companies that benefit from fostering 
dangerous work conditions. Whether he 
intended it or not, this man, driving 
along on his electric scooter, wearing 
his bright, windproof jacket, became a 
rarity in China—a labor leader and or-
ganizer. 
Then, suddenly, last February—al-
most a year ago—he disappeared. Over 
the course of the COVID pandemic, a 
movement for labor rights had begun 
to grow and gained mainstream trac-
tion, and delivery workers like Chen, 
who were lifelines for untold millions, 
could be seen outside every apartment 
building and every office building. 
There were symbols of this growing 
movement. 
So, in the eyes of the Chinese Gov-
ernment, individuals like Chen had to 
be stopped—stopped from advocating, 
in even the smallest way, for any sort 
of collective effort to improve the con-
dition of Chinese workers. So, almost a 
year ago, he was detained and given 
the catchall charge of ‘‘picking quar-
rels and provoking trouble.’’ So many 
dissidents in China have been detained 
over the last few years for picking 
quarrels and provoking trouble because 
Chen believed, as he said in one of his 
videos, that ‘‘delivery workers are hu-
mans, too, not robots, though the sys-
tem wants to make us like cogs in a 
machine.’’ His case is being handled 
with great secrecy by authorities. 
About a month into his detention, 
friends and supporters began collecting 
donations to cover his legal fees. They 
raised about $20,000, but then the Chi-
nese officials contacted every person 
who donated, warning them not to help 
Chen. When the officials visited his 
parents to deliver a notice of his deten-
tion, they demanded his father sign the 
notice even though it was impossible 
for his father to read what was on the 
notice because of several lines being 
smudged out. So the father had no idea 
what he was actually acknowledging 
on that paperwork. Chen, for advo-
cating for improvements in worker 
conditions, is facing up to 5 years in a 
Chinese prison. 
His status and his future are unclear, 
but I call on the Chinese Government: 
Release those you have detained, like 
this young man who was working to 
make conditions better for workers in 
China. 
Well, here we are, just 31 days from 
the start of the Winter Olympics in 
China—Olympics 
that 
the 
Inter-
national Olympic Committee says are 
about a peaceful society concerned 
with the preservation of human dig-
nity. 
I say to the Chinese Government: 
Wouldn’t it be the right thing to do for 
human dignity to release individuals 
who have simply spoken up like these 
two young men did for their fellow 
workers? 
I say to the International Olympic 
Committee: Wouldn’t it be the right 
thing for you to call on the Chinese 
Government to release individuals like 
these two young men who have simply 
spoken up to improve the condition of 
their fellow workers? Wouldn’t that be 
consistent with human dignity? 
I will tell you what is not consistent 
with human dignity, and that is Chi-
nese genocide against the Uighur com-
munity, enslaving near a million peo-
ple. What is not consistent with human 
dignity is striking down the free press 
in Hong Kong. The slogan of the Wash-
ington Post is, ‘‘Democracy Dies in 
Darkness,’’ and that is the goal of the 
Chinese Government—to drive a stake 
through the democratic rights of Hong 
Kong citizens. 
As we approach these games, let us 
not allow the Chinese Government and 
the Communist Party to hide their re-
pression behind the glitz and glamour 
of Olympic Gold. Let’s, instead, dedi-
cate ourselves to calling out, time and 
time again, the oppression the Chinese 
Government is engaged in and demand 
justice that delivers human dignity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S18 
January 4, 2022 
Often, people think in terms of the 
Court, the Supreme Court, primarily, 
being a check on the Congress of the 
United States not doing constitutional 
things or things in a constitutional 
way or maybe checking a President not 
doing things that he is constitutionally 
empowered to do. 
We don’t often think of Congress 
being a check on the judicial branch of 
government, but from time to time we 
pass legislation that says: To you folks 
on the Supreme Court making a deci-
sion, you didn’t make that decision ac-
cording to what congressional intent 
was. So we find ourselves passing legis-
lation to overturn some Court case 
that misinterpreted a statute. At least 
that is our view that they misinter-
preted a statute or congressional in-
tent. 
The last time I remember doing this 
was maybe a couple, 3 years ago on a 
tax bill. It happened that I had at least 
one person interpreting our statute 
correctly on this tax provision. It was 
Justice Breyer. I got a little note from 
Justice Breyer, pointing to his dissent 
in that case, and it said: It is an oppor-
tunity for you to pass a statute cor-
recting what, I think, was a misinter-
pretation by the majority of that tax 
provision. 
And we got that passed. 
So here I am again. I don’t know how 
many times in the last 30 years I have 
had to correct Court decisions mis-
interpreting the False Claims Act. We 
are in the process of trying to do that 
on the subject of whether or not cer-
tain actions of our government are ma-
terial to that case actually being able 
to be prosecuted. I am talking about 
the False Claims Act that I and a lib-
eral Member of the House of Represent-
atives got passed in 1986. 
The False Claims Act is the govern-
ment’s most powerful tool in fighting 
and deterring fraud. And I say to my 
fellow colleagues that any law that has 
brought in about $65 billion of fraudu-
lently taken money, that ought to, in 
itself, prove the worth of this legisla-
tion. 
On the other hand, the courts inter-
pret it and maybe weaken it, so I am 
back here to make an argument for 
strengthening it but not strengthening 
it beyond the original intent of the 
Congress of the United States in 1986. I 
have devoted much of my time in the 
Senate to strengthening this law on be-
half of the taxpayers. 
Last November, the Judiciary Com-
mittee voted on a bill that I sponsored 
that was very much a bipartisan co-
sponsorship to further strengthen the 
False Claims Act by clarifying what 
violations are ‘‘material.’’ Some of my 
colleagues expressed concern with my 
amendment, even in light of the fact 
that this legislation has brought $65 
billion of fraudulently taken money 
back into the Federal Treasury. Most 
of those concerns by my colleagues 
were based on debunked, recycled talk-
ing points from lobbyists that sound a 
lot like the ones that I have been hear-
ing since 1986—the purpose of the legis-
lation. Most of the time, they have 
come from businesses that profit the 
most from defrauding the government. 
When I authored the False Claims 
Act amendments in 1986, I did it be-
cause fraud against the Federal Gov-
ernment was out of control, especially 
in the defense sector. At the time, the 
Justice Department estimated that we 
were losing somewhere between 1 per-
cent to 10 percent of the Federal budg-
et to fraud. Most importantly, I saw 
that fraud put lives at risk, including 
those of our military, those of our law 
enforcement, and even of our veterans. 
So I am going to speak about some of 
this fraud that put lives at risk. 
Recent 
court 
misinterpretations— 
and these are the misinterpretations 
that I have talked about already. Re-
cent court misinterpretations have, 
once again, like several times in the 
last 25 years, hurt the government’s 
ability to hold these fraudsters ac-
countable by the courts that have 
made those decisions not following 
properly legislative intent. 
Some courts now say that if the gov-
ernment keeps paying a claim despite 
some knowledge of potential fraud, 
then the violation is not material. 
Now, that is not common sense. If the 
government 
knows 
of 
fraud—now, 
think of this: If the government actu-
ally knows of fraud but keeps paying 
for that fraud, then that fraud can’t be 
prosecuted under the False Claims Act. 
That doesn’t make sense to hard 
workers on Main Street in the Mid-
west. It doesn’t meet the commonsense 
test for the government to protect 
fraudsters. This is wrong, and I want to 
show you some instances of where it is 
dangerous. 
Today, I want to bring examples to 
you about real cases with real life ex-
periences, cases where, had this flawed 
interpretation 
applied, 
the 
results 
would have been absurd and tragic. 
First, in 2009, a major defense con-
tractor settled a False Claims Act case 
with the Federal Government for $325 
million after allegations arose that 
they provided faulty parts for spy sat-
ellites. Due to the faulty parts, several 
satellites started to malfunction. One 
of them was on an important mission 
over the Middle East during a time of 
war. 
Evidence showed that the contractor 
knew about the malfunctions but hid— 
hid—these modifications from the gov-
ernment. But even if the government 
had some idea about fraud, it couldn’t 
stop payment because the contractor 
was the only company that could man-
ufacture and support these satellites. 
Had this case been brought today, a 
court could incorrectly find that the 
violation was not material. 
This ought to be unacceptable, and it 
is. This kind of fraud can hurt our 
troops and damage our national secu-
rity. 
Second example: Fraud hurts our law 
enforcement officers here at home. In 
2018, the Justice Department settled a 
fraud claim brought by a whistleblower 
against a manufacturer of bulletproof 
vests. According to public records, the 
manufacturer knew the vests would ac-
tually degrade and degrade very quick-
ly under normal heat and humidity. 
The manufacturer tried to cover its 
tracks by publishing misleading data. 
Those actions delayed the govern-
ment’s efforts to determine the true 
extent of the damage to these bullet-
proof vests. After years of investiga-
tion, a National Institute of Justice 
study found that more than 50 percent 
of the used vests could not stop a bul-
let—a very life-threatening issue. 
In this case, the manufacturer argued 
that since the government kept paying 
for the vests, the fact that they didn’t 
work was immaterial. Thankfully, the 
judge had common sense enough to see 
past such ridiculous arguments. In 
other words, common sense prevailed 
in that particular courtroom. 
Now, remember, the actions of these 
fraudsters put our law enforcement 
personnel’s lives at risk. Now, we had a 
brave whistleblower. So thanks to that 
brave whistleblower who uncovered 
this fraud, the money recovered from 
the settlement was used to purchase 
new bulletproof vests. 
Third example and last example: 
Fraud hurts our veterans and under-
mines the Federal programs Congress 
created to support them and their fam-
ilies. 
Another case involved fraud in home 
loans insured by the VA. The goal of 
these loans is to keep veterans in their 
homes. So, as most veterans know, VA 
loans prohibit lenders from charging 
veterans hidden fees. In this instance, a 
mortgage lender was illegally charging 
our veterans fees for VA-insured loans. 
But the government never ceased 
payment because doing so would hurt 
the program and the veterans it was 
meant to help—not to mention that 
once a loan guarantee is approved, the 
VA is prohibited by law from declining 
payments. 
Despite this, the district court ap-
plied the bogus new interpretation of 
materiality. The court dismissed the 
case. In other words, the fraudsters got 
away with it, and the court dismissed, 
saying that the government’s contin-
ued payment meant the fraud was not 
material. So the government is allow-
ing a program to go on, pay money out, 
even if they know there is fraud. 
So let me underscore the obvious. I 
am telling you, Congress didn’t intend 
for courts to find that fleecing veterans 
for profit is immaterial. The legisla-
tion that has come out of the Judiciary 
Committee will fix this nonsense. And 
I 
hope 
some 
Republicans—because 
most of the opposition in the Judiciary 
Committee came from Republicans. 
Democrats understand that this bill 
must pass, but, for some reason, Re-
publicans are willing to accept this 
nonsense about immateriality. 
So that is the purpose of this legisla-
tion. It clarifies that the government’s

decision to continue paying a claim de-
spite knowledge of fraud is not disposi-
tive if other reasons exist for the con-
tinued payment—these simple reasons 
like everybody expected our govern-
ment ought to do: to continue pro-
tecting our troops, to continue helping 
our law enforcement officers be safe in 
their job, and to make sure that a vet-
eran doesn’t get taken as a sucker to 
give away a lot of money that would be 
illegally taken. 
So, as shown by the examples I just 
gave you, examples I highlighted this 
very day, the government’s decision to 
continue paying a claim by itself 
doesn’t prove materiality. 
You may ask: Why did the govern-
ment continue the payments? Well, 
that is pretty much simple common 
sense too—because you want these pro-
grams to function the way they should 
function. 
My amendment will guarantee that 
the government can hold fraudsters ac-
countable even when the government 
has to continue payment for a product 
or a service. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The Senator from Kansas. 
REMEMBERING JOHNNY ISAKSON 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today is 
an opportunity for me to remind our 
colleagues of the value of Senator 
Johnny Isakson. I particularly want to 
speak this afternoon about his work in 
regard to our Nation’s veterans. 
When Senator Isakson retired, re-
signed from the U.S. Senate, I replaced 
him as the chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, but I 
served the entire time he was the 
chairman. In fact, I have served the en-
tire time I have been in the Senate and 
the entire time I have been in the 
House. And Senator Isakson and Con-
gressman Isakson and I served together 
in both bodies. 
I want to highlight for my colleagues 
and for Americans—and particularly 
the veterans across the country—that 
they had an advocate in Senator John-
ny Isakson for them, for our Nation’s 
veterans. He knew—he knew—the debt 
we owe to our veterans and kept that 
at the forefront of his mind and his 
heart as he led the Senate Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
His service as chairman was moti-
vated by the stories of veterans who 
had touched his own life. Senator Isak-
son regularly spoke about two vet-
erans—two veterans who shaped his ap-
proach as chairman: his college friend 
Jackson Elliott Cox III and Georgia na-
tive Noah Harris. 
Jackson Cox volunteered to serve in 
the Marines in Vietnam and was killed 
by a sniper a month before he was 
scheduled to return home. Noah Harris 
had volunteered to serve in the Army 
after 9/11 and was killed while serving 
in Iraq. Both men volunteered to serve 
their country in the military during 
times of war, and both men gave their 
lives in that service. 
Senator Isakson was compelled by 
their service to remember and speak 
about the men and women who gave 
their lives to defend our Nation and be-
lieved that we must also remember and 
honor those who made it home. 
Senator Isakson was involved in a 
number of legislative successes that 
improved how our Nation serves its 
veterans after they leave the military, 
and I want to highlight four of those 
pieces of legislation. 
First, the Veterans Affairs Account-
ability and Whistleblower Protection 
Act finally gave the VA the tools it 
needed to hold officials accountable 
following several scandals at the De-
partment and set the expectation that 
the VA would maintain a high-perform-
ance workforce to serve our veterans. 
Second, the Veterans Appeals Im-
provement and Modernization Act of 
2017 modernized the archaic benefits 
claims process at the VA and allowed 
VA to reduce its appeal backlog from 
nearly half a million appeals down to 
around 100,000. Veterans now have 
choices as to how they appeal benefits 
decisions and can receive timely deci-
sions rather than waiting and waiting 
and waiting. 
Third, the Harry W. Colmery Vet-
erans Education Assistance Act of 2017, 
which is known as the Forever GI Bill, 
revolutionized veterans’ education ben-
efits by eliminating the 15-year window 
after service during which a veteran 
could use those benefits. It also in-
vested in STEM education, IT and 
technology certification programs, and 
benefits for surviving families of vet-
erans. 
Finally, the VA MISSION Act is leg-
islation I am proud to have cham-
pioned alongside Senator Isakson. He 
knew that temporary programs put in 
place to address the Phoenix wait time 
scandal needed to be consolidated with 
existing options for care outside the 
VA, and I was honored to help him and 
the rest of Congress see the MISSION 
Act signed into law to give veterans 
clear choices on getting the care that 
best serves their needs. 
Senator Isakson also felt a strong 
connection to veterans of the ‘‘greatest 
generation’’ who saved the world in 
World War II. On a visit in Europe, 
Senator Isakson came across the grave 
of Roy C. Irwin, who was killed in the 
Battle of the Bulge on the very same 
day that Senator Isakson was born in 
Georgia. He spoke regularly about the 
perspective that visit gave him and 
how he thought about what Roy Irwin 
and so many others who served had 
done for him and for all of us. 
In his last year as chairman, Senator 
Isakson led a Senate delegation to 
commemorate the 75th anniversary of 
D-day in Normandy, France. Despite 
the challenges his health may have 
posed for such a trip, he knew the im-
portance of showing our World War II 
veterans and, in fact, the entire world 
that we remember their sacrifices and 
that as a nation, we honor the service 
of that generation and the example 
they set for generations to come. 
Senator Isakson did not just remem-
ber the sacrifices of our veterans; he 
acted whenever he could to see to it 
that the benefits and services their 
country offered were delivered in the 
manner they deserved. 
Before Army 1LT Noah Harris was 
killed in 2005, he and Senator Isakson 
exchanged letters, and Senator Isakson 
noted how Noah would always sign his 
letters ‘‘IDWIC,’’ which stood for ‘‘I do 
what I can.’’ 
Similarly, Senator Isakson sought to 
get to yes on solutions instead of just 
focusing on problems or Senate dif-
ferences or people’s differences. He al-
ways worked to do everything he could 
when someone needed help, and his 
service to veterans will shine as an ex-
ample for others—for us—to emulate. 
We will remember Senator Isakson and 
the impact he had on our Nation’s vet-
erans, and that will be remembered for 
generations. 
Senator Isakson served 6 years in the 
House and 14 years in the Senate. He 
died December 19 at age 76. Over two 
decades of service and certainly over 
two decades of service to America’s 
veterans. 
I want to extend my condolences to 
Senator Isakson’s wife Dianne and his 
children, Julie, Kevin, and John. 
Please know that we are thinking of 
you all and are praying for you during 
this challenging and difficult time. 
May God bless that family, and may 
Johnny Isakson rest in peace. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING HARRY REID 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a 
week ago, the Senate lost a distin-
guished former colleague and the State 
of Nevada lost an unparalleled advo-
cate. 
Senator Harry Reid’s path to this 
Chamber was a quintessentially Amer-
ican story. His incredible path from 
childhood poverty, to the boxing ring, 
to leading the U.S. Senate took both 
toughness and tenacity. And in this 
Chamber, just like everywhere else, 
Harry left it all in the ring. 
As leaders of our respective parties, 
the two of us disagreed energetically 
and often. We had sharply different 
views, goals, and philosophies on every-
thing from public policy to the institu-
tion of the Senate itself. But through

all the heat and light, I never doubted 
that Harry was doing what he ear-
nestly believed was right for Nevada 
and for the Nation. 
Elaine and I were grateful to enjoy a 
joint 
friendship 
with 
Harry 
and 
Landra, the light of Harry’s life, his be-
loved high school sweetheart. The Sen-
ate’s thoughts and prayers continue to 
be with her and the entire Reid family. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on a completely dif-
ferent matter, as the Senate begins 
this new year and new session, millions 
of Americans are yet again having life 
disrupted by a new and surging variant 
of the coronavirus. Thus far, there is 
cause 
for 
optimism. 
The 
rapidly 
spreading Omicron variant seems to 
cause milder disease than previous 
iterations. By now, a huge portion of 
our population has some immunity 
through our remarkable safe and effec-
tive vaccines or through prior expo-
sure, and our healthcare providers 
know much more today than they did 2 
years ago. 
Unfortunately, the last few weeks 
have also exposed big gaps between the 
Biden administration’s promises and 
the reality under their leadership. In 
2020, then-Candidate Biden promised he 
would ‘‘shut down the virus.’’ That 
clearly has not happened. Back when 
the virus had killed 220,000 Americans, 
then-Candidate Biden said that ‘‘any-
one who is responsible for that many 
deaths should not remain as President 
of the United States.’’ Now almost four 
times that many people have died. 
Look, nobody is solely blaming this 
administration for this mutating virus, 
but nobody forced Democrats to cam-
paign on those promises and attacks. 
They chose to do that, but they haven’t 
governed accordingly. 
It has been nearly a year since Presi-
dent Biden inherited three vaccines 
and a distribution operation that was 
already putting a million shots in a 
million arms every day. That was be-
fore this administration took office. 
What new solutions do Democrats have 
to show for a full year in power? Where 
is their 2021 equivalent to our 2020’s Op-
eration Warp Speed? What did they 
produce in 11 months besides angry 
speeches about the vaccines they inher-
ited? Why does the pandemic in Janu-
ary 2022 feel so eerily similar to the 
pandemic in January of 2021, except 
that this administration happened to 
get lucky with an apparently less-dan-
gerous variant? 
After a year of this administration, 
families are still having trouble track-
ing down testing for work, school, trav-
el, or even peace of mind. This admin-
istration has limited important treat-
ments. They dragged their heels on 
promising innovations. They have been 
inexplicably slow to disburse relief 
funds for hospitals and providers that 
Congress set aside ages ago. They have 
used odd, alienating rhetoric around 
the vaccines they inherited. 
And remember, last spring when our 
Democratic colleagues spent $1.9 tril-
lion on a supposedly COVID-related 
spending bill, only 9 percent of it went 
to the actual fight against COVID–19— 
just 9 percent of the $1.9 trillion au-
thorized last March. 
So this all-Democrat government 
spent its first year distracted, and the 
country is feeling the consequences. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, on a related matter, 
fortunately for the country, before 
Christmas, one of those far-left distrac-
tions was dealt a setback. The Demo-
crats’ wasteful spending last spring 
helped ignite the worst inflation in 40 
years, but our colleagues spent the rest 
of 2021 trying to assemble yet another 
even bigger, even more reckless tax- 
and-spending spree. Their reaction to 
rising prices and family hardships their 
policies caused was to try to inflate 
their way out of inflation. 
The experts say that when you strip 
away the budget gimmick, their pro-
posal would cost almost $5 trillion. And 
all of that reckless borrowing and 
money-printing was for far-left policies 
that would hurt American families and 
actually help China. 
The supposedly ‘‘green’’ subsidies 
would just dump money in China-domi-
nated supply chains. America takes on 
massive debt to ‘‘Build Back Beijing.’’ 
The childcare plan was actually an 
unworkable and discriminatory toddler 
takeover that would drive up daycare 
costs and let woke bureaucrats drive 
out faith-based providers. They even 
wanted to distort American parents’ 
child tax credit and turn it into an old- 
school cash welfare program with no 
work requirements at all—now, all of 
this paired with historic, crushing tax 
hikes and trillions more dollars to 
make inflation even worse. 
It was a merrier Christmas for Amer-
ican families because this awful bill 
was actually put aside. Working Amer-
icans need it to actually stay on the 
shelf. 
VOTING 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
when our colleagues’ reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree began to falter, 
some Democrats started saying a to-
tally different issue was actually really 
their top priority. If they don’t get to 
blow $5 trillion on low-quality social-
ism, our colleagues are now demanding 
a consolation prize: breaking the Sen-
ate’s rules in order to give themselves 
sweeping control over all 50 States’ 
election laws. 
This is what some of our colleagues 
want so desperately. This is what they 
have sought for years. Even as their 
pretexts and justifications kept shift-
ing, the goal stayed consistent. Most 
Washington Democrats want to ap-
point themselves a nationwide board of 
elections on steroids, and they want to 
shatter the Senate’s rules and tradi-
tions to make it happen. 
After 
Democrats 
lost 
the 
White 
House in 2016, they said this takeover 
was necessary because our democracy 
was fundamentally broken. Now that 
they have won the White House, the 
story has totally flipped. Now our de-
mocracy is in perfect shape, beyond re-
proach—except 
when 
States 
that 
Democrats don’t control dare to pass 
mainstream voting laws. 
The political left keeps pitching 
their big lie that mainstream State 
voting laws are somehow ‘‘Jim Crow 
2.0’’ if the Governor who signs the bill 
happens to be a Republican. The left’s 
big lie insults the intelligence of the 
American people. All the facts disprove 
it. In one of the States that triggered 
this meltdown, the new profiles man-
dated more days—more days—of early 
voting than many Democrat-run States 
provide today. 
Our democracy is not in crisis. Re-
peating this rhetoric doesn’t make it 
factual. The 2020 elections saw the 
highest turnout in more than 100 years. 
Only 33 percent of American adults 
think it is too hard for eligible voters 
to vote. A larger share actually think 
current rules aren’t strict enough. This 
is fake—fake—hysteria ginned up by 
partisans, and our citizens actually 
know it. They figured it out. Last No-
vember, even in New York, the State’s 
overwhelmingly Democratic voters re-
jected several left-wing ballot meas-
ures to change voting laws. 
This big lie that democracy is dying 
because 
Democrats 
sometimes 
lose 
elections is a completely astro-turfed 
sense of crisis. The emperor has no 
clothes. 
It is even more ironic that on this 
most sensitive subject—our democracy 
itself—some Senate Democrats want to 
drop a procedural nuclear bomb on the 
Senate itself to get their way. Our col-
leagues have no principled opposition 
to the filibuster—none at all. This is 
not about principle. 
In 2020 alone, Senate Democrats used 
the filibuster repeatedly to block the 
CARES Act, delaying help at the start 
of the pandemic. They used it to kill 
Senator TIM SCOTT’s police reform bill. 
In 2017, 32 Senate Democrats, includ-
ing then-Senator HARRIS, signed an 
open letter insisting the legislative fil-
ibuster should not change. A few years 
before that, the current Democratic 
leader said this about the prospect of 
nuking the filibuster. This is from the 
current Democratic leader: 
The ideologues in the Senate want to turn 
what the Founding Fathers called the ‘‘cool-
ing 
saucer 
of 
democracy’’ 
into 
the 
rubberstamp of dictatorship. 
He went on: 
They believe if you get 51 percent of the 
vote, there should be one party rule. 
He went on: 
They want to make this country into a ba-
nana republic where if you don’t get your 
way, you change the rules. 
He went on: 
It will be a doomsday for democracy if we 
do. 
That is the Senate Democratic leader 
on the possibility of nuking the Sen-
ate. Some people’s tunes change when 
they happen to be in the majority 
versus the minority, but some Senators

REMEMBERING DR. JERALD F. 
COMBS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
eastern Kentucky, one man has been at 
the center of efforts to expand eye care 
for nearly 40 years. Dr. Jerald Combs, 
who passed away last month, played an 
instrumental role in modernizing and 
extending access to optometric care 
across Kentucky’s Appalachian region. 
Today, I recognize Dr. Combs as an 
outstanding Kentuckian whose work 
made a vast impact on the lives of his 
patients. 
When Dr. Combs began his practice 
in Martin, KY, in 1983, optometry in 
eastern 
Kentucky 
was 
an 
under-
developed 
practice. 
Many 
residents 
lacked access to the eye care they 
needed, leaving far too many without 
good vision. Dr. Combs made it his mis-
sion to change that status quo and im-
proved many lives in the process. His 
clinic served the entire eastern Ken-
tucky region, attracting patients from 
far and wide who needed his care. 
Perhaps Dr. Combs’ greatest legacy 
will be his efforts to increase optom-
etry training opportunities in his com-
munity. Because of his work in this 
area, the University of Pikeville named 
their college of optometry in his honor. 
The school’s Jerald F. Combs Endowed 
Scholarship gives students of all back-
grounds the ability to study the sub-
ject, providing expertise to those who 
will stay in eastern Kentucky and help 
develop the field further. 
Throughout his life, Dr. Combs was 
committed to serving his community 
and our Commonwealth and earned 
many awards for his efforts. The Ken-
tucky Optometric Association lavished 
him with praise, granting him both 
their Optometrist of the Year Award 
and 
Distinguished 
Service 
Award 
twice. He also served as president and a 
board member of the association for 
many years. Outside of optometry, Dr. 
Combs helped his community through 
the Knott County Youth Foundation, 
the Knott County Little League, the 
Kiwanis Club, and the Hazard Lions 
Club. He served on the University of 
Pikeville Board of Trustees, steering 
the school to success. 
I knew Dr. Combs personally and was 
saddened to learn of his passing last 
month. Few Kentuckians play as big or 
instrumental of a role in their commu-
nity as he did. While we all mourn his 
loss, we can also be confident that his 
legacy, expanded access to eye care 
among Kentucky’s most vulnerable 
communities, will last for many years 
into the future. I would like to express 
my personal gratitude for Dr. Combs’ 
decades of service to the Common-
wealth and encourage my Senate col-
leagues to join me in sharing condo-
lences with the family, friends, and 
colleagues.

RECOGNIZING 
OWENSBORO, 
THE 
‘‘BLUEGRASS CAPITAL OF THE 
WORLD’’ 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, few 
Kentucky creations have had as much 
impact on American culture as Blue-
grass music. It is the spring from 
which all other country music flows 
and one of our State’s most world-re-
nowned exports. Owensboro, KY, has 
played an important role in maintain-
ing and promoting Bluegrass history, 
style, and heritage and, in recognition 
of that work, was recently named the 
Bluegrass Capital of the World. Today, 
I honor Owensboro for earning this 
title and helping preserve Kentucky’s 
proud Bluegrass culture. 
Owensboro’s deep connection to Blue-
grass music dates back to the genre’s 
earliest days. Bill Monroe, widely rec-
ognized as the ‘‘Father of Bluegrass’’, 
was born just outside Owensboro in 
Ohio County, KY. His musical group, 
the Blue Grass Boys, adapted the 
unique style of music they found in 
Scotch-Irish 
communities 
in 
Ken-
tucky’s Appalachian foothills and pop-
ularized it for a mainstream audience. 
Listeners, entranced by Blue Grass 
Boys’ soaring melodies, jaunty rhythm, 
and homespun style, started a craze for 
Bluegrass music that brought national 
fame to generations of Kentucky art-
ists. 
Owensboro’s leaders have recognized 
their unique role in Bluegrass history 
and sought to capitalize on that con-
nection. City officials ushered in the 
Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Mu-
seum in downtown Owensboro in 1991, 
inviting both tourists and locals to 
learn about and enjoy Bluegrass his-
tory. The city’s annual ‘‘River of Music 
Party’’, or ROMP, welcomes more than 
20,000 visitors to the banks of the Ohio 
River to celebrate Bluegrass artists 
and help sustain this proud Kentucky 
tradition. 
And 
just 
recently, 
Owensboro Mayor Tom Watson signed 
the official proclamation naming his 
city the Bluegrass Capital of the 
World, cementing Owensboro’s impor-
tant place in Bluegrass history. 
Owensboro’s leaders have also initi-
ated a strong campaign to educate and 
popularize Bluegrass among the next 
generation of Kentuckians. The Blue-
grass Music Hall of Fame and Museum 
features rotating exhibits highlighting 
key parts of Bluegrass history and 
hosts artists that promote the genre. 
The museum offers lessons in musical 
instruments like the mandolin, banjo, 
and fiddle, helping ensure the survival 
of their unique sounds and style. The 
museum’s Bluegrass in the Schools 
program 
has 
introduced 
Bluegrass 
music to nearly 10,000 elementary stu-
dents, including in 24 Owensboro-area 
schools, connecting young Kentuckians 
with their State’s culture and history. 
Bluegrass music is the soundtrack of 
Kentucky. From the first pluck of the 
banjo, strum of the guitar, or drone of 
the fiddle, the genre is immediately 
recognizable. Owensboro’s leaders have 
done incredible, extensive work to pre-
serve and promote this unique Ken-
tucky music and are incredibly deserv-
ing of their city’s recent designation as 
Bluegrass Capital of the World. 
Mr. President, the Owensboro Mes-
senger-Inquirer highlighted the city’s 
new title in a recent article. I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
the 
article 
be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, 
Nov. 24, 2021] 
BLUEGRASS CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 
The City of Owensboro has officially been 
designated the ‘‘Bluegrass Capital of the 
World’’ after more than a year of effort by 
the city and the Bluegrass Hall of Fame and 
Museum. 
Mayor Tom Watson officially signed the 
proclamation 
permanently 
linking 
Owensboro and bluegrass music during a 
Nov. 12 ceremony at the Bluegrass Hall of 
Fame and Museum. 
‘‘About 15 months ago we started talking 
about this idea, and it has taken a little 
while to get it to this point, but we are here 
today to declare the City of Owensboro as 
the Bluegrass Music Capital of the World,’’ 
Watson said during the event. 
Watson called Chris Joslin, museum execu-
tive director, to the stage and asked him to 
turn around so he could officially sign the 
proclamation on his back, telling him, ‘‘a lot 
of this is going to be on your back.’’ 
‘‘The idea is to create a sustainable struc-
ture and utilize our bluegrass music presence 
to build out economic development opportu-
nities and increase tourism,’’ Watson said.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S22 
January 4, 2022 
‘‘In short, attract new businesses that manu-
facture or provide services that are con-
sumed outside our community connected to 
bluegrass 
music 
and 
attract 
people 
to 
Owensboro, 
the 
epicenter 
of 
bluegrass 
music.’’ 
Joslin said Owensboro began celebrating 
its bluegrass heritage during the early 1980s, 
when a concert series was formed pairing 
bluegrass artists with the Owensboro Sym-
phony Orchestra. 
‘‘I think it demonstrated that bluegrass 
music could be a differentiator for this com-
munity, creating something unique, creating 
something that no other community has,’’ 
he said. 
Joslin said the opening of the Bluegrass 
Hall of Fame and Museum at 311 West 2nd 
St. in Owensboro in 2018 signaled to the 
world that the organization means business 
and is part of an economic strategy that be-
gins with cultural tourism, and can grow as 
more and more people and industry related 
to the music industry comes to the city. 
‘‘I have said before that I believe that most 
communities like ours, they want to be 
known for something,’’ Joslin said. ‘‘Some-
thing that matters, something that is au-
thentic and compelling, something that has 
a positive, tangible impact on their commu-
nity. I can tell you that if the news of that 
something extends beyond the city limits 
and the county line, well there is oppor-
tunity there, and opportunity attracts peo-
ple, it attracts investment.’’ 
‘‘Friends, I can tell you that this is our 
time, this is our opportunity, and we are 
claiming it today as the Bluegrass Music 
Capital of the World.’’ 
Mike Simpson, chairman of the Inter-
national Bluegrass Music Association, pro-
vided a brief history of the bluegrass musical 
genre. 
‘‘The odyssey of this original American art 
form started right down the road here in 
Ohio County, and much of its history can be 
traced right here to Owensboro, Kentucky,’’ 
Simpson said. 
Simpson cited early bluegrass musicians 
Arnold Schultz, Pendleton Vandiver and his 
grandfather, Cleveland Baize, as forging a 
music combining Irish, Scottish and blues 
music. 
‘‘Pendleton Vandiver had a nephew by the 
name of William Smith Monroe that listened 
to that music, and he and his brothers, Char-
lie and Birch, they left Ohio County and they 
took it to the world,’’ Simpson said. ‘‘In 1936 
they signed a record deal with RCA Victor, 
and soon the bluegrass music was being 
spread across radio airwaves across this 
country.’’ 
Simpson said in 1945, bluegrass came to the 
Grand Ole Opry at Nashville’s famed Ryman 
Auditorium when Chubby Wise, Howard 
Watts, Lester Flat and Earl Scruggs stepped 
onto the stage. 
‘‘That was bluegrass’ sonic boom,’’ Simp-
son said. 
Today, bluegrass is a celebrated part of 
Owensboro’s culture. With the only dedi-
cated Bluegrass Hall of Fame and Museum, 
the annual ROMP Festival attracting 25,000 
annually to enjoy bluegrass and roots music, 
as well as bluegrass-themed media being cre-
ated in Owensboro, it has become ingrained 
in the city’s culture. 
Simpson said Owensboro being officially 
known and celebrated as the ‘‘Bluegrass Cap-
ital of the World’’ was ‘‘a long time coming.’’

REMEMBERING ANDREW 
FRANKLIN ALEXANDER 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and Senator BLACKBURN, 
I ask unanimous consent that the fol-
lowing remarks be printed in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD to further honor 
the life of Andrew Franklin Alexander, 
the late son of former Tennessee U.S. 
Senator Lamar Alexander. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
HONORING ANDREW FRANKLIN ALEXANDER 
Andrew Franklin Alexander, age 52, passed 
away December 31, 2021 after a short illness. 
Drew was born in Washington, D.C., on Sep-
tember 21, 1969. He moved with his family to 
Nashville, TN when he was one year old. He 
attended Ensworth School, became a mem-
ber of Westminster Presbyterian Church, and 
graduated from University School of Nash-
ville. He then attended Kenyon College in 
Ohio where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 
Music. In 1994 he went to work for Curb 
Records in Nashville as a receptionist. 
Quickly he rose to lead the company’s pub-
lishing division. As Vice President of Pub-
lishing, he oversaw the division’s forty-five 
employees and songwriters. A classically 
trained guitarist, Drew also directed creative 
and administrative aspects of the company 
where he set budgets, signed songwriters, ne-
gotiated contracts, placed songs, and ac-
quired catalogs. 
During his tenure Curb Music Publishing 
earned 
eighty-seven 
ASCAP, 
BMI 
and 
SESAC performance awards, and set records 
for the fastest rising country single and the 
longest charting country single in Billboard 
Country chart history. In 2017, after 23 years 
at Curb, Drew stepped down from his role as 
Director of Publishing but continued work-
ing with the Mike Curb Foundation. Drew 
also founded his own company, Blair Branch 
Music. He became an active community vol-
unteer working with numerous Nashville 
agencies including Second Harvest Food 
Bank, Nashville Rescue Mission, and Room 
at the Inn. Drew’s motto was ‘‘give more 
than you take’’. When he wasn’t on the 
phone raising money for the needy he often 
could be found serving lunch at homeless 
shelters. 
Drew served on the boards of The Record-
ing Academy, Belmont School of Music, 
Family and Children’s Service, the Commu-
nity Resource Center, Leadership Music as 
Treasurer, and the Tennessee Residence 
Foundation as Secretary. He was a member 
of the Country Music Association, the Gospel 
Music Association, Academy of Country 
Music, and the Downtown Nashville Rotary 
Club. 
Drew helped many artists and songwriters 
get their start in Nashville and had many 
friends in the music industry. Over the years 
he hosted small groups of songwriters and 
artists, including Lee Brice, Bill Anderson, 
Kyle Jacobs, Billy Montana, Kelsea Ballerini 
and many others, at writing retreats at his 
family’s home at Blackberry Farm in East 
Tennessee, at Evins Mill in Middle Ten-
nessee, and at Bending Lake in Canada. 
From these dozens of sessions came more 
than 1,000 songs including many hits. Drew 
was active with the National Songwriters 
Association 
defending 
songwriters’ 
legal 
rights. 
Drew loved his daughters, his friends and 
watching sports with them all, especially the 
Tennessee Titans and University of Ten-
nessee basketball and football—and he loved 
to fish, traveling around the world in pursuit 
of new adventures. Drew is survived by two 
daughters, Lauren Blair Alexander and Helen 
Victoria Alexander of Nashville; his parents, 
Honey and Lamar Alexander of Walland, TN; 
two sisters, Leslee Alexander of Maryville, 
TN and Kathryn Alexander of Briarcliff 
Manor, NY; his brother, Will Alexander of 
Nashville; and, seven nieces and nephews. 
The Alexander family wishes to express our 
thanks to Drew’s friends Bruce Phillips and 
Hal Hardin for their many kindnesses to 
him.

REMEMBERING JOHN VICTOR

∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to pay tribute to 
John Victor Amrol, Jr., a long-time 
New Hampshire resident, State em-
ployee, and labor advocate who passed 
away recently at the age of 85. Born in

in many ways a quintessential Granite

for service that enriched his commu-
nity and improved the quality of life 
for so many across our great State. 
After graduating from nearby St. 
John’s High School in 1953, John took a 
job with the State of New Hampshire in 
our 
department 
of 
transportation, 
DOT. It was the start of a 44-year ca-
reer in highway road design. Through-
out his long tenure with DOT, John 
played a role in ensuring that our road-
ways were developed in a safe and effi-
cient manner. He also served his com-
munity and State as a member of the 
Army National Guard from 1953 to 1978. 
He retired as a master sergeant, and he 
was a proud member of American Le-
gion Post 21 for 26 years. 
John achieved so much with the de-
partment of transportation; yet as a 
longtime member of the State Employ-
ees Association (SEA)/Service Employ-
ees International Union (SEIU) Local 
1984 and its president from 1991–2000, 
his true impact transcends all that he 
accomplished in his decades of work 
with the DOT. John was a pillar of the 
SEA/SEIU, serving on nearly every 
committee and always diving deep into 
the issues that affected working people 
and their families. The union rep-
resents a wide range of occupations in 
the public and private sector workforce 
that provides critical services to our 
State. Each and every member owes a 
debt of gratitude to John. He was a 
force in fighting for their well-being, 
dignity, and fair treatment. As a nego-
tiator, John was as tough as New 
Hampshire granite. In fact, his wisdom 
and judgment at the negotiating table 
earned him the nickname ‘‘The Father 
of Collective Bargaining for State Em-
ployees’’ among his SEA colleagues. 
They also paid tribute to John by dedi-
cating their office building on North 
State Street in Concord in his name. 
John was the president of SEA/SEIU 
Local 1984 when I was elected Gov-
ernor. We shared a vision of a strong, 
secure middle class in New Hampshire 
where hard-working Granite Staters 
get a fair shot and their fair share, and 
we knew that unions play an important 
role in achieving that vision. I could 
always count on him for a fair, honest, 
and 
informed 
assessment 
of 
labor 
issues. 
The Granite State and the many peo-
ple John served are grateful for his 
many gifts and powerful advocacy. In 
the last couple of weeks, family and 
friends have gathered to share and 
cherish their many fond memories of 
him. I am with them in spirit as they 
reflect on the life of this good and gen-
erous man.∑
