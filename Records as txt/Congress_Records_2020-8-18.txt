IN HONOR OF SARA NOLAND 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mrs. Sara Noland. Mrs. Noland lives in 
Irvine, Kentucky and celebrates her 100th 
birthday on August 17th. 
Mrs. Noland grew up in Woodford County, 
Kentucky. As a junior in high school she 
began working in her school’s library. She 
went on to the University of Kentucky, where 
she earned a degree in library science. Her 
first job in 1941 was at Estill County High 
School, where she earned $90 a month. She 
married during World War II and traveled 
across the country, working at several libraries 
along the way. In 1949, she was rehired as li-
brarian of Estill County High School. While 
working there, she helped get the Estill County 
Public Library started and volunteered there 
for many years. Mrs. Noland retired in 1991 
with 42 years of dedicated service. 
Mrs. Noland has been an involved member 
of her community for many years in a variety 
of ways. She has taught Sunday School, led 
church youth groups, served as a 4–H leader, 
and was a Girl Scout leader. At the high 
school, she led a reading club, worked with 
the Academic Team, and helped with Project 
Graduation. She also volunteered with adult 
literacy. Mrs. Noland was commissioned as a 
Kentucky Colonel for her work in literacy. In 
1996 she became the first recipient of the 
Governor’s Lifetime Achievement Award for 
Volunteer Service. 
It is my honor to recognize Mrs. Sara 
Noland, celebrate her 100th birthday, and 
thank her for her many contributions to her 
community, particularly in the important area 
of literacy.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF WOMEN GAINING THE 
RIGHT TO VOTE 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the ratifi-
cation of the 19th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion, which states that ‘‘the right of citizens of 
the United States to vote shall not be denied 
or abridged by the United States or by any 
State on account of sex.’’ The right to vote is 
the foundation of our democracy and the fight 
for women’s suffrage was a generations long 
struggle. 
The 19th Amendment did not guarantee the 
right to vote for all women. Although African 
American and other suffragists of color nation-
wide worked tirelessly for suffrage, they faced 
systematic racism in the movement and were 
frequently denied their right to vote through 
harassment, intimidation, and laws that im-
posed severe restrictions. Native Americans 
and Asian Americans were denied citizenship 
and, therefore, were not eligible to vote until 
after 1924 and 1952, respectively. It was only 
in 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights 
Act that barriers to voting based on race were 
removed. 
Vermont women engaged in the suffrage 
movement for decades; notable among them: 
Clarina Howard Nichols of Townshend, who 
petitioned the legislature for voting rights in 
school district elections; Laura Moore, the 
longtime Secretary of the Vermont Woman’s 
Suffrage Association; Lucy Daniels of Grafton, 
who protested disfranchisement by refusing to 
pay her taxes; Annette Parmelee of Enosburg 
Falls, who was a persistent legislative lobbyist; 
and Lillian Olzendam of Woodstock, who orga-
nized a massive campaign to convince legisla-
tors to ratify the 19th Amendment. 
In 1919, the Vermont Legislature passed the 
Presidential suffrage bill but it was vetoed by 
Governor Percival Clement, an opponent of 
women’s suffrage. He refused to call for a 
special legislative session which would have 
allowed Vermont to become the 36th and final 
state to ratify the amendment. In response, 
400 suffragists marched through mud and 
snow to the Vermont State House in protest, 
demanding the governor allow a vote, which 
he did not. Consequently, Tennessee became 
the final ratifying state on August 18, 1920— 
100 years ago, today. 
Following the ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment, 28,159 Vermont women registered to 
vote. Edna Beard of Orange became the first 
woman to win a seat in the Vermont House of 
Representatives and was one of the Vermont 
legislators who finally ratified the 19th Amend-
ment on February 8, 1921. 
While today is a celebration of how far we 
have come and the accomplishments of the 
suffragist movement, we must also acknowl-
edge the history of the movement that 
marginalized and ostracized women of color, 
especially Black American women who fought 
tirelessly for the right to vote. Today, many ob-
stacles to voting still exist and they dispropor-
tionately affect people of color. The fight for 
voting rights, racial justice, and our democracy 
continue. As the late Congressman John 
Lewis said, ‘‘Democracy is not a state. It is an 
act.’’

HONORING 
PAFFORD 
MEDICAL 
SERVICES 
FOR 
THEIR 
EXCEP-
TIONAL SERVICE DURING COVID– 
19 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the dedicated work of 
Pafford Medical Services during COVID–19. 
This family-owned and operated EMS service 
has long held the mission of serving both 
urban and rural communities, but during this 
unprecedented time, the Pafford Medical fam-
ily has gone above and beyond expectation. 
With more than 900 employees and 120 
ambulances in a four-state region, Pafford 
Medical Services has served the people of 
rural areas like Arkansas’ Fourth District for 
more than 50 years, and during that time, they 
have created a reputation for efficient and ef-
fective disaster response. In this time of na-
tional crisis, that reputation has been proven 
true. 
As emergency medical personnel, these es-
sential workers are those that battle on the 
frontline of the COVID–19 pandemic. While 
taking no thought of their own personal safety, 
Pafford Medical has taught us all what it 
means to be a hero and a true servant of a 
community. I take this time to honor them for 
their personal sacrifice and to thank them for 
their commitment to higher service.

HONORING COACH JESSE WILLIAM 
JOSEPH AMOS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant Coach Jesse William Joseph 
Amos was born February 21, 1941 in Jackson, 
Mississippi. He was the third born of nine chil-
dren to the late Will Amos Sr. and Mary Walk-
er Amos. Jesse William Amos transitioned 
unto the Lord on the afternoon of May 14, 
2020, in Jackson, Mississippi. 
Mr. Jesse William Joseph Amos attended 
Holy Ghost Catholic School the ‘‘Comforter’’. 
Grades 1st through 12th. He graduated in May 
1959 with honors. Jesse enjoyed basketball 
and was a member of the Holy Ghost ‘‘Tigers’’ 
basketball team. He was well liked by his 
team and his classmates. He was an alter boy 
and a member of the CYO, ‘‘Catholic Youth 
Organization’’ under Father Vance Thorne 
SVD. This group of young men would take 
care of the grounds at Holy Ghost Catholic 
School and Church weekly. Jesse was the 
strong leader of the group. He loved to make 
things beautiful and clean. The group would 
cut, clean and support what was needed of 
and expected from young Catholics working 
together as a team. This is where his drive for 
‘‘Team Work’’ began. 
Mr. Amos attended Jackson State College, 
his older sister Rosie Mae Amos Washington 
was his role model. She majored in Health 
and Physical Education with a minor in Health. 
This influenced Jesse to major in the same 
field of education. He loved his sister Rosie 
and emulated her in many aspects during his 
life. Jesse went on to further his education 
and earned a Masters in Health and Physical 
Education from Jackson College, later under

the college name Jackson State University he 
earned a Specialist Degree in Health and 
Physical Education. Jesse sacrificed a lot 
while working toward his degrees. He worked 
nights from High School until he graduated 
college. He was an orderly at St. Dominic 
Hospital in Jackson, MS and waited tables at 
Primos and the Country Club of Jackson. 
He loved to work and be self-supported and 
took pride in helping his family. 
After graduation, Jesse’s 42 years of service

Rosa Scott High School, Velma Jackson High 
School, Hinds Agricultural High School and 
Upward Bound-Tougaloo College. He also 
taught Health, Physical Education and Driver 
Education at Jackson State University. 
Mr. Amos not only coached basketball but 
he also coached baseball on the little league 
and high school level. His teams at Velma 
Jackson and Hinds AHS won State Champion-
ships along with local and regional awards, 
and many other honors in their divisions. His 
sisters, Rosie and Juanita would attend most 
of them, especially Rosie. 
Mr. Amos was a serious coach. He taught 
fundamentals first, the definition of team sec-
ond followed by unity. He believed in being 
united as one. No show boating, no individ-
ualism, only team work. His coworkers, his 
teams and even his rivals respected him. To 
all of them he was a man, father, coach and 
a friend. Jesse William Joseph Amos was a 
winner. The legacy goes on.

IN MEMORY OF THE REMARKABLE 
LIFE OF ROBERT LEE JONES, SR. 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the remarkable life of Robert 
‘‘Bob’’ Lee Jones, Sr. On August 4, 2020, Bob 
returned to his creator after fulfilling a lifelong 
service as a visionary farmer and educator 
who helped shaped sustainable farming for 
Northern Ohio and America. 
Born in Zanesville and raised in Huron, OH, 
Bob embraced farming as his birthright, 
passed down from his father, Melvin ‘‘Pete’’ 
Jones, a sheep farmer in Southern Ohio. He 
and his father shared a love for farming and 
Lyman wooden boats, while he and his moth-
er, Marjorie ‘‘Mimi’’, enjoyed spending time at 
the Huron Lakefront Park. 
Having agriculture in his DNA, Bob attended 
The Ohio State University College of Food, 
Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences and 
Bowling Green State University. Academically 
gifted and scientifically curious, he proudly col-
lected and read a library of old and new agri-
cultural and business volumes over his life-
time. 
One of Bob’s proudest and dearest accom-
plishments was his six-decade long marriage 
to his beloved high school sweetheart and 
wife, Barbara. His beautiful wife Barbara built 
their Garden Enterprise at his side, a partner-
ship of love and botanical genius. Her racks of 
thousands of cookbooks and recipes formed 
foundation stones for the evolving Chefs’ Gar-
den that attracts the finest chefs in the world 
for advanced training. Together, they raised 
three remarkable children, Melvin ‘‘Lee’’, Terri 
Lynn, and Bob Jr., who will proudly continue 
their father’s work. 
The most prolific and enduring part of Bob’s 
legacy was born out of persistence and the 
strength he and his family summoned to rise 
above. After suffering a setback in the 1980s, 
Bob and his family created the Chefs’ Garden. 
The Chefs’ Garden is a mixture of traditional 
farming, innovative food safety programs, and 
education that provides fresh vegetables, 
microgreens, herbs, edible flowers to chefs 
with an ‘‘Earth-to-Table’’ philosophy. For the 
past three decades, Bob lead his family to cat-
apult their operation into a force, which pro-
vides chefs in 50 states and 14 countries with 
flavorful, sustainable, and high class produce. 
Ever evolving, Bob’s business became a bo-
tanical science campus, with plants and stu-
dents from nearby and around the world com-
ing to partake in his Culinary Vegetable Insti-
tute. The Institute is a world class educational, 
research, and event facility where chefs and 
their teams come to immerse themselves in 
revitalizing education or team building mis-
sions. Bob’s dedication to his craft knew no 
bounds, and he wanted to share that with the 
chief benefactors of his mission, chefs. 
Bob and Barbara’s passion for education 
yielded their nationwide nonprofit-Veggie U. 
Nothing could equal ‘‘Farmer Jones’’ in his 
denim jeans trekking to schools everywhere 
with Grow Kits to educate children and teach-
ers for the next generation about the magical 
power of the productive earth. Veggie U edu-
cates children on the processes of planting, 
growing, harvesting crops, as well as healthy 
eating strategies, in their classroom. They also 
offer a dedicated program for special needs 
students. The program has sprouted 8,300 
classroom gardens and graduated 207,500 
students in 36 states. Veggie U ensures Bob 
and his family’s mission will remain steadfast 
for many generations to follow. 
One of Bob’s last gifts to his country came 
during the Coronavirus pandemic. He and his 
family were devising plans to get fresh 
produce to the needy well before federal as-
sistance was implemented. They are patriots, 
participating in USDA’s Farmers to Families 
Food Box program, providing their world-class 
produce to help feed those devastated by the 
pandemic. His desire to ensure people were 
properly nourished persisted until his last 
breath, and with the help of his beautiful fam-
ily, will continue. 
Robert Lee Jones, Sr. was a giant among 
men. His focus and dedication to agriculture 
never wavered and furthered the progress of 
American farming. I send my deepest condo-
lences to his family, especially his beloved 
wife, children, grandchildren, and the many 
people who were touched by his life. May they 
find solace in the faith Bob held so dear, and 
may the angels raise him to a place of peace 
and comfort which he so richly deserves.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JIMMY E. MILLER 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Jimmy E. Miller, a lifelong na-
tive of Jasper, Texas and faithful servant to 
his community. 
Jimmy was born on November 3, 1964, to 
Will and Dianne Miller in Jasper, Texas. Grow-
ing up, Jimmy worked at his father’s family 
owned store, ‘‘Miller’s Grocery Bait and Tack-
le.’’ It was at his father’s bait and tackle shop 
that he learned the value of community as well 
as his desire to help others and exhibit the 
compassionate love of God. Later in his adult 
life, Jimmy served the residents of Jasper’s 
precinct 2 for 20 years as a member of the 
Road and Bridge crew. He worked for three 
different commissioners during his tenure and 
went about his job with dignity and kindness, 
just as he lived his life. He worked on dump 
trucks, front end loaders, and on maintainers 
fixing roads—always building relationships 
with those he encountered. 
On April 3, 1993, Jimmy married the love of 
his life, Druscilla Rogers. For the last 27 
years, they shared a wonderful life together, 
packed full of cherished memories and more 
love than one could imagine. The couple had 
and raised one child, Will Miller of Jasper. 
Druscilla and Jimmy both possessed a com-
passionate love for helping others, and that 
was felt by all whom they encountered. 
In 2018, Jimmy was elected Justice of the 
Peace (JP) for precinct 2 of Jasper County. 
While serving as JP, Jimmy found his greatest 
and final podium to do the Lord’s work. From 
praying with bereaved family members at an 
inquest to having long talks with community 
members sitting across the desk from him, 
Jimmy was so proud to serve and assist his 
community. On many occasions he could be 
heard to say, ‘‘I have the best job ever. I get 
to help people and tell them about Jesus.’’ 
Jimmy was also committed to serving the 
young people of his community. He and his 
wife, Druscilla, founded the Jasper County 4– 
H shooting sports program and used the rop-
ing pen behind their house as the county’s 
own practice arena. The pair devoted count-
less hours to the growth and development of 
multiple Jasper County 4–H programs, where 
Jimmy served as the chairman of the goat- 
show and on the buyers committee for the 
Jasper County Junior Livestock Association. 
He also faithfully organized and oversaw the 
mutton bustin portion of the Jasper Lions Club 
Rodeo for the last 10 years. 
As a compassionate follower of Christ, 
Jimmy was one of the founding members of 
the Jasper County Cowboy Church and 
served as trustee, team leader, and arena di-
rector for the worship center. Jimmy felt that it

was his calling to serve God in whatever ca-
pacity He allowed, and spent innumerable 
hours witnessing to those he met at church, at 
his father’s bait and tackle shop, during ro-
deos and 4–H meetings, and most recently, to 
the nurses at the hospital where he spent his 
final days. Jimmy was considered by many as 
a gentle giant who never met a stranger and 
exuded a sense of compassion, under-
standing, and pure love to all. 
Jimmy is preceded in death by his father, 
Will Miller. He is survived by his mother and 
step-father, Dianne and Bobby Glover of Jas-
per; wife, Druscilla Miller of Jasper; one son, 
Will Miller and Kayla Tierney of Lufkin; two 
sisters, Delores Warner and husband Gary of 
Jasper and Amie Smith and husband Trey of 
Orangefield and mother-in-law, Ann Rogers of 
Jasper. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. 
Jimmy E. Miller, for his many years of faithful 
service to his community. My thoughts and 
prayers remain with his family and friends dur-
ing this difficult time.

HONORING OLA KIRK 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Lieutenant Ola Kirk (Calvit) 
who retired from the Mississippi State High-
way Patrol after 321⁄2 years of service. She 
was among the first African American women 
to enter this service within the State of Mis-
sissippi. She has served the State with integ-
rity, dignity, and of good principle. She worked 
primarily in the Mississippi Delta and Jackson 
areas. Her journey has not been an easy, 
however, ‘‘Nevertheless, She Persisted’’. Con-
currently, she also served in the United States 
Army Reserve for 21 years, retiring as a 1st 
Sargent. She is also a graduate of Mississippi 
Valley State. She has been a mentor for many 
of her peers, as well as a contributor to the 
communities in which she worked. She estab-
lished a non-profit faith-based agency ‘‘Oper-
ation Outreach’’ which provides support to ‘‘at- 
promise’’ children and youth to equip them 
with the tools needed to navigate society. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Lieutenant Ola Kirk.

RETIREMENT OF MS. DRU 
WYCKOFF, U.S. ARMY 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service of Ms. Dru Wyckoff, 
of the United States Army Budget Office, for 
her extraordinary dedication to duty and distin-
guished service to our nation. 
On 31 May 2020, Ms. Dru Wyckoff retired 
from the Department of the Army after nearly 
40 years of government service. Throughout 
her distinguished career, Ms. Wyckoff served 
successfully in a variety of operational and 
leadership roles within the Financial Manage-
ment career field. Her career culminated with 
her selection as a member of the Senior Exec-
utive Service when she served for 5 years as 
the Director of Management and Control for 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for 
Budget. 
Ms. Wyckoff, the daughter of Don and Irene 
Coffelt, was raised in Ponca City, Oklahoma. 
She graduated from Northern Oklahoma Col-
lege and Oklahoma State University. She 
began her government career as a Depart-
ment of the Army Civilian in December 1980. 
She served in several positions as a Budget 
Analyst, Auditor, and Management Analyst, 
with the US Army in Berlin, Germany, until No-
vember 1986. 
Transferring to the National Capital Region 
in 1987, Ms. Wyckoff served as a Manage-
ment Analyst, Program Analyst, and Super-
visory Budget Analyst in the US Army Per-
sonnel Command, and later as a Budget Ana-
lyst for the Army Budget Office beginning in 
February 1998. 
In her role as the Army Budget Office’s pri-
mary integrator and representative during the 
development of the Army Program Objective 
Memorandum and the Total Army Plan, Ms. 
Wyckoff supported the Army’s annual budget 
submission while directing the fiscal manage-
ment of funds over the three years of budget 
focus. She oversaw execution funds control 
and reprogramming actions of monies appro-
priated by Congress. Ms. Wyckoff expertly en-
sured compliance with fiscal limitations and in-
structions contained in Congressional acts and 
reports. 
With 
every 
assignment, 
Ms. 
Wyckoff 
brought unparalleled leadership and unques-
tioned commitment to the Army’s Soldiers, 
family members, and civilians, and while she 
never sought recognition or acclaim, she 
quietly and diligently earned the trust, con-
fidence, and respect of Army senior leaders, 
the Army Secretariat, and the entire Depart-
ment of Defense financial management com-
munity. 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recog-
nize Ms. Wyckoff’s highly successful career 
and nearly 40 years of distinguished public 
service to the Army and the Nation. We are 
grateful for patriotic Americans of character 
and commitment like Ms. Wyckoff who faith-
fully and zealously subordinate self to improve 
the lives of others. Ms. Wyckoff has dedicated 
her life to selflessly promote and advance 
freedom and democracy, and I wish her and 
her family all the very best.

HONORING GRANNIS FACILITY OF 
TYSON FOODS FOR THEIR ES-
SENTIAL WORK DURING COVID–19 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the exceptional work of Tyson 
Foods Company in keeping Americans well 
fed and supplied during unprecedented times. 
The Grannis, Arkansas location, along with 
several others in the Fourth District, have kept 
their doors open, making heroes of the men 
and women who work in their facilities. 
During COVID–19, our country has endured 
not just a pandemic, but the economic strug-
gles that result. It is because of the efforts of 
essential workers like these and the dedication 
of Tyson Food, Inc. that our store shelves will 
stay stocked and many Americans will not go 
hungry. 
I take this time to honor their work and to 
thank the exceptional men and women who 
have ignored fear or concern for personal 
safety in the battle to feed our communities. It 
is from them that we should find the ultimate 
example of what it means to be a front line 
hero in a time of national crisis.

THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS 
ACT AND THE CHUGACH ALASKA 
CORPORATION 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise con-
cerning the recent passage by the Senate, 
and the House, and enactment by the Presi-
dent, of the Great American Outdoors Act, 
H.R. 1957 as passed in the House, and now 
P.L. 116–152. 
I rise to highlight and speak to an issue of 
critical importance to Chugach Alaska Cor-
poration (CAC), the Alaska Native Claims Set-
tlement Act (ANCSA) Regional Corporation for 
the Alaska Natives of the Chugach Region. 
Today, Federal Land Management Agencies, 
and the States, are on the cusp of imple-
menting P.L. 116–152, the Great American 
Outdoors Act (GAOA). One of the central pur-
poses of GAOA is to provide permanent fund-
ing, at the fully authorized level, for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). I have 
worked tirelessly with Members on both sides 
of the aisle to accomplish the principal provi-
sions of the GAOA—in fact, the legislation is 
very similar to language that I sponsored

years ago which passed the House as the 
Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA). I 
worked hand in hand with Members on both 
sides of the aisle to permanently authorize the 
LWCF when we passed the bipartisan John D. 
Dingell, Jr. Conservation Management and 
Recreation Act (P.L. 116–9), in early 2019. I 
want to emphasize that a priority use of the 
LWCF funding, provided for in the enacted 
GAOA, is the consolidation of ownership and 
management of split estate federal and public 
lands, in appropriate circumstances such as 
that referred to in Section 1113, the ‘‘Chugach 
Region Land Study,’’ contained in P.L. 116–9 
the ‘‘Dingell Act,’’ between willing private sec-
tor land owners and the United States, espe-
cially when such willing private sector land 
owners are Native American Tribes or Alaska 
Native 
Regional 
Corporations 
established 
under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act. 
It is important to clearly declare that the 
LWCF can, among and between willing par-
ties, be used for this purpose of facilitating 
and executing recommended land exchanges 
per the Chugach Region Land Study provi-
sion, Section 1113 of the Dingell Act. This un-
derstanding and direction is completely con-
sistent with that Act and the GAOA.

HONORING LELA HENDERSON- 
JONES 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Lela Hender-
son-Jones. 
Lela Henderson-Jones was born March 11, 
1970 to the late Robert and Lee Ethel Hender-
son in Tunica, MS. She is the eleventh of four-
teen children (9 sisters and 5 brothers). Two 
siblings have preceded her in death but the 
remaining twelve continue to have a close re-
lationship. She was a teenage mother, living in 
a poverty-stricken community with limited re-
sources available. Today, whenever she gains 
the opportunity, she loves encouraging others 
to persevere regarding of what the cir-
cumstances may be. 
Lela Henderson-Jones went to Rosa Fort 
High School in Tunica, Mississippi where she 
was in the top ten of her class. Before grad-
uating high school, Lela was the mother of two 
children. Lela refused to allow her bad choices 
to affect her education. Once again, she is 
grateful for the support of her family that knew 
her potentials and wouldn’t allow her to drop 
out of high school. She attended Northwest 
Community College to pursue a degree in 
nursing. One semester later, she left college 
to marry and raise her children. She realized 
that nursing is something she did not want to 
do. Lela spent years working in hotels to help 
support her family. She gained employment at 
the local factory (Pillowtex) in the town of 
Tunica. 
In 1994, Lela and her family moved to Horn 
Lake, MS due to lack of housing in Tunica 
County. During this time, she was married, 
had three children (two girls and one son), 
and was about to give birth to another child. 
She commuted to Tunica daily to work and 
spend time with her parents. After the death of 
her father and a brother, Lela obtained em-
ployment in Desoto County as a factory work-
er. After losing the desire for factory work and 
feeling unfulfilled, Lela made some major deci-
sion that would affect her role as a wife and 
a mother. She decided to return to college to 
work on a career. 
Lela Henderson-Jones attended Northwest 
Community College to study sociology. She 
was employed by Tunica County School Dis-
trict as a Child Care Provider while attending 
Northwest. Her goal was to get back to 
Tunica. After her first year of college and help 
from her advisor, she decided to change her 
major to Social Work. She received her Bach-
elor’s degree in Social Work from the Univer-
sity of Mississippi. Mrs. Henderson-Jones ob-
tained employment with Region One Mental 
Health Center as a Case Manager. This was 
the career path that she believed was her true 
calling in Tunica County. She had the oppor-
tunity of coordinating a Senior Program at Re-
gion One called ‘‘Silver Pathfinders.’’ 
During her tenure with Region One Mental 
Health, Lela received her Master’s in Social 
Work from Mississippi Valley State University. 
She received the position as County Coordi-
nator that carried the roles of a certified thera-
pist for individual and families, group therapist 
for anger management and A&D counselor, 
and case manager/ therapist for mobile Crisis. 
Currently, she holds the position as Clinic 
Operations 
Assistant 
for 
Tunica 
County 
Healthcare Authority. She assists with the 
daily operation of the only two rural health 
clinics in Tunica County. She is a Board Mem-
ber for Mid-State Opportunity (Community Ac-
tion Agency), and a Board Member for Tunica 
County Community Development Coalition 
(TCCDC). She’s on the ministerial staff at Holy 
Ghost Temple Church in Dundee, MS. 
Lela 
Henderson-Jones 
credits 
all 
her 
achievements to God, her children (Camille, 
Damecos, Colundria, and Dijuan) and her fam-
ily for supporting her and never giving up on 
her. She’s dedicated to her community and 
the people in the community. Mrs. Jones is 
recognized for her services to her community 
and passion for her community and the people 
in the community is displayed daily. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Lela Henderson-Jones for 
her dedication to serving her community and 
this great state.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BATTLE OF WAR-
SAW 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring appropriate Congressional rec-
ognition to the 100th Anniversary of the Battle 
of Warsaw. 
In 1920 a young Polish Republic, that just 
regained independence after 123 years of for-
eign domination, faced an existential threat 
from a Soviet invasion. For Vladimir Lenin and 
the Soviet leadership, the conquest of Poland 
was to serve as a steppingstone for a Soviet 
advance into western Europe. On August 12, 
1920, the Soviet Red Army began its assault 
upon Warsaw and for the next fifteen days, 
the battle was fought not just for the future of 
the Polish Republic, but for all free societies in 
Europe. Under the unwavering leadership of 
Jo´zef Pilsudski, the Polish army executed a 
brilliant counterattack and shattered the Red 
Army, forcing the Soviets to retreat. Lord 
DAbernon, who was part of a British mission 
in Warsaw during the battle, wrote in the New 
York Times on its 10th anniversary that there 
were few incidents in the history of civilization 
of greater importance than the Battle of War-
saw. By winning the encounter, which since 
has been called ‘‘The Miracle on the Vistula,’’ 
the Polish army saved Poland and the rest of 
Europe from a Communist takeover and pre-
served freedom and democracy for millions. 
While we pay tribute to those who bravely 
fought to stop the Soviet invasion, it is impor-
tant to recognize the role that was played in 
the battle by a group of 21 American pilots 
who formed a united called the Kosciuszko 
Squadron and flew many missions during the 
battle providing critical aerial support to Polish 
ground forces. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in tribute to 
the sacrifice, courage, and heart of the Polish 
forces who bravely defended their homeland 
during the Battle of Warsaw. This was a strik-
ing example how yearning for freedom, justice, 
and independence can motivate in times of 
great peril and while facing seemingly insur-
mountable odds. In August 1920, the Polish 
army along with the help of U.S. troops, saved 
Europe from an evil totalitarian dictatorship. 
Today, we should honor and celebrate the 
Polish soldiers who bravely fought not for just 
the freedom of their homeland, but for the lib-
erty and justice for all. We should also use 
this opportunity to recognize the strong friend-
ship between the United States and the Polish 
Republic, who has been a loyal ally in Europe 
for the last three decades.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MICHAEL ‘‘MIKE’’ M. PADDIE 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and service of Michael ‘‘Mike’’ 
M. Paddie a long-time resident of Warren, 
Texas, faithful educator, and servant of his 
community. 
Mike was born on December 24, 1957 to 
Maurice and Lillian Paddie in Washington, 
D.C. Mr. Paddie was a long-time resident of 
Warren, Texas and spent over 40 years work-
ing for Warren Independent School District. 
Throughout the years he served the district in 
many capacities, as a teacher, coach, and 
counselor and most recently, as Assistant to 
the Superintendent. Mike oversaw at least a 
thousand students each year but was known 
for making each and every student feel valued 
and respected. He was loved by his former 
students, and many thought of him not only as 
a teacher and coach, but as a mentor, father 
figure, and dear friend. 
Mike was also known as the ‘‘the voice of 
the Warren Warriors’’, where he served as the 
announcer at the Warrior football games. In 
2012, Warren ISD named the baseball and 
softball fields’ press boxes after him in honor 
of his many years of service. The school dis-
trict also has a scholarship named in Mr.

Mr. Paddie also served his community in

merous local causes and was elected the Re-
publican Chairman of Tyler County and held 
that position for many years. He also served 
as a Rotarian in the Woodville Rotary Club,

kindness, generosity, and good humor in his 
work for the good of others. Mike embodied 
the Rotary motto, ‘‘Service above Self’ in ev-
erything he did. 
Mr. Paddie is preceded in death by his par-
ents, Maurice and Lillian Paddie. He is sur-

HONORING ERRICK D. SIMMONS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Mr. Errick D. Simmons. 
After a historic landslide win for mayor in 
2015, Mayor Errick D. Simmons, the first black 
male mayor of the City of Greenville, Mis-
sissippi, won re-election to his second term as 
mayor in 2019 without facing an opposing 
candidate. Mayor Errick D. Simmons began 
his career in municipal government as a city 
councilman in 2007, as the youngest to serve 
in the position at that time. 
Before returning home to Greenville to start 
his legal and municipal government career, 
Simmons graduated salutatorian in his class at 
T.L. Weston High School in 1995, second to 
his twin brother and law partner, Mississippi 
State Senator Derrick T. Simmons, who is the 
Senate Minority Leader for Democratic Party. 
Simmons later studied at Jackson State Uni-
versity, where he received a Bachelor in Busi-
ness Administration in Economics in 2000. In 
2002, he received a Master’s in Arts in Eco-
nomics from Howard University Graduate 
School of Arts and Sciences and received his 
Juris Doctorate from Howard University School 
of Law in 2005. 
While at Howard University School of Law, 
Simmons was team captain of the Howard 
University Huver I. Brown Trial Advocacy 
Team, the first HBCU law school to win the 
American Bar Association Competition, defeat-
ing two-time reigning champion Harvard Uni-
versity. This historic win was placed in the 
Congressional Record, and featured across 
national media outlets including but not limited 
to Chicago Defender, Dallas Examiner, Ebony, 
and Jet Magazine. 
Currently, Simmons serves as a member of 
several local, state, and national boards and 
organizations, to name a few: President, Mis-
sissippi Delta Mayors Association, 1st Vice 
President of Mississippi Municipal League 
(MML) (to be sworn in as President in June 
2021), Vice President of Delta Council, Mis-
sissippi Economic Council Board of Gov-
ernors, Boys Scouts of America, U.S. Con-
ference of Mayors, National League of Cities, 
life member of NAACP, life member of Mag-
nolia Bar Association, life member of Kappa 
Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., board member of 
Mississippi Association of Justice, Mississippi 
Bar Association, and Chairman of Washington 
County Democratic Executive Committee. 
In the Christian spirit of unity, Mayor Sim-
mons pushed a message of ‘‘One People, 
One Goal, and One Greenville: We are One’’ 
to promote unity and foster togetherness when 
he became mayor in 2016. The community 
has taken on the call to unify and work more 
collectively for a better Greenville. Keeping 
God as the center of his administration, Sim-
mons first initiative was a faith-based one enti-
tled, ‘‘Worship on the Water’’ where faith- 
based leaders across the Mississippi Delta 
joined him for such announcement. Worship 
on the Water is a nationally recognized, inter-
faith, interracial initiative that fosters commu-
nity and promote unity on the fifth Sunday, of 
every month purposed on bringing people to-
gether regardless of racial identity or religious 
affiliation. Simmons states, ‘‘Psalm 100 de-
mands us to make a joyful noise unto the 
Lord. On the fifth Sunday of every month, resi-
dents and citizens come and worship at the 
water on our levee front to make a joyful noise 
together in corporate worship. Folks are not 
restricted by the color of their skin nor con-
fined by their churches’ addresses. We come 
to exalt God as one community.’’ Worship on 
the Water received the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors’ 
2017 
City 
Livability 
Outstanding 
Achievement Award presented by President 
Bill Clinton. 
In the name of social justice, racial equity, 
and inclusion for all, the very first order of 
business for Mayor Simmons as Mayor of 
Greenville was the removal of the Mississippi 
State flag containing the confederate emblem 
from all municipal buildings in January of 
2016. 
Simmons later announced the City’s first 
ever re-entry program entitled, Greenville Re- 
Entry and Training Program (GREAT), a pro-
gram aimed to hire and train returning citizens 
throughout the City. The City of Greenville 
hired its very first returning citizen on March 1, 
2018. Under his administration as mayor, 
Greenville has announced more than $200 
million in local, state, federal, and corporate 
investments including the announcement of a 
$40.1 million new federal courthouse; a 
$71.46 million Greenville Freight Corridor By-
pass from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding 
America program; $25 million MARS Uncle 
Ben’s R & D Investment; a $9.l million rede-
velopment of the Sears, Roebuck & Company 
building to include a boutique hotel, micro-
brewery, downtown restaurant, and butcher 
shop. 
In August 2018, an estimated 100 new jobs 
were announced through economic develop-
ment projects. Nufarm announced 68 manu-
facturing jobs with a $20 million investment, 
the first such announcement in Greenville 
since Textron in 2004. Tru by Hilton an-
nounced an 84 room hotel with 30 jobs with 
an estimated $10 million investment. 
Some other accomplishments in his admin-
istration are worth noting: ‘‘Announced the Re-

create safe and affordable housing.

RECOGNIZING THE EAST PARKER 
COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the East Parker County 
Chamber of Commerce on earning a 5-Star 
Accreditation from the United States Chamber 
of Commerce. 
The East Parker County Chamber of Com-
merce became the smallest ever chamber to 
be honored with 5-star accreditation from the 
United States Chamber of Commerce. They 
received the award for their sound policies, ef-
fective organizational procedures, and positive 
impact on the community. 
The organization, which serves part of 
Parker County, including Willow Park, Hudson 
Oaks and Aledo, is also one of just four such 
accredited chambers in Texas and one of only 
128 across the United States. 
The East Parker County Chamber came 
from small and humble beginnings. In 1996, it 
held its first meeting at the function room of an 
RV park located near Aledo, Texas. The 
chamber had only 50 members at the time 
and held potluck lunch-time meetings. Be-
cause the meetings were informal, friendly, 
and comfortable, they attracted more business 
owners. 
From day one, the chamber grew at a 
steady pace. Now it is 520 plus members- 
strong, a dynamic force for promoting com-
merce in the eastern portion of Parker county. 
It enriches, promotes, and advocates for busi-
ness growth that enhances its members and 
our community. As Parker county continues to 
grow, I know the chamber will remain true to 
its purpose and maintain the personal touch 
that it has had since the beginning. 
I am proud of the work the chamber does 
for my constituents in Parker County, and this 
accreditation validates all they do for our local 
economy and our community. 
On behalf of Texas’ 12th Congressional Dis-
trict, I offer my congratulations to the East 
Parker County Chamber of Commerce on this 
tremendous achievement.

HONORING 
COMMUNITY 
STATE 
BANK IN BRADLEY FOR THEIR 
EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE DURING 
COVID–19 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 18, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the dedication and hard 
work of the Bradley, Arkansas branch of Com-
munity State Bank. During unprecedented 
times, these individuals have risen to the chal-
lenge of serving the economic needs of Fourth 
District citizens. 
Individuals and businesses across the na-
tion have faced the financial consequences of 
a weakened economy during COVID–19. The 
Community State Bank team has worked tire-
lessly throughout this year to ensure the suc-
cess of Arkansas small businesses with Pay-
check Protection Program loans and assist-
ance. Without their hard work, many Arkan-
sans would be facing a much more difficult fu-
ture. 
Essential workers, like those in Community 
State Bank, exemplify what it means to be a 
frontline hero. It is a joy to hear of their efforts

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam

Atlanta, GA. In furthering her passion, Dr. 
Harden obtained a Master of Science in Public 
Health in Environmental Toxicology from 
Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical 
Medicine prior to completing a distinguished 
fellowship with the CDC’s Public Health Prac-
tice Program Office’s Laboratory Training 
Branch. With years of applied research experi-
ence and a sustained commitment to elimi-
nating health disparities, Dr. Harden pursued a 
Medical Doctorate at UMMC. After completion, 
Dr. Harden accepted a Rural Family Medicine 
Residency at LSUHSC-Shreveport. 
Since 2013, Dr. Harden continues to serve 
patients and communities of the Mississippi 
Delta, in addition she volunteers as a health
