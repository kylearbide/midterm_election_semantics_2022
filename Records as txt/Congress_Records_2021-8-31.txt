PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy and eternal God, in whose care 
time finds its meaning and life its 
boundaries, we pray for this moment in 
time when our adversaries have proven 
callous in their understanding of the 
sanctity of human life and their ac-
tions have betrayed their hubris by in-
citing violence and inflaming fear and 
panic. 
We pray Your intercession on behalf 
of all those who face the harsh cruelty 
of terrorism, who cling desperately for 
a chance at freedom, and those who can 
but only watch their friends and family 
fall prey to the inhumanity that 
threatens to extinguish all hope of re-
union. 
We pray Your protection over those 
who, this day, give selflessly of their 
efforts and even their lives that this 
kind of savagery would not win, who 
believe that an act of kindness, a com-
mitment to service, and a resolute pur-
pose, can hold back the tides of hatred 
and heartlessness. 
And to those who grieve of loss of 
precious life and longed-for liberty, we 
pray Your tender mercies. Because of 
Your great love, which transcends all 
measure of malice, may they not be 
consumed. May Your compassion never 
fail them. Be their portion as they 
await Your salvation. We offer these 
prayers in Your merciful name. 
Amen.

LETTER FROM VETERANS ON THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE ONGOING 
EVACUATION 
EFFORTS 
IN 
AF-
GHANISTAN 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, as a combat 
veteran who served three tours of duty, both 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, I understand the dan-
ger and lasting implications of war. We mourn 
for the U.S. servicemembers killed in the Au-
gust 26 attack in Kabul. These service mem-
bers were engaged in a mission to save the 
lives of others, and we should never forget 
their service and sacrifice. 
As we grieve with the rest of America, we 
must commit to evacuating U.S. citizens and 
our Afghan partners, regardless of the August 
31st deadline. I recognize this operation is not 
without risk, but I believe it is both a moral 
and national security imperative to see this 
evacuation to completion. 
Therefore, I include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing letter signed by 600 veterans on the 
importance of continued evacuation efforts. I 
look forward to our continued work to bring 
our brave service members, U.S. citizens, and 
Afghan partners to safety. 
VETERANS’ LETTER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN ON 
AFGHANISTAN 
AUGUST 25, 2021. 
President JOE BIDEN, 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: As veterans of the 
U.S. Armed Forces, we are writing to express 
our strong and unwavering support for the 
ongoing evacuation efforts for U.S. citizens 
and our Afghan allies being led by the United 
States at the Hamid Karzai International 
Airport. 
Throughout our military service, we have 
seen firsthand the importance of not just the 
interpreters 
who 
worked 
alongside 
our 
troops on the battlefield, but also the thou-
sands of Afghans who directly supported our 
American 
mission 
through 
U.S.-funded 
NGOs, contractors, and other implementers. 
These civilian operations—led by the Af-
ghans working on U.S. funded projects—have 
been vital for U.S. national security and for 
empowering millions of women and girls. 
The grave danger now faced by these Afghan 
allies and their families cannot be over-
stated. 
We are also deeply worried that this group 
of Afghans—individuals who qualify for Pri-
ority 2 refugee status—could be largely left 
behind by the current U.S. military evacu-
ation efforts. We fear that the U.S. will fail 
in its moral duty to protect these individuals 
who stood directly with America. 
Therefore, we write with three specific and 
urgent requests for your Administration: 
1. Prioritize U.S.-led evacuations for poten-
tial and qualifying Priority 2 applicants and 
their families for evacuation efforts along-
side potential Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) 
applicants and U.S. citizens. 
2. Extend the evacuation mission past Au-
gust 31, 2021—not just for U.S. citizens—but 
for all our Afghan allies that worked along-
side us in the military and U.S. civilian mis-
sions, assuming everyone cannot be evacu-
ated by the deadline. 
3. Ensure safe corridors for evacuees to ac-
cess the Kabul airport. 
Thank you for your attention and leader-
ship to help get all our Afghan allies to safe-
ty. As we all know, time is of the essence. 
Very respectfully, 
Russell McLachlan, Joseph Snowden, Anne 
Hobbs, Birmingham, Neil Rafferty, Dena

HONORING MR. MAC WOODWARD 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the distinguished career and public 
service of Mr. Mac Woodward. 
As a sixth generation resident of Huntsville, 
Mr. Woodward has long valued making an ac-
tive difference in his community. In 1970, Mac 
received his Bachelor of Arts in History from 
Sam Houston State University, soon followed 
with his Master of Arts in History from the Uni-
versity of Houston’s Institute for Public History. 
Mac’s passion for history brought him to 
work at the Sam Houston Memorial Museum 
as a historical interpreter in 1994. Impres-
sively, Mac was named the museum’s curator 
of collections just one year later. Mac also 
performed museum-related activities with the 
Houston Museum of Natural Science, Bob Bul-
lock Texas State History Museum, Institute of 
Texan Cultures, Texas Highways, and the De-
partment of Interior National Historic Landmark 
Report. With decades of experience, Mac was 
named Director of the Sam Houston Memorial 
Museum at Sam Houston State University on 
January 1, 2012. Mr. Woodward exhibited a 
passion for educating the public on the life 
and history of Sam Houston. As a result of his 
effort, an historic bust of Sam Houston was 
displayed in the United States Capitol in the 
Ways and Means Committee Room from 2016 
to 2019. 
During his time as a Council member, Mac 
was the Mayor Pro Tempore and Chairman of 
the Finance Committee. He then went on to 
serve four terms on the Huntsville City Council 
before successfully being elected Mayor in 
2011. During his 12-year tenure as both a city 
councilman and the mayor of Huntsville, Mac 
Woodward demonstrated servant leadership 
throughout his tenure in office. In 2015, Wood-
ward was voted Citizen of the Year and in 
2016, he was named The Huntsville Item’s 
Public Servant of the Year. These awards re-
flect the high esteem with which Mac is held 
by the Huntsville community. 
Mr. Woodward has also served on the Advi-
sory Boards of both the City of Huntsville’s 
Parks and Recreation and Oakwood Ceme-
tery. In addition, Mac has always remained ac-
tively involved serving as a board member for 
foundations and organizations, project man-
ager for several historic preservation efforts, 
and committee member for countless public 
events. 
I am proud to join Mr. Woodward’s family 
and friends to honor Mac’s distinguished ca-
reer and thank him for his leadership and 
dedication to public service.

HONORING 
REVA 
LOBATOS 
ON 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
2021 
WYO-
MING 
AGRICULTURE 
IN 
THE 
CLASSROOM EDUCATOR OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Reva Lobatos on 
being named the 2021 Wyoming Agriculture in 
the Classroom Educator of the Year. 
Reva Lobatos currently teaches fourth grade 
at Fort Washakie Elementary in Fremont 
County and is active in her school, education 
communities, and WAIC programs. Over the 
past four years, Reva has taught the Wyoming 
Stewardship Program to her fourth grade stu-
dents on the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
These lessons provide a meaningful way for 
Reva to discuss natural resources, the eco-
nomic impacts of those resources, and caring 
for the land. 
Over the past year, as the Covid–19 pan-
demic forced our children to attend school vir-
tually, Reva found new and creative ways to 
give her students a hands-on learning experi-
ence. She utilized resources from the Wyo-
ming Stewardship Program to allow her stu-
dents to explore Devil’s Tower and a Wyoming 
trona mine through virtual field trips. This new 
and creative way of teaching allowed her stu-
dents to engage with the curriculum and de-
velop an interest in our unique landmarks. 
This outstanding accomplishment is a true 
reflection of Reva’s hard work, dedication, and 
commitment to her students. Washakie Ele-
mentary school is lucky to have someone who 
puts students first and finds new and creative 
ways to make learning interactive for their stu-
dents. 
I thank Reva for her dedication to Wyoming 
students and contributions to education.

RETIREMENT OF KURT HYDE, THE 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS INSPEC-
TOR GENERAL 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Kurt Hyde for his many years 
of dedicated service to the Library on the oc-
casion of his retirement. Mr. Hyde was invalu-
able in setting the Library on a path of mod-
ernization and performance-driven strategy. 
Mr. Hyde has had a long and illustrious ca-
reer in the public, nonprofit and private sec-
tors, in positions devoted to the public interest. 
Prior to serving as the Library’s Inspector 
General, he was the deputy inspector general 
for audit and evaluations at the Special In-
spector General for the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program, a sophisticated, white collar law en-
forcement agency established to prevent 
waste, fraud, and abuse in the $700 billion 
program. 
Similarly, he served as the deputy assistant 
inspector general for the Resolution Trust Cor-
poration during the savings and loan financial 
crisis in the 1990s. Other government service 
included work at the Government Account-
ability Office and as a senior executive at the 
Department of Transportation Office of Inspec-
tor General. In the private sector, Mr. Hyde 
was a partner in the government services 
practice at big 5 accounting and consulting 
firm. He also consulted to a non-profit whose 
mission was to develop transformational lead-
ers for primary and secondary schools. 
Although we will miss Mr. Hyde’s hard work 
and dedication to the Library, we wish him 
well as he embarks upon his well-deserved re-
tirement. Please join me in thanking Mr. Hyde 
for his years of outstanding service.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FORMER COLORADO GOVERNOR 
RICHARD LAMM 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and achievements 
of Colorado’s former Governor Richard ‘‘Dick’’ 
Lamm who passed away on Thursday, July 
29, 2021, at the age of 85. 
Governor Lamm was born and raised in the 
Midwest and lived all over the country in his 
youth, but he found his true home after he 
came to Colorado in 1962. In the nearly 60 
years he lived in the state, he was a visionary 
leader helping craft the policies that became 
the bedrock of Colorado’s future. 
When he moved to Colorado, Dick was a 
newly-minted lawyer and an accountant. He 
established a law practice, but his strong de-
sire to serve beckoned him to run for the Col-
orado House of Representatives. He was 
elected in 1964 and immediately began mak-
ing a lasting mark on our state. 
Then-Representative Lamm was a fierce ad-
vocate for women’s reproductive health. In 
1973, just three years after the Roe v. Wade 
Supreme Court decision, he passed the na-
tion’s first liberalized abortion law, enabling 
Colorado women to have control over their 
own health care. The law, still in effect today, 
has served as a national model for women’s 
reproductive rights. 
Concerned about transparency in govern-
ment, Dick cosponsored and helped pass the 
Colorado Open Records Act which has since 
granted countless Coloradans access to their 
state and local governments’ documents and 
activities on their behalf. 
One of Dick’s deepest passions was to pre-
serve our precious environment. After he 
moved to Colorado, he became an avid out-
doorsman and advocate for environmental jus-
tice and preservation. In 1972, concerned 
about the potential effects of the 1976 Olym-
pics on Colorado’s fragile ecosystem, he led 
the successful ballot initiative in which Colo-
rado voters refused to fund the games, caus-
ing Denver to become the first host city in his-
tory to pull out of already-awarded games. 
In 1974, Dick ran for governor to further his 
progressive agenda. During his campaign, he 
famously walked the entire state to support his 
platform of limiting growth to protect our envi-
ronment. He went on to serve at the helm for 
12 years, from 1975 to 1987. 
In keeping with his strong advocacy for gen-
der and racial equality, he diversified state 
government. His judicial appointments in-
cluded the first woman Colorado Supreme 
Court Justice, Jean Dubofsky, and the first 
Hispanic Justice, Luis Rovira, who went on to 
become Chief Justice. In addition, Governor 
Lamm appointed women and people of color 
to his cabinet. He also successfully dem-
onstrated how a Democratic governor could 
work with a Republican legislature to further 
the interests of the state, including strength-
ening our state’s economy, maintaining a re-
sponsible budget, and protecting our citizens 
when natural disasters struck. 
Even after Governor Lamm’s final term, he 
never retired from the arena of public dis-
course. He held strong and frequently unpopu-
lar opinions, many of which were based on his 
lifelong concern about the future of our planet. 
Although his views were not the norm, he rel-
ished the public debate and never shied away 
from engaging in spirited policy discussions 
with friends and family, colleagues, members 
of the press, and his fellow Americans. I was 
privileged to engage in a number of those 
spirited discussions with him and, while we 
might not have agreed, I always came away 
learning something new. 
Dick Lamm had a spectacular career in the 
public arena, but he would argue that his most 
important treasure was his family. In 1963, he 
married Dottie Vennard. They forged an im-
portant partnership that redefined the role of 
political spouse. With Dick’s unwavering sup-
port, Dottie established herself as a strong 
feminist voice and gave a new definition to the 
term ‘‘first lady.’’ On the way, they parented 
two children, Heather and Scott. Their family 
bond is one of the strongest I have ever seen. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my deepest per-
sonal condolences to Dottie, Heather, Scott, 
and all of Dick Lamm’s family and friends. On 
a personal note, I was proud to count him as 
my friend and as a real mentor, modeling 
courage of conviction and hard work for future 
generations of political leaders. Dick will be re-
membered as the formidable figure he was 
who, in the critical development years of our 
state, shaped us for who we are today.

CONGRATULATING TOKYO 2020 SIL-
VER 
MEDALIST 
JESSICA 
PARRATTO 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Dover native Jessica Parratto 
on winning a silver medal in the women’s syn-
chronized 10-meter platform diving competition 
at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. It was 
an honor welcoming her home to Dover and 
seeing firsthand the pride her hometown feels 
for her. 
All the way from her days at the Seacoast 
Swimming Association to her time at the Uni-
versity of Indiana and, of course, in Tokyo, 
Jessica’s hard work and dedication have in-
spired so many others. I am deeply impressed 
by the skill, teamwork, and perseverance that 
she demonstrated alongside her teammate 
Delaney Schnell. 
Especially after the hardships of the past 
year, it is uplifting and inspiring for all Granite 
Staters to see Jessica make history as part of 
the first American pair to win an Olympic 
medal in women’s synchronized 10-meter plat-
form diving. 
On behalf of my constituents across New 
Hampshire’s First Congressional District, I 
would like to thank Jessica for representing 
our nation with true athletic excellence on the 
Olympic stage in Tokyo. We were proud to re-
cently welcome her home to Dover and extend 
our sincerest congratulations on her historic 
silver medal-winning performance. I hope she 
enjoys a well-deserved celebration of her 
achievements and wish her continued success 
in all her future endeavors. 
IN RECOGNITION OF BISHOP J. 
DREW SHEARD 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Burning Bush International Min-
istries, a house of worship located in Inkster, 
Michigan, as they host their Regathering event 
and to give welcome to Presiding Bishop J. 
Drew Sheard. 
Earlier this year, the Church of God in 
Christ General Assembly, the legislative body 
of the denomination, voted Bishop J. Drew 
Sheard of Detroit, Michigan as the leader of 
the worldwide organization, the largest Pente-
costal denomination in the country. This ac-
complishment is the culmination of many 
years of Bishop Sheard’s religious vocation in 
serving the spiritual needs of others. 
Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Bishop 
Sheard was called to the ministry at a young 
age. Over the years he has served in various 
roles both locally and nationally. His innate 
leadership called him to fulfill his vision to cre-
ate more meaningful connections and growth 
in the church, including the implementation of 
several youth-based programs and scholarship 
program. Bishop Sheard currently serves as a 
member of the Presidium of the Church of 
God in Christ, Jurisdictional Bishop of the 
Michigan-North Central Ecclesiastical Jurisdic-
tion, and as the Senior Pastor of Greater Em-
manuel Institutional Church of God in Christ in 
Detroit, Michigan. 
Please join me in welcoming Bishop J. Drew 
Sheard in celebration of this momentous gath-
ering at Burning Bush International Ministries.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOME 
RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the National Capital Planning Com-
mission District of Columbia Home Rule Act. 
This bill would remove the authority of the Na-
tional Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), a 
federal agency, to review or approve the de-
velopment of District of Columbia-owned land. 
This bill would also remove the requirement 
that the Mayor of the District get NCPC’s ap-
proval before selling D.C.-owned real estate, 
and would allow D.C. agencies to transfer ju-
risdiction over D.C.-owned land among them-
selves without NCPC’s approval. 
Under federal law, NCPC has approval au-
thority for the development of D.C.-owned 
public buildings located in the central area, in-
cluding the location, height, bulk, number of 
stories, and size of such buildings. The District 
is required to consult with NCPC on its build-
ings outside the central area, but NCPC has 
only advisory authority in those areas. The 
central area is defined by the concurrent ac-
tion of NCPC and the D.C. Council and cur-
rently consists of the Downtown and Shaw 
Urban Renewal Areas.

This authority is unnecessary, as shown by 
the virtual absence of its use to disapprove 
sales or development, and violates D.C. home 
rule. This latent authority of the federal gov-
ernment should not be able to slow or block 
the development of D.C.-owned land or add to 
the cost of development. The District is not a 
federal agency and should not be treated any 
differently by federal law than other local juris-
dictions, where local development proceeds 
without federal interference. 
This bill is one more important step to in-
crease home rule for the District, and I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill.

Maryland’s 7th Congressional District for 15 
consecutive years. 
From handling military service academy ap-
plication requests to working to obtain pass-
ports for people who were in emergency pre-
dicaments, Mrs. Malone has given effort 
above and beyond what could be expected of 
someone working in her capacity for a con-
gressional office. This is borne out through the 
many testimonials and kudos I have received 
from parents and high school counselors who 
have repeatedly applauded her extra caring 
for young people competitively attempting to 
be appointed to one of our nation’s military 
academies. 
Likewise, her empathy, care, and concern 
for new arrivals in America is exemplified by 
her excellent service to immigrants coming to 
Maryland. Whether refugee, asylum seeker or 
Special Immigration Visa applicant each per-
son, every family and local communities were 
connected to a person in Katie who wanted to 
transition people smoothly and seamlessly into 
our great and welcoming State of Maryland. 
As demonstrated by her care and affection 
for her husband, William Malone, and children 
Abigail, Jane, Jack, and Erin, it is obvious that 
Bill and Katie are giving parents who know 
and teach that all people matter regardless of 
their background or station in life. 
Working to improve the mail delivery and 
postal service options for everyone in the dis-
trict regardless of zip code is another effort 
Katie has undertaken. Seniors and service 
personnel who rely on the timely delivery of 
mail have particularly benefited from her ef-
forts. She handled special projects with spe-
cial care and always did it with a smile on her 
face. If you were to look up the term ‘‘con-
stituent service’’ in the dictionary, Katie 
Malone’s picture would be there. 
Since June of 2006 when the late Elijah 
Cummings hired her to work in his congres-
sional office Katie has toiled in the trenches. 
She has addressed constituent complaints in 
an effective and efficient yet friendly manner. 
Service to the public has been her hallmark. I 
have received numerous compliments about 
her work and the effort she gives to get things 
done for the people of my district. So, it is with 
heartfelt gratitude that I rise to recognize Mrs. 
Katie Malone for her dedication, hard work 
and public service to the benefit of all in the 
7th District, throughout Maryland and indeed 
for our Nation. 
May she continue to be a beacon of light in 
a sometimes-dark world of public engagement. 
We were fortunate to have worked with some-
one as enthusiastic, competent, and optimistic 
as Katie. May her future endeavors continue 
to touch people with the positivity that she has 
shown in her public service for both Elijah and 
myself in Maryland’s 7th Congressional Dis-
trict.

Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Dr. Jim Logan on 
being selected for induction into the Wyoming 
Agriculture Hall of Fame Class of 2021. 
Veterinarian Dr. Jim Logan has served live-
stock producers across the nation for many 
years in a multitude of capacities. Throughout 
his distinguished career, Jim has played a key 
role in developing animal disease regulations, 
providing common sense approaches to ani-
mal health issues, and above all, working with 
a true passion for agriculture. 
Jim attended the University of Wyoming in 
1969 and earned his Doctor of Veterinary 
Medicine from Colorado State University in 
1975. Shortly after graduating, he returned 
home to Riverton and opened his own veteri-
nary practice in 1981. 
Jim’s service to the livestock industry here 
in Wyoming did not stop at providing top qual-
ity care to animals. Jim served his community 
by staying active as well as taking on leader-
ship roles within the U.S. Animal Health Asso-
ciation, the American Veterinary Medical Asso-
ciation, Wyoming Veterinary Medical Associa-
tion, the Wyoming Livestock Board, American 
Sheep Industry Association, the National Ani-
mal Health Surveillance System Steering 
Committee, Wyoming Wool Growers Associa-
tion, and Western States Livestock Health As-
sociation. 
Our state has been truly blessed by Jim’s 
work within the Wyoming livestock industry. 
Through both his private veterinarian practice 
and serving as the Wyoming State Veteri-
narian, Jim has strengthened the agriculture 
and livestock industry here in Wyoming and 
across the Nation. 
I thank Jim for his dedication to Wyoming’s 
agriculture industry, and congratulate him on 
the well-deserved induction in the Hall of 
Fame.

HONORING DAN FLORES AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor retired Council Bluffs Police Officer Lt. 
Dan Flores as Iowan of the Week. Dan has 
lived in Council Bluffs since 1981 and has be-
come a staple in his community. Dan has 
committed himself to helping others through-
out his career with the Council Bluffs Police 
Department, through his work with Centro 
Latino advocacy, and during his continued 
service directing the Iowa Western Community 
College security force. 
Dan knew he wanted to join law enforce-
ment since middle school. He would go on to 
receive his Bachelor’s Degree from Minnesota 
State at Mankato after completing a 2-year de-
gree at North Iowa Community College. He 
was the first in his family to obtain a four-year 
degree. After his college graduation, he joined 
the Council Bluffs Police Department where he 
served for thirty-six years. During that time, 
Dan became a positive influence within the 
Police Department and the community at 
large. As a detective, Dan is proud to have 
worked on cases that made the community 
safer. Dan strengthened police programs such 
as the Chaplain Corp and the drug take-back 
program. 
In addition to his police service, Dan sought 
out another way to give back to his commu-
nity. In 2015, Dan joined the Board of Direc-
tors for Centro Latino in Council Bluffs, a non- 
profit organization focused on Hispanic/Latino 
community building. Dan was drawn to Centro 
Latino thinking about how his ancestors would 
have benefited from an organization like 
Centro Latino. During his time with the organi-
zation, Centro Latino has seen strong growth. 
With a larger operating budget and staff, 
Centro Latino continues to provide community 
resources for the Southwest Iowa Hispanic/ 
Latino community. Next month Centro Latino 
is looking forward to an open house at their 
learning center, and hosting Latino Festival 
2021 on September 25th. Dan is also looking 
forward to keeping up with Centro Latino’s fu-
ture successes. 
After retiring from the police department in 
2017, Dan looked for an opportunity to get in-
volved with Iowa Western Community College 
where several members of his family had at-
tended. He serves as Director of Safety and 
Security for the College, safeguarding the 
campus and students. His current involvement

with IWCC has additional meaning for Dan, as 
he took his police academy training at Iowa 
Western in 1982. Dan very much looks for-
ward to continuing to assist students as they 
continue their education in the fall and be-
yond. 
Dan’s commitment to others through his 
service and advocacy deserves special rec-
ognition. It is my pleasure to honor Dan Flores 
as Iowan of the Week.

RETIREMENT 
OF 
BERNARD 
A. 
‘‘BUD’’ 
BARTON, 
JR., 
THE 
LI-
BRARY OF CONGRESS CHIEF IN-
FORMATION OFFICER 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Bernard A. ‘‘Bud’’ Bar-
ton, Jr. on his retirement from the Library of 
Congress and to thank him for nearly three 
decades of dedicated public service. 
Mr. Barton has spent his career at the inter-
section of knowledge and technology. While 
serving as the deputy chief information officer 
for the North Carolina National Guard. Mr. 
Barton designed the agency’s disaster recov-
ery and continuity of operations capabilities, 
ensuring the Guard lived up to its ‘‘Always 
Ready’’ motto. As chief information officer for 
the Defense Technical Information Center, Mr. 
Barton ensured that the Department of De-
fense’s largest library had the IT infrastructure 
necessary to fuse science and technology 
data and reliably deliver the knowledge need-
ed to develop the next generation of tech-
nologies to support our Warfighters and help 
assure national security. 
In 2015, Mr. Barton took on what Fortune 
Magazine labeled as possibly the hardest job 
in tech, serving as the Chief Information Offi-
cer for the Library of Congress. Mr. Barton 
has ably guided the nation’s oldest federal cul-
tural institution through a complete techno-
logical overhaul. Mr. Barton oversaw the cen-
tralization of Library technology activities; fos-
tered the creation of an agency-wide digital 
strategy; and marshalled efforts to optimize 
and modernize the Library’s IT infrastructure 
and critical IT business systems. Under his 
leadership, the Library completed a three-year 
data center transformation, embracing the best 
of traditional IT services and the Cloud to en-
sure a stable, flexible, scalable foundation for 
the future. He also completely revamped IT 
security, and successfully addressed more 
than 100 major technology recommendations 
identified by Congress and the GAO. 
Through it all, Mr. Barton has been a trans-
parent, proactive, and enthusiastic partner to 
Members of Congress, our staff and our con-
stituents. 
The impact of these changes cannot be 
overstated. As the world’s largest library and 
home of both the Congressional Research 
Service and the U.S. Copyright Office, the Li-
brary of Congress stands as a beacon of 
knowledge and a source of creativity. Mr. Bar-
ton leaves the Library a stronger, more 
digitally enabled institution that is better pre-
pared than ever to serve the needs of Con-
gress, researchers, and all Americans. 
Please join me in wishing Mr. Barton a well- 
deserved retirement after a lifetime of faithful 
public service. 
2021 BUS TOUR 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I always look forward to the annual 
bus tour of South Carolina’s Second Congres-
sional District. Our bus tour began with a 
meeting with U of SC Aiken Chancellor Daniel 
Heimermann at the Savannah River National 
Laboratory led by Dr. Vahid Majidi and re-
gional academia partners. Then we headed to 
Woods Farm Market in Aiken, owned by Pam-
ela Johnson Ely, where new jobs have been 
developed. 
The next stop was the Aiken Rotary Club 
under the leadership of President Mallory 
Holley and then the Central States Manufac-
turing facility in Graniteville for a wonderful 
tour led by General Manager Rick Neely. Our 
team also stopped by Cavalier’s Coffee, a 
local small business just developed by David 
Brannon with plans to add jobs in North Au-
gusta. We ended our day at beautiful Aiken 
State Park hearing from the wonderful folks at 
South Carolina Parks, Recreation, and Tour-
ism hosted by Paul Mcformack, Joy Raintree, 
Aaron Chavous, James Studdarb, Samantha 
Queen, Justin Hancock, Steve Beckham, Mary 
Ann Keisler, and Mark van der Linden. 
Day two began with a townhall hosted by 
the Irmo Chamber of Commerce, which is ca-
pably led by Kerry Powers. I appreciated the 
chance for open and honest conversations 
about issues currently facing our country. 
Then, the team received a tour of the new 
Piney Woods Elementary School in Chapin 
under the leadership of Principal Cassy Pas-
chal. We also toured the state-of-the-art UPS 
Air Hub facility at Columbia Metropolitan Air-
port in West Columbia with Kim Barbery. She 
is the Operations Training Manager of an im-
pressive facility with great staff producing over 
2,000 jobs. I was grateful to co-author with 
State Senator Kay Patterson the legislation to 
incentivize UPS to locate in Lexington County. 
Day three started with a tour of the beautiful 
Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, 
greeted by President and CEO Tommy 
Stringfellow. Next, we stopped at TerraStride 
and met with Founder and CEO Lanford Hollo-
way, whose leadership has made TerraStride 
one of the fastest growing tech companies in 
South Carolina. Afterwards was a visit to Fort 
Jackson for a briefing on the Army Combat 
Fitness Test, led by Brigadier General Patrick 
R. Michaelis. We ended day three with a visit 
to 
Thermal 
Technologies 
in 
Blythewood, 
where founder Jim Lentz has revolutionized 
the fruit ripening industry, particularly for ba-
nanas. 
On the final day of the bus tour, I stopped 
at the world-class Government Training Insti-
tute in Barnwell, led by President Von Bolin. 
Then, we made our way to Tommy Shealy’s 
restaurant, Shealy’s Bar-B-Que, a tradition 
that I look forward to every year. Our bus tour 
concluded with a warm welcome from Orange-
burg Mayor Pro-Tem Liz Zimmerman Keitt, 
and a tour of the new Orangeburg VA Clinic 
and adjacent Orangeburg Recreation Center. 
It was inspiring to see the great work by 
Gregg Robinson and his team at Orangeburg 
County Development Commission to attract 
new business to South Carolina. The legisla-
tive achievements of Senator TIM SCOTT, with 
President Donald Trump, has led to building 
opportunity zones specifically designed to cre-
ate jobs. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we 
will never forget September the 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism.

HONORING DR. BLANCA CAVAZOS 
AS 
SUPERINTENDENT 
OF 
THE 
TAFT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DIS-
TRICT 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Blanca Cavazos after near-
ly four decades of public service to our com-
munity. Blanca is stepping down as the Super-
intendent of the Taft Union High School Dis-
trict after dedicating 39 years of combined 
service to the Kern High School District, Kern 
County Superintendent of Schools, and most 
recently, the Taft Union High School District. 
Blanca’s life exemplifies what it means to 
achieve the American Dream. Born in Mexico 
to farmworker parents, Blanca’s family moved 
to Arvin, California when she was three years 
old. After graduating high school, Blanca en-
rolled in California State University, Bakers-
field (CSUB), where she earned her bachelor’s 
degree in Liberal Studies and earned two 
master’s degrees: one in Bilingual Cross-Cul-
tural Education and one in Educational Admin-
istration. 
In 1997, Blanca served Arvin High School— 
her alma mater—as the school’s first woman 
and minority principal, beginning her career as 
a trailblazer in the field of education. She led 
the school to great success by doubling the 
number of Advanced Placement courses of-
fered to students, building up the school’s We 
the People civics education program, and pro-
viding educational trainings to parents on high 
school graduation requirements and the col-
lege application process. In 2011, she brought 
her talent to bear to the Task Force Adminis-
trator position at the Kern High School District 
and later as the Chief Instructional Officer for 
the Kern County Superintendent of Schools. In 
2013, she received her doctorate in education 
from Fresno State University and was ap-
pointed to the role of Superintendent of the 
Taft Union High School District, where she 
has selflessly served over the past eight years 
as the district’s first woman superintendent. 
Throughout her life, Blanca has broken 
many barriers and gone above and beyond for 
her students, colleagues, and community. Ba-
kersfield Life Magazine showcased her service 
in multiple editions, including ‘‘Ladies Who 
Lead Schools’’ and ‘‘Thirteen People to 
Watch.’’ In addition to her work, Blanca has 
spent time serving on the Finance Committee, 
Audit Committee, and State Board of Directors 
for the Association of California School Admin-
istrators. In 2019, she received the Adminis-
trator of the Year Award from the Association 
of California School Administrators and in 
2020, she was inducted to the CSUB Alumni 
Hall of Fame. 
Blanca’s commitment to our community is 
undeniable. She has touched the lives of 
many, watching her students grow into the

be greatly missed, I am confident that her 
record of service will continue to impact the 
people of Taft and the rest of Kern County for 
years to come. On behalf of the people of the 
23rd Congressional District of California, I 
want to thank Blanca for her steadfast service 
to our community, and I wish her and her fam-
ily only the best as she embarks on the next 
chapter in her life.

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate Ms. Mary Futch, a

Ms. Futch was born and raised in Kos-
ciusko, Mississippi, but she is proud to call 
Detroit her home. In fact, she has lived at the 
same address on Maxwell Street for more 
than sixty years. Married to the late Ollie 
Futch, Ms. Futch was a devoted wife and 
mother of ten children. Ms. Futch, or Momma 
Futch, is well-known in her neighborhood and 
church community at Mt. Zion Missionary Bap-
tist Church. 
Please join me in wishing Momma Futch the 
happiest of birthdays, surrounded by love and 
warm wishes of her family and friends.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
PRO-
TECTING 
INDEPENDENT 
CON-
TRACTORS 
FROM 
DISCRIMINA-
TION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Protecting Independent Contrac-
tors from Discrimination Act, which would ex-
tend to independent contractors the same fed-
eral antidiscrimination protections enjoyed by 
employees. My bill would extend the following 
antidiscrimination statutes, which apply to em-
ployees, to independent contractors: Title VII 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act of 1967, Title I 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 
505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title 
II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination 
Act of 2008. 
In a Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005 anal-
ysis of the American workforce, approximately 
seven percent of workers were considered 
independent contractors. That number has 
surely only grown in the 16 years since that 
analysis with the growth of the so-called gig 
economy. A more recent poll estimates the 
number at 14 percent. Independent contrac-
tors, who often do the same work as employ-
ees, have almost none of the same protec-
tions, including health insurance, collective 
bargaining, retirement security, and even anti-
discrimination. My bill focuses only on dis-
crimination, such as discrimination based on 
race, age, and gender, from which every work-
er is entitled to be free. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

HONORING KEITH HAMILTON ON 
BEING 
SELECTED

INDUC-
TION INTO THE WYOMING AGRI-
CULTURE HALL OF FAME 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Keith Hamilton on 
being selected for induction into the Wyoming 
Agriculture Hall of Fame Class of 2021. 
Keith grew up as the fourth generation on 
the Hamilton Ranch. His family’s long-standing 
roots in the agricultural industry gave him a 
vast knowledge of our state’s unique ranching 
traditions. Keith used this information to ben-
efit his community by working to conserve nat-
ural resources important to our western life-
style. Over the course of his career, Keith has 
been recognized as a strong voice for the ag-
riculture industry and quickly became a role 
model for aspiring young ranchers. 
In 1975, Keith joined the Wyoming Farm 
Bureau and began taking on leadership posi-
tions. In 1981, he became the Big Horn Coun-
ty Farm Bureau Vice President. In 1988, Keith 
joined the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation 
Board of Directors and represented Big Horn, 
Fremont, Hot Springs, Park, and Washakie 
counties as the Northwest District Director 
until 2010. He also serves on the American 
Farm Bureau’s Public Lands working com-
mittee. 
Keith has been very active in serving on 
other boards including the Wyoming State 
Grazing Board, Wyoming Wool Growers, Wyo-
ming Stockgrowers. wildlife working groups, 
and his local school board. Through his serv-
ice, Keith has shown his genuine passion and 
dedication to giving back to his community 
and the agriculture industry. 
Keith works from sunup to sundown with a 
smile on his face, a quick wit, and a joy that 
emulates from within. Through his commitment 
to his community, neighbors, and friends, 
Keith has become a great example of the type 
of rancher Wyoming needs. 
I thank Keith for his tireless efforts to pro-
mote agriculture and for his service to our 
state. Congratulations to him on his well-de-
served induction into the Hall of Fame.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
CHIEF JEFF S. HELMS 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding service of Jeff S. 
Helms, a beloved community leader and Po-
lice Chief of the Fort Mill Police Department. 
Chief Helms has dedicated nearly four dec-
ades of his life to protecting our community. In 
1983, upon the incorporation of the city of 
Tega Cay, Chief Helms was one of the first 
patrolmen hired to serve the city. He went on 
to serve the York County Sheriff’s Department, 
primarily working as a detective dealing with 
armed robberies and homicides. 
In 1994, Chief Helms was hired as the Po-
lice Chief of the Town of Fort Mill. Hired at the 
early age of 31, Chief Helms was the young-
est and longest serving Police Chief in Fort 
Mill History. When he was first hired, Fort 
Mill’s population was around 3,500 and the 
department only had 11 officers, 5 patrol cars, 
and one computer. Chief Helms has built a 
department of highly qualified officers and em-
ployees who selflessly serve the town with 
dedication and pride. During his tenure, the 
department has grown to 61 officers and 71 
total employees who serve a town of approxi-
mately 25,000 people. Throughout this time of 
unprecedented growth, Chief Helms and the 
officers of the Fort Mill Police Department 
have helped the town consistently rank in the 
top 9 safest cities in South Carolina. ln the 
words of incoming Fort Mill Police Chief Bryan 
Zachary, ‘‘Chief Helms leaves large shoes to 
fill.’’ 
Throughout his 27 years of unparalleled 
leadership at the Fort Mill Police Department, 
Chief Helms has been recognized with numer-
ous awards and honors. He was voted Police 
Officer of the Year by Fort Mill Times and was 
honored with the Local Hero Award by the 
Fort Mill Optimist Club, among other awards. 
He is also recognized as a founding member 
of the York County Multijurisdictional Drug En-
forcement Unit. Created in the early years of 
his tenure as Chief, this was a groundbreaking 
and highly successful collaboration between 
departments that has been used as a model 
for other departments in South Carolina and 
around the Nation. 
The career of Chief Helms is a testament to 
all the good our men and women in blue do 
for our communities. He leaves behind a leg-
acy of progress and success. On behalf of the 
5th District of South Carolina, I thank Chief 
Helms for his service and wish him a happy 
retirement. Fort Mill has been truly blessed to 
have him as a community guardian for the last 
27 years.

wife, Kimberly, his five children, Ell Jr., 
Kimelle, 
Joshua, 
Maurice, 
LaMiyah 
and 
Daviyon, and his grandchildren, Ariell Jr. and 
Ell Edward Ash III. 
A man of large stature and spirit, Ell’s pres-
ence was one that welcomed you and that 
could not be ignored. You could often find Ell 
behind his grill at community events preparing 
his famous barbeque or energizing the con-
gregation at Mt. Zion AME Church by playing 
Gospel Jazz or R&B on his saxophone. He 
was an individual that enjoyed challenging the 
younger men in his life to keep up with him; 
especially when it came to football, swimming, 
and bike riding. 
Anyone who knows Ell will speak to his pas-
sion for service and this is shown no clearer 
than in his commitment toward youth men-
toring. From his days at the University of 
Houston, he was an active leader in the 
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity’s ‘‘Guide Right’’ 
program, a hands-on curriculum that empow-
ers youth in the Black community to harness 
their potential to address local issues. For 25 
years, Ell served as a Senior Corrections Offi-
cer at the Garden State Youth Correctional 
Facility. Throughout any week, you could find 
Ell coaching football, baseball, and basketball 
teams 
throughout 
the

RECOGNIZING REVEREND ROBERT 
DIMLICH’S 90TH BIRTHDAY AND 
HIS SERVICE TO OUR COMMU-
NITY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am privi-
leged to recognize Reverend Robert Dimlich 
upon the occasion of his 90th Birthday, and 
his ongoing ministries as a pastor, both at 
home and abroad. 
After completing his studies at Washington 
Bible College in 1972, earning a Bachelor’s 
Degree in Pastoral Theology, Rev. Dimlich 
pastored four churches from Shrewsbury, 
Massachusetts (1973 to 1976) to Charlestown, 
New Hampshire (1976 to 2002). He took his 
family to Stuttgart, Germany for six and a half 
years to pastor the Bible Church, at which he 
ministered to an English-speaking congrega-
tion of U.S. Service Members, government 
contractors, and families who were associated 
with the four U.S. military installations in the 
area. 
Now residing in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 
Rev. Dimlich is the interim Pastor of the 
Bressler Bible Church, where he’s served for 
nearly six years. 
Rev. Dimlich also maintains a ministry of let-
ter writing to reach individuals facing chal-
lenges, to include prison outreach. He aims to 
instill the Spirit of God to the incarcerated, 
while equipping them with the tools necessary 
to live a more productive and God-fearing way 
of life as they return to society. 
Rev. Dimlich’s ministry has been marked 
with a desire to meet the needs of others, with 
a heart of humility. He seeks to bring no fame, 
fortune, or honor to himself, but simply to re-
flect the mind of Christ by obeying His Heav-
enly Father’s will. 
I am honored to commend Reverend Robert 
Dimlich on his many successes in commu-
nities in and outside of our Nation, and his life-
long commitment to the Church. I wish him all 
of God’s blessings as he celebrates his 90th 
Birthday, and wish him many more happy, 
healthy, and faithful adventures in days to 
come.

PRAISING 
PRESIDENT 
WILLIAM 
JEFFERSON 
CLINTON’S 
VISION-
ARY LEADERSHIP 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, last 
week I rose to highlight and discuss the major 
reasons why Americans are so appreciative 
that Bill Clinton served as the 42nd President 
of the United States, especially for his healing 
words and actions during the time of the tragic 
and horrific April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing 
at the Edmund R. Murrah Federal Building 
that killed 168 persons, including 19 children, 
and wounded more than 800 others. 
I added that we Democrats thank President 
Clinton for all that, but for so much more, a 
subject I wish to elaborate on today. 
Bill Clinton was the unparalleled visionary 
Democratic political leader of the latter half of 
the 20th Century. 
In the presidential election preceding his, 
the Democratic candidate was beaten in the 
Electoral College 426–112, losing 40 states, 
and trailing in the popular vote by 7.8 percent-
age points and 7 million votes. 
In the presidential election before that, 
1984, the Democratic candidate lost 49 of 50 
states, lost the Electoral College 525–13, and 
lost the popular vote by 18.2 percentage 
points and 16.8 million votes. 
The 1992 electoral map and political outlook 
were bleak for the Governor of the ‘small 
southern state of Arkansas’ but he would not 
be deterred and would not be outworked and 
did not waver in his conviction that his pro-
gressive policies promising shared prosperity 
and his inclusive vision in which the United 
States ‘‘did not have a person to waste’’ would 
attract majority support. 
The happy result of the 1992 presidential 
election is that the Democratic candidate, Bill 
Clinton, won the Electoral College 370–168, 
won 30 states, won every region of the coun-
try except the Deep South, won the popular 
vote by 5.6 percentage points 5.8 million 
votes, carrying several states that had not 
voted Democratic or voted Democratic only 
once since 1964, including California, Pennsyl-
vania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Jer-
sey, New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, 
Montana, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and 
Kentucky. 
President Clinton repeated the feat in 1996, 
becoming the first Democratic President to win 
reelection since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944, 
carrying 31 states and the District of Colum-
bia, prevailing in the Electoral College 379– 
159, and winning the popular vote by 8.2 mil-
lion votes and 8.51 percentage points, and be-
came the first Democrat to carry the states of 
Florida and Arizona since 1976 and 1948, re-
spectively. 
And he carried the suburban vote, which for 
the first time in history comprised the largest 
percentage of the electorate, gave us a mas-
ter class in how a candidate for national office 
should speak and appeal to moms and dads 
with financial anxieties, growing kids about 
whose educational and economic futures they 
are concerned, and worried for their safety of 
their communities and the health security of 
their aging parents. 
A legendary political campaigner second to 
none ever, Bill Clinton shattered what used to 
be called the ‘GOP Electoral Lock’ and built 
the famed ‘Blue Wall,’ which every Democratic 
candidate since has relied upon for victory and 
that has made the Democratic candidate the 
popular vote winner in seven out of the last 
eight presidential elections. 
Not only that, because of President Clinton’s 
extraordinary success in managing the affairs 
of our nation, Republican charges now ring 
hollow when they shout that Democrats ‘‘are 
soft on crime,’’ ‘‘unwilling to defend the coun-
try,’’ ‘‘favor welfare recipients over hard work-
ing Americans,’’ relegating them to invent new 
bogeymen like ‘‘Radical Islamic Terrorism’’ 
and ‘‘Caravans of Illegal Aliens’’ and ‘‘Chinese 
Communists’’ at our doorstep, invoke ‘‘family 
values,’’ ‘‘guns, God, or gays,’’ or some other 
culture war shibboleth, or to spout nonsensical 
conspiracy theories like the Big Lie that the 
2020 presidential election was stolen and rife 
with fraud. 
Truth be told, Madam Speaker, the real 
problem with our friends in the Republican 
Party is that they have never adapted to the 
Age of Clinton, in which politics and govern-
ance is about meeting people where they live 
and giving them the tools and opportunities 
they need to make the most of their own lives, 
and treating all persons fairly and with respect, 
and above all, not rationing justice. 
This is why they have been unable to com-
mand majority or plurality support in all but 
one of the last eight national elections. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Alexis 
DeTocqueville 
came to visit America 190 years ago to study 
the maiden case of democracy in action and 
here is what he wrote about political parties; it 
remains surprisingly relevant and prescient: 
‘‘[S]mall parties are generally without po-
litical faith. As they are not elevated and 
sustained by lofty purposes, the selfishness 
of their character is openly displayed in all 
their actions. They glow with a factious zeal; 
their language is violent, but their progress 
is timid and uncertain. The means they em-
ploy are as disreputable as the aim sought.’’ 
What distinguishes the Democratic Party 
from the Republican Party is the former’s abid-
ing faith in the capacity of human beings to 
improve their social, economic, and political 
conditions. 
On the other hand, at the core of the Re-
publican philosophy lies a darker, more pessi-
mistic view of this ‘‘scope of human perfect-
ibility’’; instead of looking to the future with 
courage and optimism, the conservative spirit 
looks to a nostalgic past with a pessimistic at-
titude toward a dreaded future. 
Madam Speaker, because of the remarkable 
leadership and success role-modeled by the 
President William Jefferson Clinton, Demo-
crats in Congress and across the nation know

who they are, what they believe, and what is 
important to fight to achieve or preserve; 
maybe one day our friends across the aisle 
will be so lucky. 
I thank President Clinton for all he did as 
the Nation’s 42nd President and captain of the 
ship of state to make our Nation the most 
prosperous on earth and at peace in the 
world.

HONORING THE LIFE AND EXEM-
PLARY LEGACY OF STATE REP-
RESENTATIVE 
THAD 
C. 
MCCLAMMY, JR. 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life and legacy of Alabama 
State Representative, Thad McClammy, an 
exemplary community advocate, public serv-
ant, and former president of Trenholm State 
Community College who passed away at age 
78 on August 21, 2021, of natural causes sur-
rounded by family. 
Representative McClammy, one of three 
siblings, was born in Beatrice, Alabama, to 
Ukla and Thad C. McClammy, Sr. A graduate 
of Alabama State University, Rep. McClammy 
earned his Master of Science in Vocational 
and Adult Education from Auburn University at 
Montgomery. He also received an Honorary 
Doctorate of Law degree from Selma Univer-
sity. 
In 1981, prior to his career as an elected of-
ficial, Rep. McClammy served as President of 
Trenholm 
State 
Technical 
College, 
now 
Trenholm Community College, for fourteen 
years. During his tenure, he conceptualized 
and successfully spearheaded a concerted ef-
fort by five two-year colleges in Alabama, in-
cluding Trenholm, to receive Congressional 
delegation as Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities. By working to secure this des-
ignation, he made way for millions of dollars in 
federal funds year after year to Alabama. 
Under his leadership, Trenholm State became 
a catalyst for community revitalization, piloting 
a new Certification of Participation program to 
fund the construction of the college’s library. 
After seeing its success, many other Alabama 
two-year colleges used this approach to fi-
nance new construction. 
Rep. McClammy served in the Alabama 
House of Representatives for nearly twenty- 
seven years, beginning his career as an elect-
ed official in 1994. Representing Alabama’s 
76th District, Rep. McClammy dutifully served 
his community using his position to further the 
economic development of both his district and 
the greater Montgomery area. Capitalizing on 
his position as a community leader, he was re-
sponsible for identifying the site and working 
with the landowners to get them to band to-
gether to make way for the construction of 
Hyundai’s one-billion-dollar plant in Mont-
gomery despite other sites being further along 
in consideration. He conceptualized the Gate-
way Recreational Park site on I–65 in Mont-
gomery, the initial Montgomery Enterprise 
Zone, and the I–65/Regional Airport Business 
Park in Montgomery. Continuously pushing for 
the expansion of U.S. 80 and 82, Rep. 
McClammy left his mark by working hand in 
hand with the local delegation and the com-
munity to secure the economic vitality of Ala-
bama’s 76th District. 
Continuing to address the needs of the 
community, Rep. McClammy helped recruit 
the Baptist Outreach Health Center, the Uni-
versity of Alabama at Birmingham Medical 
School branch campus site at Baptist South, 
advocated the correction of Cloverdale Ditch 
flood insurance problem, and successfully 
challenged the lack of minority representation 
in Montgomery. Forging symbiotic relation-
ships among the business community, Rep. 
McClammy helped bolster economic develop-
ment in Montgomery that led to over $70 mil-
lion worth of construction projects in West 
Montgomery. 
Understanding the importance of historical 
preservation throughout his district, Rep. 
McClammy was a fierce supporter and advo-
cate of Civil Rights preservation projects pro-
moting the establishment of the Interpretive 
Center on the campus of Alabama State Uni-
versity to be managed by National Park Serv-
ice, the planning and development of the 
Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights Trail and 
obtaining funding for the preservation of Mrs. 
Rosa Parks’ childhood school to name a few. 
He also sponsored the bill leading to the pas-
sage of the Rosa Parks’ Act that pardoned 
Mrs. Parks and hundreds of other convicted of 
violating laws aimed at keeping the races sep-
arate. 
As a dynamic community leader, Rep. 
McClammy also worked as a real estate 
broker and developer. His civil engagements 
include Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., the 
Cosmopolitan Civic Club, as a founder of the 
Montgomery Chamber of Commerce., and 
former deacon of The Historic Day Street Mis-
sionary Baptist Church. 
Rep. McClammy was preceded in death by 
his wife, Patricia A. McClammy, whom he 
married in 1966. Together they had two chil-
dren, Thad Christopher McClammy III and 
Patrice McClammy. He is survived by his chil-
dren and a host of other family members. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary life and legacy of 
Representative Thad McClammy and his con-
tributions to Alabama’s 76th District and the 
Montgomery community.

REMEMBERING WILLIAM J. ‘‘BILL’’ 
BOARMAN, 26TH PUBLIC PRINTER 
OF THE UNITED STATES 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great friend of the 
U.S. Government Publishing Office and of the 
U.S. Congress itself, former Public Printer Wil-
liam J. ‘‘Bill’’ Boarman, who passed away on 
August 22, 2021. 
Appointed by President Barack Obama, Bill 
served as the 26th Public Printer of the United 
States, the former title for the head of the U.S. 
Government Printing Office, as it was then 
known. As Rep. STENY HOYER has said, Bill’s 
service set a new standard of achievement for 
his successors to emulate. 
Bill’s arrival at GPO found the agency con-
fronting worrisome fiscal and technology chal-
lenges. He moved quickly to cut agency 
spending and aggressively collected funds 
owed to GPO throughout the government. In 
committee hearings and visits with Members 
of Congress, Bill provided persuasive testi-
mony on the value of the services that GPO 
performs while at the same time ordering the 
first-ever survey of Congress’s printing re-
quirements, resulting in the largest single-year 
reduction in the number of printed CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD copies delivered to Congress 
since GPO began an online version in 1994. 
Bill made customer service GPO’s primary 
strategic goal, a direction that earned the 
agency applause throughout the government. 
He ordered the development and release of 
GPO’s first mobile web application. He de-
vised and won congressional approval for a 
new investment and spending plan that put 
GPO on the path it is continuing to follow 
today. As a former GPO compositor, his return 
to the agency restored confidence and bol-
stered employee morale. While heralding tech-
nology change at GPO he appeared in ‘‘Lino-
type: The Film,’’ an independent production 
extolling the virtues of that long gone machine. 
Under his watch GPO observed its 150th anni-
versary, opening an exhibit of its history to the 
public and issuing an official history with a 
foreword by Bill. In addition to leaving the 
agency better than he found it, Bill made GPO 
history by appointing Ms. Davita Vance-Cooks 
as deputy public printer, the first woman ever 
to hold that post, and in 2013 the Senate con-
firmed her appointment to become the first 
woman and the first African American ever to 
head the agency. 
The road to Bill’s success at the GPO was 
paved from the beginning of his career. Bill 
spent his life in printing, frequently claiming 
that he had ‘‘ink in my veins,’’ and in his work 
supporting the rights and welfare of printers 
nationwide. Following high school in Hyatts-
ville, MD, he took a four-year apprenticeship 
with the International Typographical Union 
(ITU) and became a journeyman printer at 
McArdle Printing in Washington, D.C. In 1974, 
Bill began his career as a proofreader at the 
GPO and eventually moved up to linotype op-
erator. He quickly became a shop steward and 
at age 30 was elected president of the Colum-
bia Typographical Union, Local 101, his home 
local and a craft union that traces its begin-
ning to before the Civil War. 
Bill served on the ITU executive board in 
1987 where he was a key player in that orga-
nization’s merger with the Communication 
Workers of America. He was elected to head 
the ITU as it moved to merger, and he subse-
quently became head of the CWA’s Printing 
Sector. 
As the chief executive of the newly-merged 
organization, Bill oversaw bargaining and or-
ganizing in the printing industry. He also 
served as chair of the $1 billion CWA/ITU Ne-
gotiated Pension Plan and the $125 million 
counterpart serving Canadian printers. His ex-
perience with pension investing, funding, and 
administration led to his appointment to a 
number of high-level pension policy councils. 
Over the span of his career, Bill was a 
fierce advocate for workers’ rights. He was fre-
quently in attendance at labor rallies across 
the country, marching with Cesar Chavez in 
San Diego in 1990 and supporting Richard 
Trumka at the Detroit News Building during its

newspaper strike in 1996. His advocacy for 
workers was especially focused on GPO. For 
more than 40 years Bill advocated strongly 
and tirelessly for the agency, defending its es-
sential role and the role played by its employ-
ees in supporting Congress and the Federal 
Government. His advice and counsel were 
sought and welcomed by Members of Con-
gress on both sides of the aisle, as well as 
Presidents. 
After his retirement from GPO in 2012, Bill 
remained committed to public service. He was 
appointed by Maryland’s governor to serve on 
both the Maryland Commission on Judicial 
Disabilities and the Anne Arundel Board of 
Elections. He was an avid boater who loved 
his home port on the Severn River and en-
joyed the beauty of the Chesapeake Bay. He 
had a keen understanding of American history 
and thrived on lively political discussions. He 
loved sports, especially University of Maryland 
basketball and the Washington Football Team. 
In Bill Boarman, American printers nation-
wide had a true friend; the Congress, an hon-
orable and skillful servant; GPO, a champion 
whose impact continues to be felt. I ask my 
fellow Members of the House to join me in ex-
tending our deepest condolences to Bill’s fam-
ily and friends, as well as the thanks of a 
grateful nation for his dedicated service.

RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL 
OVERDOSE AWARENESS DAY 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, today I recog-
nize International Overdose Awareness Day. 
I speak not only as a Congressman, but as 
a father and husband who is working towards 
an end to overdose deaths and the heartache 
for the families and loved ones left behind. 
To those who have a loved one struggling 
with a substance abuse disorder or who have 
lost a loved one to an overdose, I am sorry, 
and I share in the collective grief. 
Like many in my home state of Arkansas 
and across the nation, my family and I have 
lost friends to overdoses. 
I am listening and I understand the pain that 
you and your loved ones have experienced in 
losing someone to an overdose. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I have 
worked to combat the opioid crisis, end over-
dose deaths, and end the stigma of overdose 
deaths and addiction. 
I was the co-author of the bipartisan 
Fentanyl Sanctions Act, and I am proud that it 
was signed into law in December 2019 as part 
of the National Defense Authorization Act. 
This law placed sanctions on drug manufac-
turers in China who knowingly provide syn-
thetic opioids to traffickers, and it placed sanc-
tions on transnational criminal organizations 
like those in Mexico who mix fentanyl with 
other drugs and traffic them into the United 
States. 
And, importantly, it placed sanctions on fi-
nancial institutions assisting those entities and 
individuals 
knowingly 
trafficking 
synthetic 
opioids. 
Stopping the flow of fentanyl and synthetic 
opioids is critical to preventing addiction and 
overdoses, and through it we will save lives. 
I appreciate the opportunity to mark Inter-
national Overdose Awareness Day and thank 
the organizers of the event, the Parker Gill 
Foundation, in Little Rock that is bringing to-
gether loved ones and that continues this im-
portant fight in the memory of those lost. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to continue this fight.

HONORING LINDA HAMILTON ON 
BEING 
SELECTED 
FOR 
INDUC-
TION INTO THE WYOMING AGRI-
CULTURE HALL OF FAME 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Linda Hamilton on 
being selected for induction into the Wyoming 
Agriculture Hall of Fame Class of 2021. 
Linda grew up on a ranch in the Sandhills 
of Nebraska and attended college at North-
west College in Powell and later, the Univer-
sity of Wyoming. Linda has long been a leader 
in her community and in the field of agriculture 
in Wyoming. Through Linda’s willingness to 
share her extensive knowledge of the agri-
culture industry, she has become known as a 
spearhead and a trusted adviser within our 
local community and other agricultural commu-
nities throughout the state. 
Linda has dedicated her time and efforts to 
many events and organizations within the 
Hyattville community, as well as serving as a 
founding member of Wyoming Agriculture in 
the Classroom. Through her activism, Linda 
was able to further the work of the Wyoming 
Association of Conservation District to assist 
farmers and ranchers in improving their oper-
ations while also protecting soil, water, plant, 
and wildlife resources. 
You can find Linda feeding bum lambs, driv-
ing equipment, wrangling grandchildren, sew-
ing or completing any task that needs to be 
done on the ranch or within the community on 
a regular basis. Linda’s devotion to the ranch, 
her family, and the agriculture industry is un-
matched. Wyoming is fortunate that Linda 
chose to move here from Nebraska all those 
many years ago. Linda possesses a drive and 
tenacity that is truly unmatched. You will not 
find anyone as dedicated to the promotion of 
local agriculture and the ranching way of life. 
I thank Linda for her dedication to Wyo-
ming’s agriculture industry, and congratula-
tions to her on the well-deserved induction into 
the Hall of Fame.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF DOC DUGAN 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember one of my constituents, Mr. 
Ferdinand ‘‘Doc’’ Dugan, III of Hague, Virginia. 
Mr. Dugan passed away on Sunday, August 
15, 2021 at the age of 88. Mr. Dugan was 
born in Catonsville, Maryland, and completed 
his undergraduate degree at the U.S. Naval 
Academy. 
Dugan honored his country with lifelong 
service, first with the United States Navy, and 
then in business. After retirement, Mr. Dugan 
went on to open an art gallery, where he sold 
original artwork and provided custom framing 
in the Northern Neck. 
In addition to a life of leadership in the mili-
tary and active participation in local politics, 
Mr. Dugan was known as a family man and a 
valuable member of the community. Along 
with his wife, Bobbie Dugan, together they 
have nine children, twenty-eight grandchildren, 
and five great-grandchildren. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask you to 
join me in honoring the life of Doc Dugan and 
applauding his contributions to Westmoreland 
County and the Commonwealth. On behalf of 
America’s First District, we say thank you to 
Doc Dugan.

REMEMBERING JIMMIE MUN˜ OZ, 
SR. 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Jimmie 
Mun˜oz, Sr., who passed away on August 16 
due to complications from COVID–19. Jimmie 
was a longtime south Phoenix community 
leader whom I had the honor of knowing. 
Jimmie was the son of Mexican immigrants 
who grew up in the former Golden Gate barrio 
in Phoenix and took great pride in where he 
came from. He served in the U.S. Army for six 
years, during which he met and married his 
wife, Norma. After retiring from the Army, 
Jimmie returned to Arizona, where throughout 
the course of his life he started several dif-
ferent businesses including a ranch, a tele-
communications business, and a local hangout 
called The Batters Cage. 
For Jimmie, family and community always 
came first, which is why he and Norma helped 
start the South Mountain Youth Development 
Association and organized an annual Cinco de 
Mayo festival. As part of his commitment to 
his community, Jimmie was elected constable 
of the South Mountain Justice Court in 1998. 
This was a difficult and sometime dangerous 
job that Jimmie conducted with compassion 
and dedication until his retirement in 2017. 
Jimmie was a truly kind man whose spirit 
will be greatly missed in the south Phoenix 
community. My thoughts are with his family 
during this difficult time.
