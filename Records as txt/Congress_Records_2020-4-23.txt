PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God, thank You for giving 
us another day. Send Your spirit of 
peace and comity among the Members 
of the people’s House. These are days of 
great political, social, and economic 
stress in our Nation, and those whose 
work is to legislate through this pan-
demic are naturally under considerable 
pressure. Give us all patience, espe-
cially with one another. 
May all our citizens, in the midst of 
great turmoil, be filled with gratitude 
for those in our Nation whose work 
must go on when it would be so easy 
not to assume their responsibility to 
do so. Continue to bless those whose 
life’s work is in service to public safe-
ty, be it police, medical professionals, 
or those producing and delivering our 
daily necessities. 
May everything done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

PROVIDING FOR ADOPTION OF H. 
RES. 935, ESTABLISHING A SE-
LECT 
SUBCOMMITTEE 
ON 
THE 
CORONAVIRUS CRISIS 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 938 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 938 
Resolved, That House Resolution 935 is 
hereby adopted. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the 
distinguished ranking member of the 
Rules Committee, pending which I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. During consideration of this res-
olution, all time yielded is for the pur-
pose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
before we get into the resolution before 
us, I want to speak to my colleagues 
about an important issue. 
Over the last several weeks, I have 
heard from Democrats and Repub-
licans, who have expressed concern 
that we, as a House, are not adequately 
prepared to do our business during a 
pandemic. They are right. 
Over a month ago, I prepared a report 
that I sent to everyone in the House— 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans—about 
possible ways that we could operate re-
motely. I received constructive feed-
back from both sides of the aisle, and 
this week I released text of a proposal 
that I hoped could have been voted on 
today. 
The Republican leader had some ob-
jections to that proposal, and our 
Speaker has agreed to continue the 
conversation for 2 more weeks. I have 
always believed that, whenever pos-
sible, any changes to our rules should 
be bipartisan, and I still believe that. 
However, the status quo, in my opin-
ion, is unacceptable and dangerous. I 
am not talking about to Members of 
Congress; more importantly, it is dan-
gerous to everyone we come in contact 
with. 
The year is 2020. Technology has ad-
vanced and improved considerably over 
the last 231 years. And, yes, there are 
problems with some of the technology

that exists out there, but there are 
low-tech approaches to dealing with re-
mote participation by our Members, 
and there are higher-tech ways to deal 
with it. And we can work that out. 
There are smart people in this Con-
gress who can figure all of this out. But 
I believe both sides of the aisle need to 
have some urgency in addressing this 
issue, especially in light of the state-
ments by the head of the CDC and 
other medical experts, that things 
could be very problematic come the 
fall. I hope and I pray that that is not 
the case. But we need to be prepared so 
that we can do the people’s business. 
I also want to publicly acknowledge 
my ranking member, the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). We don’t 
see eye-to-eye on this issue yet, but 
over our years-long working relation-
ship and friendship, we have found 
common ground many, many times. A 
task force is going to be convened 
today that includes myself, Mr. COLE, 
the chair and ranking member of the 
House Administration Committee, Ms. 
LOFGREN, and Mr. DAVIS, as well as 
Democratic Leader HOYER and Repub-
lican Leader MCCARTHY
to discuss 
these matters. 
I have been saying this for a month, 
and I am going to say it again here 
today: If you are a Member of Congress 
and you care about this issue, call me. 
I want to hear from Members what 
they think about this critically impor-
tant matter. 
Now, back to the measure before us. 
Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, the 
Rules Committee met and reported a 
rule, House Resolution 938, providing 
that upon passage of the rule, H. Res. 
935, which establishes a Select Sub-
committee on the Coronavirus Crisis as 
a select investigative subcommittee of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form is hereby adopted. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today as 
Congress continues responding to the 
biggest public health and economic 
emergency this Nation has seen in 100 
years: The coronavirus pandemic. 
What started just weeks ago half a 
world away is having a devastating im-
pact across our country. No commu-
nity has been spared: 
More than 855,000 cases have been 
confirmed; 
Nearly 48,000 lives lost as of the time 
we are meeting right now; 
And more than 22 million initial un-
employment claims filed in the past 
month. 
Some regions of our country have 
now lost as many jobs over the last 
month as they did during the worst 
year of the Great Recession. 
These statistics are not just numbers 
on a page, Madam Speaker. These are 
our neighbors. They are our family. 
They are our friends. Their health is at 
risk, and their economic reality has 
changed overnight. Since the start of 
this pandemic, Congress has provided 
more than $2 trillion in emergency re-
lief to get small businesses the finan-
cial help that they need to survive, to 
help hospitals and healthcare workers 
on the front lines, to expand testing, to 
provide every American access to an 
affordable vaccine when it is developed. 
And I could go on and on and on. 
We need to make sure these resources 
are going where Congress intended, 
that they are helping struggling Amer-
icans and small businesses without any 
rampant fraud or abuse, and that com-
panies aren’t taking part in price- 
gouging or profiteering. 
That 
is 
what 
this 
Select 
Sub-
committee on the Coronavirus is all 
about. This proactive approach is what 
then-Senator 
Harry 
Truman 
spear-
headed at the dawn of World War II to 
ensure Federal dollars spent then saved 
lives on the battlefield. 
Well, today the battle is much dif-
ferent. It is against a worldwide pan-
demic currently without a vaccine or 
preventative treatment. But our ag-
gressive oversight should be the same. 
Democratic governors and Republican 
governors all over the country are 
pleading for more tests, despite the bil-
lions we have allocated to provide 
them. 
The Republican governor of Mary-
land has said the lack of available test-
ing is the number one stumbling block 
in America. He is absolutely right. 
The President talks about reopening 
America, but Madam Speaker, how 
about first testing America? Without 
that, we can’t fully track and contain 
this virus. We need to make sure that 
the money we provided for testing is 
actually going to testing. We need to 
make sure that our hospitals have all 
the PPE equipment that they need. 
In my home city of Worcester in Mas-
sachusetts, we recently opened up a 
field hospital in our convention center. 
The day before we opened, there was 
considerable anxiety because they had 
enough PPE maybe to last for a couple 
of days. Now working together with 
the governor and others, we were able 
to remedy that situation, but for so 
many of our healthcare institutions, 
for our first responders, trying to find 
PPE is like something out of the movie 
The Hunger Games. States competing 
with States, competing with the Fed-
eral 
Government, 
people 
receiving 
calls—I know somebody who knows 
somebody in China who might have 
lifesaving masks. Can you maybe fol-
low up that lead? That is not the way 
this is supposed to work. 
In the United States of America, the 
wealthiest Nation on the face of the 
Earth, officials are making cold calls 
to try to get enough equipment to sur-
vive the next surge of patients. Relying 
on the goodwill of people and busi-
nesses when they should be able to 
count on Federal agencies. Congress 
provided money for this equipment. We 
need to make sure it is going where it 
is badly needed. 
Madam Speaker, as we talk today 
about what Congress has done, I want 
to take a moment to talk about what 
it has not done, and that is provide 
enough for hungry families during this 
pandemic. 
You know, the President and so 
many of his allies in the Senate con-
tinue to block efforts to increase SNAP 
benefits for hungry people trying to 
put food on the table for their families. 
The demand for food banks right now 
wraps around city blocks in some 
places. We have seen it on TV. The 
lines go for miles. This is a crisis of 
food insecurity that we haven’t seen in 
this country since the Great Depres-
sion. 
Madam Speaker, whatever happened 
to taking care of the neediest among 
us? Maybe the President doesn’t have 
to worry about where his next meal is 
going to come from, but millions and 
millions and millions of Americans do. 
They are terrified. 
We should be suspending this admin-
istration’s SNAP cuts. We should be 
strengthening nutrition assistance for 
those impacted by this pandemic. And 
we should be showing the American 
people that ending hunger is not a par-
tisan issue. But some on the other side 
of Pennsylvania Avenue have chosen 
instead to take meals away from fami-
lies. 
Just yesterday the Secretary of Agri-
culture tried to paper over their dis-
graceful record by taking credit for the 
bill that we passed in a bipartisan way 
in Congress. The USDA didn’t increase 
SNAP benefits by 40 percent; the House 
Democrats led that charge and, thank-
fully, many of my Republican col-
leagues supported that in the Families 
First bill. 
And by the way, while we are at it, 
USDA was in court trying to kick mil-
lions of people off of SNAP through 
their disastrous regulatory scheme. 
The only thing this administration 
has done is to try to push people off of 
nutrition assistance. I think it is cold-
hearted and I think it is cruel for the 
Senate majority leader and others to 
turn their backs on struggling families. 
That needs to be fixed, and it has to be 
fixed in our next bill. And I hope in 
this Chamber, we can come together— 
Democrats and Republicans—and deal 
with it. 
I know that it is unrelated to the un-
derlying measure here, but hungry 
families are being ignored in this coun-
try. Sadly, even in the best of times, 
poor people oftentimes get ignored by 
this Chamber. I worry that in the worst 
of times, what we are going through 
right now, that these people, these in-
dividuals, these families become invis-
ible. We cannot let that happen. I want 
them to know that this House is listen-
ing to them, and we will continue to 
fight to strengthen the programs they 
rely on. 
Now, I don’t know what is radical 
about that. Just as I don’t understand 
why some on the other side are against 
a subcommittee that is designed to 
make sure that Federal dollars are 
spent well. 
b 1015 
I mean, that is what this is about. 
That is it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1909 
April 23, 2020 
This is an extraordinary time. We 
have sent trillions of dollars into our 
communities. They should be going to 
small businesses and not to big cor-
porations—our 
workers, 
not 
the 
wealthy and those already well-off. Our 
workers are the ones who should be our 
priority. We need to make sure that 
that is what is happening here. 
If you believe this administration has 
done things perfectly, then you have 
nothing to fear. But the American peo-
ple have a lot of questions and they de-
serve answers, and they expect us to 
live up to our constitutional respon-
sibilities with regard to oversight, and 
they deserve to know that their tax 
dollars are being well spent. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to thank my good friend, Mr. 
MCGOVERN, the distinguished chairman 
of the House Rules Committee, for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, let me quickly re-
spond to my friend’s mention about the 
group that will work on reopening Con-
gress. I look forward to working with 
my friend and our colleagues on that 
particular issue. 
I do want to point out, it is impor-
tant to note, last night we actually did 
function as a committee under the 
chairman’s leadership, and we got our 
work done. We are on the floor right 
now getting our work done. The execu-
tive branch is in Washington, D.C., 
right now getting its work done. 
The President and the Vice President 
aren’t hunkered down in Cheyenne 
Mountain. They are in the West Wing 
working every day. The Joint Chiefs of 
Staff are in the Pentagon, working 
every day. Every Cabinet member is 
working every day. 
I just say that to note that other peo-
ple are able to get their jobs done with 
appropriate changes and appropriate 
precautions, so I rule nothing in or out. 
I look forward to listening to my col-
league, but I do think we are capable of 
working in the House of Representa-
tives, and I will be extraordinarily cau-
tious about giving up procedures and 
precedents that are 230-plus years old. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today to 
consider a rule that creates Speaker 
PELOSI’s proposed select committee on 
the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this 
month, Speaker PELOSI announced that 
she would create this select com-
mittee, conveniently ignoring that any 
such select committee must be estab-
lished through the Rules Committee 
and, ultimately, through a vote on the 
House floor. 
Yesterday, the Rules Committee met 
on extremely short notice to, essen-
tially, rubberstamp the Speaker’s ac-
tion. This was particularly egregious 
considering that, up until right before 
we met, we had absolutely no details 
on the proposal. 
In the last month, the Speaker gave 
the minority no notice of her plans, no 
indication of her rationale or vision, 
and was radio silent since her an-
nouncement, except for the occasional 
media mention. In fact, we did not even 
know we were meeting on this item 
until the afternoon of the hearing. 
That is hardly the way to operate on 
something the Speaker purportedly 
wants to do in a bipartisan fashion. 
Perhaps 
even 
more 
problematic, 
Madam Speaker, is that I am not sure 
what the end goal of such committee 
will be. Speaker PELOSI claims that the 
proposed select committee will exam-
ine all aspects of the Federal response 
to the coronavirus pandemic and will 
provide oversight for Federal dollars 
being spent in response. 
But Congress already has significant 
oversight tools at our disposal. The 
CARES Act itself established a five- 
member Congressional Oversight Com-
mission specifically for that problem. 
That Commission is in addition to Con-
gress’ other oversight tools, which in-
clude the House Committee on Over-
sight and Reform and the oversight 
subcommittees that exist on most 
other permanent House committees. 
If we already have a separate Over-
sight Commission specifically for the 
CARES Act and we already have a sep-
arate Oversight and Reform Committee 
and each committee already has sepa-
rate oversight committees, what, then, 
is the actual purpose of the proposed 
select committee? 
It is entirely plausible for one to con-
clude that this new select committee 
will simply turn into yet another par-
tisan witch hunt aimed at damaging 
the President. 
There may be a time in the future 
when it makes sense to establish a 
commission, like the 9/11 Commission, 
to review the COVID–19 pandemic and 
the government response. I actually 
support doing that at an appropriate 
time. But such a commission needs to 
be truly bipartisan and devoted to 
what happened and what we can learn 
from it to improve government re-
sponses for the future. This select com-
mittee doesn’t meet that test. 
Before I reserve my time, later 
today, the House will be voting on the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
and 
Health Care Enhancement Act. This bi-
partisan bill is the next step and fol-
low-up to the CARES Act, which Con-
gress passed a few weeks ago. 
Today’s bill includes $310 billion for 
the Paycheck Protection Program, a 
critical program for protecting small 
businesses and their employees. It also 
includes $75 billion for hospitals on the 
front line of the coronavirus pandemic 
and 
a 
further 
$25 
billion 
for 
coronavirus testing. 
Refilling the Paycheck Protection 
Program account will help countless 
small businesses and their employees 
across the country, including hundreds 
in my district. Frankly, refilling this 
important account could not come 
soon enough. It should have happened a 
week ago. But I am fully supportive of 
this important bill, and I look forward 
to voting in favor of it later today. 
I urge opposition to the rule, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD an article, enti-
tled, ‘‘Democrats Pushed for Robust 
Oversight 
of 
the 
$2.2 
Trillion 
Coronavirus Aid Package. It Hasn’t 
Happened Yet,’’ detailing the need for 
oversight. The article explains that 
rapidly approved funds are being spent 
quickly with little monitoring or over-
sight. 
[From TIME, April 17, 2020] 
DEMOCRATS PUSHED FOR ROBUST OVERSIGHT 
OF
THE
$2.2 TRILLION
CORONAVIRUS
AID 
PACKAGE. IT HASN’T HAPPENED YET 
(By Alana Abramson) 
Some of the most heated negotiations be-
tween Democrats and Republicans over last 
month’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief pack-
age were over who should watch how that 
money gets spent. It is the largest emer-
gency relief fund the U.S. government has 
ever approved, and concerns over fraud and 
abuse were rife. In particular, Democrats 
were outraged that Republicans and the 
White House wanted to let the Treasury De-
partment distribute $500 billion to industry 
and states without anyone overseeing the 
process, and vowed to block any bill without 
that safeguard in place. 
‘‘There was this idea that they put forth 
that there would be a $500 billion slush fund 
for the Secretary of the Treasury with no ac-
countability whatsoever. Are you kidding?’’ 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last month 
after the bill passed the Senate. ‘‘For all re-
spect in the world for the Treasury Sec-
retary, that was a complete nonstarter.’’ 
Ultimately, the bill signed into law by 
President Donald Trump mandates the mas-
sive tranche of aid will be overseen through 
three key mechanisms: an inspector general 
at the Treasury Department to oversee that 
$500 billion Treasury fund, and Congress and 
executive branch panels, which will also 
monitor the Treasury fund and broadly over-
see the law’s implementation, respectively. 
But more than two weeks later, after hun-
dreds of billions of dollars have already 
flown out the door through the Paycheck 
Protection Program, the Treasury’s Inspec-
tor General post has not yet been confirmed 
by the Senate and the two panels are not 
fully staffed. Congress is preoccupied with 
the unprecedented task of managing dueling 
public health and economic crises remotely, 
and 
Trump, 
whose 
administration 
has 
blocked Congressional oversight for years, 
has already threatened to scuttle the proc-
ess. When he signed the bill into law in 
March, he said he would not allow the In-
spector General overseeing the executive 
branch’s committee to submit reports to 
Congress without his supervision, arguing it 
was unconstitutional. 
‘‘It’s incredibly problematic . . . those 
oversight mechanisms don’t do us much good 
if they aren’t functioning,’’ Liz Hempowicz, 
Director of Public Policy at the Project on 
Government Oversight, wrote in an e-mail to 
TIME. ‘‘This money is being spent incredibly 
quickly. The (Small Business Administra-
tion) has already spent the $349 billion dol-
lars allocated to the Paycheck Protection 
Program. It’s imperative that these over-
sight mechanisms are fully functional so we 
can have confidence that this money won’t 
be lost to waste, fraud, or abuse.’’ 
The group with the broadest oversight ju-
risdiction in the $2.2 trillion CARES Act is 
the executive branch panel, called the Pan-
demic Response Accountability Committee. 
Glenn Fine, who was acting Inspector Gen-
eral at the Pentagon, was quickly appointed

to lead the committee at the end of last 
month but was removed by Trump just a 
week later. The President did not provide a 
specific reason, but Fine’s ouster was part of 
a broader re-shuffling of watchdogs. 
Although the committee is composed of 
nearly two dozen inspectors general who 
have been appointed, the top spot remains 
vacant. The law mandates that Michael 
Horowitz, the Inspector General for the De-
partment of Justice who heads the Council of 
the Inspectors General on Integrity and Effi-
ciency, appoint a new head, but he has not 
yet announced Fine’s replacement. A spokes-
person for Horowitz did not respond to a 
query about when a new replacement would 
be named. 
On April 4, Trump announced that he had 
appointed Brian Miller to serve as the In-
spector General for the Treasury depart-
ment. Miller has over 15 years of federal ex-
perience; he spent nine years as the Inspec-
tor General for the General Services Admin-
istration, working under former Presidents 
George W. Bush and Barack Obama. But 
since 2018, he has worked as a Special Assist-
ant to the President and Senior Associate 
Counsel in the White House counsel’s office. 
His tenure there coincided with some of the 
White House counsel’s most high profile 
feuds with House Democrats in their over-
sight probes, including Trump’s impeach-
ment last December. 
Democrats lambasted Miller’s appoint-
ment, arguing that a Trump staffer would be 
unable to exercise the kind of independence 
the job requires. ‘‘To nominate a member of 
the President’s own staff is exactly the 
wrong type of person to choose for this posi-
tion,’’ Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schu-
mer said in a statement after Trump’s an-
nouncement. Since confirmations of presi-
dential appointees now only require a simple 
majority in the Senate, it’s likely that Mil-
ler will be confirmed despite Democrats’ ob-
jections. But since he cannot be confirmed 
by unanimous consent, lawmakers have to 
physically be in Washington for that to hap-
pen—and they are not expected to return 
until May 4th at the earliest. 
The final component of the oversight 
framework, the Congressional commission, 
is also incomplete. The bill mandates that 
the top four leaders in Congress—Schumer, 
Pelosi, 
Senate 
Majority 
Leader 
Mitch 
McConnell, 
and 
House 
Minority 
Leader 
Kevin McCarthy—each select a member for 
the panel. The fifth member will chair the 
committee and be jointly selected by Pelosi 
and McConnell. 
Schumer 
has 
appointed 
Bharat 
Ramamurti, who previously worked for Eliz-
abeth Warren as an economic adviser, on the 
panel. On Friday, McCarthy announced he 
had selected Rep. French Hill, McConnell an-
nounced he had chosen Pennsylvania Sen. 
Pat Toomey, and Pelosi selected Florida 
Rep. Donna Shalala. But as of Friday 
evening, the chair has not been selected, so 
the panel can’t fully function. Pelosi told re-
porters in her weekly press conference on 
Thursday that she and McConnell had agreed 
to submit names to each other for their joint 
pick. 
There are signs that additional oversight 
of the massive relief package not set up ex-
pressly in the law is also moving forward. 
Pelosi has appointed House Majority Whip 
Jim Clyburn to lead the House Select Com-
mittee on the coronavirus crisis, which she 
says will be a bipartisan committee dedi-
cated to oversight of all of the funds. And 
McConnell announced Friday that Idaho 
Senator Mike Crapo will lead the Senate’s 
efforts. 
In a New York Times op-ed earlier this 
week, Ramamurti urged Congress to act 
swiftly so his specific panel can get to work. 
‘‘Our watching eyes can help ensure that the 
money broadly benefits American families,’’ 
he wrote. ‘‘There isn’t time to waste.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include for the RECORD an article, enti-
tled, ‘‘Congressional Oversight of the 
CARES 
Act 
Could 
Prove 
Trouble-
some,’’ detailing the need for over-
sight. The article says oversight will 
help limit fraud and accelerate effec-
tive use of appropriated funds.

CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THE CARES 
ACT COULD PROVE TROUBLESOME 
(By Jackson Gode) 
On March 27th, President Trump signed 
the CARES Act providing for more than $2 
Trillion in federal spending in response to 
the COVID–19 crisis. Overseeing the outlay of 
relief funding from the bill will be no easy 
task, given its size, complexity and the back-
drop of the 2020 election. 
However, this is not the first time that a 
major government rescue package has in-
cluded oversight measures. The 2008 Emer-
gency Economic Stabilization Act created 
the office of the Special Inspector General 
for the Targeted Asset Relief Program the 
powers of which were strengthened by the 
SIGTARP Act of 2009. In just over a decade, 
SIGTARP 
has 
recovered 
$11 
Billion 
in 
misspent funds and successfully convicted 
380 fraudulent actors, leading many to con-
sider it a success. 
Members of Congress sought to mimic this 
success by including three major mecha-
nisms to oversee spending within the CARES 
Act. The Pandemic Response Accountability 
Committee will be made up of Inspectors 
General from, at minimum, nine federal 
agencies, and be responsible for oversight of 
outlays for the entire bill. A new office with-
in the Department of the Treasury, the Spe-
cial Inspector General for Pandemic Recov-
ery, will oversee the $500 billion Treasury 
fund for targeted loans to large businesses. 
Brian Miller, a White House lawyer and 
former GSA Inspector General, has already 
been selected for this role. Finally, a Con-
gressional Oversight Commission will in-
clude four members appointed by party lead-
ership in each chamber and a chairperson 
agreed to by the speaker of the House and 
the Senate majority leader. The Commission 
will oversee economic stability efforts by the 
Treasury Department and the Federal Re-
serve Board. 
The CARES Act also includes funding in-
creases for several preexisting oversight bod-
ies providing more than $140 million for In-
spectors General offices to investigate var-
ious aspects of the bill and $20 million in 
funds for the Government Accountability Of-
fice. 
Even with these mechanisms and funding 
increases, Congress will face several unique 
challenges 
while 
conducting 
substantive 
oversight of pandemic relief. 
First, the Trump Administration has indi-
cated reluctance to cooperate with oversight 
inquiries. 
Immediately 
after 
President 
Trump signed the CARES Act, the White 
House released a statement outlining his 
constitutional concerns with the newly cre-
ated 
Pandemic 
Response 
Accountability 
Committee and Special Inspector General for 
Pandemic Recovery. 
This is not the first time that Trump has 
questioned the legitimacy of oversight ef-
forts. The administration is currently tied 
up in several court battles regarding the ex-
ecutive branch’s ability to withhold informa-
tion from Congress. On March 16th, nearly a 
year after the original request, the Supreme 
Court postponed oral arguments in a case re-
garding the House Ways and Means Commit-
tee’s efforts to obtain President Trump’s tax 
returns. The administration has also with-
held information related to White House se-
curity clearances, natural disaster relief ef-
forts, and other areas of potential mis-
conduct. 
Second, both the House and Senate are on 
recess and it remains unclear when they will 
return. Once members come back to Wash-
ington, the number of committee hearings 
they hold will likely be lower than normal 
with social distancing recommendations re-
maining in effect. 
Hearings 
are 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
Congress’s oversight mandate as they pro-
vide lawmakers with a public platform to 
question administration officials that many 
rank-and-file members do not receive on a 
day-to-day basis. In place of hearings, mem-
bers will have to rely more heavily on writ-
ten correspondence. While letters have the 
potential to be more effective than hearings 
at obtaining detailed information, recipients 
are only legally required to respond to in-
quiries from committee chairs. 
The current administration has made a 
habit of ignoring written information re-
quests and it remains too soon to tell wheth-
er COVID–19 oversight will be met with simi-
lar resistance. Documents released by the 
House Oversight and Reform Committee on 
the availability of medical supplies from the 
federal government’s stockpile suggest that 
the administration is responding to at least 
some inquiries. Partial or private responses 
however, can make it difficult for commit-
tees to signal a lack of cooperation to the 
public. 
Third, as their efforts to oversee the 
Trump administration response ramp up, 
House Democrats may find themselves con-
fronting intra-party cooperation challenges. 
Due to the political visibility of the pan-
demic, committee chairs will likely compete 
to demonstrate their willingness to hold the 
administration 
accountable. 
Coordination 
among Democrats will be necessary to en-
sure that panels’ efforts are complementary, 
rather than competitive. 
Conflict between the parties will also cre-
ate challenges. The creation of a Select Com-
mittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic already 
seems to be increasing tensions between 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) and Minor-
ity Leader Kevin McCarthy (R–Calif.) who 
indicated that Republicans will object to a 
unanimous consent request creating the 
panel. Speaker Pelosi has signaled the pro-
file she expects the committee’s work to 
have by naming Majority Whip Jim Clyburn 
(D–S.C.) as chair. The committee will have 
subpoena power, but the House’s experience 
so far this Congress with having to go to 
court to try to enforce subpoenas illustrates 
the limits of that tool. 
Finally, the Trump administration has be-
come famous for vacancies and ‘‘acting’’ offi-
cials in the highest positions of government. 
By tolerating a large number of acting posi-
tions, the Senate has given up one of its 
most important tools for influencing execu-
tive branch conduct. On April 3rd, the Presi-
dent nominated five individuals to Inspector 
General positions. However, while the Senate 
remains on recess, those roles will continue 
to be served by officials in an acting capac-
ity. 
Four of the IG offices receiving funding in-
creases from the CARES Act are currently 
headed by acting officials. Notably, Glenn 
Fine, the Department of Defense Inspector 
General who was originally appointed as the 
Chairman of PRAC, only served in an acting 
capacity. On April 7th, President Trump re-
moved him from the DOD IG role and ap-
pointed 
EPA 
Inspector 
General 
Sean 
O’Donnell, making Fine ineligible to be 
PRAC Chairman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1911 
April 23, 2020 
Congress will face many challenges pro-
tecting against fraud and helping an econ-
omy stalled by the pandemic, which may re-
quire members to find unique solutions for 
ensuring effective implementation of the 
CARES Act. With $2 trillion of taxpayer 
money on the line, nothing is more impor-
tant than effective oversight. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include for the RECORD an April 4 ABC 
News article, entitled, ‘‘Experts Warn 
About Big Dollar Fraud in $2.2 Trillion 
Coronavirus Relief Package.’’ 
[From ABC News, April 4, 2020] 
EXPERTS WARN ABOUT BIG DOLLAR FRAUD IN 
$2.2 TRILLION CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE 
(By Benjamin Siegel) 
The U.S. government’s historic $2.2 trillion 
coronavirus aid relief package recently ap-
proved by Congress is highly vulnerable to 
fraud and abuse, oversight experts and vet-
eran watchdogs who investigated abuse of 
the government’s financial system bailout 
more than a decade ago told ABC News. 
The size of the unprecedented relief pack-
age—in the scale of spending and the number 
of businesses eligible for funds—will make it 
difficult to verify the information from each 
applicant, and how they plan to use their 
money. 
With roughly 10 million Americans filing 
jobless claims over the last two weeks, and 
millions of small businesses seeking govern-
ment aid to stay afloat, the need for the gov-
ernment to immediately push out money to 
Americans and into the staggering economy 
could hinder efforts to filter out efforts from 
potential fraudsters to seek relief funds. 
Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News 
Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special 
coverage of the novel coronavirus with the 
full ABC News team, including the latest 
news, context and analysis. 
‘‘Everybody’s acceptance of some or a lot 
of fraud is going to have to be high, because 
it’s going to happen,’’ said Earl Devaney, 
who served as the top watchdog of the Re-
covery Accountability and Transparency 
Board, which tracked the stimulus spending 
following the Great Recession in the late 
2000s. 
Though the legislation mandates multiple 
oversight bodies, if even a small percentage 
of the funds are misused, it could mean fraud 
on the scale of potentially millions, if not 
billions, before there are any efforts to re-
coup losses, according to experts. 
They see the $350 billion in funding ear-
marked for small businesses in the form of 
forgivable loans as particularly susceptible 
to abuse. Millions of small business owners 
began applying to banks for the loans on Fri-
day, though many applicants and lenders ex-
perienced problems with the program’s roll-
out. 
While the Treasury Department has said 
money will begin flowing immediately, some 
institutions, including JP Morgan Chase, 
said Thursday they would not be ready to re-
ceive applications by Friday. 
Other veteran investigators are concerned 
that the review process, which leaves it up to 
banks to vet potential borrowers and appli-
cants to attest to their eligibility, doesn’t 
give authorities enough time to effectively 
weed out potential fraud. 
‘‘If you have fewer entities that has a lot 
of implications for oversight. It’s fewer enti-
ties to worry about. But it also means that 
the processes for application can be a little 
more thoughtful,’’ Neil Barofsky, the former 
special inspector general of the $700 billion 
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), told 
ABC News. 
‘‘In contrast here, the very purpose of 
these programs is not to impact a relatively 
small number of institutions but to reach as 
far and wide as possible,’’ he said. 
The small business loan initiative, known 
as the Paycheck Protection Program, will be 
‘‘an extraordinarily easy program to defraud, 
and it will be defrauded in massive ways,’’ he 
added. 
The $2.2 trillion, 880–page CARES ACT ap-
proved by Congress last week included over-
sight provisions, modeled after some of the 
safeguards implemented to track the finan-
cial system bailout and stimulus money 
after the Great Recession. 
It formed three major groups to lead over-
sight efforts: A new special inspector gen-
eral, who will be nominated by Trump and 
confirmed by the Senate, will be responsible 
for oversight of the $500 billion fund adminis-
tered by the Treasury Department and Sec-
retary Steven Mnuchin. 
Trump plans to nominate Brian Miller, a 
special assistant to the president and senior 
associate counsel in the Office of White 
House Counsel, to serve as inspector general, 
the White House announced Friday night. 
A five-member panel appointed by a bipar-
tisan group of lawmakers will monitor the 
Treasury Department program and Federal 
Reserve’s implementation of the stimulus 
package. 
The third group, the Pandemic Response 
Accountability Committee, have the broad-
est mandate, aimed at rooting out waste and 
fraud throughout programs in the entire $2.2 
trillion relief package. 
Led by Glenn Fine, the acting inspector 
general of the Department of Defense who 
was part of the panel’s precursor following 
the financial crisis, the group will be able to 
conduct audits, subpoena individuals and in-
formation, and refer matters to the Justice 
Department for investigation. 
‘‘Every time there’s kind of an emergency 
surge in spending like this it’s even more im-
portant that there’s additional layers of 
oversight to make sure that everything is on 
the up and up,’’ Liz Hempowicz, the director 
of public policy at the Project on Govern-
ment Oversight, told ABC News. 
House and Senate Democrats, who were 
particularly worried about how the $500 bil-
lion supervised by Mnuchin will be awarded, 
also pushed Republicans to add additional 
language into the legislation preventing 
President Trump, his family, top govern-
ment officials and lawmakers from receiving 
loans or investments from the Treasury pro-
grams. 
Already, there are signs that President 
Trump and Democrats could tangle over 
oversight of the massive stimulus programs 
as money begins to flow from the federal 
government to workers and businesses. 
Trump’s plans to nominate Miller, a 
former inspector general for the General 
Services Administration, will likely be met 
with criticism by Democrats. Inspectors 
General are typically independent and apo-
litical appointees; Miller played a role in re-
buffing investigations into the withheld 
military aid to Ukraine that led to Trump’s 
impeachment. 
In a signing statement last week, Trump 
said he wouldn’t allow the inspector general 
to share information with Congress without 
‘‘presidential supervision,’’ objecting to the 
provisions of the law that require the watch-
dog to notify Congress when they are ‘‘un-
reasonably’’ denied information about the 
stimulus program. 
Democrats criticized the comments, and on 
Thursday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi an-
nounced the formation of a special select 
committee to provide additional oversight of 
the recovery funds and the administration’s 
management of the coronavirus crisis, a 
move Republicans and the White House 
quickly condemned as redundant. 
Mnuchin on Thursday said he didn’t think 
the panel was necessary. 
‘‘Both parties wanted us to have oversight, 
wanted us to have transparency. We have 
full transparency,’’ he said at the daily 
White House coronavirus briefing. 
‘‘It’s witch hunt after witch hunt after 
witch hunt,’’ Trump said of the select com-
mittee at the same briefing. 
Senate Finance Committee Ranking Mem-
ber Ron Wyden, D–Ore., on Saturday, issued 
the following statement on the nomination 
of Brian Miller to be special inspector gen-
eral for pandemic recovery: 
‘‘The special inspector general needs to be 
independent above all. Someone who cur-
rently works in the White House counsel’s 
office, serving a president who has tried to 
silence other inspector generals and an-
nounced his intention to silence this one, is 
not independent. It’s no wonder President 
Trump announced this nomination late on a 
Friday evening.’’ 
‘‘While Mr. Miller has requisite experience 
for this position, he must clear a high bar to 
show the Senate he would protect the inter-
ests of the American people over the polit-
ical interests of this administration.’’ 
While it’s not uncommon for both parties 
to snipe over the use—and potential abuse— 
of stimulus funds, the level of partisanship 
in Washington and the immediate need for 
the funds to be delivered to businesses and 
Americans make this situation much more 
difficult than the oversight efforts following 
the last recession, Devaney told ABC News. 
‘‘The atmosphere on the Hill, I thought it 
was acrimonious when I was there. It’s a lot 
worse today and I suspect that whoever 
takes this job is going to be testifying once 
a week,’’ he said of the eventual special in-
spector general. 
Former Rep. Tom Davis, R–Virginia, who 
served as chair of the House Oversight Com-
mittee, defended the stimulus package, given 
the time constraints put on lawmakers and 
the Trump administration. 
‘‘It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen in the 
last 50 years,’’ he told ABC News. ‘‘Emer-
gency situations call for emergency meas-
ures. You can’t sit and write layers and lay-
ers of oversight.’’ 
‘‘There’s always going to be money going 
to people who shouldn’t have gotten it,’’ 
Davis said. ‘‘The question is, what were the 
alternatives? 
Lawmakers 
and 
coronavirus 
stimulus 
watchdogs won’t just have this historic $2.2 
trillion coronavirus package to police. Con-
versations have already started on Capitol 
Hill around a fourth phase of relief funding, 
including more money for small businesses. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
this emergency surge in spending to 
confront the coronavirus is unprece-
dented, but the idea of what we are es-
tablishing is not. As I said, then-Sen-
ator Truman proposed it at the dawn of 
World War II. It worked then, and it 
will work now as well. 
So if you believe that this adminis-
tration has nothing to hide, then no-
body should oppose this and let the 
American people see how their money 
is being spent. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
the House, who has been an incredible 
leader during this pandemic. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his leadership as chair 
of the Rules Committee for bringing 
this important legislation to the floor 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1912 
April 23, 2020 
I also acknowledge the bipartisan co-
operation of the Republicans in this 
House and pay tribute to Mr. COLE, 
who is highly respected on both sides of 
the aisle. I am sorry that he doesn’t see 
a pattern in this, as the Republicans 
have had these kinds of committees 
time and again. I never heard him 
question them then, but I do hear him 
questioning them today. 
But I am very pleased that the two of 
them will be working together with the 
distinguished 
majority 
leader, 
Mr. 
HOYER, and the distinguished Repub-
lican leader, Mr. MCCARTHY, as well as 
with the leadership of Chairwoman 
LOFGREN and Ranking Member DAVIS 
in the days ahead to consider the pro-
posal that we have for how we can act 
as a Congress when everybody cannot 
be present. 
I see in the paper that I pulled it. No, 
I didn’t pull it. I said all along I wanted 
this to be bipartisan. As Speaker of the 
whole House, as we changed how we 
participate, I wanted it to be bipar-
tisan. When we saw that that oppor-
tunity existed, in my conversation 
with 
the 
distinguished 
Republican 
leader, Mr. MCCARTHY, I then said we 
have to give this a chance. 
I do think that there are many op-
tions that may be available. We want 
to give all the options to our Members, 
but consistent with the Constitution of 
the United States, the rules of the 
House of Representatives, the security 
of this body’s information, as well as, 
again, the technology to make sure it 
works when we are depending on it. 
So I yield to the wisdom that they 
will bring to all of this to give Mem-
bers as many options as possible and to 
do so in a way that, again, is respectful 
of this being the coronavirus—and not 
just for how we do business generally, 
but in this specific time—as, also, a 
template for any other kind of emer-
gency that might arise. 
So I thank the chairman and I thank 
Ranking Member COLE for their com-
ments about willingness to discuss 
that, and hopefully by the time we re-
turn, if that is May 4, we will have an 
opportunity to vote in a bipartisan way 
on how we can do that. 
By the way, when we are talking 
about proxy voting, we have to be sure 
that it is consistent with the wishes of 
the Member of Congress who is yielding 
a proxy, consistent with his or her rep-
resentation of their district. It is not 
just a license to the proxy holder to 
work his or her well or the leadership 
to have a handful of proxies. It is about 
the actual representation of that per-
son whose district, his or her district, 
wishes to vote on a matter, with not 
that much latitude except as spelled 
out by the granter of the proxy. 
As a new Member of Congress—some 
of you may have identified with this— 
I would go into a committee room and 
think I had the best argument in the 
world for my new, fresh idea as a Mem-
ber of Congress, and the chairman 
would have a pocketful of proxies and 
there was no need to even have a dis-
cussion if he or she were not in agree-
ment. So I have been a victim of that, 
and I don’t want there to be any doubt 
in mind that it is a complete, accurate, 
guardrailed reflection of the wish of 
the person granting the proxy. 
Having said that, I want to salute our 
distinguished chairman for his cham-
pionship. He has gone on starvation, 
this, that, and the other on behalf of 
solving the hunger crisis, the food inse-
curity crisis in our country, and his en-
thusiasm on SNAP and what we are 
doing as we go forward, the recognition 
that people are hungry in our country 
and that we have to do something 
about it. 
But hearing him as chair of the Rules 
Committee talk about that, recog-
nizing his history, chair of the task 
force on hunger, so many times going 
on starvation diets and I would say, 
‘‘Why are you doing that? I am not 
sure the other side even cares if you 
are on a starvation diet,’’ but, nonethe-
less, I salute the gentleman again and 
again for his leadership on that. 
So, Madam Speaker, here we are, and 
I thank Mr. MCGOVERN, our distin-
guished chairman, for bringing this 
resolution to the floor, again for his 
great leadership trying to move us for-
ward in a bipartisan way to continue 
the operations of Congress during this 
extraordinary time. I again acknowl-
edge Mr. COLE’s interest in doing that 
as well. 
Our Nation faces a deadly virus, a 
battered economy with tens of thou-
sands of sick, some died, millions out 
of work. This is really a very, very, 
very sad day. 
We come to the floor with nearly 
50,000 deaths, a huge number of people 
impacted, and the uncertainty of it all. 
We have to be very prayerful, and we 
have to be as bipartisan as we can pos-
sibly be, as united, working together. 
The bill we will vote on later today, 
which I will speak about later today, is 
the fourth bipartisan bill that we will 
be passing in the Congress of the 
United States. Starting March 4, we 
had our first bill: testing, testing, test-
ing; 
shortly 
thereafter, 
the 
14th: 
masks, masks, masks, in terms of the 
personal protective equipment that 
people needed; and, again, our big 
CARES Act, which was bipartisan, as is 
this bill today. That is why I hope, as 
we continue to talk about how Con-
gress conducts itself, we can do so in a 
bipartisan way. 
Congress, again, has taken important 
steps in addressing this crisis, as I 
mentioned, by passing three bills, over 
$2 trillion in desperately needed emer-
gency relief. We started: emergency, 
emergency, mitigation for the impact 
on the health and the economy of our 
country. We hope to soon get to a re-
covery phase. But right now, we are 
still in mitigation. 
Again, later today, as we pass this, 
the fourth bill and urgently needed in-
terim bill, I am very pleased that it 
was transformed from a bill 2 weeks 
ago on the floor where the leader in the 
Senate said: This is it, 250. We are not 
doing anything else. 
That failed to get unanimous con-
sent. At the same time, that other pro-
posal was put forth. But I will talk 
about that later. 
Again, why we are here for this par-
ticular initiative is we need to ensure 
that the historic advancement of dol-
lars in these bills and in future pack-
ages are spent carefully and effectively 
to save lives and rebuild our economy. 
b 1030 
As the distinguished chairman men-
tioned, at the dawn of World War II, 
then-Senator 
Harry 
Truman 
spear-
headed the creation of a special com-
mittee to ensure that the dollars spent 
on the war effort had oversight and ac-
countability. 
Now, there was a democratic Presi-
dent in the White House, President 
Roosevelt, so this was not partisan in 
any way, nor should this be considered 
partisan. The purpose was to prevent 
waste, fraud, and abuse, profiteering, 
price-gouging, and the rest. 
As Truman said later, when he was 
President, he was interviewed about 
this and he said: I knew that after 
World War I there had been 116 com-
mittees set up to investigate the 
money spent in World War I. 116 com-
mittees, after the fact. He said: First of 
all, there had been 116 investigating 
committees after the fact, and I felt 
one committee before the fact would 
prevent a lot of waste and maybe even 
save some lives. And that, he said, is 
the way it worked out. 
The Truman committee turned into a 
tremendous investment for taxpayers. 
The total cost at the time was less 
than $1 million, and it saved lives and 
nearly $15 billion by preventing waste, 
fraud, and abuse. That is the equiva-
lent of like $750 billion today. 
What made sense then makes even 
more sense now. That is why the House 
is forming a special bipartisan over-
sight panel, the House Select Com-
mittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. 
And by the way, Mr. COLE, I did in-
form the distinguished leader of my in-
tention to announce such a thing be-
fore I did. 
The committee won’t root out waste, 
fraud, and abuse. We keep saying it. It 
will be laser focused on ensuring that 
taxpayer money goes to workers’ pay-
checks and benefits, and it will ensure 
that the Federal response is based on 
the best possible science and guided by 
health experts and that the money in-
vested is not being exploited by profit-
eers and price-gougers. 
We already have been hearing of fam-
ilies facing scams. There are people out 
there creating scams to steal the direct 
payment checks. The Secretary of HHS 
told me of a scam, one entity was sell-
ing masks they didn’t even have. That 
is why this is so important, and that 
timing is important, so people know we 
will be watching how these tax dollars 
are spent. 
I agree with Mr. COLE. There is plen-
ty of time later for an after-action re-
view of what went before. What we are

talking about is how this money is 
spent as we go forward, to make sure, 
as President Truman—Senator Truman 
at the time—did, to put a spotlight on 
the factories that were doing the work 
that they were supposed to be doing. 
We have a tall order in terms of vac-
cines and therapies and the rest, and 
we want to be sure that if there is, God 
willing, a vaccine soon or a cure, even 
sooner than that, that we will be able 
to have the resources available in 
places where they need to be in real 
time, to be able to advance that. 
Led by Majority Whip CLYBURN—and 
I am very proud of him, Mr. CLYBURN. 
I had the privilege of naming him then 
to oversee what was happening in re-
sponse to Katrina, and he just was 
magnificent in his precision of thought 
and objectivity. 
And again, this isn’t about assigning 
blame. This is about taking responsi-
bility and to be able to answer for what 
we have put forth, that it really did 
work. 
And so, the committee will exercise 
oversight to ensure that the historic 
investment of taxpayers’ dollars, which 
is enormous, are being used wisely and 
efficiently and that nobody is ripping 
us off. Because where there is big 
money—we 
know 
this—people 
will 
come up with a scam of some kind. 
Mr. CLYBURN’s leadership, again, is 
essential to the work. His review of the 
response to Hurricane Katrina, which I 
mentioned, and so many issues critical 
to working families, I am proud that he 
has accepted the opportunity to serve 
our country in this role now. 
We urge our Republican colleagues 
and the administration to join us in re-
specting this oversight, that we can 
save lives, deliver relief, and protect 
our economy. And I say this with all 
the hope that I can muster, that we can 
do this in a very bipartisan way. 
So anyone who is thinking of a scam 
or a delay in terms of how the product 
we are looking out for is produced and 
how available it is to everyone in our 
country, they will know that we, again, 
are watching from both sides of the 
aisle how taxpayers’ dollars are being 
spent. 
With that, I once again thank the 
distinguished chairman for bringing 
this important legislation to the floor. 
I hope that we may—on a different side 
of this vote, when the committee is 
formed—have much in common in how 
we put a very bright light on how the 
money 
is 
spent 
to 
make 
people 
healthier, 
to 
make 
our 
economy 
stronger, and to do so in a way that 
brings us all together. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank the Speaker for her kind and 
thoughtful remarks. 
I also want to acknowledge—I am 
going to follow her example. I think we 
should keep our mask on when we are 
doing our normal business but take 
them off when we are speaking. And 
thank you for setting that example, 
Madam Speaker. 
With that, I would like to yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, first, I 
want to say that I am praying for com-
fort for all of the families that have 
lost someone to COVID–19. I also want 
to pray for the families and those peo-
ple that are in the hospitals now sick 
from COVID–19, that they have total 
and complete healing. 
And I want to thank the healthcare 
workers, the grocery store workers, the 
truckers, everybody that every day is 
putting their health at risk and their 
family’s health at risk to keep the 
economy going and to help Americans. 
And it is really good to be back here 
today in Congress working and con-
tinuing to do our job during this crisis. 
You know, two weeks ago, in the 
Senate—it was two weeks ago now—the 
Senate Republicans put up a bill to 
help continue funding for small busi-
nesses so they could pay their workers. 
Two weeks—two weeks—we have been 
waiting around while Democrats have 
been delaying it. And why? I don’t un-
derstand why. 
I have had businesses, just like all of 
my fellow Members of Congress, that 
have called me and said: I need the 
money; I need the money from this pro-
gram, or my business is going to go 
under. 
Two weeks ago this could have hap-
pened. But, no, in those two weeks, 
millions and millions more people filed 
for 
unemployment 
insurance. 
And 
why? We could have done this funding 
for small businesses so they could pay 
their workers two weeks ago. I am 
thankful that we are finally—finally— 
getting it done. 
Now, the rule talks about Speaker 
PELOSI’s oversight committee. Maybe 
that is the reason that Democrats de-
layed funding for small businesses and 
their workers for two weeks. 
Why do we need another oversight 
committee? Speaker PELOSI said, oh, it 
is going to be all bipartisan. I am 
sorry; I don’t believe it. And the reason 
I don’t believe it is because since the 
beginning of 2019, I have served on 
three committees, including Judiciary 
Committee, and in every single com-
mittee, the entire goal has been non-
stop to criticize President Trump and 
try to influence the 2020 election. 
And now you are going to tell me 
that you are going to have another 
oversight 
committee, 
even 
though 
every standing committee has over-
sight on this, and we have inspector 
generals and the CARES Act has over-
sight. Now we need a ninth committee 
to do oversight, and it is supposedly 
going to be bipartisan? I am sorry. I 
call BS. 
And the reason I know this is because 
of past history. While Democrats were 
focusing on impeachment, the Presi-
dent was working on coronavirus. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the reason why we are doing this is be-
cause the President is undercutting 
oversight. 
Madam Speaker, I want to insert in 
the RECORD ‘‘Trump Ousts Pandemic 
Spending Watchdog Known for Inde-
pendence.’’ 
[From The New York Times, April 7, 2020] 
TRUMP OUSTS PANDEMIC SPENDING WATCHDOG 
KNOWN FOR INDEPENDENCE 
(By Ben Protess, Steve Eder, and David 
Enrich) 
WASHINGTON—President Trump moved on 
Tuesday to oust the leader of a new watch-
dog panel charged with overseeing how his 
administration spends trillions of taxpayer 
dollars in coronavirus pandemic relief, the 
latest step in an abruptly unfolding White 
House power play against semi-independent 
inspectors general across the government. 
The official, Glenn A. Fine, has been the 
acting inspector general for the Defense De-
partment since before Mr. Trump took office 
and was set to become the chairman of a new 
Pandemic Response Accountability Com-
mittee to police how the government carries 
out the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. 
But Mr. Trump replaced Mr. Fine in his Pen-
tagon job, disqualifying him from serving on 
the new oversight panel. 
The move came at a time when the presi-
dent has been reasserting authority over the 
executive branch and signaling impatience 
with independent voices within the govern-
ment that he considers disloyal. In recent 
days, he fired an inspector general who re-
viewed the whistle-blower complaint that led 
to his impeachment, nominated a White 
House aide to another key inspector general 
post, declared that he would ignore certain 
oversight provisions in the new relief law 
and attacked another inspector general who 
criticized virus testing shortages. 
Mr. Trump even cheered the firing of the 
captain of an aircraft carrier for sending a 
letter to fellow Navy officers pleading for 
help for his virus-stricken crew, castigating 
the officer for airing unfavorable informa-
tion. Only after a loud backlash over the fir-
ing and the acting Navy secretary’s speech 
calling the captain ‘‘stupid’’ did the presi-
dent partly reverse himself and say he would 
look into it. The acting Navy secretary, who 
said he had ordered the firing because he as-
sumed Mr. Trump might have done it himself 
otherwise, took the hint and resigned on 
Tuesday. 
The questions of accountability and loy-
alty within the government have been per-
sistent themes in the past three years as Mr. 
Trump has repeatedly waged war with what 
he calls ‘‘the deep state.’’ He has rejected the 
conventional views that figures like the di-
rector of the F.B.I., the attorney general, in-
telligence 
directors, 
uniformed 
military 
commanders, ethics officers and now inspec-
tors general should have a degree of auton-
omy. 
At his daily coronavirus briefing, Mr. 
Trump offered no particular explanation for 
sidelining Mr. Fine but characterized it as 
part of a larger shuffle of inspectors general, 
some of them left over from past administra-
tions, and cited unspecified ‘‘reports of 
bias.’’ 
Critics said on Tuesday that it sent a mes-
sage to government watchdogs to tread soft-
ly. ‘‘I cannot see how any inspector general 
will feel in any way safe to do a good job,’’ 
said Danielle Brian, the executive director of 
the Project on Government Oversight, a non-
profit group. ‘‘They are all at the mercy at 
what the president feels.’’ 
But Mr. Trump’s allies said he felt burned 
by the investigations of his campaign and as-
sociates and therefore distrusts figures he 
perceives to be partisan foes within govern-
ment, particularly former F.B.I. officials 
who obtained warrants under the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to in-
vestigate a campaign aide’s ties to Russia. 
‘‘I’ve never heard the president express 
frustrations about independent oversight,’’ 
said Cliff Sims, a former White House aide.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1914 
April 23, 2020 
‘‘But he doesn’t think he should be subjected 
to his political enemies in supposedly apo-
litical oversight roles. This has been deeply 
ingrained in his psyche since the moment he 
learned that FISA had been abused to spy on 
his campaign.’’ 
In removing Mr. Fine from his role over-
seeing pandemic spending, Mr. Trump tar-
geted a former Justice Department inspector 
general who earned a reputation for aggres-
sive independence in scrutinizing the F.B.I.’s 
use of surveillance and other law enforce-
ment powers in the years after the Sept. 11, 
2001, attacks. 
Replacing Mr. Fine as the Pentagon’s act-
ing inspector general will be Sean O’Donnell, 
who serves as the inspector general at the 
Environmental Protection Agency and will 
do double duty for the time being. A group of 
inspectors general led by Michael E. Horo-
witz, the Justice Department inspector gen-
eral, will determine who will replace Mr. 
Fine as chairman of the new pandemic over-
sight committee. 
Created as part of the coronavirus relief 
bill, the committee consists of nine inspec-
tors general from across the executive 
branch and will have an $80 million budget to 
hunt for waste, fraud, abuse and illegality in 
the disbursement of the $2.2 trillion approved 
by Congress to provide relief to Americans 
affected by the pandemic. 
In announcing Mr. Fine’s short-lived role 
last week, Mr. Horowitz had praised him as 
‘‘uniquely qualified’’ to run oversight of 
‘‘large organizations,’’ citing his 11 years as 
the top Justice Department watchdog and 
his four years serving as the top Pentagon 
one. 
‘‘The inspector general community recog-
nizes the need for transparency surrounding, 
and strong and effective independent over-
sight of, the federal government’s spending 
in response to this public health crisis,’’ Mr. 
Horowitz said at the time. 
Democrats immediately condemned Mr. 
Fine’s sudden ouster as ‘‘corrupt,’’ in the 
words of Senator Chuck Schumer of New 
York, 
the 
minority 
leader. 
‘‘President 
Trump is abusing the coronavirus pandemic 
to eliminate honest and independent public 
servants because they are willing to speak 
truth to power and because he is so clearly 
afraid of strong oversight,’’ Mr. Schumer 
said. 
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Demo-
crat of New York and the chairwoman of the 
House Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee, called Mr. Trump’s actions ‘‘a 
direct insult to the American taxpayers—of 
all political stripes—who want to make sure 
that their tax dollars are not squandered on 
wasteful boondoggles, incompetence or polit-
ical favors.’’ 
Still, it is not a given that Mr. O’Donnell 
will toe the line at the Pentagon. At the 
E.P.A., he has issued reports that are critical 
of Mr. Trump’s appointed administrator, An-
drew R. Wheeler, who has sought to limit 
Mr. O’Donnell’s authority and oversight. 
Only last week, after Mr. O’Donnell’s office 
released a report concluding that the E.P.A. 
failed to adequately warn communities liv-
ing in proximity to certain carcinogenic 
chemicals of their health risks, Mr. Wheeler 
publicly rebuked the inspector general’s re-
port for its ‘‘tone and substance’’ and de-
manded that he rescind it. Mr. O’Donnell re-
fused. 
Privately, some people within the govern-
ment’s inspector general community sug-
gested 
that 
the 
appointment 
of 
Mr. 
O’Donnell to the Pentagon post would divert 
his oversight from the E.P.A., which has con-
tinued to move forward with Mr. Trump’s 
agenda of reducing or eliminating public 
health and environmental regulations, even 
as the coronavirus rages. 
Before being appointed as the E.P.A. 
watchdog, Mr. O’Donnell clerked for two fed-
eral judges and worked since 2005 as a career 
lawyer at the Justice Department, most re-
cently in the criminal division working on 
cases involving fraud, corruption and na-
tional security. 
At the Pentagon, Mr. O’Donnell will serve 
in an acting capacity pending Senate action 
on Jason Abend, a Customs and Border Pro-
tection official, who was nominated by Mr. 
Trump last week to take on the post perma-
nently. Mr. Fine remains the No. 2 official at 
the Pentagon’s watchdog office. 
Late last month, several hours after Mr. 
Trump signed the $2 trillion coronavirus re-
lief and stimulus bill with fanfare on tele-
vision, he issued a signing statement chal-
lenging a key safeguard congressional Demo-
crats insisted upon as a condition of approv-
ing $500 billion in corporate bailout funds: 
that a special inspector general be empow-
ered to demand information about how the 
Treasury Department spends the money and 
who would be required to tell Congress if ex-
ecutive branch officials unreasonably balk. 
In his signing statement, Mr. Trump effec-
tively declared that he could control what 
information goes to Congress about any dis-
putes over access to information about how 
and why the money is spent. On Friday, he 
nominated Brian D. Miller, a White House 
aide, to serve as the special inspector general 
overseeing the corporate relief. 
Then late that night, Mr. Trump fired the 
inspector general for the intelligence com-
munity, Michael K. Atkinson, whose insist-
ence on telling Congress about the whistle- 
blower complaint about Mr. Trump’s deal-
ings with Ukraine prompted impeachment 
proceedings last fall. 
At the same time, Mr. Trump also an-
nounced a slew of other inspector general 
nominees, including Mr. Abend as the new 
Defense Department inspector general, and 
three current and former Justice Depart-
ment officials to be the new inspectors gen-
eral at the C.I.A., the Education Department 
and the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
Mr. Trump redoubled his attacks on the 
acting inspector general for the Department 
of Health and Human Services, Christi A. 
Grimm, in a statement on Twitter on Tues-
day, a day after she released a report about 
hospitals facing severe shortages in tests as 
they battle the pandemic: 
Why didn’t the I.G., who spent 8 years with 
the Obama Administration (Did she Report 
on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 
17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Ad-
mirals, Generals, V.P. & others in charge, be-
fore doing her report. Another Fake Dos-
sier!—Trump Tweet 
On Monday, Mr. Trump had suggested that 
Ms. Grimm’s report was politically biased 
against him. Ms. Grimm is a career official 
who began work at the inspector general of-
fice late in the Clinton administration and 
stayed there throughout the Bush and 
Obama administrations, taking over the role 
of acting inspector general in an interim ca-
pacity this year. 
Mr. Trump’s interest in inspectors general 
has grown more intense lately. Until his 
most recent nominations, he had failed to 
pick anyone for about one-third of the 37 in-
spector general positions that are presi-
dentially appointed, according to the Project 
on Government Oversight. Those roles were 
temporarily 
assumed 
by 
other 
officials 
whose lack of job security and status typi-
cally makes them more cautious than a per-
manent appointee, government experts say. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
also insert into the RECORD the Presi-
dent’s signing statement, which is 
crystal clear that he is trying to under-
cut oversight. So we need to do our job 
here. 
STATEMENTS & RELEASES 
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT 
(Issued on: March 27, 2020) 
HEALTHCARE 
Today, I have signed into law H.R. 748, the 
‘‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Se-
curity Act’’ or the ‘‘CARES’’ Act (the 
‘‘Act’’). The Act makes emergency supple-
mental appropriations and other changes to 
law to help the Nation respond to the 
coronavirus outbreak. I note, however, that 
the Act includes several provisions that raise 
constitutional concerns. 
Section 15010(c)(3)(B) of Division B of the 
Act purports to require the Chairperson of 
the Council of the Inspectors General on In-
tegrity and Efficiency to consult with mem-
bers of the Congress regarding the selection 
of the Executive Director and Deputy Execu-
tive Director for the newly formed Pandemic 
Response Accountability Committee. The 
Committee is an executive branch entity 
charged with conducting and coordinating 
oversight of the Federal Government’s re-
sponse to the coronavirus outbreak. I antici-
pate that the Chairperson will be able to 
consult with members of the Congress with 
respect to these hiring decisions and will 
welcome their input. But a requirement to 
consult with the Congress regarding execu-
tive decision-making, including with respect 
to the President’s Article II authority to 
oversee executive branch operations, vio-
lates the separation of powers by intruding 
upon the President’s power and duty to su-
pervise the staffing of the executive branch 
under Article II, section 1 (vesting the Presi-
dent with the ‘‘executive Power’’) and Arti-
cle II, section 3 (instructing the President to 
‘‘take Care’’ that the laws are faithfully exe-
cuted). Accordingly, my Administration will 
treat this provision as hortatory but not 
mandatory. 
Section 4018 of Division A of the Act estab-
lishes a new Special Inspector General for 
Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) within the De-
partment of the Treasury to manage audits 
and investigations of loans and investments 
made by the Secretary of the Treasury under 
the Act. Section 4018(e)(4)(B) of the Act au-
thorizes the SIGPR to request information 
from other government agencies and requires 
the SIGPR to report to the Congress ‘‘with-
out delay’’ any refusal of such a request that 
‘‘in the judgment of the Special Inspector 
General’’ is unreasonable. I do not under-
stand, and my Administration will not treat, 
this provision as permitting the SIGPR to 
issue reports to the Congress without the 
presidential supervision required by the 
Take Care Clause, Article II, section 3. 
Certain other provisions (such as sections 
20001, 21007, and 21010 of Division B of the 
Act) purport to condition the authority of 
officers to spend or reallocate funds upon 
consultation with, or the approval of, one or 
more congressional committees. These provi-
sions are impermissible forms of congres-
sional aggrandizement with respect to the 
execution of the laws. The Congress may af-
fect the execution of the laws only by enact-
ing a new statute in accordance with the re-
quirements of bicameralism and present-
ment prescribed in Article I, section 7. My 
Administration will make appropriate ef-
forts to notify the relevant committees be-
fore taking the specified actions and will ac-
cord the recommendations of such commit-
tees all appropriate and serious consider-
ation, but it will not treat spending deci-
sions as dependent on prior consultation 
with or the approval of congressional com-
mittees. 
Finally, several provisions (such as sec-
tions 3511(d)(4) and 3862 (creating section

Cosmetic Act) of Division A of the Act) pur-
port to require recommendations regarding 
legislation to the Congress. Because Article 
II, section 3 gives the President the author-
ity to recommend only ‘‘such Measures as he 
shall judge necessary and expedient,’’ my 
Administration will continue the practice of 
treating provisions like these as advisory 
and non-binding. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE, March 27, 2020. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), the distinguished chair of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of this resolution which estab-
lishes a new select subcommittee on 
the coronavirus within the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform. 
I look forward to working closely 
with the distinguished majority whip 
from South Carolina, Mr. CLYBURN, on 
this very important effort. 
As the Speaker has explained, this 
new subcommittee is modeled directly 
after the Truman committee which 
saved billions of taxpayer dollars dur-
ing World War II and helped mobilize 
our Nation, our industries, and our en-
tire population for war. 
Harry Truman explained at the time 
that it was critical during this effort to 
conduct 
oversight, 
to 
prevent 
the 
waste of taxpayer funds, rather than 
waiting until after they were spent. 
Catching problems early and cor-
recting them immediately saved not 
only money but lives. Today our Na-
tion, our economy, and our people, face 
a similar mobilization effort as we en-
gage 
in 
this 
war 
against 
the 
coronavirus. Microbes are killing more 
people than missiles. 
And let me be clear. Right now, we 
are only in the first battle. This week 
the director of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention warned that we 
could face a second, more deadly wave 
of coronavirus this fall. He warned that 
it could, ‘‘Actually be even more dif-
ficult than the one we just went 
through.’’ 
But our national stockpile is nearly 
depleted. We need protective equip-
ment, we need critical medical sup-
plies, we need tests, and we need new 
vaccines and treatments. We need all 
the supplies and materials necessary 
not only to safeguard our current med-
ical workers but to restore our stock-
piles and to build them up, so we are 
ready for the next battle and the one 
after that and whatever comes next. 
This is something we all should be 
able to agree on. This should be a bi-
partisan effort, and I encourage all of 
my colleagues to come together, to 
protect the interests of the American 
taxpayers, and to promote the most ef-
ficient, effective, equitable, and trans-
parent mobilization in history in re-
sponse to this deadly crisis. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), my good friend and dis-
tinguished member of both the Rules 
Committee and the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, of 
course, we are all observing the At-
tending Physician’s request that we 
stay at least 6 feet apart. And I appre-
ciate the Democratic Speaker’s ac-
knowledgment that it is perhaps better 
to address the American people with-
out a mask. 
Mr. COLE, I also want to extend my 
sympathies to you. I know your dis-
trict suffered greatly last night in the 
storm, and certainly our hearts are 
with our near neighbors in Oklahoma. 
So our actions today represent a lost 
opportunity. I am grateful that we are 
going to finally pass legislation that 
will provide more funding for our small 
businesses and for our healthcare pro-
viders. 
We should have been preparing for 
the needs of the American people since 
the first of this year. Instead, the 
House considered 15 pieces of non-cru-
cial legislation and five resolutions 
that do not now, nor ever will, have the 
force of law. 
Six months before this crisis started 
in January, President Trump signed 
into law the Pandemic and All-Hazards 
Preparedness Act, the product of our 
health subcommittee, last Congress 
and this Congress. 
But after this fire broke out across 
the globe, did we do any real-time over-
sight as to whether or not the bill that 
we had passed, the bill that we had la-
bored over, was, in fact, performing as 
indicated? 
The Speaker talked about real-time 
oversight. We had an opportunity, but 
we didn’t take it. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee held hearings on flavored to-
bacco, we looked into horse racing, we 
looked into ticket scalping. And these 
issues have a place in our legislative 
agenda, but not in the middle of a pan-
demic when we should have been doing 
real-time oversight of a bill we had 
signed into law a mere 6 months before. 
So as the leader of the Health Sub-
committee on Energy and Commerce, I 
began calling for action in January. It 
was not until February 26, as an add-on 
to a budget hearing for Health and 
Human Services where there was a 
brief panel assembled, and only 10 
Members were allowed to ask questions 
of this expert panel on the emerging 
novel coronavirus. 
b 1045 
It was a full 2 weeks later before Con-
gress considered its first comprehen-
sive bill. During consideration in the 
Rules Committee, I requested, because 
one hadn’t been done, a survey of ven-
tilators. We didn’t know how many we 
had available. 
Now, thanks to vital steps taken by 
the Trump administration, to this 
date, no patient has been denied a ven-
tilator that needed one. This is a testa-
ment to the administration’s response. 
It is a testament to the private sector 
in this country that responded so well. 
And it certainly puts to shame the 
Democratic majority’s response during 
January and February. 
We are in the middle of working to 
ensure patient survival and keeping 
our economy afloat. Now is not the 
time to authorize yet another partisan 
committee to conduct oversight in a 
manner that we know will only be good 
for the next new cycle. 
Early in this crisis, we forewent an 
opportunity to prepare. Let us not 
make the same mistake again. Let us 
not continue to waste time. Let us do 
the work of the American people and 
get to business as usual. If we had been 
better authorizers, less oversight would 
be necessary. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise to support the rule and under-
lying legislation to establish the select 
committee, and I also support this bill 
that we will be voting on later today. 
Small businesses are the heart of a 
thriving community and vital to the 
American economy, and there isn’t one 
in Georgia or across the country that 
has not been impacted by the pan-
demic. 
This crisis demands we all continue 
our work together to ensure that our 
American families are kept safe, Amer-
ican small businesses are supported, 
and American workers receive the re-
lief that they need. This funding is one 
more step on the long journey toward 
recovery. 
I want to take this time to offer my 
condolences to the victims who have 
lost their lives to this awful disease. 
My prayers are with those mourning in 
Georgia, across America, and around 
the globe. 
To our doctors, nurses, and first re-
sponders: Americans everywhere are 
looking up to your love, your sacrifice, 
and your uncommon courage. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and 
the underlying bill. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN), my good friend and a dis-
tinguished Member. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, eight different over-
sight processes are in place as we 
speak: 
We have got the Oversight Com-
mittee itself, which has the broadest 
jurisdiction of any committee in Con-
gress to do oversight. 
We have the committees of jurisdic-
tion, which each have a subcommittee 
that does oversight: Ways and Means, 
Energy and Commerce, Small Business, 
and, of course, Financial Services. 
We have the CARES Act itself, which 
created the Oversight Commission in 
the bill itself. 
We have the CARES Act, which also 
created the Pandemic Response Ac-
countability Committee in the bill 
itself. That is the fourth one.

H1916 
April 23, 2020 
The fifth one, we have the IGs, the 
inspectors general from each of the re-
spective agencies: Health and Human 
Services, Treasury. 
Sixth, we have a special inspector 
general created in the CARES Act. 
Seventh, we have $20 million in fund-
ing appropriated in the CARES Act, 
which created a process for auditors 
and experts at GAO to do further over-
sight. 
And finally, eighth, we have the FTC 
and DOJ, the agencies doing oversight 
and holding people accountable for the 
fraud that may be committed. 
Eight different entities doing over-
sight, but the Democrats want a ninth. 
Why? Eight different committees doing 
the work making sure that the hard- 
earned tax dollars of the American peo-
ple have the proper oversight. But we 
need a ninth for what reason? The 
ninth is political. Eight committees 
looking out for the taxpayer, the ninth 
looking out for Joe Biden; the ninth to 
go after President Trump. 
This is just a continuation of the at-
tack that the Democrats have had on 
the President for the past 4 years. It 
started before he was President when 
they opened the Trump Russia inves-
tigation, spied on two American citi-
zens associated with the Trump cam-
paign. It continued with the Mueller 
investigation. And then, of course, we 
had the ridiculous impeachment proc-
ess based on a phone call between the 
President of Ukraine and President 
Trump. 
And now this. Now this, a select com-
mittee in the summer of an election 
year to attack the President when we 
already have eight different entities 
doing the oversight we are all supposed 
to do to look out for the taxpayer in-
terests. 
The Democrats want a ninth because 
the ninth is political, and the ninth 
will be chaired by our colleague, the 
biggest supporter of the Democrats’ 
nominee for President. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD the Guidance for 
Members and Attendees provided to us 
by the Office of the Attending Physi-
cian. 
While face coverings are not manda-
tory, they are certainly recommended. 
The Office of Attending Physician has 
also advised that ‘‘a face cover will 
produce a minimal reduction in sound 
when using a microphone. The face 
covering is likely to be most useful in 
preventing viral spread while a person 
is speaking.’’ 
So people can do whatever they want 
to do, but I would say, while we are all 
trying to show how fearless we are, we 
should be mindful of the people sur-
rounding us. So until I am advised oth-
erwise, I am going to keep my mask 
on. 
GUIDANCE FOR MEMBERS AND ATTENDEES 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON RULES 
In order to accommodate this meeting of 
the House Committee on Rules, the following 
guidelines have been developed in consulta-
tion with the Office of the Attending Physi-
cian (OAP), the Office of the Sergeant at 
Arms (SAA), and the Committee on House 
Administration. The OAP continues to rec-
ommend teleworking for all Congressional 
offices and that Members and staff maintain 
6-foot social distance spacing as much as 
practicable when in the offices or the Cap-
itol. 
The OAP, in conjunction with guidance 
from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, recommends that all Members 
and attendees should: 
1. Avoid congregating in groups upon ar-
rival to the room; 
2. Use provided hand sanitizer; 
3. Apply a face cover if a face covering is 
not already worn (a face cover will be avail-
able for those who need them); 
4. Proceed directly to their seat, maintain-
ing proper distancing; and 
5. Remain seated until the conclusion of 
the meeting, to the extent possible. 
Use of a face covering, while voluntary, is 
recommended for this specific proceeding 
due to occasions when the six-foot separa-
tion distance may be not be possible (Mem-
ber private communications with staff, docu-
ment distribution if needed, witness or staff 
movements, etc.). 
The OAP has advised that a face cover will 
produce a minimal reduction in sound when 
using a microphone. The face covering is 
likely to be most useful in preventing viral 
spread while a person is speaking. 
Members are encouraged to attend without 
staff or to limit themselves to a maximum of 
one staff person per Member if necessary. 
Staff who do accompany their bosses are re-
quested to sit in the audience and only ap-
proach the dais if/when needed. 
Members and attendees should not engage 
in personal greetings such as handshakes or 
embraces. 
Members and attendees are asked to re-
spect markings present on chairs to prevent 
their 
use, 
in 
accordance 
with 
social 
distancing guidelines. 
Access restrictions to the Capitol Complex 
remain in place. Per guidance from the SAA, 
House Office Buildings remain open to Mem-
bers, Congressional staff, and credentialed 
press. 
When the meeting is adjourned, departure 
from the room should continue to respect so-
cial distancing by avoiding congregating in 
groups near the exit doors, hallways, or ele-
vators. Members and attendees should use 
waterless hand cleansing upon exit after re-
moving and disposing of their face covering. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this resolution. It is sad to say, but 
this coronavirus pandemic has caused 
some of the greatest suffering in our 
time for individuals and for our coun-
try at large. And yet there are those 
few who would see this as an oppor-
tunity to benefit for themselves and 
their companies by price gouging or, 
one might say, pandemic profiteering. 
We have good reason to be skeptical 
about many of these companies, includ-
ing the pharmaceutical industry. For 
example, even during this crisis, we 
saw Gilead seek and receive from the 
FDA 7 years of orphan drug exclusivity 
for a possible treatment for the virus. 
Only after organizations stepped in and 
protested did Gilead go back to the 
FDA to withdraw their request. 
Do we really need an oversight com-
mittee? Look what has happened al-
ready. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Headlines such 
as a $55 million contract to a bankrupt 
company, who is a baker, in order to 
make N95 masks. 
‘‘Hedge 
Fund 
Managers 
Claiming 
Bailouts As Small Businesses.’’ 
‘‘Over 43,000 U.S. Millionaires Will 
Get ‘stimulus’ Averaging $1.6 Million 
Each.’’ 
Yes, we need an oversight committee, 
and we need it now. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER), my good friend and 
a distinguished gentleman. 
Mr. 
COMER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Americans are suffering right now. 
Hospitals, families, and businesses are 
figuring out what their next step will 
be. 
But, instead of helping American 
families, Speaker PELOSI wants to set 
up a new, costly, unnecessary select 
committee. This is an outrageous at-
tempt to yet again use Congress to 
smear President Trump in an election 
year, just like the impeachment cha-
rade a few months ago. 
I am all about oversight. We already 
have an Oversight Committee that is 
tasked with carrying out these very 
duties, and it is a very good com-
mittee, a quality committee made up 
of outstanding members from both 
sides of the aisle. 
This is yet another political game 
from Speaker PELOSI using tax dollars 
for political gain. Creating a new select 
committee is completely redundant. 
We must stop these games and, instead, 
focus on the real problems facing the 
American people. 
Creating an entirely new select com-
mittee is an irresponsible waste of time 
and resources that could be used else-
where. Let’s refocus on getting this 
country back on track and moving for-
ward for the American people. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
when it comes to $2 trillion, I don’t 
think there can be enough oversight. I 
think our constituents expect us to 
make sure that that money is being 
spent where it should be spent, where 
Congress intended it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 
underlying bill, which was made much 
safer to save lives and to provide eco-
nomic opportunity. But, as well, I rise 
to support the bipartisan, as it should 
be, oversight bill created by the vision 
of our Speaker, and I ask my col-
leagues to understand what oversight

H1917 
April 23, 2020 
is in COVID–19. It is to save lives and 
to make sure that we focus on the 
needs of those like the elderly in nurs-
ing homes who need to be tested or es-
sential workers. 
Or we find out the underlying incom-
petence, if you will, of large companies 
getting money from the mom-and-pop 
businesses. That needs oversight. 
Or we promote more testing, like the 
$25 billion that is in the underlying 
bill, and contact tracing. That is what 
oversight is. 
Oversight is to maintain the idea 
that we have responsibility for the 
budget of this Nation, but we have the 
responsibility for the lives of this Na-
tion. 
I served as a staffer for the Select 
Committee on Assassinations when 
people were in dismay about the assas-
sinations of Dr. King and John F. Ken-
nedy. I will tell you that even that 
small committee in the House gave 
some comfort that Congress was caring 
about lives and about our budget. 
I support enthusiastically the rule 
and, as well, the bipartisan Oversight 
Committee. Wise people will know that 
Congress must continue to do its work 
in a way that saves lives and strength-
ens our economy. 
I ask support for this bill and the 
rule. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. FERGUSON), my good friend 
and the distinguished chief deputy 
whip of the Republican Conference. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, here we go again. 
Once again you are about to do what 
America doesn’t want. 
We just came from our districts 
where we have been solving problems 
with our constituents, helping them 
through a very, very difficult time, 
working to make sure that they had 
funding through the PPP loan pro-
gram, working to make sure that our 
hospitals had the supplies that they 
needed. 
I hoped there would be a sense of co-
operation and shared stories of good 
things that were going on back in our 
district, despite the hard times. I had 
hoped that those commonalities from 
all congressional districts could be the 
shared stories that we built a new 
sense of cooperation on. But, no. You 
all seem to be like a bird dog pointing 
at a quail. You just can’t help your-
selves. 
First of all, you had Russia, then im-
peachment, and now the coronavirus. 
You just can’t do it. And you will say— 
I have heard it already—that this will 
not be partisan, that this is needed 
work. Needed more than eight commit-
tees that are already out there? Well, I 
can tell you this will be partisan, being 
led by an individual who is the Demo-
cratic nominee’s number one sup-
porter. 
And I will tell you this: I am willing 
to bet just about everything I have got 
that this will be nothing more than a 
partisan hack job; and if it is not, I will 
be the first one to apologize and happy 
to buy the Speaker a pint of her favor-
ite ice cream. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to remind my colleagues, one of 
our constitutional responsibilities is 
oversight. We just appropriated over $2 
trillion, and I applaud the Speaker of 
the House for making sure that this 
Congress does its job and does proper 
oversight. 
I don’t know about their constitu-
ents, but my constituents are puzzled 
why some of the money that was de-
signed to go to small businesses ended 
up going to these megabusinesses like 
Shake Shack or Ruth’s Chris Steak 
House, so they want accountability. 
Two trillion dollars, I mean, is that 
too much to ask? So I applaud the 
Speaker of the House for focusing us on 
making sure that we do our job, but we 
do oversight. This select committee is 
warranted, it is important, and I think 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
should 
overwhelmingly support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS), my good 
friend and a distinguished member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. I appreciate his 
leadership. 
I rise in opposition to this select 
committee. Energy and Commerce has 
a long tradition of bipartisan oversight 
in its broad jurisdiction and has the 
tools to prevent any fraud, waste, or 
abuse. 
In the Consumer Protection and 
Commerce 
Subcommittee, 
we 
are 
working right now, Republicans and 
Democrats, to make sure the FTC is 
protecting Americans from bad actors 
who are using the coronavirus to com-
mit fraud. Our Oversight and Investiga-
tion team is working around the clock 
to stop bad actors and to track the 
spread of the virus itself, as well as the 
stockpiles of PPE, ventilators, and test 
kits sent to the States. 
Our Health Subcommittee is working 
with HHS, FDA, CDC, and NIH to en-
sure resources reach hospitals and 
frontline healthcare workers who need 
it most. 
The same can be said for the Small 
Business and Financial Services Com-
mittees’ efforts to ensure that PPP 
loans are implemented effectively. 
There is also the Ways and Means 
Committee oversight of the economic 
impact payments or any of a number of 
other committees involved in Congress’ 
unprecedented bipartisan response to 
this crisis. 
b 1100 
This select committee duplicates the 
existing jurisdiction of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and others. It 
will erode the trust and effectiveness in 
our work that is underway during the 
greatest healthcare and economic cri-
sis we have seen in our lifetime. 
We shouldn’t create a new committee 
that will divide us, make this response 
partisan, create more bureaucracy in 
Congress, and undermine the hard, bi-
partisan work of my colleagues and 
staff who are doing their jobs on their 
committees already. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to let 
our committees continue to do their 
jobs and reject this resolution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, we 
are waiting for a couple of other speak-
ers. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. HICE), my good friend. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, in a very short pe-
riod of time, this body has moved an 
unprecedented amount of money at an 
unprecedented speed, and rather than 
taking a step back now and looking at 
the effectiveness of what we have im-
plemented so far, here we are today 
rushing forward, not only with addi-
tional funds, but also to rig up an un-
necessary and duplicative select sub-
committee for the purpose of inves-
tigating the President of the United 
States. Make no mistake. That is the 
purpose of this subcommittee. 
It is entirely political in nature, de-
signed to influence the 2020 elections. 
From the moment it is gaveled into 
life, there is no question that the mis-
sion will be to prevent the reelection of 
President Donald Trump. 
There are already eight real over-
sight and watchdog processes in this 
body. Eight. 
The Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee, of which I am a member, has 
the broadest jurisdiction in this body, 
and we have the power and the experi-
ence needed to oversee any Federal 
coronavirus response. 
So why does the Speaker want a 
ninth? Why are we here looking at a 
ninth oversight subcommittee, espe-
cially when the Democrats are already 
in charge of the eight that we already 
have? Why would the appointment of 
this new select subcommittee be a 
member of her own leadership team 
who has already publicly stated that 
this virus creates for the Democrats a 
tremendous opportunity to restructure 
things to fit their vision? 
That makes it clear what the purpose 
of this is all about: it is because this is 
an election year, it is because they 
hate the President of the United 
States, and because of that, I strongly 
encourage my colleagues to reject this 
resolution, which is intended to create 
an un-needed and duplicative com-
mittee. 
Madam Chair, I again thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1918 
April 23, 2020 
We are still waiting for a couple of 
additional speakers but let me just say 
one thing here again. It is hard to be-
lieve what we are hearing here. 
My friends on one hand are telling 
the American people that we all care 
deeply about oversight, we all want to 
make sure that the money is being 
spent properly, but yet they are op-
posed to this. 
It is $2 trillion that we have re-
sponded with to try to deal with the 
crisis that we are faced with. That is a 
lot of money. To object to a select 
committee to basically make sure that 
it is being spent properly as this thing 
is unfolding, my colleagues have such a 
difficult time dealing with that. 
Madam Speaker, again, I applaud the 
Speaker of the House for her leadership 
during this pandemic, not only on this, 
but on a whole range of other issues. 
She has taken what my Republican 
friends in the Senate and what the 
White House has proposed and made it 
better and made it more responsive to 
average working people. 
That is what this is about: making 
sure the money gets to the people who 
need it, not to the people who don’t 
need it, not to the big corporations, 
not to the well-off or the well con-
nected. 
So I don’t understand all of the hand- 
wringing over this select committee. 
This is an important select committee, 
just like the one that then-Senator 
Truman did to make sure that the 
moneys that were appropriated went to 
help win the war. 
We want to win this war too. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
a quick response to my friend. 
I recall that we requested oversight 
committees for TARP. That was not al-
lowed by then-Speaker PELOSI. We re-
quested oversight committees for the 
stimulus package in 2009. That, too, 
was not agreed to by Speaker PELOSI. 
So we find this new need for oversight 
refreshing, but somewhat questionable. 
Madam Speaker, I also remind my 
friend, there are eight existing com-
mittees, all of which, by the way, the 
Democrats control, all of which they 
chair. 
We have confidence in the eight ex-
isting committees to do their job. We 
don’t see the need for a ninth. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK), my great friend. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
when we passed the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, I warned that serious 
flaws would deliver a windfall to busi-
nesses that did not need it at the ex-
pense of those that do. That is exactly 
what happened, exhausting the fund 
within days. 
Now it is imperative to replenish this 
program to assure that small busi-
nesses that desperately need these 
funds receive them. 
Now, this could have been done 2 
weeks ago but for the Democrats’ de-
mands that wasted time and added 
costs. 
I supported the CARES Act only be-
cause I believed a better bill could not 
be produced given the current major-
ity. 
For the same reason, I support the 
bill to be taken up later today, but 
with this grave warning: unprecedented 
and 
unconstitutional 
government 
edicts have deliberately destroyed the 
livelihoods of millions of Americans 
and have set in motion both an eco-
nomic depression and government in-
solvencies that threaten the very sur-
vival of our Nation. They must end 
now. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS). 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, 4 
weeks ago we passed the largest eco-
nomic rescue in American history. 
Today we replenish some of its most 
important programs. 
Behind each program are real people 
in 
desperate 
need 
of 
our 
help: 
healthcare workers and hospitals in 
dire need of support, supplies, and test-
ing; 
Small 
business 
owners 
agonizing 
amid uncertainty and boxed out of 
loans by big banks serving well-con-
nected clients; and 
Our family farmers who continue to 
feed the world under unprecedented 
hardship, unable to qualify for the dis-
aster loans afforded to others. 
Today’s 
legislation 
rights 
these 
wrongs. It also harnesses the help of 
our community banks and our credit 
unions, but it does not go far enough. 
Our cities, our States need assistance 
now. They soon may have to lay off po-
lice and first responders, the very peo-
ple we need on the front lines in this 
crisis. 
Our corn growers and ethanol pro-
ducers deserve the same help afforded 
Big Oil. We must take care of them in 
this next relief package. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT), my very good friend. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), for yielding, and 
I am greatly sorry for the losses yes-
terday, as well as down in BRIAN 
BABIN’s district. 
I heard the Speaker say we need to 
move in a bipartisan manner, and I be-
lieve she meant that. But then I can’t 
forget that she said the same thing 
about impeachment a year ago: we 
can’t move forward with impeachment 
unless it is bipartisan. 
So what are we doing first? We are 
going to have a vote to create another 
oversight committee. So apparently 
the answer the Democrats have is if 
you have got eight committees that 
aren’t doing their job, we have the an-
swer: another committee. 
For heaven’s sake, we have got peo-
ple losing their businesses, they are 
isolated. 
Humans are social animals; we like 
to be around other people. 
There are suicides, like in Knox 
County, Tennessee: they have lost 
more 
people 
to 
suicide 
than 
the 
coronavirus. 
We have got to be careful about 
spreading fear. We can be concerned, 
but we shouldn’t be afraid. 
But another committee? For heav-
en’s sake, that is not what we need. 
It is interesting that the answer the 
Democrats have to potential waste, 
fraud, and abuse is to create another 
wasteful committee. 
Just make the committees we have 
do their job of oversight, and then we 
will be all right. There needs to be 
oversight. 
We apparently need a committee to 
give oversight to the oversight com-
mittees, because they are not doing 
their job, and that is why we need a 
new one. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am absolutely stunned over the out-
rage to sunshine and oversight. Give 
me a break. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
THOMPSON). 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this isn’t the bill I 
would have written. I am incredibly 
frustrated that Senate Republicans 
stalled negotiations without offering 
any fixes to help get money into the 
hands of the small businesses that are 
hardest hit. 
Funding needs to get to legitimate 
small 
businesses 
quickly 
and 
effi-
ciently, not to big corporations. 
Senate 
Republicans 
also 
rejected 
funding to help support State and local 
governments that are on the tip of the 
spear in fighting this pandemic. 
With your help, Madam Speaker, we 
did get some improvements in this bill, 
such as additional funding for hospitals 
and testing to help respond to this cri-
sis so we can eventually reopen our 
country, and improvements to the PPP 
and the EIDL program, which were cru-
cial. 
Times are uncertain and people in 
my district are hurting. They need re-
lief now. 
I will support this bill, but I look for-
ward to future packages to get the 
needed relief to our communities that 
need it the most. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BASS). 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, a few 
days after the last bill became law, sto-
ries began to surface of an extreme dis-
proportionate death rate among Afri-
can Americans in several cities, with a 
70 percent death rate, while African 
Americans are only 20 to 30 percent of 
the population. 
Some cite underlying health condi-
tions as the reason for the extreme dis-
proportionate death rate, as though 
this is a reason that nothing can be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1919 
April 23, 2020 
done, as though we have to just accept 
this for now. 
This bill begins the process of ad-
dressing the disproportionate death 
rate, but oversight and advocacy from 
Congress and the public will still be 
needed. 
The bill calls for a report to be issued 
in 21 days, where we should have a bet-
ter picture of what is happening and, 
hopefully, provide a roadmap. 
The bill calls for reporting data on 
demographics including race, on the 
number and rates of cases, hospitaliza-
tion, and deaths from COVID. 
When the report is made public, it 
will be clear that communities with 
large African American populations 
will require focused and concentrated 
testing with rapid results, that contact 
tracing and early and aggressive treat-
ment will be required, and that hos-
pitals should reevaluate how they 
make decisions regarding who has ac-
cess to ventilators. 
Using formulas that decide based on 
who they believe has a better chance of 
survival will undoubtedly hurt African 
Americans and contribute to the dis-
proportionate death rate. 
When we gather again to pass an-
other bill, we must include targeted re-
sources that support aggressive inter-
ventions. 
It is just not acceptable for the rich-
est country in the history of the world 
to allow different populations to suffer 
like they don’t even live in the United 
States but live in countries without 
the resources to protect its population. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
(Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues 
in support of this rule. It will continue 
urgent support for our small busi-
nesses, hospitals, and healthcare pro-
viders on the front line. 
Madam Speaker, I want to commend 
the House leadership for ensuring that 
this agreement, which includes the 
agreement that we will pass later on 
today, includes $120 million more in 
small business relief that the Senate 
initially wanted to provide. 
I am pleased to see that we will in-
clude SBA disaster loan programs and 
other provisions for extra support for 
small businesses. 
The dynamic work of the members of 
the House leadership have been hard 
fought for those forgotten, and I have a 
great concern that without the select 
committee, the implementation of the 
incredible work will not be done. 
Reporting requirements holding this 
administration to task are important 
for those that have been forgotten, for 
people like those in the Virgin Islands 
and for those who have been dispropor-
tionately affected by this law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the rule. 
b 1115 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
CLARK), my good friend. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
with 
the 
Second 
World War raging, Eleanor Roosevelt 
noted that: ‘‘When all is said and done, 
and the statesmen discuss the future of 
the world, the fact remains that people 
fight these wars.’’ 
The war on the pandemic is being 
waged in our crowded hospitals, our 
empty classrooms, and our closed busi-
nesses. Today’s bill will bring Ameri-
cans desperately needed relief, and I 
am deeply grateful for the victories 
that Democrats secured. 
But the pandemic has exposed the 
deep income, racial, and health dispari-
ties as it cuts a lethal path through our 
communities. And it has exposed the 
callous and deadly indifference of the 
protectors of the wealthy and the con-
nected all too willing to sacrifice our 
neighbors for the bottom line. 
But in this House, the people’s 
House, we know that our strength and 
our recovery as a nation rests in the 
health and prosperity of all Americans, 
and we will fight with everything we 
have for the people. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. FUDGE). 
Ms. 
FUDGE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I wonder when this 
administration will treat all of its citi-
zens with the same concern. Yes, our 
small businesses need additional sup-
port and our hospitals, too, but big 
banks should not have access to any 
more money because they have really 
already taken care of all of their 
friends. 
I am happy our farmers are being 
helped, but what about hungry people? 
The USDA has decided to buy meat and 
produce, put it in a box, and send it to 
the unemployed through food banks. 
Why not just increase SNAP benefits 
as we have requested? 
When is the right time to fight for 
teachers and sanitation workers, po-
lice, fire, and EMS? 
When do we ensure prisoners are safe 
and are afforded appropriate care? 
When do we provide nursing homes 
with adequate resources? 
When do we guarantee every child 
has access to distance learning? 
When is it the right time to fight for 
those who can’t afford to pay 2 or 3 
months’ rent at once? 
Most Americans don’t have the lux-
ury of waiting for us to pick and 
choose who gets help. We keep saying 
it will be in the next bill. Our people 
need it now. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, first of all, let me just say I 
rise in support of this package. I want 
to thank the Speaker; our leadership 
committee chair; members of the Con-
gressional 
Black 
Caucus, 
including 
Chairwoman BASS; Chairwoman KELLY, 
chair of the Health Braintrust; and all 
of the Members and staff who are work-
ing together on the health provisions 
of this bill. 
Also, let me just take this moment 
to thank our essential workers for 
their sacrifices during this horrific 
pandemic. 
Evidence has piled up that Black and 
Brown people are bearing some of the 
worst burdens of COVID. This bill re-
quires, as Chairwoman BASS said, the 
CDC to get us the data on which com-
munities are bearing the worst brunt 
and then to make sure that testing is 
focused on these communities. 
But let me just say, we have much 
more work to do. Too many people 
were trapped in poverty before this cri-
sis, and now more people have been 
pushed into the ranks of the poor be-
cause of COVID. People are lining up in 
front of food banks. 
We need to increase SNAP funding, 
support the State and local govern-
ment workers who are on the front 
lines of this crisis, protect our elec-
tions, and help people who are falling 
through the cracks and living on the 
edge. We have a moral and we have a 
patriotic duty to do this. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I want to begin by 
thanking my friend and the Rules Com-
mittee as a committee and the staff. 
We met last night. Obviously, we are 
all meeting now at an extraordinary 
time, a very difficult time. 
I was very proud of our committee 
last night, particularly our chairman 
and our staff for reopening and func-
tioning and producing a contentious 
item, but a worthy item, to discuss 
here today. So thank you to Mr. Chair-
man for his leadership, and I thank our 
staff and thank our fellow members of 
the committee. 
And I want to thank the body, in-
cluding the Speaker. We are here today 
functioning. Obviously, we are taking 
precautions. Obviously, we are doing 
things differently. We are a little bit 
out of our comfort zone as a body. This 
isn’t the way we normally work. But 
the point is we are here in Washington, 
D.C., and we are working. 
While we disagree very strongly over 
this particular piece of legislation, 
later today we will vote in over-
whelming bipartisan numbers for an-
other relief package, Madam Speaker, 
for the American people. 
That is the fourth time in a row that 
we have done it, and we have done it 
without 
partisanship. 
That 
doesn’t 
mean there wasn’t hard bargaining. It 
doesn’t mean that everybody got ev-
erything they wanted in the package.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1920 
April 23, 2020 
Quite the opposite. Everybody gave up 
some things that they wanted. But at 
the end of the day, we did come to-
gether. 
Now, personally, I wish we would 
have put money earlier in the Pay-
check Protection Program, but I cer-
tainly don’t begrudge the additional 
money for hospitals and testing. So, 
hopefully, we can avoid that and keep 
programs that are working going, fine- 
tune them where we must. 
There are certainly some changes 
that could be made. But I think, on 
balance, we ought to look back and 
say, at a time of great crisis, Congress 
has continued to function and has 
come together in a bipartisan manner 
and has done important work on behalf 
of the American people. 
We have a lot more important work 
to do. There are many, many chal-
lenges that are going to confront us. 
Secretary Mnuchin sometimes calls 
the response to coronavirus a baseball 
game with nine innings. And I suspect 
that we are completing the fourth in-
ning today, Madam Speaker, with the 
ultimate passage of the additional re-
sources for the CARES Act. 
Again, while we disagree on this 
one—I want to talk about that in a sec-
ond—we agree on the most important 
act of the day, which is getting relief 
out the door to the American people 
and sustaining our economy under a 
time of great stress, helping our 
healthcare workers who are on the 
front line, trying to make sure we have 
the robust testing that is necessary so 
our Governors can make good decisions 
when they grapple with the tough issue 
of how they are to reopen their respec-
tive States. 
We think, Madam Speaker, the par-
ticular item we are considering this 
morning is simply unnecessary. We 
have eight oversight committees, all of 
which, I remind my friends, they con-
trol. They are the majority in this 
body. That is appropriate. They are 
their oversight committees. 
Creating another one we just think 
is, at a minimum, superfluous; and, 
frankly, history has taught us it is 
more apt to be a weapon, in our view, 
used to attack the President of the 
United States relentlessly during an 
election year. I would love to be wrong 
about that. As my friend Mr. FERGUSON 
said he would be the first to apologize, 
I will be happy to apologize, too, if I 
am wrong. 
But, even if that were not the case, I 
would question the need for an addi-
tional committee. I simply don’t see 
any need for that. We have committees 
that do this. We have committees that 
have a lot of experience in doing this. 
And, frankly, we have committees that 
have done it in a pretty bipartisan way 
in the past. So I would hope we would 
rely on those committees. 
With that, Madam Speaker, I again 
thank my friend for the debate and 
thank his side for the spirited partici-
pation, but I urge rejection of this par-
ticular measure, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend, Mr. COLE—and he is my friend. 
I appreciate all of his counsel and ad-
vice in the Rules Committee, and I ap-
preciate his respect for this institu-
tion. 
I want to thank the distinguished 
Speaker of this House for her leader-
ship. This is a moment in history that 
demands strong leadership, and she has 
risen to the occasion, and I applaud her 
and I appreciate that. 
I also want to thank all of those who 
work on the Hill here: the Capitol Po-
lice, the Sergeant at Arms, the attend-
ing physician, the chief administrative 
officer, and all of the people who main-
tain this incredible building. I want to 
thank them. They protect us and they 
do an unbelievable job. 
Madam Speaker, I want to remind 
people that more than 855,000 cases of 
coronavirus 
have 
been 
confirmed. 
Nearly 48,000 lives have been lost as of 
today, more than 22 million initial un-
employment claims filed in the past 
month. Families will be changed for-
ever. We are in a crisis, and we should 
be proud that we have come together 
repeatedly in a bipartisan way to move 
legislation forward to respond to that 
crisis. 
Now, over $2 trillion we have ap-
proved to try to help our constituents, 
protect them, and help protect small 
businesses, but that is just part of our 
job. Our job is not just to appropriate 
the money and just hope it goes to 
wherever it is supposed to go. We need 
to do the oversight. We need to make 
sure that every single penny that we 
have appropriated goes to where it 
needs to go. 
I don’t want to be here a year from 
now looking back and saying: Oh, look 
at all of the waste and all of the abuse. 
Look at all of the well-connected peo-
ple who benefited, but look at all the 
people who needed the funds who 
didn’t. 
We need to get this right. That is 
what this select committee is about. 
This should not be controversial. 
Again, I am stunned by the resist-
ance to sunshine and transparency. 
That is what this is about, and I hope 
and pray that everything goes per-
fectly. 
But 
we 
cannot 
take 
that 
chance. We have to make sure we live 
up to our constitutional responsibility. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote for 
this rule so that we can establish this 
select committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time, and I move the pre-
vious question on the resolution. 
The previous question was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair

today on motions to suspend the rules

PERMISSION TO EXTEND DEBATE 
TIME ON H.R. 266 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that debate under 
clause 1(c) of rule XV on a motion to 
suspend the rules relating to the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 266 be extended 
to 2 hours. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of today, 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) and the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BRADY) each will control 60 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are here today in 
these very trying and unprecedented 
times to act on an emergency interim 
funding package that I am pleased has 
strong bipartisan support. But we did 
not arrive here without significant ef-
forts by our Democratic colleagues. 
When we began negotiations with the 
Senate, we were presented with an in-
sufficient proposal that did not address 
the public health crisis that has now 
claimed the lives of nearly 48,000 Amer-
icans. The measures that we fought for 
will now bring real relief to the Amer-
ican people and prioritizes resources to 
combat this virus. This means more 
funding for hospitals and healthcare 
workers. It also means resources des-
ignated for testing. 
I am encouraged that the administra-
tion has committed to a national test-
ing strategy which will be necessary to 
reopen our economy. We are all pain-
fully aware that the American people 
are worried about their health, their 
jobs, the economy, and what life will 
look like after the emergency subsides. 
It is our responsibility to give our com-
munities the confidence that we will 
get through this crisis, and that, even-
tually, we will return to normal lives. 
To do this, we must protect our small 
businesses on Main Street, and that is 
why we fought to increase funding for 
the Paycheck Protection Program and 
target the funds to community-based 
lenders, 
small 
banks, 
and 
credit 
unions. The legislation before us today 
is a marked improvement from where 
the Senate majority started, but I 
want to be clear: This does not come 
close to addressing the staggering 
needs of the American family. That is 
why my fellow chairs and I have al-
ready begun working on COVID four. 
Our next legislative package must be 
grounded in the understanding that re-
starting our economy can only happen 
when Americans are healthy and have 
the confidence to return to work. For 
our part, the Committee on Ways and 
Means will prioritize funding for hos-
pitals and assistance for those on the 
front lines—and I know Mr. BRADY 
agrees with us on that—as we proceed. 
In addition, our State and local gov-
ernments 
are 
feeling 
the 
pain 
of 
slashed revenue from this pandemic. 
Without our support, essential workers 
who have been risking their lives are at 
risk of losing their jobs. 
Finally, we must look at what the 
most vulnerable in our country are fac-
ing by putting money into their pock-
ets with another round of stimulus 
payments so they can pay for essen-
tials. Similarly, we need to extend Fed-
eral unemployment compensation into 
the fall and help take the pressure off 
of overwhelmed State governments at 
the moment. 
Since this crisis began, Members and 
staff have made Herculean efforts to 
address the challenges we are now fac-
ing. We still have much work to do to 
ensure that we put the needs of our 
neighbors first, and we need to ac-
knowledge—and I know Mr. BRADY 
feels as I do—the work of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means’ staffers in 
bringing us to this moment. Together, 
we will rise to this challenge. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
coronavirus 
launched an unprecedented attack on 
Americans’ health in the best economy 
our Nation has experienced in decades. 
America responded with an unprece-
dented effort to contain the virus, led

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1924 
April 23, 2020 
by President Trump and the healthcare 
community. Congress responded by 
working with the President to deliver 
not one, not two, but three bipartisan 
measures to combat the health and 
economic damage of COVID–19. 
The battle continues amidst signs 
that in some regions we are flattening 
the curve and beginning to reopen the 
economy safely as health conditions on 
the ground permit. This fourth bill re-
plenishes the crucial help for Main 
Street businesses and local healthcare 
providers, while devoting more re-
sources to producing more tests and 
distributing them more quickly. 
It adds $320 billion in crucial funding 
to the Paycheck Protection Program 
to help keep our local businesses 
afloat. It boosts funding for local 
healthcare providers by another $75 bil-
lion. It expands our States’ testing ca-
pacities and ensures more resources for 
our Nation-wide effort to continue 
locking down this virus. It is targeted. 
It will have an immediate impact, and 
it deserves strong bipartisan support. 
Once President Trump signed the 
CARES Act into law merely 4 weeks 
ago, then moved with historic speed to 
provide forgivable loans to small busi-
nesses, it soon became clear more dol-
lars are needed to keep workers on 
local payrolls. 
So far, the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram is helping nearly 1.6 million local 
businesses, impacting and helping save 
30 million jobs for local construction, 
retail, manufacturing, healthcare, hos-
pitality, and service businesses. De-
spite media portrayals, the average 
loan is around $200,000—that is Main 
Street—and more often than not, it is 
provided by a community bank. These 
dollars are reaching small businesses. 
And when funding ran out, Republicans 
and President Trump urged Congress to 
quickly replenish them. 
b 1145 
It 
is 
unfortunate 
that 
Speaker 
PELOSI
decided to hold up this bill 
nearly 16 days while small businesses 
and their workers desperately fought 
to hold on, especially minority-owned 
businesses 
in 
underserved 
commu-
nities. They suffered, and during this 
unnecessary delay, America’s jobless 
numbers climbed to 26 million. 
How many jobs could we have saved 
if partisan politics had not reared its 
ugly head? 
This emergency funding is just that; 
it is funding. It doesn’t adjust the de-
sign of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram nor does it address the flawed un-
employment design that pays some 
Americans more than they make at 
work. It takes what is working for 
businesses and healthcare providers 
and replenishes it, which is why it has 
earned the support of a number of orga-
nizations like the American Hospital 
Association and the National Federa-
tion of Independent Business. 
Today’s bill makes it possible for 
families to stay connected to their 
work. Local businesses can keep their 
lights on. And once we get to the other 
end of this, we will return to a safe, 
healthy America for our seniors, our 
children, and our grandchildren. 
I will conclude with this: The Presi-
dent is right. We can continue to apply 
maximum pressure on the coronavirus 
while reopening our economy safely 
and responsibly. Not only can we, we 
must, if we hope to prevent hurting 
working families and the jobless with 
an unnecessarily extended economic 
recession marked by shortages of need-
ed day-to-day supplies and serious 
healthcare problems created by long- 
term unemployment. 
This isn’t a choice between lives and 
livelihoods. We must do both. With the 
President, State and local leaders, 
healthcare providers, and local busi-
nesses all working together, I am con-
vinced we can. 
How? The way we tackle every adver-
sity our Nation has faced: with Amer-
ican ingenuity, know-how, and com-
mon sense. 
Today, we help our small businesses 
and healthcare heroes. Tomorrow, Con-
gress and President Trump will con-
tinue to work together to identify 
practical ways to help businesses cre-
ate safe, healthy workplaces, jump- 
start this economic rebound, and accel-
erate a return to work for those who 
are jobless or furloughed. I urge all my 
colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), whose career has 
been marked by a steadfast determina-
tion to expand healthcare coverage for 
all members of the American family 
and continues to be a champion for the 
least, the last, and the lost, who are 
feeling part of the grip of this pan-
demic. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for managing this impor-
tant legislation on the floor of the 
House. I also commend him for the 
work that he did in the previous legis-
lation that we have had. 
As has been acknowledged, this is the 
fourth bipartisan bill that we have 
brought to the floor to address the 
coronavirus pandemic, and this is a 
very important piece of legislation. 
So we come to the floor with such 
heartache, with such sorrow for those 
who have lost their lives and for their 
loved ones, for those who are suffering 
from the virus assault now, and for 
those who are in doubt about their eco-
nomic situation. It is about the lives 
and the livelihood of the American peo-
ple; that is what this is about. 
Nearly 900,000 Americans have been 
diagnosed and are sick. Nearly 50,000 
have tragically died. Oh, my goodness. 
We have to be prayerful, prayerful 
about this assault again on the lives 
and livelihoods of the American people. 
Countless hospitals and healthcare 
systems remain swamped with cases, 
and far too many frontline workers 
still do not have the personal protec-
tive equipment that they need. 
And just this morning, we learned 
that more than 4 million workers filed 
for unemployment last week, with 
more than 26 million having lost their 
jobs during this pandemic so far. 
So, as we work to protect the Amer-
ican people, we have to make decisions. 
We recognize that the key to opening 
up our economy, the key to opening 
that door, the threshold we must cross, 
is a scientific one: testing, testing, 
testing, testing; contact tracing; isola-
tion; of course, treatment; and, best of 
all, prevention. But the key is sci-
entific, and we must make our decision 
in that way. 
So here we are, and I say this in 
terms of the overarching. The Amer-
ican people have told us, when we did 
our earlier bill, they do not want any 
taxpayer dollars going to enriching 
shareholders, dividends, bonuses, CEO 
pay, all of that. They want their tax-
payer dollars to keep people in their 
jobs. 
The oversight of that is exactly what 
we passed, we will pass—we passed by 
voice vote earlier, we will vote on 
later. That is very important. It is very 
important to the American people to 
have confidence, as they make their 
sacrifices, that their taxpayer dollars 
that they pay are not being squan-
dered. 
Our colleagues have said: Why do we 
need oversight? We have all these com-
mittees that do oversight—and I hope 
they will—but they have other work to 
do as well. 
And as the Republicans have put 
forth select committees themselves— 
Benghazi; trying to destroy Planned 
Parenthood, which did not have any ur-
gency for the American people—this 
has an urgency to the American people. 
We need a select committee whose 
focus, whose purpose is to address the 
challenge that the coronavirus places 
on us. That is one. 
Two, the American people want their 
checks. They want their checks, and 
that is what we are doing with the PPP 
and the direct payments and other ini-
tiatives that are there, and we need to 
do more. 
And third, and we haven’t done 
enough in this regard, they want our 
heroes, our healthcare providers, our 
police and fire, our first responders, 
our emergency services folks, our tran-
sit people, everyone, our food service 
folks, they want everyone to have the 
equipment that they need to do their 
jobs. 
Our healthcare workers are on the 
front line, as are the others. Emer-
gency services, police, and fire, some of 
them are the first people to respond to 
a 911 call. They are in the line of de-
fense, and they do not have the PPE, 
the 
personal 
protective 
equipment, 
that they need, and we owe them. 
We are not worthy of thanking them, 
thanking them, praising them, unless 
we support them, and that is not being 
done sufficiently. That is what we have

to do in the next bill—I call it the He-
roes Act—when we will come together 
to support our heroes. 
Unfortunately, there was not enough 
interest in this bill right here on the 
part of others to join us in supporting 
our heroes, our healthcare workers, our 
police and fire, emergency services, in 
the form of supporting State and local 
government. 
When you hear State and local, it 
might sound bureaucratic, but it isn’t. 
Those are the people who meet the 
needs of the American people and are 
on the front line of fighting this virus. 
So, when we finish this—and I am 
pleased to hear the distinguished chair-
man of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, Mr. NEAL, talk about the fact 
that we are already preparing for that. 
We have been for a while, because we 
just didn’t really know that this in-
terim bill would come up. But when it 
did, again, we had to meet the needs of 
the American people. 
I am so proud that all of the bills we 
are passing, as has been acknowledged, 
have been done in a bipartisan way, 
and the next bill will be as well. 
But let me just correct the RECORD, 
because the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas said we held up this bill, 
and I want to correct that RECORD be-
cause nothing could be further from 
the truth, and perhaps he isn’t aware, 
but let me inform. 
Two weeks ago, the distinguished 
Secretary of the Treasury called me 
and said: I need a quarter of a trillion 
in 48 hours. 
Oh, really? Well, I don’t know about 
that. Let’s see what we can do. Let’s 
see. Why do you need that? 
That was April 7. The next day, on 
April 8, Democrats came together, 
House and Senate Democrats, and 
made a proposal that went beyond the 
$250 billion for the PPP, a program 
that we helped shape and that we fully 
support, supporting our small busi-
nesses, the entrepreneurship of Amer-
ica, the optimism of America, the cre-
ators of jobs and wealth and commu-
nity in our country. So we are there 
with that. 
But we saw some evidence that ev-
erything wasn’t being done as we had 
hoped, and so we proposed, 1 day later, 
that we would have additional funding 
for small businesses, a $60 billion set- 
aside for the smallest of small busi-
nesses: women, minority-owned busi-
nesses, rural America, veterans, Native 
American communities, and the rest, 
who were not, shall we say, as bank-
able as some others, the underbanked, 
$60 billion. 
Another $60 billion, we said, for all of 
our small businesses: $50 billion of it 
for the EIDL, the disaster assistance 
loans, put $50 billion there. That $50 
billion is leveraged to over $300 billion 
in lending, easier lending for some than 
PPP because it is just a loan; it is not 
about the bank deciding. And then the 
other $10 billion—we wanted 15, we got 
10 for the grants. 
So there we got 60 and 60, 120, and 
then another $100 billion for the hos-
pitals. That was on April 8, $100 billion 
for the hospitals, divided: hospitals, 75; 
testing, $25 billion. 
The Senate Republicans went to the 
floor the next day, on April 9, which 
was the 24 hours from the request of 
the quarter of a trillion dollars. MITCH 
MCCONNELL went to the floor and said: 
This is it, 250, not one penny more. 
This is what it is. 
The Senate Democrats objected, of-
fered an amendment that includes 
what we are voting on today. MITCH 
MCCONNELL said: Absolutely not. That 
was it. 
So for 1 week, he kept saying: I am 
going to bring it up again on Monday. 
I am going to bring it up on Thursday. 
For 1 week there was that delay. 
Finally, that was Thursday of last 
week, there was interest in negotia-
tion. And what we have on the floor 
today is the result of not time that we 
delayed the legislation, but the time 
that the Republicans refused to accept 
the fact that we needed $100 billion for 
our hospitals and our testing, that we 
needed more money for those who do 
not have sophisticated banking rela-
tionships, where we can have commu-
nity development financial institutions 
reach into communities where they 
know the businesses, the neighborhood, 
the community, the people, the cus-
tomers, the clients. 
So we should be very, very proud of 
the work that was done by Chairwoman 
NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ of the Small Busi-
ness Committee and Chairwoman MAX-
INE
WATERS, chair of the Financial 
Services Committee, banks, small busi-
ness coming with an idea that was re-
jected out of hand by the leader of the 
Senate: Don’t even bring that around. 
It is only this; that is it, or else you 
don’t support small business. 
So when I hear, during the previous 
debate on the other bill and then this 
distinguished ranking member on the 
Ways and Means Committee, whom I 
respect, and he knows that, say we de-
layed this, no, you delayed this be-
cause—now, this isn’t about assign-
ment. This is about taking responsi-
bility. 
Without the discussion over this past 
weekend which resulted in the Senate 
passing the bill unanimously, MITCH 
MCCONNELL, who wasn’t going to do 
one more penny, unanimously passing 
the bill, and then saying it has all this 
additional help that we initiated, that 
he initiated. He resisted it, but he ini-
tiated it. 
So I think it is really important for 
people to understand what this fight is 
about. It is not about trickle-down. We 
were successful in turning the CARES 
Act from a corporate-oriented, trickle- 
down bill to a workers-first, bubble-up 
bill, and we were proud of that and that 
it passed and was signed by the Presi-
dent. 
Once again, they just had the 250. We 
fully support that. We helped create 
that. But that isn’t the end of the day 
for what else we needed to do. 
And while I understand that they are 
resistant to helping those at the lower 
end of the scale, I can’t understand 
why they resisted $100 billion for the 
hospitals and the testing, because that 
was central to meeting the needs, the 
health needs of the American people. I 
want more, of course. I want more than 
that. 
So now we go to the next bill. I call 
it the Heroes Act. We fully support 
that. We helped create that. But that 
isn’t the end of the day for what else 
we needed to do. 
And while I understand that they are 
resistant to helping those at the lower 
end of the scale, I can’t understand 
why they resisted $100 billion for the 
hospitals and the testing, because that 
was central 
b 1200 
Unfortunately, they do not want to 
put the heroes into this bill today as 
fully as they should by supporting 
State and local. 
And what does the distinguished 
leader on the Senate side, Mr. MCCON-
NELL, say? I am not doing any more 
bills. I think the States should go 
bankrupt. 
Oh, 
really? 
And 
not 
pay 
the 
healthcare workers and public hos-
pitals, the first responders and the 
rest? Oh, really? What made you think 
that was a good idea? It is just more 
notion mongering to get attention, I 
guess. 
And so I came to this floor fully 
happy in terms of our bipartisanship, 
totally sad about what it is in terms of 
the lives of America’s families and the 
uncertainty they face and the illness 
that some are suffering and the loss of 
life that many others, tens of thou-
sands, have suffered. 
But to hear them say we held up this 
bill, when they are doing today, with 
great pride, exactly what the Senate 
Democrats asked them to do on April 9. 
So I just wanted to set the record 
straight on that. 
Again, I want to thank MAXINE 
WATERS and NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ and I 
want to thank FRANK PALLONE for the 
great work that he did and the staff of 
all of those committees. 
We are voting on the floor today with 
a strong agreement that sets a path 
that we had in the CARES Act, the 
issues that were addressed in the 
CARES Act. Of course, we had State 
and local in the CARES Act; they 
wouldn’t go there here. 
So what we are doing is we are help-
ing small businesses. We are strength-
ening the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. It is $310 billion, including that 
critical $60 billion reserved for under-
served rural, urban, and Tribal commu-
nities. 
By supporting small businesses that 
cannot access the PPP, we secured $50 
billion for emergency assistance lend-
ing. That will be leveraged into over 
$300 billion in disaster assistance loans 
and $10 billion more for grants to small 
businesses. 
For hospitals, providers, and health 
workers: We secured $75 billion for 
health providers, which are losing rev-
enue every day, and for physicians and 
health workers who are risking their 
lives because they don’t have PPE. 
In one of the New York hospitals, I 
heard a nurse say on TV that when she 
went to meet the needs of the patients, 
she was given not the regular gown and 
mask and gloves and the rest. She was

given a New York Yankees rain pon-
cho. Others were wearing garbage bags. 
Some of them said they were wearing 
medical waste on their faces because 
they could not change the mask, and 
they would go to maybe four patients 
instead of the one and discard. 
So again, we thank them, we honor 
them, we revere them. But we have no 
right to do that unless we support 
them with what they need. They are 
risking their lives to save other lives, 
and now they may lose their jobs un-
less we do our Heroes Act, which I look 
forward to doing. 
For testing: We secured $25 billion for 
testing, which is key, central, to re-
opening our economy and resuming our 
lives. 
The administration has also agreed— 
and this is very positive—to a national 
testing strategy that will increase do-
mestic testing capacity and address 
disparities, including across race, eth-
nicity, and geographic regions. 
Unfortunately, as I mentioned, the 
administration was not ready to in-
clude funding for our heroes, our 
healthcare, fire, EMS, and other essen-
tial workers, for the postal system, 
which is essential to us now in getting 
information and materials where they 
need to be. And that is why CARES 2 
must be about our Heroes Act, focusing 
on support for healthcare and essential 
workers. And I can’t say it enough. 
And then with that overarching con-
cern for them, OSHA, so they have 
safety in the workplace, family and 
medical leave, so that they can meet 
the needs of their families, COBRA for 
those who have lost their jobs. And we 
need full funding for COBRA, and I 
hope the administration will be recep-
tive to that. Pension, additional UI, 
and more indirect payments and more. 
So let us be clear, the health and 
safety of our country will be endan-
gered if we cannot pay the heroes who 
sacrifice to keep us safe. They are 
being fired as we speak. Mr. SCHUMER 
was referencing hospitals in his State 
where people were let go from public 
hospitals. But that is not unusual. Our 
teachers, the custodians of our chil-
dren, are being let go. We have to face 
that, and we have to do it very soon 
and next. 
And it is unacceptable that Leader 
MCCONNELL thinks that no further leg-
islation is needed. That is what he said: 
No further legislation is needed. And 
he thinks our heroic workers can wait 
and our States who hire them should 
go bankrupt. 
As CARES 2 protects the lives and 
livelihoods of the American people, it 
must also protect the life of the Amer-
ican democracy: safeguarding the in-
tegrity of our elections and supporting 
voting by mail. 
So, again, it is the lives of the people, 
the livelihood of the people, the life of 
our democracy. 
Again, our prayers are with those 
who are suffering. His Holiness, Pope 
Francis—and I quote him all the time— 
he said weeks ago, his world prayer, 
that God would enlighten those who 
have responsibility to take responsi-
bility for those in their care. 
Let us hope that we can all be pray-
erful, take responsibility, do the job for 
the American people. We have an ex-
traordinary opportunity to do that. 
But we must do so in a way that 
keeps them safe, as we want to open 
our economy and do so—again, science, 
science, science, and science. Let us 
show the same courage and strength 
and move with great urgency to pro-
vide the support that they need, that 
they provide to others. 
And, again, we have our differences, 
there is no question. I heard the gen-
tleman speak out against the $600 for 
people who are unemployed. I think 
that we have to do whatever we can to 
recognize that public policy has a role 
here, that governance carries with it 
responsibility and opportunity and re-
sults and progress for the American 
people and that science and governance 
are 
the 
answers 
to 
meeting 
the 
healthcare needs and meeting the 
needs of our economy as we go forward. 
So I thank our colleagues for their 
leadership, 
MAXINE
WATERS, 
NYDIA 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, FRANK PALLONE, our dis-
tinguished chair of the Ways and 
Means Committee, for his work, and so 
many people. 
Again, right now, as we speak, the 
Agriculture Committee is meeting. 
And as some of our colleagues have 
said, we can’t do SNAP? They turned 
down SNAP, food stamps, at a time 
when America is hungry? 
We have our differences, but we are 
coming together on this particular bill, 
and I am proud of that. It is bipartisan, 
it is urgent, and let us get on with it so 
that we can get on to supporting our 
heroes in a way that is worthy of their 
sacrifice. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself 30 seconds. 
I respectfully remember a different 
history where only one fund was out of 
money, those for our small businesses. 
The President asked for us to move 
quickly, and it was blocked in the Sen-
ate by those who said there is no proof 
small businesses need this money. And 
I remember the Speaker herself saying 
there is no data that shows small busi-
nesses need money. Those critical 
funds were blocked and held up for 16 
days. This agreement we have today 
could have been agreed to in 5 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), 
the leading Republican on the Small 
Business Committee. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, this 
has not been an easy time for Amer-
ica’s small businesses. As the ranking 
member of the House Small Business 
Committee, I hear daily from owners of 
restaurants and hair salons and small 
retailers and manufacturers and gro-
cers and others, about the gut-wrench-
ing choices that they have been forced 
to make recently. 
Fortunately, the Paycheck Protec-
tion 
Program, 
created 
under 
the 
CARES Act, has already helped small 
businesses save millions of jobs and 
cover essential expenses. 
One company, for example, New York 
Bagel, survived the Great Depression 
and World War II during its 99 years of 
operation. This Ferndale, Michigan, 
business was forced to close due to the 
coronavirus. But thanks to the Pay-
check Protection Program, their em-
ployees are still getting paid. 
After losing 70 percent of their busi-
ness, Woodyard Bar-B-Que in Kansas 
City was only a week or two away from 
laying off workers or even closing per-
manently. Their paycheck protection 
loan will allow them to stay in busi-
ness. 
These examples are only a fraction of 
those who have been helped. Under-
standably, this program has been very 
popular. In fact, demand was so high 
that funding was exhausted within 2 
weeks of the program being started up. 
Over a million-and-a-half loans have 
been processed, with nearly 60,000 in 
my home State of Ohio alone. 
Madam Speaker, small businesses are 
resilient. Start-ups are pioneering new 
techniques for sanitizing masks and 
surfaces. 
Neighborhood 
grocers 
are 
bravely staying open to provide nec-
essary supplies, yes, including toilet 
paper, for their communities. 
Small manufacturers are retooling to 
make personal protective equipment 
for frontline workers. These small busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs make the 
America we all know and love. 
Congress should have passed this leg-
islation last week, but to those small 
businesses who already applied and are 
waiting to hear, or those who are yet 
to apply for this relief, finally, help is 
on the way. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ala-
bama (Ms. SEWELL), a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise in support of this 
bill to provide additional resources for 
small, local, and minority-owned busi-
nesses and nonprofits under the Pay-
check Protection Program, as well as 
to provide resources for our hospitals 
and for testing. 
Madam Speaker, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program has not been without 
its controversy. I have heard too many 
stories of frustrated business owners 
who have not been able to access the 
program due to a lack of existing rela-
tionships with a lender or difficulty 
navigating the complex application 
process. And these are issues that are 
disproportionately 
harming 
local, 
rural, and minority-owned businesses 
that make up the heart of my district. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad that we 
are taking steps today to address the 
inequities and indirectly and directly 
allow funding for lenders that service 
the truly local barber shops, beauty 
shops, restaurants on Main Street 
across this country. These are the busi-
nesses that are the lifeline of so many

of our local economies, and it is impor-
tant that we make sure that this lend-
ing gets to these vitally important 
businesses. 
I hope that this bill will offer some 
relief to these businesses, and I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
I also ask our leaders and the lenders 
to know that we are watching them. 
We want the truly small, local busi-
nesses to get their fair share. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. WALDEN), the lead Repub-
lican on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my colleague from 
Texas for his leadership on this issue. 
I, too, rise in support of the Pay-
check Protection Program and the 
Health Care Enhancement Act. This 
provides a fourth installment of funds 
to continue to address the impact of 
the COVID–19 virus on the American 
people. 
We have heard all the stories about 
how people have lost their lives, lost 
their loved ones, lost their business, 
lost their jobs. This bill will replenish 
the Paycheck Protection Program for 
small businesses, and it will provide 
additional funding for healthcare pro-
viders and expanded testing. 
And I am glad we are finally here. 
For too long, Democrat leaders in the 
House and Senate played partisan poli-
tics. They needlessly delayed the ini-
tial passage of the CARES Act, and 
then they prevented a quick replenish-
ment of the funds for the PPP. That 
left our small businesses and the people 
they employ in the lurch. 
With record unemployment claims, 
we have seen that every single day, 
every day, counts in this pandemic. 
That is why Republicans and President 
Trump were so adamant over the last 
two weeks about the need to not let 
these programs run out of money. We 
all knew that was going to happen. We 
could have done this unanimously. 
Painfully, Democrats took an ice- 
cream break while small businesses 
were left empty-handed, a pointless 
weeklong shuttering of the Paycheck 
Protection Program that hurt Ameri-
cans and undoubtedly cost thousands 
of jobs. 
As a member of the President’s bipar-
tisan task force on reopening the econ-
omy, I remain committed to ensuring 
that there are resources and strategies 
in place for widespread testing that our 
health and economic experts have said 
is needed to reopen the country. 
And while I support additional fund-
ing for healthcare-related expenses, it 
should never have been at the expense 
of bankrupting more small employers 
and throwing more people into the un-
employment lines. 
The American people’s plight should 
not be used as leverage for partisan pri-
orities, especially in the midst of a cri-
sis. We must move forward in a united 
way that puts the needs of the Amer-
ican people first. 
Now, let’s pass this measure, get it to 
the President’s desk, so we can begin 
to safely reopen this country. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, let me 
describe hospitals as a priority. 
With that, Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
b 1215 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of the Pay-
check Protection Program and Health 
Care Enhancement Act. 
COVID–19 is a crisis with few par-
allels in world history. Yet I have been 
amazed by the resilience of my fellow 
Rhode Islanders: the tenacity of our 
small businesses and the dedication 
and bravery of our frontline healthcare 
workers. 
This bill is for them. It refills the 
coffers of the Paycheck Protection 
Program, which is a vital lifeline for so 
many small businesses. Thanks to 
House Democrats’ efforts, it backstops 
our hospitals, community health cen-
ters, and nursing homes and funds the 
nationwide testing strategy. 
This cannot be the end of the work of 
Congress to help Americans weather 
the storm, but it is another vital step 
as we confront this crisis. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GRANGER), the top Repub-
lican 
on 
the 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of the Pay-
check Protection Program and the 
Health Care Enhancement Act, which 
provides nearly $500 billion for eco-
nomic recovery and public health ef-
forts in response to the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
The cornerstone of this legislation is 
the 
support 
for 
small 
businesses 
through the PPP, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. These PPP loans, 
which can be completely forgiven, are 
essential for small businesses to con-
tinue paying their employees and cover 
operating costs. 
To illustrate how crucial this loan 
has been to the 30 million small busi-
nesses in this country, the SBA sup-
ported more loans in the first 14 days 
of the PPP than it did in the last 14 
years. In total, more than $340 billion 
has been provided to more than 1.6 mil-
lion American small businesses. 
An additional $60 billion is provided 
in this bill for another key source of 
assistance for small business: economic 
injury disaster loans and grants. Bor-
rowers can get loans at low interest 
rates and then repay them over a long 
period of time, up to 30 years. 
This legislation also provides $100 bil-
lion for critical healthcare initiatives. 
These funds will support our heroes on 
the front lines and allow us to deploy 
more tests so we know where the virus 
is having the most impact. With this 
information, we can begin safely re-
opening our communities and restart-
ing our economy. 
While it took much too long to get 
this bill to the floor today, I want to 
thank my colleagues for coming to-
gether to deliver results for the Amer-
ican people whose health and liveli-
hoods depend on it. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting on this measure to continue 
supporting our Nation’s small busi-
nesses, their hardworking employees, 
and our critical healthcare workers. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Mexico (Mr. LUJA´ N), the well-regarded 
Congressman who also has the title of 
Assistant Speaker. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
In the face of this crisis, I have seen 
so many New Mexicans step up. They 
have gathered fabric scraps, distributed 
masks, checked in with their neigh-
bors, and showed their resilience over 
and over. But so many people, small 
businesses, and communities continue 
to struggle. 
Today, we approve $360 billion for 
small businesses, $75 billion for our 
hospitals and frontline workers who 
are doing heroic work to save lives, and 
$25 billion so that more people can be 
tested for this deadly virus. 
But our work is not done. Everyone 
knows this is not enough, and due to 
Republican opposition, this package 
fails to provide necessary relief to our 
local, State, and Tribal governments. 
MITCH MCCONNELL said local govern-
ments should file for bankruptcy to 
make themselves whole. 
I had the honor this last week to par-
ticipate in a townhall with the Navajo 
Nation, and I heard firsthand their 
struggles. They need resources, water, 
and testing. We need to do more for 
them, and we need to do more for the 
people of New Mexico and everyone liv-
ing in the United States of America. 
Small businesses must be prioritized 
by approving these loans and grants. 
The American people are counting on 
us. Let’s act. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the Republican 
leader of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Texas (Mr. 
BRADY) for yielding and for his great 
leadership on this bill. 
Today, America is in a crisis. Not 
since the Spanish flu of 1918 has the 
world faced a global pandemic of such 
epic proportions. This virus, which 
came out of Wuhan, China, has created 
fear and devastation across the globe. 
COVID–19 has infected more than 2.6 
million people around the world and 
killed nearly 200,000. It has paralyzed 
our economy, forcing more than 26 mil-
lion Americans into unemployment in 
just a few short weeks. And that is why 
we took the risk, Madam Speaker, to 
fly back here today so we can do our 
job and vote for this important legisla-
tion.

H1928 
April 23, 2020 
This rescue package throws a lifeline 
to small businesses and the American 
worker to keep them whole during this 
hard time. It provides much-needed 
funding for testing and for our hos-
pitals that need it desperately. 
In closing, I want to take this oppor-
tunity to thank the brave American 
heroes who are on the front line today: 
our doctors, nurses, and first respond-
ers who are risking their lives every 
day. We honor their sacrifice to our 
Nation. 
At the end of the day, as Americans, 
we are all in this together, and to-
gether we will get through this hard 
time and be stronger than ever before. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), the very capa-
ble Democratic whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
time. 
Madam Speaker I rise today in sup-
port of this emergency spending pack-
age. I believe this legislation moves us 
a step closer to my vision of making 
America’s greatness accessible and af-
fordable for all. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has laid bare 
the inequities in our healthcare system 
that are having dramatic negative im-
pacts on health outcomes in minority 
communities. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., observed 
back in 1966: ‘‘Of all the forms of in-
equality, injustice in health is the 
most shocking and the most inhuman 
because it often results in physical 
death.’’ How prescient. 
To know the full extent of how this 
virus is ravaging communities of color, 
we must test, test, test. That is why I 
am pleased there is $25 billion in this 
package for testing, which allows for 
my advocacy of mobile testing. 
We must make testing accessible and 
affordable for rural and persistent-pov-
erty communities facing obstacles due 
to a lack of transportation. 
This pandemic has also laid bare the 
inequities in our financial system. The 
first round of funding through the Pay-
check Protection Program went to 
businesses with long-term banking re-
lationships. Many small family and mi-
nority-owned businesses and nonprofit 
organizations were shut out. That is 
why Democrats insisted that $60 billion 
be reserved in this package for commu-
nity-based lenders, such as community 
development, 
financial 
institutions, 
minority depository institutions, and 
credit unions. 
This legislation is not perfect, but it 
is a step towards making some much- 
needed relief accessible and affordable. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
April 1, Secretary Mnuchin warned 
us that the PPP has high demand and 
will likely need more funding. 
April 4, President Trump tweeted out 
a statement supporting more funding a 
day after the program opened up. 
April 7, Secretary Mnuchin requests 
more funding for the program, warning 
that we will run out. 
April 9, Senate Democrats block re-
plenishing this funding, winning praise 
from fellow Democrats. 
Members, colleagues, we had ample 
warning of the funding running out on 
numerous occasions during this month 
of April that we have been away. How 
many small restaurants, hairdressers, 
bookstores, et cetera, in your districts 
have suffered and closed because the 
majority is too busy looking at the 
election in November to see today’s 
crisis in April? 
Yet, so after all this time and the 
travel it took us all to get here wear-
ing masks, what is the first thing we 
bring up? A duplicative, partisan select 
subcommittee to make a political spec-
tacle of the virus. 
I sit as a member on the Transpor-
tation Committee. We can oversee the 
oversight of FEMA just fine. 
Our Commerce Committee can have 
oversight of HHS. We don’t need extra, 
duplicative committees. 
We are 22 days behind. We need to get 
back to work and put the people back 
to work and get this done. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Nevada 
(Mr. HORSFORD), a well-regarded Con-
gressman. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today to speak in favor of this 
emergency coronavirus supplemental 
package. 
I am glad that we are delivering for 
the people of Nevada, including bring-
ing home billions of dollars of addi-
tional funding for Nevada’s 270,000 
small businesses and nonprofits. We 
also are positioning our country for re-
covery in voting for $25 billion for 
COVID–19 testing. 
This bipartisan agreement is one of 
the many steps that we must take to 
provide the American people with the 
relief they need. However, for Senate 
majority Leader MCCONNELL to suggest 
that our States and local governments 
should be bankrupt in order to be made 
whole is outrageous. These are our he-
roes. They are on the front lines. 
I urge this body to pass this legisla-
tion and to work with us now to pass 
the Heroes Act. 
Mr. BRADY. I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCH-
ELL). 
Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 266, which pro-
vides badly needed financial support 
for small businesses and hospitals. Our 
Nation continues to struggle with the 
health 
and 
economic 
impacts 
of 
COVID–19. 
But I must also comment on the 
function of Congress. We passed the 
CARES Act almost 30 days ago. Since 
then, the lights have been off here. 
Today, we vote for one crucial item 
and depart again. 
I will vote ‘‘aye’’ on the relief pack-
age, but I stress Congress must get 
back to work here in the Capitol. We 
all must resume our full duties and ob-
ligations to the Constitution and, most 
importantly, to the American people. 
We took an oath to preserve and pro-
tect both. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the distinguished Congresswoman 
from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise with the good, the bad, and the 
ugly for small businesses. 
The good: Democrats fought hard and 
won in providing more than $310 billion 
for small businesses. 
The bad: It may not be enough. 
The ugly: Thousands and thousands 
of small businesses and minority busi-
nesses may be left out again. 
The past weeks of economic history 
and trends offer reasonable predictions 
of what we should do in this financial 
assistance funding bill. 
The longstanding economic inequal-
ities already undermine any ability to 
close the wealth gap, and COVID–19 
will undeniably exacerbate this para-
digm. 
I am asking that we match the lan-
guage that the Democrats fought so 
hard for. It is not enough just to allo-
cate funding to institutions; we must 
hold the Secretary of the Treasury ac-
countable that minority and small 
businesses will not be left out. 
Just like in the film ‘‘The Good, the 
Bad and the Ugly,’’ we must be the one 
to shoot the COVID–19 noose to save 
small businesses. I know that we will 
do more in the weeks to come because 
this a great victory for Democrats, but 
still not enough. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. JOYCE), a member of the 
Small Business Committee. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, all of us want our small busi-
nesses to survive this economic crisis. 
All of us want to save American liveli-
hoods. All of us want to get Americans 
back to work. 
For weeks, I have talked to workers, 
small business owners, farmers in 
Pennsylvania who are counting on the 
Paycheck Protection Act. 
Today, we are offering these Penn-
sylvanians an opportunity to keep 
their workers paid and emerge stronger 
on the other side of this unprecedented 
challenge by protecting our workforce 
and safeguarding our economy. 
Truly these are difficult days, but we 
know there is light ahead. 
The people of Pennsylvania are resil-
ient. The people of our great Nation 
are resilient. Together, we will weather 
the storm. 
We cannot allow a virus to destroy 
the American Dream. 
b 1230 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), a well- 
known advocate for the people of 
Michigan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1929 
April 23, 2020 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the latest 
COVID–19 relief package. 
In my State of Michigan, the num-
bers are devastating. There are more 
than 33,000 confirmed cases. I want to 
add another number today: over 2,800 
deaths. I just got a phone call that an-
other dear friend of mine has passed. 
Nearly 1.2 million people have filed for 
unemployment. 
That is why I am back here today. 
We, however, have a lot more work to 
do. The package is not perfect. More 
work must be done to provide assist-
ance to our States and our local gov-
ernments, to ensure the continuous op-
eration of the Postal Service, where 
there is a statement that neither snow 
nor rain nor gloom of night should stay 
the completion of mail delivery. The 
COVID virus is devastating the Postal 
Service. 
I want you to know that the $484 bil-
lion measure will provide desperately 
needed financial support. 
I stand here today with my heart bro-
ken in support of this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of this emergency legislation that 
prioritizes to replenish emergency re-
lief for all small businesses and hos-
pitals across the Nation. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has, without doubt, been instrumental 
in helping small businesses in Puerto 
Rico and America keep their employ-
ees paid through this unprecedented 
crisis. 
Lenders in Puerto Rico approved 
more than 2,800 of these loans, dis-
bursing a total of $658 million before 
the funds ran out. We have got less 
than .17 percent of all the Nation’s 
PPP loans, making us jurisdiction 
number 52. 
I expect this bill now would allow the 
rest of those small businesses to get it 
and to get it now. 
The island’s economy has been great-
ly impacted, just like the people here 
on the mainland. And now with more 
than 150,000 employees that are out of 
work and the small businesses that are 
out of business, it is imperative that 
we support this bill and immediately 
provide vital aid to American busi-
nesses across the Nation, which are the 
lifeblood of our economy. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD), a very ca-
pable Congressman and a close friend 
of mine. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Chairman NEAL for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to thank and 
commend my colleagues for their work 
on this $480 billion legislation. 
On April 7, as the Speaker said, Re-
publicans wanted $250 billion, but no 
more. 
After Democratic demands, Repub-
licans finally agreed to increase the 
$250 billion to $480 billion to include 
our priorities. An additional $60 billion 
was set aside for small banks and com-
munity development financial institu-
tions and credit unions. 
We were determined to add billions 
for small community lenders. We wrote 
into the legislation that these loans 
will be forgiven if properly used for 
paycheck protection. 
I call on Secretary Mnuchin to follow 
through on his commitment to Chairs 
WATERS and VELA´ ZQUEZ to ensure that 
these small lenders get the money; 
make sure the money gets into the 
hands of African American, Latino, 
women, and veteran-owned businesses; 
make sure the money gets into the 
hands of nonprofits and churches. 
I call on the Small Business Adminis-
tration to furnish data on the approved 
lenders authorized to originate these 
loans, provide a report to us by race 
and ethnicity as to whether diverse en-
tities are receiving these loans and 
grants. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. KUSTOFF). 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram and Health Care Enhancement 
Act. 
There is no doubt that our small 
businesses 
in 
west 
Tennessee 
and 
across the Nation have felt the brunt of 
the 
economic 
effects 
of 
the 
coronavirus. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has saved small businesses in west Ten-
nessee and also allowed them to keep 
their employees on the payroll. 
Now, I am disappointed that the 
Democrats didn’t allow a vote on this 
funding before today, but I am appre-
ciative of the vote. 
I look forward to voting for this 
funding today that will give American 
small businesses the resources to main-
tain their livelihoods and weather the 
storm. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. KELLY), a real champion of 
small business. 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I support this legislation be-
cause hospitals and small businesses in 
our communities need relief. 
Our communities need this bridge 
over troubled waters. 
This legislation rightfully invests 
$300-plus billion into the backbone of 
our economy: small businesses. It puts 
$75 billion into our Nation’s hospitals 
and ensures that those serving our 
most vulnerable receive the resources 
they need to save lives. It invests $25 
billion in testing. 
As the chair of the CBC Health 
Braintrust, we must make sure that 
the testing goes into the areas dis-
proportionately 
affected, 
like 
the 
Black and Brown communities. 
This legislation includes language 
developed by me, along with Congress-
women BASS, LEE, and PRESSLEY, as 
well as Senators WARREN, HARRIS, and 
BOOKER, to ensure that we collect and 
analyze racial data related to the obvi-
ous disparity in COVID–19. 
The better data made possible by this 
bill must effectively direct resources 
into our communities where needed, 
not where best connected. 
Let us also remember the postal 
workers, the State and local govern-
ments, our teachers. They need our re-
sources also. 
Madam Speaker, I want to give my 
condolences to Senator WARREN for los-
ing her brother to COVID–19. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. HUIZENGA). 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, 
while we have many different ap-
proaches about restarting our econ-
omy, we should all agree the Paycheck 
Protection Program has provided a 
vital lifeline to small businesses and 
communities across America, including 
west Michigan. 
For example, media reports are that 
Macatawa Bank, a community bank 
based in Holland, Michigan, was able to 
process over $300 million in PPP loans. 
This will help keep paychecks coming 
to more than 27,000 hardworking people 
in west Michigan. 
In Wellington, Michigan, I heard 
from an owner of a bowling alley whose 
business was literally saved by the 
PPP. His employees are getting paid, 
he can pay his bills, and his business 
has avoided bankruptcy. 
Even with these successes, I have 
heard from employers across my dis-
trict waiting to receive their loan. 
While I am glad that is happening 
today, it shouldn’t have taken this 
long. 
Now, Madam Speaker, as we discuss 
the next steps the Federal Government 
can take, I encourage the Speaker and 
my colleagues to support H.R. 6433, a 
bill I introduced on April 3, the Heroes 
Act, as a way to say thank you to the 
first responders and medical profes-
sionals risking their lives on a daily 
basis to save the lives of others. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), a very influential 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Chairman NEAL for yielding me 
time. 
I am in awe of the countless unsung 
heroes who made it possible for all of 
us to get here safely today. We thank 
them. 
I am here not just to vote for badly 
needed additional relief, but in support 
of the Speaker and our leadership in 
their successful effort resisting the Re-
publicans and the Senate in fighting 
against making it better. 
But I am here to give voice to my fel-
low Oregonians, who know so much 
more needs to be done, that it is out-
rageous that big banks and the Trump 
administration gave too much to the

wrong people and not enough to those 
most in need. 
The administration can do something 
that costs taxpayers nothing: clarify 
the PPP provisions with a simple an-
swer on how exactly the forgiveness 
provisions are going to work. 
I was on the phone until 1 a.m. last 
night with a small businesswoman in 
Portland who, because of this lack of 
clarity, is unsure if she should even ac-
cept the loan that she has been given. 
We must do better for the small busi-
nesses and the millions of jobs that de-
pend upon them. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
like all bills, this bill comes down to 
how it is implemented. 
Right now we have a problem, and I 
hope that bureaucracy does a better 
job of implementing it. 
The PPP in this program is going to, 
I believe, a lot of businesses that are 
actually even better off because of the 
virus, because it is being so sloppily ad-
ministered. I hope in the future, if we 
pass this bill, that people pay attention 
to that. 
I also realize a lot of money is going 
to hospitals who have relied on pre-
dictions coming out of Washington 
that they were going to get a lot of pa-
tients that they may not be getting. 
Right now in my district and many 
other districts, nurses and other hos-
pital personnel are being laid off and 
hospitals are losing money because 
they were expecting a deluge of pa-
tients that never came, gratefully. 
I hope in the future that the rec-
ommendations out of Washington are 
more on target and the employees of 
my hospitals can get back to work as 
we begin to do colonoscopies, mammo-
grams, hips, knees, and diagnostic 
tests one more time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES), who has done a 
remarkable job during this trying pe-
riod as the chair of the Democratic 
Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chair for his 
tremendous leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this emergency spending legis-
lation. More must be done, but it is a 
strong step in the right direction. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is ravaging 
America. Small businesses are shut-
tered. Thousands have died. Millions of 
Americans are unemployed. 
Rome is burning. 
We can either put out the fire or 
watch our great Nation go down in 
flames. 
This bill will help family-owned busi-
nesses, help women-owned businesses, 
help minority-owned businesses, help 
small family farmers, and help our hos-
pitals and our nursing homes. 
Yes, it is not perfect, but we cannot 
allow the perfect to be the enemy of 
the good. 
We are here to legislate, not just pon-
tificate. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ and live to fight another 
day. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE). 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, my friend, for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the PPP program 
came out with astonishing speed. The 
President and the Secretary imple-
mented the legislation we passed, bi-
partisan, in astonishing speed, but 
there were criteria to get the money 
because we were spending $350 billion. 
I did have smaller banks and smaller 
businesses who did not have experience 
working with the SBA, with the Fed-
eral Government, who needed to come 
up to speed. I think all of us, hopefully, 
were home, and I certainly was, talk-
ing to our small businesses, our small 
banks, getting them online and getting 
them ready. 
I had small businesses saying, I don’t 
have my 2019 taxes prepared yet, and I 
have to have that to show my income 
for 2019. 
But it all came together right before 
we ran out of money, at least in my 
district. Everybody was in the portal 
or the small businesses were ready. 
And that is what we wanted, was $250 
billion to go forward, keep the program 
running, and they would be flush 
today. 
Doing the things we are doing now 
today, they are important too, they are 
bipartisan, we agree, but we didn’t 
have to have this interlude. 
So help is on the way. 
Our small businesses are now ready. 
It did take some time for some smaller 
banks and smaller businesses, but I am 
proud to say they are ready, and I am 
proud to vote for this bill today. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER), an ambassador, Congress-
man, 
successful 
businessman, 
and 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
I rise in support of this legislation to 
protect jobs, support small businesses, 
and save lives. 
It is good that we agree on this fund-
ing, but Americans need more, much 
more. 
As of this morning, 26 million Ameri-
cans have lost their jobs, in some 
States as many as one-third of their 
workforce. 
Workers need our help in a way that 
doesn’t stop or expire. Congress will 
have to do more to save small busi-
nesses both in funding, in making 
changes, and exercising oversight to 
ensure that it goes to small businesses. 
State and local governments des-
perately need our help. The idea that 
we would tell States and localities to 
bear the brunt and then let them go 
bankrupt, and lay off medical workers, 
police, firefighters, and teachers is des-
picable, and we must reject it. 
Letting State and local governments 
flounder would dangerously weaken the 
response ahead of the virus’ second ex-
pected wave. 
The American people deserve and 
need to be able to participate in their 
democracy safely, without having to 
risk their lives, and Congress should 
support State efforts to set up voting 
by mail. 
Finally, postal workers are risking 
their lives every day to deliver our 
mail. They deserve our support, and 
the Federal Government needs to keep 
their agency from going bankrupt. 
Only Congress can achieve these 
things, and we cannot delay. The need 
in this country is urgent, and the 
American people are depending on us.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I have one 
question: Where has Congress been? 
Forty-three 
percent 
of 
American 
households have had a significant or 
total pay cut; 26 million Americans 
have filed for unemployment; schools 
are shut down, placing burdens on fam-
ilies; and hospitals are laying off doc-
tors and nurses. Where has Congress 
been? 
Congress has met twice: first, to pass 
a $2 trillion bill that in many cases is 
harming the very businesses it pur-
ports to help; now, again, to spend 
more borrowed money without asking 
the important questions—no hearings, 
no oversight. 
Today, I am holding my nose voting 
for a bill I had no chance to shape be-
cause 
there 
are 
700,000 
businesses 
closed by the power of government on 
the outside looking in while Harvard 
qualifies for $9 million. 
But this is it, Madam Speaker, 
enough. No more half-assed legislating. 
No more picking winners and losers. No 
more asking a small restaurant to 
gamble, to borrow money in hopes that 
money will be forgiven by their govern-
ment if they rehire people. They can’t 
rehire because those same overlords 
are paying workers more in unemploy-
ment than to do their job. 
Congress 
must 
convene 
not 
just 
today, but every day until America is 
back on track. Our job is to make poli-
cies that will save lives by moving us 
forward with deliberation, facts, and 
balanced reason, not reaction, panic, 
and fear. 
Congress should be here, Madam 
Speaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from using 
profanity in debate. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU), 
a very well-regarded gentlewoman and 
a member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of the Paycheck Protection Program 
and Health Care Enhancement Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1931 
April 23, 2020 
In order to reopen our economy and 
conquer this virus, we need to have a 
real count of who has been infected, 
but we still don’t know the true impact 
of this pandemic because our Nation is 
facing a severe shortage of COVID–19 
tests. That is why it is so important 
that Democrats fought to include $25 
billion in this package to expand our 
testing capacity. 
Also of critical importance is that 
this legislation has the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program set aside $60 billion in 
lending authority for small community 
lenders, helping the countless small 
businesses turned away by big banks, 
like my constituent Tony, a dentist 
who has had a business account with 
Bank of America since 1983 but was de-
nied the opportunity to even apply for 
PPP. This set-aside authority gives our 
smallest businesses the resources and 
hope they need that they can survive 
this pandemic. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), a 
leader of the Financial Services Com-
mittee and newly appointed member of 
the Congressional Oversight Commis-
sion for the CARES Act. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. 
I rise in support of the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program Increase Act. In Ar-
kansas, there are more than 13,000 
pending PPP loan applications, rep-
resenting over $1.1 billion, Madam 
Speaker, of loans in limbo. Likewise, 
many await the SBA’s disaster loan 
funding and wait for it now. 
The timing of this additional funding 
is critical, and yet, again, I regret the 
delay by many leaders on the other 
side playing politics one more time 
with the livelihoods of our constitu-
ents. 
After the passage of this important 
package, I am confident that our em-
ployers and our consumers will pru-
dently be able to combine common 
sense and follow the CDC precautions 
and get back to work, back to seeing 
patients, back to the barbershop, back 
to their faith communities, and back 
to some semblance of normalcy. 
Americans always come together in 
times of crisis. We will defeat this for-
eign invader. We will get our economy 
back to full capacity. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS), champion of all 
things Buffalo and a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NEAL for 
yielding. 
This disaster relief bill includes $360 
billion for paycheck protection for 
American workers; $75 billion for our 
courageous healthcare workers and the 
institutions that they work at; and $25 
billion for virus testing to bend, break, 
and crush the disease curve. 
Sadly, New York’s State, county, and 
local governments were kicked out of 
this disaster relief bill, and the Senate 
majority leader’s arrogant advice for 
them to include bankruptcy is insult-
ing and arrogant. 
What we need at the time of national 
crisis, a national emergency, is we need 
leaders who possess goodness, humil-
ity, courage, and a sense that we are 
all in this together, a sense of national 
solidarity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are advised to refrain from engag-
ing in personalities toward the United 
States Senate. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS), Republican leader of the House 
Administration Committee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking 
Member BRADY and Chairman NEAL. 
I really appreciate the opportunity to 
come here to once again remind our 
colleagues that, if there is one thing 
that we ought to do right in this insti-
tution, it is to help Americans recover 
from a disaster that they didn’t ask 
for. We did that by coming together for 
the CARES Act. 
The PPP program in Illinois, alone, 
has made 69,893 loans to our Main 
Street businesses, worth almost $16 bil-
lion. But I want to tell you about one 
person who still has a need: Lindy 
McDonald of Myler Automotive Repair 
in Champaign, Illinois. She kept all of 
her employees. She is keeping her busi-
ness going even though customers are 
down. She is still in the queue to get 
funded by what we do today. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ for this legislation, and I 
thank you for the bipartisanship. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Worker & Family 
Support. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, the coronavirus has 
brought to national attention the huge 
disparities in health status and eco-
nomic status of African Americans and 
other population groups in this coun-
try. 
We have seen how some financial in-
stitutions overlooked and denied small, 
struggling businesses. This bill will do 
something about both. I hope it does, 
and I am confident that it will. 
After 
we 
have 
arrested 
the 
coronavirus, let’s do something dif-
ferent and help equalize America so 
that 
Blacks 
and 
other 
population 
groups are not dying in disproportion 
to our population. 
Let’s make America the great equal-
izer, the America that has never been 
and yet the America that we know can 
and must be, and let’s save our Postal 
Service. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic has resulted in an unprece-
dented public health and economic cri-
sis. While frontline providers are fight-
ing to keep us all safe, the deliberate 
slowdown of our economy has caused 
significant disruption for employers 
and employees throughout the country. 
In Pennsylvania, the Payroll Protec-
tion Program has, in a period of 12 
days, processed over 70,000 loans, total-
ing $15.7 billion, to help small busi-
nesses make payroll and save jobs. I 
thank our community banks and small 
businesses and the SBA for everything 
that was done. 
The severity of this crisis, however, 
necessitates additional funding for this 
program. For the past 2 weeks, Repub-
licans in Congress have advocated for 
additional appropriations while Demo-
crat leadership has permitted such 
delays to continue. 
It has been extremely disruptive for 
businesses that it took this long for 
the PPP to be increased. Businesses 
need some certainty. They do not have 
the luxury of waiting for partisan po-
litical games. Let’s not let this happen 
again, particularly during the course of 
this crisis. 
Our country must now focus our ef-
forts on planning to get back to work 
while maintaining a high level of safe-
ty standards. With new funding in 
place, we can continue to fight the 
virus, stay safe, and get our economy 
roaring again. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI), a 
champion of all things New York and a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I sup-
port this legislation. I am concerned, 
however, that the banks are focused on 
big small businesses and have ignored 
the smaller small businesses seeking 
$100,000 or less. 
I am asking my colleagues to send a 
clear message to the banks and to Sec-
retary Mnuchin: We will be watching. 
We need you to fight for the little 
guys. 
There are a lot of good things in this 
bill, including something we in New 
York have pushed for: money for hos-
pitals based on the rate of infection. 
But we need more. 
My three counties are in the top five 
in the Nation in confirmed cases. New 
York has over 30 percent of the cases 
and 30 percent of the deaths. Pre-
viously, this administration gave New 
York hospitals less money than Texas, 
which has only 3 percent of the cases. 
How does that make sense? 
Now Senator MCCONNELL is saying 
let’s bankrupt our hardest hit States 
and local governments. 
Madam Speaker, my State subsidizes 
Senator MCCONNELL’s State and has for 
decades. The grim reaper is telling my 
State and others to drop dead. 
Well, I have a message for you: We 
are going to fight you. Most Democrats 
and Republicans have put aside ideo-
logical differences for the common

good. We must continue to fight for 
New York, for my district, and for the 
little guy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP), a leader in the small business 
community. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member for yielding. 
In my 1 minute, let me tell you about 
Hornwood, Inc.—talk about a survivor. 
Hornwood is a specialty textile manu-
facturer in operation 74 years. It manu-
facturers products for the U.S. mili-
tary, many specialty applications, and 
now components for PPE. 
Hornwood’s main facility is in Anson 
County, among the most economically 
challenged counties in North Carolina. 
Hornwood employs almost 400, the 
largest employer in that county. 
Although it is designated essential, 
its revenues plummeted as government 
shut down the economy. Without a 
PPP loan, despite being essential, 
Hornwood must shut down imminently. 
It applied for PPP on the second day, 
but its application was caught in a 
snafu and the funds ran out. 
The 2 weeks consumed by the major-
ity’s exercise of leverage may well 
prove the fatal difference for Hornwood 
and thousands of other small busi-
nesses, but I am glad we are here fi-
nally to finish the job. 
To Hornwood and all of the others: 
Keep surviving. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I am de-
lighted to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ), a 
well-regarded member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of this package because I 
have small businesses in my district 
that are closing, after being in business 
for decades, right before our eyes. This 
bill is better than what the Repub-
licans originally proposed. 
And make no mistake about it, if it 
wasn’t for Democrats pushing to make 
changes, the businesses, the true small 
businesses—not the publicly traded 
companies—would still continue to be 
left behind. There would be no money 
for hospitals, no money for PPEs, no 
money for testing. It is the push of the 
Democrats that made this bill better 
and is why I am supporting it. 
I also want to be clear that this virus 
is on a different timeline. No matter 
what people think, no matter what 
people say, this is just the end of the 
beginning and not the beginning of the 
end. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Paycheck 
Protection Program and Health Care 
Enhancement Act. 
Less than a month ago, I stood on 
this floor and urged my colleagues to 
support our small businesses by pass-
ing the CARES Act. Today, I am here 
again asking the House to pass this bill 
and get it to the President’s desk so we 
can give our small businesses and 
healthcare providers the additional as-
sistance they need. 
This bill provides an extra $75 billion 
to our hospitals and $25 billion for ex-
panded testing capacity, with resources 
specifically set aside for community 
health centers and rural health clinics. 
These additional funds will have a dra-
matic impact in rural areas like Michi-
gan’s First District, where access to 
testing 
has 
lagged 
and 
our 
rural 
healthcare facilities are struggling to 
keep their doors open. 
This legislation also refills the Pay-
check Protection Program, critical for 
the Upper Peninsula and northern 
Michigan’s small businesses. This tem-
porary, targeted relief is our oppor-
tunity to send a strong message to our 
Main Street businesses that we want 
them to be able to open their doors 
when it is time to open our economy 
back up. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
b 1300 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS), the chairwoman 
of the Financial Services Committee, 
who is a major author of this legisla-
tion. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
and tough negotiations in support of 
this legislation, H.R. 266. 
I not only rise in support of this leg-
islation, the Enhancement Act, I also 
would like to rise in support of what 
we are doing for the Health Care En-
hancement Act in this bill. 
And I am going to take a moment to 
dedicate this legislation to my dear 
sister, who is dying in a hospital in St. 
Louis, Missouri, right now, infected by 
the coronavirus. 
This legislation provides $370 billion 
in funding for small businesses, as well 
as 
$100 
billion 
for 
hospitals 
and 
coronavirus testing. I am pleased that 
we have been able to set aside $60 bil-
lion for our Nation’s community devel-
opment financial institutions, minor-
ity depository institutions, community 
banks, credit unions, certified develop-
ment companies, and microlenders to 
directly lend to their small business 
customers, who are often minority- 
owned businesses. 
Small businesses and their workers 
all across the country are in dire need 
of assistance and will benefit from this 
bill. And so with that, Congress must 
now immediately turn to the next 
package of legislation to provide relief 
during the pandemic. We need to do 
much more to help renters, home-
owners, people experiencing homeless-
ness, and mom-and-pop landlords. 
As chairwoman of the Financial 
Services Committee, I am already 
working on additional coronavirus re-
lief legislation, including legislation 
that creates a $100 billion emergency 
rental assistance fund and a $75 billion 
homeowner assistance fund. 
Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 266, 
and look forward to working with my 
colleagues on the next relief package. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, our 
prayers are with Chairwoman WATERS, 
her sister, and her family. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
FLEISCHMANN), one of the leaders of the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in support of this, the fourth 
bill. 
At a time of adversity, I would like 
to reach out to my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. The American people 
are concerned, but we are optimistic. 
The American people are worried, but 
we will come through this adversity. I 
think of the people I represent in Ten-
nessee, but we are coming together as 
a Nation during this time like I have 
never seen us come together before. At 
a time of difficulty, we have an oppor-
tunity to actually seize this moment 
and move our great Nation forward. So, 
yes, am I concerned? Yes, I am con-
cerned. Of course, I am. But we will see 
better days in this great Nation. 
Madam Speaker, let us never forget, 
we in this Chamber represent the peo-
ple of the greatest Nation in the world. 
We shall prevail. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, we cer-
tainly express our best to MAXINE 
WATERS and her family at this chal-
lenging time. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE), the distinguished con-
gresswoman. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me acknowledge that people are 
dying. That sometime in the future, we 
may have one-sixth of the number of 
people that died in World War II in the 
battles on behalf of the United States. 
I rise because I support this legisla-
tion because it has universal testing 
for COVID–19. It is a matter of life and 
death. And I call upon using this $25 
billion for testing nursing homes and 
all essential workers. They must be as-
sured that they are safe. 
I join with the Congressional Black 
Caucus to make sure that we have con-
centrated voluntary testing in areas 
where there have been high deaths, 
contact tracing to identify the people, 
which has been included, antibody 
tests, working with our communities 
and faith-based. And, yes, The Nickel 
in the Fifth Ward, where Mickey Le-
land and Barbara Jordan work; that is 
a restaurant. I want them to be part of 
those who will get now the new dollars, 
the $60 billion that is going to help the 
very, very small. And I want to stand 
in the way of the Ruth’s Chris and the 
Shake Shacks, the large corporations, 
to make sure that they understand 
that we are sharing with each other. So 
small businesses now with minority 
banks and CDFIs can do this.

Finally, our hospitals that have been 
on the front lines. They need to be re-
imbursed and those who are Medicare 
focused, not just Medicaid focused, not 
just Medicare focused. 
And, yes, I want hero pay for our 
transit workers and hero pay for our 
professionals. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation now to save lives. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, and founder and Co-Chair of 
the Congressional Coronavirus Taskforce, I 
rise in strong support of the ‘‘Paycheck Pro-
tection Program and Health Care Enhance-
ment Act,’’ an interim measure that supple-
ments the CARES Act, the assistance and re-
lief package passed by Congress providing 
more than $2 trillion to address the adverse 
health and economic impacts of the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
But more must be done, and it is our obliga-
tion to ensure that the necessary assistance is 
provided, and that our decisions are informed 
by science, based on evidence, and put the 
physical safety and economic security and 
livelihoods of the American people foremost. 
Every day, we see the need for further ac-
tion to combat the coronavirus crisis. 
To date, there are more than 800,000 con-
firmed cases, over 43,000 dead, including 
20,196 cases and 547 deaths in my home 
state of Texas. 
On top of that, by taking the necessary 
measures to slow the pandemic and ‘flatten 
the curve’ so as not to overwhelm the nation’s 
health care system, economic activity in the 
United States has experienced a severe shock 
to the system. 
More than 22 million initial unemployment 
claims in the past month alone. 
In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dipped to 
18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on 
Election Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 
mark where it stood on January 20, 2017. 
In other words, Madam Speaker, all the 
gains that were made to the stock market and 
heralded by this Administration as evidence of 
its genius have been wiped out, depleting the 
retirement savings and 401ks of millions of or-
dinary Americans. 
Democrats dramatically changed the pack-
age originally proposed by the Senate from an 
insufficient Republican plan that left behind 
hospitals and health workers but did nothing to 
aid the survival of the most vulnerable small 
businesses on Main Street. 
That is why Democrats in Congress insisted 
on, fought for, and succeeded in shepherding 
into law the CARES Act, established the Pay-
check Protection Program (PPP), a new guar-
anteed loan program at the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) to help small businesses 
cover payroll and other expenses during the 
crisis, with 100 percent of the amount eligible 
for forgiveness if employers retain employees. 
The CARES Act also created the Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan Program, a new $10 bil-
lion grant program, leveraging SBA’s Office of 
Disaster Assistance to provide small busi-
nesses with much needed capital in a timely 
manner. 
Congress intended that these programs 
would provide immediate financial support to 
secure the survival of the small business com-
munity, which is the backbone of the national 
economy. 
As the economic impact of the coronavirus 
pandemic becomes clearer and more far- 
reaching, it will be necessary to replenish the 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Loan program (EIDL) 
funding made available under the CARES Act. 
The legislation before us replenishes these 
funds, and importantly, sets aside a portion of 
those funds be deposited in Community De-
velopment Financial Institutions (CDFIs), mi-
nority depository institutions (MDIs), certified 
development 
companies, 
microloan 
inter-
mediaries, and State or Federal Credit Unions 
to ensure that economically distressed or dis-
advantaged communities have access to the 
capital needed to revive and regenerate their 
local economies. 
Specifically, 
the 
legislation 
before 
us 
strengthens the Paycheck Protection Program 
with $310 billion in additional funding and $50 
billion for SBA disaster lending, translating into 
more than $350 billion in loans, and $10 billion 
in SBA disaster grants. 
Additionally, and importantly, this legislation 
directs that $30 billion be deposited in banks 
and credit unions with less than $10 billion in 
assets, as well as all Community Development 
Financial Institutions (CDFIs), MDIs, certified 
development companies (CDCs), and micro-
lenders that are PPP lenders. 
Madam Speaker, another reason I strongly 
support this legislation is because it provides 
$75 billion to provide hospitals and health care 
workers on the frontlines the necessary re-
sources, especially personal protective equip-
ment (PPE) to battle the coronavirus pan-
demic and care for its victims. 
We have all seen the heart-wrenching sto-
ries of courageous doctors, nurses, ambu-
lance drivers, orderlies, and others selflessly 
striving to save others while putting them-
selves in harm’s way because of the severe 
shortage of PPE. 
Madam Speaker, the current president fan-
cies calling himself a ‘‘War President.’’ 
For anyone who needs reminding, the na-
tion’s greatest wartime presidents made sure 
that American troops on the frontlines were 
trained, equipped, and protected in battle. 
I also support this legislation because it pro-
vides as I requested $25 billion for diagnostic 
testing and contact tracing promised at no 
charge to the person. 
This funding will help states and local juris-
diction conduct necessary COVID–19 testing 
in local jails, juvenile detention centers, and 
elsewhere in the criminal justice system. 
Testing is the key to reopening the economy 
and resuming our lives, and to prevent, pre-
pare for, and respond to coronavirus, domesti-
cally or internationally, for necessary expenses 
to research, develop, validate, manufacture, 
purchase, administer, and expand capacity for 
COVID–19 tests to effectively monitor and 
suppress COVID–19, including tests for both 
active infection and 19 prior exposure. 
If we cannot see where COVID–19 is within 
a community, there is no reliable way to pre-
vent its spread other than quarantine. 
If we do not dramatically increase testing, 
we will remain prisoners of COVID–19 until we 
have a vaccine widely available, which is not 
expected to occur until early 2021. 
Universal testing for COVID–19 is a matter 
of life and death for millions of Americans, but 
it is also a salvation for millions of others who 
are living desperate lives behind locked doors. 
The liberation of millions hinges on getting 
testing in every community so that we can 
shine a light on where COVID–19 is and 
where it is not present. 
The lack of testing early on and the contin-
ued lack of testing is costing trillions in lost 
economic output and it will continue to cost 
much more as we struggle to save lives 
through social distancing and providing ade-
quate universal access to COVID–19 needed 
medicines, equipment, and PPE to protect 
medical personnel. 
Madam Speaker, based on the limited data 
available to date, it is clear that African Ameri-
cans are at higher risk of contracting COVID– 
19 and experiencing the worst outcomes. 
An April 2020 analysis by the Washington 
Post of available data and census demo-
graphics shows that counties that are majority- 
black have three times the rate of infections 
and almost six times the rate of deaths as 
counties where white residents are in the ma-
jority. 
Madam Speaker, African Americans are 26 
percent of the population in Milwaukee Coun-
ty, Wisconsin but account for 73 percent of 
COVID–19 related deaths; comparable num-
bers in Chicago, Illinois and Washington, D.C. 
are 32 percent and 46 percent of the popu-
lation but 67 percent and 58 percent of 
COVID–19 deaths respectively. 
Faced with this grim reality, I am particularly 
pleased that the legislation before us directs 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
to collect, publicly release, and report to Con-
gress 
racial 
and 
demographic 
data 
on 
COVID–19 in order to identify and address ra-
cial disparities in the response. 
But Madam Speaker, we all recognize the 
legislation before us is only an interim meas-
ure and more must and will be done to protect 
our nation and make our people whole. 
In the next supplement to the CARES Act, 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
to include the following priorities: 
1. Hero pay for mass transit workers; 
2. Increased childcare direct payment as-
sistance to essential workers; 
3. Additional funding for CDC data collection 
and research regarding disparate impact of 
COVID–19 on African Americans and Latinos; 
4. Expanded Medicaid payments to local 
counties in states that have not accepted the 
expanded Medicaid; 
5. Medical shelters creating extra COVID– 
19 hospital beds to be funded at 100 percent 
so counties like Harris County in my home 
state of Texas is not subsidizing all of its 
neighboring counties; and 
6. Funding for an additional cash distribution 
of $2,000 per adult and $500 per child. 
Madam Speaker, the occasion demands 
that we rise, and I urge all Members to join 
me in voting to pass the Senate Amendment 
to H.R. 266, the Paycheck Protection Program 
and Health Care Enhancement Act. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. FERGUSON), the chief deputy whip, 
a key member of the Committee on 
Ways and Means. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the legislation. 
This is important for our commu-
nities and our small businesses back 
home. We are in a real battle. On one 
front, 
we 
have 
our 
incredible 
healthcare 
workers, 
our 
frontline 
healthcare workers, our first respond-
ers, and hospital administrators that

are fighting out there. And those he-
roes, we owe a debt of gratitude. This 
bill will provide important resources, 
particularly for our rural hospitals. 
But there is an economic disaster as 
well. And I would like to say thank you 
to another group of unexpected heroes 
that are out there working very, very 
hard every single day, and those are 
our community bankers in our small, 
rural communities. 
These bankers have been working 
long hours, helping the small business 
in their communities that they serve. 
And I will tell you, there are going to 
be a lot of stories that come out about 
good things and bad things that happen 
with this program, but I could not be 
more grateful for the men and women 
in our small community banks out 
there putting in long hours, long days, 
doing their dead-level best to help the 
communities that they serve. 
Madam Speaker, again, I ask that all 
colleagues support this legislation. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY), the 
chairperson of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I support this 
bill, which provides an additional $310 
billion for PPP loans. And while this is 
desperately needed, it almost certainly 
will not be enough. 
I am glad that an additional $60 bil-
lion is being set aside for community 
banks, credit unions, minority banks, 
and CDFIs. And as chair of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform, I 
promise I will watch the $60 billion like 
a hawk to make sure that it goes to the 
communities that we intended. 
But I also want to mention another 
key priority: The postal service, which 
is running out of money and must be 
funded soon. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. WALTZ). 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, we are 
hearing a lot today about Democrats 
support this; Republicans support that. 
I don’t think this is the time for that. 
Americans don’t care. They don’t care 
about party. This virus doesn’t care. 
They care about this Congress getting 
things done and about America pulling 
through. 
This is a good day for our businesses, 
for our hospitals, but I think a silver 
lining in all of this will be all of us see-
ing America pull together. 
And I think the other silver lining 
will be us drastically changing how we 
view our relationship with China, and 
understanding the Chinese Communist 
Party is not our friend, they are ma-
nipulating international organizations, 
they 
are 
hoarding 
supplies, 
have 
brought manufacturing away from a 
place where we, as America, can ben-
efit. We must bring that manufac-
turing home. We will do that on the 
other side of this. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to intro-
duce legislation today to not only 
bring our pharmaceuticals home, but 
our technology and our business that 
China is preying on right now, as we 
speak. Wake up America. We are in a 
cold war, and we have to do better. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), a fully capa-
ble member of the Committee on Ways 
and Means. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, this 
economic relief package is for small 
businesses, finally. 
I am proud that we also secured $25 
billion to expand testing, with $11 bil-
lion to increase State and local testing 
capacity; $1 billion for the CDC, $1.8 
billion for the NIH, $1 billion for 
BARDA, money for the Food and Drug 
Administration and money for commu-
nity health centers. This is not every-
thing we wanted. 
Next, we need relief for States and lo-
calities, SNAP benefits, paid family 
leave and paid sick days, and the ex-
pansion of the Child Tax Credit. Vote 
‘‘yes’’ to continue working for people. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON), a fellow Texan, and 
key member of the Committee on Ways 
and Means. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
these resources are a lifeline to our fel-
low Americans, whose lives and liveli-
hoods have been turned upside down 
through no fault of their own. 
They aren’t just numbers on some 
government 
spreadsheet. 
They 
are 
healthcare workers who rush to the 
front lines in this battle, risking their 
lives for our safety. They are family 
farmers, independent energy producers, 
and small businesses of all kinds who 
listened to their leaders, did their part, 
made their sacrifices and stayed home, 
shuttered their businesses, all to keep 
their communities and their country 
safe. 
This temporary support will com-
pensate them partly, but more impor-
tantly, will help them get on their feet 
so that they can keep their employees 
on the payroll and off the unemploy-
ment roll. These folks are the heart-
beat of America. They are the lifeblood 
of this economy, and they—not the 
government—will lead one of the great-
est American comebacks in our his-
tory. 
Madam Speaker, let’s suit up, let’s 
strap it on, and let’s get America back 
to work. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), chairperson of the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, H.R. 
266 provides billions of dollars in fund-
ing for small businesses, hospitals, and 
much-needed testing. This is a bill that 
works for the people, not just the fa-
vorite clients of the big banks. 
I have heard from small business 
owners in Riverside County who have 
struggled to receive the help they need 
after the original funds ran dry. This 
bill strengthens the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program by providing an addi-
tional $310 billion to help small busi-
nesses stay afloat. 
Further, this bill ensures that true 
small 
businesses—not 
large, 
multi-
million-dollar corporations—have ac-
cess to these funds. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 266. The 
well-being of the American people de-
pends on it. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I support the legisla-
tion. 
I am grateful that President Donald 
Trump has succeeded with an agree-
ment to address the destructive impact 
of the Wuhan virus. Our families, small 
businesses, and hospitals need this sup-
port to maintain jobs now more than 
ever. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has been successful in supporting small 
businesses in maintaining jobs, already 
saving 30 million jobs. A real-world ex-
ample of success was on Fox Business 
News last week with Melissa Francis 
interviewing Bill Dukes of the Blue 
Marlin restaurant in Columbia, prais-
ing Scott Hagler of the Security Fed-
eral Bank for saving jobs. 
This agreement will help families 
but, sadly, there was a delay because of 
partisan politics, letting no disaster go 
to waste. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Mrs. MURPHY), a very capable 
member of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, today’s bill is a positive step 
and has my full support, but it took 
too long. Next time let’s skip the par-
tisan games and just do our jobs. 
We must be aggressive and smart. We 
should spare no expense when it comes 
to testing, treatments, and vaccines. 
And we must support workers and busi-
ness owners who bear no blame for this 
crisis. 
We should keep workers tethered to 
their jobs and to their healthcare. And 
aid should be swift and direct rather 
than through complicated and time- 
consuming programs. For workers who 
do lose their jobs, Congress has pro-
vided billions to support them. 
Sadly, this support has been delayed 
in States like Florida, whose unem-
ployment system is marred by incom-
petence 
and 
indifference. 
Congress 
must demand better. Our country con-
fronts a deadly, serious crisis. As lead-
ers, we must unite to combat COVID– 
19. 
My fellow Blue Dog colleagues and I 
will continue pushing for more bipar-
tisan cooperation to get the job done 
for the American people. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield

(Mr. HURD), a member of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, and a fellow 
Texan. 
Mr. HURD of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
134,700—that is the number of small 
businesses in my home State of Texas 
that have received Paycheck Protec-
tion Program loans amounting to more 
than $28.4 billion. 
This money helps small business 
owners catch their breath because they 
didn’t have to fire their employees. 
This money prevented thousands from 
going on unemployment and standing 
in line at already-overrun food banks. 
Madam Speaker, this money has been 
a Band-Aid helping small businesses 
stop bleeding. This program has and 
will help many survive this moment of 
darkness. More funding for PPP will 
save jobs. More funding for testing will 
save lives. Let’s get it done. No more 
delays. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud a solu-
tion to add funds to this program fi-
nally came about, but I am dis-
appointed partisanship delayed it. Our 
neighbors and communities are step-
ping up and working together to help 
one another. Congress should follow 
that lead. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. BERA). 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, we are 
in the middle of a global pandemic. 
This isn’t a Republican virus or Demo-
cratic virus. It doesn’t recognize the 
color of your skin or the country of 
your origin. It doesn’t know what god 
you worship. 
We are in this together, not just as a 
city, a State, a country. We are in this 
together—all of us—and we will get out 
of this together. Let’s find our human 
kindness and our better nature. We will 
persevere. We will be more resilient. 
And we will come out stronger and 
kinder and gentler.

Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. WAGNER), a member of the 
Financial Services Committee. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
am here today to call on colleagues to 
support the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram and Health Care Enhancement 
Act, legislation that is poised to be a 
lifeline to my constituents in Mis-
souri’s Second Congressional District 
during this pandemic. 
This bill includes $310 billion in in-
creased funding for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, a program that has 
helped keep open thousands of Missouri 
businesses, including Martha’s Hands, 
a St. Louis-based home healthcare pro-
vider with over 200 employees. My of-
fice worked with Martha’s Hands to se-
cure these vital PPP funds so that they 
will be able to pay their employees and 
keep their doors open to help the most 
fragile in our community. 
There are small businesses and work-
ers just like them all over that are de-
pendent. They are the backbone of our 
economy. 
Madam Speaker, we fought to also 
include $75 billion for hospitals and 
healthcare providers so the frontline 
healthcare heroes are taken care of and 
$25 billion for critical COVID–19 testing 
so we can better understand the spread 
of this virus, to save lives, and to have 
the confidence to reopen our commu-
nities. 
Madam Speaker, I urgently ask ev-
eryone to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, to-
day’s bill is critical for small busi-
nesses in my district that are des-
perately waiting for this financial life-
line. 
The funding for testing is also crit-
ical as our country is woefully behind. 
We need 10 to 20 times current levels of 
testing to know who is infected and 
isolate them and to find emerging hot 
spots. Without that, we are flying 
blind, and we will see new surges. Wide-
spread testing is key to moving for-
ward. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mon-
tana (Mr. GIANFORTE). 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of reopening the 
Paycheck Protection Program after an 
unnecessary lapse in funding. 
In just 2 weeks after the launch, the 
program provided over 13,000 loans in 
Montana, totaling $1.4 billion. It has 
helped small businesses stay open and 
keep workers on the payroll. 
But as the well quickly ran dry on 
this critical lifeline for small busi-
nesses and workers, the Speaker and 
the Senate Democratic Leader, CHUCK 
SCHUMER, stood on the sidelines and 
failed to work with Republicans to 
keep this program running. 
When 
Senate 
Majority 
Leader 
MCCONNELL moved to increase funding, 
Democrats objected, refusing to allow 
immediate action. That is outrageous. 
At last, we are doing the right thing 
by small businesses and workers, but it 
is overdue, and it has been needlessly 
held up with partisan games. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with 
small businesses and workers today 
and pass the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. MCADAMS). 
Mr. 
MCADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Utah families are suffering and wor-
rying about how they are going to sur-
vive this crisis financially. This legis-
lation provides additional funds for the 
Paycheck Protection Program to cover 
payroll and other essential expenses for 
small businesses, and it keeps pay-
checks coming for employees. We must 
make sure that this money makes it to 
the small businesses and hardworking 
families that deserve it. 
This bill also provides critical sup-
port to our hospitals that are saving 
lives and money for testing so we can 
move safely and responsibly to reopen 
the economy. 
This is critical economic support. I 
support this bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), a member of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, for 
America’s struggling small businesses, 
there is just no substitute for safely re-
opening the economy; but until that 
happens, the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram is a lifeline. 
The first wave of funding delivered 
$350 billion in forgivable loans to 1.6 
million firms nationwide, including 
over $4 billion to save jobs in my home 
State of Kentucky. 
For the Wells family at Green Tree 
Forest Products, the funds meant that 
they could keep their sawmill open and 
retain 93 employees in eastern Ken-
tucky. 
For Upper Right Marketing, a Lex-
ington tourism company impacted by 
the postponement of the Kentucky 
Derby and the closure of the Kentucky 
Bourbon Trail, funding arrived the day 
before the company was set to lay off 
30 employees. 
So it is unfortunate that some in this 
House dithered the last 7 days, making 
partisan demands after the program 
ran out of money and an additional 41⁄2 
million Americans filed for unemploy-
ment. 
But today’s replenishment of funding 
restores hope for workers, families, and 
business owners, including Dennis from 
Lexington, who has operated a car re-
pair shop for 17 years, has 10 employ-
ees, but has yet to receive a loan. 
Congress must ensure that, by flat-
tening the curve, we don’t flatten 
small business with it. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, let me 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has 31 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Texas has 241⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. CRAIG). 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support today for America and 
Minnesota’s small businesses. 
Whether it is a florist in Apple Val-
ley, the Cannon River Winery, or a food 
shelf in Eagan, I have heard the urgent 
need for funding assistance to survive 
the impacts of COVID–19. But we must 
do more. 
I am grateful that we are going to 
add additional support to small busi-
nesses and nonprofits by funding the 
Paycheck Protection Program and the 
Economic Injury Disaster Loan Pro-
gram today to keep small businesses 
and the American Dream alive. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield

(Mr. CRENSHAW).

H1936 
April 23, 2020 
week ago when the Treasury warned us 
that the small business program need-
ed refunding. It is a program we al-
ready authorized. It is a program that 
Americans need desperately to keep 
their payrolls whole during this crisis. 
But, in predictable fashion, it was de-
layed. My colleagues will claim victory 
for this delay, claiming ‘‘wins’’ for ad-
ditional funding. But they know that 
this vote today could have easily been 
agreed to last week. 
We are asking our grocers to stock 
our shelves, truckers to drive, and 
nurses and doctors to risk their lives, 
but Congress can’t even bother to vote 
to help small businesses in time. In 
fact, many want to vote from home or 
by proxy. If you think that is leader-
ship, then I would encourage you to 
rethink what it means to be a Rep-
resentative. 
Leadership is courage to lead from 
the front. It is steadfast judgment free 
from cynical opportunism. Leadership 
means acting worthy of the people we 
represent. If we are to survive this his-
toric crisis, we might collectively 
stiffen our spines and demonstrate to 
the American people what that looks 
like. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support this interim package. 
I have spent every day in my district 
speaking to constituents and stake-
holders battered by this health and 
economic crisis. I am grateful to 
Speaker PELOSI and Democratic col-
leagues 
who 
fought 
for 
additional 
money for small businesses, fixed prob-
lems we saw after the first round of 
funding, and added money for hos-
pitals. 
I am disappointed by Republican col-
leagues who refused to include local 
and State governments, but we will 
keep fighting for them and so many 
others who were left out. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Republican 
Whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Texas for 
yielding. 
Most importantly, I want to thank 
all 
of 
those 
hardworking 
families 
across this country, people who are 
struggling through this crisis, who are 
adhering to the guidance from the 
President and their Governors. But 
they want us to get back to work. They 
want us to work together to help them 
through this critical time, to focus on 
finding a cure as we are seeing so many 
advances in medicine, on testing, and 
on therapies that may work. 
In the meantime, we are all learning 
how to deal with this disease better, 
how to socially distance. Even if you 
go to the grocery store now, people are 
being more cautious. 
We also need to make sure that we 
help those families hold on through 
this time, that we help those small 
businesses that are struggling through 
this time. The Paycheck Protection 
Program has been incredibly successful 
as a lifeline to those small businesses. 
President Trump called on us weeks 
ago to come and replenish this fund 
that has been used by so many busi-
nesses to hang on, and yet there were 
cries from the other side. In fact, one 
of the leaders of the main caucus on 
the opposition side called the Pay-
check Protection Program leverage, 
that they should hold out from re-fund-
ing to get other things. 
This isn’t about leveraging families 
who are struggling and hanging on and 
businesses that barely can make it 
while you try to go for other items. 
Help those people who are in need. Ne-
gotiate on other things that we can get 
agreement on, but don’t hold hostages 
during this time. 
I reached out to so many small busi-
nesses and heard from people in my dis-
trict and all around this country. We 
saw another 4.4 million people lose 
their jobs just this week, and yet there 
were businesses holding on, waiting for 
this money that didn’t get it for the 
last 2 weeks while this leverage game 
was played. 
I just talked to one company, Delta 
Electronics in Harvey, Louisiana: ‘‘We 
laid off two of our three employees. 
. . . We are about 7 days away from 
shutting our doors down for good and 
possibly declaring bankruptcy.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Louisiana an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. SCALISE. ‘‘We are about 7 days 
away from shutting our doors down for 
good and possibly declaring bank-
ruptcy. We don’t know what else to do. 
I’m tired of crying myself to sleep 
every night wondering what tomorrow 
holds. Will we lose everything we 
worked for? Our house? Our retire-
ment?’’ 
‘‘Enough is enough.’’ 
They had to wait an extra 2 weeks. 
Hopefully, that company can hold on. 
MJ’s Grill in Columbia, South Caro-
lina: ‘‘We are a small, family-run res-
taurant that has a staff of 16. We have 
had to cut our staffing down to eight 
and those employees work limited 
hours. I open and close the kitchen 
every day without taking a paycheck 
to try and keep the doors open. We are 
quickly approaching the hard-line deci-
sion of closing our doors permanently.’’ 
These are stories that go on and on, 
heartbreaking stories from businesses 
that just want to hold on to keep their 
family business going, to keep those 
employees, that represent millions of 
people. 
Stop thinking of them as leverage 
and start thinking of them as our 
neighbors. Just like we applaud our 
frontline workers, the men and women 
in the hospitals, the nurses, the doc-
tors who are keeping us safe, let’s work 
to keep everybody safe and get through 
this and open our economy back again. 
Let’s pass this bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. 
RUIZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
coronavirus has upended life as we 
know it. 
Healthcare workers need personal 
protective equipment and hospitals 
need supplies. 
Small businesses and small farmers 
need financial security to weather this 
storm. 
America needs a national testing re-
gime to safely and efficiently get this 
country back to work. 
Underserved rural communities need 
doctors and increased access to care. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
and Health Care Enhancement Act will 
provide much-needed relief to millions 
across the country and help save lives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from California another 
10 seconds. 
Mr. RUIZ. Because of the urgency, I 
urge you to vote ‘‘yes.’’ However, State 
and local governments and Tribal na-
tions across the country need funding, 
too, to provide essential services for 
our essential frontline workers: para-
medics, law enforcement, firefighters. 
We must include the Coronavirus Re-
lief Act, $250 billion for local govern-
ment for populations less than 500,000 
in the next act because small cities’ 
firefighters and paramedics in my dis-
trict matter, too. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, in New Jersey, 100,000 people 
have tested positive for COVID–19, with 
more than 5,000 suffering death. Forty 
percent of those who have died are 
women and men in nursing homes and 
veterans in long-term care homes. We 
grieve their loss. 
My constituents have shown remark-
able strength, resolve, and resiliency, 
especially those in healthcare, first re-
sponders, postal workers, truckers, su-
permarket employees, and more. With-
out their courage and sacrifice, things 
would be far worse. 
Signs outside of CentraState Medical 
Center in Freehold say it all: Heroes 
Work Here. 
For our hospitals, the $70 billion in 
this legislation, on top of the $100 bil-
lion for the CARES Act, is critically 
needed to sustain our overworked, 
cash-starved hospitals that risk insol-
vency, in large part, because they have 
been compelled by law to postpone 
elective surgeries. 
A few days ago, Secretary Mnuchin 
said 30 million jobs have been saved by 
the Paycheck Protection Program, the 
PPP. Today’s $310 billion replenish-
ment continues and expands this his-
toric bridge to assist businesses with 
forgivable loans to prevent layoffs and 
bankruptcy.

York (Ms. CLARKE), the vice chair of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to stand up for 
the 15,000-plus New Yorkers and thou-
sands of Americans who have lost their 
lives due to the coronavirus and to 
stand up for the tens of thousands of 
healthcare and essential community 
workers whose lives are on the line as 
I stand here. 
Today, we are voting on a $480 billion 
interim relief package that includes 
$370 billion for small business loans and 
grants, $60 billion of which will go to 
mom-and-pop, underbanked, and cash- 
and-carry, $75 billion for hospitals and 
healthcare facilities and $25 billion for 
a national testing strategy. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), a key member 
of the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
how many of us have had the phone 
calls over the last couple of weeks 
where we are talking to that small bus-
inessperson, and you can almost hear 
the tears on the other side of the call? 
You can hear the stress, almost panic 
that they are about to hurt the very 
people that they work with, because 
their business is failing, because they 
are desperate for what we made a 
promise to do, that payroll protection 
money that functionally ran out a cou-
ple of weeks ago. We knew the math, 
and we engaged in a type of cruelty 
around here because we sat here and 
engaged in partisan—we are better 
than this. We knew what we had to do. 
Let’s never do this again. 
For Arizona, what we are about to 
vote on is 202,000 jobs. And the fact of 
the matter is, they should have had 
those two weeks ago. Let’s make this 
happen. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, with all due respect to the Presi-
dent, if you want to make America 
great again, Mr. President, have the 
Senate pass a bill to protect first re-
sponders by sending money to local 
governments. 
If you want to make America great 
again, put money in the pockets of the 
persons who are in food lines miles 
long so that they can feed their fami-
lies. 
If you want to make America great 
again, admit that what you said was a 
hoax and let the healthcare workers 
and 
advisors 
give 
the 
advice 
on 
healthcare. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). Members are reminded 
to address their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, you 
may also remind Members that we are 
not to engage in personalities on the 
House floor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GON-
ZALEZ), a leader in the Financial Serv-
ices Committee. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Pay-
check Protection Program and Health 
Care Enhancement Act. 
Throughout this crisis, our small 
businesses have done everything we 
have asked, and it is past time that we 
add this necessary funding to help 
them maintain payroll and survive this 
crisis. 
But we all know that this cannot be 
the end of our work in response to 
COVID–19. Local leaders across my 
northeast Ohio district have made it 
clear that their finances are in dire 
shape. This is forcing difficult deci-
sions about essential services, includ-
ing fire departments and police offi-
cers. 
While we should not bail out badly 
run States and cities, it is vital that 
we provide targeted funding to munici-
palities like Parma, North Canton, Me-
dina, Orrville, Rootstown, and Green, 
municipalities that have done things 
the right way and need our help. 
I look forward to working with all of 
my colleagues on this. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN). 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, I sup-
port the bill before us today, but we all 
know it is not enough. Much more 
must be done. In the next comprehen-
sive aid package, we must put people 
first. 
But something also must be done 
about the horrific Federal response to 
testing. FEMA and the Trump adminis-
tration have been nonexistent in get-
ting States like Wisconsin the test 
kits, reagents, and PPE we need to re-
open. 
If the President forces us to open too 
soon, more people will get sick and die, 
and the economy will suffer, and that 
will be on the President’s hands. 
This isn’t a reality show. American 
lives are at stake. Get us our supplies 
now. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. WALORSKI), a key leader of 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
want to give a shout-out to the 
healthcare workers in Indiana’s Second 
District while I am standing here sup-
porting this legislation. What a phe-
nomenal job and risk they have taken. 
I am supporting this legislation 
today, but this delay was long, too 
long, completely avoidable. Two weeks 
ago, Democrats blocked attempts to re-
plenish PPP and ensure small busi-
nesses could continue making payroll 
and rent. They said there was no data 
supporting more funding, even though 
the program ran out of money only a 
week later. 
PPP has helped so many small busi-
nesses across my district save jobs. But 
others have been waiting for loans they 
urgently 
needed 
while 
Democrats 
played games with workers’ liveli-
hoods. 
As one frustrated small business 
owner wrote to me: I saw the Speaker 
laughing it up on late night television, 
showing off her stash of high-end ice 
cream, while I and other small business 
owners don’t know how we will make 
the next payroll. 
I tell you what, ladies and gentle-
men: Times are tough. Small business 
needs everything we can give them in a 
bipartisan way. I strongly urge support 
of this bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
don’t know what my friend from Indi-
ana is talking about. 
I do know this: Thank God the Demo-
crats insisted that this bill help the 
small businesses intended to be sup-
ported. Too many big guys got sup-
ported over the little guys, and that is 
what we are trying to fight for today. 
Second point, we have got to help 
State and local governments. They 
cannot be allowed to go bankrupt. That 
is social Darwinism at its worst. 
And, thirdly, we have got to help our 
postal workers and the Postal Service 
who serve all Americans. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. ESTES), a key member of the Ways 
and Means Committee. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, 2 weeks 
ago, my Republican colleagues and I 
asked for more funding for the Pay-
check Protection Program. More than 
1.6 million small businesses and their 
employees 
were 
helped 
before 
the 
money ran out, including $4.3 billion in 
PPP loans for more than 26,000 small 
businesses in Kansas. 
Now, hundreds of thousands of appli-
cations sit, because Congress would not 
act in time. As a result, small business 
owners are laying off employees, they 
are losing the businesses that they 
worked so hard to build. 
This bill will save 201,000 Kansas jobs. 
While late, this bill provides more 
funding to the program, representing a 
small step towards reopening America. 
This money will save businesses and 
jobs and allows more hardworking 
Americans to provide for their fami-
lies. 
Increased testing is a vital step in 
our return to normalcy. This bill pro-
vides $75 billion for healthcare pro-
viders and another $25 billion for test-
ing capacity to combat the virus. Test-
ing is critical to reopening Kansas and 
getting America going again. 
Today, I am grateful for the Ameri-
cans who stepped up to help their 
neighbors in this unprecedented time, 
and I will continue to show up for Kan-
sas by supporting this legislation. 
Mr. NEAL. I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER), chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, small 
businesses in my district are desperate 
for assistance, but stymied by a lack of 
funding and unfair treatment by the 
big banks and the SBA. 
I support this legislation, because it 
is absolutely imperative that we get

small businesses a new round of fund-
ing and support. 
I am also pleased this bill provides 
significant funding for hospitals and 
for expanded testing without which we 
cannot safely reopen the businesses 
and other establishments we are trying 
to save. 
I am disappointed that despite the 
best efforts of my Democratic col-
leagues, the bill does not give State 
and local governments the funding and 
flexibility they desperately need. 
We must provide for these and other 
unmet needs in the next bill. But right 
now, the funds in this bill are des-
perately needed, and we must vote yes. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, we are a 
body of 435 representatives. That is 
true. There is only one that can de-
mand that that gavel go up and down. 
And I have a very simple question for 
this body: Can anybody, will anybody, 
in this body stand and say that the 
Speaker has demanded that we act here 
with the urgency that our people re-
quire, with the urgency that this body 
is capable of? 
You believe this body has acted with 
the urgency we are capable of, that our 
people require? 
I think it is sad that there are people 
that believe that we have acted in ur-
gency. There has been no haste by this 
body. 
It will be said of this time that those 
who could do the most did the least. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). 
Mr. 
PAYNE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman, I thank the 
Speaker, and I would say to my friend 
on the other side of the aisle, there was 
no urgency in February when this was 
first brought to the President’s atten-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to sup-
port the fourth coronavirus stimulus. 
It is good to see both parties can come 
together to aid the country during a 
national crisis. 
But we must have accountability for 
the money that we provide, and we 
must get it to the people that need it 
the most. 
Like many Members, I was not happy 
to hear of small businesses that could 
not get funds. We must do a better job 
in getting the funds to the people that 
need it the most, and that should be 
our commitment. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, the last 
time I stood in this Chamber was the 
first day that my district reported a 
COVID–19 fatality. At that time, on 
March 27, my district had just 27 con-
firmed cases. As of today, the 12th Dis-
trict has 50 deaths and 862 confirmed 
cases. 
COVID–19 has rattled our commu-
nities across this country, and our top 
priority should be and should always be 
keeping people safe. 
But the virus has also forced our 
economy to a grinding halt. Our small 
businesses are desperate for a lifeline. 
And for many, that lifeline is the PPP. 
In Illinois, almost 70,000 loans were 
approved before funding ran out. But 
funding should have never been allowed 
to run out. We should have done our 
job. We should have come back, and 
politics should not have been played. 
The COVID–19 virus is not Repub-
lican; it is not Democrat. This hurting 
economy is not Republican; it is not 
Democrat. But yet we held it up, and 
we will never know how many small 
businesses failed because politics was 
played rather than getting our job 
done. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), the chairman of 
the Democratic messaging committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support the interim relief pack-
age. 
Thanks to the strong leadership of 
the Speaker and our outstanding com-
mittee chairs, this bill helps our small-
est small businesses, our hospitals, and 
a national testing strategy, which were 
not included in Senator MCCONNELL’s 
original bill. So thanks again for their 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, we also have to 
work hard to flatten this curve, and we 
have to do a lot more for America’s 
working families. 
In the next phase of relief, we need to 
include recurring direct cash payments 
to workers, additional small business 
relief, aid to States and cities to pay 
first responders and their healthcare 
heroes that are on the front lines, and 
even more in unemployment benefits. 
Our response must meet the gravity 
of the moment. I hope my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle will join 
with us to make sure we respond to 
this issue in the way that is necessary 
and not resist efforts to help hospitals, 
to help workers, to help expand test-
ing, all of the things we know we need 
to do to defeat this pandemic. 
Thank goodness we stood up. Other-
wise, we wouldn’t have $75 million for 
healthcare workers, $25 million for 
testing, and all of the other things 
which are in this bill to help the small-
est of small businesses. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. SPANO). 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, as the 
sole Florida Member serving on the 
house Small Business Committee, I rise 
today in support of replenishing the 
Paycheck Protection Program. 
While the program is far from per-
fect, it has been undeniably effective. 
Before the original funds were ex-
hausted, 88,000 businesses in my home 
State of Florida received almost $18 
billion in forgivable loans, money that 
saved jobs and businesses, all in just 13 
days. 
Beyond numbers, what is important 
is the people that this program serves. 
I think of a family-owned bowling alley 
that has been in my district for almost 
30 years, one that I took my kids to 
when they were growing up. With their 
PPP loan, they are now able to keep 
and pay their 90 employees and stay in 
business, so now my grandchildren can 
go there, too. 
I think of a home healthcare provider 
that cares for senior citizens. With 
their PPP loan, they have kept a dozen 
employees on the payroll and can con-
tinue to care for our Greatest Genera-
tion. 
While no government program is per-
fect, this one undeniably helps people 
in difficult times, and for that I sup-
port it. 
b 1345 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
The American people are generous 
and strong, and we will get through 
this if we stay united. 
To the mom-and-pop businesses in 
my district that haven’t received a 
dime and the community health cen-
ters struggling to help their patients, 
they are why I got on a flight last 
night, and they are why we need to 
pass this bill today. 
In the weeks ahead, it should be ev-
eryone’s priority in this government to 
help our heroes on the front lines and 
those most in need, regardless of what 
State or city they are in. We are the 
United States of America, and we must 
stay united. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. FORTENBERRY), a key mem-
ber of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Steve called me recently. He has one 
of the businesses that has been hardest 
hit by coronavirus. He is down 90 per-
cent. We talked through some issues. 
Steve decided to fight back. He got in 
line early for the Paycheck Protection 
Program and made a decision to bring 
his employees back, and then he had a 
virtual ribbon cutting where he an-
nounced his reopening. 
Madam Speaker, our country is in 
dire need of some good news, and this 
PPP has been a bright spot in the trau-
ma that we have all faced here. 
Where I live, Madam Speaker, the 
banker knows the farmer, the banker 
knows the barber, the banker knows 
the cafe owner. CPAs, financial advis-
ers, credit unions, we have all pitched 
in. This is what I call community soli-
darity. 
It was clear from the beginning that 
this program would run out of money, 
and we have reached that point. This 
has been a bipartisan airlift, a lifesaver 
for so many people who make things 
with their own two hands and take care 
of others under their employ. I whole-
heartedly support this bill.

Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. KIM). 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, 5,000 of my fellow 
New Jerseyans have died and many 
more will in the weeks to come, and 
still we can’t get enough tests for those 
who need it. 
We are the richest, most powerful 
country in the world, and we are now 
tired of excuses. We need a national 
testing program to let us know if our 
loved ones are healthy or sick so we 
can reopen our country and help our 
small businesses. 
That is our challenge. It is what his-
tory will judge us by. Let’s get it done. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
The current bill provides $12 billion 
to jurisdictions that specifically au-
thorize and encourage the use of sur-
veillance and contact tracing. The bill 
does not define these terms. 
Does it allow big tech companies to 
surveil and trace American citizens 
and then turn that accumulated infor-
mation over to the government? 
How will this data be secured, stored, 
et cetera? 
There are many questions that go un-
answered. Not the least of these, how-
ever, is the question of how much 
longer the American people acquiesce 
to unconstitutional and crushing gov-
ernment action. 
We need to open up America now. I 
call on our Governors to free their citi-
zens immediately. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
The true question we face in this 
pandemic is not when we will get out of 
this crisis, but how we will get out of 
this crisis. And the keys to our eco-
nomic freedom lie in this bill: $25 bil-
lion for testing and monitoring; $75 bil-
lion for treatment, a national testing 
strategy; finally, additional business 
help for our small businesses, including 
$370 billion and $60 billion for our 
smallest, most vulnerable businesses. 
If we commit to continue to focus on 
how to survive this pandemic, then, my 
fellow Americans, we will. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the leader of 
the Republican Conference. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his service. 
Before I begin, I want to thank all of 
us for spending the time to be here 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I want to say to the 
families who are battling this virus or 
to the families who have lost a loved 
one, if we would all pause to think 
about that, not only did they lose a 
loved one, but they couldn’t even be 
near them or with them in their time 
of need. I want them to know, from a 
Republican and Democrat side, for the 
entire Congress: You are in our pray-
ers, and you will stay in our prayers. 
I also want to give a sincere thank- 
you to all of the essential workers on 
the front lines of this crisis, not from 
the Republican leader, but from a very 
grateful nation. 
For the medical professionals, the 
doctors, the nurses, the receptionists, 
we thank you for going to work. We 
know the fear that it brings; we know 
the fear that it brings when you go 
home to your families; and we are 
grateful. 
To the farmers who make sure we 
have food grown in America that is 
safe and the truck drivers who drive 
through the night to replenish the 
stores that we walk in and keep our 
distance to have the food; to the postal 
workers, the warehouse workers, the 
clerks inside those stores who every 
day go to work, you are making a 
meaningful and measurable difference 
in the lives of our entire Nation. 
We will be forever grateful for those 
who kept us safe, kept us healthy, and 
kept us fed. They deserve a government 
that strives to meet that very same 
level of dedication. 
That is the promise I will make: that 
we will bring the same dedication that 
you bring to help others that you don’t 
even know, and we should rise to that 
occasion. This is a commitment we 
make to every American. We will fight 
this virus together until we defeat it 
together. 
We did not ask for this virus. We did 
not invite it. It came from a distant 
land. But together, we will defeat it, 
not only for our country, but for the 
world. 
To do that, Congress must act, and 
we will continue to act even if some in 
this body want to play politics. Even if 
we get something held up, we will stay 
at the table until we bring people to-
gether. 
We want to put people before politics. 
Our entire effort will be bipartisan. 
After all, public health and a strong 
economy are not a Democrat or Repub-
lican issue. 
Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, we 
watched the other side within our own 
Speaker of the House interject politics 
where it did not belong: into an over-
sight body of our necessary relief 
funds. 
Now I want everybody to understand 
what the CARES Act did, the CARES 
Act that got held up for more than a 
week. Yes, at the end of the day it 
changed from that one Sunday night. 
Kennedy Center and others got some 
more money, but it didn’t change for 
what the work was going to be done, 
for the people who needed it. 
Yes, some people, unfortunately, got 
laid off because it was delayed. It 
wasn’t a bright moment for this body 
that week. But inside that CARES Act, 
not only did we provide resources, we 
provided accountability. 
You see, every single committee in 
Congress has an oversight. We have a 
committee just designed for oversight. 
But we wanted to make something to 
make sure it was bipartisan, so we cre-
ated three new entities in the CARES 
Act just for oversight. 
The first is called the Pandemic Re-
sponse Accountability Committee. It is 
made up of inspectors general, not Re-
publicans or Democrats. They are inde-
pendent and professional. 
The second is a Special Inspector 
General for Pandemic Recovery. This 
individual is appointed by the Presi-
dent, confirmed by the Senate, and 
lasts for 5 years. And we gave $25 mil-
lion to make sure they had the re-
sources to make it happen. 
But that wasn’t enough. We created a 
third one. Now, this one is the Congres-
sional 
Oversight 
Commission, 
with 
commissioners. This body is appointed 
by congressional leadership. 
On our side of the aisle, we appointed 
FRENCH
HILL. Why? First, he is a 
statesman. He worked at the Treasury 
Department. He knows things back-
wards and forwards, so they can’t ever 
fool FRENCH HILL. 
I was very excited when I heard, on 
the other side of the aisle, they ap-
pointed DONNA
SHALALA, the former 
Secretary of HHS. 
You see, this body won’t be weighted 
by one side or the other. All four lead-
ers, Republican and Democrat, appoint 
one, so it is equal. 
And then you know what happens for 
a chair? MITCH MCCONNELL and Speak-
er PELOSI decide who to become the 
chair. I think the American public says 
that is right. But they don’t go and 
hide inside a corner. They literally re-
port to Congress every 30 days. 
I was proud of that accomplishment. 
That is what America expects from us: 
no politics, but the very best on there, 
and report back. 
But today, when we come back be-
cause it was delayed, to give small 
business the resources it takes to keep 
people employed, now we added a little 
politics to the game. You see, today, 
we will vote on a new Oversight Com-
mittee. 
Will it be equal? Will it be the same 
number of Republicans and Democrats 
like the congressional one? No. 
Will it be the same when it comes to 
the inspectors general, where it won’t 
care about politics? No, sad to say not. 
You see, this committee will be the 
only committee weighted politically. 
There will be seven Democrats and five 
Republicans. This committee was an-
nounced before they even told the mis-
sion of what this committee should do. 
They even announced the chair of the 
committee. 
Now, I respect the chair greatly, 
Madam Speaker. He has one of the best 
political minds I know. Joe Biden will 
tell you that. You see, our dear friend 
Congressman CLYBURN should be cred-
ited with getting Joe Biden the nomi-
nation. While he failed in all the other 
States, South Carolina was critical.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1940 
April 23, 2020 
He did politics very well in the en-
dorsement. He turned the tide of the 
Democrat nomination. And they will 
have a nominee, and a lot of that will 
go to JIM CLYBURN, and he deserves the 
credit politically for what he was able 
to accomplish. 
We do not question his political abili-
ties. He is the majority whip. He knows 
how to gather votes. He knows how to 
make the political argument. But, 
Madam Speaker, this is the same indi-
vidual who said that the pandemic pre-
sented the perfect opportunity to re-
structure things to fit our own vision. 
I do not question his appointment. I 
wonder why this committee. If that 
was his view, why wasn’t he put on the 
congressional oversight that was equal 
with the number of Republicans and 
the number of Democrats? 
The public does not want to see poli-
tics. Why would we waste our time 
bringing people back to create a polit-
ical committee? I guess the vote will 
tell us differently. 
It is interesting to know why we are 
here. At 8:30 today, we actually found 
the reason, 4.4 million more reasons 
why we are here. How many of those 4.4 
million would not have gotten a pink 
slip last week had we listened more 
than 2 weeks ago, on April 7, when we 
said the program we created that was 
so successful, that was able to do the 
number of loans in 14 days that it took 
the SBA to do in 14 years, that there 
was such a need out there that maybe 
we would overcome politics for that 
one moment. Could it be too much to 
read that it was one simple page? 
I thought there was a moment in 
time it would happen. I thought we 
could say yes on a unanimous consent, 
this is a program we all had just voted 
for and surely just 2 weeks before. 
Yes, that was tough to get that bill 
through. Yes, we had to have it held up 
on the other side. That was wrong that 
other millions were laid off. But this 
was the moment to learn from that 
mistake on the other side before. We 
did not learn. It was played again. 
To those 4.4 million Americans who 
were laid off this week: Congress owes 
you an apology. You did not have to 
have that happen. 
To the small business owner: I under-
stand this greatly. At age 20, I created 
my first business. I know where you 
make these decisions. You make these 
decisions on the kitchen table. 
If you ever had a small business, you 
realize you are the first to work, you 
are the last to leave, and you are the 
last to be paid. You know those who 
work with you are not just employees, 
they are your family. You know their 
children’s names. You are there at 
their weddings; you are there when 
they graduated; and you are proud of 
them. You never want to have to say 
you are going to lay them off. 
They put everything into their busi-
ness to succeed, and government told 
them they had to shut down for the 
health of the Nation. They made a sac-
rifice. But they got sacrificed for poli-
tics last week. 
Shame on this body. 
I have listened to this debate thor-
oughly. I have listened to the other 
side. 
b 1400 
When you look at what we accom-
plished in those 14 days alone, we saved 
30 million jobs. We all could have put a 
tweet out today not having to be in 
here and say we saved 34 million jobs, 
but, no, 4 million more lost because 
somehow people felt good with politics. 
I listened to debate on the other side. 
Some actually said they don’t want to 
be here today: We shouldn’t have folded 
and actually came together. We should 
have used leverage even further, used 
that political leverage to hold people 
up. 
I have even seen some people on the 
other side of the aisle say they loved to 
see it when the price of oil dropped, 
when no one had seen it before, and the 
idea that millions in our energy indus-
try are going to get laid off, too. 
It doesn’t matter about politics. 
There will be Democrats and Repub-
licans both that get laid off. 
Then I listened as we come back 
here, Madam Speaker, and I tried to 
listen to the other side. I tried to un-
derstand: Why would you hold it up? 
What is different? 
I listened to the debates. I listened to 
the leadership talk. It was amazing to 
me. In listening to it, the only thing I 
could think is what Shakespeare would 
say: ‘‘The lady doth protest too much, 
methinks.’’ 
If you have to explain as hard as you 
can and spin with as much political 
might as you can why you laid 4.4 mil-
lion people off because you felt better 
to tell MITCH MCCONNELL that a pro-
gram that put out funds and saved 30 
million jobs, that you were going to 
hold it up to prove a point, that is not 
what I would want to hear in history. 
Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, it 
is our responsibility to act, to put our 
differences aside and do what is right 
for the American public. 
Now more than ever, the American 
people deserve a Congress that acts 
with leadership, dedication, and resil-
ience. Anything we do in this Chamber 
that deals with COVID should be bipar-
tisan, from legislation to deliberation 
to voting. 
Yes, I stayed up until 2 a.m. to see 
what the majority wanted to put for-
ward. We all work hard to get here. We 
all almost have about the same size 
districts, because every 10 years we 
take a Census to figure that out. 
Our constituents make a decision 
every 2 years to lend their voice to the 
person they want to represent them. 
They did not lend their voice to give 
that proxy to somebody else they can-
not hold accountable. They did not 
lend that voice to wait until 2 a.m. to 
change more than 200 years of history 
because somebody wanted to have more 
power than the job of the majority 
themselves. 
We are living in one of the greatest 
turning points in history. This is not a 
time for indifference, selfishness, or di-
vision. 
We are going to help America get 
through this. We are going to do this 
together. In the end, we are going to be 
stronger, healthier, and more united 
than ever before. Why? Because we are 
Americans, and that is who we are. 
This body will raise debates. This 
body plays politics many times, but 
now is not the moment for politics. 
Now is not the moment to say: Let’s 
hold something up even if somebody is 
going to be punished, because somehow 
I will get a political advantage. 
Finally, when people come together, 
the statement should not be: Let’s hold 
more leverage, because it is okay be-
cause, when we come to the floor, we 
will spin it and say it was not us. 
But when we are long gone, history 
will write about this day. They will 
write about that day on April 7 when 
America 
witnessed 
something 
they 
have never seen before, when one stood 
before the Chamber in the Senate and 
requested to add exactly what we are 
doing today to a program to keep peo-
ple hired in all the places we know and 
love in our neighborhood, and one 
party sent two people, in the middle of 
COVID, onto the floor to raise a simple 
hand to say they object. That was the 
only thing holding the money up be-
tween the American public and those 
4.4 million who unfortunately went to 
a different job today: the unemploy-
ment line. 
I don’t know how anybody could be 
proud of that, but, Madam Speaker, I 
am always an optimist. I know what 
has been before us. I know the chal-
lenge. Today, we are going to display 
to the American public that we can 
work just as those truck drivers, those 
medical professionals, the checkers at 
my local Vons, or the paramedic who 
comes when the call is requested. They 
are essential. I think it is essential to 
this country to show we can do our job 
not in a partisan way. 
So when the moment comes, you will 
have two votes. You have already 
voted, all of us here in the Chambers, 
to add three more committees that are 
bipartisan for the accountability of 
this money going forward. The country 
is asking you to keep that together. 
So you will have a choice. Now you 
can cast a new vote to put in some-
thing partisan that we have never seen 
before with an individual who is one of 
the best political minds around, who 
believes that this virus is more about 
restructuring government in their view 
than solving a problem. Then you are 
going to have another vote, a vote to 
continue the funding that we already 
asked for more than 2 weeks ago. 
This time, after twice holding up 
money from the American public, I just 
ask all in this Chamber to learn from 
this. Let’s not hold up again our abil-
ity to help and work in a bipartisan 
manner to not only open this Chamber, 
but to work for the American public 
and solve this problem once and for all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1941 
April 23, 2020 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, a re-
minder that our job here is never to ac-
quiesce to the other Chamber. By any 
objective measurement, this is a much- 
improved piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL), whose heartfelt expres-
sions on behalf of her constituents this 
week were well noted. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, in 
days, we will lose more American lives 
than we lost during the Vietnam war, 
26 million Americans unemployed from 
COVID, body bags piling up, and insuf-
ficient testing and PPE. 
Democrats took a bad Republican 
proposal and we made it better, but 
this is far from enough. CARES four 
has to meet the scale of this crisis with 
a bold paycheck guarantee that stops 
mass 
unemployment, 
an 
essential 
workers package, and State and local 
government funding. 
Every minute, Madam Speaker, is a 
death, a family devastated, a business 
shuttered. We must think and deliver 
better. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
we are here today to replenish the Pay-
check Protection Program, and that is 
a good thing. 
We should have been here last week 
when the program ran out of money, 
and we will be back in the same posi-
tion next week if we don’t fix the PPP. 
There are over 700,000 applications 
currently in the queue, and if the 
Treasury Department does not estab-
lish guardrails to differentiate between 
well-capitalized brokerage firms and 
undercapitalized mom-and-pop shops, 
we will not be helping the people who 
need us the most right now. 
We need to get these small businesses 
and nonprofits every single penny they 
need to survive, and we must hold 
China accountable for every single 
penny. 
Madam Speaker, this is not the time 
to be attacking each other. We must 
get through this crisis together. We 
must have each other’s back. Let’s 
have each other’s back. Let’s think 
with our hearts and our heads, and let’s 
march through this together. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this economic boost 
is desperately needed as our Nation sits 
on such a dangerous precipice. 
The bill offers hope to millions and 
millions of Americans, our small busi-
nesses, hospitals, and those on the 
front lines, yet I am troubled by the 
limited insight into how the last $2 
trillion was spent and why so much has 
yet to be disbursed. It seems little 
went to those who need it most, while 
those with access had their takings. 
Unfortunately, 
today’s 
bill 
dras-
tically shortchanges America’s local 
communities and first responders as 
calls and pressure to reopen mount. 
Without data, it is shortsighted. It also 
offers no assistance to our postal serv-
ice, whose jobs hang in the balance. 
Madam Speaker, Congress must move 
America forward a step at a time. 
Lives are at stake. I urge my col-
leagues to vote for this important bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
for yielding. 
This bill is a Band-Aid, and it doesn’t 
even cover the wound. It is better than 
no bandage, but it won’t stop the bleed-
ing in our economy, and it won’t stop 
this virus. 
In light of COVID–19 and the reaction 
to it, Congress urgently needs to lead 
by example and get into full session 
safely, but fully functional, laser fo-
cused, 24/7, in full compliance with the 
House rules for debate, amendment, 
and voting. 
Every one of us has a duty to balance 
and consider public health and our 
economy, but every single one of us 
swore an oath to support and defend 
our Constitution, to defend freedom 
and represent our constituents. 
It is time to support and defend it. It 
is time for us to occupy this House and 
man our duty station and win. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM). 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, 
today I will vote to extend a lifeline to 
small businesses, shore up our hos-
pitals, and expand testing so we can re-
open our economy, but it is unaccept-
able that it has taken this long. 
Supporting hospitals and small busi-
nesses is not partisan, but, again, poli-
tics is obstructing policy. 
This bill fails to ensure relief goes 
only to small businesses that need it 
most instead of large corporations, nor 
does it help States respond to this un-
precedented crisis. 
We cannot wait until the next dis-
aster forces both sides to the table. Our 
constituents deserve more from their 
Representatives. Let’s come together 
and get our country back to work. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CAS-
TOR of Florida). Without objection, the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON) 
controls the time of the gentleman 
from Texas. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. NOR-
MAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to support a lifeline for our 
small businesses, for our first respond-
ers, for our hospitals, but I also rise 
today to say now is the time to stop 
writing checks on money we don’t have 
that is mortgaging the future of this 
great country. I was not sent here to 
bankrupt this country. 
Secondly, we need to get our busi-
nesses to open the doors and do what 
Americans have always been allowed to 
do, which is go to work. Now is the 
time. There is one person who can do 
that, and that is the Speaker of the 
House. I urge her to get us back to 
work. 
We are getting paid; many Americans 
are not. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I have heard a number of people, in-
cluding my friend, the minority leader, 
stand up and say we need to act in a bi-
partisan fashion, and the next state-
ment is a partisan attack on one of our 
Members. It is either schizophrenia or 
a lack of understanding of what this 
Congress has been doing over the last 
few weeks. 
I don’t know about you, Madam 
Speaker, but I have been working 6 
hours, 7 hours on the phone and an-
other 3 or 4 hours reviewing the mate-
rials that have gotten us here today. 
Why did it take so long? Because it 
took 2 weeks for my Republican col-
leagues—and this is a partisan state-
ment, I understand that, but I think we 
ought to all be realistic. 
We are all trying to get to a place 
where America and Americans are safe 
and where our economy is working, be-
cause the statistics we see are statis-
tics of pain and of fear and of anxiety 
about tomorrow. 
b 1415 
So what have we been doing? We have 
been on the phone with one another. I 
have talked to the minority leader nu-
merous times over the last 2 weeks, not 
only on this particular piece of legisla-
tion, but on the process going forward. 
So if anybody on that side is saying 
that Congress is not working, they 
must be speaking for themselves, be-
cause every one of these colleagues on 
my side of the aisle—and I believe on 
their side of the aisle—has been work-
ing very hard: in touch with their local 
government, in touch with their Gov-
ernor, in touch with their healthcare 
delivery people, anybody who works in 
a hospital or a healthcare center or a 
federally qualified health center. They 
are working hard. 
Let us not denigrate ourselves or this 
institution or our commitment to the 
American people because that is bla-
tant partisanship. 
We waited 2 weeks, Madam Speaker, 
that is correct. What for? So that the 
proposal that we made 2 weeks ago—or 
3 weeks ago—which has now effectively 
been 
accepted 
by 
the 
Republicans 
would be accepted. That is what we 
waited for. 
And what did we get? $120 billion ad-
ditional money for small business. And 
be assured, we are talking about for 
the small business. What this bill does 
is puts $120 billion, in addition, $370 bil-
lion, for small business. 
Now, we are talking about biparti-
sanship. The first bill we did dealing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1942 
April 23, 2020 
with coronavirus on this floor passed 
415–2. It doesn’t sound like partisanship 
to me. It sounds like we came together 
and agreed on how we could help. And 
it wasn’t enough. 
And then on phase two, which we 
passed on March 14, 10 days later, is 
Congress not working? Ten days later, 
we passed 363–40. It doesn’t sound like 
partisanship to me. 
And then phase three we passed on 
March 27, 13 days later, on a voice vote, 
with only one Member in the Senate or 
the House demurring. 
It doesn’t sound like partisanship to 
me, Madam Speaker, and I don’t think 
today’s vote will be a partisan vote. I 
certainly hope it will not be. 
Why? Because for the last 2 weeks, 
we have been working with one another 
to try to get to a place where we think 
we are giving the needed resources, be-
cause we think the initial request was 
shortchanging hospitals, shortchanging 
testing. 
It 
still 
shortchanges 
our 
States and local government, and so we 
will need another bill to try to get 
there. 
Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the 
Senate came together to pass this leg-
islation in a bipartisan way. Now, un-
like the House, no Senators came to 
the floor except three or four. They did 
it by unanimous consent. We are not 
able to do that—although I think this 
bill will pass overwhelmingly—because 
some of our Republican friends wanted 
to vote. 
Fine. We are here. We are wearing 
masks. I am not wearing a mask while 
I am speaking, but as soon as I stop 
speaking, I am going to put my mask 
back on as I turn around to go among 
us. Congress is doing its job. 
And I want to tell the American peo-
ple one more time: Members are work-
ing daily to respond to the coronavirus 
that is putting our people and our 
country and our economy at risk. 
Last month, we enacted emergency 
legislation that included more than $2 
trillion in assistance for workers, vet-
erans, small businesses, healthcare sys-
tems, and communities dealing with 
the spread of coronavirus. One of the 
programs we created together was the 
Paycheck Protection Program to try 
to keep people on a payroll, even if 
they could not go to work because 
health professionals say don’t con-
gregate. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
provides loans to small businesses that 
will be forgiven—that will be for-
given—if they keep their workers on 
the payroll. The need was so great that 
the initial $350 billion, as has been 
pointed out, in funding, Madam Speak-
er, was exhausted in a matter of days. 
So, today, we are providing another 
$310 billion for that program, and an 
additional $60 billion for the most at- 
risk small businesses. 
Critically, $60 billion of that, as I 
just said, will be set aside for smaller 
banks where they focus on community 
development 
financial 
institutions 
that service businesses in rural and mi-
nority communities that were left out 
of the initial program. 
I bet if you ask your small businesses 
or rural people, your hospitals or those 
State officials who are saying testing 
is essential, I bet they would say: I am 
glad you waited because you got us re-
sources that we needed. 
That wasn’t in the initial proposal, of 
course, that came from the administra-
tion, and it was objected to, and the 
leader in the Senate would not provide 
for such sums. 
More help is still needed, of course, 
for nonprofits as well as small and mi-
nority-owned 
businesses, 
those 
in 
underbanked communities and the self- 
employed. Those must be, Madam 
Speaker, priorities in the next bill 
that, clearly, is going to be necessary. 
In addition to the increased funding 
for the Paycheck Protection Program, 
Democrats insisted on recapitalizing 
economic injury disaster loans as well, 
providing an additional $60 billion for 
this program, which can be leveraged 
to $300 billion. 
Yes, we asked for, we worked for, we 
negotiated to get small businesses, mi-
nority 
businesses, 
businesses 
that 
couldn’t get into the system that the 
other bigger businesses got in—some so 
big that they were ashamed and gave 
the money back. 
We are also providing an additional 
$75 billion for hospitals and, crucially, 
$25 billion for testing. 
I guarantee you, not one of your hos-
pitals is going to call you up and say: 
You should have acted sooner and not 
had the hospitals in there—not one of 
them. And no Governor or county exec-
utive or mayor or county commis-
sioner or county council person is 
going to say: Gee whiz, we didn’t want 
that money for testing. 
We will not be able to return our 
economy to normal operations, Madam 
Speaker, without a robust testing sys-
tem in place to know we can safely go 
to work without putting workers at 
risk and to identify those who have 
coronavirus so we can take necessary 
steps to isolate them and trace those 
with whom they came in contact, be-
cause that is how we win this battle. 
This bill is an interim step, the 
fourth interim step as we continue to 
work on the next major piece of legis-
lation. I hope we can include, by the 
way, Madam Speaker, in the next bill, 
provisions that, unfortunately, we were 
unable to secure in this bill. 
First of all, we shortchanged—we are 
all in the Nation’s Capital. Millions of 
Americans come here, and we gave Wy-
oming and Vermont—small States, less 
population than the District of Colum-
bia, the Nation’s Capital, to which mil-
lions of your constituents will come. 
We shortchanged them by giving them 
40 percent of what we gave the smallest 
States, smaller than the District of Co-
lumbia. 
We wanted to add that $700 million in 
this bill. Unfortunately, we couldn’t 
get agreement on that. I think that 
was penny-wise and pound-foolish for 
those of us who want our constituents 
to visit Washington to see their gov-
ernment. 
We also must include more help for 
State and local governments. They 
have been on the front lines of fighting 
this scourge and, as a result, have 
spent a lot of resources they budgeted 
for other issues, including employees, 
including police and fire and health 
workers. We need to do that. We want-
ed to do it in this bill. But those of you 
who argue for delay, I will bet that you 
are going to vote in the next tranche 
for additional State and local help— 
maybe not all of you. Why you are de-
laying that help is beyond me. 
This, by the way, is not an abstract 
accounting problem. We are talking 
about States and counties across the 
country being able to keep teachers, 
first responders as tax revenues col-
lapse due to the necessary social 
distancing. 
This pandemic, Madam Speaker, has 
shown a spotlight on the stark dispari-
ties in health status and treatment of 
African Americans in particular and 
minority communities in general. That 
reality is an indefensible and unaccept-
able one. 
While we do include new ways of 
tracking certain data relating to racial 
disparities in this pandemic, there is 
more we must do, not simply for those 
who are at greater risk, but for all of 
us who wear a mask; not because we 
don’t want to be with one another, but 
because this pandemic has made us a 
risk to others, to our neighbors, our 
friends, our family. 
Furthermore, we need to do more to 
protect our elections. My Governor has 
ordered that an election that is coming 
up next Tuesday be all by mail. Now, in 
Wisconsin, the Governor tried to do 
that and Republicans fought us. The 
Republican speaker of the Wisconsin 
House was covered from head to toe in 
a gown, super mask, and gloves. 
Do we want to ask all of our citizens 
to be so at risk because they are exer-
cising their franchise to vote in Amer-
ica? I surely think that is not the case. 
And so we need some additional 
money 
to 
facilitate, 
because 
they 
didn’t plan on it, because they didn’t 
plan on this pandemic, to allow our 
citizens to vote, to encourage them to 
vote, to facilitate their vote, to wel-
come their vote, and to provide for a 
way that they can do it safely without 
endangering themselves or others. 
Furthermore, we need to do more to 
protect our elections in this adminis-
tration. I am glad that the House is 
moving forward today with the cre-
ation of a select committee to oversee 
the coronavirus response. 
Now, my friends on the other side of 
the aisle had eight different partisan 
commissions overseeing what happened 
in Benghazi where four American lives 
were tragically lost. 44,575 Americans 
have lost their lives. Is it too much to 
ask that we would have a special com-
mittee to make sure that the money 
that we are appropriating in historic 
amounts is spent correctly?

H1943 
April 23, 2020 
Congress has a responsibility to en-
sure that the extraordinary sums we 
have authorized and appropriated are 
disbursed efficiently and consistent 
with our intent. Such great sums can 
not only be a source of economic recov-
ery, but, surely, everyone on this floor 
knows that that sum of money on the 
table can also be a magnet for waste, 
fraud, abuse, and, yes, criminality. We 
owe the American people, as we appro-
priate unbelievable sums, to make sure 
that the American people are the ones 
advantaged. 
Any time Congress spends taxpayer 
money, 
particularly 
in 
such 
large 
amounts, we owe it to the American 
people to know where that money is 
going and to ensure that it is being 
spent as directed. 
Now, I know the President of the 
United States said he is going to do the 
oversight. I don’t think that is what 
the Framers had in mind in terms of 
checks and balances. 
And in the most efficient and ethical 
ways possible, we must know which 
programs are working best, which 
aren’t, and that way we can modify 
what we do in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Speaker PELOSI. I want to thank the 
chair of the Small Business Com-
mittee, and I want to thank the chair 
of the Financial Services Committee. I 
want to thank the chair of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee. 
I want to thank Mr. NEAL, who is on 
the floor, and many other chairs, Mr. 
PETERSON, who is very nervous about 
not having a nutrition program in this 
bill, which we wanted. That would have 
delayed it further because, of course, 
we didn’t get support on the other side 
of the aisle for that. But people are in 
incredibly long food lines because their 
nutritional health, as well as their psy-
chological health, is at risk because 
they can’t get food. 
b 1430 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for having 
the courage and the wisdom to stand 
up and say, ‘‘We need these items.’’ 
And we have gotten a lot of them. We 
asked for $500 billion total. This is $484 
billion total. 
My, my, my, you held out for 2 weeks 
for a $16 billion savings. 
I also thank our Members who have 
been working—let me repeat this once 
again, Madam Speaker. These Mem-
bers, those Members, have been work-
ing round-the-clock to make sure their 
communities are safe, to make sure 
their hospitals are getting what they 
need, to make sure that their teachers 
are teaching kids at home. Everybody 
has been working hard. You may not 
see us, but millions and millions and 
millions of Americans are working at 
home. They are teleworking. That is 
essentially what we have been doing— 
teleworking. And don’t tell them they 
are not working, because they know 
they are working. They have been a 
credit to their districts. Every Mem-
ber—Republican, Democrat—I presume, 
and I only know about the Democrats— 
225 of our 234 have been on the phone 
21⁄2 hours a day talking back and forth 
between one another to see what poli-
cies we need. They have been a credit 
to their districts, to the institutions of 
the House and this Nation, spending 
hours on the phone, through video-
conference, making sure that Congress 
is doing its job, and talking to State 
and local leaders and healthcare pro-
viders. 
Let me thank the Members and staff 
who volunteered to be here on the 
floor. We will go off the floor and we 
won’t be as exposed as they are. They 
are all wearing masks. They are wear-
ing masks because they know there is 
a risk. Perhaps not as great a risk as 
those courageous individuals who work 
in our hospitals and our healthcare 
providers in many different modes, but 
courageous and patriotic, nonetheless. 
Thank you, staff. 
I thank those who are working in our 
grocery stores, our police, our fire, our 
truck drivers, who are getting food and 
products from here to there; EMS per-
sonnel who respond to emergencies; de-
livery workers. And every time I go to 
the grocery store—and I hope all of you 
do it—I thank those people who are 
stocking the shelves. I thank those 
people who are checking us out. I 
thank those people who are putting the 
carts where they need to be. They are 
the best of America, and we owe it to 
them to do all we can to bring this pan-
demic to an end as quickly and safely 
as possible. We all want to go back to 
work in the regular fashion. The Demo-
cratic-led House will continue to do ev-
erything possible, working with our 
Republican friends, who we believe 
want the same objective, a safe Amer-
ica, a working America. 
We want to help small businesses, 
workers, and their families get through 
this crisis, and to ensure that our cou-
rageous healthcare workers who are on 
the front lines have all the support 
necessary to win this fight against 
COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I hope, and I pray 
that every Member of Congress will 
vote for America and Americans, and 
vote for this bill. We may need more, 
but we certainly need to do this this 
day and get more assistance to the 
American people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BRADY) controls the time. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself 30 seconds. Let me fact-check 
the absurd claim that Congress has left 
State and local governments behind. 
We fund one-third of State budgets 
year-to-year. We have already given 
$150 billion direct aid to State and 
local governments. Some Democrat 
governors haven’t even sent it down to 
their local communities. 
$260 billion in State unemployment; 
$100 billion for State and local hos-
pitals in healthcare; $45 billion for 
State and local disaster aid; $30 billion 
for State and local schools and col-
leges; $25 billion for State and local 
mass 
transit; 
and 
more 
Medicaid 
money for our State and local govern-
ments. That claim is simply absurd. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Idaho 
(Mr. 
FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, a 
month ago we stood on the floor and 
we authorized a $2.2 trillion stimulus 
package. Today, we will authorize an-
other $480 billion to keep it going. By 
law, the U.S. economy is mostly shut 
down. As long as that is the case, we 
have an obligation to facilitate relief. 
So with anxiety, I will support an ex-
tension of the Paycheck Protection 
Program. 
Madam Speaker, most of the Mem-
bers have not been here the last month. 
We have been working, but we have 
been working from home due to health 
concerns. And by most of Congress not 
being here, that means only a few ne-
gotiate the deals, and these are very 
big deals. 
Madam Speaker, our job is here. No 
more bypassing of regular order. This 
virus may threaten our health, but 
when all of us aren’t involved in the 
work of Congress, our Republic is 
threatened. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, the gen-
tleman has already said that he in-
tends to visit the issue immediately of 
more aid for State and local govern-
ments, and be assured, based upon the 
negotiations and discussions we have 
had in our caucus, that opportunity 
will present itself in the near future. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, 
families are in crisis, food pantry lines 
around the block, rent is due again in 
8 days. The community health centers 
and hospital workers in my district are 
desperate. This is a crisis within a cri-
sis, exacerbating every inequity that 
already existed. This Chamber will de-
termine how many more lives we are 
robbed of. Now is not the time for a 
back-pass. 
Our Nation is crying out. The people 
are crying out, and we must answer 
their cries in the CARES package with 
a bill that puts the people first. Now is 
not the time to rest. We took an oath. 
People are counting on us. They de-
serve healthcare and economic housing 
justice. We cannot continue to leave 
out our immigrant neighbors and mi-
nority-owned small businesses. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of this legislation. This very im-
portant legislation, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, has proven to be a 
great program that has saved many 
small businesses in the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia, and there

are many small businesses that still 
need this program. Therefore, the extra 
funding that we are sending here today 
is going to be utilized and utilized in a 
great way by these small businesses. 
Also, there are $75 billion in there for 
hospitals, and hospitals—particularly 
rural hospitals—are extremely impor-
tant in this scenario as well. We need 
to make sure that money gets to them. 
Oh, by the way, speaking of hos-
pitals, Madam Speaker, heroes come 
and go but legends last forever. We 
have heard that before. Today, our he-
roes are wearing white lab coats. They 
are our doctors, our pharmacists, our 
healthcare workers, our nurses, who 
are providing healthcare services, risk-
ing their own health in order to pro-
vide these healthcare services to our 
citizens. I thank them for that. Our 
country thanks them for that. Their 
service will be legendary. 
And finally, Madam Speaker, for all 
of those in the First Congressional Dis-
trict and throughout our country who 
have lost loved ones, our thoughts and 
prayers are with you. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ). 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, on behalf of my constituents 
in the Bronx and Queens, New York’s 
14th Congressional District, the most 
impacted district in America, calling 
people losing their families every day, 
it is a joke when Republicans say that 
they have urgency around this bill. 
The only folks that they have ur-
gency around are folks like Ruth’s 
Chris Steak House and Shake Shack. 
Those are the people getting assistance 
in this bill. You are not trying to fix 
this bill for moms and pops. And we 
have to fight to fund hospitals, fight to 
fund testing. That is what we are fight-
ing for in this bill. It is unconscion-
able. If you had urgency, you would 
legislate like rent was due on May 1st 
and make sure that you include rent 
and mortgage relief for our constitu-
ents. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. BILIRAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the ranking member yield-
ing me the time. 
Madam Speaker, since the establish-
ment of the PPP, I have heard from 
countless local, small businesses that 
the application process was difficult to 
navigate. In response to these revela-
tions, I submitted to leadership a letter 
asking that any future funding for PPP 
loans contain a set-aside for the truly 
small businesses, like the mom and 
pops. 
I was pleased to see this take its 
form in today’s funding package that 
sets aside funds for small community 
banks and credit unions, which have a 
good track record working with our 
small businesses. 
Madam Speaker, it would be a trag-
edy if we lost these mom-and-pop busi-
nesses. I have a business in my district. 
It is Faklis’ Department Store and 
Shoe Repair. They have been around 
since 1912, Madam Speaker. I don’t 
want to see them go. The store was es-
tablished by Greek immigrants and 
passed on from generation to genera-
tion. It would be a great tragedy if we 
lost them. They survived World War II, 
of course, World War I, and the Great 
Depression. Let’s save our small busi-
nesses. They are the backbone of Amer-
ica. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. UNDERWOOD). 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Paycheck 
Protection Program and Health Care 
Enhancement Act. This urgently need-
ed legislation will help provide almost 
$700 billion in additional grants and 
loans to small businesses and farmers 
reeling from the coronavirus crisis. It 
invests $75 billion in providers, $25 bil-
lion in testing, and requires the admin-
istration to develop a national plan for 
testing, so once our businesses reopen, 
they can stay open. 
Congress has more to do. Frontline 
workers need PPE. Families and com-
munities need relief. But this bill is a 
necessary interim fix to keep needed- 
funds flowing to small businesses and 
our health system. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. LAMB). 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, a Sen-
ator said yesterday he would let local 
governments go bankrupt. And while 
he said that, our local county execu-
tive was busy loading food into people’s 
cars. Cars that had toolboxes and work 
boots in them, and people who were 
nonetheless hungry. 
If the Senator has his way, it is these 
people whose towns will go bankrupt. 
He talks about the economy. And I 
asked, ‘‘What happens to an economy 
where entire towns of firefighters and 
teachers and others lose their pay-
check or their pension?’’ 
We are moving the ball today, but no 
one should mistake this for a touch-
down. The Senator would send our best 
players off the field. The American 
people will never accept that, and nei-
ther should we. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this legis-
lation. As a small business person, I am 
glad that it helps small businesses. As 
the husband of a physician who is 
treating COVID patients today, I am 
glad that it helps hospitals. But as an 
American, I am glad that we are com-
ing together to help those whose lives 
are falling apart. We must do more, but 
let’s come back together again and re-
solve to do this in a bipartisan fashion 
once again. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam 
Speaker, South Florida is hurting. My 
community is calling me in tears be-
cause they don’t know how they are 
going to make payments or keep their 
businesses afloat, and hospital workers 
are afraid of losing their jobs. And to 
make matters worse, Floridians—over 
1 million Floridians—still cannot ac-
cess unemployment benefits. 
Although I am happy to support this 
legislation to support our small busi-
nesses, we need to make sure that it is 
those small mom-and-pop businesses, 
minority-owned 
businesses, 
women- 
owned businesses, veteran-owned busi-
nesses, that receive that funding. We 
have not done enough for America. We 
need to continue to work. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ROSE). 
b 1445 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today because I agree 
with my colleagues across the aisle. We 
should have been here weeks ago: 
weeks ago to get more money for our 
hospitals, weeks ago to protect testing, 
weeks ago to improve this program for 
small businesses. 
But, alas, only in Washington, D.C., 
would we wait weeks when we all 
agree. But let’s move forward because 
our frontline workers right now cannot 
afford for us to stand by for politics. 
Leader MCCONNELL said to our cities 
and States, to our cops and firemen 
and teachers, he told them to drop 
dead. Well, why don’t we put politics 
aside, rise up, and tell him that we put 
the country first. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
am going to vote for this bill because it 
provides desperately needed money for 
small businesses and hospitals. But we 
have got to do better by our State and 
local governments. We must support 
the work of our cops, firefighters, 
EMTs, and teachers. 
New Jersey is critical in the fight 
against this virus. We have more sci-
entists and engineers per square mile 
than anywhere in the world and the 
best education system in the country,

so supporting our State and local gov-
ernments in New Jersey is key to beat-
ing this virus and taking care of Amer-
icans. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN). 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
support this legislation as a critical 
lifeline to small businesses coping with 
the crisis and the hospitals on the 
front lines of this war. 
SBA loan programs are vital to Main 
Street businesses across my district, 
and I am proud to support them. But 
this must-pass bill should also include 
support for America’s smallest and me-
dium-sized communities who face the 
very real possibility of eliminating 
basic services without our support. 
The same police and fire, health de-
partment and sanitation workers who 
are risking their lives every day now 
have their jobs at risk. They deserve 
better. We should give them better. 
Let’s do it. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, shame 
on those who would not tell the truth 
during a pandemic. Though more help 
is needed, I rise in support of this in-
terim funding bill. 
These dollars must actually make it 
to those who need it: small family busi-
nesses, minority- and women-owned 
businesses, so many I have talked to 
over these last few weeks. Their future 
and our economy depends upon it. 
For healthcare workers saving lives, 
we have the responsibility to do all we 
can to help protect those who are sav-
ing our families’ lives. 
To reopen our country, we need test-
ing, testing, testing. I look forward to 
the next more robust and even more 
equitable bill of relief for the people. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES). 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the aid that 
we will deliver today. 
My small State of Connecticut will 
soon pass 2,000 fatalities. These are our 
neighbors. These are people we know 
and love. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the bi-
partisanship that will be demonstrated 
today. It will save lives. 
Our small businesses are critical to 
our economy and to opportunity, but 
so are our hospitals and the heroes who 
work in those hospitals. So are our 
EMTs and our paramedics and our po-
lice officers and our firefighters. I say 
that not to make a political point, but 
to say that they will need our help in 
the coming days, and we need to tease 
out more bipartisanship to get that 
done quickly. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. ROUDA). 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this legislation. 
But let’s be clear: 50,000 of our fellow 
Americans have already died. We have 
26 million Americans out of work. We 
have tens of thousands of small busi-
nesses that will not be able to partici-
pate in this legislation because we 
haven’t funded it enough, and we have 
cities clearly looking at the prospect of 
bankruptcy. 
So we do have a lot more work to do, 
and I hope we can continue to work in 
a bipartisan fashion, stop the partisan 
sniping, and do what we were meant to 
do here to protect our country. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, healthcare workers 
and small businesses are struggling to 
stay alive. That is why Democrats 
fought to ensure hospitals and Main 
Street get this jolt of relief. 
We walled off billions in new Pay-
check Protection Program funds for 
smaller community banks and credit 
unions so Wall Street doesn’t vacuum 
it all up. 
Let’s face it: If healthcare workers 
cannot safely protect us, America’s 
economy stops. So Democrats secured 
$75 billion for healthcare providers and 
$25 billion more for testing. Without 
mass testing, we can not fully reopen, 
and we end up voting for endless relief 
packages. 
Without Democrats’ push for truly 
small businesses, big business would 
have continued to cut the line. 
We will rescue schools and local gov-
ernments in CARES Act 2. Right now, 
this is the adrenaline shot that the 
healthcare system needs. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN). 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, we 
need to shift from the economic to the 
biological focus on defeating this dis-
ease. 
Everyone should wear a mask, in-
cluding you, Mr. President, whenever 
you might be within 6 feet. 
And we need to provide free masks to 
the homeless and others. 
We need more money for better paid 
sick leave so all those with symptoms 
can stay home. 
And so far, only one-tenth of 1 per-
cent of the coronavirus money has 
gone for medical research to prevent 
and treat the virus. 
Now, I am pleased this bill has 
money for testing and to develop new 
tests. The next bill needs $5 billion to 
research therapeutics. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. TORRES). 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this bill 
and to highlight the need for reliable 
testing. 
Last week, Pastor Joseph Owes suc-
cumbed to COVID–19. He was a pillar in 
our community, hosted food banks, 
health fairs, job and financial literacy 
workshops to help his community. 
He tried repeatedly to get tested but 
was denied time and time again be-
cause testing hasn’t been available in 
my community. If he had been tested 
and treated earlier, he would still be 
here with us today. 
Without tests, we don’t know who 
has COVID and we can’t open up our 
economy. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, people 
in my State of Minnesota are hurting, 
and I am sure everyone represents a 
State that is hurting. 
It is indefensible for us not to sup-
port to replenish the PPP, but it is also 
indefensible for us not to focus on re-
plenishing the coffers of Americans and 
focus on making sure they are able to 
support paying their rent, making sure 
that our cities and States are not going 
bankrupt, and making sure American 
families are not dying of hunger. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. TORRES SMALL). 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to get Ameri-
cans the support to keep them safe and 
make sure New Mexicans and rural 
communities get their fair share. By 
refilling 
small 
business 
forgivable 
loans and dedicating money to small 
lenders, this package will help New 
Mexicans who were crowded out of the 
first wave of funding. 
I am also voting to save rural hos-
pitals and to get testing and masks and 
gloves and gowns, all the things we 
need to keep us safe and to rebuild our 
economy. 
There is still so much work to be 
done, and let’s do that next step to-
gether. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, might I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing on both sides.

from Texas has 4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, in 
the Northwest Bronx, in Washington 
Heights, Inwood, in Harlem and East 
Harlem, this pandemic is still ravaging 
Black and Brown lives. The economic 
plight this virus will leave will be un-
precedented. 
I am glad we are providing $60 billion 
for small businesses and fought for 
funding for hospitals and testing, but 
we must come back. 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s words are equiv-
alent to Gerald Ford’s words: Drop 
dead, New York. 
But we will come back. 
We must support State and local gov-
ernments. We must support our com-
munities. Our people are dying. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CARBAJAL). 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this bipartisan relief 
package. The funds we are adding to 
the PPP and EIDL programs will go a 
long way in providing necessary sup-
port to small businesses. I am glad that 
small farms and ranches will now be el-
igible for the EIDL program and that 
we have secured additional resources 
for hospitals, workers, and testing. 
While this is another great bipartisan 
step forward, more must be done, espe-
cially for our States, cities, and local 
governments. People are hurting. Time 
is of the essence. We must act now. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, this bill 
is only necessary because, in the last 
bill, Republicans prioritized a half-tril-
lion-dollar gift to corporations that 
turned around and laid off workers who 
bailed them out. 
Our people need us to prioritize pub-
lic health and testing, and they need 
recurring 
monthly 
relief 
payments 
now. 
This is Skylar Herbert. You need to 
see her face because there needs to be 
a human face to this pandemic. She is 
5 years old, died from coronavirus. 
Skylar loved dressing up and per-
forming, and she loved and adored 
being 
in 
kindergarten. 
Her 
death 
should be a wake-up call that we must 
act in urgency. 
Her father, a firefighter, her mother 
a police officer, first responders, and 
the amount of guilt that they feel be-
cause maybe they didn’t have access to 
testing, that is exactly why they are 
out there telling her story every single 
day. 
Please, let’s act now in urgency. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Michigan an ad-
ditional 1 minute. 
Ms. TLAIB. I urge my colleagues to 
please do more to save lives. It is im-
moral for us to walk away and take a 
month off when people, our neighbors, 
are dying and losing loved ones. 
So, in memory of Skylar, in honor of 
her, please let’s expand public health 
funding and testing for everyone. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COX). 
Mr. 
COX 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I hear my colleagues on the 
other side today, one after another, 
crying about the replenishment of the 
PPP. They wanted to keep it as origi-
nally designed, where 4 percent of the 
borrowers got 45 percent of the money. 
I think the farms and dairies and small 
mom-and-pop shops in my district and 
across the country should get loans be-
fore big steakhouses. 
I am proud of the work my Caucus 
has done to make the PPP a more equi-
table program, plus getting sorely 
needed funds for hospitals and testing, 
which we all know is what is required 
to reopen our economy. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1500 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume as 
I prepare to close. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
many Members and staff who made 
sure this final product conveyed the 
values of the Democratic Caucus and 
will bring real life and relief to the 
American people. 
First, I want to thank the Speaker, 
who has provided tremendous leader-
ship to get this deal over the line. 
Next, our deepest gratitude to fellow 
committee chairs and their contribu-
tions and shrewd negotiation of this 
package. 
Small Business Committee Chair-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ and Financial Serv-
ices Committee Chairwoman WATERS 
deserve our thanks for securing fund-
ing for small businesses that will need 
it the most. 
Thanks to FRANK PALLONE from the 
Energy and Commerce Committee for 
fighting for national testing as a strat-
egy and securing funding to combat 
this public health crisis. 
Each coronavirus relief package has 
been a herculean effort, and this one is 
no different. 
With that, I want to close and wish 
good health to our colleagues and our 
fellow Americans, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. I 
am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man NEAL for his leadership and close 
working relationship on these key 
issues. 
Look, this bill is 16 days too late, de-
spite all of the denials you heard. We 
could have agreed on this bill in 16 
minutes, Republicans and Democrats, 
but it got held up for all sorts of extra-
curricular stuff. We should have come 
together. It was delayed. Real people 
lost their jobs as a result. 
Secondly, I want to thank President 
Trump, Vice President PENCE, the en-
tire Cabinet, and everyone in the gov-
ernment who has done a remarkable 
job standing up the small business pro-
gram in 7 days, in sending out indi-
vidual rebate checks in 18 days rather 
than 70 months that it took the last 
time there were rebate checks. I want 
to 
thank 
that 
leadership 
in 
this 
coronavirus 
crisis, 
both 
on 
the 
healthcare side and with the economic 
challenges we face. 
I want to thank Minority Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, who has done a re-
markable job leading the Republicans 
in the House through each of these key 
emergency aid bills. I want to thank 
the leadership that supports him, rank-
ing members who work with our Demo-
cratic colleagues to put together a bill 
we think is critical and urgent. 
There is a guiding quote that I have 
kept as my computer screen saver for 
many years here in my office. It reads: 
‘‘I cannot give you the formula for suc-
cess, but I can give you the formula for 
failure, which is: Try to please every-
body.’’ 
This bill doesn’t try to please every-
body or do everything. It focuses on re-
plenishing small business loan pro-
grams that local businesses and their 
workers desperately need. It provides 
more funding for our hospitals and 
healthcare workers who man the front 
lines of this pandemic. It commits 
more of your tax dollars producing and 
distributing tests to communities that 
need them. These are immediate, ur-
gent priorities right now, and we need 
to act right now. 
I would point out, also, Mr. Speaker, 
that those who say we are not com-
mitted to State and local communities, 
this 
Congress, 
Republicans 
joined 
Democrats, sending $150 billion down 
to our State and local communities. 
Unlike some Democratic Governors 
who are holding their dollars at the 
State capitol and refuse to share it 
with local communities, our Governor 
in Texas announced more than a week 
ago he was developing an approach to 
make sure all of our communities on 
the front line are getting help. Gov-
ernors who are withholding that aid to 
small 
communities 
ought 
to 
be 
ashamed of themselves. 
Finally, let’s continue, after this 
work is done today, to work together 
with President Trump to apply max-
imum pressure to the coronavirus, help 
businesses create safe, healthy work-
places. Let’s jump-start the economic 
rebound and accelerate a return to

work for those who are jobless or fur-
loughed. 
I urge strong and bipartisan support 
for this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to establish 
clarity in the RECORD. 
This legislation is much improved 
over what came over to us from the 
Senate. This includes an additional $75 
billion for our hospitals, $60 billion 
that is directed at people at the bottom 
end of the small business community. 
In addition, we all agree in this 
Chamber that the following has to 
occur: testing, testing, testing. That 
was not in the legislation until we de-
cided on this side to establish that as a 
marker. This legislation, on every 
basis, has been improved. 
And let me just say this: President 
Trump has said more money for State 
and 
local 
governments, 
Republican 
Governors across the country and 
Democratic Governors, including the 
Republican Governor of Massachusetts 
who has spoken to me personally on 
this issue, as we go forward. 
This is about the police, the fire, the 
EMTs. 
This 
is 
about 
the 
school-
teachers. This is about those individ-
uals who make a difference in our lives, 
the postal workers every day, and not 
to forget those individuals whom we 
depend on and we have come to see just 
how important they are to all of us in 
the last few weeks. That is what the 
additional phase four will look like. 
And with that, Mr. Speaker, with 
gratitude, I want to recognize the gen-
tlewoman from New York. I must tell 
you that not only did she do a great job 
with authoring this legislation, but her 
patience in answering questions from 
colleagues during the course of the last 
2 weeks has been remarkable. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of 
my time to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, by 
providing $310 billion for PPP, this bill 
will allow the program to reopen and 
more small businesses to secure capital 
and keep employees on payroll—$310 
billion. 
When the Senate passed their bill, 
they passed $250 billion for small busi-
nesses. So it is not enough to pour 
funding into a program if loans are not 
reaching the intended businesses. All of 
us have been concerned by reports of 
big banks prioritizing large firms for 
this assistance. 
Over 80 publicly traded companies 
have received loans through the PPP. 
Examples like this come to mind: 
Ruth’s Chris Steak House restaurant 
got two loans for $20 million. And we 
have all this, 80 publicly traded compa-
nies. This underscores the need for 
oversight. 
If the administration’s implementa-
tion means giant companies secure 
loans while small businesses are left 
waiting, that problem must be cor-
rected promptly. That is not what Con-
gress intended, and the American peo-
ple expect better. 
By the way, today, this morning, as 
the chair of the House Small Business 
Committee, I held a hearing entitled, 
Member Day Hearing on COVID–19 Re-
sponse and Recovery. Fifty-six Mem-
bers of this Chamber, Republicans and 
Democrats, all of them, came before 
the committee today, and every one, 
Republican and Democrat, expressed 
the fact that we needed more trans-
parency, that we needed data, and that 
we needed to fight to make sure that 
this program serves every small busi-
ness in every part of the country. 
That is why my colleagues and I 
fought in this package to secure $60 bil-
lion in PPP funds set aside specifically 
for mission-based, community-oriented 
lenders. With this set-aside, more un-
derserved small businesses will get 
loans. 
In addition, this bill provides $60 bil-
lion for the Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan program, the EIDL program. 
Again, when they sent the bill from the 
Senate to the House, it didn’t have any 
money for the EIDL program, for the 
disaster loan program. 
Everyone who testified today before 
my committee was asking how we are 
going to make sure that their busi-
nesses, their constituents, will get dis-
aster loans. Well, we have good news 
for them. The Democrats fought and 
secured not only $50 billion, but $10 bil-
lion in grants. 
And I heard complaints about the 
fact that the grants program ran out of 
money and that people really like that 
program, the grants program. Well, I 
wanted $100 billion; we secured $10 bil-
lion. Again, we are putting in $10 bil-
lion in this bill that was not part of 
what Senator MITCH MCCONNELL sent 
to us. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI, Minority 
Leader 
SCHUMER, 
and 
Chairwoman 
WATERS for their efforts to include all 
these provisions, particularly the $60 
billion carved out for minority busi-
nesses, for women-owned businesses, 
for veterans’ businesses, for farmers to 
have a chance to secure a loan. 
While this legislation is a building 
block, more must be done. In future 
legislation, we must help businesses 
shuttered for longer than 8 weeks. 
This bill also does not address prob-
lems that let big companies snatch up 
loans meant for small businesses. To 
those large publicly traded companies 
who have already benefitted, I would 
suggest now would be a time to exhibit 
some good corporate citizenship by re-
turning those funds. 
To the small businesses out there 
who have not yet received help, whom 
my office hears from daily, I say this: 
We are not finished. 
Getting these programs restarted and 
loans out the door is critical. Because 
of the improvements that we made to 
this bill, I will say that help is on the 
way and that we will hold the agencies 
accountable, that we must adhere to 
transparency, and that we must pro-
vide the data that we need in order to 
assess if this program is working as it 
was intended. 
As chair of the Small Business Com-
mittee, I will fight tooth and nail for 
small businesses that have not yet re-
ceived any assistance. 
Mr. Speaker, let me remind the Sen-
ate majority leader that there are two 
Chambers. You can be sure that in this 
Chamber, I will be fighting nonstop for 
hard-hit States like New York. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I will be supporting this bipartisan relief bill. 
It will give small businesses access to addi-
tional funds that will help them keep their 
doors open. 
And, it will also assist hospitals over-
whelmed by this virus, get health care workers 
the protective gear they need, and help ex-
pand rapid testing nationwide. 
While this bill will do a lot of good, it still 
does not go far enough for my state of Texas 
and people across America. 
Texas is 49th out of 50 states for testing per 
capita, and in large cities like Houston nearly 
60 percent of COVID–19 related deaths were 
of African Americans and nearly 20 percent 
Latino. 
We need to do more to help community 
health clinics helping poor people, expand mo-
bile testing sites in hard hit communities, and 
deploy rapid testing nationwide now. 
And we also need to ensure that we are 
getting more direct aid into the hands of folks 
across America. 
This is critical as we work to responsibly 
open our country. 
We must put working families first and I 
urge my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle to join us in getting this done in the next 
package. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 266, the Paycheck Protection 
Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. 
This interim legislation is critical to support our 
small businesses and healthcare systems, but 
we must do much more to support families, 
communities, and our economy. 
In the wake of the unprecedented COVID– 
19 pandemic, Congress acted swiftly to pro-
vide funding for hospitals and healthcare facili-
ties, schools, states and localities, and small 
businesses. Unfortunately, the funding was not 
sufficient to meet the need and too many 
small businesses are left wondering if they 
can survive. I have heard from small business 
owners from across Northwest Oregon who 
were unable to access the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program and Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan and Grant funding. They described their 
frustration as the money was quickly ex-
hausted; a significant amount going to large 
restaurant chains while small mom and pop 
businesses were left out. The pandemic con-
tinues to ravage communities and our econ-
omy remains largely shut down through no 
fault of the small business owners and work-
ers who need our help in this unprecedented 
time. The bill before us today will provide the 
assistance those businesses need. The bill in-
cludes $310 billion in additional funding for the 
Paycheck Protection Program, with $60 billion 
of that funding dedicated for lending by com-
munity-based and small- and mid-sized lend-
ers, including credit unions, community banks,

and other institutions that are prepared to lend 
to that small businesses that have traditionally 
been overlooked, such as minority-owned 
businesses, businesses owned by women and 
veterans, and small businesses in our rural 
communities. We must make sure this money 
gets to mom and pop businesses. 
The bill also bolsters the Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan and Grant programs by pro-
viding $60 billion in funding, and expanding 
the program so farmers and many agricultural 
enterprises are eligible. The programs provide 
funding for small businesses to cover oper-
ating expenses, but were similarly under-
funded for the demand. 
H.R. 266 also provides $75 billion in much- 
needed 
funding 
for 
our 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare facilities. We know that these facili-
ties are operating without the resources they 
need, and are unable to cover expenses be-
cause they can’t perform elective procedures 
during stay home orders. The bill also includes 
$25 billion to expand testing, including funding 
for states and localities, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control, the National Institutes of Health, 
the Biomedical Advanced Research and De-
velopment Authority, and the Food and Drug 
Administration. We need to vastly expand test-
ing capabilities if we are going to be able to 
get a handle on this pandemic, so I am thank-
ful that this funding was included. 
The funding included in this bill is critical to 
help our country, but we must do so much 
more to support workers, small businesses, 
and communities. Our work is far from done. 
I am continuing to fight for robust child care 
support, increased funding and capabilities for 
the Low Income Home Energy Assistance 
Program, funding for workers and our work-
force system through the Workforce Innovation 
and Opportunity Act, and expanded access to 
capital through our credit unions to make it 
easier for them to lend to small businesses. I 
am also fighting to make sure that our state 
and local governments receive more funding, 
students and teachers have the resources 
they need, that people receive additional eco-
nomic impact payments, and that our immi-
grant community is included in future relief ef-
forts. I’m also advocating for workplace protec-
tion standards and essential pay for frontline 
workers during this pandemic. I am extremely 
disappointed that this bill doesn’t recognize 
the increased number of people who are now 
food insecure and lack additional SNAP bene-
fits that individuals and families desperately 
need. As we move forward, I will continue to 
fight for robust legislation to help individuals, 
families, and our communities and small busi-
nesses around the country. 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I support this im-
perfect interim agreement. But I want to be 
clear, while it funds some key priorities, it 
leaves behind additional key assistance that 
we can provide to households, individuals, and 
state and local governments that are the tip of 
the spear in the fight against COVID–19. As 
we take up this bill, I recognize that it is a 
much better bill than the one Senate Majority 
Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL
tried to ram 
through the Senate last week. Thanks to those 
who worked so hard to help accomplish that. 
That being said, it is clear that this Con-
gress has much more work to do to support 
the American people, our heroic public health 
and health professionals on the front line of 
this pandemic while fighting to get basic pro-
tective equipment, and to help support state, 
local, and tribal governments that are leading 
this response. 
This legislation will temporarily refill the Pay-
check Protection Program but if the experi-
ence of the first week of this program is any 
indication, demand will again quickly over-
whelm this program and the program’s funds 
will be quickly depleted. And while I support 
the changes to direct funds into the hands of 
some of the most vulnerable small busi-
nesses, that addresses just one of the numer-
ous concerns about this program that my of-
fice has heard. And I know other Members 
have heard as well. More changes are needed 
not only to increase transparency and protect 
the taxpayer, but also to help this program 
work better for more vulnerable small busi-
nesses, not just larger corporations or friends 
of the Trump Administration. 
I am also pleased that the bill includes addi-
tional funding to support our hospitals and 
other health providers that daily work to test, 
diagnose, treat those affected with this illness. 
They have saved countless lives. However, so 
far, the Administration has only released $30 
billion of the first $100 billion provided by Con-
gress a few weeks ago, with little if any of that 
money shipped out so far going to children’s 
hospitals, community health centers or Med-
icaid providers, among others who are strug-
gling. 
The Administration needs to be more trans-
parent about how it will distribute the remain-
ing funds from the first round and the addi-
tional funding in this bill and how it will deter-
mine key terms, such as hot spots that it re-
portedly wants to target. And it needs to get 
these dollars out soon. Weeks more of delay 
is not acceptable. 
Additional funding provided for our public 
health efforts through CDC, HRSA, and NIH is 
appreciated. But since this is a public health 
emergency, much more funding is needed es-
pecially as state and local governments are 
challenged by an economic slowdown that has 
imperiled their revenues. 
There is more to be done and that must be 
done soon. We need another strong com-
prehensive bill in line with the CARES act that 
responds to emerging needs. Access to Per-
sonal Protective Equipment remains a struggle 
and testing remains a challenge even while 
the Administration pats itself on the back on 
both fronts. 
Additionally, we need to ensure that critical 
programs that serve populations that will be hit 
the hardest by any economic downturn, like 
TANF and SNAP, are granted funding and 
flexibility to help people through these trying 
times. Having tried to take care of everybody 
else, our next package needs to look out for 
the least, the last, and the lost. 
Lastly, one of the truly missed opportunities 
is funding to support safe and secure elections 
in this environment. Unfortunately, my state of 
Wisconsin has become an unwelcomed exam-
ple of what happens when partisanship, rather 
than people’s well-being, guides decisions 
about holding elections in this environment. In 
the city of Milwaukee, the largest city in the 
State, there were only 5 polling stations avail-
able. You can guess the result . . . long lines 
that both discouraged voting and raised a po-
tential health threat to both voters and poll 
workers. 
We know more elections will be held soon 
and regardless of decisions about reopening 
states and cities, they must take place in the 
safest and securest possible environment we 
can ensure. That requires funding. Funding to 
support a full panoply of voting options includ-
ing absentee ballots and extended early voting 
periods. We also need funding to ensure local-
ities have an adequate number of polling 
places and funds to ensure that all votes cast 
are counted accurately and fairly. And that’s 
just to list a few of the reasons why funding 
to protect our election security is so fun-
damentally needed. In the recent Wisconsin 
election, nearly 80% of the ballots cast were 
absentee. But even there you had issues as 
you had people request a ballot who did not 
get one or had one sent after the elections, 
there were also issues with stacks of undeliv-
ered absentee ballots, and ballots returned be-
cause they did not have a postmark. The 
longer we delay providing these funds, the 
less likely we will get, despite the best efforts 
by hardworking state and local officials, a fair 
election. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the interim emergency corona virus 
package being considered today. 
The last two months have been some of the 
hardest in our nation’s history. The toll that 
this virus has taken on our economy and, 
more importantly, on American lives, has been 
staggering. Over the last few weeks, my office 
has received thousands of calls and emails 
from constituents who need help obtaining the 
important economic relief provisions secured 
by Congress. 
While some small businesses and nonprofits 
in my district were able to access programs 
like the Paycheck Protection Program, many 
more were shut out from these critical funds. 
Let’s be clear—large companies and cor-
porations never should have been allowed to 
receive funds meant for small businesses. 
Now, it’s up to us to begin to make this right 
and ensure that those small businesses most 
in need get access to replenished relief funds. 
Countless American jobs—and lives—are on 
the line. 
The legislation before us today would pro-
vide an additional $310 billion in funding for 
the Paycheck Protection Program, including 
billions intended for businesses in under-
served rural, urban and tribal communities. It 
also provides $50 billion for additional emer-
gency disaster lending, translating into more 
than $350 billion in loans, and another $10 bil-
lion in emergency disaster grants. 
In addition, this package continues our ef-
forts to provide health care workers with the 
life-saving protective equipment they need to 
do their jobs safely and effectively by directing 
$75 billion toward hospitals and other health 
care providers. 
Also of great importance to me is the $25 
billion this package secures for testing, which 
is key to quickly and safely reopening the 
country. These funds will be critical in facili-
tating the large-scale production and rapid de-
ployment of precise coronavirus testing— 
which public health experts agree is necessary 
to determine when people can get out of their 
homes and back into schools, the workforce 
and society. 
Despite these important provisions, this 
package falls short in a number of areas. 
For one, it is unacceptable that Republicans 
blocked more funding for state and local gov-
ernments on the frontlines of this crisis. Right 
now, every American is benefiting from the

tireless work our local officials are doing to 
keep us safe. 
However, without additional support from 
the federal government, the costs of the 
coronavirus response—on top of the reduced 
tax revenues caused by the economic fallout 
of the pandemic—threaten to bankrupt our 
communities and undermine public health ef-
forts. 
The fact that some in Congress and the Ad-
ministration would rather bail out big corpora-
tions than support the local governments 
working day and night to keep us safe is un-
acceptable. We will not stop fighting until our 
communities get the support they need. 
We also must continue fighting for the most 
vulnerable among us. Our immigrant commu-
nities, incarcerated individuals, undocumented 
people, poor families and many others are still 
being left out of important relief provisions. 
If there’s one thing we’ve learned through-
out this pandemic, it’s that we’re all in this to-
gether. We have to look out for each other, 
and we have to do our part to take care of 
one another. 
While I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether to pass today’s package to bring addi-
tional relief to our small businesses and health 
care providers, we must continue working to 
ensure all those suffering from this pandemic 
can be made whole. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of the Paycheck Protection and Health Care 
Enhancement Act. This emergency funding is 
the fourth bipartisan aid package to address 
the tremendous needs of the American people 
as we fight COVID–19 on both the public 
health front and the economic front. 
The Democratic House has led the way to 
respond to this emergency. On March 4th, 
when the Administration refused to acknowl-
edge the magnitude of this crisis, the House 
passed bipartisan emergency legislation pro-
viding four times the amount of funding for 
public health purposes than the Trump Admin-
istration originally requested. A week later, the 
House passed the bipartisan Families First 
Act, which recognized the importance of free 
coronavirus testing and the need for paid sick 
leave and nutrition aid for working families. On 
March 27th the House passed the bipartisan 
CARES Act putting families and workers first, 
instead of a corporate, trickle-down approach 
offered by the Senate. 
Today, the bipartisan Paycheck Protection 
and Health Care Enhancement Act continues 
the House’s work to respond to the pandemic. 
It flips an insufficient Republican proposal that 
left hospitals, Community Health Centers, and 
health care workers behind by nearly doubling 
the resources to provide badly needed assist-
ance to them. 
The legislation contains the following: 
Small businesses: Adds $310 billion to re-
plenish the Paycheck Protection Programs, re-
serving $60 billion of that funding for commu-
nity-based lenders, credit unions and small to 
midsized community banks that work with the 
smallest of businesses. The bill also adds an 
additional $50 billion in disaster loans at the 
SBA and $10 billion in grants to small busi-
nesses and nonprofits. 
$75 billion for hospitals, health systems, 
Community Health Centers, and other health 
care providers, including funds for Personal 
Protective Equipment for frontline workers. 
For all Americans: $25 billion for testing, the 
key to reopening the economy. Today, ap-
proximately one percent of Americans have 
been tested. This legislation calls for a na-
tional strategic testing policy focused on in-
creasing domestic testing capacity, including 
testing supplies. 
This interim funding package will assist 
workers, families, small businesses, hospitals, 
and all our health care workers. The American 
people have tremendous needs and I’m proud 
to support this legislation to help meet them. 
There’s so much more to do and I stand ready 
to work to meet our historic challenges. I sup-
port this legislation and will continue to sup-
port swift action by a Congress that aids a sci-
entific public health response to the pandemic 
and a worker-first response to the economic 
crisis. 
Finally, I’d like to take a moment to ac-
knowledge the sorrow being felt across the 
country as families mourn the loss of their 
loved ones to this terrible disease. In tribute to 
them, we do our work today. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program and Health Care Enhancement 
Act. 
Our nation’s health and economic recovery 
are inextricably linked during this pandemic. 
Today’s vote is another win in the fight against 
the coronavirus. This legislation strengthens 
the Paycheck Protection Program by allocating 
an additional $310 billion in funding, with 
money reserved for community-based lenders, 
small and medium-sized banks, and credit 
unions to reach more small businesses. It also 
includes vital funding for our hospitals and 
health care workers and money for much 
needed testing. 
While today’s additional funding is a win, 
much more needs to be done. Without addi-
tional measures for testing, tracking, treat-
ment, and ultimately a vaccine, we won’t over-
come this crisis. We must also do more to 
help individuals suffering from the impact on 
the economy, as well as non-profits not cov-
ered under the CARES Act, and state and 
local governments who have been devastated 
by lost revenues and protect essential work-
ers. 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, more 
than two weeks ago, I called for more funding 
for the Paycheck Protection Program, which 
has provided more than 1.6 million loans to 
small businesses across the country. I strongly 
support rapid passage of the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program and Health Care Enhance-
ment Act to support small businesses and our 
nation’s health care professionals. 
With this fourth Coronavirus response pack-
age, we have secured an additional $310 bil-
lion for the Paycheck Protection Program, and 
$60 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans, 
to help more small businesses survive and 
continue to pay their employees. 
In order to reopen our country, more testing 
must be made available so Americans can 
safely return to their normal lives and jobs. 
There is a dedicated $25 billion in this legisla-
tion to prepare and ramp up necessary testing 
to equip state and local decision makers with 
critical information to reopen our communities 
and reignite our economy. Finally, the $75 bil-
lion in additional funds will help hospitals and 
health care workers on the front lines continue 
to take care of those that are battling this ill-
ness. 
It is critical that Congress continue working 
in a bipartisan manner to provide aid, relief, 
and economic security to the nation. With this 
in mind, I oppose passage of a resolution to 
establish a select subcommittee that is dupli-
cative, unnecessary, and most likely a politi-
cally motivated tool to attack the President 
during an election year. Continuing to work 
across the aisle to provide our country the re-
sources it needs is the only way forward. 
I remain grateful to the incredible health 
care professionals, first responders, and es-
sential service employees who are working 
tirelessly to keep our nation healthy. I also sa-
lute Americans who are following guidelines 
and doing their part to flatten the curve for not 
only their own health but for their neighbors. 
The past few weeks have seen our nation 
unite to fight the Coronavirus. While these 
times have been challenging for all, I know 
that we will get through this. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I support the 
bipartisan agreement reached on the Senate 
Amendment to H.R. 266, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program and Health Care Enhance-
ment Act. 
Many California small businesses were un-
able to access the first round of loans made 
through the Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP) established under the CARES Act (H.R. 
748) because the initial round of funds was in-
sufficient to meet the dire needs of our com-
munity during this time. Even more con-
cerning, the Administration’s bungled rollout of 
PPP has sown frustration and confusion at 
every point of the application process, denying 
many Santa Clara County small businesses a 
lifeline. I outlined my concerns regarding these 
flaws in my testimony to the House Small 
Business Committee on Thursday, April 23, 
2020. 
This bill will provide $310 billion in additional 
funding for PPP. More importantly, it will re-
serve $60 billion for small- and medium-sized 
banks, credit unions, and community-based 
lenders to ensure our relief efforts are reach-
ing all communities. It also adds $10 billion to 
Emergency Economic Injury Disaster Grants 
and $50 billion to the Disaster Loans Program 
for our small businesses. 
Our hospitals, health centers, and county 
health officials need the additional $75 billion 
in assistance to maintain necessary resources 
and procure more protective personal equip-
ment for our healthcare workers who continue 
to give and risk so much. 
Additionally, the nation needs the $25 billion 
for testing to guarantee a science-based tran-
sition for when communities are ready to re-
open. A nationwide strategy with a focus on 
increasing domestic testing capacity will be 
critical for reopening the economy and for pre-
venting a second outbreak. 
Four bills and $2 trillion in emergency relief 
later, more is still needed. Specifically, we 
must provide additional direct funding for state 
and local governments and perform robust 
oversight on the allocation of funds for pan-
demic relief to prevent fraud and abuse. State 
and local governments need and deserve fed-
eral assistance. In CARES 2, we must make 
whole the state and local governments on the 
frontlines of this crisis and ensure our state, 
county, and city officials are equipped to pre-
serve the health and safety of our community. 
I will continue to work with my colleagues in 
the House and Senate to address specific 
community needs in any future legislation. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of this economic boost desperately needed by

our communities. Our nation is on a dan-
gerous precipice, an experiment with thou-
sands of lives in the balance. This bill offers 
hope for thousands more small businesses, 
hospitals, and perhaps most importantly those 
on the frontline, with an infusion of $25 billion 
to ramp up desperately needed means to ad-
vance widespread testing. Testing is the key 
that offers containment of this virus. 
I am troubled. Troubled by the little insight 
we have into how the last two trillion dollars 
approved by these hallowed chambers was 
spent by the Trump Administration. We must 
ask why so much has yet to be disbursed. We 
must question why little help was provided to 
those who need it most, while those with ac-
cess had their takings. 
I am proud of the work of my colleagues, 
particularly Small Business Chairwoman NYDIA 
VELA´ZQUEZ, Financial Services Chairwoman 
MAXINE WATERS, and our dedicated Speaker, 
who fought for $60 billion in community lend-
ing and a $310 billion infusion into the Pay-
check Protection Program. This bill provides a 
great step forward and a vital lifeline to small 
businesses across Northern Ohio. 
Unfortunately, this bill drastically short-
changes the localities now forced with over-
whelming burdens, huge losses of revenue, 
huge cuts to budgets, forced decisions of lay-
ing off first-responders or cut back on other 
life-sustaining services. It also offers no assist-
ance to our postal service workers whose jobs 
hang in the balance. 
Calls to reopen without science and data 
are short sighted. Shame on Republican elect-
ed leaders who lead their constituents into the 
fire. What our constituents need is real leader-
ship to keep them safe and supported until a 
bridge to the future for America can safely 
lead to reopening. Lives are at stake. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, in the last few 
weeks, my office has been flooded with calls 
from small business owners desperate for as-
sistance but stymied by the slow response, 
unfair treatment, and limited funds of the small 
business programs set up by the CARES Act. 
I support this legislation because it is abso-
lutely imperative that we recapitalize and im-
prove PPP and EIDL to get small businesses 
the resources and support they need as fairly 
and efficiently as possible. I am also pleased 
this bill provides significant funding for hos-
pitals and expanded testing, without which we 
cannot safely re-open the small businesses 
and other establishments we are trying to 
save. I am, however, all too aware that this in-
fusion of money simply will not be enough to 
meet demand, and many of the problems my 
constituents have raised with PPP and EIDL 
are not addressed by this legislation. 
I am disappointed that, despite the best ef-
forts of my Democratic colleagues, this bill 
does not give state and local governments the 
funding and flexibility they desperately need to 
support their fights against COVID–19 and fill 
the massive revenue gaps they are facing. 
New York State faces a $10 billion loss of tax 
revenue. While we are the epicenter of the 
pandemic, we’re not alone in our budget short-
falls. Oklahoma faces a $415 million gap, Ari-
zona is looking at a $1.1 billion deficit, and 
Maryland could face a $2.2 billion shortfall. My 
Republican colleagues must come to the table 
and support additional resources for states 
and cities and give states additional flexibility 
in how they use the funds, including replacing 
lost revenue. 
That being said, it is absolutely necessary 
that we pass this bill today and provide the 
SBA additional resources to support small 
businesses and ensure they make it through 
this pandemic. Of course there is more we 
need to do. Transit systems need billions in 
resources to stay afloat. Cultural nonprofits 
need funding and flexibility to re-open their 
doors when this pandemic passes. Renters 
desperately need emergency assistance to 
stay in their homes even with the eviction mor-
atorium. The U.S. Postal Service is on the 
brink of collapse. Families need food assist-
ance to keep their kids healthy. Hospitals and 
providers desperately need PPE. Our work is 
not done, and we cannot stop here. But today, 
we must pass this bill and get this small busi-
ness funding flowing again. 
I appreciate the efforts to get this interim bill 
done as quickly as possible, and I look for-
ward to continuing our efforts to stop this pan-
demic, keep our country safe, and, when pub-
lic health experts agree, thoughtfully and care-
fully re-open our economy. 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of our nation’s small businesses. As 
many of my colleagues are aware, our coun-
try’s economy is built upon and benefits from 
the millions of entrepreneurs and innovators 
who go to work every single day for a small 
business. Without these small businesses and 
their employees, the United States would not 
be the economic hub it is today. 
However, Mr. Speaker, these small busi-
nesses, along with our entire nation, have 
been 
presented 
with 
an 
unprecedented 
enemy. The 2019 novel coronavirus has 
wreaked havoc on our health, our economy, 
and our day-to-day lives. Everyday activities 
like visiting our loved ones, dining at our favor-
ite restaurants, or cheering on our favorite 
teams have been placed on hold as we com-
bat this virus. I believe the steps taken by this 
Administration and governors around the 
country, including Governor DeWine in my 
home state, to minimize the destructiveness of 
the coronavirus should be noted and ap-
plauded. 
In Congress, we have worked to provide the 
necessary aid and relief sought by so many. 
We have extended health benefits—placing 
public health at the forefront of our battle. We 
have ramped up our equipment production to 
levels unseen for nearly 80 years, when we 
were fighting the Second World War. And per-
haps most importantly, we have funded aid 
programs within the Small Business Adminis-
tration to lift up America’s small businesses. 
The bill before us, the Paycheck Protection 
Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 
will continue to support these critical efforts 
through much-needed supplemental funding. 
Earlier this week, I introduced my own resolu-
tion to recognize the enormous strain being 
placed upon our economy’s engine, the small 
businesses that are the foundation of all our 
communities. To say that this Congress has 
come to the aid of small businesses would be 
fair; but, to say that our job here is done 
would be far from true. In fact, it is important 
now more than ever to double down on our 
support and ensure unwavering commitment 
to Main Street. 
Mr. Speaker, my resolution specifically re-
quests Congress to increase its support for 
America’s small businesses. I am extremely 
pleased to see that programs such as the 
Paycheck Protection Program and the Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Loan program will re-
ceive the money needed to continue aiding 
our nation’s small businesses. Of the $349 bil-
lion appropriated by Congress in the CARES 
Act for small business relief programs, my 
home state of Ohio received over $14 billion. 
These dollars are going to real businesses 
and helping communities, both large and 
small, across my district. I hope even more 
dollars make their way to Ohio as we get set 
to pass this relief bill before us. 
This week, Congress will pass the fourth aid 
bill to help Americans. And much like the pre-
vious bill, the CARES Act, the bill before us in-
creases funding levels for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program and the Economic Injury Dis-
aster Loan program, while also ensuring our 
health care system receives the support it 
needs. 
In addition to providing $370 billion of relief 
to small businesses, the bill includes $75 bil-
lion more for hospitals; the first tranche of this 
money from the CARES Act’s fund has al-
ready gone out. Hospitals in my district have 
let me know how critical it was to receive this 
support. They have also let me know that 
more is direly needed. This is why we are 
here today; to respond to those calls for more 
help. The PPP and Health Care Enhancement 
Act also includes $25 billion for testing. I know 
from Ohio’s governor that this is a key piece 
of the puzzle in safely reopening economic ac-
tivity. 
Congress must not hesitate in its efforts to 
combat the novel coronavirus. Congress must 
not hesitate in its appropriation of additional 
funds to support America’s small businesses. 
It is imperative we use our time here as Rep-
resentatives of our communities and the full 
capabilities of the federal government to pro-
tect Americans—both in terms of health and 
economic security. We will defeat this virus 
and we will emerge from this unprecedented 
time a stronger, more resilient nation. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill 
and stand with small businesses and those on 
the front lines—without which, our nation 
would most certainly not be the global beacon 
of opportunity and freedom it is. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, this emergency 
legislation makes key investments in programs 
that are critical to helping our hospitals and 
health providers continue to respond to 
COVID–19. 
It also improves our testing capacity, which 
will be critical to combating the pandemic and 
reopening out economy. 
This is not a perfect package, but no bipar-
tisan agreement ever is. 
It does not include clearer metrics for the 
hospital funding that l think is necessary to en-
suring that funding is distributed in a way that 
is fair and equitable, transparent, and respon-
sive to the areas that are treating the highest 
number of COVID–19 patients. 
I also do not believe that the COVID–19 
testing strategy is as strong as I would have 
liked. Right now, the Trump Administration has 
no clear plan, no clear benchmarks, and no 
clear timelines for setting up a national pro-
gram that will reopen our economy. We must 
hold this Administration accountable for its 
abysmal response to testing, and I hope that 
we will be able to do more in the next pack-
age. 
Having said that, l want to acknowledge the 
good in this bill, because l do believe it will 
provide some additional relief and guidance

that our states and local governments, terri-
tories, tribes, hospitals, and providers des-
perately need. We simply could not afford to 
wait, and thanks to our efforts we are pro-
viding some critical relief. 
First, we include another $75 billion for the 
CARES Provider Relief Fund, or the hospital 
fund. This is $75 billion in addition to the $100 
billion funding provided in CARES. 
These funds can be used to reimburse hos-
pitals or providers for expenses or lost reve-
nues as a result of COVID–19. 
The language remains the same as the 
CARES Act, so it will be critical that we con-
tinue to fight for clearer metrics for how future 
funding allocations will be distributed so that 
health care entities receive the funding they 
need to continue to treat patients and keep 
their doors open. We will also fight for trans-
parency so that we have more real-time ac-
counting of who is receiving these dollars and 
how much funding they are receiving. 
We also address the critical issue of testing 
by making an additional investment of $25 bil-
lion. As the Speaker has been saying, testing 
is a essential component to how we respond, 
treat, and stop the transmission of this virus. 
Valid, widespread testing is going to be nec-
essary if we are to reduce social distancing ef-
forts and reopen parts of our economy. 
The $25 billion investment in testing will be 
used for expenses related to all different areas 
of testing, including: research, development, 
validation, manufacturing, purchasing, admin-
istering, and expanding capacity for COVID– 
19 tests. This includes rapid point-of-care tests 
and serological tests. 
Of that $25 billion, $11 billion will go to 
states, localities, territories, and tribes to de-
velop, purchase, administer, process, and 
analyze COVID–19 tests. It will also fund scal-
ing-up laboratory capacity, contact tracing, 
monitoring and surveillance, and supporting 
the workforce. 
$2 billion of this $11 billion will go to the 
States consistent with the Public Health Emer-
gency Preparedness grant formula, ensuring 
every state receives funding, and $4.25 billion 
will be allocated based on a state’s relative 
number of COVID–19 cases. Tribes, tribal or-
ganizations, and urban Indian health organiza-
tions will receive $750 million for testing activi-
ties. 
This $25 billion also includes key invest-
ments in our federal public health agencies— 
$1 billion is provided to CDC for surveil-
lance, epidemiology, laboratory capacity ex-
pansion, contact tracing, public health data 
surveillance and workforce to support the ex-
pansion and improvement of COVID–19 test-
ing; 
$1.8 billion is provided to NIH to develop, 
validate and improve testing, including further 
development of rapid point-of-care and sero-
logical testing; 
$1 billion is provided to BARDA for ad-
vanced research, development, manufacturing, 
production, and purchase of diagnostic, sero-
logic, or other COVID–19 tests or related sup-
plies. 
$22 million for the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration to support activities associated with di-
agnostic, serological, antigen, and other tests; 
and 
$600 million to support testing activities at 
Community Health Centers, and $225 million 
to support testing activities at rural health clin-
ics. 
Finally, the package also includes up to $1 
billion to cover the costs of testing for the un-
insured. 
And there are some other key Democratic 
priorities that were included in the package— 
reporting on demographic information related 
to testing, diagnoses and hospitalizations, and 
the requirement of a testing plan. 
While the Republicans would not support 
real-time reporting of demographic data, we 
were able to include regular demographic data 
reporting—that is to be de-identified and 
disaggregated. This includes data on race, 
ethnicity, age, sex, geographic region, and 
other factors for COVID–19 cases, hospitaliza-
tions, and deaths, and epidemiological anal-
ysis of such data. 
We also were successful in adding a re-
quirement for the Administration to submit a 
COVID–19 strategic testing plan that will detail 
how the Administration will increase domestic 
testing capacity and testing supplies, address 
disparities, and provide assistance and re-
sources to states, localities, territories, and 
tribes. The plan is also required to include es-
timates of testing production and guidelines for 
testing, as well as an outline of Federal re-
sources that will be able to support the testing 
plans of States, localities, territories, tribes, 
and tribal organizations. 
This is an important provision—the Adminis-
tration has been running away from trying to 
come to develop a federal testing plan. This 
requires them to do so. 
While I would have required a more detailed 
report, with clearer benchmarks for the activi-
ties I just mentioned, including specific plans 
for adequate testing in underserved areas and 
populations, and expanding surveillance and 
contact tracing, this is a good first step. 
We will all have to work together to hold this 
Administration accountable to produce a clear 
strategy for testing that will help us to reduce 
the spread of this virus, clearly identify cases 
and individuals with immunity, and expand ca-
pacity so that testing can help inform what 
communities may be able to reopen safely 
and without a surge in new cases. 
These will be a priority as well as we draft 
the next package. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 266, the Paycheck 
Protection Program and Health Care Enhance-
ment Act. Though this bill is far from perfect, 
it provides much needed temporary assistance 
to small business owners and hospitals im-
pacted as a result of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
This bill includes additional funding for the 
Paycheck Protection Program and makes sev-
eral vital corrections to loopholes in the pro-
gram from the CARES Act. A lack of proper 
oversight in the previous package gave lend-
ers the ability to pick and choose their 
loanees, therefore leaving smaller businesses 
like hair salons, independent restaurants, and 
dry cleaners, who may not have an estab-
lished banking relationship, left without suffi-
cient financial assistance. I am proud that 
House Democrats fought to include $60 billion 
in funding designated specifically for small and 
medium-sized lenders, which will go a long 
way in supporting small businesses bearing 
the brunt of this crisis. 
Additionally, this bill provides critically need-
ed funding and resources to support our hos-
pitals, medical clinics, and local testing capa-
bilities. We must ensure that when our com-
munities are faced with this public health 
emergency, our healthcare system can pro-
vide the urgent medical attention they need. 
Included in this bill is $75 billion in funding to 
the Public Health and Social Services Emer-
gency Fund to provide resources to the med-
ical frontlines, including for personal protective 
equipment and health provider reimburse-
ments. It also designates $25 billion in funding 
for COVID–19 testing expenses and mandates 
the development of a national strategic testing 
policy, focused on increasing domestic testing 
capacity, including capacity for testing sup-
plies. 
I am fighting for the city of Dallas, and all of 
the incorporated municipalities in my district, 
that are getting hammered by the necessary 
stay at home orders, to make sure that we re-
ceive funding to provide for essential services 
like fire and police. 
As I mentioned before, this bill is far from 
perfect. Two priorities that must be addressed 
in upcoming packages are the need for in-
creased funding to SNAP, due to the expo-
nential need for food assistance in our com-
munities, and expanded federal assistance to 
smaller municipalities like the cities of Cedar 
Hill, DeSoto, Duncanville, and Lancaster, in 
my district. Now, more than ever, we must en-
sure that the most vulnerable among us are 
protected and that our local governments have 
the resources to support them. 
At the same time, I am inspired to see orga-
nizations step up to the plate and help people 
in this time of need. Just last week, the North 
Texas Food Bank, along with the Texas Na-
tional Guard, Fair Park First, Spectra, and In 
the City for Good distributed 6,500 boxes of 
food to over 2,200 households across the re-
gion. Looking at images of cars lined up for 
miles waiting to receive food should serve as 
a reminder of how much more we must do to 
ensure our constituents are successfully able 
to navigate through this crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, now is the time to provide crit-
ical funds and support for our neighborhood 
businesses; owners and employees. Now is 
the time for us to provide critical funds and 
support to the hospitals who will be fighting to 
keep our friends, family, and neighbors alive 
through this pandemic. It is my sincere hope 
that the next COVID–19 bill will better serve 
all of our constituents. I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, as we 
continue the fight to help our constituents and 
all Americans as they face the devastating 
coronavirus crisis, I am voting today in strong 
support of H.R. 266, The Paycheck Protection 
Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act, to 
help protect American families, workers, and 
small businesses. 
Democrats successfully fought to improve 
today’s interim emergency relief package by 
ensuring greater access for small businesses 
in underserved areas, and by successfully 
adding billions more in funding for testing, 
hospitals, and the PPE for health care workers 
who are caring for those infected by the 
coronavirus. 
For small businesses, this final agreement 
strengthens the Paycheck Protection Program 
with $310 billion in additional funding, more 
than the $250 billion initially requested. Demo-
crats were able to set aside $60 billion to help 
unbanked and underserved businesses get 
access to PPP funding, including minority- 
owned businesses, urban and rural busi-
nesses, small ‘‘mom-and-pop’’ businesses,

and smaller nonprofits. This $60 billion in-
cludes $30 billion for community-based lend-
ers and small banks and credit unions, and 
another $30 billion for medium-sized banks 
and credit unions. The agreement also ex-
pands small business support beyond PPP by 
securing $50 billion for Small Business Admin-
istration disaster lending, which translates into 
more than $350 billion in loans, and $10 billion 
in SBA disaster grants. 
For hospitals and health care workers, 
Democrats secured $75 billion to help pay for 
Personal Protective Equipment and other re-
sources. The Trump Administration has also 
agreed to key improvements to be made in 
CARES 2, including significantly lowering the 
interest rate on advance payments, length-
ening the repayment schedule, and distributing 
payments from general revenues instead of 
the Hospital Insurance Fund. 
For all Americans, we added $25 billion for 
testing, which is pivotal to reopening the econ-
omy and resuming our lives. The Trump Ad-
ministration has agreed to a national strategic 
testing policy focused on increasing domestic 
testing capacity, including testing supplies. 
I am also voting today to establish a bipar-
tisan 
House 
Select 
Committee 
on 
the 
Coronavirus Crisis, which will help ensure we 
fight this pandemic with an efficient, effective, 
and science-based federal response which 
saves lives and spends taxpayer dollars wise-
ly. 
The legislation we pass today will protect 
countless American lives and livelihoods. 
However, we have much more to do. Next, 
we must pass a CARES 2 Act that builds on 
the bipartisan CARES Act we passed last 
month, so we can keep helping our families, 
workers, and small businesses to stay safe, 
stay healthy, and make ends meet. 
And because the Trump Administration 
made the unconscionable decision to reject 
more funding for state, local, and tribal gov-
ernments so they can pay their essential work-
ers, we must redouble our commitment to in-
clude that funding in CARES 2. If govern-
ments cannot pay first responders, transpor-
tation personnel, and other crucial workers, we 
are all put at grave risk. 
In these troubling times, the American peo-
ple are looking to Congress for support, guid-
ance, and leadership in the fight against the 
insidious COVID–19 virus. Today, tomorrow, 
and every day, I will continue to do all I can 
to keep my constituents and my country safe, 
and to provide the resources needed for the 
development of a vaccine that will defeat this 
virus for good. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote 
in support of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
266—the Paycheck Protection Program and 
Health Care Enhancement Act. 
This legislation builds upon and makes a 
number of important improvements to the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act, which Congress passed less 
than a month ago to help our country continue 
the fight against COVID–19. 
Specifically, this legislation adds more than 
$300 billion to the Small Business Administra-
tion’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP), which has provided a critical lifeline to 
small businesses around the country as we 
continue to deal with the economic fall-out 
from this global pandemic. I am proud that 
Democrats stood our ground and were able to 
carve out $60 billion from this fund for small 
and mid-sized banks, credit unions, and com-
munity-based lending institutions to help en-
sure that unbanked and underserved busi-
nesses can access the PPP. This includes mi-
nority-owned businesses, rural businesses, 
small ‘mom and pop’ businesses, and smaller 
nonprofits that too often have been pushed to 
the back of the line for this program, while bil-
lion-dollar chains have accessed funding. 
I am also pleased that this legislation in-
cludes $60 billion for SBA’s Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan (EIDL) and Emergency Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Grant program. I have 
heard from dozens of businesses who applied 
for EIDL relief only to never hear back from an 
overwhelmed and underfunded SBA. This 
funding will allow these emergency programs 
to provide flexible assistance to small busi-
nesses and nonprofits. 
Again, thanks to congressional Democrats, 
this legislation also includes an additional $75 
billion in relief to hospitals and health care 
providers for expenses or lost revenue attrib-
utable to COVID–19. While I believe we need 
much more than $75 billion, these additional 
funds will be crucial for helping providers who 
are bearing the brunt of this crisis, including 
Community Health Centers and rural providers 
who are facing layoffs and massive revenue 
shortfalls due to cancellation of ‘elective’ pro-
cedures. 
Congressional Democrats also fought for 
and secured $25 billion to expand our nation’s 
COVID–19 testing capacity, $11 billion of 
which will go directly to states, localities, terri-
tories, and tribes to help them bolster testing 
shortfalls in their communities. Widespread 
testing is the key to fighting this virus, reopen-
ing the economy, and protecting the health 
and wellbeing of Americans so that we can 
safely begin to resume our normal lives. We 
also successfully inserted provisions to require 
the Trump administration to finally create a na-
tional strategic testing plan that details how 
our country will increase domestic testing ca-
pacity, address disparities, and provide assist-
ance and resources to states, localities, terri-
tories, and tribes. 
This legislation is not without glaring omis-
sions, though. Unfortunately, despite bipar-
tisan support for additional funding, the Trump 
administration and congressional Republicans 
refused to add any additional funding for state, 
local, and tribal governments. These entities— 
who are on the front lines of this crisis—are in 
a dire financial position. I will continue to push 
for this desperately-needed investment and to 
ensure that funding flows directly to smaller lo-
calities. 
Future legislation must also ensure strong 
support for families with an increase to SNAP 
benefits to help put food on the table. Repub-
licans stonewalled all efforts to include this in-
crease in this legislation. 
For our front-line workers, we are simply not 
doing enough to support them. We need to 
ensure that any additional legislation man-
dates that the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) implements a robust 
emergency temporary standard to strengthen 
protective measures for our health care work-
ers, first responders, postal carriers, retail em-
ployees, grocery workers, transportation work-
ers, and more. We should also be supporting 
these individuals with hazard pay as they con-
tinue to report to work and risk exposure to 
COVID–19 in order to perform their essential 
duties for the betterment of our communities. 
Congress must also address the critical situ-
ation the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is in. 
Despite bipartisan support for stronger relief, 
the administration forced weak and restrictive 
aid for USPS into the CARES Act. Without 
significant steps, the Postal Service could 
cease operations by June. For the millions of 
people who count on the USPS every day— 
including seniors and veterans—this is not an 
option. 
We can and must also give additional, direct 
support to the American people. This includes 
additional economic impact payments, more 
comprehensive relief for homeowners and 
renters, stronger steps for the millions of stu-
dent loan borrowers, and more. 
Congress should also finally take up legisla-
tion to reform enormously important issues like 
prescription drug costs and surprise billing. 
These issues have long plagued our broken 
healthcare system, and they will continue to 
do so once we beat this virus. 
Lastly, we must begin moving to the next 
phase of this crisis: economic recovery. Con-
gress must pass legislation that creates jobs 
and rebuilds our decaying infrastructure. As 
Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee, I will continue to push for an 
infrastructure package that repairs the breach 
left by years of neglect—that rebuilds failing 
bridges, restores crumbling highways, and 
puts people to work on projects with jobs that 
cannot be exported. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) that the

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CAS-
TOR
of Florida). Pursuant to House 
Resolution 938, the resolution (H. Res. 
935) 
establishing 
a 
Select 
Sub-
committee on the Coronavirus Crisis as 
a select investigative subcommittee of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, is considered as adopted. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 935 
Resolved, That there is hereby established a

Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner ap-
pointed by the Speaker, of whom not more 
than 5 shall be appointed on the rec-
ommendation of the minority leader. The 
Speaker shall designate one member of the 
select subcommittee as its chair. Any va-
cancy in the select subcommittee shall be 
filled in the same manner as the original ap-
pointment. 
(b) Each member appointed to the select 
subcommittee shall be treated as though a 
member of the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform for purposes of the select sub-
committee. 
SEC. 3. (a) The select subcommittee is au-
thorized and directed to conduct a full and 
complete investigation and study and issue a 
final report to the House of its findings (and 
such interim reports as it may deem nec-
essary) regarding— 
(1) the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and 
transparency of the use of taxpayer funds 
and 
relief 
programs 
to 
address 
the 
coronavirus crisis, including through Federal 
agencies, State and local government enti-
ties, financial institutions and other private 
businesses, contracts, grants, loans, loan 
guarantees, investments, cooperative agree-
ments, or any other means; 
(2) reports of waste, fraud, abuse, price 
gouging, profiteering, or other abusive prac-
tices related to the coronavirus crisis; 
(3) the implementation or effectiveness of 
any Federal law applied, enacted, or under 
consideration to address the coronavirus cri-
sis and prepare for future pandemics; 
(4) preparedness for and response to the 
coronavirus crisis, including the planning for 
and implementation of testing, containment,

sexual 
orientation, 
disability, 
and 
geo-
graphic region, and any measures taken to 
address such disparate impacts; 
(7) executive branch policies, deliberations, 
decisions, activities, and internal and exter-
nal 
communications

and others with Congress, the Inspectors 
General, the Government Accountability Of-
fice, and others in connection with oversight 
of the preparedness for and response to the

HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP 
Z.L. GRADY 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and pay tribute to the life and 
legacy of a great leader in the African Meth-
odist Episcopal (AME) Church, Bishop Zede-
kiah LaZett (Z.L.) Grady who transitioned on 
Sunday, April 19th. Bishop Grady was one of 
my spiritual and political mentors and—like 
many others—I will always cherish his mem-
ory. 
Z.L. Grady was born the son of Walter and 
Sylvira Bynum Grady in Loughman, Florida. 
Education was extremely important to him, 
and he was a life-long learner. He was edu-
cated in Sanford, Florida public schools and 
graduated from Crooms Academy. He at-
tended Florida’s Edward Waters College and 
the B.F. Lee Theological Seminary, where he 
earned A.A. and B.Th. degrees before earning 
a B.A. degree from Allen University, in Colum-
bia, South Carolina, and a M.Div. degree from 
Dickerson Theological Seminary. He continued 
his theological studies at the Union Theo-
logical Seminary in New York and the Urban 
Training Center in Chicago, Illinois. Bishop 
Grady was awarded honorary doctorate de-
grees from Kittrell College, Allen University 
and Edward Waters College. 
While Bishop Grady was a highly respected 
AME church leader, his influence spread far 
beyond the church walls. He was a pastor and 
an astute administrator who excelled and had 
many great successes in both roles. He also 
wore the mantle of civic organizer, social re-
former, and teacher. These roles enabled him 
to make indelible marks on many commu-
nities. 
I met Bishop Grady when I was a young 
public-school teacher in Charleston, South 
Carolina. Although I was born and had grown 
up in a Church of God parsonage, and my 
wife, Emily, had been born and grew up in a 
United Methodist Church family, we were 
drawn to and often attended Morris Brown 
AME Church where Z.L. Grady was pastoring 
at the time. It was under his influence and tu-
telage that we became AMEs. 
He demonstrated to us what the Bible 
means by ‘‘faith without works is dead.’’ Not 
only did he preach the Word on Sundays, he 
often played instrumental roles in civic and 
community activities throughout the week. His 
role in the infamous 1969 Charleston Hospital 
Workers strike was pivotal. He joined with 
ministers at Emanuel and Ebenezer AME 
churches to build affordable housing on Johns 
Island, a sea island near Charleston. He insti-
tuted a daycare center and kindergarten at 
Morris Brown and our first-born began her for-
mal education in that kindergarten. He began 
a radio broadcast of the church services. 
During his time in South Carolina, he served 
as Chairman and Vice Chairman of the South 
Carolina Juvenile Parole Board, Chairman of 
the Charleston Community Race Relations 
Committee, Member of the Charleston Hous-
ing Authority, and a Board Member of C&S 
National Bank and NationsBank. And he 
served as an advisor to elected officials on the 
municipal, state and federal levels. 
As he rose in church and civic leadership, 
Bishop Grady’s work took him outside South 
Carolina to share his talents with the world. 
He was elected the 111th Bishop of the AME 
Church in 1992, and served in the 16th, 9th 
and 1st Episcopal Districts. 
One of my most memorable experiences 
was arriving at the AME University in Mon-
rovia, Liberia with the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, NANCY 
PELOSI, and us being greeted by Bishop 
Grady. He wanted it to be a surprise and it 
was. 
Bishop Grady retired from his official role at 
the AME General Conference. His civic mem-
berships included being a life member of the 
Beta Mu Sigma Chapter of the Phi Beta 
Sigma Fraternity, Inc. and a life member of the 
NAACP. 
Bishop Grady leaves to cherish his memory 
his wife Carrie Etta Robertson Grady, a native 
of Winnsboro, South Carolina, who served ad-
mirably at his side throughout their leadership 
journey with the AME Church. The two were 
parents of four children and five grandchildren, 
one of whom Carey has followed him into the 
ministry and was my first Congressional In-
tern. 
Madam Speaker, l ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in honoring the life of this 
religious and community leader and recog-
nizing the tremendous positive impact Bishop 
Z.L. Grady made in South Carolina and 
around the world. Although he will be sorely 
missed, we are all better for his service 
among us.

THE 
CORONAVIRUS CRISIS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following 
letter in support of the creation on the Select 
Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis: 
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, April 13, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. JAMES E. CLYBURN, 
Majority Whip, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER HOYER, AND 
WHIP CLYBURN: I write today to express my 
strong support for the creation of the House 
Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis, 
and to thank you for your leadership of the 
House of Representatives’ ongoing work in 
response to the unprecedented public health 
and economic crises we are facing. I also 
thank you for your continued focus on ensur-
ing effective oversight of the trillions of tax-
payer dollars that are being directed to sup-
port our nation’s recovery. 
As work continues on the establishment of 
the Select Committee, I write to recommend 
specific cross-cutting issues regarding imple-
mentation of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act, the Fami-
lies First Coronavirus Response Act, and 
other legislation addressing the coronavirus 
pandemic that require sustained oversight 
from the Select Committee. My comments 
encompass three broad areas, as described in 
more detail below. I appreciate your consid-
eration of these recommendations and look 
forward to working closely with you and the 
Select Committee to address these urgent 
issues. 
STRUCTURE, OPERATIONS, AND FIRST 
PRIORITIES 
To be most effective, the Select Committee 
must be capable of producing hard-hitting 
findings and concrete recommendations in 
near real-time to help shape the course of 
the Federal response. The Select Committee 
must be organized quickly, and it must be al-
located the robust budget necessary to en-
sure it is staffed by experts in such fields as 
public health, economics, public finance, and 
the operations of Federal programs. 
As there may be sustained efforts to im-
pede oversight of the Federal response to the 
pandemic, the Committee must quickly es-
tablish effective working relationships with 
the oversight entities created in CARES and 
other legislation and with agency Inspectors

General. However, the Committee must also 
be prepared on day one to seek relevant doc-
uments and information, particularly re-
garding those programs deemed to be at high 
risk, and it must be agile in responding to 
the information it receives. 
I strongly agree the Committee must work 
to eliminate ‘‘waste, fraud, and abuse’’ and 
‘‘price gouging and profiteering.’’ The Select 
Committee must also be the central mecha-
nism the House uses to measure Federal ex-
penditures against two critical, over-arching 
benchmarks: 
their 
effectiveness 
in 
sup-
porting recovery among those most affected 
by COVID–19 and their effectiveness in pre-
venting and preparing for future waves of in-
fection. In addition to examining specific ex-
penditures, the Committee must also closely 
examine the responsibilities, authorities, 
and capacities of both Federal and state 
agencies charged with implementing the 
CARES Act and other legislation related to 
the pandemic, and hold senior agency leader-
ship accountable for managing programs in 
ways that will achieve national recovery and 
preparedness objectives while effectively 
stewarding taxpayer resources. 
There are two key priorities that require 
immediate attention. First, the Select Com-
mittee must conduct comprehensive over-
sight of the supply chains through which 
personal protective equipment (PPE) and es-
sential medical supplies and equipment are 
distributed to states. The Committee on 
Homeland Security has written to the De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS), the 
Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS), and the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency (FEMA) seeking basic informa-
tion on distributions of PPE and essential 
medical supplies and equipment from the 
Strategic National Stockpile, as well as the 
subsequent Federal role in acquiring PPE 
and medical supplies and equipment, sup-
porting private supply chains, and actively 
managing the sale of PPE and essential med-
ical supplies and equipment to states and 
counties. 
To date, DHS, HHS, and FEMA have failed 
to provide the documents and information 
sought by the Committee. Ensuring that all 
health care workers have the PPE and med-
ical supplies and equipment they need to test 
and treat patients with COVID–19 is one of 
the most urgent issues facing the nation at 
this time, and yet Congress has little visi-
bility into the opaque and evolving roles of 
DHS, HHS, and FEMA in the acquisition and 
distribution processes. The Select Com-
mittee must quickly initiate oversight over 
this issue. 
Similarly, the Select Committee must con-
duct thorough oversight of testing processes, 
particularly as the country prepares to begin 
relaxing social distancing protocols. The 
availability of testing kits and effective con-
tact tracing procedures when new cases of 
COVID–19 are diagnosed will be essential to 
enabling the nation to safely resume near- 
normal economic activity, and oversight of 
these processes must be a key priority for 
the Select Committee. 
FOCUS ON MINORITY COMMUNITIES 
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY COVID–19 
Although additional data are clearly need-
ed, emerging evidence indicates that commu-
nities of color are disproportionately af-
fected by COVID–19, and that mortality may 
be much higher among minorities than 
among other groups. For example, in my 
state of Mississippi, approximately 38% of 
residents are African Americans. However, 
the State Department of Health has reported 
that, as of April 9, 2020, 54% of those diag-
nosed with COVID–19 are African American 
while 35% are white. Further, 67% of those 
who had died from COVID–19 in the state as 
of April 9 were African American, while 33% 
were white. African Americans who died 
from COVID–19 were also far more likely to 
have had underlying health conditions such 
as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These 
infection, morbidity, and mortality statis-
tics demonstrate the disproportionate effect 
of COVID–19 on communities of color. 
Unfortunately, the trends observed in Mis-
sissippi appear to be prevalent across the na-
tion. For example, according to the New 
York Times, ‘‘The coronavirus is killing 
black and Latino people in New York City at 
twice the rate that it is killing white peo-
ple’’ according to preliminary date released 
last week by the City of New York. And an 
analysis by the Washington Post found that 
‘‘counties that are majority-black have three 
times the rate of infections and almost six 
times the rate of deaths as counties where 
white residents are in the majority. Keeping 
in mind that minority communities may 
have more limited access to testing for 
COVID–19, it is also possible that rates of in-
fection, 
morbidity, 
and 
even 
mortality 
among minorities are being under-reported. 
The Select Committee must document the 
disproportionate impact of COVID–19 on 
communities of color. All aspects of the 
Committee’s work must be informed by this 
data so that the Committee can maintain a 
laser-focus on detailing how Federal policies 
are responding to this disproportionate im-
pact by addressing the many factors that 
leave minority communities so vulnerable to 
this disease. 
The Select Committee must review public 
health strategies to ensure that they address 
the heightened risks of infection and death 
from COVID–19 in minority communities. 
The Committee must also rigorously assess 
the extent to which under CARES and other 
legislation, Federal expenditures in the 
healthcare, education, social welfare, and in-
dustry rescue sectors address the pandemic’s 
disproportionate effects on minority commu-
nities, including the extent to which expend-
itures narrow or exacerbate the inequality 
prevalent before the crisis, and whether ex-
penditures improve resilience among at-risk 
communities. Similarly, as part of its review 
of small business lending, the Select Com-
mittee must carefully review lending pat-
terns to disadvantaged business enterprises. 
Finally, it is likely that highly vulnerable 
populations—such as children, individuals 
with special needs, and the elderly—may face 
unique and especially difficult long-term 
consequences as a result of the pandemic and 
the economic displacement it causes. Of par-
ticular concern is addressing the impact of 
the crisis on children. Just over 16% of chil-
dren in the U.S. lived in poverty in 2018—and, 
sadly, that figure is likely to spike as a re-
sult of the coronavirus pandemic. Science is 
also clear that adverse childhood events 
(ACES) can ‘‘have lasting, negative effects 
on health, well-being, and opportunity.’’ 
While poverty is not itself an ACE, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) identifies it as an associated condition 
and warns that together, ‘‘ACES and associ-
ated conditions, such as living in under- 
resourced or racially segregated neighbor-
hoods’’ and ‘‘experiencing food insecurity’’ 
can lead to ‘‘toxic stress,’’ which ‘‘can 
change brain development’’ in ways that 
have life-time consequences. At a time when 
millions of families are losing employment 
and struggling to make ends meet—and chil-
dren may be unable to attend school for as 
long as half a year—the Select Committee 
must examine the unique needs of children 
during this crisis and assess how Federal aid 
efforts are meeting these needs. 
PRIORITIZING THE PROTECTION OF WORKERS 
Obviously, the Select Committee must 
carefully review the loans, loan guarantees, 
and other investments made in eligible busi-
nesses in distressed economic sectors under 
CARES and other legislation, including the 
covenants, representations, warranties, and 
other requirements imposed as conditions of 
aid. However, because of the Senate’s unwill-
ingness to impose stricter worker-protection 
criteria, the CARES Act has only limited 
protections to ensure that businesses receiv-
ing aid prioritize the retention of workers 
‘‘to the extent practicable.’’ The Committee 
must therefore document the full impact of 
Federal aid to industry on job retention, 
workers’ wages and benefits, and economic 
recovery among low-income and middle-class 
Americans, including assessing the trajec-
tory of recovery among different income 
brackets and the long-term consequences of 
potentially uneven recovery on economic in-
equality among Americans. 
The Committee must also closely assess 
whether Federal aid is comprehensively ad-
dressing what may be the profound cascade 
of economic harms that the prolonged shut-
down of economic activity needed to slow 
the spread of coronavirus will impose on low- 
income and even middle-class families. Ac-
cording to the Federal Reserve, even before 
the pandemic hit, approximately 40% of 
Americans reported that they would have 
‘‘difficulty’’ covering an extra expense of 
$400, and minorities were more likely than 
other groups to report they would face such 
difficulty. The harms suffered by those who 
were already living on the margins as a re-
sult of this crisis are likely to be severe and 
multi-faceted. 
The direct payments and expanded unem-
ployment benefits provided by CARES and 
other legislation will provide essential sup-
port in the short-term, but the disruptions 
workers and their families face will likely 
lead to unforeseen conditions that may con-
tinue to destroy household wealth. Newly 
unemployed Americans will also be facing 
challenges unique to this moment, including 
the need to seek new work at a time when 
the national economy will likely be con-
tracting. The Select Committee must assess 
whether Federal expenditures address in a 
comprehensive manner the full spectrum of 
harms families may face. 
Finally, many of those who have lost their 
jobs as a result of the pandemic will also lose 
their employer-sponsored healthcare. While 
newly unemployed individuals and families 
could seek insurance on the exchanges cre-
ated by the Affordable Care Act or may even 
qualify for Medicaid, as you well know, the 
‘‘Trump administration in recent years has 
also added more red tape and obstacles for 
people looking to sign up for those programs 
and hasn’t shown any signs it will waive 
those requirements because of the pandemic. 
It is imperative that the Select Committee 
examine 
how 
the 
hurdles 
intentionally 
placed in the way of accessing health care 
under the Affordable Care Act are affecting 
those who lose health insurance when they 
become unemployed as a result of the 
coronavirus. 
CONCLUSION 
I truly appreciate your leadership in these 
unprecedented times. A Select Committee is 
urgently needed to conduct oversight of the 
issues of greatest concern to the American 
public during our ongoing effort to combat 
COVID–19 and restore our economy, and I 
thank you for the opportunity to share these 
observations and recommendations regard-
ing that Committee’s work. Please do not 
hesitate to contact me whenever I may be of 
any assistance. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman.

BEST WISHES TO MICK MULVANEY 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the people of South Carolina are so 
appreciative of the achievements and success 
of former Congressman Mick Mulvaney serv-
ing as White House Chief of Staff for Presi-
dent Donald Trump. 
I include in the RECORD a deserved tribute 
published by John Feerhery with his column 
entitled ‘‘Mulvaney fit for Northern Ireland 
Post’’ in The HILL on March 10, 2020. 
To the untrained eye, Mick Mulvaney’s de-
parture as White House chief of staff and ap-
pointment as the president’s special envoy to 
Northern Ireland might seem to be a bit cu-
rious and a big demotion for the former con-
gressman from South Carolina. 
But those who know Irish politics under-
stand that this new assignment is very im-
portant to the United States and that 
Mulvaney is well suited to take it on. 
For his entire time in the White House, 
Mulvaney has developed deep relationships 
within the Irish government and with key 
actors in Northern Ireland. These relation-
ships became critical as Great Britain nego-
tiated its departure from the European 
Union and created a special status for North-
ern Ireland and its border with the Republic. 
Most analysts expect that Great Britain 
and the United States will start negotiating 
a free trade agreement once the dust settles 
on Brexit. But any FTA must acknowledge 
Northern Ireland and the reality of the all- 
Ireland economy, a reality that some nego-
tiators might want to ignore. It all gets very 
complicated. 
Ireland has done well over the last decade, 
bouncing back from the dark days of the 2008 
financial crisis. Unemployment is at historic 
lows, property values are at historic highs, 
and growth is the strongest of any country 
in Europe. Multi-national corporations from 
around the world, especially the United 
States, choose to headquarter in Ireland be-
cause of its highly trained workforce and its 
very favorable corporate tax rates. Those 
corporate tax rates cause heartburn in Brus-
sels, but all political parties in Ireland sup-
port them, even the left-leaning Sinn Fein. 
Northern Ireland has a good story to tell, 
as well. They have a highly educated popu-
lation, a favorable regulatory regime and in-
creasingly close economic ties to their island 
neighbor. But they also have the lingering 
legacy of the Troubles, pockets of persistent 
economic hardship, border communities that 
lack access to any infrastructure and a frag-
ile political structure that hasn’t been func-
tioning for over three years. 
And the reality is that Northern Ireland 
and Ireland are, at the moment, two dif-
ferent countries with two different outlooks, 
two different attitudes towards the future, 
two different views of the past. Integrating 
these two different countries economically 
while respecting their different political and 
cultural traditions is not going to be easy. 
The Good Friday accords, negotiated by 
George Mitchell, another special envoy from 
the United States, are the basis for the cur-
rent power sharing agreement in Northem 
Ireland. It has been two decades since that 
agreement was reached, and for the most 
part, they have held up pretty well. That the 
United States was central to bringing an end 
to the Troubles was no accident. No other 
country has the ability to serve as an honest 
broker to both sides, a role that continues to 
this day. 
Making sure that the United Kingdom con-
tinues to vigilantly honor the Good Friday 
accords is one of Mick Mulvaney’s central 
tasks. Another is to make certain that Ire-
land doesn’t get ahead of itself when it 
comes to talk of a unified island. Sinn Fein, 
the dominant Catholic political party in the 
North, surprised observers and gathered the 
most votes in the last election in the Repub-
lic. Talk of a new border poll, a vote to see 
if the majority in the North would want to 
unify with the South, immediately ensued. 
But time is not ripe for those discussions. 
Let’s see how things develop in the post- 
Brexit world first. 
Mick Mulvaney, whose grandparents hail 
from Country Mayo, knows the players and 
knows the issues that separate them. He 
knows that America must play the indispen-
sable role in continuing to broker peace and 
to make sure that Ireland as an island suc-
ceeds both economically and socially. 
Serving as chief of staff to President 
Trump undoubtedly had its challenges. This 
new assignment will prove to be challenging 
too.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF HOT SPRINGS VILLAGE 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Hot 
Springs Village. The largest gated community 
in North America with land spreading across 
20,000 acres of Garland and Saline Counties, 
Hot Springs Village has long been a commu-
nity vital to the Fourth District of Arkansas. 
April 20, 2020 marks 50 years since the com-
munity’s founding by local developer John 
Cooper Sr. and his family. 
Boasting an extensive list of recreational ac-
tivities, a deep appreciation for local art, cul-
ture, and history, beautiful scenery of the 
Ouachita Mountains and nearby Hot Springs 
National Park, Hot Springs Village has be-
come one of the premiere retirement commu-
nities and tourist destinations in the United 
States. 
Using the expression ‘‘Proud Past and 
Strong Future,’’ the Hot Springs Village 50th 
Anniversary Planning Committee strives to 
make this year-long ‘‘party’’ a celebration of 
the Village’s rich history and a platform to dis-
cuss its future successes. While the Village 
leadership has already hosted several celebra-
tion events throughout the early part of this 
year, local citizens can expect a schedule of 
events to celebrate the founding of this close- 
knit community until December 2020. 
I take this time to recognize the work of this 
citizenry’s leadership, their commitment to 
community, and their 50 years of success. For 
many in the Fourth District of Arkansas, Hot 
Springs Village serves as a model reminder of 
the values we all hold dear and the homes we 
all strive to create.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, all communities are grateful to all our 
health care heroes in the State of South Caro-
lina. Throughout this national emergency, they 
have been on the front lines working long 
hours to keep our communities safe. Hospitals 
and community medical centers are unselfishly 
serving patients with the Wuhan Virus. 
Citizens correctly appreciate Aiken Regional 
Medical Center led by CEO Jim O’Loughlin, 
Lexington Medical Center under the leadership 
of President and CEO Tod Augsburger, 
Prisma Health Richland Hospital under guid-
ance of President and CEO Mark O’Halla, 
Providence Health of Columbia with Terry 
Gunn’s leadership as CEO, Regional Medical 
Centers Orangeburg Hospital and Bamberg- 
Barnwell Emergency Medical Center, both 
under guidance of CEO Charles Williams, and 
Rural Health Services Inc. led by CEO Caro-
lyn Emanuel-McClain. 
From performing tests to helping patients re-
cover, they have been and remain leaders in 
our community. I am grateful to have worked 
with my colleagues in the 116th Congress to 
provide needed funding for vital personal pro-
tective equipment and ventilators.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MAC 
JARAMILLO 
HON. GILBERT RAY CISNEROS, JR. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of a man from my 
district and to mark, in his passing, both what 
we have lost and what we must refuse to lose 
as our country faces a great crisis. This man 
was not lost to the COVID–19 pandemic. But 
his memory almost was. Mac Jaramillo was 
born on March 10th, 1927 in Hanford, Cali-
fornia, and died peacefully a few miles from 
his La Habra, California home on March 22nd 
of this year. Mr. Jaramillo was not a great 
statesman, not a wealthy man, at least in ma-
terial things, nor was he any kind of dignitary 
except to his family, his community, and his 
church. I only learned about Mac from his chil-
dren who reached out to my office asking for 
help in remembering him because in the midst 
of our public health crisis, Mac’s family and 
friends were denied a funeral mass. They 
were nearly barred from his burial altogether. 
On April 7th, Mac, a man who was rich in 
friends and family, was buried by his parish 
priest and nine family members. The many 
more people who loved him and wanted to 
render their respects were denied that oppor-
tunity. That is why I felt the need to speak, so 
that an American who came from the hum-
blest of roots, who carried himself with great 
humility and dignity, who sought little for him-
self, who served his country in the Second 
World War, and who not only exemplified the 
American dream but helped build and expand 
it for his children, could be remembered and 
honored. This is not then merely a gesture to 
a grieving family; it is a reminder of the great 
stock of which our country is made and how 
the example of men like Mac give us strength 
when we are called to answer our own chal-
lenges. 
Mac’s father and mother, Fortino and Sotera 
Jaramillo started their family in the State of 
Guanajuato where, like many other peasant 
farmers of the revolutionary era in Mexico, 
they had trouble feeding themselves between 
harvests. Like my ancestors, they sought 
greater opportunities in an Estados Unidos 
that was often hostile to them even as it prof-
ited from their labor and skill. The City of Han-
ford became their home, but they really lived 
across California’s great Central Valley and 
out to its lush Central Coast. The seasonal 
rhythm of migrant farm work brought the fam-
ily out of Hanford every March and down to 
the lettuce and bean fields in coastal Nipomo 
and Santa Maria. Then it was north to San 
Jose to pick cherries and pears. By August, 
the family would find work back in the central 
valley grape regions and only return to Han-
ford in September for the cotton harvest. 
The Jaramillos worked hard for little. Tough 
times in the 1920s became unimaginably 
harsh by the early 1930s as the country sank 
into the depths of the Great Depression and 
the winters left the children hungry. For the 
family, the winter of 1934, when the average 
temperatures in Hanford hovered in the low 
40s, was the worst of the Depression. It was 
that year that the family lost Mac’s youngest 
brother who succumbed to a combination of 
cold and influenza. But even in the face of 
such tragedy, the family carried on. For mea-
ger wages, they lent their backs to the agricul-
tural colossus of the Central Valley that fed 
and clothed so much of the nation in those 
lean years. It was a system of work that cost 
Mac a formal education as he left school in 
the eighth grade to join his parents and sib-
lings in the fields. 
It was the body he developed in those fields 
that gave him the physical strength to carry 
his two brothers out of their bedroom during a 
1941 house fire. The fire had engulfed their 
bedroom and the two brothers were already 
unconscious from smoke inhalation when Mac, 
a mere boy of 14, saved their lives without 
even a thought for his own. In the summer of 
1945, Mac was inducted into the US Army. He 
served as an infantryman and a firefighter in 
the Second World War. Though he was garri-
soned in Panama and never saw combat, on 
at least two occasions he showed his courage 
again fighting fires, first aboard a heavily laden 
ammunition ship and later rolling barrels of oil 
down the side of a mountain before they were 
engulfed in flames. Heroism and quick action 
in the face of fire seemed to be a theme in 
Mac’s life. Even in middle age, when a neigh-
bor’s house was set ablaze by fireworks, he 
instinctively jumped into action putting out the 
fire and saving the house before the La Habra 
Fire Department arrived. 
Like most men of his generation, Mac 
Jaramillo came home from the war with wider 
eyes and bigger ambitions. Building on skills 
he had acquired in the service, Mac no longer 
worked in the fields but as machinist running 
cotton gins. In 1955, he joined his brother 
Dave in La Habra, working first in a packing 
house, then in manufacturing plants in La 
Habra, Brea and Placentia. He purchased a 
Texaco gas station and ran it for three years. 
Until, with his GI Bill benefits, he decided on 
barber college. He worked in a variety of 
shops until founding his own barbershop in 
downtown La Habra. Then in 1969, searching 
for better benefits, and perhaps looking for 
something to distract him from the recent loss 
of his child Lucy Lita to Leukemia the year be-
fore, Mac started a new chapter. At the age of 
42, he became a Teamster and drove RC 
Cola deliveries for 19 years until he finally re-
tired to tend a modest garden of roses and 
fruit trees. 
But Mac Jaramillo’s real ambitions were al-
ways to be a faithful servant to his God and 
family. In 1956 he met and married his wife of 
63 years, Lucina Quintero. Together they used 
his GI Bill benefits to buy a home in La Habra 
where they raised eight children. All eight chil-
dren received their baptism, first communion, 
and confirmation in La Habra’ s Our Lady of 
Guadalupe Church, where Mac and Lucina 
were married and Mac remained a parishioner 
until his passing. The couple taught their chil-
dren to revere God, protect the family, and 
love their country. They also taught their chil-
dren to seize opportunities. Mac and Lucina’s 
proudest achievement was to see all eight of 
their surviving children graduate from La 
Habra High School and to watch two of them 
graduate from the California State University 
at Fullerton. 
Mac Jaramillo left this world as the beloved 
patriarch of a large and proud family, he regu-
larly entertained groups of 30 to 40 at Christ-
mas and other holidays. Indeed, it is a great 
irony that this family man, this veteran of the 
greatest generation, this partner in America’s 
post-war prosperity, who loved his church, his 
family and his community so much more than 
he loved himself, was denied a public mass 
and a large burial reception. He is survived by 
his wife Lucina, brother Greg, sisters Lita and 
Mary, children Carlos, Dona, Mack, Eileen, 
Inez, Joachim, Peter, Lucy, 24 grandchildren, 
and 23 great-grandchildren, seven of whom 
have followed in the patriarch’s footsteps by 
serving in the Army, Air Force or Marines. 
With this, we have tried to ease the hurt of 
this one family by helping to remember Mac 
Jaramillo and the life he led. I feel we all gain 
from learning about him. He isn’t the kind of 
man who history will normally take note of. But 
if we can remember him and the millions like 
him who built the American and Californian 
dream out of the ruins of the Great Depres-
sion and the Second World War, if we can re-
member their courage as well as their kind-
ness and humility, then how can we despair 
for our future. God bless Mac Jaramillo, his 
family, Our Lady of Guadalupe where he wor-
shipped, his adopted city of La Habra, the 
people of my district, and the country we all 
love.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
EMER-
GENCY CANNABIS SMALL BUSI-
NESS HEALTH AND SAFETY ACT 
OF 2020 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has upended life as we 
know it and has impacted every aspect of 
American society. The abrupt health and eco-
nomic turmoil caused by COVID–19 has left 
businesses, workers and families questioning 
the security of their futures. Our nation’s small 
businesses are among those who have felt 
this pandemic most acutely. To prevent work-
ers from choosing between their health and a 
paycheck we passed sweeping and unprece-
dented legislation to shield American busi-
nesses from the full economic consequences 
of COVID–19. However, state-legal cannabis 
small businesses were excluded from this eco-
nomic relief and remain ill-equipped to re-
spond to the health and economic crisis be-
fore them. 
Small businesses across the country are 
being asked to do their part in keeping their 
workers, customers, and families safe. To sup-
port these efforts, on March 27, 2020, the 
President signed into law the CARES Act, 
which contains $376 billion in relief for Amer-
ican workers and small businesses. However, 
many state-legal cannabis small businesses 
are not eligible for this-relief and are being 
asked to protect workers and their families 
without the federal support available to other 
American small businesses. State-legal can-
nabis entrepreneurs and their workers are no 
different from those of other industries, and 
since COVID–19 does not discriminate, the in-
ability of certain groups to protect themselves 
could inadvertently jeopardize the health of us 
all. 
The Emergency Cannabis Small Business 
Health and Safety Act would open access to 
SBA assistance relating to COVID–19 to state- 
legal cannabis businesses and their service 
providers. Specifically, this legislation would 
allow state-legal cannabis businesses to be el-
igible for the Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP), Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), 
and Economic Injury Disaster Loans emer-
gency advances. Among other things, this 
support is specifically designed to be used to 
pay workers, group health benefits and paid 
sick leave. 
The health and safety of the American peo-
ple must be put first during the COVID–19 
pandemic. Without doing so, we risk under-
mining the efforts of us all.

SUPPORTING H.R. 266, THE PAY-
CHECK 
PROTECTION 
PROGRAM, 
AND H. RES. 935, THE HEALTH 
CARE ENHANCEMENT ACT 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, today 
the House will consider the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program and Health Care Enhancement 
Act, crucial legislation to deliver resources our 
small businesses and health care providers 
need to confront the coronavirus outbreak. I 
will not attend House proceedings today but if 
present would have voted YEA on H.R. 266 
and YEA on H.Res. 935 to establish a Select 
Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. 
This public health crisis has upended busi-
nesses in my community and across the coun-
try. Additional resources for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program will ensure these businesses 
can retain employees and are ready to partici-
pate in our economic recovery. Further, addi-
tional resources for our healthcare system—in-
cluding $825 million for Community Health 
Centers—will make sure these essential orga-
nizations can continue to serve our commu-
nities during this pandemic. 
I am proud of the efforts of House Demo-
crats to strengthen this legislation, including 
securing key resources for testing and allo-
cating small business loans to community- 
based lenders that have strong relationships 
with local small businesses. 
While I am proud of this bipartisan agree-
ment, we must re-double our efforts in the 
weeks ahead to develop a relief plan that 
paves the way for our economic recovery.

BATTLING THE PANDEMIC—A 
POEM 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, at a time of national emergency, it is 
inspiring that the positive ‘‘It Can Be Done’’ 
American Spirit is appreciated. 
I include in the RECORD a meaningful con-
tribution by Joan M. Lacombe, the Poet Lau-
reate of Aiken, South Carolina, published in 
the Aiken Standard. 
BATTLING THE PANDEMIC 
They have closed the building, but not the 
church! 
We will continue to reach out to the needy 
and distressed, 
Vowing not one soul left to be missed. 
For the church is not a building constructed 
by man. 
It is made of ‘‘we the people,’’ God’s message 
to bring. 
The church embodies the God-crafted Tem-
ples of the Holy Spirit 
Where we all lovingly dwell within. 
The cancellation of liturgies, a dramatic 
move, 
New rules or worship set in place, health 
conditions to protect; we to obey. 
Heartbreaking—as it disrupts our Lenten 
Journey 
To have this taken away when we need it 
most—a bitter irony. 
Together we will get through this— 
It is not for us to fall into a faithless abyss. 
For we Christians are persevering 
As our Easter goal we are nearing.

HONORING THE LIFE OF KRISTIN 
JACOBS 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I, along 
with Representative DEUTCH, rise to honor the 
life of our dear friend, Florida State Represent-
ative Kristin Jacobs. 
We were heartbroken to learn of her pass-
ing and join Floridians in mourning this tre-
mendous loss to Broward County and the 
state of Florida. 
Representative Jacobs began her career in 
public service on the Broward County Com-
mission, eventually serving as Mayor in 2012. 
She served in the Florida House of Represent-
atives from 2014 until her passing on April 11, 
2020. 
She was a groundbreaking environmental 
leader and fierce protector of Florida’s lakes, 
streams, and oceans. She spearheaded the 
development of the Southeast Florida Re-
gional Climate Compact, created the Broward 
Water and Climate Academy, and during her 
term as Mayor, was selected to serve on 
President Obama’s Task Force on Climate 
Preparedness and Resilience. Representative 
Jacobs fought her illness just as she fought for 
our community—with determination, resilience, 
and grace. She was smart and tough and 
stood up for her beliefs, always backing them 
with facts and data. 
Even while she underwent chemotherapy 
treatment for cancer, she remained an active 
member of the Florida State Legislature, serv-
ing her constituents from her hospital bed. 
Kristin was the most genuine, decent, car-
ing, and effervescent person. She was a loyal, 
real, and true friend, and we will miss her 
deeply. 
Our hearts are with her three children, three 
grandchildren, and all her extended family. 
May her memory be a blessing.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF RABBI 
ALAN MAYOR SOKOBIN 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker. I rise today 
to honor the life of Alan Mayor Sokobin, Rabbi 
Emeritus 
of 
The 
Temple—Congregation 
Shomer Emunim in Sylvania, Ohio. Rabbi 
Sokobin suddenly passed from this life on Fri-
day April 3, 2020. 
Rabbi Sokobin was a giant in our commu-
nity. Learned, faith-filled, a family man, loving, 
a leader, compassionate, a World War II vet-
eran, funny, high-spirited, reverent, a commu-
nity leader and so much more. As we mourn 
Rabbi Sokobin’s passing, in the midst of Pass-
over, as the Jewish people commemorate the 
exodus from Egypt to the promised land, they 
recognize the importance of welcoming the 
stranger, to opening one’s home and the 
Passover dinner table to the other. Rabbi 
Sokobin spent his life welcoming the stranger 
and his imprint on our community is writ large, 
his contributions invaluable. 
Alan Mayor Sokobin was born on March 8, 
1926 in Newark, New Jersey, to parents Pau-
line and Max. At the age of fifteen he slipped 
away from his family to join the Navy, honor-
ably serving in Europe and Japan. After the 
war he graduated from Syracuse University, 
and then pursued rabbinic studies at Hebrew 
Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. He went on 
to receive his Doctor of Theology degree from 
Burton College. Marrying the love of his life on 
May 19, 1957, together he and Mickey raised 
two children and eventually presided over a 
family including five grandchildren. 
Rabbi Sokobin came to our community in 
1972 to join the congregation as co-rabbi with 
Leon Feuer. He soon established himself as 
an intellectual and ecumenical community 
leader, pairing with Toledo’s mayor to improve 
Toledo Municipal Court, chairing the Labor- 
Management-Citizens Committee, and working 
with 
Promedica 
Health 
System. 
Rabbi 
Sokobin’s greatest gift to the faith community 
was the partnerships he formed with Toledo’s 
faith leaders in the Catholic, Muslim, and other 
religious traditions. 
After officially retiring in 
1992, 
Rabbi 
Sokobin decided to go to Law School and 
graduated in 1996. He was named out-
standing student of his class by a vote of fac-
ulty members. Rabbi Sokobin remained a con-
stant figure not only in his congregation, but 
our community as the years passed into this 
decade. His wise counsel was sought and 
carefully considered regarding issues of the 
day. His thoughtful countenance and astute 
observations were treasured. Yet, it was al-
ways the most charming sight to see Rabbi 
Sokobin pull a balloon ever present in his 
pocket and fashion an animal as children— 
and adults—watched in wonder. 
The young Anne Frank noted ‘‘Our lives are 
fashioned by our choices. First we make our 
choices. Then our choices make us.’’ Rabbi 
Alan Mayor Sokobin chose to live his life serv-
ing God with his whole heart,’’ a choice that 
made many all the richer. He spent his days 
putting the pieces of the world back together, 
he worked to fix the disconnected, to repair 
the world—he truly embodied tikkun olam. 
Today we mourn at his passing, but we cele-
brate his life and the progress he made to fix 
our broken world. We offer our heartfelt con-
dolences to his family as they mourn this great 
man.

mark 10 years since the tragic Smolensk 
plane crash, which killed 96 people including 
President Lech Kaczynski and Polish First 
Lady Maria Kaczynska. On April 10, 2010, a 
Polish state delegation was heading to Smo-
lensk, Russia, to commemorate the murder of 
nearly 22,000 innocent Polish citizens by the 
Soviet secret service NKVD in the spring of 
1940 during World War II. The gruesome 
crash in the thick fog near Smolensk in west-
ern Russia was Poland’s worst air disaster 
since World War II and completely stunned 
the country as scores of military political lead-
ers were killed in one fell swoop. 
The American people stand with the people 
of Poland in solemn commemoration of this 
horrible national tragedy that still reverberates 
throughout Polish society to this very day. The 
Soviet Union was complicit with Nazi Germany 
in the oppression of the courageous people of 
Poland. Despite the ongoing Wuhan Virus, 
senior Polish officials laid wreaths at the 
monument to the victims of the Smolensk air 
disaster at the Pilsudski Square in Warsaw 
earlier this month. 
Unfortunately, questions relating to the 
cause of this tragedy still linger. Although an 
official Polish government investigation con-
cluded that the crash was caused by pilot 
error, suspicions of foul play persist. At the 
memorial earlier this month, Polish President 
Andrzej Duda said, ‘‘After 10 years, it’s difficult 
to say anything or predict whether the case 
can ever be resolved.’’ This is mainly because 
Russia has consistently refused to turn over 
basic evidence to the Polish state. The Rus-
sian government is still in possession of the 
plane wreckage including the black boxes that 
could provide more clarity. 
In a press statement from earlier this month, 
Poland’s Foreign Ministry renewed demands 
that Moscow return the wreckage of the 
Tupolev aircraft that crashed so that the Polish 
people can finally find some closure. Russia’s 
refusal to turn over evidence raises many sus-
picions, despite claims by Russia’s Investiga-
tive Committee that crew errors led to the ac-
cident. 
The American people support the Polish 
Foreign Ministry’s calls to return the wreckage 
to Poland, as well as the Ministry’s assertion 
that ‘‘no norm of international law gives 
grounds for Russia to impound Polish prop-
erty.’’ We stand with the people of Poland in 
remembering the victims of this awful tragedy 
and supporting efforts for a transparent inves-
tigation into its cause to provide a measure of 
justice to the victims and their families. 
The Embassy of the Republic of Poland in 
Washington is well represented by Ambas-
sador Piotr Antoni Wilczek, promoting the 
message to never forget this catastrophe. 
President Andrzej Duda is appreciated in 
America. Democratic Post-Communist Poland 
is the only country in Europe to have 25 years 
of uninterrupted economic growth, which I saw 
firsthand in January. I particularly know the 
significance of America’s beloved Polish- 
American Community of 10.5 million citizens. 
My daughter-in-law Jennifer Miskewicz Wilson 
is grateful for Krakow heritage and her asso-
ciation with Poet Adam Mickiewicz. 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN F. (JACK) 
BARRY 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the career of one of my 
longtime constituents from Millis, Massachu-
setts, John F. (Jack) Barry, and to congratu-
late him on his retirement this coming April 
after 40 years of service with the American 
Hospital Association. 
Jack has held several leadership positions 
at the AHA since 1980, including a temporary 
assignment from 1993 to 1995 in Washington, 
where he directed the association’s regional 
operations during the Congressional delibera-
tions over national health reform legislation. 
Since 1996, Jack has served as the AHA’s re-
gional executive in New England. He has 
worked with the region’s six state hospital as-
sociations and hundreds of member hospitals 
to direct grassroots advocacy on issues of im-
portance to hospitals. 
Jack has long had ties to both Massachu-
setts and Washington, D.C. Born in Newton, 
he earned a B.A. in journalism from George 
Washington University in 1976 and an M.B.A. 
with a concentration in health care manage-
ment from Boston University in 1991. 
Jack looks forward to enjoying his retire-
ment with his best friend and spouse of 38 
years, Ellen Kelly, a retired nurse; his daugh-
ter Elizabeth; his son Patrick; and the host of 
friends and colleagues he has amassed over 
the years. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Jack Barry and wishing him and 
his family much happiness as he begins the 
next chapter of his life.

strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Mindy Freel for winning the Adams County 
Mayors and Commissioners Youth Award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments. 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SELFLESS 
AMERICANS WORKING ON THE 
FRONTLINES 
TO 
BATTLE 
THE 
CORONAVIRUS 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to all the brave men and women of 
this country who are risking their own lives 
every day to help our nation get through this 
terrible coronavirus pandemic. They are our 
emergency first responders, doctors, nurses, 
grocery store employees, members of the 
postal service and those who work in the ship-
ping and delivery industries. Their continued 
service throughout this crisis means life or 
death for some patients fighting off this dis-
ease, and it also means that our families can 
continue to have the food and products we all 
need to survive. 
Our local newspaper, Florida Today, re-
cently highlighted the efforts of fifteen Brevard 
County nurses as they rushed to aid Ameri-
cans suffering from COVID–19 in the town of 
Taunton, Massachusetts, a hard-hit community 
just south of Boston. These brave nurses, cur-
rently on staff with Rockledge Regional Med-
ical Center, answered the call for help and vol-
unteered to go for two weeks to treat seriously 
ill COVID–19 patients. Since being there, they 
have vowed to stay as long as they are need-
ed. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize 
the selfless acts of nurses Jennifer Nelson, 
Lorraine Blake, Tandy Beck, Allison Salidino, 
Betty ‘‘Joanne’’ Crespo, Deidra Gansel, Jill 
Barrett, Amanda Tebault, Lisa Colon, Arlene 
‘‘Solly’’ Salzwedel, Kris Smith, Nora George, 
Linda Fleming Dutton, Kara Ehrhardt and 
Gena Gillespie. These are real life heroes. 
‘‘When I first walked into ICU, I thought, 
‘Oh, my goodness. What is this?’ It looked 
like, to coin a phrase, a war zone,’’ Nurse Ar-
lene ‘‘Solly’’ Salzwedel was quoted describing 
the situation saying in Taunton. ‘‘The house-
keepers do not come in to clean the rooms at 
all. That’s the job of the nursing staff. So not 
only are you the patients’ nurse, you’re their 
cleaner. You’re their spiritual support system, 
even though they’re intubated and heavily 
sedated.’’ 
Andy Romine, President of Rockledge Re-
gional Medical Center, said originally thirty 
nurses had volunteered to go to Massachu-
setts, but our own needs in Brevard County 
required some to stay and care for patients in 
our own community. ‘‘Our organization is very 
proud of them for their willingness to put their 
safety at risk to care for others—their courage 
and selflessness is a source of pride for us,’’ 
said Romine. Since then, forty-five other 
nurses have traveled to Boston to treat the 
surging cases of COVID–19 putting their lives 
at risk. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in saluting these 
brave nurses, and all of the selfless Ameri-
cans who are risking their lives every day to 
help the American people overcome this seri-
ous coronavirus pandemic.

April 23, 2020 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, after 
consulting with physicians about traveling dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic, I was not able to 
make it to Washington for this vote, but I 
would have voted YES on the Senate Amend-
ment to H.R. 266. Our local small businesses 
are facing unprecedented circumstances due 
to the COVID–19 crisis, with many struggling 
to keep all of their employees on payroll. The 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was a 
solution passed unanimously by the House 
just a few weeks ago, providing loans that 
keep Americans employed across the country. 
It was no surprise that demand for these loans 
was high, but it was a surprise to see mem-
bers of Congress hold up more funding for the 
PPP over partisan political demands. I am 
glad to see my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle finally bring up this vital bill for a 
vote today to provide the relief that so many 
businesses and workers need. Estimates al-
ready predict that this additional funding will 
keep over 103,000 workers on payroll. 
Unfortunately, the Speaker’s push for the 
creation of a new select committee to conduct 
oversight of the response to COVID–19 is an-
other attempt to use taxpayer dollars to fulfill 
partisan goals. There are already eight dif-
ferent mechanisms in place for the House to 
exercise oversight over the response to this 
virus, making this new one completely redun-
dant. It is clear that this committee is intended 
to score political points against the President 
rather than improve our pandemic response. If 
that is the goal, it should be funded by their 
campaigns, not by American taxpayers. That 
is why I would have voted NO on the Resolu-
tion Establishing a Select Subcommittee on 
the Coronavirus Crisis.

DOUBLE DOWN ON HEALTH TIES 
WITH ISRAEL 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, in the midst of the coronavirus pan-
demic, we are fortunate our alliance with Israel 
has never been stronger with the leadership of 
President Donald Trump and Prime Minister 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu. 
Amid 
international 
lockdowns and cancellations due to the ongo-
ing coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. and Israel 
quietly marked a major milestone in our mili-
taries’ bilateral defense relationship. For the 
first time ever, on March 29 U.S. and Israeli 
F–35s trained together in Israel in a combined 
air-power exercise dubbed ‘‘Enduring Light-
ning.’’ Despite coronavirus-related cancella-
tions across the globe, this exercise over 
Israeli skies illustrated the strength and endur-
ance of the military cooperation between our 
two nations. Our militaries have worked to-
gether for years to fight the threat of terrorism 
and defend our way of life from those that 
seek to threaten it. Today, as we all face the 
universal threat of COVID–19, it’s time we en-
sure that our cooperation with our friends in 
Israel relating to public health is as prioritized 
as our strong defense ties. 
It’s no surprise that defense has long been 
at the forefront of our bilateral cooperation 
with Israel. But our collaboration with Jeru-
salem spans all sectors of our society and our 
government-to-government 
collaboration 
on 
public health goes back decades. In 1985 
when the Department of Health and Human 
Services signed a Memorandum of Under-
standing with the Israeli Ministry of Health. 
The MOU provided for the exchange of infor-
mation between the two countries, joint train-
ing and education, conferences, and collabo-
rative projects. 
But our bilateral work on public health is 
certainly not limited to government-to-govern-
ment cooperation. The nature of cooperation 
between the United States and Israel, in every 
field, is based on the deep respect, friendship, 
and affection between Americans and Israelis. 
Just last month, the Israeli pharmaceutical 
company Teva announced it will donate more 
than six million doses of the anti-malarial drug 
hydroxychloroquine sulfate to hospitals across 
the United States. More than ever, we can ap-
preciate person-to-person friendships as evi-
denced by the American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee (AIPAC) so ably led by President 
Betsy Berns Korn and Chief Executive Officer 
Howard Kohr. 
It is no secret that for years Israel has been 
at the forefront of breakthrough scientific re-
search and technology. Just last week, the 
Galilee Research Institute in Israel announced 
it was on the cusp of developing a vaccine for 
the coronavirus, with estimates that it could be 
ready within a few weeks and available within 
90 days. The Israel-based company Pluristem 
developed a placenta-based cell therapy treat-
ment that has shown a 100 percent survival 
rate among severely ill COVID–19 patients 
and has just begun treating American patients 
days ago. During this crisis, Israel has also 
developed new, more affordable methods of 
producing ventilators and personal protective 
equipment that could change the way we re-
spond to epidemics in the future. As we move 
forward in the fight against COVID–19, we 
would be wise to double down our health co-
operation with Israel. There is no doubt that 
our two countries will benefit from information 
sharing related to the virus’ spread, treatment, 
and containment. 
I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to 
support deepening our health ties with the 
Jewish State. As Ranking Member of the Mid-
dle East and North Africa Subcommittee on 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I work 
closely with colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to prioritize the U.S.-Israel relationship. 
I’m grateful to be the lead Republican with 
Chairman TED DEUTCH (D–FL) on H.R. 1837, 
the United States-Israel Cooperation Enhance-
ment and Regional Security Act which among 
other things seeks to deepen our collaboration 
with Israel on health issues. 
The bill calls for close collaboration with 
Israeli institutions on research and treatment 
of post-traumatic stress disorder, with which 
Israelis have, unfortunately, had a lot of expe-
rience given their current security situation. It 
also authorizes and funds a bilateral coopera-
tive program with Israel for the development of 
health technologies, including artificial intel-
ligence, biofeedback, and kidney care. Impor-
tantly, the bill, which passed the House of 
Representatives in July of last year, also in-
cludes language support for setting up a Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) regional office 
in Israel to facilitate joint work on critical 
issues relating to health. Last November, I 
was grateful to co-lead a letter with the Chair-
man of the Helsinki Commission, ALCEE HAS-
TINGS, to HHS Secretary Alex Azar under-
scoring that the establishment of an FDA of-
fice in Israel, ‘‘would facilitate collaboration in 
life-saving research and is a natural step for 
strengthening the special relationship between 
our countries.’’ 
There has never been a better time to in-
vest in robust bilateral health cooperation be-
tween the United States and Israel. Victory 
against the Invisible Enemy will require close 
collaboration with partners across the globe, 
especially with true friends like Israel. It’s time 
we deepen the ties between Washington and 
Jerusalem for the sake of global public health.

Byrd, Michelle Lewandowski, Nicole Ortiz, 
Heather Kvale, Holly Mohon, Shauna Rasor, 
and Ji-Youn Yeo. 
Not many hospitals have a molecular de-
partment, but UTMC does. Thanks to the work 
of these highly trained women specialists, and 
the UTMC lab capabilities, COVID–19 testing 
was made available for our entire region and 
results dropped from an 8 day wait period to 
just 48 hours. And the lab is poised to invent 
even better results with the research funds 
Congress has passed. 
These swift test results have had a priceless 
impact on the lives of people in our commu-
nity. Quick test results help us identify sick pa-
tients, get them the care they need, and pre-
vent further spread. Their work brings our 
community great pride in their accomplish-
ments at the precious labs of UTMC. I will 
continue to support their efforts at UTMC as 
the country works to ratchet up production and 
make widespread testing more available. 
In the difficult circumstances Americans find 
ourselves in, hope must not be forgotten. The 
rays of hope we see in our researchers and 
caregivers’ dedication to heal and find solu-
tions to this virus serve as a reminder of the 
resiliency of our community and the strength 
of America as a whole in an interdependent 
world. Today, America thanks you—the To-
ledo Rocket women of science—who helped 
bring testing to our region. To quote Abraham 
Lincoln—you are ‘‘the better angels of our na-
ture.’’ 
[From the Blade, Apr. 1, 2020] 
HOW UTMC SPECIALISTS WORKED SWIFTLY TO 
BRING CORONAVIRUS TESTING TO AREA 
(By Brooks Sutherland) 
Around the same time the United States 
reported its first case of coronavirus, molec-
ular specialists at the University of Toledo 
Medical Center had already begun discus-
sions to bring in-house testing capabilities 
to its pathology lab. 
It was that foresight that paved the way 
for 
coronavirus 
testing 
capabilities 
at 
UTMC, the former Medical College of Ohio 
hospital, under a U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration Emergency Use Authorization, to 
sprout in just weeks. 
Testing in Lucas County previously took 
up to eight days for results to finalize even 
as concerns around the global pandemic con-
tinued to heighten and the number of con-
firmed cases skyrocketed nationwide. 
But today, the lab at UTMC can test up to 
180 samples a day and returns take 48 hours 
or less. That quick turnaround is possible 
thanks to efforts from molecular specialists 
such as Ji-Youn Yeo and Heather Kvale and 
a handful of others at UTMC, according to 
Cynthia O’Connell, the administrative direc-
tor of the medical center’s pathology lab. 
‘‘We have a molecular department, and not 
many hospitals do,’’ she said. ‘‘So we have a 
lot of specialists and they worked tirelessly 
to make this happen.’’ 
Understanding its impact during a health 
crisis, Ms. Kvale added: ‘‘We really wanted to 
bring this in house, so it would reduce the 
turnaround time for our patients.’’ 
‘‘I’m really glad that we’re able to decrease 
that time so that people don’t sit there in 
limbo,’’ she said. 
But in order to bring testing capability to 
UTMC, the molecular diagnostics specialists 
had to validate a testing kit to show it was 
accurately providing results. Thankfully, the 
lab was already equipped with the correct 
machine and the kit before they became in 
short supply. 
In order to validate testing, lab workers 
collaborated with Beaumont Health, which is 
based in Royal Oak, Mich., and the Ohio De-
partment of Health to gather known positive 
and negative specimens which were in turn 
used to test accuracy. 
Ms. Yeo’s expertise in molecular genetics 
then helped the lab modify the test to keep 
employees safe during the process, Ms. Kvale 
said. But that modification then had to be 
validated, she said. 
‘‘She’s really brilliant,’’ Ms. O’Connell 
added of Ms. Yeo. 
Ms. Yeo declined to be interviewed, but in 
a prepared statement said members of the 
pathology team ‘‘worked fast together,’’ to 
put all the pieces in place to bring testing to 
northwest Ohio. 
Dr. James Willey, a UT professor who spe-
cializes in pulmonary medicine, said Ms. Yeo 
trained and performed her thesis in his Na-
tional Institutes of Health-funded lab, where 
she learned lots of unique skill sets. 
‘‘I’m proud of all those guys,’’ he said. 
‘‘This is really important.’’ 
Dr. Thomas Blomquist, deputy coroner at 
the Lucas County Coroner’s Office, helped 
set up the molecular diagnostics lab and 
hired Ms. Kvale and Ms. Yeo. He said the two 
‘‘deserve a ton of credit,’’ and said he was 
proud that the specialists were able to fend 
off any challenges that stood in the way of 
bringing testing to the area. 
‘‘Molecular testing is really critical for so-
ciety,’’ he said. ‘‘It allows people to have 
quick results so they can be quarantined as 
quick as possible to prevent the spread. This 
is going to have a huge impact.’’

HEROES IN THE WUHAN VIRUS 
PANDEMIC 
HON. JOE WILSON

Thursday, April 23, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, in the midst of the national emer-
gency being successfully faced by President 
Donald Trump and Vice President MIKE 
PENCE, there have been so many citizens 
stepping forward to help fellow neighbors in 
need. I am grateful to recognize heroes who 
are making a difference. 
Journalist Kara Gormley Meador has initi-
ated highlighting innovative citizens efforts to 
address the Wuhan Virus with former S.C. 
Revenue Director Burnie Maybank of the 
Nexsen-Pruet Law Firm. There is free stream-
ing at www.buzzpodcast.com. The first con-
versation was with President Lou Kennedy of 
Nephron Pharmaceutical where she explained 
retooling her operation almost overnight to re-
spond to the virus. She has been welcomed to 
the WVOC Radio in the Midlands with Gary 
David and Christopher Thompson. 
Dale Hatchell and Elizabeth Burt of Lex-
ington have organized Support a Nurse to pro-
vide ‘‘Light of Love’’ care kits to nurses on the 
front lines. These kits are donations of nutri-
tional and immunity products with a support 
message helping the Dorn Veterans Adminis-
tration Hospital, Lexington and Prisma hos-
pitals, and Department of Juvenile Justice. 
Talk radio host Kevin Cohen has been re-
lentlessly providing important updates for the 
Midlands of South Carolina, fulfilling his goals 
on The POINT promoting charities and local 
events. 
Halsey Cook, Chief Executive Officer of 
Milliken & Company of Spartanburg is con-
tinuing the visionary tradition of the late Roger 
Milliken. Milliken & Company of Spartanburg is 
developing the manufacturing process for a 
new nanofiber with antiviral properties. 
Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise In-
stitute in The Wall Street Journal (April 12) 
has thoughtfully presented a plan to reopen 
the economy for jobs with companies diag-
nosing coronavirus cases in the workplace. He 
understands healthy citizens need a healthy 
economy. 
Ambassador Andre Haspel of the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands has thoughtfully forwarded 
encouragement to members of the. Congres-
sional Caucus of the Kingdom of the Nether-
lands. The alliance of the Netherlands and the 
United States is strong and appreciated to de-
feat the Wuhan Virus. 
General Milford Beagle, Commander of Fort 
Jackson, with Army Chief of Staff Major Gen-
eral James McConville have been pro-active 
to protect the lives of new recruits and the 
dedicated personnel at Fort Jackson. The in-
stallation trains nearly 50 percent of all Sol-
diers and more than 60 percent of all women 
entering the Army each year. 
Cecil Staton, President and CEO of the 
Asian American Hotel Owners of America, 
with Vice President Chirag Shah have worked 
tirelessly to promote the gruesomely impacted 
hospitality industry. AAHOA is the largest hotel 
owner’s association in the world with 20,000 
members owning half of hotels in America. 
Walgreens Drug Stores with the dedicated 
staff in West Columbia is appreciated for fea-
turing ‘‘Thanks to our frontline heroes’’. On 
Saturday, first responders, law enforcement, 
doctors and nurses will receive 30 percent off 
Walgreens brands and 20 percent off other 
brands. Drug stores, grocery stores, conven-
ience stores and grocery stores, truckers, and 
other essential enterprises have been vital 
services for communities.
