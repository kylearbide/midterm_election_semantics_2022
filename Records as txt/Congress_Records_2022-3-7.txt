Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MARCH 7, 2022 
No. 40 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. BUTTERFIELD). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
March 7, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable G. K. 
BUTTERFIELD to act as Speaker pro tempore 
on this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 1:50 
p.m. 
f 
CRISIS AT OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER CONTINUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, last week President Biden ad-
dressed Congress and the Nation and 
claimed that he was committed to se-
curing our southern border, but sadly 
his actions have not matched his 
words. 
According to Border Patrol reports, 
there were over 150,000 migrant encoun-
ters at our southern border just during 
the month of January, a 96 percent in-
crease from the previous year. As we 
stand here today, more drugs like 
meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl are 
pouring into our country through our 
southern border. 
President Biden had a chance to offer 
solutions to this crisis at the State of 
the Union, but instead he gave flippant 
remarks that belittled the struggles 
that American families are currently 
facing. 
We cannot afford to leave our south-
ern border open any longer. We cannot 
afford to let these drugs continue to 
kill the fathers, mothers, sons, and 
daughters in our communities. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for President 
Biden to get serious about the crisis at 
our southern border. It is time to give 
law enforcement the tools that they 
need. It is time to keep our commu-
nities once again safe. 
f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
BETTY WUNDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the memory of Betty 
Wunder, who dedicated many of her 82 
years providing unconditional care and 
comfort 
to 
children 
and 
adults 
throughout Oklahoma in her profession 
of diagnostic radiology, but primarily 
out of her unwavering view of life guid-
ed by integrity. 
Betty arrived in Oklahoma City at 
the University of Oklahoma Children’s 
Hospital in December of 1971, and im-
mediately 
began 
to 
make 
revolu-
tionary changes in her department. 
She rewrote protocols for pediatric x- 
ray to promote a safer experience for 
children undergoing this procedure, 
which are still used in radiology de-
partments nationwide today. 
Betty quickly rose through the ranks 
inside the Children’s Hospital becom-
ing an associate professor at OU Health 
Sciences Center in 1977 by a unanimous 
vote of the Board of Regents. As with 
every position she held, she took this 
one very seriously and assisted in the 
development of the curriculum for 
what is now the radiology technology 
degree. 
Betty later became the administra-
tive director of radiology in the sum-
mer of 1981. She possessed the rare 
quality of understanding the need for 
everyone involved to be successful and 
rarely allowed the light of honor or es-
teem to be shown to her. From her 
point of view it was always a group ef-
fort or no effort at all. 
In the early 1980s, Betty was instru-
mental in working with others in the 
State to guide the purchase of the first 
MRI machine in Oklahoma at the Chil-
dren’s Hospital. She was very proud of 
this accomplishment and believes it 
put Children’s on the map in terms of 
expanding diagnostic and treatment 
options for Oklahoma children. 
Throughout her career she was a 
member of the American Society of 
Radiologic Technologists and the Okla-
homa Society of Radiologic Tech-
nologists. She received many awards 
and honors during her career, including 
the 1983 and 1986 Radiology Tech-
nologist of the Year. 
In retirement, Betty accepted a posi-
tion 
on 
the 
advisory 
board 
of 
CommunityWorks, an Oklahoma be-
havioral and mental health continuum 
of care. She also reveled in her ability 
to effect care for children and adoles-
cents in the Department of Human 
Services and the Oklahoma Juvenile 
Affairs care. 
She was hands-on with the kids, 
staff, and her beloved quality assur-
ance program. Betty was a teacher to 
all who were prepared and willing to 
learn. She brought out the best in peo-
ple with great respect for their capa-
bilities and humanity. 
Mr. Speaker, she will be missed and 
revered.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, You are our dwelling 
place. Though lives are overturned, 
people are forced to flee from their 
homes, and whole communities are 
being destroyed, You are their refuge. 
Reveal Yourself in the kindnesses of 
strangers, 
the 
abundant 
generosity 
from neighboring communities, and the 
outpouring of support from around the 
world. May these stories of hospitality 
be a testimony to Your provision and 
steadfast love. 
In the erosion of certainty and secu-
rity, this dismantling of normal life, 
underneath are Your everlasting arms. 
The vulnerable who have lost every-
thing, those for whom the foundations 
of life have eroded, catch them in Your 
loving embrace. 
Uphold them not just by the compas-
sion offered and the love shown but by 
the depth of faith shared in You and in 
Your salvation. 
Destroy the wicked intent of the ad-
versary. May all who endure harm this 
day raise the shield of Your help and 
wield the sword of Your righteousness. 
We call upon Your strong and sov-
ereign name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT) come forward and lead 
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. PLASKETT led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
GUARANTEE EQUAL TREATMENT 
FOR 
ALL 
REFUGEES 
FROM 
UKRAINE 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
the nation of Ukraine is dealing with 
an alarming crisis, a war. I have been 
overwhelmed by the number of images 
and stories of families trying to escape 
the terrors and war crimes being un-
justly committed against the people of 
this country. Since February 24, more 
than 870,000—now we understand more 
than 1 million—Ukrainians have fled 
the country. 
However, within that exodus are dis-
turbing reports of mistreatment of 
Black families, Africans, and Asians as 
they try to evacuate a deadly war zone. 
This is unacceptable. 
My office has been working with 
other members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus—Chairman GREG MEEKS 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee and 
BARBARA
LEE
of the Appropriations 
Committee—to determine the veracity, 
the specifics, and the extent of the al-
legations. 
While we stand with Ukraine and en-
courage America’s commitment to the 
Ukrainian Government, any engage-
ment of the United States and Amer-
ican dollars appropriated to humani-
tarian efforts or lethal weapons must 
guarantee that all refugees, all fleeing, 
are treated equally. We will not move 
from that position. 
f 
STOP FINANCING RUSSIA’S OIL 
ECONOMY 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to stand in solidarity with the people 
of Ukraine in the face of unprovoked 
Russian invasion. 
Vladimir Putin’s war has sent mil-
lions of Ukrainians fleeing, and he is 
now targeting civilian populations, 
schools, and hospitals. 
Economic sanctions have begun to 
cripple their economy. Private-sector 
companies have also isolated Russia 
from many aspects of the 21st century 
economy. But unfortunately, all eco-
nomic leverage has not been utilized. 
We must do more. 
I do not support sending American 
troops into this conflict. However, 
America can demonstrate leadership 
by cutting off our purchases of Russian 
oil. But just like on many other as-
pects of this crisis, President Biden is 
playing catch-up. He has yet to take 
the commonsense step of stopping 
American financing of Russia’s oil 
economy. 
Now more than ever, we should be 
massively increasing domestic oil pro-
duction. But President Biden is more 
focused on pandering to his far-left en-
vironmental base than making Amer-
ica energy independent from an enemy. 
We must stop financing Russia’s war 
on Ukraine. President Biden must act. 
f 
END TITLE 42 EXPULSIONS 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
I 
rise today, Madam Speaker, to urge the 
Biden administration to end title 42 
and allow Haitian migrants to request 
U.S. humanitarian refuge before an 
asylum officer or an immigration judge 
in compliance with the Immigration 
and Nationality Act. As of yesterday, 
we saw more than 150 Haitian migrants 
land on our shores in Florida seeking 
asylum. For the last 6 months, we have 
seen more and more Haitian families 
risk their lives to come to our borders 
by sea or by foot. 
The United States continues to use 
title 42, which has been said to be a 
violation of title 42 by the Federal ap-
peals court as of Friday, which they 
said they can’t stomach seeing people 
being deported without due process. 
So, I rise today to ask for the admin-
istration to no longer use title 42 and 
to allow the Haitian immigrants to ac-
tually have due process and be able to 
articulate their need for critical fear. 
I welcome the ruling by the Federal 
court of appeals this past Friday, 
which states that the Biden adminis-
tration may not expel migrants. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GLEN 
MCCALL 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Glen McCall of Ottumwa, Iowa. 
Glen 
passed 
away 
peacefully 
on 
March 2 at Ottumwa Regional Health 
Center following a long battle with pul-
monary fibrosis. 
A native Iowan and an Army veteran, 
Glen and his wife, Kay, lived in Iowa 
for almost 60 years. He worked at CSI 
in Humeston as a radio technician for 
years and then worked as a farmer in 
Leon before moving to Ottumwa as an 
entrepreneur to open McCall Commu-
nications, a two-way radio sales and 
service shop. Glen and Kay ran the 
store for almost 40 years. 
Glen was always happy to give his 
neighbors a helping hand and was a 
longtime member of the Rotary Club of 
Ottumwa, serving as secretary for dec-
ades. 
His kindness, compassion, humor, 
and ever-ready smile were appreciated 
by all those whom he encountered. 
Glen dedicated his life to serving and 
helping the community he loved and 
making Ottumwa the best place to live, 
work, and raise a family.

March 7, 2022 
Glen’s wife, Kay, their children, four 
grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, 
and all his loved ones are in my pray-
ers. 
I would also like to extend a joyful, 
happy 25th birthday to Caroline and 
Charlie Kiley. 
We also stand with Ukraine. 
f 
CONTINUING THE BIDEN BOOM 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, the Biden boom continues. 
Last month, 678,000 jobs were created, 
and unemployment ticked down to 3.8 
percent—less than 4 percent. This fol-
lows the greatest year of job growth in 
American history and the fastest eco-
nomic growth in nearly 40 years. 
But it is not only the fact that new 
jobs were created, Madam Speaker. It 
is also the fact that they are well-pay-
ing jobs—terrific and impressive. These 
jobs have given Americans the dignity 
of a good paycheck and much-needed 
financial breathing room. 
On the public-health front, vaccina-
tion rates have increased 50 percent 
since last March, making it possible for 
99.9 percent of our schools to reopen 
and stay safely open. This is the result 
of strong leadership in the White 
House, Congress’ partnership, and the 
backing of the American people. 
Together, we are building a better 
America, and we are standing strong 
with Ukraine.

HOMELAND SECURITY 
CAPABILITIES PRESERVATION ACT 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5615) to direct the Secretary 
of Homeland Security to submit a plan 
to make Federal assistance available 
to certain urban areas that previously 
received Urban Area Security Initia-
tive funding to preserve homeland se-
curity capabilities, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5615 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Homeland 
Security Capabilities Preservation Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PRESERVATION OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
CAPABILITIES. 
(a) PLAN.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting 
through the Administrator of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, shall sub-
mit to the Committee on Homeland Security 
of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs of the Senate a plan, in-
formed by the survey information collected 
pursuant to subsection (b), to make Federal 
assistance available for at least three con-
secutive fiscal years to certain urban areas 
that in the current fiscal year did not re-
ceive grant funding under the Urban Area 
Security Initiative under section 2003 of the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 604) 
and require continued Federal assistance for 
the purpose of preserving a homeland secu-
rity capability related to preventing, pre-
paring for, protecting against, and respond-
ing to acts of terrorism that had been devel-
oped or otherwise supported through prior 
grant funding under such Initiative and 
allow for such urban areas to transition to 
such urban areas costs of preserving such

March 7, 2022 
(2) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT.—The plan re-
quired under paragraph (1) shall also contain 
a prohibition on an urban area that in a fis-
cal year is eligible to receive Federal assist-
ance described in such paragraph from also 
receiving grant funding under the Urban 
Area Security Initiative under section 2003 of 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In such a 
case, such plan shall require such an urban 
area to promptly notify the Administrator of 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
regarding the preference of such urban area 
to retain either— 
(A) such eligibility for such Federal assist-
ance; or 
(B) such receipt of such grant funding. 
(b) SURVEY.—In developing the plan re-
quired under subsection (a), the Adminis-
trator of the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency, shall, to ascertain the scope of 
Federal assistance required, survey urban 
areas that— 
(1) did not receive grant funding under the 
Urban Area Security Initiative under section 
2003 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 in 
the current fiscal year concerning homeland 
security capabilities related to preventing, 
preparing for, protecting against, and re-
sponding to acts of terrorism that had been 
developed or otherwise supported through 
funding under such Initiative that are at 
risk of being reduced or eliminated without 
such Federal assistance; 
(2) received such funding in the current fis-
cal year, but did not receive such funding in 
at least one fiscal year in the six fiscal years 
immediately preceding the current fiscal 
year; and 
(3) any other urban areas the Secretary de-
termines appropriate. 
(c) EXEMPTION.—The Secretary of Home-
land Security may exempt the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency from the 
requirements of subchapter I of chapter 35 of 
title 44, United States Code (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Paperwork Reduction 
Act’’), for purposes of carrying out sub-
section (b) if the Secretary determines that 
complying with such requirements would 
delay the development of the plan required 
under subsection (a). 
(d) CONTENTS.—The plan required under 
subsection (a) shall— 
(1) establish eligibility criteria for urban 
areas to receive Federal assistance pursuant 
to such plan to provide assistance for the 
purpose described in such subsection; 
(2) identify annual funding levels for such 
Federal assistance in accordance with the 
survey required under subsection (b); and 
(3) consider a range of approaches to make 
such Federal assistance available to such 
urban areas, including— 
(A) modifications to the Urban Area Secu-
rity Initiative under section 2003 of the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002 in a manner 
that would not affect the availability of 
funding to urban areas under such Initiative; 
(B) the establishment of a competitive 
grant program; 
(C) the establishment of a formula grant 
program; and 
(D) a timeline for the implementation of 
any such approach and, if necessary, a legis-
lative proposal to authorize any such ap-
proach. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 5615, the Home-
land Security Capabilities Preserva-
tion Act. 
In the wake of September 11, there 
was a recognition that cities across the 
Nation could be targeted for terrorism 
and that they did not have the re-
sources to develop core capabilities to 
prevent, protect against, and respond 
to terrorist attacks and other cata-
strophic events on their own. 
Starting in 2003, cities across the Na-
tion began receiving dedicated counter-
terrorism grant funding from the De-
partment 
of 
Homeland 
Security’s 
Urban Area Security Initiative grant 
program. 
The UASI program, as it has come to 
be known, provides first responders 
with the tools, resources, and training 
they need to safely and effectively pro-
tect their communities. 
At its height, the UASI program 
funded approximately 60 cities. 
In recent years, however, the number 
of cities receiving funding from the 
program has been reduced to, on aver-
age, 30 each year. 
While support to cities like New 
York, Los Angeles, and Chicago has re-
mained constant, year-to-year fluctua-
tions in grant funding levels and 
changes in DHS’ risk formula have re-
sulted in some cities losing funding un-
expectedly. 
As a result, cities like Orlando, Las 
Vegas, and Omaha face uncertainty 
year after year about whether they will 
receive UASI funding or will be forced 
to try and maintain core homeland se-
curity capabilities on their own. 
The sudden loss of Federal support 
places great strain on cities that often 
lack the resources to cover such unex-
pected costs. 
My bill, the Homeland Security Ca-
pabilities Preservation Act, which is 
cosponsored by my friend from Ne-
braska (Mr. BACON) recognizes the im-
portance 
of 
preserving 
capabilities 
achieved with Federal grant dollars, 
particularly given how dynamic the 
terrorism threat landscape is today. 
It directs DHS to develop a plan for 
how to support the transition of costs 
associated with maintaining homeland 
security 
core 
capabilities 
achieved 
through UASI investments. 
Specifically, my bill would direct 
DHS, acting through FEMA, to survey 
current and former UASI cities regard-
ing 
their 
capabilities 
that 
were 
achieved through UASI grant funding 
that are at risk of being reduced or 
eliminated without Federal assistance. 
Additionally, the bill would require 
DHS, if needed, to submit a plan on 
how to make Federal assistance avail-
able to former UASI jurisdictions to 
take on the costs of preserving UASI- 
funded homeland security capabilities, 
including legislation. 
This plan is the first step to ensure 
that all cities have the capabilities 
they need to secure themselves from 
terrorist threats. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my House 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5615, the Homeland Secu-
rity Capabilities Preservation Act. 
The DHS Urban Area Security Initia-
tive provides critical funding to high- 
risk urban areas. Since UASI funding is 
risk-based, there are urban areas that 
develop and support certain counter-
terrorism capabilities using the grant 
funding but don’t remain on the high- 
risk list and therefore don’t consist-
ently receive funding every year. 
This legislation simply directs the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to 
submit to Congress a plan to make 
Federal assistance available for at 
least 3 consecutive fiscal years to cer-
tain urban areas that did not receive 
funding under UASI. 
This plan will inform Congress about 
the needs and concerns of certain 
urban areas that may not consistently 
receive such funding. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 5615, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5615 is the first 
step in ensuring that cities that fall on 
and off the UASI list will have the op-
portunity to preserve their capabilities 
that were built out with the funding 
provided by the program. 
Enacting H.R. 5615 is timelier now 
more than ever, particularly given how 
dynamic the terrorist threat landscape 
is today. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
5615, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
DEMINGS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5615. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 5616, the 
DHS Basic Training Accreditation Im-
provement Act of 2021. 
Every year, DHS onboards thousands 
of new officers who all must success-
fully complete basic law enforcement 
training programs. 
As a former police chief with 27 years 
of law enforcement service, I have seen 
how training saves lives. 
Unfortunately, at DHS, several of the 
basic training programs tailored to 
component officers are not accredited. 
In some cases, programs have been 
unaccredited for several years. 
Unaccredited programs include: the 
U.S. Border Patrol Academy, the Cus-
toms and Border Protections’ Field Op-
erations Academy Officer Basic Train-
ing program, and the U.S. Citizenship 
and 
Immigration 
Services’ 
Officer 
Basic Training program. 
In 2019, the head of the Department’s 
Federal Law Enforcement Training 
Centers testified before the Homeland 
Security Committee that accreditation 
is important because it ‘‘assigns rigor 
to training processes’’ and ‘‘results in 
the best product.’’ 
H.R. 5616 seeks to improve the qual-
ity of the training provided to all new 
DHS officers. 
It does this by requiring the Depart-
ment to report to Congress on the ac-
creditation status of each of its basic 
training programs. 
For those programs that are not ac-
credited, it requires DHS to report: the 
reasons for not obtaining or maintain-
ing accreditation; the activities, if any, 
taken to achieve accreditation; and the 
anticipated timeline for accreditation 
of the program. 
Further, H.R. 5616 requires DHS to 
continue to report to Congress annu-
ally until all DHS basic training pro-
grams are accredited. 
H.R. 5616 also directs DHS to engage 
in research to help State, local, Tribal, 
and territorial law enforcement offi-
cers better access the Federal Law En-
forcement Training Center training op-
portunities, including those that en-
hance national preparedness and re-
sponse to terrorism. 
I introduced this bill in October to 
direct DHS to prioritize improving its 
basic training programs to maintain a 
higher standard of excellence for new 
officers and position them to effec-
tively safeguard the American people, 
our homeland, and institutions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my House 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5616, the DHS Basic Train-
ing Accreditation Improvement Act of 
2021. 
This legislation requires the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to report 
to Congress on an annual basis on the 
accreditation status for each basic 
training program within the Depart-
ment. It also requires congressional no-
tification within 30 days of a lapse of 
accreditation for any Department basic 
training program. 
This legislation will help bring need-
ed congressional oversight to DHS 
basic training programs by ensuring 
that DHS is transparent about any ac-
creditation shortcomings and properly 
addresses them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge members to 
join me in supporting H.R. 5616, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
have no more speakers, I am prepared 
to close, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I urge 
Members to support this bill, I think it 
is a good bill, and I commend my friend 
for bringing it to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, our top priority, as 
Members of Congress, is protecting the 
safety and security of the American 
people. 
We have no room for error when it 
comes to keeping Americans safe. 
H.R. 5616 prioritizes the quality of 
training DHS offers its newest officers 
and ensures that State, local, and Trib-
al law enforcement entities have better 
access to trainings that will make 
American communities safer. 
I thank my colleagues on the Home-
land Security Committee for unani-
mously supporting H.R. 5616. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the rest of 
my colleagues to support H.R. 5616, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
DEMINGS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5616, as 
amended.

SHADOW WOLVES ENHANCEMENT 
ACT 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5681) to authorize the reclas-
sification of the tactical enforcement 
officers 
(commonly 
known 
as 
the 
‘‘Shadow Wolves’’) in the Homeland Se-
curity Investigations tactical patrol 
unit operating on the lands of the 
Tohono O’odham Nation as special 
agents, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5681 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Shadow 
Wolves Enhancement Act’’. 
SEC. 2. RECLASSIFICATION OF SHADOW WOLVES 
AS GS–1811 SPECIAL AGENTS. 
The Director of U.S. Immigration and Cus-
toms Enforcement is authorized— 
(1) to reclassify the GS–1801 tactical en-
forcement officers (commonly known as 
‘‘Shadow Wolves’’) assigned to the Homeland 
Security Investigations tactical patrol unit 
operating on the lands of the Tohono 
O’odham Nation, as of the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, as GS–1811 special agents, 
upon the successful completion of— 
(A) the Federal Law Enforcement Training 
Center’s Criminal Investigator Training Pro-
gram; and 
(B)(i) Customs Basic Enforcement School, 
if the officer was hired before March 2003; or 
(ii) U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement Homeland Security Investigations 
Special Agent Training, if the officer was 
hired during or after March 2003; 
(2) to classify any Shadow Wolves who are 
assigned to the unit referred to in paragraph 
(1) after such date of enactment as GS–1811 
special agents upon the successful comple-
tion of the training described in paragraph 
(1); and 
(3) to classify as GS–1811 special agents 
upon the successful completion of the train-
ing described in paragraph (1) any Shadow 
Wolves who are hired as part of a comparable 
unit (regardless of location) established after 
such date of enactment with the approval 
and consent of the appropriate Indian tribe. 
SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF SHADOW WOLVES PRO-
GRAM. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall submit to the 
Comptroller General of the United States, 
the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the 
Committee on Homeland Security of the 
House of Representatives a strategy for— 
(1) retaining existing Shadow Wolves; 
(2) recruiting new Shadow Wolves; and 
(3) expanding comparable units referred to 
in section 2(3) to appropriate areas near the 
international border between the United 
States and Canada or the international bor-
der between the United States and Mexico, 
with the approval and consent of the appro-
priate Indian tribe. 
SEC. 4. GAO REPORT. 
Not later than 1 year after receiving the 
strategy required under section 3 and annu-
ally thereafter for the following two years, 
the Comptroller General of the United States 
shall submit to the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs of the 
Senate and the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity of the House of Representatives— 
(1) an assessment of the effectiveness of 
such strategy; and 
(2) any recommendations for improve-
ments to the strategy that the Comptroller 
General determines to be appropriate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 5681, the Shadow Wolves 
Enhancement Act. 
This bipartisan legislation, sponsored 
by the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
KATKO), the ranking member of the 
Homeland Security Committee, seeks 
to resolve limitations to career ad-
vancement and pay equity for Native 
American officers, a part of the Shad-
ow Wolves program. 
Shadow Wolves are officers that form 
ICE Homeland Security Investigations’ 
tactical patrol unit. These officers op-
erate in the Tohono O’odham Nation, 
located in southern Arizona, and track 
human and drug smugglers along Trib-
al lands. 
Since 1974, the Tohono O’odham Na-
tion has allowed Shadow Wolves to pa-
trol its lands to stem the flow of illicit 
activity within the region. This elite 
unit leverages both technology and the 
traditional art of tracking to detect 
footprints, tire tracks, and clothing as-
sociated with smuggling operations. 
Over the last few years, Shadow 
Wolves 
have 
increasingly 
expanded 
their operation beyond tracking to in-
vestigative work and support response. 
Under current law, Shadow Wolves 
can only be hired as tactical officers in 
a lower pay grade, although most of 
the officers have completed special 
agent training. 
H.R. 5681 reclassifies Shadow Wolves 
as special agents upon successfully 
completing the law enforcement train-
ing requirements. H.R. 5681 also directs 
DHS to establish a strategy for pre-
serving the Shadow Wolves and expand-
ing comparable units with the consent 
of relevant Native American Tribes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1311 
March 7, 2022 
By passing this bipartisan bill today, 
this body is prioritizing the develop-
ment of a diverse and equitable Federal 
workforce. I urge my colleagues to join 
with the Tohono O’odham Nation and 
the Shadow Wolves officers and support 
H.R. 5681. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 5681, the Shadow 
Wolves Enhancement Act. 
This bill authorizes adjustments to 
the job classifications of officers as-
signed to the Homeland Security Inves-
tigations unit operating in the Tohono 
O’odham Nation, also known as the 
Shadow Wolves. 
The Shadow Wolves are the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s only 
tracking unit that is entirely composed 
of Native Americans. The Shadow 
Wolves were established by congres-
sional mandate in 1974 to combat ramp-
ant smuggling that was occurring from 
Mexico into the United States through 
the Tohono O’odham Nation. 
For the past 40 years, the Shadow 
Wolves have been patrolling a 76-mile 
stretch of the border, utilizing a com-
bination of high-tech equipment and 
the traditional art of tracking passed 
down from generation to generation on 
the Nation. 
The Shadow Wolves take their name 
from the way the unit operates, like a 
wolf pack, relying mostly on their abil-
ity to track. They use a technique 
called cutting for sign, which closely 
observes and analyzes any physical evi-
dence left by smugglers. I was fortu-
nate enough to personally observe this 
impressive technique during my visit 
to Arizona last year. 
The Shadow Wolves’ professionalism, 
skill, dedication, and presence have 
proven critical for border security and 
are essential in building Tribal stake-
holder trust and engagement. 
And for an elite unit, their oper-
ations couldn’t be more impressive. Be-
tween 2010 and 2020, Shadow Wolves’ ef-
forts led to 437 criminal arrests, and 
the seizure of over 117,000 pounds of 
narcotics, 45 weapons, 251 vehicles, and 
over $800,000 in U.S. currency. 
In recent years, the Shadow Wolves’ 
mission has evolved from tracking into 
more 
investigative 
work. 
Unfortu-
nately, the current hiring authority for 
the Shadow Wolves’ program does not 
allow current Shadow Wolves to be re-
classified at the appropriate level for 
investigative work, even if they have 
all the prerequisite experience. 
Further, this lack of authority has 
led to pay inequities and limited up-
ward mobility for current Shadow 
Wolves officers. Without the passage of 
this critical legislation, the entire 
Shadow Wolves program is at risk of 
becoming nonoperational as current of-
ficers retire. 
My bill, the Shadow Wolves Enhance-
ment 
Act, 
allows 
current 
Shadow 
Wolves to be reclassified as GS–1811 
special agents upon the successful com-
pletion of training. It also addresses 
pay equity for current Shadow Wolves 
and allows new Native American appli-
cants to be added to the unit. 
This bill also requires the Secretary 
of Homeland Security to develop a 
strategy to retain existing Shadow 
Wolves and expand comparable units 
along the international land borders 
both north and south of our country 
with the approval of appropriate Tribal 
governments. 
Every day, the Shadow Wolves carry 
out a difficult and dangerous mission 
under 
increasingly 
challenging 
cir-
cumstances. Every day, they report for 
duty and help secure the border across 
arduous desert terrain and rugged 
mountainous areas. 
Today is the day that we in Congress 
honor their efforts and modernize the 
Shadow Wolves program. Passage of 
this legislation will provide long-term 
viability for a truly unique and nec-
essary border security program and a 
pathway for future Native American 
applicants. 
This act has strong bipartisan sup-
port in the House and the Senate, as 
well as support from the Department of 
Homeland Security and, of course, the 
Tohono O’odham Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a resolution from the Tohono 
O’odham Nation Legislative Council in 
support of the Shadow Wolves En-
hancement Act. 
RESOLUTION OF THE TOHONO O’ODHAM 
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 
SUPPORTING FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO RECLAS-
SIFY
HOMELAND
SECURITY
INVESTIGATIONS 
TACTICAL
OFFICERS ‘‘SHADOW
WOLVES’’ AS 
SPECIAL AGENTS 
Whereas, the Constitution of the Tohono 
O’odham Nation vests the Legislative Coun-
cil with the authority to ‘‘promote, protect 
and provide for public health, peace, morals, 
education and general welfare of the Tohono 
O’odham Nation and its members’’ and to 
‘‘consult with the Congress of the United 
States and appropriate federal agencies re-
garding federal activities that affect the 
Tohono O’odham Nation . . .’’ (Constitution, 
Article VI, Section 1(c)(2) and Section 1(j)); 
and 
Whereas, the Tohono O’odham Nation 
(‘‘Nation’’) is a federally recognized Indian 
tribe located on approximately 4,500 square 
miles in southern Arizona, with approxi-
mately 65 miles of its border on the Inter-
national Boundary with Mexico; and 
Whereas, over many years, the Nation has 
cooperated with the U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection to stem the flow of narcotics 
and undocumented immigrants while main-
taining the Nation’s opposition to a physical 
wall (Resolution No. 17–053); and 
Whereas, since 1974, the Nation has allowed 
the U.S. Customs Service to staff a facility 
in Sells, and in return the U.S. Customs 
Service employed up to 25 Native Americans 
as Customs Patrol Officers; and 
Whereas, around 1985, the U.S. Customs 
Service organized these Native American 
Customs Patrol Officers into a select unit 
which came to be known as the ‘‘Shadow 
Wolves,’’ which utilized the unique knowl-
edge and skill of Native Americans to track 
and interdict smugglers crossing the lands of 
the Nation; and 
Whereas, the Shadow Wolves have gained 
an international reputation as a small but 
highly effective interdiction unit of the U.S. 
Customs Service; and 
Whereas, U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema is 
proposing a bill to authorize the Director of 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
to reclassify the members of the Shadow 
Wolves unit from tactical officers to special 
agents; and 
Whereas, this reclassification could im-
prove the pay scale for Shadow Wolves, im-
prove their ability to enforce immigration 
and customs laws, and better investigate and 
track cross-border illegal activity; and 
Whereas, the Nation’s chairperson, Border 
Security Delegation, Appropriations and Do-
mestic Affairs Committees have reviewed 
the legislation and recommend support. 
Now, therefore, be it Resolved that the 
Tohono O’odham Legislative Council sup-
ports federal legislation to reclassify Home-
land Security Investigations Tactical Offi-
cers ‘‘Shadow Wolves’’ as special agents. 
The foregoing Resolution was passed by 
the Tohono O’odham Legislative Council on 
the 06th day of MARCH, 2020 at a meeting at 
which a quorum was present with a vote of 
3,175.7 FOR; -0- AGAINST; -0- NOT VOTING; 
and [02] ABSENT, pursuant to the powers 
vested in the Council by Article VI, Section 
l(c)(2) and (j) of the Constitution of the 
Tohono O’odham Nation, adopted by the 
Tohono O’odham Nation on January 18, 1986; 
and approved by the Acting Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary—Indian Affairs (Operations) 
on March 6, 1986, pursuant to Section 16 of 
the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat.984).

EVONNE WILSON, 
Legislative Secretary. 
Mr. 
KATKO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
strongly urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support this crit-
ical legislation in support of our Native 
American friends and partners. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
H.R. 5681 is about enhancing equity 
and career opportunities for Native 
American officers that currently serve 
as Shadow Wolves in Sells, Arizona. 
These officers are currently limited 
in pay and opportunity by their classi-
fication, despite having the appro-
priate training for advancement. This 
legislation addresses that problem.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO)

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, now more than ever 
it is critical that State and local gov-
ernments, along with the private sec-
tor, prioritize their cybersecurity pre-
paredness. The threat of cyberattacks 
continues to grow, and with the ongo-
ing Russian invasion of Ukraine, we 
are reminded yet again of the impor-
tance of stronger cybersecurity. 
Since 2004, DHS has partnered with 
the National Cybersecurity Prepared-
ness Consortium, a group of univer-
sities that conduct research and train-
ing to help entities better prepare for 
cyber risks. This legislation will au-
thorize 
the 
consortium 
to 
help 
strengthen our Nation’s cybersecurity 
preparedness. 
More specifically, S. 658 authorizes 
DHS to partner with a consortium of 
nonprofit entities to provide training 
to first responders, develop curricu-
lums for training programs, conduct 
cross-sector exercises to defend and re-
spond to cyber threats, and help incor-
porate cyber risk into State and local 
emergency plans. 
Last year, Congress provided $1 bil-
lion in new grants to State and local 
governments to strengthen their cyber-
security. Ensuring they have access to 
advice and support to develop their cy-
bersecurity preparedness plans is an 
additional step we can take to enhance 
our Nation’s cybersecurity. 
Additionally, 
Chairman 
THOMPSON 
offered an amendment during the com-
mittee markup that strengthened the 
bill by ensuring that DHS can partner 
with more than one consortium; adding 
the inclusion of HBCUs, MSIs, and 
community colleges as a factor in the 
selection of a consortium; and pro-
moting greater geographic diversity 
among participating institutions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1313 
March 7, 2022 
All communities across the Nation 
need to prioritize cybersecurity pre-
paredness. These changes should ensure 
that DHS partners with a diverse range 
of institutions to better assist the 
many different types of State and local 
governments that would benefit from 
enhanced cybersecurity preparedness. 
I thank Senators Cornyn and Leahy 
for their leadership in authorizing this 
legislation and for working with the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee 
to 
make improvements to this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my House 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of S. 658, the 
National Cybersecurity Preparedness 
Consortium Act. This bill authorizes 
the Department of Homeland Security 
to work with the National Cybersecu-
rity Preparedness Consortium to help 
prepare for and respond to cybersecu-
rity risks at the national, State, and 
local levels. 
I applaud Senator CORNYN
for his 
steadfast dedication to this most im-
portant piece of legislation. Now more 
than ever, our State and local commu-
nities must be prepared to prevent, de-
tect, and mitigate cyber threats. Un-
fortunately, many of us have had con-
stituent businesses, schools, and hos-
pitals, among others, that have been 
impacted by persistent and evolving 
cyber threats. 
This legislation will help provide 
training, exercises, technical assist-
ance, and other important resources to 
State and local governments, critical 
infrastructure, and industry partners. 
I thank Senator CORNYN for his work 
on this important bill. I urge Members 
to join me in supporting S. 658, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the best time to 
prioritize cybersecurity is before you 
experience a cyber incident. Cybersecu-
rity preparedness is essential, yet most 
State and local governments do not 
have the experience, expertise, or re-
sources to do it alone. They need a 
Federal partner. 
Enactment of S. 658 delivers on that 
partnership through a network of con-
sortiums across the country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support S. 658, as amended, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
DEMINGS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 658, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

proximately 6:30 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 4 o’clock and 29 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

garding accreditation of basic training

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 6181 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I hereby remove my name as cosponsor 
of H.R. 6181. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). The gentlewoman’s request 
is accepted. 
f 
ENHANCING SOCIAL SECURITY 
(Mr. LARSON of Connecticut asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I am here to commend Chair-
man NEAL and the Racial Equity Ini-
tiative headed by TERRI SEWELL, STEVE 
HORSFORD, and JIMMY GOMEZ, and also 
to recognize JOYCE
BEATTY, for the 
work that they have done in bringing 
forward the inequity that has existed 
in this country for far too long. 
More than 5 million of our fellow 
Americans 
get 
below 
poverty-level 
checks from Social Security because 
the Congress of the United States has 
not done anything to enhance Social 
Security in more than 50 years. 
Whom does that affect the most? It 
affects women of color and women spe-
cifically—people who held jobs who 
weren’t earning the same kind of sal-
ary or wages and people who were care-
givers at home for their children. 
Help is on the way. Social Security 
2100 is coming to the floor, and finally, 
millions of Americans who get below 
poverty-level 
checks 
after 
having 
worked all their lives and paid into a 
system are going to get what they rich-
ly deserve. 
f 
AMERICA DESERVES ENERGY 
FREEDOM 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the 
American people are asking one simple 
question: Why does the Biden adminis-
tration hate energy freedom in Amer-
ica? 
They have asked that question every 
time they have gone to the gas station 
and seen prices skyrocketing. Now, 
they are asking that question as this 
administration is falling to its knees 
and begging Iran for a nuclear deal. 
Sacrificing our geopolitical leverage by 
appealing to our enemies is appalling, 
and it is the last thing that should ever 
be considered. 
Madam Speaker, this administration 
would rather be awarded a participa-
tion trophy than dig in and fight to put 
American interests first. 
That mentality is bankrupting our 
great country, and we have been led 
into a political minefield. It is a dis-
play of pure weakness and an absolute 
disgrace. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
INGEBORG HEUSER 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor the life of Ingeborg Heuser, who 
passed away after a lifetime in the 
arts. 
Ingeborg immigrated to the United 
States from Germany after World War 
II, arriving to El Paso in 1953 as the 
wife of a servicemember. 
As a classical ballet dancer, she 
opened her first studio that year and 
became ballet director of the Texas 
Western Civic Ballet. Over the next 47 
years, she would establish and direct 
Ballet El Paso, Ballet of the Americas, 
and the University of Texas El Paso 
ballet. Thousands of students passed 
through her studio doors, and countless 
audience members were exposed to a 
wide range of classical ballet through 
her service. 
Her cross-border collaborations with 
companies in Europe, Mexico, and 
Latin America contributed to the ex-
change of international artistic en-
deavors, including the first U.S.-Mex-
ico repertory exchange in 1977. 
Madam Speaker, we have lost one of 
El Paso’s shining stars, a trailblazer of 
the arts for our region. I ask you to 
join me in paying tribute to the life of 
Ingeborg Heuser. May her legacy and 
commitment to the arts continue to be 
an inspiration to us all. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOEL 
WILLIAMS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor the life of Joel Williams. 
Joel was born December 19, 1942, in 
the family farm kitchen in Dacula, 
Georgia. Unlike many children now-
adays, Joel grew up without electricity 
and indoor plumbing, learning to read 
by kerosene lamps. 
His drive and determination revealed 
themselves early as he earned valedic-
torian honors at Dacula High School 
and graduated magna cum laude from 
Shorter College. He then went on to at-
tend Walter F. George School of Law at 
Mercer University where he was the 
first honor graduate of the class of 
1967. 
Joel began his legal career as an as-
sistant attorney general of the State of 
Georgia under Arthur K. Bolton. He 
then left Washington for Savannah in 
1971 to become vice president and chief 
compliance officer for Savannah Foods 
and Industries. During this time, he 
met his wife of 25 years, M’Liss Gurney 
Williams, and had two beautiful daugh-
ters. 
Joel committed his life to political 
and community service. Through all of 
his achievements, Joel was most proud 
of his daughters and grandchildren. 
Joel was a loving and devoted father. 
The children he raised and grand-
children he loved will forever remem-
ber the man Joel was throughout his 
life. 
f 
b 1930 
UKRAINE NEEDS OUR HELP 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
tonight to call attention to the con-
tinuing horror being unleashed in 
Ukraine by the treacherous tyrant 
Vladimir Putin, a pitiful creature of 
darkness. 
Forty-four 
million 
freedom-loving 
Ukrainians deserve to live in peace and 
freedom. They voted for liberty, 90 per-
cent of them. They have done nothing 
to Putin. They pose no threat to Rus-
sia. 
Putin invaded a sovereign nation and 
is committing war crimes against civil-
ians. He is creating a humanitarian cri-
sis flooding across Europe. The trains 
aren’t big enough to haul all of the 
people seeking peace. 
In the 11 days since he invaded, and 
since 2014, he has murdered hundreds of 
Ukrainians, in addition to the 14,000 
Russians killed in Ukraine, and over 1.5 
million have fled across the border into 
neighboring countries. 
The American people are opening 
their hearts with humanitarian aid, 
but the free world must help provide 
more fighter jets, Javelins, Stingers, 
small arms, ammunition, body armor, 
and air defense. 
Ukraine is the scrimmage line for 
liberty in Europe. Here, at the begin-
ning of the 21st century, liberty re-
quires vigilance for Ukraine. 
f 
CONGRATULATING KENNETH 
BURKETT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate Kenneth Burkett, a Jefferson 
County resident, for receiving the 
Crabtree Award from the Society for 
American Archaeology. 
This award is given annually to an 
outstanding avocational archaeologist 
in remembrance of Don Crabtree. Mr. 
Crabtree brought experimental archae-
ology to prominence. 
Recipients of the Crabtree Award are 
archaeologists who have contributed to 
advance the understanding of local, re-
gional, 
and 
national 
archaeology

through excavation, research, publica-
tion, site preservation, or collections 
preservation, all in collaboration with 
the professional community or public 
outreach. 
This award is well deserved for Ken-
neth, as he has spent his career con-
ducting archaeological research and 
excavations in western Pennsylvania, 
focusing on the lifeways of prehistoric 
Native Americans who once lived in 
the Redbank Creek watershed. 
Kenneth is currently the executive 
director of the Jefferson County His-
tory Center as well as a field associate 
with the Carnegie Museum of Natural 
History. He spends time working close-
ly with the Society for Pennsylvania 
Archaeology 29th Chapter, located in 
North Fork. 
Kenneth has a true passion for bring-
ing our history to life and sharing the 
artifacts of the people who walked this 
Earth before us. 
Once again, I want to congratulate 
Kenneth on this well-deserved accom-
plishment.

RECOGNIZING 
WGY 
RADIO 
STA-
TION 
ON 
ITS 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize New York’s Capital 
Region radio station, WGY, on the oc-
casion of its 100th anniversary. 
Through decades of informing and en-
tertaining Capital Region listeners, 
WGY has long stood as a pillar of the 
Schenectady community. 
This pioneering station, established 
by engineers at General Electric in 
1922, has spent a century at the fore-
front of innovations in radio tech-
nology. 
From conducting the first two-way 
radio transmission to England to being 
one of the first two radio stations to 
broadcast baseball’s World Series, WGY 
has played a key role in establishing 
New York’s Capital District as a global 
and national hub for technological ad-
vancement. 
I extend my warm congratulations to 
everyone at WGY for reaching this his-
toric milestone. Throughout its first 
100 years, the station has connected 
with listeners through its talented and 
revered hosts. 
Here is to many more successful 
years delivering powerful stories and 
quality news to our communities. Con-
gratulations to WGY. 
f 
PUTIN’S WAR ATROCITIES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
murderous 
Putin’s war on Ukraine is criminal. 
I am grateful that America and our 
NATO allies are unified to support 
Ukraine 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelensky and the Ukrainian people. 
I have faith in the Russian people, 
who I have met on numerous visits 
across Russia, that they will reject 
Putin’s war atrocities. A nation of 
world-significant art, music, and lit-
erature can change, and that is why I 
am introducing a bill to encourage 
Russian military defectors with imme-
diate refugee status in America, with 
up to $100,000 for any Russian military 
equipment 
transferred 
to 
Ukraine. 
Putin betrays the troops to death. 
Additionally, I will introduce a bill 
for a bust of President Volodymyr 
Zelensky to be placed in the U.S. Cap-
itol, as is the bust of Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill. Churchill was the 
wartime leader of World War II, and 
Zelensky is the wartime leader in

RECOGNIZING SANDRA NOE 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great respect and admiration that 
I rise to celebrate Women’s History 
Month and recognize Sandra Noe, Exec-
utive Director of Meals on Wheels in 
northwest Indiana. 
Sandra has worked with Meals on 
Wheels for 36 years to combat senior 
isolation and hunger. 
As the demand for services increased 
over the past year during the COVID–19 
pandemic, Meals on Wheels rose to the 
challenge 
and 
delivered 
over 
1,700 
meals 
daily, 
provided 
over 
750,000 
wellness checks, and celebrated its 
nine-millionth delivery. 
Madam Speaker, as we recognize 
Women’s History Month, please join 
me in thanking Sandra and everyone at 
Meals on Wheels for the extraordinary 
services they provide to northwest In-
diana. 
Let us recommit to continuing to 
support their invaluable work and rec-
ognize this month and every day the 
invaluable ways that women continue 
to provide healing and promote hope, 
not just in caregiving, but in all as-
pects of our society.

BIDEN’S ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, this past 
weekend, on my way to a military 
medal presentation in Crossville, Ten-
nessee, I stopped to fill my SUV with 
gas. Like many Americans, I was 
shocked to have to pay nearly $4 a gal-
lon for gasoline. 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has no 
doubt made this situation worse, but 
our skyrocketing gas prices are pri-
marily due to President Biden’s rever-
sal of President Trump’s highly suc-
cessful energy policies that had oil and 
gas production high, gas pump prices 
low, had created hundreds of thousands 
of new energy jobs, and had created an 
energy-independent United States for 
the first time in decades. 
Instead of admitting this mistake, 
ending the freeze on new oil and gas 
projects, and stopping the regulatory 
assault on new energy projects in the 
United States, the Biden administra-
tion has reportedly been secretly meet-
ing with Venezuela and its corrupt au-
thoritarian regime to discuss the pos-
sible lifting of sanctions against im-
porting Venezuelan oil. 
We currently purchase more than 
half a million barrels of oil a day from 
Russia, which needs to stop imme-
diately. Instead of replacing Russian 
oil with equally nefarious Venezuelan 
oil, why not re-create those jobs here 
in America.

HONORING CANDICE EBERHARDT 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Candice 
Eberhardt, who recently made history 
by becoming the first Black woman to 
lead the Akron-Cleveland Association 
of Realtors, also known as ACAR, 
across its 100-year existence. 
Throughout her 20 years in realty, 
Ms. Eberhardt has held many titles: 
youngest minority real estate broker 
in Akron, emerging leader, and entre-
preneur. Now, she adds one more: glass 
ceiling breaker. 
I am most grateful for the ways Ms. 
Eberhardt gives back to our commu-
nity. She helps to develop young 
agents. She speaks to community 
groups about homeownership. She has 
held key roles in local government. 
She serves as the Akron NAACP hous-
ing chair, and she mentors high school 
students. 
Through her impressive career and 
considerable 
contributions, 
Ms. 
Eberhardt has paved a path that more 
Black women in northeast Ohio will 
follow. I would like to congratulate Ms. 
Eberhardt on her new role and thank 
her for serving as a trailblazer, a 
change-maker, and a role model in 
northeast Ohio.

CALIFORNIA’S HIGH GAS PRICES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, the national average for a gal-
lon of gas is a little over $4—$4.06 to be 
exact. Meanwhile, in my home State of 
California, the average gas price per 
gallon all across our State is $5.34. For 
the first time ever, the average gas 
price per gallon is over $5 in every sin-
gle California county. 
Now, I know California brings a lot of 
pain upon itself, self-inflicted, but I

have seen a lot of the mainstream 
media try to claim that these price in-
creases are due to Russia’s attack on 
Ukraine, not the Biden administra-
tion’s anti-energy agenda. If that were 
true, how has the gas price per gallon 
increased by $1.60 over the last year, 
not just the last two weeks of the 
Ukraine conflict. 
Since taking office, the Biden admin-
istration has frozen all new oil and gas 
projects on Federal lands and imple-
mented extreme financial barriers on 
domestic oil and gas production. On 
day one, of course, we all know he 
killed the Keystone pipeline, which 
could be supplying 830,000 barrels of oil 
from Canada to U.S. refineries, more 
than what Russia imports to us. 
In his first week, we had an executive 
order stopping new leases on Federal 
lands, so we need to replace Russian 
energy with our own production. 
f 
STANDING AGAINST ANTI- 
SEMITISM 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to stand in solidarity with Con-
gregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, 
Texas, and stand against anti-Semi-
tism and other forms of religious big-
otry. 
On January 15 of this year, Congrega-
tion Beth Israel, in our North Texas 
area, endured a preplanned terrorist at-
tack with the explicit purpose of tar-
geting Jews. 
This attack was personal to me, be-
cause I know the rabbi of that con-
gregation, Charlie Cytron-Walker, and 
his wife, Adena, very well. I met them 
when they first moved to the North 
Texas area. 
That is why I am here today, because 
no community should have to endure 
that type of attack while they are try-
ing to worship. It doesn’t matter what 
religion they happen to be. It has abso-
lutely no place in our houses of wor-
ship. 
Tomorrow, in the House, we will vote 
on a bipartisan resolution that my fel-
low colleague from North Texas, BETH 
VAN DUYNE, and I are leading. This res-
olution condemns the actions taken in 
Colleyville in January and underscores 
our commitment to fighting anti-Semi-
tism. I ask everybody to support it, be-
cause we must root out hate.

RACIAL DISPARITIES IN 
HEALTHCARE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to co-anchor this Con-
gressional Black Caucus Special Order 
and to be joined by my co-anchor, the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York, Congressman TORRES. I thank 
him so very much for his presence here 
today. 
Let me acknowledge the chair of the 
Congressional Black Caucus as well 
and thank her for helping to organize 
this Special Order as well as to be able 
to discuss health equity and the Black 
family and the reasons why the CBC 
strongly urges and supports substantial 
investments for healthcare in the budg-
et for fiscal year 2023. I also want to es-
pecially acknowledge my friend and 
colleague, 
the 
Honorable 
DONALD 
PAYNE, whose office initiative has al-
ways focused us on the enormity of 
health disparities in the African-Amer-
ican community. 
Let me start with a few comments to 
be made regarding the work of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. Let me ac-
knowledge and express my appreciation 
to the President of the United States 
for hosting the members of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus this afternoon 
who serve on the executive committee 
and for the concern and interest that 
the President has expressed on a num-
ber of issues that I think are important 
to where we are today in America. 
Let me borrow this picture from Con-
gresswoman KAPTUR, who heads the 
Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, and 
just remind everyone, because the Con-
gressional Black Caucus has been at 
the forefront of persons fleeing perse-
cution. 
b 1945 
We have been a leader. Whether it is 
Haiti or whether it is places in Africa 
or the Caribbean or Europe, African 
Americans have been at the forefront. 
This happens to be the mass of people 
that are trying to escape Ukraine be-
cause of the bloody and immoral and 
purposeless and vicious and vile ac-
tions of Vladimir Putin. 
We stand here today as well, recog-
nizing the humanitarian crisis and rec-
ognizing as well that we, as Americans, 
are going to be supporting any people 
who are fighting for democracy. As we 
fight for those people, we will also rec-
ognize that we will ensure that we are 
protecting democracy and the freedom 
of all people. 
With that in mind, we had a number 
of issues that we discussed, and I think 
it is important that healthcare was 
certainly a part of it. And the dispari-
ties, disparities dealing with African- 
American boys and African-American 
men and recognize that we need to 
focus on eliminating those stark dis-
parities that would result in less of a 
future for these young boys, for their 
lives turning around even before they 
enter school, that there is an interven-
tion to ensure that they become the 
best of what they can be. That is a cru-
cial element of what we talked about 
as well. 
I am very grateful that we were also 
in discussions on H.R. 40, the Commis-
sion to Study and Develop Reparation 
Proposals for African Americans Act; 
and, of course, the very positive discus-
sion that we had, breaking news is that 
progress will be made on the idea of 
healing and repairing and reparations, 
and we are certainly grateful for that 
discussion. 
I would also like to mention as I 
begin, in the immediacy of the news of 
the day, we are well aware of my con-
stituent that is now being held in Rus-
sia, that is Brittney Griner, an Olym-
pian, a double-honors WNBA player. 
Unfortunately, we don’t have the proof 
of the allegations. We are disturbed, 
but we know that she has the possi-
bility of being held for 10 years because 
of the alleged charges that they are 
making against her. We are grateful to 
have had the opportunity to bring this 
to the attention of the President of the 
United States, and we expect that 
hopefully this situation will be looked 
at as closely as possible and that help 
will be coming. 
I mention this because our Chair-
woman has always said, Our Power, 
Our Message. We speak of a multitude 
of messages that we will have tonight, 
focused in particular on the issue of 
healthcare. 
As a member of the United States 
Congress and the Congressional Black 
Caucus, we can’t start this without 
talking about the COVID–19 pandemic 
that has laid bare for the Nation to see 
the stark racial and ethnic inequalities 
exacerbated by the virus. 
In my home State of Texas as of the 
end of September 2020, there had been 
more than 760,000 cases of COVID–19 
and 16,000 deaths. According to the 
Texas 
State 
Department 
of 
State 
healthcare services, 70 percent of the 
confirmed fatalities are people of color. 
In Texas, COVID–19 mortality rates 
are 30 percent higher for African Amer-
icans and 80 percent higher for His-
panics. One factor in the Hispanic and 
African-American 
populations 
being 
more likely to contract COVID–19 is 
employment in occupations associated 
with public contact that cannot be 
done remotely. 
We saw that in the early stages of 
COVID–19, when testing was not at its 
peak, that the numbers were so high in 
New York, New Orleans, Detroit, and, 
yes, in Houston, Texas, because African 
Americans, in particular, were in jobs 
that they had hands on, that they were 
encountering 
people, 
whether 
they 
were metro bus drivers or TSA workers 
in the Federal system, whether they 
were retailers in the grocery store, 
whether they were firefighters and first 
responders or police officers, we were 
finding out that they were being con-
fronted by these particular issues. 
The idea of health disparities in the 
African-American 
community 
lends 
itself to the very reason why this Spe-
cial Order is crucial. Health coverage 
as it relates to African Americans in 
2017: 
10.6 percent of African Americans 
were uninsured compared with 5.9 per-
cent of non-Hispanic Whites; 
89.4 percent of African Americans had 
healthcare coverage in 2017 compared 
with 93 percent of White Americans;

H1318 
March 7, 2022 
44.1 percent of African Americans had 
government health insurance coverage 
in 2017; and 
12.1 percent of African Americans 
under the age of 65 reported having no 
health insurance coverage. 
Chronic health conditions are preva-
lent in our community. 13.8 percent of 
African Americans reported having fair 
or poor health. We are prone to diabe-
tes; cancer, particularly breast cancer, 
prostate cancer, lung cancer, brain 
cancer; and the leading causes of death 
among African Americans are heart 
disease, cancer, and accidents. 
There are 11 infant deaths per 1,000 
births among Black Americans. This is 
almost twice the national average of 
5.8. Of course, we have a serious prob-
lem with Black maternal mortality, 
which I am very glad the Congressional 
Black Caucus has taken on as an im-
portant issue. 
I know that there are also the dif-
ferent kinds of cancer that impact Af-
rican-American males, and I know my 
colleagues will spend their time dis-
cussing that. 
I think the point that is most impor-
tant is that we realize that all of the 
indicia 
indicating 
disparities 
in 
healthcare unfortunately fall on Afri-
can Americans. 
One I forgot to mention is obesity. 
African-American 
women 
have 
the 
highest rates of obesity or being over-
weight compared to other groups in the 
United States, about four out of five 
African-American 
women 
are 
over-
weight or obese. 
As we have this discussion tonight, 
there are several things that I think we 
should be reminded of. Twelve States 
refused to take the expanded Medicaid 
when the Affordable Care Act was fi-
nalized and signed by the President of 
the United States. I was here; we were 
fighting. In fact, we had included ex-
panded Medicaid as a response to the 
public option, that we were fighting 
for. I was in support of the public op-
tion, but we compromised, and lo and 
behold, if I may use that terminology, 
didn’t it get taken out. Didn’t we have 
States refusing to accept expanded 
Medicaid, and they are in the worst 
dire straits which includes the State 
that is a poster child for uninsured, 
and that is the State of Texas. 
But in this Build Back Better Act, we 
created, with the work of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, a Federal Med-
icaid process that we could opt into so 
that whatever State you lived in—the 
12 horrific States that did not accept it 
who suffer every single day, not the 
States, not the State government, but 
the people suffer every day, the chil-
dren suffer every day—we provided this 
in Build Back Better. 
I was so excited because we were 
pushing and working and sending let-
ters saying you had to fix this issue of 
not having the expanded Medicaid. We 
were able to secure that, and here we 
are with Build Back Better stalled in 
the United States Senate, after we 
worked so hard to get a bill that has so 
many elements to it that deals with 
the disparities in healthcare. 
As I conclude, let me indicate that 
the idea of these disparities fall right 
into the umbrella of H.R. 40, the Com-
mission to Study Slavery and Develop 
Reparation 
Proposals 
for 
African 
Americans Act, but the idea is to track 
slavery and its trajectory to 2021, why 
these stark disparities in healthcare 
and education and science and housing 
and the criminal justice system. But 
healthcare is life or death, and we can 
see it in a glaring panorama of any 
community you go into, of hospitals 
that you go into, hospice that you are 
in, that you see this disproportionate 
proportion of African Americans who 
either 
did 
not 
have 
access 
to 
healthcare in the early stages of their 
disease or either suffered from diseases 
that were, in fact, inherited from fami-
lies down through the generations be-
cause of diet, living conditions, or lack 
thereof. 
We stand here today on the floor of 
the House to say it is imperative that 
we work together as Americans to find 
a way to provide an even playing field 
for all of our children, if it takes legis-
lation that focuses specifically on dis-
eases that we have, that falls on our 
shoulders. 
I am a breast cancer survivor, and I 
have introduced over the years triple- 
negative breast cancer legislation that 
I hope I will see in the next few months 
passing, for triple-negative breast can-
cer is more deadly in our African- 
American populations and Hispanic 
populations. I know the cancer clusters 
that are in the Fifth Ward, Texas, in 
my district, or Kashmere Gardens, be-
cause living in conditions where there 
are toxic chemicals that these people 
are breathing or they are eating them 
because they are in the soil that they 
plant their gardens in. 
Can you imagine, Madam Speaker? 
This is what we are confronting. That 
is why the Congressional Black Caucus 
rises on the floor today to be able to 
address these serious questions of 
health disparities, which I believe is at 
this time a crucial moment in history 
for us to speak about. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, and the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, I am pleased to co-an-
chor this Congressional Black Caucus Special 
Order with my colleague, the distinguished 
gentleman from New York, Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES. 
I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congress-
woman BEATTY of Ohio, for organizing this 
Special Order to discuss the health equity and 
the Black Family and the reasons why the 
CBC strongly urges and supports substantial 
investments for healthcare in the budget for 
FY 2023. 
Before I do, however, let me note for the 
record that today is March 7, the 57th anniver-
sary of ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ when hundreds of 
heroic souls risked their lives in Selma, Ala-
bama, for freedom and to secure the right to 
vote for all Americans. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, who were 
led by our beloved colleague, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brave 
and determined men and women, boys and 
girls, persons of all races and creeds, who 
loved their country so much that they were 
willing to risk their lives to make it better, and 
to bring it even closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the 
right to equal treatment under the law, and in 
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote. 
I am Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
of Texas, and I proudly hail from the great city 
of Houston, which has been on the front lines 
since the beginning of the COVID–19 pan-
demic and paid more than its share in death, 
heartbreak, and suffering, especially among 
communities and healthcare workers of color, 
but has also seen the best our nation has to 
give in the selfless and courageous service of 
black nurses who were among the very first to 
answer the call and have never left or re-
treated from the field of battle. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has laid bare for 
the nation to see the stark racial and ethnic in-
equalities exacerbated by the virus. 
In my home state of Texas, as of the end 
of September 2020, there have been more 
than 760,000 cases of COVID–19 and 16,000 
deaths. 
According to the Texas Department of State 
Health Care Services, 70 percent of the con-
firmed fatalities were people of color. 
In Texas, COVID–19 mortality rates are 30 
percent higher for African Americans and 80 
percent higher for Hispanics overall. 
The differences become much larger when 
accounting for age; for example, in the 25 to 
44-year-old age group, African American mor-
tality rates are more than four times higher 
than White rates, and the Hispanic rates are 
more than seven times higher. 
One factor in Hispanic and African American 
populations being more likely to contract 
COVID–19 is employment in occupations as-
sociated with public contact and that cannot 
be done remotely. 
The sad fact is that most workers in these 
occupations are less able to be absent from 
their job or to have paid time off. 
In Texas, people of color are more than 40 
percent of cashiers, retail salespersons, child 
care workers, licensed practical nurses, more 
than 50 percent of bus drivers and transit 
workers, medical and nursing assistants, per-
sonal care aides, and home health aides, and 
more than 60 percent of building cleaners and 
housekeepers. 
In addition, Hispanic and African American 
populations in Texas are less likely to have 
health insurance and to have a regular health 
care provider, so less likely to seek or receive 
early care for symptoms, especially in the first 
months of the epidemic. 
And African American and Hispanic popu-
lations are also more likely to have an under-
lying health condition that makes them more 
vulnerable to the effects of COVID–19. 
To respond and mitigate the devastation 
wrought by COVID–19 on Americans, and es-
pecially marginal and vulnerable communities 
of color, I have introduced H.R. 330, the ‘‘De-
livering Covid–19 Vaccinations to All Regions 
and Vulnerable Communities Act’’ or ‘‘COVID– 
19 Delivery Act,’’ which I invite all Members to 
join as sponsors. 
Under the COVID–19 Delivery Act, FEMA 
will be authorized and directed to lead the ef-
fort for vaccine delivery from the receipt from

manufacturing facilities to delivery to des-
ignated inoculation sites (hospital, clinic, doc-
tors’ offices, school, places of worship, com-
munity centers, parks, or neighborhood gath-
ering locations. 
The legislation directs FEMA to develop and 
deploy a fully staffed and resourced 24-7 ad-
vanced real-time tracking system that allows 
FEMA to monitor shipments of vaccine units 
that can provide end-to-end transparency on 
the temperature, real-time location, origin, and 
destination data, anticipated time of arrival, 
and report on changes and update recipients 
on the progress of their delivery and report on 
changes that may impact expected delivery or 
the viability of the vaccine while in transit. 
I see the disparities in the lives of so many 
of my constituents who suffer disproportion-
ately from medical conditions that make 
COVID–19 deadly. 
They work low wage or no wage jobs to 
make ends meet, and they have no health in-
surance and rely on community health centers 
or public health services for routine care. 
I call them friends and neighbors because 
they are that to me. 
That is why I strongly support CBC’s legisla-
tive agenda for the 117th Congress to address 
the many social justice and health equity 
issues that are related to how the COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
manifested 
and 
amplified 
healthcare racial disparities in our commu-
nities. 
Specifically, I support: 
1. Expanded access to testing for all essen-
tial workers. 
2. Setup a comprehensive vaccination cam-
paign targeting communities of color and en-
suring free vaccination for all. 
3. Expanded SNAP food benefits. 
4. Direct relief payments of $2,000 a month 
until the end of the pandemic. 
5. Continue rent and mortgage payment 
suspension. 
6. Cancellation of student loan debt as stu-
dents of color have the highest debt loads. 
I support legislation that will ensure that all 
essential workers have access to free PPE for 
the duration of the pandemic. 
I also support legislation to raise the min-
imum wage to $15 dollars an hour and to de-
velop and support legislation that promotes 
the ethnic, racial and gender diversification of 
the health care workforce aimed at increasing 
overall cultural competence. 
Most importantly, I support legislation like 
H.R. 40 that directly augments the underlying 
social determinants of health (e.g., socio-
economic factors, education, employment, 
housing) that historically have disproportion-
ately impacted black and other communities of 
color that have made them more vulnerable to 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, the CBC strongly supports 
comprehensive efforts to reduce maternal and 
infant mortality and its devastating effects. 
Maternal and infant mortality disproportion-
ately impacts the Black community in compari-
son to other communities and this is unaccept-
able. 
700 women die each year in the United 
States as a result of pregnancy or delivery 
complications. 
Black women are shown to have a dis-
proportionate fatality rate during pregnancy or 
within 42 days after giving birth. 
In 2018, the national maternal mortality rate 
was 17.4 deaths per 100,000 births in 2018, 
37.1 black women died per 100,000 births. 
Black infants have 2.3 times the infant mor-
tality rate as white infants. 
African American infants are 3.8 times as 
likely to die from complications related to low 
birthweight as compared to non-Hispanic white 
infants. 
Black infants are at three times greater risk 
of accidental death than are white babies, and 
at more than four times the risk of developing 
SIDS. 
For these reasons, I strongly support and 
am working for: 
1. President Biden’s Budget that proposes 
$31.9 million for the Program for Treatment for 
Pregnant and Postpartum women; 
2. legislation that will increase the diversity 
of the perinatal health care workforce; 
3. investment in digital tools like telehealth 
to improve maternal health outcomes, espe-
cially in underserved areas; and 
4. Establishment of an Office of Sexual and 
Reproductive Health & Wellbeing in the White 
House to align federal policies and programs 
so they promote sexual and reproductive 
health and wellbeing through a human rights, 
reproductive justice, and racial equity lens. 
The CBC supports comprehensive efforts to 
endorse actions to address the health effects 
of systemic racism, such as H.R. 379, Improv-
ing Social Determinants of Health Act of 2021, 
which will authorize the CDC to set up a pro-
gram to improve health outcomes and reduce 
health inequities by coordinating CDC social 
determinants of health (SDOH) activities and 
improve capacity of public health agencies 
and community organizations to address 
SDOHs. 
We also support the passage of legislation 
focused on ways to increase the diversity of 
the U.S. health care workforce (especially 
nurses, physicians, dentists, and mental health 
workers) to include enhanced tuition and stu-
dent loan repayment programs for those from 
Black communities and other communities of 
color. 
CBC supports as well the passage of legis-
lation to combat institutional racism in all gov-
ernmental health related agencies and pro-
grams. 
I am also the lead sponsor of legislation, 
H.R. 40, which will establish a commission on 
restorative justice to investigate the ramifica-
tions of reparations that includes the acknowl-
edgment of historic health related atrocities. 
I support comprehensive efforts to ensure 
action to improve urban green spaces, public 
health, environmental health justice and global 
warming and support clean air/water protec-
tions and initiatives that ensure healthy envi-
ronments for all people because the most re-
cent data reveal that people of color compared 
to their white counterparts are disproportion-
ately affected by poor socio-ecosystems that 
affect their physical, mental and social well- 
being. 
Poor socio-ecosystem services translate to 
disparities in health risks so innovative and 
multifaceted strategies aimed at reversing the 
following issues are critical to improve the 
health and well-being of all Americans and 
specifically people of color. 
The CBC supports comprehensive efforts to 
reduce cancer inequities and its devastating 
effects. 
According to the American Cancer Society, 
Blacks have the highest mortality and poorest 
survival rate of any racial—ethnic group in the 
U.S. 
Experts are concerned that the COVID–19 
pandemic will exacerbate disparities in cancer 
care among Blacks, Hispanics, and other peo-
ple of color. 
Accordingly, I agree with NBNA’s call for the 
117th Congress to: 
1. Support (H.R. 8845), the Multi-Cancer 
Early Detection Screening Coverage Act which 
would ensure prompt access to FDA-approved 
multi-cancer screening tests and fuel innova-
tion in cancer screening. 
2. Support legislation that would provide on-
going research and education for minorities 
impacted by cancer. 
3. Support legislation that limits and reduces 
the cost of cancer medications and medical 
treatment for all populations with an emphasis 
on disproportionately impacted Black and 
other communities of color. 
4. Support legislation (H.R. 1570) to Re-
move Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening 
and to modify cost-sharing requirements for 
colorectal cancer screening tests, and drug 
manufacturer reporting requirements under 
Medicare medical services. 
5. Support legislation (H.R. 113) to provide 
for research and education with respect to tri-
ple negative breast cancer and for other pur-
poses. 
More than 600,000 uninsured African Ameri-
cans with incomes below the poverty line are 
among the 2.2 million adults who have no ac-
cess to affordable health coverage simply be-
cause they live in one of 12 states that have 
refused to take up the Affordable Care Act’s 
Medicaid expansion. 
Permanently closing the Medicaid coverage 
gap is essential to remedy this racial health in-
equity. 
It has been over a decade since the pas-
sage of the Affordable Care Act. Of the 12 re-
maining states that have stubbornly declined 
to expand coverage to adults with low in-
comes, eight are in the South: Alabama, Flor-
ida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. 
Fully 60 percent of those in the coverage 
gap in 2019 were people of color, even though 
people of color represent just 41 percent of 
the adult population of the 12 states. 
Most live in Florida, Georgia, or Texas; 
more than 100,000 African Americans in each 
state fall into the coverage gap. 
In Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and 
South Carolina, a majority of those without a 
pathway to coverage are African American. 
In Texas, more than half of those in the cov-
erage gap—422,000 people—are Latinos. 
Who are the people in the coverage gap? 
They are parents, often with young children. 
They are working people. 
Many are essential workers who have kept 
our nation going during the pandemic by work-
ing in grocery stores and health care jobs. 
Yet they have no health coverage and no 
way to get it. 
By permanently closing the Medicaid cov-
erage gap, Congress can improve the financial 
security of African Americans and Latinos as 
well as their health. 
Medicaid expansion is a powerful tool 
against financial hardship and bankruptcy be-
cause it prevents catastrophic out-of-pocket 
medical costs. 
Providing this safeguard is particularly crit-
ical for African Americans, given the substan-
tial racial wealth gap. 
Closing the Medicaid gap will also help ad-
dress the Black maternal health crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1320 
March 7, 2022 
States that expanded Medicaid have seen 
improved access to preconception and pre-
natal services that make pregnancy and birth 
safer for parents and babies. 
Medicaid expansion is associated with re-
duced rates of maternal death, particularly for 
Black women. 
Yet 235,000 Black women of reproductive 
age with incomes below the poverty line re-
mained uninsured in 2019 without any path-
way to affordable health coverage. 
Almost all of them live in the Southern 
states that have refused to expand Medicaid. 
Consider these stark and persistent racial 
disparities in health coverage, chronic health 
conditions, mental health, and mortality be-
tween black and white Americans. 
An African American or Black person is any 
individual with total or partial ancestry from 
any of the Black racial groups of Africa. 
In 2017, 10.6 percent of African Americans 
were uninsured compared with 5.9 percent of 
non-Hispanic whites. 
89.4 percent of African Americans had 
health care coverage in 2017 compared with 
93.7 percent of white Americans. 
44.1 percent of African Americans had gov-
ernment health insurance coverage in 2017. 
12.1 percent of Africans Americans under 
the age of 65 reported having no health insur-
ance coverage. 
13.8 percent of African Americans reported 
having fair or poor health compared with 8.3 
percent of non-Hispanic whites. 
Eighty percent of African American women 
are overweight or obese compared to 64.8 
percent of non-Hispanic white women. 
In 2017, 12.6 percent of African American 
children had asthma compared with 7.7 per-
cent of non-Hispanic white children. Forty-two 
percent of African American adults over age 
20 suffer from hypertension compared with 
28.7 percent of non-Hispanic white adults. 
In 2018, 8.7 percent of African American 
adults received mental health services com-
pared with 18.6 percent of non-Hispanic white 
adults. 
6.2 percent of African American adults re-
ceived prescription medication for mental 
health services compared with 15.3 percent of 
non-Hispanic white adults. 
In 2018, 3.8 percent of African American 
adults reported serious psychological distress. 
These disparities are not a result of indi-
vidual or group behavior but decades of sys-
tematic inequality in American economic, 
housing, and health care systems. 
Alleviating health disparities will require a 
deliberate and sustained effort to address so-
cial determinants of health, such as poverty, 
segregation, environmental degradation, and 
racial discrimination. 
Madam Speaker, in 2019, I introduced a 
Jackson Lee Amendment to the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which was adopted to 
address the issue of Maternity Mortality. 
I am pleased to report that the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 
did include the adoption of a maternity mor-
tality amendment that I offered. 
This Jackson Lee Amendment directs the 
Secretary of Defense to produce a report on 
maternity mortality rates among members of 
the Armed Forces and their dependents, 
which will include the Coast Guard to draw at-
tention to the incident maternal mortality. 
Between 1990 and 2015 it is reported that 
maternal mortality rates around the world fell 
by 30 percent, while at the same time in the 
US, the ratio went up nearly 60 percent. 
A 2012, Pentagon report states that mothers 
delivering at military hospitals are more likely 
to hemorrhage after childbirth than mothers at 
civilian hospitals. 
More than 50,000 babies are born at military 
hospitals each year, and they are twice as 
likely 
to 
be 
injured 
during 
delivery 
as 
newborns nationwide. 
In the United States, black women are 2 to 
6 times more likely to die from complications 
of pregnancy than white women, depending 
on where they live. 
Dating back from 1979 to 1992 maternity 
mortality was analyzed, the overall pregnancy- 
related mortality ratio was 25.1 deaths per 
100,000 for black women, 10.3 for Hispanic 
women, and 6.0 for non-Hispanic white 
women. 
These numbers did not improve between 
1987 and 1996. 
During 2011–2015, the pregnancy-related 
mortality ratios were— 
42.8 deaths per 100,000 live births for black 
non-Hispanic women; 
32.5 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
American Indian/Alaskan Native non-Hispanic 
women; 
14.2 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
Asian/Pacific Islander non-Hispanic women; 
13.0 deaths per 100,000 live births for white 
non-Hispanic women; and 
11.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for His-
panic women. 
Black women in the United States experi-
ence unacceptably poor maternal health out-
comes, including disproportionately high rates 
of death related to pregnancy or childbirth. 
African American women have the highest 
rates of obesity or being overweight compared 
to other groups in the United States. 
About 4 out of 5 African American women 
are overweight or obese. 
Obesity in the African American community 
has been a growing concern in recent dec-
ades and can be attributed to a multitude of 
societal elements. 
Contributing factors include but are not lim-
ited to inequities in stable and affordable 
housing, risks of living in food deserts, in-
come, and access to quality education. 
Each one of these factors has the potential 
to directly or indirectly influence an individual’s 
chance to live a longer and healthier life. 
In addition, if one combines those cir-
cumstances with disparities in access to af-
fordable and healthy food or safe places to be 
physically active, the picture of obesity in the 
African American community begins to take 
shape. 
Among African American adults, nearly 48 
percent are clinically obese (including 37.1 
percent of men and 56.6 percent of women, 
compared to 32.6 percent of whites (including 
32.4 percent of men and 32.8 percent of 
women). 
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention found that among 148,494 U.S. adults 
with COVID–19, a nonlinear relationship was 
found between body mass index (BMI) and 
COVID–19 severity, with lowest risks at BMIs 
near the threshold between healthy weight 
and overweight in most instances, then in-
creasing with higher BMI. 
Overweight and obesity were risk factors for 
invasive mechanical ventilation. 
Obesity was a risk factor for hospitalization 
and death, particularly among adults aged <65 
years. 
Using data from the Premier Healthcare 
Database Special COVID–19 Release the 
CDC assessed the association between body 
mass index (BMI) and risk for severe COVID– 
19 outcomes as defined by hospitalization, 
stays in intensive care units and the use of 
invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. 
Among 148,494 adults who received a 
COVID–19 diagnosis during an emergency de-
partment (ED) or inpatient visit at 238 U.S. 
hospitals during March–December 2020, 28.3 
percent had overweight and 50.8 percent had 
obesity. 
Overweight and obesity were risk factors for 
invasive mechanical ventilation, and obesity 
was a risk factor for hospitalization and death, 
particularly among adults aged <65 years. 
Risks for hospitalization, ICU admission, 
and death were lowest among patients with 
BMIs of 24.2 kg/m2, 25.9 kg/m2, and 23.7 kg/ 
m2, respectively, and then increased sharply 
with higher BMIs. 
Risk for invasive mechanical ventilation in-
creased over the full range of BMIs, from 15 
kg/m2 to 60 kg/m. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD three publications relating to 
racial health disparities.

FAMILY RAVAGED
BY CORONAVIRUS BEGGED 
FOR TESTS, HOSPITAL CARE
BUT
WAS RE-
PEATEDLY DENIED 
(By Kristen Jordan Shamus) 
DETROIT—The 
man 
who 
raised 
Keith 
Gambrell, who loved him like a son and mar-
ried his mother, died in a blue recliner of 
novel coronavirus in his Michigan home. 
Gary Fowler, 56, went to the emergency 
rooms of three metro Detroit hospitals in 
the weeks leading up to his death, begging 
for a coronavirus test, begging for help be-
cause he was having difficulty breathing, but 
he was repeatedly turned away, Gambrell 
said. 
‘‘My dad passed at home, and no one tried 
to help him,’’ Gambrell, 33, said through 
tears. ‘‘He asked for help, and they sent him 
away. They turned him away.’’ 
In the hours before his death, breathing 
was so difficult, Fowler slept sitting up in 
the bedroom chair, while his wife, Cheryl, 
dozed in the bed by his side. When she woke, 
her husband of nearly 24 years was gone. 
Before he took his last breaths, Fowler 
scrawled on a piece of paper, ‘‘Heart beat ir-
regular . . . oxygen level low.’’ 
‘‘My little brother called me, screaming, 
‘Daddy won’t wake up!’ ’’ Gambrell said. 
By the time Gambrell got across town to 
their house on the morning of April 7, police 
and emergency medical workers had arrived. 
His dad was still in the recliner. A bluish 
tinge had settled on his lips and fingers. 
‘‘I went up and talked to him,’’ Gambrell 
said, his voice breaking. ‘‘I told him I love 
him and that I’ll see him again one day and 
that I’m sorry we couldn’t even have a fu-
neral for him. 
‘‘I just felt so bad because he was begging 
for his life, and medical professionals did 
nothing for him.’’ 
The virus has brought renewed attention 
to health disparities for people of color. 
‘‘About 33 percent of the cases of COVID–19 
in this entire state of Michigan are in Afri-
can Americans, and about 40 percent . . . of 
the deaths,’’ Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the chief 
medical executive for the Michigan Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, said 
during a Facebook Live interview Thursday 
with Detroit’s Civil Rights, Inclusion and 
Equal Opportunity Department. ‘‘And that’s 
incredibly concerning. We know that African

Americans are only about 14 percent of the 
entire population.’’ 
Gambrell lives in Detroit’s 48235 ZIP code, 
a coronavirus hot zone with the highest in-
fection rate per capita—162 cases per 10,000 
residents—and the highest number of con-
firmed cases of the virus at 724, according to 
data released Friday by the city. 
Denise Fair, Detroit’s chief public health 
officer, said coronavirus testing remains a 
barrier for many in the community, as does 
access to care. 
‘‘It’s estimated that there are upwards of 
10 people with undetected infections for 
every confirmed case, and in some commu-
nities, the estimates are even higher,’’ she 
said. 
Dozens of factors feed the health dispari-
ties for people of color, said Khaldun, who 
formerly worked as the director and health 
officer for the Detroit Department of Health.

CANCER DISPARITIES IN THE BLACK 
COMMUNITY 
African Americans have a higher cancer 
burden and face greater obstacles to cancer 
prevention, detection, treatment, and sur-
vival. In fact, Black people have the highest 
death rate and shortest survival of any ra-
cial/ethnic group for most cancers in the 
U.S. Research has shown that: 
African Americans experience more illness, 
worse outcomes, and premature death com-
pared to whites. 
African Americans have the highest death 
rate and shortest survival of any racial/eth-
nic group for most cancers. African Amer-
ican men also have the highest cancer inci-
dence. 
Cancer death rates in black men is twice as 
high as in Asians and Pacific Islanders, who 
have the lowest rates. 
Prostate cancer death rates in black men 
are more than double those of every other 
racial/ethnic group. 
Black women are 40 percent more likely to 
die of breast cancer than white women and 
are twice as likely to die if they are over 50. 
About a third of Africa American women 
reported experiencing racial discrimination 
at a health provider visit. 
Living in segregated communities and 
areas highly populated with African Ameri-
cans has been associated with increased 
chances of getting diagnosed with cancer 
after it has spread, along with having higher 
death rates and lower rates of survival from 
breast and lung cancers. 
HEALTH DISPARITIES IN THE UNITED STATES 
AFRICAN AMERICANS OR BLACK AMERICANS 
An African American or Black person is 
any individual with total or partial ancestry 
from any of the Black racial groups of Afri-
ca. 
HEALTH COVERAGE 
In 2017, 10.6 percent of African Americans 
were uninsured compared with 5.9 percent of 
non-Hispanic whites. 
89.4 percent of African Americans had 
health care coverage in 2017 compared with 
93.7 percent of white Americans. 
44.1 percent of African Americans had gov-
ernment health insurance coverage in 2017. 
12.1 percent of Africans Americans under 
the age of 65 reported having no health in-
surance coverage. 
CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS 
13.8 percent of African Americans reported 
having fair or poor health compared with 8.3 
percent of non-Hispanic whites. 
Eighty 
percent 
of 
African 
American 
women are overweight or obese compared to 
64.8 percent of non-Hispanic white women. 
In 2017, 12.6 percent of African American 
children had asthma compared with 7.7 per-
cent 
of 
non-Hispanic 
white 
children. 
Fortytwo 
percent 
of 
African 
American 
adults over age 20 suffer from hypertension 
compared with 28.7 percent of non-Hispanic

MENTAL HEALTH 
In 2018, 8.7 percent of African American 
adults received mental health services com-
pared with 18.6 percent of non-Hispanic white 
adults. 
6.2 percent of African American adults re-
ceived prescription medication for mental 
health services compared with 15.3 percent of 
non-Hispanic white adults. 
In 2018, 3.8 percent of African American 
adults reported serious psychological dis-
tress. 
LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH 
The leading causes of death among African 
Americans are heart disease, cancer. and ac-
cidents. 
African Americans have the highest mor-
tality rate for all cancers combined com-
pared with any other racial and ethnic 
group. 
There are 11 infant deaths per 1,000 live 
births among Black Americans. This is al-
most twice the national average of 5.8 infant 
deaths per 1,000 live births. 
11.4 per 100,000 African American men and 
2.8 per 100,000 of African American women 
die by suicide. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I would like to express my apprecia-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. BROWN) is recognized for the 
remainder of the hour as the designee 
of the majority leader. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and also 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES) for hosting this Special Order 
hour. I would like to thank my sister 
Chair BEATTY and all my Congressional 
Black Caucus colleagues for their con-
tinued work to shine a spotlight on ra-
cial health disparities. 
Dr. Martin Luther King once said, 
‘‘Of all the forms of inequality, injus-
tice in healthcare is the most shocking 
and inhumane.’’ Madam Speaker, what 
was true in Dr. King’s time continues 
to be true in our own. Communities of 
color have long experienced inadequate 
access to healthcare, housing, healthy 
food, and economic opportunity. 
These 
inequalities 
independently, 
and working together, increase the 
prevalence of a host of dangerous 
health conditions, including diabetes, 
asthma, obesity, heart disease, and 
high blood pressure. 
One of the most shocking examples of 
health inequity is our Nation’s mater-
nal and infant mortality crisis. Infants 
born to Black mothers are nearly twice 
as likely to die compared to those born 
to White mothers. Continuing after 
birth, minority Americans face far 
higher rates of illness and death from 
an array of conditions. 
And what does this lead to, you 
might ask? Well, I am glad you did. 
Black Americans have a life expect-
ancy that is 4 years—I repeat, 4 years— 
shorter than White Americans. 
The COVID pandemic’s dispropor-
tionate impact on minority Americans 
exacerbated and exposed these dispari-
ties and the underlying inequalities 
driving them. Black and Brown Ameri-
cans have faced far higher rates of hos-
pitalization and death during the pan-
demic, and a growing body of research 
confirms what we have suspected—no, 
what we have known, what we have 
known for years—and that is there is 
an undeniable link between historical 
racism and the present-day medical 
health problems Black Americans face. 
Health disparities that disproportion-
ately impact Black Americans, from 
heart disease to maternal and infant 
mortality, are not merely an aberra-
tion. No, they are a direct result of 
structural, systemic, and institutional 
racism that has been passed down from 
generation to generation. 
To build a healthier America for all, 
we must address the generational in-
justices that drive the racial inequities 
we continue to see today. That is why 
I was proud to declare racism as a pub-
lic health crisis as a county council 
member, and that is why I am proud to 
work today with my Congressional 
Black Caucus colleagues to improve 
health outcomes for minority Ameri-
cans 
and 
to 
address 
injustice 
in 
healthcare and throughout our society. 
As Dr. King said, injustice anywhere 
is a threat to justice everywhere. That 
is our power and our message. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE), 
my friend. 
b 2000 
Mr. 
PAYNE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for 
those wonderful remarks and her con-
tinued leadership here in the House of 
Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss health equity disparities in Amer-
ica. Today, American minorities do not 
get the same quality of healthcare as 
our White counterparts, and it causes 
too many of them to die needlessly 
every single day. It is a problem that 
we must solve immediately. 
The numbers tell the story. African 
Americans are 24 percent more likely 
to die in this country than White 
Americans. 
The average life expectancy for a 
White American male is 75. For Black 
American males, it is about 71. 
African Americans between 18 and 49 
years old are twice as likely to die 
from heart disease than our White 
counterparts. 
African Americans between 35 and 64 
years old are 50 percent more likely to 
have high blood pressure than our 
counterparts. 
One out of every five African-Amer-
ican deaths could have been prevented 
if they received the same level of 
healthcare as White Americans. 
This should not be a surprise to any-
one. Research shows that Black Ameri-
cans receive less and lower quality care

than White Americans for a variety of 
ailments. 
One study of 400 U.S. hospitals found 
that African Americans with heart dis-
ease received cheaper and older treat-
ments than White Americans, not the 
newest 
technology 
available. 
They 
were less likely to receive coronary by-
pass operations. If they were lucky 
enough to receive surgery, they were 
discharged earlier regardless of post- 
surgery health conditions. 
More than that, African-American 
women are less likely to receive a mas-
tectomy or radiation therapy if they 
are diagnosed with breast cancer. 
These disturbing facts are just part 
of the reason we need the Health Eq-
uity and Accountability Act. It would 
invest in solutions to make sure that 
all Americans had access to quality 
healthcare. It would help diversify our 
country’s medical workforce to im-
prove the care in marginalized commu-
nities. And it would eliminate the gaps 
in medical insurance coverage, particu-
larly for Medicare and Medicaid recipi-
ents. 
This is not all we must do. I am 
working diligently to improve the 
health disparities in how we treat 
colorectal cancer and limb amputa-
tions in this country. Colorectal cancer 
is the second-highest cause of cancer 
deaths and the fourth-highest cause of 
new cancers nationwide. This year, an 
estimated 150,000 Americans will be di-
agnosed with colorectal cancer. More 
than 52,000 people will die from it. 
It is an even greater problem in mi-
nority communities. African Ameri-
cans are 20 percent more likely to be 
diagnosed with colorectal cancer than 
White Americans. They are more likely 
to die from this deadly disease. 
Yet, colorectal cancer is one of the 
most preventable types of cancer if de-
tected early. That is why I am taking 
action to save lives from this dreaded 
disease. 
In the 116th Congress, my Removing 
Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screen-
ing Act was signed into law. It allows 
Medicare to cover procedures to re-
move cancerous growths, or polyps, 
during 
routine 
colorectal 
cancer 
screenings, called colonoscopies. 
In 
addition, 
I 
introduced 
the 
Colorectal Cancer Payment Fairness 
Act to provide this new coverage by 
the end of 2023. 
We must introduce more legislation 
and take more actions to encourage 
more 
colorectal 
and 
other 
cancer 
screenings and save lives. 
Another area of health disparity is 
limb amputations, specifically limb 
amputations related to peripheral ar-
tery disease, or PAD. It is a disease of 
the arteries that is related to condi-
tions that cause heart attacks. It can 
cause blockages in the arms and legs 
that could lead to amputations. 
There are more than 200,000 PAD pa-
tients who lose limbs to this disease 
every single year. It is even worse in 
minority communities, as usual. 
African Americans are three times 
more likely to have a limb amputated 
than other Americans. These patients 
are less likely to receive the proper 
screenings and treatment for PAD 
compared to White patients. 
Too few doctors who serve minority 
communities even know about PAD, so 
they miss the warning signs in patients 
that could have prevented amputa-
tions. But when they understand PAD, 
doctors can order a vascular screening 
and target it specifically. 
I cofounded the bipartisan Congres-
sional Colorectal Cancer Caucus and 
also the bipartisan Congressional PAD 
Caucus to create more awareness of 
these diseases. 
Awareness is key, but we must do 
more to close the gap in healthcare 
coverage and treatment. We must give 
all Americans access to the best med-
ical care. It will save thousands of lives 
every year in America, and it is simply 
the right thing to do. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Mr. PAYNE for those re-
marks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES 
FOR BLACK COMMUNITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES) is recognized for the 
remainder of the hour as the designee 
of the majority leader. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Ohio (Ms. BROWN) for allowing me the 
opportunity to speak. 
Madam Speaker, no human need is 
more important than health. Yet, no 
need is more neglected by America 
than Black health. 
There are two areas on which I am 
going to offer brief comments. The 
first is maternal mortality. Among in-
dustrialized nations, the United States 
has among the highest rates of mater-
nal mortality. 
The crisis of maternal health rep-
resents American exceptionalism in 
the worst sense of the word. America is 
exceptionally cruel to Black mothers, 
who, far too often, face fatal barriers 
to accessing maternal care before, dur-
ing, and after pregnancy. Although rep-
resenting only 13 percent of the popu-
lation, Black women account for near-
ly 40 percent of maternal deaths. 
There are racial disparities not only 
in maternal but also infant mortality. 
The Black community has a maternal 
mortality rate and an infant mortality 
rate that are more than double the 
mortality rates in the White commu-
nity. 
No healthcare program is more crit-
ical to maternal health than Medicaid, 
which pays 40 percent of births nation-
wide. Attempts by Republican Gov-
ernors to prevent Medicaid expansion 
has a disproportionately destructive 
impact on Black maternal health. 
What is most tragic is that most ma-
ternal deaths in America are prevent-
able and can be prevented with public 
investments like the Build Back Better 
Act. The Build Back Better Act is so 
urgently needed because it would bring 
a long-overdue expansion of Medicaid 
to every corner of Black America. 
The second topic is cancer. In 2022, 
more than 73,000 Black Americans are 
expected to die from cancer. When it 
comes to most cancers, Black Ameri-
cans have the highest death rate as 
well as the shortest rate of survival. 
In the long run, we must develop a 
cure for cancer in keeping with Presi-
dent Biden’s unity agenda. But in the 
short run, we must double down on 
early detection. We must invest in the 
development and distribution of multi- 
cancer early detection tests. 
Black Americans have a far lower 
likelihood of receiving early detection 
cancer screening than White Ameri-
cans. Early detection can mean the dif-
ference between life and death. It can 
mean early treatment, which can pre-
vent cancer from metastasizing beyond 
the point of no return. 
Early cancer screenings and diag-
noses are tragically less common in the 
Black community than elsewhere in 
America. Even in cases where the 
White community has a higher cancer 
incidence, the Black community will 
nonetheless have higher cancer mor-
tality because of racial disparities in 
early cancer detection and diagnosis. 
Expanding access to multi-cancer 
early detection tests would bring us 
closer to closing the racial gap in early 
detection and in early diagnosis, and in 
doing so, it would save lives. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on the 
subject of this special order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I am de-
lighted to be able to speak on the 
House floor today and talk about what 
we are witnessing, all Americans, as we 
turn on our televisions and see the hor-
rors in Europe. 
For the first time in eight decades, 
we are witnessing a mass, unprovoked 
ground and air invasion in continental 
Europe. Not since World War II have 
we seen this sort of aggressive, evil ac-
tion by one European nation against 
another, let alone such action by a 
global power and member of the United 
Nations Security Council.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1323 
March 7, 2022 
The tragedy unfolding today has no 
precedent in recent history, not even 
the 
terrible 
civil 
war 
and 
ethnic 
cleansing in the former Yugoslavia. 
b 2015 
Let’s be clear, Madam Speaker, Putin 
feels emboldened and believes that he 
can wield his power anywhere in the 
world, including in his own backyard in 
a pitiful but ruthless attempt to re-
store his idea of some 18th century 
Russian kingdom with himself as czar. 
Putin is emboldened by the fact that 
he has personally, and Russia as a na-
tion, not paid any significant economic 
or diplomatic price for his previous 
violations of international law, the 
U.N. Charter, or common decency and 
norms. 
One only has to recall the poisoning 
in a London park of an opposition voice 
in 2006, forging a partnership in 2015 
with the butcher Assad in mass de-
struction, murder, and mayhem in 
Syria, waltzing into Crimea without 
firing a shot in 2014, and his border in-
cursions into Georgia in 2008. 
Putin has simply marched on, tram-
pling international law and sovereign 
borders, all the while thumbing his 
nose, Madam Speaker, at international 
norms and the negligible reaction of 
his neighbors. 
In fact, his neighbors, dependent on 
the European drug of choice—Russian 
natural gas—for so long they just 
stared glassy-eyed at their enabler, un-
able to stand up for themselves and 
fight back. Now, these neighbors have 
rejected the dominance of Putin’s 
pushing and are fighting back. 
That is why America once more steps 
into the breach as the essential, indis-
pensable nation. Our resolve encour-
ages a stronger European Union and a 
stronger NATO. 
During the 20th century, our free-
dom-loving people consistently stepped 
up to push back against the disposition 
and destruction of individual rights, 
international norms, and sovereign na-
tions. 
Europe doesn’t want to go back to 
their 
ancient, 
feudal 
fights, 
and 
Ukrainians don’t want to return to vas-
sal state status under the boot of Rus-
sia. 
Ukrainians want to go forward. They 
don’t want to go backward. They don’t 
want to go back to the Berlin Airlift, 
Checkpoint Charlie, the Fulda Gap, and 
Churchill’s Iron Curtain. 
At the height of the Cold War, 
Madam Speaker, I traveled through 
Checkpoint Charlie to the other side of 
the Iron Curtain. I have witnessed 
what life is like in communism, social-
ism. I have laid a wreath at Auschwitz. 
I have laid a wreath on Decoration Day 
at the American Cemetery in Nor-
mandy. And, Madam Speaker, Ameri-
cans don’t want to go back to those 
days either. 
Our boys sacrificed their lives in the 
forests of Germany, the beaches of 
France, the hills of Italy, and the sands 
of North Africa to prevent this very 
thing from happening again. 
That is why American leadership is 
critical. Partnering with our trans-
atlantic allies, we must muster the 
military, economic, and diplomatic 
clout and might to hit this bully in the 
nose. Bullies only respect clout and 
might. 
While Europe and the United States 
were timid in the Obama-Merkel days, 
our collective leadership must fill the 
void now and push back once and for 
all against the assault on sovereignty 
and freedom we are witnessing in Eu-
rope. 
If not now, when? If not in Ukraine, 
on the borders of Ukraine, where, 
Madam Speaker? 
If we fail here, despots will race to 
trample borders around the world, and 
democracy and freedom everywhere 
will be in peril. 
RUSSIA’S SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to how the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
fuels 
Russia’s war on Ukraine by providing 
them a blank check in the form of spe-
cial drawing rights, or SDRs. 
Last week, I with 40 of my Repub-
lican colleagues in the House and the 
Senate, we wrote Treasury Secretary 
Janet Yellen urging that all IMF mem-
ber countries not bail out Russia by fa-
cilitating the exchange of Russian 
SDRs with their own hard currency. 
Russia was handed a blank check of 
nearly $17 billion equivalent in SDRs 
by the IMF just last year and has an 
estimated total of $24 billion in SDR 
reserves. This should have never hap-
pened, Madam Speaker, and that is 
why I have been so adamant for years 
about limiting the issue of IMF special 
drawing rights. 
Earlier last week, the United States 
and other countries expanded economic 
sanctions against the Russian Central 
Bank, and while this is a late but wel-
come development, we must do more. 
For decades, Russia has been accu-
mulating a war chest that includes 
gold, international reserves, and im-
portantly, special drawing rights. And 
with the ruble tanking in open mar-
kets, the Kremlin’s access to foreign 
currency reserves being cut off, these 
SDRs are one of the only remaining 
ways that Russia can access financial 
resources for its warmongering in the 
Ukraine. 
That is why now is the time for the 
U.S. to lead at the IMF for calling on 
all member countries, including China, 
Madam Speaker, to formally agree not 
to facilitate any exchange of their cur-
rencies with Russia’s SDRs. 
We are already seeing China and Rus-
sia deepening their ties, forming the 
latest and newest axis of evil. We can-
not allow Moscow to turn to Beijing for 
an SDR bailout. As the largest share-
holder of the IMF, the United States 
has a responsibility to ensure that 
these resources are not hijacked to fuel 
Russian bombs and tanks. 
SMALL LENDER ACT 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to the latest 
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, the CFBP, proposed small busi-
ness data collection regulation. It is 
called section 1071. 
Access to capital for small businesses 
is the lifeblood of each of our local 
economies, and for many, the commu-
nity bank lender is often leading the 
way in supporting our entrepreneurs in 
small businesses across our districts. 
And yet, the CFPB’s new regulation, 
if finalized, would actually hurt small 
business by making the cost of credit 
more expensive and imposing signifi-
cant compliance costs that would fall 
the hardest on the smallest lenders 
across our Nation. 
That is why I, along with Congress-
men WILLIAMS of Texas and LUETKE-
MEYER of Missouri have introduced the 
Small LENDER Act, a new bill that 
would provide regulatory relief to 
small business lenders by exempting 
them from this proposed CFPB 1071 
rule and providing an additional year 
to comply, plus a 2-year safe harbor. 
Specifically, my bill would expand 
the definition of a small lender as one 
that originates at least 500 small busi-
ness loans per year, instead of the 25- 
loan limit proposed by the CFPB. 
It would also codify a ‘‘small busi-
ness’’ as one with gross revenues of $1 
million or less instead of the $5 million 
threshold that the rule proposed. 
Finally, the bill extends the effective 
compliance date with the final rule to 
be 3 years plus that 2-year grace period 
instead of only 18 months as proposed 
by the CFPB. 
In the absence of Congress repealing 
section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
this bill would prevent some of the 
most harmful aspects of the rule from 
going into effect. I urge my colleagues 
to support the Small LENDER Act. 
ECONOMIC CRISIS OF INFLATION 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to the eco-
nomic crisis that has been fueled by 
the Biden administration’s out-of-con-
trol spending and the very accommoda-
tive monetary policies of our Federal 
Reserve. 
2021 was the worst year, Madam 
Speaker for consumer inflation since 
1981. 
Last year, inflation cost the average 
worker roughly two paychecks and the 
average family $3,500. 
And inflation doesn’t just impact 
major corporations, but also our small 
businesses, 61 percent of which have 
had to raise prices in the last month in 
order just to try to keep up with infla-
tion. 
Of course, getting people back to 
work will greatly aid supply chains, 
thus we need to encourage work. But 
President Biden’s policies of vaccine 
mandates, higher regulations on em-
ployers and policies to cut the supply 
of energy hurt the cause of getting our 
citizens back to work. 
The President has called this infla-
tion ‘‘transitory’’ and caused only by 
‘‘supply chain’’ disruptions and greedy 
corporations. Madam Speaker, in my 
view, this is just pure political theater.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1324 
March 7, 2022 
Yet, instead of addressing these con-
cerns, working to get spending under 
control and our Nation’s economy fully 
back on track, President Biden spent 
the bulk of his State of the Union 
speech doubling down on those policies 
that got us into this inflationary situa-
tion in the first place. 
Central Arkansans’ pockets are hurt-
ing. 
The President should stop proposing 
to spend trillions more. The President 
should cut regulatory burdens hin-
dering hiring employers like truck 
drivers, 
general 
contractors, 
and 
health service employees. 
The President should unleash Amer-
ican energy to help bring down prices 
for U.S. consumers and help our strug-
gling allies in Europe. 
I urge the Biden administration and 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle to reach across the aisle to help 
bring relief to the American people and 
get back to our prepandemic spending 
priorities and alleviate the burdens 
that many face across our country, 
particularly the burden of inflation. 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to the crisis 
at our southwest border. 
In January, U.S. Customs and Border 
Patrol reported over 153,941 migrant 
encounters at our southwest border, 
which represented a 320 percent in-
crease over January of 2020. 
Of the over 150,000 migrants who were 
encountered, the Biden administration 
opened the door and said come in, re-
leasing about 60,000 migrants into the 
United States. 
Deportations are down 70 percent 
when compared to 2020, averaging 
about 100 a day, and that was in the 
face of 7,000 migrants appearing at our 
border each day. 
Officials at our southern border have 
estimated that nearly 400,000 illegal 
immigrants have successfully crossed 
the border without being caught. So 
not being interdicted, not being proc-
essed, not being turned back. 
Those numbers, like the inflation 
that we are experiencing, are out of 
control. 
These numbers are unacceptable, and 
we need to get back on track. I have 
encouraged the Biden administration 
for over a year now, return to those 
Trump-era policies that were control-
ling the flow across the border, resume 
construction on the wall, resume sup-
port of our personnel on the border, re-
sume the efforts to control and secure 
our southwest border. 
AMERICA’S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to bring awareness to an issue that 
concerns all Americans, and that is 
America’s energy independence. 
Every day the U.S. is importing near-
ly 600,000 barrels of oil from Russia. As 
we continue to increase sanctions 
against Russia, we must also keep the 
American people in mind, who are al-
ready feeling the effects of inflation 
each day when they visit the pump. 
We need to boost domestic produc-
tion now. That should be our priority, 
boosting American production. Prior to 
the pandemic we were producing 13 
million barrels a day. Today, we are 
producing about 11 million barrels per 
day. That would more than make up 
for this Russian oil that for some rea-
son we are still importing. 
This week, I received a call from a 
constituent. This constituent is on a 
fixed income, and she shared with me 
her concerns about filling up at the gas 
station. She shared with me her con-
cerns about Ukraine and asked if she 
should expect her gas bill to increase 
even more as tensions rise. And the an-
swer to that question, Madam Speaker 
is I believe that is right, that is what is 
going to happen. 
And that is why we can benefit Eu-
rope and benefit American consumers 
by unleashing American energy pro-
duction and get back to those 13 mil-
lion barrels a day. That way we can off-
set what we have been importing from 
Russia and benefit our American con-
sumers. 
b 2030 
GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
highlight the important work being ac-
complished through the success of the 
Great American Outdoors Act, the bi-
partisan 
conservation 
legislation 
signed into law by President Trump. 
In Arkansas, I recently had the op-
portunity to visit one of those sites 
and visit with leaders at the National 
Forest System spearheading this effort 
at Blanchard Springs Caverns in the 
Ozark National Forest. 
These incredible caverns not only at-
tract thousands each year to Arkansas, 
but they have a robust economic im-
pact on the surrounding areas as they 
are enjoyed by all Americans each 
year. 
Thanks to funding by the Great 
American Outdoors Act, the cabins are 
able to undergo much-needed renova-
tions to improve the existing trail sys-
tem and lighting system throughout 
the caverns and invest in preventative 
measures to enhance the safety and re-
siliency of the underground system. 
This allows the caverns to be enjoyed 
by American families for years to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, these improvements 
that are underway as a result of this 
bipartisan achievement are the first 
major capital expenditures spent on 
this beautiful cavern since it was 
opened during the Nixon administra-
tion. So, I look forward to these funds 
continuing to support various projects 
in the Natural State and look forward 
to their enhancement in the years to 
come. 
OPIOID CRISIS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to draw attention to the opioid 
crisis in Arkansas and across our Na-
tion. 
Each day, over 250 individuals lose 
their lives to an opioid-related over-
dose. According to the CDC, we lost a 
record number of 99,106 people between 
March 2020 and March 2021. What a 
milestone. What a grim milestone. 
My home State of Arkansas has one 
of the highest opioid-prescribing rates 
in our Nation. In Arkansas alone, we 
lost at least 225 of our neighbors in this 
crisis. 
Opioid misuse and addiction begin at 
home, coming from a familiar medicine 
cabinet. More Americans lose their 
lives to addiction than from car acci-
dents, guns, or HIV. 
This is a crisis, a growing crisis, and 
one that is reaching new highs. These 
deaths are preventable, and it is up to 
each of us to do our part to save lives 
and combat the disease that is addic-
tion. 
That is why, last September, I intro-
duced 
the 
bipartisan 
Preventing 
Overdoses and Saving Lives Act with 
my colleague from Michigan, Rep-
resentative DEBBIE DINGELL. My bipar-
tisan bill will create a grant program 
allowing States and localities to con-
duct research on the opioid crisis, cre-
ate a strategic plan on how to respond 
to the crisis, and implement co-pre-
scribing under certain circumstances. 
Increasing access to naloxone reduces 
opioid fatalities. If this bill passes, it 
will save lives. 
Madam Speaker, we have seen that in 
Arkansas, one of 14 States that offers 
co-prescriptions for opioid prescription 
recipients. I would like to see that 
broader across our Nation. Lives will 
be saved. 
In this bill, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join Congresswoman DIN-
GELL and I in this fight. 
BE PRO BE PROUD 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak about Be Pro Be Proud, 
an initiative launched in 2016 as a re-
sponse to the workforce shortage expe-
rienced in my home State of Arkansas. 
Be Pro Be Proud is a technical pro-
gram that introduces students and 
young adults to skilled trade jobs and 
the well-paid opportunities that these 
jobs unlock. 
In the past 5 years, Be Pro Be Proud’s 
mobile workshop has completed over 
500 stops in the State of Arkansas and 
recruited over 20,000 individuals who 
have joined the movement to learn 
more about key trades, new opportuni-
ties, and finding that career that is 
right for them. 
After seeing the tremendous success 
in Arkansas, the initiative has ex-
panded to surrounding States. We have 
traveled around the country exposing 
young adults to this kind of oppor-
tunity—in middle school and high 
school—a career that starts imme-
diately after high school graduation. 
In January, I had the pleasure of 
joining Governor Asa Hutchinson and 
State and local leaders to announce 
that Be Pro Be Proud was awarded $1.45 
million in a grant to support the 
launch of a second mobile workshop to 
bring this story to schools all over Ar-
kansas.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SAM 
CHAFFIN 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and legacy 
of a dear friend and a great Rotary 
International colleague, my friend Sam 
Chaffin. I was sad to share the news 
with my friends that Sam passed away 
in November. 
Born in 1936, in Magnolia, Arkansas, 
he was a proud graduate of the Univer-
sity of Arkansas, where he earned a 
master’s degree in industrial engineer-
ing. Shortly after graduation, Sam 
opened his own business, Eagle Mate-
rial Handling of Arkansas, which spe-
cialized in material and manufacturing 
management. 
In 1975, Sam joined the Rotary Club 
of Little Rock, Club 99. During his time 
in Rotary, Sam served in many leader-
ship positions, including foundation 
chair, president of our club, and dis-
trict governor. Through our work to-
gether in Rotary, we had the oppor-
tunity to go to Lacombe, Louisiana, 
following Katrina and help many, 
many families rebuild their homes. 
Madam Speaker, we couldn’t have 
done that at our club, the Rotary Club 
of Little Rock, without Sam’s instru-
mental leadership. He was a friend to 
all who were blessed to know him. My 
thoughts are with his wife, Charlie; 
children, Cole and Marty; and his 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
Sam, thank you for your impact on 
our community, our Rotary Club, Ro-
tary International, and our State. 
RECOGNIZING SCIPIO AFRICANUS JONES 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exemplary Ar-
kansan, Scipio Africanus Jones. 
Scipio Jones was born into slavery in 
Arkansas in 1863. Throughout his life, 
he attended Black schools near his 
hometown, 
eventually 
earning 
his 
bachelor’s degree from Arkansas’ own 
Shorter College. 
Although there were no schools for 
African Americans to study law in Ar-
kansas, Scipio took on the challenge 
himself and began studying independ-
ently and, in 1889, passed the Arkansas 
Bar. He began his career in Pulaski 
County and, in 1900, was admitted to 
the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
In 1919, 12 Black sharecroppers had 
been sentenced to death for their al-
leged role in the Elaine Massacre, 
while 87 other defendants also awaited 
trial. Scipio Jones’ primary goal was to 
secure a fair trial for the 87 defendants. 
After his partner’s unexpected passing, 
he became the lead attorney in the ap-
peals process for the 12 defendants who 
had been sentenced to death. 
Of the 12 original sharecroppers who 
had been sentenced to death, charges 
were dismissed against six, while the 
other six had their sentences com-
muted. The remaining 87 defendants re-
ceived pardons from the Governor of 
Arkansas. 
Following these immense legal vic-
tories, Scipio Jones remained an advo-
cate for the Black community across 
Arkansas. In recognition of his advo-
cacy, the United States Post Office in 
downtown Little Rock was named in 
his honor in 2007. 
In 2020, President Trump signed into 
law my bill, which facilitated a large, 
full-sized portrait of Scipio Jones to be 
displayed in that post office. Last 
week, I had the honor, with all of our 
citizens, to gather and unveil this 
beautiful portrait of Scipio Jones at 
the post office named for him. 
Special thanks are owed to John Gill, 
Garbo Hearne, artist Wade Hampton, 
and the Central Arkansas Library Sys-
tem for all of their collaboration in 
making this wonderful portrait a re-
ality. It will serve as a reminder of the 
legal skill, persistence, bravery, and di-
plomacy of Scipio Jones, permanently 
honoring him as the amazing legal 
leader and citizen that he was. 
HONORING DAISY BATES 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Daisy Bates and her 
brave actions that shaped American 
history and Arkansas history. 
When Daisy Bates moved to Little 
Rock in the early 1940s, she imme-
diately joined the NAACP and became 
a leader in our African-American com-
munity. As a civil rights activist in 
Little Rock, Daisy Bates played a lead-
ing role in the integration of Little 
Rock’s schools and served as a mentor 
to the Little Rock Nine. 
Her bravery and leadership led her to 
achieve 
the 
unimaginable—sparking 
change across our whole Nation. Just 
last month, I had the opportunity to 
visit with students and speak about her 
impact and her legacy at the Daisy 
Bates Elementary School in Little 
Rock. 
Daisy’s accomplishments deserve to 
be recognized, and I am proud that 
Daisy Bates and her legacy will be me-
morialized here in the United States 
Capitol. Soon, her statue will become 
part of the collection in the National 
Statuary Hall, commemorating her 
bravery, strength, and leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
honoring that memory and continuing 
her fight for equality every time I pass 
that statue in our Capitol. 
RECOGNIZING ARMY COLONEL MIKE ROSS 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Retired Army Colo-
nel Mike Ross and his selfless leader-
ship with Veterans Villages of Amer-
ica. 
Colonel Ross is a combat veteran 
with 37 years of military service. He 
has received numerous awards, includ-
ing the Legion of Merit, the Bronze 
Star, and the Meritorious Service 
Medal. 
Currently, Colonel Ross serves on the 
board of directors for Veterans Villages 
of America, where he operates a food 
pantry for veterans, military per-
sonnel, and their immediate family 
members. They also network in our 
communities to meet the needs of our 
veterans—and I mean all the needs of 
our veterans. Colonel Ross is indeed 
tireless. 
Although he is retired, he continues 
to give back to others, serve others, 
and work tirelessly for American mili-
tary families and our veterans to en-
sure they are well cared for. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Colonel 
Ross for his outstanding service and 
dedication to our community and cen-
tral Arkansas veterans. 
RECOGNIZING MONTINE MCNULTY 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
the 
career 
of 
Montine McNulty. 
After serving 25 years as the head of 
the Arkansas Hospitality Association, 
Montine has announced her well-de-
served 
retirement. 
Early 
in 
2020, 
Montine thought about retirement, but 
when COVID–19 hit, she made a deci-
sion to stay and guide her organization 
through the pandemic in the midst of 
such great uncertainty. 
Montine, I commend your embodying 
of the motto, ‘‘Service Above Self,’’ 
and I hope you enjoy every moment of 
your retirement. 
Madam Speaker, it is also important 
that we take a moment and recognize 
Katie Beck, the new head of the Arkan-
sas Hospitality Association. Katie has 
had a distinguished career in serving 
Governor Hutchinson’s communication 
department, and I know she will bring 
that drive, that spirit, as the new head 
of the AHA. 
The Arkansas Hospitality Associa-
tion is very valuable for our State, and 
I look forward to seeing where Katie 
takes 
the 
organization 
while 
con-
tinuing Montine’s legacy. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 31 minutes remaining. 
SHIFT BACK TO SOCIETY 
Mr. 
HILL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
United States currently has one of the 
highest 
prison 
populations 
in 
the 
world. Every year, we spend about 
$34,000 per inmate in our State. In Ar-
kansas, the current rate of reentry 
after re-offending is about 57 percent, 
one of the highest in the Nation. 
We can do better, which is why I in-
troduced the bipartisan Shift Back to 
Society Act. This bill would enact poli-
cies that avert individuals from re-of-
fending, keeping people out of prison. 
This is accomplished by providing 
funding for our historically Black col-
leges and universities for educational 
programming that they design for of-
fenders who have or who have almost 
completed serving their time, so engag-
ing to better prepare people we know 
that are going to be released. 
By developing this pathway to edu-
cation, we directly decrease the rate of 
recidivism. The more education an in-
dividual has, the less likely they are to 
re-offend. This legislation will save 
millions in current spending while cre-
ating an opportunity that will keep in-
dividuals out of prison and transition

them back into being productive mem-
bers of society. 
As we currently face an uptick in 
crime, both in Arkansas and across our 
Nation, I am proud to bring forward a 
bill that will save taxpayer dollars as 
well as improve paths for successful re-
entry shifting back to society. 
CONGRATULATING MIKE POORE ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate my good friend, 
our superintendent of Little Rock Pub-
lic Schools, Mike Poore. 
Mike has decided to retire, and I wish 
him a happy and healthy retirement. 
In 2016, Mike made the move from 
northwest Arkansas to Little Rock 
with the goal of transforming the dis-
trict, which at the time was under the 
control of the State. 
b 2045 
In March 2020, when the world turned 
upside down because of the COVID–19 
pandemic, Mike did not skip a beat. He 
worked to make sure every teacher and 
every student had the technology need-
ed to continue learning with as little 
disruption as possible. 
He worked mightily with the district 
teachers and staff to make sure stu-
dents were back in the classroom. 
Madam Speaker, that was a great ac-
complishments of our State to have 
over 80 percent of our kids in the class-
room during the midst of the pan-
demic. Mike led that way. 
His other accomplishment included 
raising money for students in the com-
munity, increasing teachers’ salaries, 
and being named Arkansas’ Super-
intendent of the Year. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mike for his 
service and dedication to the Little 
Rock School District, his long-lasting 
impact in our community is appre-
ciated. 
Congratulations and our best wishes 
for his retirement. 
RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT MARCAL YOUNG 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize fellow Eagle Scout 
Marcal Young of Little Rock. I am con-
gratulating him on his career with the 
Boy Scouts of America having been ac-
tive with that organization for over 40 
years. 
Since its founding, the Boy Scouts of 
America have remained committed to 
the idea that educating our youth in 
citizenship, service, and leadership is 
best for their development, and an 
amazing opportunity of service for our 
Nation. 
Marcal has embraced these prin-
ciples, and in 2018 was named Scout Ex-
ecutive of the Qupaw Area Council. 
Throughout his career, he has had a 
positive impact on thousands of young 
people and their families, and as a re-
sult, their communities. 
With their character development 
and value-based leadership programs, 
over 2.5 million young men have 
achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. 
In 1972, I earned the rank of Eagle 
Scout at Troop 27 at Holy Souls Catho-
lic Church in Little Rock. To this day, 
it is one of my proudest accomplish-
ments. 
I am grateful for Marcal and his com-
mitment to Scouting and making those 
achievements possible for youth across 
the communities of our State. His lead-
ership and influence will be remem-
bered, and I wish him the very best in 
his well-earned retirement. 
RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF MARGARET 
ELLIBEE 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the retirement of 
Margaret Ellibee and commemorate 
her service of 11 years as chancellor at 
the University of Arkansas Pulaski 
Technical College. 
UA Pulaski Tech, a 2-year commu-
nity college in the heart of my district, 
has moved mountains for its students 
and faculty under her leadership. 
Margaret Ellibee’s critical decision 
to raise admission standards not only 
led to increased graduation rates but 
also reduced student loan default rates, 
positively impacting the school’s per-
formance and trustworthiness. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Margaret 
for making these achievements pos-
sible for our students and faculty, and 
I am grateful for her bold and robust 
leadership. Her legacy will be remem-
bered for years, and I wish her the very 
best of a well-earned retirement. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

No. 40 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, mighty to save, lift 
high our vision that we may see clearly 
that You are still in charge of Your 
world. 
Lord, give us the courage to follow 
Your precepts, realizing we have spir-
itual weapons for our warfare. In these 
trying and dangerous times, keep our 
lawmakers strong and pure and good. 
Remind them that we are fighting 
more than flesh and blood; we are en-
gaged in combat with principalities, 
powers, and wickedness in the celestial 
realm. Give us all the wisdom to keep 
our eyes on You, comprehending that 
all things are possible to those who be-
lieve. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the eyes of the American people and 
the entire world are fixed on Eastern 
Europe. Vladimir Putin is continuing 
his unjustifiable invasion of a sov-
ereign country and his unprovoked 
killing of innocent people. 
Over the weekend, Senators were 
honored to speak electronically with 
Ukraine’s 
brave 
leader, 
President 
Zelenskyy. His courageous leadership 
has helped rally freedom-loving people 
the world over to the Ukrainians’ 
cause. One of his main pleas was that 
America and our partners continue 
providing 
Ukraine 
with 
additional 
military assistance and to do so very 
quickly. Long before the invasion 
began, I was on this floor warning the 
Biden administration that we could not 
let assistance be trickled out at the 
speed of bureaucracy. I certainly hope 
that lesson has finally been learned. 
IRAN 
But even while one foreign policy 
nightmare plays out in Eastern Eu-
rope, inexplicably, the Biden adminis-
tration is reportedly poised to an-
nounce a giant, gratuitous capitulation 
to our principal adversary in the Mid-
dle East as well. 
The nature of the Biden administra-
tion’s approach to Tehran thus far has 
concerned not just Republicans but 
Members of both parties. 
Our Democratic colleague, the chair-
man of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, recently exhorted the adminis-
tration and our partners to ‘‘exert 
more pressure on Iran to counter its 
nuclear program, its missile program, 
and its dangerous behavior around the 
Middle East, including attacks on 
American personnel and [American] as-
sets.’’ 
I would note that Senator MENENDEZ 
also stressed the importance of build-
ing bipartisan support for any new deal 
which the President’s team wants to 
cook up with the Iranians. This is the 
same message I conveyed to the Presi-
dent and his top advisers at the begin-
ning of the Biden administration. If he 
wants his policy or his deal to endure 
beyond his Presidency, he must bring 
Republicans on board. 
Regrettably, President Biden appears 
to have ignored this good advice. Re-
ports indicate a sequel—a sequel—to 
the bad 2015 nuclear deal may be immi-
nent. Yet the administration has laid 
zero bipartisan framework. 
Rumors of this impending deal—be-
cause rumors are all that Congress 
has—suggest it would be an enormous 
step in the wrong direction. It appears 
not to be a longer and stronger deal 
than the JCPOA, as was promised, but 
a weaker and shorter deal. It appears

not to safeguard and increase our le-
verage over Tehran and its Revolu-
tionary Guard but instead to breezily, 
sort of, sign our leverage away. 
President Biden appears to want to 
give Tehran enduring sanctions relief 
now in exchange for limited and short- 
term curbs on their nuclear program. A 
reminder of how bad President Obama’s 
Iran deal was is the fact that these re-
strictions will begin to expire as soon 
as next year. That will put more pres-
sure on Western negotiators, not on 
Iran. 
This is extortion playing out step by 
step, and this administration seems 
prepared to sign on to it. Iran gets seri-
ous sanctions relief and expanded trade 
with Russia and China, their price is 
even fewer restrictions than the origi-
nal failed Iran deal, and those restric-
tions begin to expire in just 2 years. 
This is really wildly reckless. This is 
an administration chasing a deal—any 
deal—instead of pursuing our interests. 
There is some suspicion the adminis-
tration is desperate for any excuse to 
ease sanctions on Iranian oil exports to 
help blunt the impact of the European 
crisis on American’s pocketbooks. This 
White House seems determined to go 
hat in hand and beg every bad actor 
around the world to ramp up their own 
fossil fuel production but still will not 
stop their holy war against our own 
American energy production here at 
home. 
If press reports of the deal are accu-
rate, the President and the Democrats 
on Capitol Hill surely understand that 
it will not be accepted widely or quiet-
ly. 
If the President seeks to remove 
sanctions on Iran, there will be votes. 
Democrats who now regret their recent 
vote to protect the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline should think twice before vot-
ing to help President Biden ease sanc-
tions on Iranian entities that engage in 
terrorism, 
missile 
proliferation, 
or 
human rights abuses. 
Given Chairman MENENDEZ’s con-
cerns, I hope and would expect the For-
eign Relations Committee will hold 
major hearings. But I know this much 
for certain: The next time Republicans 
control the Senate, vigorous oversight 
will take place over the diplomatic 
mess that is unfolding in the Middle 
East: the failure to consolidate the his-
toric gains of the Abraham Accords; gi-
gantic unilateral concessions to the 
most active state sponsor of terrorism 
in the entire world; pointless capitula-
tion to Iran-backed Houthi terrorists 
that has only yielded even more vio-
lence in Yemen and increased ballistic 
missile and drone attacks against 
Saudi and Emirati cities. 
It is bad enough that Democrats in 
Congress have spent months actively 
fighting against sufficient funding for 
our national defense and our Armed 
Forces, but these dynamics are made 
even more dangerous by a White House 
that is actively choosing weakness in 
the Middle East. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 260 
years ago, a young nobleman from Po-
land and a military officer helped lead 
a rebellion against what he and many 
others saw as a Russian puppet King in 
what was known as the Polish-Lithua-
nian Commonwealth. He was driven 
into exile in France, where Lafayette 
and Benjamin Franklin urged him to 
go to America to join in the fight, the 
Revolutionary War. 
That young Polish nobleman’s name 
was Casimir Pulaski. When he arrived 
in America, he wrote to General 
George Washington and said to him: 
I came here, where freedom is being de-
fended, to serve it, and to live or die by it. 
Pulaski was at Washington’s side and 
is credited with saving George Wash-
ington’s life at the Battle of Brandy-
wine. He is remembered fondly as the 
Father of the American Calvary. 
Pulaski died at age 34 in the fight for 
freedom and independence in America. 
Today is Casimir Pulaski Day, which 
we know full well in Illinois, where it 
is a State holiday. Today, however, we 
look at the world and realize that free-
dom is being defended in Ukraine. And 
today, we seek Casimir Pulaski’s spirit 
and fierce commitment to freedom and 
human dignity in a historic young 
Ukrainian President and in Ukrainian 
men and women who are fighting to 
save their Nation from another would- 
be Russian czar. 
I have been in Congress for a few 
years. Over the weekend, I had an expe-
rience unique to my service in Con-
gress. 
Early on Saturday morning, hun-
dreds of Members of Congress joined a 
video call with Ukrainian President 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I have never 
seen anything like it. 
With the Russian military laying 
siege to his country and a Russian 
bull’s-eye 
on 
his 
back, 
President 
Zelenskyy spoke to us with remarkable 
dignity and courage. He didn’t mince 
words about what is happening in 
Ukraine—the brutal Russian assaults 
literally trying to destroy his nation. 
He said we all share the same basic val-
ues and dreams: to live our lives in 
peace, watch our kids grow up, and to 
kiss them. He said the Ukrainian peo-
ple are fighting for these basic free-
doms, and they are prepared to be 
friends and share culture with their 
Russian neighbors, if they can. 
But over the last 12 days, his coun-
try, Ukraine, has faced full-fledged war 
with 
barbaric 
attacks 
on 
kinder-
gartens, nuclear powerplants, apart-
ment buildings, infrastructure, and in-
nocent civilians. 
Last Thursday, Russia and Ukraine 
agreed to create humanitarian cor-
ridors in Ukraine, to allow civilians in 
areas under the heaviest Russian at-
tacks to evacuate safely. Twice over 
the weekend, Ukraine was forced to 
close those corridors because Russia 
was attacking them mercilessly. This 
is Vladimir Putin’s war, deliberately 
targeting women and children who 
have left everything and are trying 
just to reach safety. 
This photo shows the result of one 
horrific attack by Russian soldiers on 
the people of Ukraine. Many people 
have seen it. It was on the front page of 
the New York Times this morning. It 
took place in the city of Irpin on Sun-
day. A Russian mortar struck an evac-
uation point where these civilians were 
waiting to board a bus to go to safety. 
Irpin’s mayor said the attack killed 
at least eight people, including a fam-
ily. Sadly, you can see the children 
lying on the street. These are among 
the 364 Ukrainians killed during the 
last 12 days of Putin’s barbaric war. 
Mr. Putin, these deaths, like the 
death of that little girl I showed on the 
floor last week, are your doing. Your 
reputation as a war criminal and a 
bloody tyrant is now sealed in history. 
More than 1.7 million Ukrainians 
have fled as refugees to neighboring 
countries, such as Poland and Moldova. 
The open arms of the Polish people and 
Moldovan people to their Ukrainian 
brothers and sisters is remarkable and 
a reminder to the rest of us that we do 
share common human bonds. 
Some of you may have seen the mov-
ing stories last night on ‘‘60 Minutes’’ 
of the families with their children, des-
perately trying to reach Poland, other 
countries nearby so that they can es-
cape the bonds of Vladimir Putin. 
This strategy is like nothing we have 
seen in Europe since World War II. But 
Putin’s war on Ukraine is not simply 
an attack on one young democracy; it 
is an attack on democracy itself. 
I am proud to represent the city of 
Chicago, prouder still that it is the 
home of so many immigrants who have 
made a difference in that city and in 
America, Polish immigrants and de-
scendants of Polish immigrants. Per 
capita, there is a larger number in Chi-
cago than anyplace outside of Warsaw. 
We are also home to many immi-
grants who trace their heritage to the 
Baltic States. I happen to be one who 
does as well. 
We have such a long history of 
Ukrainian immigrants coming to our 
city that there is a neighborhood in 
Chicago called Ukrainian Village. 
Last Friday, I went over to the 
Ukrainian National Museum. It is near 
their Orthodox church. I take great 
pride in it. One woman there, who is a 
Ukrainian artist, had displayed many 
of the creations she had made on the 
wall. She said to me: They are for sale, 
Senator. 
And I said: Well, I am glad to know 
that. 
And she said: All the proceeds are 
going to the Ukrainian Army. 
Naturally, I left with one under my 
arm.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1003 
March 7, 2022 
Putin’s war on Ukraine and the wave 
of refugees pouring into Poland and 
other neighboring nations hits home in 
Chicago. People from all backgrounds 
are donating money and goods—what-
ever they can—to help. 
Meest-Karpaty 
is 
a 
Chicago-area 
shipping company with experience in 
Eastern Europe. For 7 days now, the 
company’s shipping facility on the 
Northwest Side of Chicago has been an 
operations center for an incredible vol-
unteer effort to rush critical supplies 
to Ukraine. People and companies are 
dropping off supplies of first aid equip-
ment, non-perishable food, diapers, and 
basic essentials: warm clothes, sleeping 
bags, tents, flashlights. 
Scores of volunteers assemble the do-
nations into first aid kits and baby 
kits—whatever is needed. They pack 
the donations in the boxes that will be 
flown and delivered to the Polish bor-
der, where more volunteers deliver 
them to Ukrainians who need them. 
People are doing everything they can 
to support Ukraine’s fight for freedom 
and democracy. 
Andriy Herha is a banking executive 
from Oak Brook, IL, who was born in 
Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv. His dad, 
in-laws, cousins, friends—they are still 
there in Ukraine. In one day last week, 
he raised $40,000, personally, to buy 
bulletproof vests, helmets, first aid 
kits, and other supplies. When he 
learned that it would take weeks for 
the supplies to reach those who needed 
them, he decided to pack them into 
suitcases and board a flight to Poland 
and deliver them himself. As Andriy 
Herha told a reporter, ‘‘we are trying 
to do anything possible to help them.’’ 
We in this Senate must also do what 
we can to help Ukraine in its fight for 
freedom and democracy. Last week, I 
led more than 40 Senators—both par-
ties, Democrats and Republicans—in 
asking President Biden to extend tem-
porary protected status to the 75,000 
Ukrainians who are currently in the 
United States, including on student 
and work visas. On Thursday, as I knew 
he would, the President responded fa-
vorably. He is granting that protec-
tion. 
Congress should also act without 
delay to approve $10 billion this week 
in emergency aid to assist Ukraine and 
bolster our NATO allies, as well as sup-
port neighboring nations like Poland 
and Moldova that are providing safe 
havens to the refugees. 
And after listening to President 
Zelenskyy on Saturday, I thought to 
myself: How can we possibly be import-
ing Russian oil and gas, giving the 
profits of those transactions to Vladi-
mir Putin to pay for his war machine? 
I believe now—and I have cospon-
sored the legislation that reaches this 
goal—that the United States should 
ban the purchase of Russian oil to fur-
ther tighten economic pressure on 
Putin. I joined in the legislation intro-
duced by Senators Murkowski and 
Manchin to do that. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
was talking with our NATO allies. 
Many of them also seem willing to con-
sider a ban on Russian oil. 
Vladimir Putin is threatening not 
only the security of Ukraine; he is 
threatening the security of the world. 
We must not even indirectly fund his 
war machine. While Putin wages war 
on democracy, the world, including the 
United States, will likely pay more to 
fill our tanks at the gas stations and 
heat our homes. We have to be ready 
for that reality, but that is the price 
today of defending freedom and democ-
racy. The Ukrainians are paying with 
their lives. We may end up paying some 
more at the pump. 
Amid all this utterly outrageous and 
unnecessary suffering and destruction, 
all to assuage Vladimir Putin’s warped 
sense of grievance and his twisted nos-
talgia for the dark days of the Russian 
Empire, President Zelenskyy ended his 
talk with us on Saturday morning on a 
memorable note. He said we are all one 
big, undefeatable army for freedom and 
that we should all live in peace and 
openness and, despite the horrors in-
flicted on his people, we must hold on 
to our humanity. 
He was a standup comedian at one 
point. He did a movie, which was a 
spoof on someone as unlikely as him-
self being elected President. Lo and be-
hold, in the next free election, he was 
elected President of the country. 
Many people questioned whether he 
was up to the job. Boy, his detractors 
are very quiet now. This man has 
risked his life for his country, as so 
many are in Ukraine. It is time for us 
to stand behind Ukraine solidly—sol-
idly for their leadership. 
I hope this crisis ends soon. Until 
then, the United States and the rest of 
the civilized world must stand with 
Ukraine for freedom and democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
come to the Senate floor today to once 
again talk about the crisis in Ukraine 
and what we can do here to help. 
Night has fallen in Ukraine and in 
Kyiv, Kharkiv, and other cities and 
towns. All through Ukraine, the bomb-
ing continues, the bombardment—artil-
lery shells, missiles. Thousands of in-
nocent Ukrainians have already lost 
their lives. We cannot let this stand. 
We need to work with our allies to stop 
these atrocities. 
By the way, all over the country, 
people are standing up and speaking 
out. 
A week ago Sunday, I was in Ohio 
with 
a 
thousand 
people—mostly 
Ukrainians, Americans of Ukrainian 
descent, but also people from every-
place: Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slo-
venia, and so many other countries, 
and people who have been Americans 
for generations—who were standing to-
gether to say: This cannot stand. We 
had a prayer vigil and a demonstration. 
The prayer vigil was in a huge church, 
but it was an overflow crowd pouring 
out into the streets. 
Yesterday, I came to Washington to 
join such a rally. It was in front of the 
White House, and again it included so 
many Ukrainians, including from Ohio, 
but so many others as well. The ral-
lying cry was: We are all Ukrainians 
today because we all believe in democ-
racy and freedom and the right for a 
country to chart its own course and for 
people to be independent and free. We 
had rabbis there; we had ministers 
there; we had clergy there from four or 
five 
different 
denominations—again, 
praying for the people of Ukraine. 
We were all standing together, hop-
ing that through joint action, we can 
help during these dark days for the 
people of Ukraine. We prayed for pro-
tection for those in harm’s way, of 
course. We prayed for the courageous 
Ukrainian troops, some of whom are ci-
vilian soldiers who have just joined the 
armed forces for the first time. Some 
are seasoned professional soldiers, and 
we prayed for their protection—all of 
them. 
We asked for God’s wisdom and bless-
ing on the duly-elected Government of 
Ukraine—again, 
duly-elected. 
We 
prayed for strength and resolve for 
President Zelenskyy and for his protec-
tion. He has been amazing. He has been 
resolute and courageous, and he has 
shown the Ukrainian people that the 
way forward was just to stand up to 
these barbarous acts. 
If you care about America, you 
should care about Ukraine. Every free-
dom-loving country should care be-
cause in Ukraine today is where the 
fight for freedom is being waged. It is 
not just about Ukraine; it is also about 
the rest of the countries in Eastern Eu-
rope, of course—Latvia, Estonia, Lith-
uania, 
Poland, 
Romania, 
Hungary, 
those countries. But it is also about 
the entire world, isn’t it? It is about, 
can an authoritarian government step 
into a free, independent government 
and take over territory and kill its 
citizens? 
By the way, Ukraine wants nothing 
but to live in peace. They are not look-
ing to attack anybody. They just want 
to be able to lead a life where they can, 
in peace, pursue their dreams. 
Just today, during the negotiations 
between the Ukrainian Government 
and the Russian Government, the Rus-
sian Federation, the Russians said that 
they would only allow humanitarian 
corridors to go from these cities that 
they are bombing, where they are kill-
ing civilians—they would only allow 
humanitarian corridors to go into Rus-
sia or into Belarus. Think about that 
for 
a 
minute.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1004 
March 7, 2022 
are told: You can leave, but you will be 
forced to go to the land of your en-
emies. You are forced to go only to 
Belarus or Russia, the countries that 
are killing you and your family. 
That doesn’t sound like peace talks 
to me. 
There have been numerous recorded 
war crimes in this assault on Ukraine. 
One is the way they are dealing with 
these civilians, obviously. President 
Putin and his generals and his officials 
must be held accountable. The Russian 
Federation’s deliberate targeting of ci-
vilians is the most obvious example, 
but there are so many—the bombing of 
a nuclear powerplant. 
It is now documented that yester-
day—yesterday and into this morn-
ing—Russians shelled Ukrainian citi-
zens who were fleeing the siege of 
Mariupol while they were transiting 
through a negotiated humanitarian 
withdrawal corridor—a corridor that 
was established for them to escape. 
They were shelled by Russian combat 
forces—civilians—because Russians did 
not keep their word to allow for a hu-
manitarian escape corridor in the be-
sieged southern port city of Mariupol. 
Hundreds of thousands of people re-
main trapped without food and water, 
under regular bombardments. 
Again, this is a tragedy on a scale 
difficult to comprehend. That is why it 
is so important to show our support 
with actions, not just words. 
A number of my colleagues and I 
spoke to President Zelenskyy this 
weekend. It was emotional, and it was 
inspiring. He pleaded for our assistance 
to help his people, and he told us he 
needs defensive weaponry, like fighter 
planes and drones, desperately. 
After the call, I led a bipartisan let-
ter to President Biden with my col-
league from New Hampshire, Senator 
JEANNE SHAHEEN. We repeated what we 
had called for over the last several 
days, which is to help Ukraine be able 
to get what they need, which is more 
air power. 
Our Eastern European allies, includ-
ing Poland, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, 
have older, Soviet-era aircraft, such as 
the MiG–29 and the Su-25, that they are 
willing to provide to Ukraine, but they 
would like to have an agreement with 
the United States that they can back-
fill over time by purchasing advanced 
fighters, such as F–16s. 
By the way, the Poles, as an example, 
already have F–16s, but they already 
have these older MiGs that they are 
willing to provide. 
This seems like a win-win for every-
body—for Ukraine certainly but also 
for Poland to improve their defensive 
posture in the wake of what is going on 
in Ukraine. 
The Soviet aircraft are compatible 
with the Ukrainian Air Force. Their pi-
lots have the requisite training to op-
erate them. 
Again, we have been told they are 
willing to donate these aircraft when 
they are provided these assurances and 
a roadmap, that they will be allowed to 
purchase more advanced aircraft over 
time. 
Let’s make this happen. Let’s not say 
we have to go through a long, bureau-
cratic process. Let’s be creative here. 
They need these planes now. They 
needed them yesterday. This will help 
to stop some of the atrocities we 
talked about. Think of that column, 
miles and miles of armored vehicles 
and tanks heading towards Kyiv to kill 
more civilians. Some airpower would 
be very helpful right now. 
And there are other capabilities such 
as communications gear, drones that 
can provide intelligence and surveil-
lance and ammunition, all of it should 
be moving quickly into Ukraine. And I 
applaud the administration for what 
they have done, but we have got to do 
more. 
We have all seen these horrible im-
ages on our television sets, families 
torn apart, the ravages of a needless 
war, the deliberate intentional tar-
geting of civilians by rockets, even 
cluster munitions. 
By providing lethal and humani-
tarian assistance to Ukraine, the U.S. 
sends a strong message: We stand for 
freedom, and we stand with freedom- 
loving countries. 
I commend the administration for 
some of the steps they have taken, as I 
say, but we have got to do more. 
I appreciate that we have sanctioned 
Russian banks, Russian elites, placed 
limits on high-tech commerce, Russia’s 
ability to do business in dollars. That 
is all good. The Treasury Department 
has imposed sanctions on economic 
measures to target the core infrastruc-
ture of Russia and more than 50 per-
cent of the total banking system of 
Russia, which will have devastating 
economic effects over time. 
But let’s put all the banks into that 
system. Let’s do everything we can to 
tighten the noose on the Putin econ-
omy. 
Some have asked me: Why does what 
is happening in Ukraine matter? I was 
home this weekend, and a lot of posi-
tive response, but people were also say-
ing: Ukraine is a long way away, why 
does it matter so much? 
I would say that this is where, in our 
generation, in our time, the cause of 
freedom is being defended. This is 
where, in our generation, in our time, 
we must protect those who wish to 
chart their own course, protect their 
sovereign independent country. And 
this is where we are being tested—not 
just the United States, but our allies 
and all freedom-loving people around 
the world. 
When the people of Ukraine chose to 
get rid of a corrupt Russian-backed 
government 8 years ago—for a second 
time, by the way—they chose freedom 
over tyranny. They chose democracy 
over authoritarianism. They chose to 
ensure that the people of Ukraine 
would have the ability to be free and 
independent. That is what we freedom- 
loving countries of the world proclaim 
every day. 
Now is the time not to shirk our re-
sponsibilities, but to step forward and 
help any way we can shoulder to shoul-
der with the people of Ukraine. 
They are defending their homeland 
fiercely. They have already denied 
President Putin his early goals. He has 
severely underestimated the power of 
freedom and the power of the Ukrain-
ian people; there is no question about 
that. But in Congress, we can and 
should do more. And the international 
community must do more to hold Rus-
sia accountable. 
I say to the Russian commanders in 
the field and to the officials in Moscow: 
There is another choice. Stop this 
atrocity. Refuse the orders to kill inno-
cent neighbors. Stop this atrocity that 
has already taken the lives of thou-
sands 
of 
innocent 
civilians—men, 
women, and children—who want noth-
ing other than to live in peace. 
I say to those commanders and these 
officials: The world is watching. The 
war crimes are being recorded. You 
have a choice. 
Here in Congress, we can do more to 
tighten the sanctions. We can do more 
to provide more military assistance to 
Ukraine. There is bipartisan agreement 
on so much of this, including the need 
to cut off the funding that is going to 
the Putin economy and his war ma-
chine. One example of this, but one im-
portant one, is not to buy Russian oil 
and send blood money to Russia. Why 
would we be importing Russian oil, 
sending Russia $40, $50 million a day? 
That makes no sense. 
Let’s use our natural resources here 
in North America. We have the re-
sources here. We should not be depend-
ent on the Russian oil. We should not 
be sending them this blood money. 
By the way, there is bipartisan agree-
ment on this. Last week, I joined legis-
lation with Republicans and Democrats 
alike, equal number, with Senator 
MURKOWSKI and Senator MANCHIN, to 
do just that. 
We need to stop all Russian banks 
from their access to the international 
banking system—not some; all. I com-
mend the administration’s sanctioning 
of Russian oligarchs and wealthy citi-
zens, but we need to do more. We need 
to move from freezing assets to seizing 
assets. We can do that. Other countries 
have done it. By the way, Germany has 
done it. France has done it. We should 
be out front as Americans and not just 
freezing but seizing. By the way, those 
assets that we seize should go to the 
people of Ukraine to help with the hu-
manitarian effort that is underway. 
Right now, our friends in Ukraine 
need our help. Right now. Immediately. 
Yesterday. They can’t wait. We have 
an emergency supplemental bill we are 
working on here in Congress. Let’s get 
it done. Let’s do it outside of the omni-
bus or the CR or anything else. We 
know what needs to be done. Let’s not 
wait. Let’s not dither. The shells are 
flying tonight, raining upon the cities 
of Ukraine and its people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

March 7, 2022 
We cannot let this call to action go 
unanswered. We cannot let the Ukrain-
ian people continue to be at the mercy 
of a tyrannical dictator. We cannot sit 
by and watch as innocent civilians are 
being killed. In the West, in America, 
we must stand up—all of us—for free-
dom. The world is watching. Our allies 
are watching. 
Our adversaries are 
watching. 
We must show the world that Amer-
ica does stand for freedom, and we 
stand with Ukraine. 
God bless Ukraine. Or as the Ukrain-
ian people say: Glory to Ukraine, glory 
to the heroes. Slava Ukraini, heroyam 
slava. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Ala-
bama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, be-
fore I start my speech today on an-
other topic, I want to take just a mo-
ment to discuss what is on all of our 
hearts across the country and across 
the world, that we should be praying 
for the Ukrainian people. We have got 
a mess in Ukraine. 
A lot of us have been to Ukraine over 
the last few months. We have made 
friends. I went over and met with the 
President a few months ago and a lot of 
his staff—and what good people. But 
they told us then that they needed 
help. And for some reason, this admin-
istration decided to drag its feet and 
tried to talk its way out of it. 
Sometimes, when you try to talk 
your way out of it instead of putting 
facts in front of you, you have prob-
lems. Well, we have had real problems. 
President Putin, who is a murderous 
tyrant, thought this was going to be 
easy. He didn’t realize that the people 
of Ukraine were going to stand up and 
fight for their country. And they have 
done just that. They have lost many 
lives, Ukrainian soldiers, men and 
women, and also many, many citizens, 
but it has made NATO stronger. Putin 
never thought that would happen. 
So as I said earlier, I think that we 
all should remember every day and 
every night our prayers will go out to 
the Ukrainians, and, hopefully, in the 
near future, we can all come to some 
kind of consensus of what works best 
and that President Putin will come to 
his senses and call this off. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, the other thing I want 
to talk about real quickly is rising 
prices, inflation. I was back in my 
home State of Alabama this week, and 
prices are at historic highs and getting 
higher every day. But we were told by 
this administration that inflation was 
transitory. We heard that all last year. 
The definition of transitory: not for 
long. Well, they were very wrong on 
that. 
They also said inflation was due to 
COVID. Well, COVID is not gone, but it 
has died down, and inflation is getting 
higher. 
We were told by this administration 
that it was due to corporate greed. 
Well, we have had the same corpora-
tions for years and years. Inflation has 
been low, but now still going higher 
and higher. 
And the last reason that this admin-
istration said inflation is going up is 
because of war, and there is probably 
something to that. Obviously, we have 
got an energy crisis in this country, 
and everything runs off of energy. 
But one thing this administration 
didn’t tell us was they didn’t blame it 
on the trillions of dollars that we basi-
cally have taken and thrown out of hel-
icopters all over this country. We have 
got more money now, 36 percent more 
money in circulation than we had 2 
years ago in this country, and we have 
less goods. And that is when you have 
inflationary prices that creep up. 
But we have got to get control of our 
energy crisis. If we don’t do that, then 
the economy is not going to have a 
chance. That is the bottom line. That 
is the basics of the economy. Our farm-
ers are getting killed with planting as 
we speak. They are in the fields paying 
more and more every day for their fuel. 
Small businesses are struggling with 
rates that are climbing at double and 
triple the rates in terms of being 
shipped their goods, and they are hav-
ing to pay the price for that. And then 
the price goes up, and the American 
consumer pays that much more. 
So we have got a problem, and we 
better get control of that in the very 
near future, or our economy is going to 
continue to go down and continue to 
get in debt. 
So we have got those two problems, 
one at home and one on the road. It is 
a road game in Ukraine; and, hopefully, 
we can help out the Ukrainian people, 
give them what they need to continue 
to fight. But as we watch television 
each day, they continue to lose ground 
each day. But they are going to fight 
for what they believe in, and that is 
their freedom. 
DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME 
Mr. 
President, 
my 
topic 
today, 
though, is—I think it is something that 
we need to listen to from people across 
this country. It is not war. It is not in-
flation. It has something to do with 
basic life here in this country. To be 
their voice, I am advocating on the 
people’s behalf of this country. 
So let me read you a little bit about 
something that comes from my people 
in 
Alabama. 
A 
constituent 
from 
Talladega County writes: 
Daylight savings time year-round means 
the elderly, like myself, will be able to be 
more active in early evenings. 
Another from Mobile writes: 
Please try and do whatever is necessary to 
have daylight savings time permanent in the 
State of Alabama and our country. Everyone 
I know and everyone that I talk to, they 
want more daylight in the evening. 
And this is from a mental health pro-
fessional: 
I am writing to let you know of the nega-
tive effects of my population of having the 
time change the way it does in November to-
wards an earlier sundown, less daylight 
hours. It increases depression and decreases 
productivity in about half of my psychiatric 
patients. 
In other words, he is having problems 
when the sun goes down, basically be-
cause people can’t get outside. These 
messages make important points, and I 
couldn’t agree more. That is why I co-
sponsored Senator RUBIO’s bill, the 
Sunshine Protection Act, which would 
make daylight saving time permanent. 
That would mean an extra hour of sun-
light during the dark and cold winter 
months. 
And ahead of this weekend, when we 
start daylight saving time this coming 
Sunday, I want to take a moment to 
discuss the many reasons why we 
should do away with the outdated prac-
tice of springing forward and falling 
back. 
Daylight saving time should be a 
thing of the past, because it literally 
is. Introduced as a temporary measure 
during World War I, daylight saving 
time was originally called ‘‘wartime,’’ 
and it was a way to help conserve fuel 
and better utilize resources. 
Following the end of World War I, the 
1918 Standard Time Act was enacted 
that discontinued daylight saving time 
nationally, but individual States con-
tinued to spring forward and fall back. 
Then, during World War II, there was 
a renewed Federal push for full-time 
daylight saving time, which then was 
repealed in 1945. Finally, in 1966, Con-
gress passed legislation to set a na-
tional standard time. 
All this to say, changes to our clocks 
might have made sense when it first 
began, but it certainly doesn’t now. 
In fact, as recently has 2005, Congress 
moved the start of the date of daylight 
saving time 1 month earlier in the 
spring and 1 month later in the fall. 
This change was implemented in 2007, 
giving us the ratio of daylight saving 
time that we have now—8 months to 4 
months. 
The ways we consume energy have 
dramatically changed since the begin-
ning of World War I. What started as 
an energy saver now just does not 
make sense for these modern times. To 
turn the clocks back each year is a nui-
sance and not smart policy. 
You know, kids get out of school and 
the Sun is starting to set. Families in 
their kitchen are cooking dinner, and 
it seems more like a bedtime dinner. 
Weekends have less sunlight hours, 
limiting the amount of time folks of 
all ages can spend enjoying the out-
doors. 
Additionally, reduced levels of sun-
light are known to disrupt the body’s 
internal clock, which regulates sleep 
and alertness. It is no wonder that 
cases of SAD, S-A-D, or seasonal affec-
tive disorder, are much more common 
in the winter months than they are in 
the spring. 
And for our farmers, longer days 
mean more time to work in the fields 
under sunlight, which translates to a 
more profitable bottom line. 
From an economic perspective, the 
time change costs the U.S. economy an

estimated $430 million annually when 
accounting for lost productivity in the 
change of sleep. 
That is why Alabama, along with 17 
other States, have passed legislation or 
resolutions to flip the switch on this 
outdated 
practice, 
permanently 
in-
creasing our daylight hours. 
However, for the will of the States to 
be enacted, the Federal Government— 
this body, this building—has to get in-
volved. The 1966 law must be changed, 
and the Sunshine Protection Act does 
just that. 
The Sunshine Protection Act makes 
sense from a health and economic per-
spective, and it is just common sense. 
It is time we passed the Sunshine Pro-
tection Act. Let’s give Americans 
something to celebrate: longer days 
and more sunshine. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
TRIBUTE TO BEN RAY LUJA´ N 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, 
let me start off with some great news. 
When we vote later today, all of us will 
be able to say these four wonderful 
words: Senator LUJA´ N, welcome back. 
He is not on the floor right now, but, 
BEN RAY, it was great to see you back 
here in this Capitol last week. It was 
great to see you today. We have missed 
you. We are thrilled to have you back 
on the job. We admire your strength 
and your courage and your fortitude— 
your quiet strength. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, now, over the week-
end, Members from both the House and 
Senate met virtually with Ukrainian 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and 
we reemphasized Congress’s strong and 
unwavering commitment to providing 
robust and ample assistance to his 
country in this time of war. 
I told the Ukrainian President he was 
an inspiration to Americans, and I as-
sured him that his pleas for help will 
not go unanswered. 
In particular, President Zelenskyy 
made a desperate plea for getting East-
ern European countries to provide Rus-
sian-made planes to Ukraine. I strong-
ly support the President’s request, and 
yesterday I called on the administra-
tion to explore all feasible options to 
getting 
these 
fighter 
aircraft 
to 
Ukraine. These planes are very much 
needed, Ukrainian forces are familiar 
with them, and they will very much 
help in countering the Russians, espe-
cially as Putin massacres—massacres— 
civilians in Ukraine. 
Democrats and Republicans broadly 
agree that this is a necessary step 
against Russia’s illegal invasion, and 
today I reiterate my call for the ad-
ministration to explore how to ensure 
the Ukrainians have the capabilities 
they need. 
I also spoke with the administration 
yesterday and was told they are look-
ing closely at imposing a ban on Rus-
sian oil. 
Meanwhile, there are other steps 
Congress can take in the coming days 
to support the Ukrainian people. Above 
all, we must finalize a more than $12 
billion emergency aid package to be in-
cluded in the upcoming omnibus spend-
ing bill. This emergency aid will pro-
vide both humanitarian and military 
assistance for Ukraine—funding for ref-
ugees, medical supplies, emergency 
food supplies, as well as funding to sup-
port weapon transfers into Ukraine and 
help our eastern flank NATO allies. 
The clearest signal Congress can send 
to Vladimir Putin this week is passing 
a bipartisan aid package, leaving no 
doubt that the democratic nations of 
the world stand with Ukraine and 
against Putin’s deeply immoral and 
bloody war. 
And again—let me say it again. The 
quickest—the quickest—way to secure 
an emergency aid package for Ukraine 
is through the omnibus, and I believe 
both sides are close—very close—to ar-
riving at an agreement. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Now, on COVID aid, at the same 
time, there is another important mat-
ter that Congress must address in the 
spending bill: additional COVID relief 
aid, which the administration has wise-
ly urged Congress to approve. 
The Federal Government has com-
pletely exhausted all the public health 
funding approved last year as part of 
the American Rescue Plan. That means 
that to prepare for future variants, 
more Federal funding is needed now. 
Across the country, thank God, we 
have seen signs that the United States 
is 
turning 
the 
corner 
on 
COVID. 
Schools are open. Mask guidelines are 
being reversed. Vaccinations have sur-
passed 216 million Americans. And last 
Friday, we learned that more than 7 
million jobs have now been created 
since President Biden took office. This 
is all great news. Cases are falling, un-
employment is falling, and the country 
is on the right track. But experience 
has taught us that new variants can 
come back with a vengeance if—if—we 
aren’t ready. 
The administration has been clear: If 
we want schools to stay open, if we 
want to preserve as much of normal 
life as possible when another variant 
arises—and the odds are quite high 
that one will—Congress must pass ad-
ditional COVID funding now, not later. 
We have to have it ready. We have to 
have the therapeutics ready. We have 
to have the testing ready. We have to 
have the vaccines ready. We can’t wait 
2, 3 months after the variant hits to de-
bate this issue and then allocate the 
money and then production starts. 
That would be terrible for the country. 
It will be too little too late. It is far 
better to prepare now than play catch- 
up later. We should have learned our 
lesson a long time ago, but now we are, 
hopefully. 
I have been strongly urging my col-
leagues to get a deal done on COVID. 
Failure to act is not an acceptable out-
come. 
H.R. 3076 
Mr. President, another issue this 
week is postal reform. This week, the 
Senate is going to put the finishing 
touches on a bipartisan accomplish-
ment weeks, months, and, in fact, 
years in the making: comprehensive 
postal reform legislation. 
Six days a week, the U.S. Postal 
Service processes an average of 167 mil-
lion pieces of first-class mail. It em-
ploys nearly half a million people. It 
has been a fixture of our country since 
the very beginning, since Benjamin 
Franklin. But over the last decade, the 
post office has been in serious need of 
reform. Everyone knows the frustra-
tion of waiting weeks for a package to 
come in the mail. So this week, the 
Senate is finally passing legislation 
that will deliver for the post office the 
long-overdue reforms it has been wait-
ing for. 
The fact that this bill has extraor-
dinary bipartisan support is indicative 
of its importance, and I am glad that 
both sides have negotiated in good 
faith thus far. I want to particularly 
thank Chairman PETERS and Ranking 
Member PORTMAN for making sure this 
legislation has kept moving over the 
past few weeks. 
For generations, the post office has 
delivered for America, and now Con-
gress is delivering for the post office. 
By passing postal reform legislation, 
we can ensure that Americans will con-
tinue to benefit from a speedy, depend-
able, and well-run post office, just as 
we have for our entire history. 
COSTS 
Mr. President, now on costs, a few 
weeks ago, a Member of the Republican 
leadership released a platform that 
proposed raising taxes on tens of mil-
lions of Americans, focused on fanning 
the flames of division, and zeroed in on 
proposals that failed to address the big-
gest problems of our time. 
Today, a new analysis found that a 
plan like that from the junior Senator 
of Florida could raise taxes on many 
American families by more than $1,000 
in 2022 alone. Democrats don’t think 
that we should be raising taxes on 
working Americans as we recover from 
COVID. In fact, we are working to 
make 
sure 
Americans 
have 
more 
money, not less, in their pockets. 
So, today, I sent my colleagues a let-
ter outlining how Democrats will keep 
a laser focus over the next few months 
on cutting costs, building upon historic 
job growth, and finding bipartisan 
ways to help everyday Americans make 
ends meet. Democrats are the party of-
fering ideas for how to combat infla-
tion that is being felt around the world 
because of COVID. Democrats are tak-
ing aim at capping insulin prices to $35

drugs much, much cheaper. 
Democrats are working to repair sup-
ply chain bottlenecks that are hurting

And Democrats are zeroing in on poli-
cies to combat price hikes at the gro-
cery

including 
meat 
prices, 
which the President noted last week. 
This week, our caucus will hold our 
annual DPCC retreat, where we will go 
over our proposals in greater detail. I 
want to compliment Senator STABENOW 
for putting this retreat together, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues to re-
view my letter so we can all continue 
our work of lowering costs for the 
American people.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Russia’s 
brutal 
and 
unprovoked 
attack 
on 
Ukraine 
intensified 
over 
this 
last 
weekend, bringing even more death and 
destruction to the Ukrainian people 
and more uncertainty to the rest of the 
world. It appears that Russia is now 
targeting 
noncombatant 
evacuation 
routes—the latest blatant war crime 
and a clear escalation following tar-
geted attacks on civilians. 
Russian forces fired on civilians as 
they fled for their lives, killing a 
mother, her two children, and a family 
friend. Over the last couple of weeks, 
hundreds of Ukrainians have been 
killed, and countless others have been 
wounded. More than 11⁄2 million people 
have fled the country, making it the 
fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe 
since World War II. 
Through the immense suffering Rus-
sia has inflicted, the bravery and re-
solve of the Ukrainian people has 
shown bright. The world has been awe-
struck at the courage of teachers, ar-
chitects, 
grandmothers, 
Ukrainians 
from all walks of life who have taken 
up arms in defense of their democracy. 
We have all been moved by the lead-
ership of President Zelenskyy, who is 
fighting alongside of his fellow Ukrain-
ians while pleading with the rest of the 
world to take action. We have admired 
the strength of those who were forced 
to say goodbye to loved ones, abandon 
their homes, and search for safety be-
yond Ukraine’s borders. 
People around the world have rallied 
around Ukraine, offering support in 
ways big and small. Families across 
Europe are welcoming refugees into 
their homes. People around the world 
have organized fundraisers and dona-
tion drives to get food, blankets, first- 
aid kits, and other critical supplies 
into the hands of the Ukrainians. 
People all over the free world have 
cheered on and generously supported 
Ukraine at this critical moment, but 
now it is time for Congress to act. 
Since Ukraine is not a member of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
we have no legal obligation to support 
its fight against Russia, but we do have 
a moral obligation to help them defend 
themselves. 
Russia has waged an unmistakable 
war on a sovereign democracy. It has 
targeted civilian areas and brought im-
measurable destruction to Ukraine, 
and it continues to threaten further 
death and destruction outside and be-
yond Ukraine, even rattling its nuclear 
saber at the heart of Europe. 
Yes, we have a moral duty to support 
the Ukrainian people as they defend 
their sovereignty in their beloved 
country. So far, the United States has 
provided military, humanitarian, and 
economic assistance for Ukraine. These 
resources have been critical in the 
fight so far. 
The United States and our allies have 
also imposed harsh sanctions on Rus-
sia’s economy, sending its currency 
into a downward spiral. This has, no 
doubt, made life harder for the Russian 
people, with whom we have no quarrel, 
but we should continue to use every 
tool at our disposal to impose costs on 
Vladimir Putin for his aggression in 
the hope that his own people will even-
tually rise up and say ‘‘enough.’’ 
Many businesses have suspended op-
erations in Russia, inflicting even more 
economic pain on the Kremlin. I am en-
couraged by the global response so far, 
but we need to do more. 
This is a seminal moment in Amer-
ican history and in human history, 
reminiscent of events most Americans 
today only know about from their his-
tory books and wars fought by our par-
ents and grandparents. After this ex-
tended 
holiday 
from 
history, 
the 
United States must now take every 
possible step to stop this war by all 
available means. 
This week, I expect the Senate to 
vote on an emergency funding bill to 
send even more resources to the fight 
in Ukraine. The White House has re-
quested $10 billion in military and hu-
manitarian assistance, and there is 
strong bipartisan understanding that 
we need to move that quickly, as we 
just heard from the majority leader. 
The traditionally slow pace of legisla-
tion won’t cut it. 
This is a reminder of the importance 
of not only preserving but growing our 
military strength. Authoritarian lead-
ers like Putin, Kim Jong Un, President 
Xi, and Iran’s Supreme Leader are 
watching this test of the free world’s 
resolve. 
Our Democratic colleagues have con-
sistently fought to shift funds from our 
national defense to domestic programs. 
When the case of inflation is accounted 
for, President Biden’s first budget pro-
posed an actual decrease in defense 
spending. We need to turn that around, 
especially in light of recent develop-
ments. 
The war in Ukraine has proven that a 
well-funded and well-prepared military 
isn’t a luxury; it is a necessity. Ger-
many’s dramatic reversal on defense 
spending illustrates how clear this 
point has now become. Our colleagues 
on the Appropriations Committee are 
still working through the details of an 
omnibus appropriations bill, and I hope 
they are able to reach an agreement 
before the funding deadline this Fri-
day. 
While short-term bills are better 
than government shutdowns, they only 
hamper our ability to plan for the fu-
ture. Our military leadership needs a 
predictable budget in order to prepare 
for the many threats we are experi-
encing now and those that are on the 
horizon. That was true before Russia 
invaded Ukraine, and it is absolutely 
critical now. 
In a recent Washington Post op-ed, 
former Defense Secretary and CIA Di-
rector Robert Gates wrote about the 
need for ‘‘a new American strategy’’ to 
safeguard security interests. That in-
cludes predictable funding, strong alli-
ances, new technologies, and reforms 
within the Pentagon. Bureaucracy and 
redtape come with a lot of overhead, 
and those dollars would better be spent 
on advanced technologies and equip-
ment. As former Secretary Gates said, 
‘‘Our 
executive 
and 
legislative 
branches must understand the new 
world we live in, set aside business as 
usual and embrace dramatic change to 
ensure that we and our democratic al-
lies prevail in that contest.’’ 
Investments and reforms in our na-
tional defense will be critical to Amer-
ica’s security for years to come, but 
there are immediate steps we should 
take to increase the cost of this 
unprovoked war by Russia. 
The United States and our allies have 
imposed crippling sanctions on Russian 
banks and oligarchs, but the country’s 
lucrative oil and gas industry remains 
virtually untouched. Russia continues 
to export energy to the rest of the 
world. In fact, many parts of Europe 
are completely dependent on Russian 
energy exports, and Putin is happy to 
use the revenue that he generates from 
those sales to sustain the attack on 
Ukrainian civilians. 
The embarrassing truth is that the 
United States is one of Russia’s cus-
tomers. We cannot continue to supply 
Russia with the blood money they get 
from their exports to the United 
States. That is why there is strong bi-
partisan support for a ban on Russian 
oil imports. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of legis-
lation that was introduced by our 
friend from Kansas, Senator MAR-
SHALL, to ban the purchase of Russian 
oil in the United States. 
We have the great fortune of living in 
a resource-rich country, and there is no 
reason why we should rely on anyone 
else—let alone a power-hungry dic-
tator—for our basic energy needs. 
Putin’s aggression has lit a fire under 
the United States and our allies, and 
we need to take concrete steps to end 
our reliance on foreign oil and continue 
our pursuit of energy independence, at 
the same time making sure that our 
friends and allies around the world 
have access to more than just one 
choice when it comes to their energy 
needs. Again, we need to take that 
noose out of the hand of Vladimir

Putin when it comes to dissuading 
these countries that are dependent on 
Russia. We need to give them more 
choices and the freedom to make those 
choices. 
Strangely, there are media reports 
today the administration is consid-
ering easing sanctions on Venezuelan 
oil to compensate for what nations im-
port from Russia. But I have to ask, 
why on Earth would we trade one oil- 
rich dictator for another? 
Instead, here is a novel concept per-
haps the administration would con-
sider: Why don’t we boost our own pro-
duction from here in the United States 
and sell it across the globe? 
It is truly shocking that this admin-
istration is so against and so opposed 
to American oil and gas that they 
would rather make it easier to buy oil 
from the Maduro regime than from 
here at home in America. It is simply 
unfathomable and inexcusable. Energy 
security is something we have taken 
for granted here in the United States— 
so has Germany and so has Europe. But 
now they are learning that there are 
bitter lessons to be learned from that 
dependency on imports from a country 
like the Russian Federation. We simply 
cannot ignore the fact that energy se-
curity is national security, and we 
can’t ignore the grave risks that ac-
company our reliance on foreign oil for 
our most basic needs or those of our al-
lies. 
Over the last couple of weeks, people 
around the world have rallied in sup-
port of the people of Ukraine. In ways 
big and small, the global community 
has sent an unmistakable message that 
Russia’s attack on the sovereignty of 
Ukraine will not be tolerated. It is 
time for Congress to step up to the 
plate and provide even more support to 
our friends in that country. 
As I said, we may not have a legal ob-
ligation, but we do have a moral obli-
gation to supply Ukrainian forces and 
civilians with the resources they need 
in order to resist Russian aggression. 
That is the task before us this week, 
and I hope we can take strong bipar-
tisan action that sends an unmistak-
able message to the world. 
I hope we will also consider other 
more harsh actions against Russia. For 
example, I support our colleagues on 
the Finance Committee to strip Russia 
of its permanent normal trading rela-
tions status. This will place Russia in 
the same pariah category as North 
Korea and Cuba. 
The Wall Street Journal made the 
point this last week that nothing can 
be the same after the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine. There are few seminal 
points in our life where we remember 
that everything changed thereafter, 
whether it is September 11, 2001, the as-
sassination of a President, and now, 
after this post-Cold War holiday from 
history, the invasion of another democ-
racy in Europe. 
This is a watershed moment, and the 
United States must take every possible 
step to stop this war before the cost 
grows even higher and spreads to other 
countries outside of Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
I would suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IOWA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
Saturday, 
deadly 
tornadoes 
swept 
through 
Iowa, 
destroying 
homes, 
parks, and leaving over 10,000 people 
without power. 
The communities most affected are 
Winterset, IA, and Chariton, IA, but 
other communities as well. Tragically, 
seven people—five adults and two chil-
dren—died, and many people have been 
affected because of this severe weather. 
This is the deadliest tornado in our 
State in 15 years. The one 15 years ago 
came close to my hometown of New 
Hartford, IA, and the adjoining com-
munity of Parkersburg, IA, and 13 peo-
ple lost their lives that time. 
So, with today’s incident, as families, 
businesses, and communities continue 
to assess the damage and clean up from 
these storms, I want Iowans to know 
that I have talked to the Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security’s 
Secretary 
Mayorkas about these tornadoes. He 
has been assuring that wherever the 
Federal Government has authority to 
help, they will step in and do that. I 
have also reached out to FEMA, the 
State of Iowa, and affected commu-
nities. I will do everything I can at the 
Federal level to assist. 
Unfortunately, Iowa is no stranger to 
tornadoes and natural disasters. Once 
again, I am encouraged by the stories I 
hear from neighbors of strangers help-
ing each other and their communities. 
Of course, we all know that that is the 
Iowa way: neighbor helping neighbor. 
These storms take time to recover, and 
I know that we will continue to reach 
out and help our fellow Iowans in need. 
My thoughts and the thoughts of all 
Iowans and their prayers go out to 
those who lost loved ones and to those 
whose properties were affected by these 
tornadoes. I also pray for those who 
were hurt and for some who were hos-
pitalized in that they will have speedy 
recoveries. 
Iowans are strong and resilient peo-
ple. We will recover, and we will re-
build. As Iowa’s Senator, I will be there 
to help in any way needed. 
FREE SPEECH 
Now, Mr. President, another matter 
that I have spoken of on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate recently and, to some 
extent, a few times last year is the 
issue of freedom of speech in our col-
leges. In recent years, I have tried to 
highlight some of the most ridiculous 
impositions on freedom of speech in 
college, but so many of these cases get 
swept under the rug. 
It can be hard to get an idea of 
whether typical students feel free to 
speak their minds in the university en-
vironment. So last spring, the Iowa 
legislature passed a bill strengthening 
free speech across our State’s edu-
cation system. In part, this bill was 
meant to find out how big a problem 
the restraint of free expression is at 
our State’s public universities. Last 
month, that led to the results of a sur-
vey of 17,000 students in Iowa’s public 
universities. The results raised serious 
concerns. 
Now, get this: Fewer than half of the 
employees thought that their univer-
sities allowed them to say what they 
believed. A third of the students 
thought 
that 
their 
institutions 
‘‘hinder[ed] free speech.’’ A quarter of 
the students didn’t even think that 
their campuses provided an ‘‘environ-
ment for [the] free and open expression 
of ideas.’’ 
A university that can’t meet that 
basic bar is missing the whole purpose 
of a college or university. You have 
heard me say my definition of a ‘‘uni-
versity’’ is one wherein controversy 
ought to run rampant. Thankfully, the 
bill that passed the Iowa legislature 
takes action to solve the issue that I 
just described. 
This semester, students across the 
State have begun taking a course to in-
still in them the value of free speech. 
The goal is to ensure that students and 
faculty understand the value of the 
First Amendment: freedom of speech. 
The course emphasizes respect for an-
other’s speech and its impact both in 
and out of the classroom. 
I am hopeful that this will start to 
steer us in the right direction in not 
only my State of Iowa; I hope it has 
some impact across the country, be-
cause letting students speak their 
minds is central to the idea of a liberal 
arts education. Yet the default has in-
creasingly become to censor at the 
drop of a hat, only allowing free speech 
if administrators find blowback. 
Just look to a case last month here 
in Washington, DC, at George Wash-
ington University. A student put up 
posters criticizing having the Olympics 
in China, given the repressive regime 
there. We know about that repressive 
regime because we talk about it quite 
often as the Chinese Communists deny 
freedom of religion and other freedoms 
to the Uighur minority. These posters 
at George Washington University were 
well done and well within the main-
stream discussion. They speak to the 
concerns that I have myself about what 
goes on in China. 
The 
university 
immediately 
re-
sponded by tearing them down and say-
ing the posters were racist. They only 
reversed themselves when it came out 
that the artist himself—I had better 
say himself or herself—was Chinese and 
that 
the 
concerns 
were 
far 
from 
unique. I find it hard to believe the 
university’s namesake would approve 
of this approach.

Examples like this are why we need 
Iowa’s new free speech course. Hope-
fully, this example set in my State by 
our own State legislators is followed 
elsewhere. Students and administra-
tors alike have forgotten why the First 
Amendment matters. I am glad to see 
States like Iowa are starting to remind 
everybody. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, like most of my colleagues, I 
spent the weekend monitoring the war 
in Ukraine. I took the opportunity to 
join the video conference with Presi-
dent Zelenskyy. I don’t know how any-
one could have hung up from that call 
confused about Vladimir Putin’s inten-
tions with Ukraine. Indeed, I think we 
saw that Vladimir Putin has ill intent 
for anyone who opposes him. 
What is happening in Ukraine is not 
a ‘‘special military operation,’’ as 
Putin likes to say; it is an all-out war. 
Putin has caused a massive humani-
tarian and human rights crisis, and 
even though the world is collapsing 
around him, he has given no indication 
of pulling back. 
The sanctions imposed by the free 
world have had a devastating impact 
on Russia’s economy. The ruble just 
crashed to a record low. The United 
States just instituted a ban on Russian 
flights over our airspace. Sports orga-
nizations, entertainers, and private 
corporations are all avoiding Russia 
like the plague. 
If Putin’s goal was to transform Rus-
sia into another ‘‘hermit kingdom,’’ he 
is well on his way to making that 
dream a reality. The very idea seems 
insane, but remember, Vladimir Putin 
may be a madman, but he is a madman 
who is very intentional in what he is 
doing. He is reading the terrain, and he 
sees that the world’s foremost super-
power is too busy worrying about op-
tics to do the one thing that would 
send Russia’s economy back to the 
stone age. 
Putin 
sent 
his 
army 
to 
invade 
Ukraine on February 24. The Ukrainian 
people have endured 11 days of sav-
agery, and we still have not imposed 
meaningful sanctions on the Russian 
energy sector. But now, the entire 
world knows that Putin is using energy 
as a weapon. 
Russia is now the U.S.’s third largest 
supplier of crude oil. The European 
Union gets about 40 percent of its gas 
imports and more than a quarter of its 
oil from Russia. We are feeling the pain 
every time we put gas in our cars, but 
looking at oil prices is still a bright 
spot in Putin’s day. 
Russia is really a great big oil depot 
with an army, and he knows that much 
of the world is depending on Russian 
oil. He is financing his war with every 
single tank of U.S. gas at a time. Every 
time you pull up to fill up your tank, 
this is what is happening. As long as 
Joe Biden refuses to tear us free from 
our entanglement with Russian energy, 
he is complicit with every single barrel 
of oil that he buys. 
Energy is the most powerful eco-
nomic weapon that Putin has at his 
disposal. It is his currency. The only 
way to neutralize it is to cut off the 
revenue stream. We must sanction the 
Russian energy sector, and we must do 
it now. We must end the purchasing of 
Russian oil. It is important to our 
partners in Ukraine and to our own Na-
tion’s security. 
Last year, Joe Biden made the uni-
lateral decision to destroy energy inde-
pendence in the United States when he 
canceled the Keystone Pipeline and 
banned new oil and gas leases on Fed-
eral land—that is right. 
Colleagues, in January 2021, we were 
energy independent. We were a net ex-
porter 
of 
energy. 
But 
Joe 
Biden 
changed all that. He decided that by 
Executive order—not by a vote of the 
House or the Senate but by Executive 
order—he was going to end energy 
independence. So where does that put 
us? It has placed us right into the 
hands of a warmonger who is hellbent 
on recreating the U.S.S.R. And his 
weapon, No. 1 weapon, is energy. He 
does indeed think he has got you over 
the barrel. 
Our energy sector needs certainty, 
not a series of actions based on the 
President’s political whims, and we 
should give them that certainty by al-
lowing us to move to energy independ-
ence. 
I implore the President to see reason 
and to end this dangerously foolish en-
tanglement with Moscow and Russian 
oil. 
On that note, I think it should be 
made clear to everybody that the an-
swer is not to go to Venezuela and ne-
gotiate to buy Venezuelan oil from an-
other madman, and the answer is not 
to have the Russians working as an 
intermediary on a new Iran nuclear 
deal, which, by the way, the people of 
this country do not want to be entan-
gled with Iran. 
By the way, we hear they are negoti-
ating to buy Iranian oil. This is about 
the dumbest damn thing I have ever 
heard of. It is amazing. You are going 
to go do business with Venezuela and 
with Iran and have the Russians in-
volved in the middle of that? This is as-
tounding. 
This weekend, as I talked to Ten-
nesseans, they could not believe that 
this administration would be stooping 
to such. 
Sanction Russian energy. Restart the 
Keystone Pipeline. Open up capped 
wells. Stop flaring natural gas. Put it 
into the supply chain. Make certain 
that you are drilling domestically, ex-
ploring domestically. Do it before it is 
too late. 
Our mission as Americans has not 
changed. We have a duty to preserve 
and protect freedom. The sheer avail-
ability of live footage and photographs 
flowing out of Ukraine has highlighted 
the importance of that mission to pro-
tect and preserve security. 
This isn’t the first time that Putin 
has invaded sovereign territory, but it 
is the first time that his crimes have 
been live-streamed for the entire world 
to see. 
And as far as the free world is con-
cerned, most of us have correctly iden-
tified the villain, but there are more 
than a few people out there who need 
persuading, and it is our job to help 
keep the information flowing. 
Early on in the war, Putin launched 
cyber attacks to destabilize Ukraine 
and prevent communications with the 
outside world. Through my work on the 
Armed Services Committee, I have sup-
ported funding for domestic programs 
that would help protect State and local 
governments here in the United States 
from these types of attacks. 
In the fiscal year 2022 NDAA, we cre-
ated the Civilian Cyber Security Re-
serve Program to make sure that our 
Federal Government can keep up with 
cyber threats like the ones from Mos-
cow being launched at the Ukrainians, 
but when it comes to defending free-
dom, shoring up our own defenses is 
not enough. We have to look outward 
and prevent the kinds of vulnerabilities 
Putin is trying to create. 
Last week, I introduced the Internet 
Freedom and Operations Act with my 
colleague Senator MENENDEZ. This leg-
islation builds off of the work we did 
together on the Open Technology Fund 
Authorization Act. It would authorize 
more than $100 million to support pro-
grams and circumvention technologies 
that keep the internet up and running 
in conflict zones and under other re-
pressive media environments. We have 
successfully used this technology to 
put control over information back in 
the hands of the people, right where it 
belongs. 
Dictators like Putin suppress dissent 
for a reason. The truth is that free 
speech scares them to death. They 
don’t want it. They want cancel cul-
ture—only one point of view, and it is 
theirs. 
From where I am sitting, it is clear 
that Putin is right to be fearful of the 
resistance in Ukraine and around the 
world and especially in his own coun-
try, as his citizens are taking to the 
streets—thousands 
protesting, 
thou-
sands being arrested—so that they can 
push forward with freedom in their 
countries. 
I would encourage my colleagues to 
support 
the 
freedom 
fighters 
in 
Ukraine and elsewhere, support them 
by signing on to the INFO Act. Again, 
I thank Senator MENENDEZ
for his 
work on that. 
We have talked a lot lately about 
sanctions and Stingers and ammuni-
tion, but I would argue that what has

rattled Putin the most is how power-
less he is to stop people from speaking. 
As I mentioned earlier, his war crimes 
are being broadcast in real time to 
anybody who has a screen and an inter-
net connection. 
Russian citizens are protesting in the 
streets against the Russian Govern-
ment. His struggling military is the 
subject of intense ridicule on every dig-
ital platform. It is a propagandist’s 
worst nightmare and the source of im-
mense hope for the Ukrainian people. 
And—God bless them—they are in the 
fight. 
We have a duty to help keep that 
hope alive, and I would encourage my 
colleagues who haven’t yet realized 
this to join together this week to stand 
up for the people in Ukraine, to stand 
up for energy independence in this 
country, and to stand up for free 
speech. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
H.R. 3076 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor today to talk 
about Postal Service reform. We have 
another vote this afternoon. 
And this is incredibly important to 
the people I represent and whom all of 
us represent. It is important because 
the Postal Service is something people 
depend on for so much. This legislation 
we are talking about has been in the 
works for years. It is a bill to try to 
save the post office from insolvency. 
And if we don’t act on this, I believe in 
the next few years we will be back here 
with a big bailout for the Postal Serv-
ice because they are having a tough 
time financially. 
The combination of this legislation 
that we will pass and some internal re-
forms that the post office is making 
should be enough to get the post office 
back on track. 
The Postal Service has a Postmaster 
General right now who is absolutely 
committed to that—making the post 
office more effective, more efficient— 
but he needs a little breathing room, as 
he says, and that is what we are doing 
here in Congress. It doesn’t cost the 
taxpayer anything. By the way, if we 
don’t do this, in a few years, it would 
cost the taxpayers a lot in terms of a 
bailout, and I am afraid it would hap-
pen. 
The post office, again, is so impor-
tant. It is definitely worth saving. Our 
country is pretty divided right now— 
let’s be honest—but one enduring re-
ality about our country is that we have 
a post office that ties us all together, 
and everybody depends on that post of-
fice. 
By the way, it has been that way for 
a long time. In 1775, 3 months after the 
battles of Lexington and Concord—so 
this is 1775, before the Revolution was 
finalized in 1776. During that time, the 
delegates to the Second Continental 
Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin 
as the Postmaster General. And why 
was this so important? Franklin was 
one of the Founding Fathers, and this 
was considered to be a really crucial 
post because the new Postal Service of-
fered a way for the colonists to talk to 
each other, to communicate, for Revo-
lutionary 
leaders 
to 
be 
able 
to 
strategize with each other outside of 
the official British channels. 
So the post office has that rich his-
tory, and it continues to bind us today. 
In Ohio, it ensures that veterans get 
their 
medications 
that 
they 
get 
through the mail. And believe me, that 
is important to them, to get it on time. 
It allows for absentee voters. In Ohio 
we have no-fault absentee. We have had 
it for years. It works well, but it re-
quires the post office to do its job and 
obviously to not just deliver the absen-
tee forms but to get the ballots in on 
time. 
It is also crucial for people to get 
their rent checks in or to be sure that 
they get their utility bill on time. It is 
for people’s financial statements from 
their banks. But, also, the post office 
still delivers birthday cards, thank-you 
notes, 
and 
personal 
letters 
that 
strengthen the bonds of family and 
friendship. So our Postal Service binds 
us together at a time when we are in-
creasingly polarized. 
Let’s talk about what this particular 
legislation does. How does it save the 
post office? First, very simply, the bill 
makes sure the post office is going to 
be on a strong footing for the future by 
relieving the Postal Service of an obli-
gation that virtually nobody else has— 
nobody in the Federal Government— 
which is to prefund retiree health bene-
fits. 
Now, if you are in a private company 
and you are listening to this, I am al-
most sure you don’t prefund your re-
tirement healthcare benefits. People 
don’t do that. In the Federal Govern-
ment, we don’t do that. We don’t do it 
here in Congress. Yet the post office 
has that obligation. 
This would allow the post office, by 
getting out from under that obligation, 
to reconcile its books more accurately 
and to focus on immediate obligations. 
They should focus on those immediate 
obligations but not the prefunding. 
Second, this bill requires postal em-
ployees who retire in the future to en-
roll in Medicare Part B and Part D. So 
hospitalization, Part A, people are al-
ready signed up for that—everybody is. 
But for Part B and Part D—doctors’ 
visits, prescription drugs—about 25 per-
cent of the people who work for the 
post office are not signed up for that. 
And by putting that 25 percent into 
there, it helps to save a lot of money 
for the post office and the taxpayers. 
Taxpayers will save about $1.5 billion 
based on this legislation, and a lot of it 
is because of that change. The em-
ployee health benefit plan that they 
would otherwise be in is a more gen-
erous plan, and that is how you get 
those savings. 
Third, the bill requires the post office 
to maintain its current standard of 6- 
day delivery. That is important to a lot 
of my constituents, particularly in the 
rural areas—they like getting their 
mail—and to do it through an inte-
grated delivery system of mail and 
packages together. That, of course, 
makes sense. You don’t want separate 
systems going out for packages and for 
mail. That is what they do now, so this 
is really just restating the status quo, 
and that is very important. For some 
of the private-sector companies that 
provide delivery services, they want to 
know that this is just the status quo; 
we are not talking about any changes. 
Both sides of the aisle have talked to 
me about this 6-day delivery. I know 
that wherever people have a rural area 
in their State, this is particularly im-
portant. It ensures that people are 
going to receive their medications, 
their checks, their correspondence on a 
timely and predictable basis. 
So this bill shores up the post office, 
and it does it in a way that actually 
saves money. The nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates, as I 
said, this legislation will save tax-
payers $1.5 billion, so it doesn’t cost 
taxpayers anything. It is not the ap-
propriation of more money, but over 10 
years it saves that money. 
CBO, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, which is the nonpartisan body up 
here that looks at the economic impact 
of legislation, has told us recently that 
this bill will not affect the solvency of 
the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust 
Fund. That is the trust fund we talk 
about a lot here that we are concerned 
that it is going to become insolvent in 
only a short number of years and that 
that is going to cause problems for 
Medicare. That trust fund is not 
touched by this legislation. 
CBO has also made it clear that the 
bill will not increase Part B or Part D 
premiums—again, Part B, doctors’ vis-
its; Part D, prescription drugs. That is 
very important because a lot of people 
have concerns about that. And one rea-
son it doesn’t affect it, by the way, is 
there is only a small number of postal 
employees—only 25 percent of them— 
who would become part of that, so it is 
a drop in the bucket compared to the 
number of people on Medicare. There 
are probably 60-some million people— 
that would be 61, 62 million people in 
Medicare, and this is between 14,000 
and maybe 80,000 people who would be 
added to Part B and Part D. So it does 
not affect the premiums. By the way, 
these people have been paying into 
Medicare for their whole career, so it is 
appropriate that they go into Part B 
and Part D. 
This is a good bill, and I think that is 
why it passed the House with such a 
strong vote. It passed with a bipartisan 
vote in the House of 342 to 92. That 
rarely happens, particularly in the 
House of Representatives. So that is an 
indication of what kind of legislation 
this is. 
It is popular because it is about sav-
ing the post office, and it is popular be-
cause it does so without asking the 
taxpayers to step up and do more. In

fact, it saves some money. And it is 
popular because we have worked to-
gether on this. We have each side made 
concessions. Is it the perfect bill that I 
would have written? No. The same as 
my colleague from Michigan, who has 
just arrived on the Democratic side. He 
would have written it differently in a 
number of respects. I know that be-
cause he had to make concessions; we 
had to make concessions. But we ended 
up with legislation that does the job, 
and that is what is important: to put 
the post office in a position to succeed 
in its critical mission to provide essen-
tial services to small businesses, to our 
veterans, to our seniors, to our rural 
constituents. 
Let’s pass this bill, and let’s ensure 
the post office is healthy for all those 
folks we represent back home. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I may 
speak 5 minutes prior to the com-
mencement of the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, in 
just a few moments, this body will take 
an important vote to continue moving 
forward on the bipartisan Postal Serv-
ice Reform Act. These vital reforms 
will help set the Postal Service on a 
more stable financial footing so that 
this trusted public service can continue 
delivering to every single community 
in the United States. 
Millions—millions—of Americans are 
counting on the Postal Service to de-
liver essential mail, including medica-
tions, important financial documents, 
and other critical supplies. We have all 
seen firsthand how veterans and sen-
iors, small businesses, rural residents, 
and others who rely on the Postal 
Service face serious hardships when the 
Postal Service is focused on cutting 
costs by making changes to delivery 
service. 
This bill will help address the most 
significant financial burdens on the 
Postal Service by reversing an unnec-
essary requirement to prefund every 
cent of healthcare benefits that every 
postal employee will eventually use in 
retirement no matter how far off that 
retirement may be. By eliminating this 
aggressive prefunding requirement—I 
may add, something that no other busi-
ness in America is forced to do—along 
with 
integrating 
postal 
retirees’ 
healthcare into Medicare, like so many 
other private employers, this bipar-
tisan, commonsense legislation will 
save the Postal Service more than $49 
billion over the next 10 years. 
The bill also requires the Postal 
Service to deliver 6 days a week and 
improves transparency and account-
ability for Americans by requiring the 
Postal Service to publicly post weekly 
performance data on its website. 
This legislation has been 15 years in 
the making, and tonight, we will get 
one step closer to making it a reality. 
I am grateful to my colleagues who 
have shown strong, bipartisan support 
for 
this 
legislation, 
including 
my 
colead, 
Ranking 
Member 
PORTMAN 
from Ohio, and the 28 cosponsors from 
both sides of the aisle who have worked 
with us to make this a reality. Our co-
sponsors have played an important role 
in helping to build additional support 
for this critical bill. 
Certainly, there is still more work to 
do to ensure even greater long-term 
success for the Postal Service and its 
customers, but tonight—tonight—the 
Senate will take a substantial step to 
continue advancing this incredibly im-
portant bill. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
taking this meaningful action to pro-
tect the future of the Postal Service 
and the essential services that it pro-
vides to our communities all across our 
country. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING PAUL FARMER 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last 
month, the world lost one of its great 
champions for public health, Dr. Paul 
Farmer. 
Few people did as much to save lives 
around the world as Paul. He was a 
giant. He changed how the world 
thinks about international aid and 
about public health. Millions of people, 
from Haiti to Peru, to Russia, to Rwan-
da, are living longer, healthier, more 
fulfilling lives because of Paul Farmer 
and because of the movement he 
launched. 
Paul moved to Haiti immediately 
after graduating from college. He had a 
special relationship with that country 
for the rest of his life. It is where he 
met his wife Didi Bertrand—a school 
principal and preacher’s daughter in 
Cange. Even during Harvard Medical 
School, Paul would fly back and forth 
to Haiti, setting up his own clinic and 
an expanding network of community 
health facilities. 
In 1987, he and my friend Jim Yong 
Kim and their two colleagues, Ophelia 
Dahl and Todd McCormack, founded 
Partners in Health. They founded Part-
ners in Health on Paul’s radical idea, 
and it is a radical idea in so many 
ways; that all human beings, regardless 
of who they are and where they live, 
deserve 
equal 
dignity 
and 
equal 
healthcare. 
In 2003, the very good writer Tracy 
Kidder wrote a book about Paul and his

life: ‘‘Mountains Beyond Mountains.’’ 
After Paul’s death, Tracy wrote a trib-
ute to him and titled it ‘‘He Wanted to 
Make the Whole World His Patient,’’ 
and he really did. 
I met Paul on a trip to Haiti with my 
friend Joanne Carter, the executive di-
rector of RESULTS, which is a grass-
roots organization dedicated to ending 
the cause of poverty around the world. 
It was in April 2003. Partners in Health 
was working in Haiti, and the hospital 
and clinic Paul started in Cange had 
grown to a broad network around the 
country. Paul and his colleagues were 
working with community health work-
ers to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis 
and to scale up AIDS treatment in the 
most impoverished place, by far, in the 
Western Hemisphere at a time when 
there was almost no antiviral treat-
ment available in poor countries. 
People claim that treating patients 
and getting antivirals out in countries 
like Haiti was just impossible. Paul 
proved them wrong. Partners in Health 
invited several hundred U.S. policy-
makers, journalists, and Members of 
Congress, over time, to Haiti to see 
firsthand how they were expanding ac-
cess to lifesaving treatment. At the 
time, there was still a popular senti-
ment, even among health workers, that 
we couldn’t do this; that it was impos-
sible to get these antiviral treatments 
out on any kind of large scale in low- 
income countries. It was a trans-
formational moment. Paul opened the 
world’s eyes to what was possible. 
We could and had to treat patients 
everywhere. The barrier wasn’t that it 
couldn’t be done; it was that no one 
had made it a priority. No one in rich 
countries like ours or in even middle- 
income countries wanted to or really 
had tried to make this a priority. 
I remember we met a young man in a 
wheelchair in a hospital unit. I was 
with Paul. He was caring for this young 
man. He had tuberculosis of the spine. 
It is called Pott’s disease. It is when 
tuberculosis bacteria migrates into the 
spinal column and causes paralysis. He 
was getting treatment that no one 
would have thought possible before 
Paul. We met HIV/AIDS patients and 
saw how antiviral treatments were 
transforming their lives. People called 
it the Lazarus effect. In a relatively 
short amount of time, this treatment 
revived them and brought them back 
from the brink. 
Late at night, we sat around to-
gether, at Paul’s little house in Cange, 
and talked about what would come 
next and what we needed to do to rouse 
the world to action. It was an exciting 
time. A global fund had just been cre-
ated. Paul’s ideas were gaining trac-
tion. Paul Farmer brought such a 
moral clarity to all of these conversa-
tions. Whether it was talking to policy-
makers or to public health experts or 
to community leaders or to his pa-
tients—his 
impoverished 
patients 
often—he began every discussion with 
the same fundamental principle: Ev-
eryone 
has 
the 
right 
to 
quality 
healthcare. 
Rather than have a technical con-
versation, he would look at all of these 
health experts and leaders when they 
would say, ‘‘Unfortunately, there are 
just not enough resources to treat ev-
eryone, so we have to make choices,’’ 
and Paul would say, ‘‘When we make 
these choices, we are always talking 
about somebody else’s children.’’ He 
didn’t say it in an accusatory way; he 
wasn’t judgmental; and he didn’t look 
down on anybody. It was simply how he 
thought about it and how he wanted 
everyone to think about it. 
The other thing that always struck 
me and that was so astonishing about 
Paul is that he cared so much about 
each individual person. He had uncom-
mon and maybe even unparalleled em-
pathy. He had an absolute commitment 
to his patients’ care. He was a big 
thinker in change policy, but he was a 
practitioner up close who took care of 
fellow human beings. He had an abso-
lute commitment to his patients’ care 
literally right up until the moment of 
his death. He was talking about pa-
tients he was treating in Rwanda, and 
he was giving advice right up until the 
day he died. 
Tracy Kidder reported that Paul had 
been up late the night before, seeing 
patients. Mr. Kidder said, in his experi-
ence with Paul, that being up late and 
seeing patients was the equivalent of a 
night on the town. 
Over the past few weeks since we lost 
Paul, a remembrance of that empathy 
has poured out from people around the 
world—from former students and col-
leagues, patients, world leaders, public 
health luminaries. Everyone has a 
story about Paul Farmer’s dedication 
to humankind and to his patients indi-
vidually. They agree that Paul really 
did change the world. His legacy will 
certainly inspire many of us in this 
body. More importantly, it will inspire 
people around the world. 
When I think of Paul Farmer, I think 
of one of my favorite passages in the 
Gospel, Matthew 25. We are all familiar 
with 
it—Christians, 
certainly—but 
nonbelievers, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, 
and Muslims, I think know this pas-
sage from Jesus. 
Jesus said: When I was hungry, you 
fed me. When I was thirsty, you gave 
me drink. When I was in prison, you 
visited me. What you did to the least of 
these you did to me. 
I thought, you know, that doesn’t 
quite sound right, ‘‘What you did to the 
least of these,’’ because I cannot be-
lieve that Muhammad or Buddha or 
Jesus or Maimonides or Moses would 
think that MARK KELLY is worth more 
or less than another human being. All 
of us in God’s eyes are equal. 
So I came across a friend of ours who 
lives down the street—a pastor—and 
she gave to me a Bible called the ‘‘Jus-
tice and Poverty Bible.’’ 
It say this in Matthew 25: When I was 
hungry, you fed me. When I was 
thirsty, you gave me drink. When I was 
in prison, you visited me. What you did 
to those who seemed less important 
you did for me—not what you did for 
the least of these but what you did for 
those who seemed less important. 
That was how Paul Farmer lived his 
life. He understood that no human 
being was worth less than anyone else; 
that everyone is deserving of compas-
sionate healthcare; and that everyone 
is deserving, as Rumi said, of gen-
erosity and helping others: Be like a 
river in compassion and grace. Be like 
the Sun. That is the way Paul looked 
at the world. 
Our thoughts are with his family and 
his patients around the world. Let’s re-
commit ourselves to following the ex-
ample of Dr. Paul Farmer.

EMMETT TILL ANTILYNCHING ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 55, which was received 
from the House and is at the desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 55) to amend section 249 of title 
18, United States Code, to specify lynching 
as a hate crime act. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 55) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just 
want to go over what just happened. 
After more than 200 failed attempts 
to outlaw lynching, Congress is finally 
succeeding in taking the long-overdue 
action by passing the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act. Hallelujah. It is long 
overdue. 
The first anti-lynching legislation 
was introduced a century ago, and 
after so long, the Senate has now fi-
nally addressed one of the most shame-
ful elements of this Nation’s past by 
making lynching a Federal crime. That 
it took so long is a stain—a bitter 
stain—on America. 
While this will not erase the horrific 
injustices to which tens of thousands of 
African Americans have been subjected 
over the generations—nor fully heal 
the terror inflicted on countless oth-
ers—it is an important step forward as 
we continue the work of confronting 
our Nation’s past in pursuit of a bright-
er and more just future. 
I want to applaud the work of the 
legislation’s sponsors. Senator BOOKER 
has been relentless to get this done and 
deserves tremendous credit, as does his 
colleague on the Republican side of the 
aisle, Senator SCOTT, and, of course,

ment to strike all after the enacting

following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

this title. 
‘‘(2) An individual described in this para-

enactment of this Act. 
(c) PLOT ALLOWANCES.—Section 2303 of title 
38, United States Code, is amended—

(2) by adding at the end the following new 
subsection: 
‘‘(e) In this section, the terms ‘tribal organi-

NATIONAL WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask

proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 
537, submitted earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

A resolution (S. Res. 537) designating 
March 2022 as ‘‘National Women’s History 
Month.’’ 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in honor of Women’s History 
Month to recognize the extraordinary 
achievements of past generations of 
women and to pay tribute to the vital 
role they have played in the political, 
economic, and social development of 
this Nation. 
Women’s History Month provides a 
special opportunity to reflect upon the 
numerous 
contributions 
made 
by 
women who touch all aspects of our so-
ciety—from government, to business, 
the arts and sciences, the military, and 
much more. I look upon the courage 
our predecessors displayed with great 
admiration, and I continue to be in-
spired by those who blazed the trail for 
women like me. 
I am reminded of how incredibly 
proud I was to see the Smithsonian 
Women’s History Museum Act, which I 
coled with Senator Susan Collins, en-
acted in December 2020. This law estab-
lishes a long-overdue, permanent mu-
seum to collect, study, and create pro-
grams that celebrate the contributions 
and experiences of women. The Wom-
en’s History Museum will be estab-
lished on or near the National Mall,

However, it is with sadness that the

Roe v. Wade case; authors bell hooks,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1014 
March 7, 2022 
Motown vocalists Mary Wilson and 
Wanda Young. Although these icons 
are no longer with us, their contribu-
tions will live on, and their accom-
plishments have shattered glass ceil-
ings for future generations of women. 
May we honor their work and memory 
with a commitment to empower and 
support future women leaders. 
But the future is bright. In the 117th 
Congress, we have reached a new high- 
water mark for women in politics, as 
more women are now serving in elected 
office than ever before. There are now 
148 women serving in Congress: 124 
women in the House of Representatives 
and 24 women in the U.S. Senate. Just 
last year, the Senate confirmed Janet 
Yellen to be the first female Treasury 
Secretary. Just recently, President 
Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson to be the Nation’s first Black 
woman as a Supreme Court Justice. 
These are exciting times for women 
indeed, and much progress has been 
made. Yet we still have a lot of work 
cut out for us. We must come together 
to 
address 
the 
ongoing 
pandemic, 
which 
has 
had 
devastating 
con-
sequences for the health of our country 
and economy. The pandemic has also 
uniquely harmed women and girls—es-
pecially women of color. A dispropor-
tionate number of women have lost 
their jobs as a result of the pandemic 
and are often unable to maintain work 
commitments with children learning 
from home while schools are closed. 
This unequal harm endured by women 
during the pandemic reminds us that 
the march toward equality is yet to be 
done. We must continue our work to 
ensure fairness and equity for women 
everywhere. 
As we convene to celebrate Women’s 
History Month, I ask my colleagues to 
celebrate with me how far we have 
come and to continue the fight for the 
progress of all women—especially those 
who are struggling during these trying 
times. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 537) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 3757 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand that there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the 
second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3757) to prohibit the importation 
of crude oil, petroleum, petroleum products, 
liquefied natural gas, and coal from the Rus-
sian Federation. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar, under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

MORNING BUSINESS 
SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today on behalf of myself and Senator 
CRAPO to express grave concern with 
the vulnerability of supply chains and 
the long-term implications if we do not 
act now to develop a secure supply 
chain of critical minerals. In light of 
the aggression shown by our adver-
saries, supply chain security is more 
important than ever. 
Our Nation is at a crossroads; Russia 
has invaded Ukraine. At the same 
time, China continues to use economic 
coercion to control global markets and 
shape countries’ political decisions. 
With Congress’ support, this adminis-
tration must take drastic and targeted 
measures to ensure our Nation takes 
the right path to advance U.S. com-
petitiveness and maintain a strong po-
sition in domestic and foreign markets, 
including critical minerals production. 
Critical minerals are vital to the 
emerging technologies that will under-
pin the future economic well-being and 
prosperity of this Nation. In recogni-
tion 
of 
these 
important 
minerals, 
under President Trump, the Depart-
ment of the Interior developed a list of 
35 critical minerals, a process that 
Congress later codified. That list, just 
last week, expanded to 50. Our home 
State of Idaho is rich in many of these 
minerals—some of which are funda-
mental to energy and national security 
applications—such as antimony and co-
balt. 
Antimony and cobalt serve as critical 
components in grid storage batteries 
and other electrification implements 
essential to providing reliable energy 
sources to American homes and busi-
nesses. In addition to its energy con-
tribution, antimony serves as a critical 
component 
of 
ammunition, 
arma-
ments, and other national security 
platforms. Although these minerals 
serve as essential components in highly 
utilized U.S. products, 53 percent of an-
timony comes from China, and another 
23 percent comes from Russia. Most co-
balt is sourced from the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo—DRC—where 
the Chinese Government has subsidized 
companies that engage in nontrans-
parent practices, dominate the indus-
try, and undermine the prosperity and 
rights of the Congolese. 
Aside from mineral production, Idaho 
is responsible for cutting-edge mineral 
research. We are proud to be the home 
of the Idaho National Lab, the Nation’s 
premier nuclear energy laboratory, 
whose research is paramount to any fu-
ture clean energy strategy. Unfortu-
nately, the Biden administration chose 
to remove uranium from the critical 
minerals list, which leaves the Nation’s 
nuclear fleet even more reliant on Rus-
sian fuel. 
As tensions rise with Russia and the 
potential of additional sanctions loom, 
China will look to take advantage of 
the void left by Russia’s isolation in 
the market. While we need to take 
strong actions on Russia, the reality is 
that we source many of our raw min-
erals from them. As we tighten our 
grip on their financial system and ex-
ports, we must prioritize domestic 
sourcing and reduce our reliance on 
countries like Russia and China. 
The time is now for this administra-
tion to take real action to prioritize a 
strong domestic supply chain for these 
essential minerals. We do not want to 
compromise any of our environmental 
or other standards. We are simply call-
ing on the administration to prioritize 
the timely completion of the permits 
of currently proposed projects so we 
may take back control of a funda-
mental piece of many of our essential 
industries: critical minerals produc-
tion.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING HELEN SELIG 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service 
of former Hot Springs mayor Helen 
Selig. 
Selig was a beloved member of the 
Hot Springs community and made a 
substantial difference in the lives of so 
many Arkansans. She not only served 
as mayor of Hot Springs from 1994–2000, 
but also played a crucial role in ful-
filling countless projects aimed at 
bettering the city. 
As mayor, Selig saw great success 
throughout her 6-year tenure, and it 
was something that was recognized by 
citizens and leaders alike. Hot Springs 
city manager Bill Burrough reflected 
that, ‘‘Hot Springs is truly a better 
place because of her passion, the work 
that she did, and her influence. When 
Helen Selig was involved, people would 
listen.’’ 
Selig has been praised widely for her 
involvement in a variety of community 
projects, including the construction of 
the convention center. In the recent 
weeks, dozens of local leaders have 
been outspoken in their praise and 
gratitude for her dedication to Hot 
Springs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1015 
March 7, 2022 
In 1992, Selig was already making 
waves as a well-known leader of a 
group advocating for Hot Springs to be 
chosen as the location for the Arkansas 
School for Mathematics, Science, and 
the Arts. This school did end up being 
located in the so-called Spa City and 
has helped so many students with 
bright minds flourish throughout our 
State. 
Her lifetime of service to her commu-
nity and neighbors extended far beyond 
her time as an elected leader. She was 
a founding member of the Arkansas 
Women’s Leadership Forum, as well as 
the Women’s Foundation of Arkansas, 
in addition to volunteering for several 
organizations, including Habitat for 
Humanity, Hot Springs Parks Board of 
Directors, R.E.G.A.R.D., YMCA Board 
of Directors, Hot Springs Music Fes-
tival—board of directors—Kappa Kappa 
Gamma fraternity, Catholic Church of 
St. John the Baptist, the Lotus Book 
Club, and Hot Springs National Park 
Rotary Club. Time and time again, 
Helen Selig exhibited her firm commit-
ment to the people of Hot Springs. 
I am so grateful for Mayor Selig’s 
dedication to serving her community 
and truly making a difference in the 
lives of those around her. I want to 
take this time to pray for her family in 
their time of grief and reassure them 
that Helen’s memory will live on 
through the great work she has done 
for Arkansas.∑

REMEMBERING ART BROWN 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, along 
with 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
Mike 
Crapo, I rise today to recognize Arthur 
Brown, a long-time resident of Idaho, a 
wonderful citizen, and a tremendous 
contributor to Idaho. Art died on Feb-
ruary 9, 2022, having lived a full, rich 
and meaningful life. 
Art was born October 27, 1940, in Ger-
miston, South Africa, the eldest of 
three children. Art attended school in 
Germiston and went on to study at 
Witwatersrand 
Technical 
Institute, 
earning a mining engineering degree. 
Soon after graduating, he left his 
homeland to work for the Cementation 
Company in Nelson, British Columbia, 
Canada in 1962. It was in Nelson where 
he met Tiia, an immigrant from Esto-
nia, and the woman who would become 
his wife. Together, Art and Tiia had 
three daughters, Lisa, Hayley, and 
Laura. 
Art arrived in Wallace, ID, in June of 
1967, where he became an industrial en-
gineer for Hecla Mining Company. He 
worked hard and was eventually pro-
moted to mine superintendent at the 
Lucky Friday Mine. While living in the 
beautiful Silver Valley, Art thoroughly 
enjoyed the outdoors, often taking his 
family skiing and camping. Art, Tiia, 
and their two daughters who were born 
in Canada celebrated becoming U.S. 
citizens in 1972. 
Art ascended the ranks at Hecla, be-
coming president in 1986, the same year 
the company moved its headquarters to 
Coeur d’Alene, ID. Art reached the pin-
nacle of his career when he was made 
Hecla’s CEO and chairman of the 
board. In 2003, Art retired from Hecla, 
marking the end of a remarkable ca-
reer that spanned four decades. 
An accomplished businessman and 
corporate leader, Art was also a dedi-
cated family man, making time to 
travel and support his daughters at ski 
races, 
basketball 
games, 
tennis 
matches, and horse shows. And ever 
the proud grandfather, he supported his 
four grandchildren at football, basket-
ball and baseball games, cross-country 
meets, golf tournaments, and soccer 
matches. 
Art shared his enthusiasm for life 
with everyone he knew and was always 
willing to listen and help solve prob-
lems. He was genuinely interested in 
the people he met and was loved by 
many. Art will be missed, but not for-
gotten. 
We are proud to have known Art 
Brown, for the example he set for busi-
ness, for the contributions he made in 
his community, and for the way he 
loved and supported his family. On be-
half of so many in our great State, we 
honor Art Brown today and express our 
heartfelt thanks to him for a lifetime 
of service to others.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. 
CASEY, Mr. COONS, Mr. BOOKER, 
Mr. MENENDEZ, and Mr. SCHU-
MER): 
S. 3767. A bill to amend the Water In-
frastructure Improvements for the Na-
tion Act to reauthorize Delaware River 
Basin conservation programs, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to introduce, along with 
the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. 
CASEY, the Junior Senator from Dela-
ware, Mr. COONS, the Senator from New 
Jersey, Mr. BOOKER, the Senator from 
New Jersey, Mr. MENENDEZ, and the 
Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, 
the Delaware River Basin Conservation 
Reauthorization Act of 2022. 
The Delaware River Basin Conserva-
tion Act became law as part of the 
Water Infrastructure Improvements for 
the Nation Act of 2016. This legislation, 
which I was proud to lead, responded to 
the need for Federal, State, and local 
governments and regional partners to 
come together to identify, prioritize, 
and implement restoration activities 
within the Delaware River Basin. The 
legislation also created a nonregula-
tory grant program for which appro-
priations have flowed through the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service. The National 
Fish and Wildlife Foundation has done 
an excellent job of working with the 
Fish and Wildlife Service to administer 
the Delaware Watershed Conservation 
Fund under the authority of this act. 
In just a few short years, this pro-
gram has grown tremendously. To 
date, the Delaware Watershed Con-
servation Fund has awarded more than 
$25 million to projects that support 
recreation, water quality, water man-
agement, and habitat. Grantees have 
matched that investment by a ratio of 
nearly 2 to 1—an impressive total con-
servation impact of over $70 million. 
This program is a great example of 
how when the government—at all lev-
els—works with diverse suites of non-
government 
stakeholders, 
we 
can 
achieve meaningful results on the 
ground that improve the lives of people 
and wildlife alike. 
For example, the program has funded 
several diverse projects in Delaware, 
including installing pollinator gardens 
at places of worship, removing a dam 
in White Clay Creek, improving fish 
passage in the Brandywine River, and 
restoring wetlands at our national 
wildlife refuges. These restoration ef-
forts protect the species we love, clean 
up our drinking water, and provide a 
boost to local tourism. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today would reauthorize the Delaware 
River Basin Conservation Act and 
make some minor improvements to 
allow even better results on the ground 
throughout the Delaware River Water-
shed. This reauthorization has clear 
benefits for our environment and econ-
omy—a win-win for Delaware and our 
region. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact this important leg-
islation this Congress. I ask unanimous 
consent that a copy of the bill I am in-
troducing today appear in the Record 
following my statement. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3767 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
COLLINS, Mr. COONS, and Mrs. 
SHAHEEN): 
S. 3769. A bill to amend the Energy 
Conservation and Production Act to 
improve the weatherization assistance 
program, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing the Weatherization Assist-
ance 
Program 
Improvements 
Act, 
which will make critical updates to en-
sure this important program can effec-
tively serve even more households 
across the country. 
Since 1976, the Weatherization As-
sistance Program has helped more than 
7 million low-income families reduce 
their energy bills by making their 
homes more energy efficient. The De-
partment of Energy estimates that 
these upgrades help each household 
save $283 in energy bills annually. 
Those energy savings free up limited fi-
nancial resources for essentials, like 
groceries and medicine. 
In addition to traditional services 
like attic and wall insulation, the pro-
gram also provides services that help 
with home health and safety measures, 
such as installing smoke and carbon 
monoxide detectors. Energy efficient 
homes also help cut down on our car-
bon footprint, reducing the greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
that 
cause 
climate 
change. 
An independent study of the Weath-
erization Assistance Program by Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory found that 
children 
in 
weatherized 
households 
miss 
less 
school, 
improving 
edu-
cational outcomes. Adults miss less 
work, increasing both their own in-
comes and their contributions to the 
economy. Families also reported expe-
riencing fewer flu and cold symptoms 
and emergency room visits, decreasing 
costly medical expenses. 
The Weatherization Assistance Pro-
gram also helps boost our economy. 
The program supports over 8,500 jobs 
for energy experts and contractors, 
while increasing our national economic 
output by $1.2 billion. 
The program is a win-win for all in-
volved. That is why, as a member of 
the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
I have led my colleagues in supporting 
strong funding for it every year. And 
that is why I am introducing this bill— 
to ensure it continues to work for 
years to come. 
This bill, which is cosponsored by 
Senators COLLINS, COONS, and SHAHEEN, 
will help expand the program to many 
more low-income households that are 
currently unable to receive weatheriza-
tion services because their homes are 
not structurally sound. The bill will 
authorize a Weatherization Readiness 
Fund, providing $65 million a year for 5 
years to repair structural issues and 
prepare homes for weatherization as-
sistance, increasing the number of 
homes the program is able to serve. 
At the same time, it will raise the 
amount of funding allowed to be spent 
on each home to keep up with current 
labor and material costs, and it will 
raise the cap on the amount of funding 
allowed to be spent on renewable en-
ergy upgrades in each home. These pro-
visions are essential updates to a pro-
gram that has helped so many families 
over the past few decades. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in 
supporting this commonsense legisla-
tion. 
By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. 
HASSAN, Mr. HAGERTY, and Mr. 
KING): 
S. 3771. A bill to prohibit United 
States persons from engaging in trans-
actions with foreign persons that pur-
chase or transact in gold from the Rus-
sian Federation; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. CORNYN. President, I ask unani-
mous consent to print my bill for in-
troduction 
in 
the 
Congressional 
Record. The bill prohibits U.S. persons 
from engaging in transactions with for-
eign persons who purchase or transact 
in gold from the Russian Federation. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Rus-

PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
PRESIDENT 
VLADIMIR 
PUTIN 
IS 
A 
WAR 
CRIMINAL 
Mr. CASSIDY (for himself and Ms. 
HASSAN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 536 
Whereas, under international law, a war 
crime is a serious violation of the laws or 
customs of war as defined by international 
customary law and international treaties; 
Whereas war crimes also include initiating 
a war of aggression as prosecuted at the Nur-
emberg trials following World War II and 
more recently defined in the 2010 amend-
ments to the Rome Statute of the Inter-
national Criminal Court; 
Whereas a war criminal is a person who 
has planned, ordered, or carried out an act 
during the conduct of a war that violates ac-
cepted international rules of war; and 
Whereas Articles 26 and 27 of the Vienna 
Convention on the Law of Treaties, done at 
Vienna May 23, 1969, state, ‘‘Every treaty in 
force is binding upon the parties to it and 
must be performed by them in good faith. 
. . . A party may not invoke the provisions 
of its internal law as justification for its fail-
ure to perform a treaty.’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) President Vladimir Putin of the Rus-
sian Federation has committed war crimes 
as defined by the United Nations, the Inter-
national Criminal Court, and other inter-
national bodies by— 
(A) initiating an unprovoked war; 
(B) violating the sovereignty of Ukraine 
repeatedly; 
(C) targeting civilian infrastructure, in-
cluding hospitals, schools, and apartment 
buildings, militarily; 
(D) targeting government facilities unre-
lated to legitimate military objectives; and 
(E) attempting to overthrow the democrat-
ically elected government led by President 
Volodymyr Zelensky; and 
(2) since President Vladimir Putin is the 
Commander in Chief (equivalent) of the 
Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and 
as such was involved in the planning of the 
invasion of Ukraine, he is culpable of launch-
ing a war of aggression and the systematic 
commission of war crimes during that war 
by Russian troops.

which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 537 
Whereas National Women’s History Month 
recognizes and spreads awareness of the im-
portance of women in the history of the 
United States; 
Whereas, throughout the history of the 
United States, whether in the home, in the 
workplace, in schools, in the courts, or dur-
ing wartime, women have fought for them-
selves, their families, and all people of the 
United States; 
Whereas, even from the early days of the 
history of the United States, Abigail Adams 
urged her husband to ‘‘Remember the La-
dies’’ when representatives met for the Con-
tinental Congress in 1776; 
Whereas women were particularly impor-
tant in the establishment of early chari-
table, philanthropic, and cultural institu-
tions in the United States; 
Whereas women led the efforts to secure 
suffrage and equal opportunities for women, 
and also served in the abolitionist move-
ment, the emancipation movement, labor 
movements, civil rights movements, and 
other causes to create a more fair and just 
society for all; 
Whereas suffragists wrote, marched, were 
arrested, 
and 
ultimately 
succeeded 
in 
achieving— 
(1) the ratification of the 19th Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States, 
which provides, ‘‘The right of citizens of the 
United States to vote shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by any 
State on account of sex’’; and 
(2) the enactment of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), which ex-
tended the protection of the right to vote to 
women of color and language minorities; 
Whereas women have been and continue to 
be leaders in the forefront of social change 
efforts, business, science, government, math, 
art, literature, music, film, athletics, and 
other fields; 
Whereas women now represent approxi-
mately half of the workforce of the United 
States; 
Whereas women once were routinely barred 
from attending medical schools in the 
United States, but now are enrolling in med-
ical schools in the United States at higher 
numbers than men; 
Whereas women previously were turned 
away from law school, but now represent ap-
proximately half of law students in the 
United States; 
Whereas, since the American Revolution, 
women have been vital to the mission of the 
Armed Forces, with more than 200,000 women 
serving on active duty and 2,000,000 women 
veterans representing every branch of serv-
ice; 
Whereas more than 10,000,000 women own 
businesses in the United States; 
Whereas Jeannette Rankin of Montana was 
the first woman elected to the House of Rep-
resentatives in 1916 and Hattie Wyatt Cara-
way of Arkansas was the first woman elected 
to the United States Senate in 1932; 
Whereas Margaret Chase Smith of Maine 
was the first woman to serve in both Houses 
of Congress; 
Whereas, in 2022, a record total of 148 
women are serving in Congress, including 124 
women in the House of Representatives and 
24 women in the Senate; 
Whereas President Jimmy Carter recog-
nized March 2 through March 8, 1980, as ‘‘Na-
tional Women’s History Week’’; 
Whereas, in 1987, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators introduced the first joint resolution to

Whereas, in 1987, President Ronald Reagan

Smithsonian American Women’s History Mu-
seum Act (20 U.S.C. 80t et seq.) to establish

and 
Whereas, despite the advancements of 
women in the United States, much remains 
to be done to ensure that women realize 
their full potential as equal members of soci-

it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

NAVAEH SENA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Navaeh Sena 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Navaeh Sena is a student at Arvada West 
High School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Navaeh 
Sena is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Navaeh Sena for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF PFC MICHAEL VANCIL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Private First Class Michael 
Vancil, a native of Detroit, Michigan on what 
would be his 75th Birthday. He was killed in 
action during the Vietnam War, and his serv-
ice to our nation and his ultimate sacrifice is 
worthy of commendation. 
Michael Vancil was born to Warren and 
Socorro Vancil on March 11, 1947, in Detroit, 
Michigan. Growing up he spent time at home 
in Detroit with his loving siblings David, Arthur, 
Joseph, Bruce, and Nina. A gifted fisherman, 
he could often be found fishing around South-
east Michigan and dancing with friends around 
town. At age 17, he heard the call of his coun-
try and decided to join the fight. He enlisted in 
the United States Marine Corps on October 7, 
1964, joining Company C, 1st Battalion, 4th 
Marines, 3rd Marine Division (Rein) FMF. 
During his deployment, he was assigned to 
patrol the Thu`ra Thieˆn Hue´ province, providing 
defense in a vital area of South Vietnam. On 
June 17, 1966, near Route 546 and Highway 
1, CAC 7 Alpha lay in their ambush site pro-
viding essential defense. The Viet Cong 
opened fire on the Marine patrolmen and Pri-
vate First Class Vancil was killed by hostile 
rifle fire at age 19. 
Private First Class Vancil is buried at Mount 
Olivet Cemetery in his hometown of Detroit, 
Michigan. His memory is enshrined forever at 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, 
D.C. where his name is listed at Panel 8E, 
Line 59. He is also enshrined at the Veterans 
Memorial Wall at the John D. Dingell, VA 
Medical Center in Detroit, Michigan that hon-
ors City of Detroit residents who lost their lives 
in combat. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of Private 
First Class Michael Vancil for his invaluable 
service to this nation. He showed courage and 
patriotism at such a young age, and his sac-
rifice has never been forgotten. Private First 
Class Vancil gave his all. We are grateful for 
his honorable service and know that his leg-
acy lives on through his loving family and 
friends.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF THE ROBERT R. TUCK VET-
ERANS OF FOREIGN WARS POST 
912 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the centennial of the Robert R. Tuck 
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 912 in 
Baytown, Texas. 
VFW Post 912 was first organized on March 
9, 1922, by Fred E. Simpson, John L. Bartlett, 
and Grover K. Edge. This Post, the second 
oldest VFW post in Texas, was named in 
honor of the first Baytown citizen killed in ac-
tion during World War I, Robert R. Tuck. Their 
initial meetings were held in tents and build-
ings owned by the then-Humble Oil and Refin-
ing Company. The oil industry was flourishing 
across the region, and many veterans moved 
there to work following World War I. The Post 
has had many outstanding commanders over 
the years. One such individual was George L. 
Kenne, a member who served as the Post 
Commander in 1937. He was the second most 
decorated soldier in World War I. 
In July of 1941, almost two decades after 
being organized, the Post finally established 
its first permanent location. They began 
hosting fundraisers consisting of dances and 
raffles with fifty-cent admission per civilian and 
a quarter per service member. This tradition 
would continue to the present day. 
The Post moved one more time before set-
tling into its current location in 1977. After re-
ceiving significant flood damage from Hurri-
cane Harvey in 2017, the Post used reserve 
funds and fundraiser revenue to resume oper-
ations within just six months. 
Over the last century, the locations and 
members of VFW Post 912 have changed, but 
their mission to serve the needs of veterans 
and their families has not. They have hosted 
fundraisers and been a part of many important 
programs throughout the years, such as the 
VFW Buddy Poppy program, which aids dis-
abled and disadvantaged veterans. The red 
poppy flowers assembled within the program 
symbolize the bloodshed in World War I and 
are given out before Memorial Day each year. 
The Post also hosts ‘‘turkey shoot’’ fund-
raisers in which its members and community 
supporters shoot at targets to win frozen tur-
keys, hams, or bacon. 
VFW Post 912 has been a steadfast servant 
of the Baytown community. Along with a local 
Boy Scout troop, Post members would raise 
the American flag at local football games be-
fore the Junior ROTC took over the duty in 
1979. Today, members ensure flags are 
placed on the graves of local veterans for Me-
morial Day. Over the decades, the Post has 
sponsored a baseball team, a local Boy Scout 
Troop, a beauty pageant, a marble tour-
nament, a Voice of Democracy contest, a writ-
ing contest for high school students, and a 
bowling team. They have also given out nu-
merous scholarships to local high school stu-
dents and entertained patients at Houston’s 
Michael E. DeBakey Veteran Affairs Medical 
Center. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratu-
late the members of the Robert R. Tuck, VFW 
Post 912 on their centennial and thank them 
for their unwavering service to their nation and 
community. May God continue to bless our 
veterans and Post 912 for many years to 
come.

RECOGNIZING THE 65TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
GHANA’S 
INDEPEND-
ENCE 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, the United States of America is home to 
hundreds and thousands of people of Gha-
naian heritage—including those who were 
born on this soil to those whose family emi-
grated here for education, job, or economic 
opportunities—for the American dream. 
Ghanaian Americans are an important fabric 
in the tapestry of America from the cab driver 
to the medical doctor. You will find them in all 
parts of the country from Milwaukee to New 
York to suburban Ohio and Massachusetts. 
The culture is hard to ignore with rich food, 
the iconic Akan Kente cloth, storytelling, inven-
tions, architecture and music. 
Today more than ever Ghanaians living in 
the United States worry about racial injustice, 
home ownership, access to education, access 
to small business and immigration support. 
Like many Americans, the Ghanaian com-
munity in America is not exempt from the 
COVID–19 crisis. Ghanaian Americans are es-
sential workers and are very active in the 
health care industry, especially as nurses, per-
sonal care aides, and nursing assistants. Gha-
naians are included in the 27.5 percent of all 
Black immigrant workers in the U.S.—more 
than 750,000—who work in the healthcare 
sector. Additionally, essential workers include 
frontline workers in other key industries like 
food and service & hospitality and leisure. 
And Ghanaian Americans have been con-
tributing to the success and business con-
tinuity of important industries during these dire 
times. Ghanaian Americans are included in 23 
percent of immigrants in the U.S. who work in 
the food and service industry, as well as 20 
percent of immigrants in the U.S. who work in 
hospitality and leisure. 
On this day, I recognize the 65th anniver-
sary of Ghana’s independence and my inten-
tion to launch the Congressional Ghana Cau-
cus that will create an inclusive platform in this 
body for discussing critical policy issues affect-
ing Ghanaians in the Diaspora, as well as bol-
ster the relationship between the U.S. and 
Ghana.

RECOGNIZING SILVERDALE CHAM-
BER OF COMMERCE’S MILITARY 
APPRECIATION DAY 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take a moment to commemorate Military 
Appreciation Day in Kitsap County organized 
by the Silverdale Chamber of Commerce on 
March 5, 2022. 
Here in Kitsap County, we have a lot to be 
thankful for. Kitsap County has a vibrant his-
tory as a military community. This rich history 
began in September 1891, when 190 acres of 
the Pacific Northwest wilderness was pur-
chased for the first Naval Station Puget Sound 
in Bremerton, Washington. Today, this pres-
ence has grown to include Naval Base 
Kitsap—Bangor and Naval Base Kitsap Brem-
erton and Naval Underseas Warfare Center, 
Keyport. 
Part of what makes this area special is not 
just the physical presence of our Naval Base, 
but the tens of thousands of military members 
and veterans who call it home. Members of 
the military aren’t just fighting for the freedom 
of our community. They are family members, 
friends, and neighbors who are making a dif-
ference in it, too. 
In addition to those serving in uniform, our 
community is home to thousands of Depart-
ment of Defense civilian employees who serve 
our country each day and ensure the readi-
ness and safety of our service members. 
Veterans and service members are also a 
critical part of our local economy, doing every-
thing from creating small businesses to bring-
ing their unique work ethic and skills to em-
ployers looking to fill jobs. That’s why today is 
a great way to go beyond saying thanks and 
turning our words into deeds. And that is why 
events like today’s Military Appreciation Day 
are so important. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the Silverdale 
Chamber of Commerce and the Military Affairs 
Committee for hosting Military Appreciation 
Day to honor those that do and those that 
have served our nation.

HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, during the 
early days of the pandemic, when medical re-
sources and household items were in short 
supply, Suavecito, Inc., the Santa Ana-based 
company famous for making hair pomade, de-
cided to start producing much-needed hand 
sanitizer for frontline workers in our commu-
nity. 
For months, Suavecito donated thousands 
of bottles of hand sanitizer to first responders, 
postal workers, grocery store employees, and 
delivery drivers, filling a critical need for Santa 
Ana and Orange County. 
Like so many people across this country— 
when their community was in need—Suavecito 
answered the call. Even when their own pro-
duction lines shut down, they used their re-
sources to help their community. 
Today, Suavecito has rebounded, and its 
two production warehouses are staffed by 
more than 100 employees who, last year, pro-
duced more than 6 million 4–ounce cans of 
pomade, as well as other haircare products 
and merchandise that are sold locally and ex-
ported to more than 55 markets around the 
world. 
For their distinguished contribution to U.S. 
exports during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Suavecito earned the President’s ‘‘E’’ Award 
from the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
Suavecito founders, Pete and Tony Adame 
and Jason Venable, have been a beacon of 
hope, prosperity, and resiliency in Santa Ana 
for more than a decade. This band of brothers 
represent the best of Orange County, of Cali-
fornia, and of America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CLIFTON 
N. WEST, JR. OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
ask the House of Representatives to recog-
nize Clifton N. West, Jr., an accomplished 
business owner who served the residents of 
the District of Columbia. 
Clifton N. West, Jr., ‘‘Skeeter’’ was born on 
December 12, 1933, to Thaddenia West and 
Clifton N. West, Sr. and was the younger 
brother of Pat and Beverly. He was raised by 
his mother and his grandparents in Arlington, 
Virginia. 
In 1952, Skeeter graduated from Dunbar 
High School in the District of Columbia. During 
his time at Dunbar, he served in the Reserve 
Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). He won 
many awards with the drill team and the track 
team. 
Skeeter enrolled in Howard University in 
1952 as a chemistry major. In 1955, he left 
college and joined the Air Force. He served 
for three years at the Chateauroux Air Force 
base in France. After his discharge, in 1958, 
he used the GI Bill to continue his education 
at Howard University and worked part-time at 
the U.S. Postal Service. 
He would go on to work at St. Elizabeths 
Hospital and later at NASA’s Goddard Space 
Flight Center as a medical technologist. In 
1963, he started a laboratory in his basement 
and worked on building his business in the 
evenings while he worked for Berkley Medical 
Instruments selling blood analyzers during the 
day.

March 7, 2022 
In 1971, he founded B & W STAT Labora-
tory, Inc. on the corner of Georgia Avenue and 
Irving Street NW in the District of Columbia. 
His business remains in operation 62 years 
later. The laboratory was one of the first inde-
pendent commercial laboratories in the United 
States and has served as a faithful business 
anchor for Georgia Avenue ever since, serv-
icing, hiring and training local residents. The 
company has won numerous specimen-testing 
contracts and, in 1971, was the first laboratory 
in the country to install and operate an on-site 
lab in the D.C. courthouse. The program re-
ceived network television recognition and 
served as a model for similar programs 
throughout the country. 
Skeeter founded the Georgia Avenue Busi-
ness Association, was co-founder of the DC 
Drug Prevention Partnership, and his business 
has participated in the Mayor’s Summer Youth 
Employment Program. The DC Drug Preven-
tion Partnership was established to address 
and curb drug use in D.C.’s Ward 1. Skeeter 
served as the President of the Lower Georgia 
Avenue Business and Professional Associa-
tion. During his tenure as President of B & W 
STAT, Skeeter and his business received 
many community service awards, including 
Outstanding Businessman from the People’s 
Involvement Corporation: recognition from the 
Department of Employment Services—Out-
standing Service; and Commanders of the 
Rite, Mason of the District of Columbia—Ex-
cellence in Science Services—Long Years of 
Leadership in the Field of Laboratory Testing. 
B & W STAT has been and continues to be 
a committed community partner. 
Throughout the years, B & W STAT had of-
fices on Independence Avenue, Georgia Ave-
nue and Rhode Island Avenue, had multiple 
contracts with the military, local hospitals and 
doctor offices and at one time employed over 
100 people. B & W STAT was a well-known 
laboratory, and if you got married in D.C., the 
required serology premarital blood test to re-
ceive a blue card was performed at B & W 
STAT from the 1970s to the early 2000s. 
Skeeter was sure to greet everyone who got 
married in D.C. 
He trained local residents through intern-
ships and the summer program and helped re-
habilitate many D.C. residents. He streamlined 
toxicology testing and was featured both on 
the television news and in the paper. He 
trained hundreds of military personnel on test-
ing and did not request payment for such 
training. 
Skeeter faced many small business issues, 
including dealing with banks and lines of cred-
it, but more importantly, dealt with prejudice 
while performing very technical work. B & W 
STAT always helped the D.C. government 
with issues around drug testing and helped 
when they got behind on testing by turning 
work around in 24 hours. He worked long 
hours, starting at 6:00 a.m. and ending after 
6:00 p.m. 
B & W STAT was a member of the Howard 
University Bison Express, which provides fi-
nancial assistance to Howard University stu-
dent-athletes and supported Howard Univer-
sity athletics initiatives, for many years. The 
company also raised money to replace equip-
ment stolen from Howard University. 
Skeeter loved to travel and take family va-
cations. He encouraged both of his children to 
attend Howard University and continue the tra-
dition of Historically Black Colleges and Uni-
versities. Both attended and graduated from 
Howard University. 
He is survived by his loving and devoted 
wife of 62 years, Carole Smith West; his son, 
Clifton N. West, III, ‘‘Skip’’; his daughter, Ali-
son West Hughes; his son-in-law, Michael An-
thony Hughes; three grandchildren and his sis-
ters, Raquel ‘‘Pat’’ Hall and Beverly W. 
Goode. 
He was loved by many and will surely be 
missed. His spirit and personality touched ev-
eryone he met. His love and spirit will be re-
membered by all.

Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Lucian T. Pera, a Memphis 
lawyer and specialist in legal ethics and media 
law, who has just been named the winner of 
this year’s American Bar Association Michael 
Franck Professional Responsibility Award. The

the late director of the State Bar of Michigan 
and long-time champion of improvements in 
lawyer regulation in the public interest. Mr. 
Pera, a partner in the Memphis office of the 
law firm Adams and Reese and a former 
President of the Tennessee Bar Association, 
has written extensively on ethics issues, in-
cluding in a column for the magazine of the 
ABA’s Law Practice Division. He has recently 
served as Chairman of the ABA’s Center for 
Professional Responsibility, and has served as 
the ABA’s Treasurer, on its House of Dele-
gates, and as a member of the Board of Gov-
ernors. He is recognized nationally for his 
work on ethics in the legal profession as well 
as media law and transparency issues in gov-
ernment, particularly in Tennessee, where he 
also served as President of the Tennessee 
Open Government Coalition. A graduate of 
Princeton University and Vanderbilt University 
Law School, Pera will receive the Franck 
award at a ceremony in Baltimore on June 3. 
Mr. Pera is an outstanding lawyer and up-
standing citizen, and I commend him for re-
ceiving this prestigious award.

IN MEMORY OF FRED WILLIAM 
PATTERSON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Fred Patterson. 
To those close to Fred, he was known as a 
man with two careers. While his career as an 
advertising salesman and publisher paid the 
bills, he was passionate about impacting his 
community. It is through his hard work and 
leadership that Denton transformed into a cos-
mopolitan competitor with Dallas and Fort 
Worth. 
On December 25, 1929, Fred was born in 
Decatur, Texas not too far from our beloved 
community of Denton. After graduating from 
the University of Texas in 1952, he eventually 
moved to Denton, where he joined the sales 
service department at Moore Business Forms. 
In 1958, he began work advertising for the 
Denton Record-Chronicle and that same year 
he married the love of his life, Patsy. By 1986, 
Fred and Patsy were the co-owners of the 
Record Chronicle. 
Throughout 
the 
1990s, 
the 
Pattersons 
oversaw the renovation for the Patterson-Ap-
pleton Arts Center. Personally, I am grateful 
for this facility because it provided the space 
I needed in August of 2009, to hold my largest 
townhall to-date. 
Fred very much appreciated the arts and 
history. So much so that he raised over 
$500,000 to move and restore the Bayless- 
Selby house Museum to the Denton County 
Historical Park he was also instrumental in 
founding. Beyond his love for the arts and his-
tory, Fred loved his community. He served as 
chair of the committee that established Den-
ton’s television Channel 2 and was vice presi-
dent of the Friends of WRR radio station. 
Denton was more than where he and Patsy 
lived and raised their two sons Bill and Riley. 
It was his home, and service to his community 
was truly his second career.

moved with her family to Suffield from the 
next-door town of Enfield at the age of 10. 
After graduating from Our Lady of The Angels 
Academy, Patricia remained in Eastern Con-
necticut where she went on to achieve her 
bachelor’s degree from University of Con-
necticut. It was during her time at the Univer-
sity of Connecticut where she also met and 
then married the love of her life, David Pinney. 
Upon achieving her bachelors in 1973, Pat im-
mediately picked up a career teaching in En-
field. A true reflection of her character, how-
ever, Pat eventually placed her passion for 
teaching on pause and departed the Enfield 
school system so that she could raise their 
four children: Leigh, Rob, Matthew and Nora. 
Having built out her family’s roots, Pat re-
commenced her legacy as a renowned teach-
er at Hall Memorial School in Willington, Con-
necticut. Providing students with a sense of 
the world in which they live, it was Patricia’s 
mission to provide the next generation with the 
tools they needed to succeed within their re-
spective community. Patricia was a truly nat-
ural educator, armed with a keen ability to 
keep her students engaged. She acted as the 
regional coordinator for History Day, encour-
aging students to represent Northeast Con-
necticut on the national stage during the His-
tory Day Competition in Washington, D.C. A 
strong finalist for the Connecticut Teacher of 
the Year and recipient of the University of 
Connecticut’s NEAG School of Education Out-
standing School Educator Award, Pat’s career 
as an educator was defined by excellence. 
Madam Speaker, Patricia was known for her 
generous spirit. Whether in the classroom, at 
home, or out in the community, she invested 
tremendously in everyone who she met. As a 
mother and educator, she truly had the growth 
of the next generation at heart. Her absence 
will be felt sorely in the Eastern Connecticut 
community. Though we mourn this terrible 
loss, we find gratitude in the ripple effect 
caused by the strength of her character. There 
is literally an army of people out there to oper-
ate as the standard bearers of her memory, 
namely, her husband, David, and family-in-law 
of over 50 years, their four children and fami-
lies, and her five siblings. To that end, I ask 
my colleagues in the House to join me in hon-
oring Patricia Ann Pinney.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
ACCOM-

OF 
KATHY 
GOLDSCHMIDT 
AND 
NICOLE 
FOLK COOPER 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I’d like to 
take a moment to commemorate the public 
service of two individuals who have dedicated 
decades of their lives to enhancing the per-
formance of congressional offices, helping 
Members of Congress and congressional staff 
improve as professionals and public servants, 
and working to revitalize Congress as an insti-
tution. Kathy Goldschmidt is the Director of 
Strategic Initiatives at the Congressional Man-
agement Foundation and reached her 25th 
year of service there last month. Nicole Folk 
Cooper is the Director of Research and Publi-
cations at CMF, and last year reached her 
20th year of service. Both individually and as 
a team, Ms. Goldschmidt and Ms. Folk Cooper 
have made unparalleled contributions to en-
hancing the House and Senate. 
Starting at CMF in 1997, Ms. Goldschmidt 
recognized early on the potential impact of the 
internet on Congress and democracy, urging 
the organization to proactively work to help 
congressional offices with this new technology. 
During the last quarter of a century, she has 
authored or co-authored nearly every major 
CMF study on technology and Congress. In 
2006 she led the effort to help the House of 
Representatives create a 10-year information 
technology road map, a crucial step that 
helped institutional leaders identify areas for 
operational improvement. Recently, she co-au-
thored a series of reports, The Future of Cit-
izen Engagement, which has the potential to 
help every congressional office build greater 
trust in the Congress and democracy. And in 
2018 she co-authored a report entitled the Job 
Description for a Member of Congress that 
sought to provide a common understanding of 
the duties and responsibilities of a Member of 
Congress for all Americans. She has twice 
testified before congressional committees, in-
cluding the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress, which I chair. We 
thank her for her advice to our Committee and 
staff. 
Nicole Folk Cooper began working at CMF 
in 2001. For more than two decades she has 
trained staff, conducted analyses of congres-
sional offices, and overseen a broad range of 
CMF projects. For 16 years she has been the 
editor of CMF’s signature publication, Setting 
Course: A Congressional Management Guide. 
Every Member of Congress and senior staff is 
familiar with this unique publication, which pro-
vides thoughtful guidance on setting up and 
running a congressional office. She was the 
project manager and editor of a similar CMF 
publication, Keeping It Local: A Guide for 
Managing District & State Offices. Probably 
Ms. Folk Cooper’s greatest contribution to 
Congress has been her leadership in the last 
10 years of CMF’s ‘‘Life in Congress’’ project. 
This initiative, in partnership with the Society 
for Human Resource Management, seeks to 
identify human resource challenges in Con-
gress and provide recommendations for over-
coming them in order to help make Congress 
a better place for both Members and staffers 
to work. Especially as the dual stresses of the 
pandemic and the attacks of January 6th 
weighed so heavily on the congressional work-
force, CMF’s ‘‘Life in Congress’’ webinars and 
publications offered valuable guidance to 
Members and managers. 
As a team, Ms. Goldschmidt and Ms. Folk 
Cooper were also leaders in CMF’s ‘‘Gold 
Mouse Awards’’ project, which identifies best 
practices in congressional websites. The mod-
ern congressional website, which focuses on 
Members’ policy positions, voting records, and 
constituent services, was largely inspired and 
created by CMF and these two dedicated pub-
lic servants. 
Madam Speaker, we all know that Congress 
wouldn’t function without the invaluable work 
done every day by the staff who support us. 
Kathy Goldschmidt and Nicole Folk Cooper 
have been vital advisors and guides to Mem-
bers and staff for decades and have worked 
diligently to enhance the performance of con-
gressional offices and Congress as an institu-
tion. It’s hard to quantify every contribution or 
influence they’ve had on the Congress. But it’s 
easy to conclude that Congress, congressional 
staff, and democracy are better because of 
their work. I congratulate them both on these 
milestones in their long history of public serv-
ice and I look forward to continuing to work 
with them and their colleagues at CMF for 
years to come.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
OCTAVIA GREEN ROBINSON 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Octavia Green 
Robinson. 
Octavia Green Robinson was born March 
19, 1947, in New Orleans, Louisiana to Myrtle 
August Green and Oliver Daniel Green, Sr. Af-
fectionately known to all as ‘‘Tay’’ and ‘‘Big 
Momma’’ Robinson, she left this life on Feb-
ruary 6, 2022, at the age of 74. She was sur-
rounded by her family, just like she would 
have wanted. 
Octavia grew up in New Orleans’ Historic 
7th Ward. She is a graduate of Joseph S. 
Clark Senior High School, Dillard University, 
and Tulane University School of Social Work 
where she received her master’s degree. 
She was a decorated Sergeant with the 
New Orleans Police Department where in her 
early years she was part of the all-women’s 
team who created Community Relations which 
became a source of refuge and hope for the 
people of New Orleans. Octavia moved 
through the ranks of departments such as Ju-
venile Division, and others and retired fol-
lowing 45 years of service. 
Octavia was a proud member of Beautiful 
Zion Baptist Church, the First District Baptist 
Association, and Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. 
Octavia leaves her legacy of love for all in the 
hands of her beloved husband of 47 years Ed-
ward J. Robinson, Sr., and her children she so

Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Naiarah 
Velasquez for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Naiarah Velasquez is a student at Arvada 
West High School and received this award be-
cause her determination and hard work have

The dedication demonstrated by Naiarah 
Velasquez is exemplary of the type of

dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Naiarah Velasquez for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth

RECOGNIZING COLLEGE 
SETTLEMENT SUMMER CAMP 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a remarkable non-profit or-
ganization in my district, the College Settle-
ment Summer Camp. Founded in Horsham, 
Pennsylvania, College Settlement works to 
shape the lives of underserved young people 
and instill in them a respect for self, others, 
and the natural world. Their mission to deliver 
a unique, growth-focused camp experience 
has improved the lives of countless boys and 
girls. In neighborhoods and communities that 
are often divided, College Settlement offers an 
invaluable sense of belonging. The camp’s 
commitment to public service, inclusion, and 
affordable programming is admirable, and this 
year, as they celebrate 100 years of con-
necting our children to the outdoors, we ex-
press our appreciation for the impact that Col-
lege Settlement Summer Camp has had on 
Bucks and Montgomery counties and the 
greater Philadelphia area. 
ENCOURAGING SECURE SUPPLY 
CHAINS FOR CRITICAL MINERALS 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of myself and Congressman RUSS 
FULCHER to express grave concern with the 
vulnerability of supply chains and the long- 
term implications if we do not act now to de-
velop a secure supply chain of critical min-
erals. In light of the aggression shown by our 
adversaries, supply chain security is more im-
portant than ever. 
Our Nation is at a crossroads—Russia has 
invaded Ukraine. At the same time, China 
continues to use economic coercion to control 
global markets and shape countries’ political 
decisions. With Congress’ support, this Admin-
istration must take drastic and targeted meas-
ures to ensure our nation takes the right path 
to advance U.S. competitiveness and maintain 
a strong position in domestic and foreign mar-
kets, including critical minerals production. 
Critical minerals are vital to the emerging 
technologies that will underpin the future eco-
nomic well-being and prosperity of this Nation. 
In recognition of these important minerals, 
under President Trump, the Department of In-
terior developed a list of 35 critical minerals, a 
process that Congress later codified. That list, 
just last week, expanded to 50. Our home 
state of Idaho is rich in many of these min-
erals—some of which are fundamental to en-
ergy and national security applications—such 
as antimony and cobalt. 
Antimony and cobalt serve as critical com-
ponents in grid storage batteries, and other 
electrification implements essential to pro-
viding reliable energy sources to American 
homes and businesses. In addition to its en-
ergy contribution, antimony serves as a critical 
component of ammunition, armaments, and 
other national security platforms. Although 
these minerals serve as essential components 
in highly utilized U.S. products, 53 percent of 
antimony comes from China, and another 23 
percent comes from Russia. Most cobalt is 
sourced from the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC), where the Chinese government 
has subsidized companies that engage in non- 
transparent practices, dominate the industry, 
and undermine the prosperity and rights of the 
Congolese. 
Aside from mineral production, Idaho is re-
sponsible for cutting-edge mineral research. 
We are proud to be the home of the Idaho Na-
tional Lab, the nation’s premier nuclear energy 
laboratory, whose research is paramount to 
any future clean energy strategy. Unfortu-
nately, the Biden Administration chose to re-
move uranium from the critical minerals list, 
which leaves the nation’s nuclear fleet even 
more reliant on Russian fuel. 
As tensions rise with Russia and the poten-
tial of additional sanctions loom, China will 
look to take advantage of the void left by Rus-
sia’s isolation in the market. While we need to 
take strong actions on Russia, the reality is 
that we source many of our raw minerals from 
them. As we tighten our grip on their financial 
system and exports, we must prioritize domes-
tic sourcing and reduce our reliance on coun-
tries like Russia and China. 
The time is now for this Administration to 
take real action to prioritize a strong domestic 
supply chain for these essential minerals. We 
do not want to compromise any of our envi-
ronmental or other standards. We are simply 
calling on the Administration to prioritize the 
timely completion of the permits of currently 
proposed projects so we may take back con-
trol of a fundamental piece of many of our es-
sential industries: critical minerals production.

HONORING THE CAREER OF DEB 
SCHULTZ 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Deb Schultz of Noble County, who is re-
tiring this week from the Noble County clerk’s 
office after 22 years of service. 
Deb has served Noble County with excel-
lence. As Deputy Clerk, Deb’s primary respon-
sibility was helping oversee elections. Proc-
essing new voter registration, communicating 
with state election officials, monitoring poll 
workers, and more, she’s been the resident 
expert to which many have looked up and re-
lied on in Noble County for the last two-plus 
decades. 
Deb deserves special praise for her efforts 
in Fall 2020, which she described as having 
been ‘‘very difficult.’’ Tasked with having to ap-
prove and process hundreds of mail-in ballots 
and navigating the upending of other standard 
operating procedures, Deb nonetheless suc-
cessfully oversaw the election’s administration 
which Noble County residents agree was safe 
and secure. 
During her tenure as Deputy Clerk, many 
county clerks came and went, all of whom re-
lied heavily on Deb’s expertise and ability. She 
leaves behind a legacy that will not soon be 
forgotten and which has left an indelible mark 
on the community. As she closes this chapter 
of her life and begins a new one, I wish Deb 
the best and thank her for her commitment to 
Noble County and to the continuity of Amer-
ican democracy.

HONORING UNITED STATES NAVY 
MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER 
FERDINAND 
‘‘FERDIE’’ 
GARCIA 
FOR THIRTY YEARS OF TREMEN-
DOUS SERVICE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor U.S. Navy Master Chief Ferdi-
nand ‘‘Ferdie’’ Garcia for his unwavering serv-
ice to our country and its leaders. 
Master Chief Ferdinand Garcia was born in 
the Philippines on November 29, 1961. In 
1990, Mr. Garcia immigrated to the United 
States and enlisted in the U.S. Navy just two 
years later. Ferdie graduated from recruit 
training and then attended Mess Management 
Specialist School, where he graduated in the 
top ten percent of his class and was promoted 
to Petty Officer, Third Class. After Basic Train-
ing School, Mr. Garcia worked in various food 
service positions on board the USS Saipan 
(LHA 2) stationed out of Norfolk, Virginia. In 
1996, Mr. Garcia began working as a Mess 
Management Specialist School Instructor at 
Lackland Airforce Base in San Antonio, Texas. 
In July 2000, Mr. Garcia was recruited into 
the Presidential Food Service and served as a 
Petty Officer, First Class in the White House. 
He served as an Oval Office Enlisted Aide 
under three U.S. Presidents, including Bill 
Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. 
Throughout his service at the White House, 
Mr. Garcia advanced to Chief, Senior Chief, 
and was finally meritoriously promoted to Mas-
ter Chief Petty Officer in 2008. For ten more 
years, he continued to serve as an Enlisted 
Aide to five different U.S. Navy Admirals. 
Master Chief Petty Officer Garcia’s thirty 
years of selfless service in the U.S. Navy are 
marked with many medals and decorations, in-
cluding the Meritorious Service Medal with 
Gold Star Device, numerous Navy Com-
mendation Medals, and many Achievement 
Medals from the Navy, Marine Corps, and the 
Air Force. 
As Mr. Garcia closes his decades of service 
in the U.S. Navy ending his time at Walter 
Reed National Medical Center, I want to en-
sure he knows his country is extremely grate-
ful for his service. On behalf of New York’s 
21st Congressional District, I am honored to 
congratulate an incredible public servant and 
my friend, Master Chief Petty Officer Ferdi-
nand Garcia, on his retirement and wish him 
the best in his future endeavor.

COMMEMORATING THE 31ST ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
OPERATION 
DESERT STORM 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, this past 
week we commemorated the 31st anniversary 
of Operation Desert Storm and paid tribute to 
the men and women who served in the final 
effort to liberate Kuwait from invading Iraqi 
troops. The service members who carried out 
Operation Desert Storm were instrumental in 
bringing the Gulf War to an end. Their cour-
age and sacrifice are a symbol of our nation’s 
values and commitment to our allies around 
the world. 
That’s why I introduced House Resolution 
172, to designate February 28th as ‘‘Desert 
Storm Veterans Day’’ and to advocate for fair 
compensation and the highest quality medical 
treatment for veterans suffering from ailments 
associated with their Desert Storm service— 
some of which stem from exposure to chem-
ical, biological, and environmental toxins. 
I want to thank my constituent, Michael 
Emerson, for his fervent support of this effort. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
the tremendous contributions of those who 
served in Operation Desert Storm.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA CODE RETURNING 
CITIZENS COORDINATION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the District of Columbia Code 
Returning Citizens Coordination Act. This bill 
would require the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(BOP) to provide information to the District of 
Columbia government on individuals convicted 
of D.C. Code felonies under BOP jurisdiction 
to help ensure the District has services ready 
when such individuals return home. 
Individuals convicted of D.C. Code felonies 
face significant hurdles in preparing to return 
to society because most are in BOP facilities 
hundreds or even thousands of miles from the 
District, their families and their loved ones. Be-
cause they are frequently housed so far away 
from the District, coordinating returning citi-
zens’ reentry into society is difficult. 
Under this bill, the District government 
would know the health and other needs of in-
dividuals convicted of D.C. Code felonies be-
fore they are released from BOP custody. Indi-
viduals convicted of D.C. Code felonies are 
the only individuals required to be housed by 
BOP for violations of non-federal laws. 
Currently, under federal privacy laws, BOP 
is allowed to share information on individuals 
convicted of D.C. Code felonies with the Court 
Services and Offender Supervision Agency for 
the District of Columbia (CSOSA), since 
CSOSA is also a federal agency, but not with 
the D.C. government. This bill would require 
BOP to treat the D.C. government as they do 
other federal agencies for the purposes of— 
but only for the purposes of—federal privacy 
laws, such as the Privacy Act, so that the Dis-
trict government can obtain the necessary in-
formation to provide appropriate services to 
returning citizens. 
Specifically, the bill would require BOP, on 
an annual basis, to provide the District govern-
ment the following information on individuals 
convicted of D.C. Code felonies under BOP ju-
risdiction: the name, date of birth and Federal 
Register number, the facility where housed 
and the scheduled release date. In addition, 
upon the request of the D.C. government, 
BOP would have to provide the D.C. govern-
ment with the same information it provides 
CSOSA on such individuals. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

A ROSIE THE RIVETER DURING 
WORLD WAR II 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mrs. McCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Frances Mauro Masters for 
her service to this country as a Rosie the Riv-
eter, and to celebrate her 100th birthday. 
The daughter of Italian immigrants, Frances 
was born on March 7, 1922. Determined to 
serve her country, provide for her family and 
support her two brothers in the service, 
Frances rode the bus with her two sisters to 
and from the east side of Detroit to Ypsilanti, 
Michigan every day where she worked as a 
Riveter at the town’s Bomber Plant. A shy, 
quiet 
and 
hard-working 
young 
woman, 
Frances continued her work as a Riveter 
throughout the duration of World War II. The 
war sadly had enormous personal cost to 
Frances, as her brother lost his life. 
Madam Speaker, Frances Mauro Masters is 
a true American hero, the embodiment of the 
‘greatest generation’ and a role model for all 
Americans today, especially young women. As 
the years go by, it becomes even more impor-
tant to recognize humble and outstanding 
members of our greatest generation like 
Frances. I thank Frances for her service to 
this country and the selfless example she has 
set for all of us, and congratulate her on 100 
years of life well-lived.

HONORING THE LIFE & ACHIEVE-
MENTS OF REV. H.D. DARBY 
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the selfless leadership and ad-
vocacy of Waukegan resident Reverend Hen-
derson ‘‘H.D.’’ Darby, who was instrumental in 
securing the right to vote for Black people in 
the Jim Crow South. 
Rev. Darby first tried to cast his vote in Jef-
ferson Davis County, Mississippi in the early 
1950s. As NAACP records show, before he 
could register he was required to pass an oral 
examination where he was asked obscure 
questions about the Mississippi and Federal 
constitutions. Although Rev. Darby answered 
these unfair questions to the best of his ability, 
but was simply told, ‘‘You did not qualify.’’ 
Rev. Darby did not give up. Instead, he 
sued the county circuit clerk, James Daniel, 
for access to the ballot box in the 1958 case, 
Darby v. Daniel. His case was among the first 
federal court attempts to secure voting rights 
for Black voters. During the suit he was called 
‘‘extremely radical. if not dangerous’’ and ‘‘bit-
ter for trying to exercise his constitutional right. 
With help from lawyers from the NAACP’s 
Legal Defense Fund—including future Su-
preme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall—Rev. 
Darby prevailed with his case. 
Rev. Darby’s landmark win granted all Afri-
can Americans the right to vote without ob-
struction, such as having to take an oral ex-
amination. His lawsuit is estimated to have 
helped secure voting rights for approximately 
1,300 African American voters in Jefferson 
Davis County, according to Jet Magazine. 
Thanks to the fearlessness of civil rights lead-
ers like Rev. Darby, millions of African Ameri-
cans have the right to vote today. 
At a time when voting rights are once again 
under attack across the country, we are all 
served well by learning the stories and hon-
oring the sacrifices of civil rights figures like 
Rev. Darby. The legacy of these great Amer-
ican heroes, such as Rep. John Lewis, Fannie 
Lou Hamer, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and so 
many others must be protected with unwaver-
ing commitment to protecting the right to vote. 
Rev. Darby’s pioneering activism made him 
a leader before his time. I am honored that he 
came to call Waukegan, Illinois his adopted 
home later in life. He lived in our community 
until he passed away in 1993. 
Today, his legacy lives on through his loved 
ones, including his grandson, Christopher 
‘‘Brotha’’ Blanks, who is known in Waukegan 
for his moving poetry, social activism and ad-
vocacy, and the work he does through his 
nonprofit, Black Abolition Movement for the 
Mind. 
It is my privilege to recognize Rev. Hender-
son 
‘‘H.D.’’ 
Darby 
for 
his 
fearlessness, 
strength and patriotism. I know that his legacy 
will continue to live on through his family, 
friends and all those who learn and are in-
spired by his shining example. 
RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF MR. 
BRUCE THOMPSON 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bruce Thompson for his 
achievement on being selected as the 2021 
Virginia Business Person of the Year. One of 
Hampton Roads’ most prominent developers 
and hoteliers, this accomplishment comes 
after nearly four decades of investing in Vir-
ginia Beach and Hampton Roads. 
A long-time businessman in Virginia Beach, 
Bruce opened his first hotel, Ocean House 
Hotel, around 1982. His overwhelming suc-
cess led to the founding of Professional Hospi-
tality Resources, Gold Key, a timeshare com-
pany, and significant achievements in the res-
taurant business. Bruce played a major role in 
establishing high-end hotel and amenities at 
the Oceanfront and was crucial in the revital-
ization of the once condemned Cavalier Hotel, 
turning it into the centerpiece of the Cavalier 
Resort. 
Bruce’s dedication and commitment have 
not been limited solely to the business sphere. 
He is also very active in politics and philan-
thropy. Over the years, Bruce has sat on nu-
merous boards and commissions, namely, 
serving as Hampton Roads’ regional finance 
chair. After his son Josh lost his battle with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), his family 
founded a nonprofit that has raised more than 
$20 million for stem cell research and other 
ALS-related causes. 
Madam Speaker, I am thankful for Bruce’s 
hard work and service to the entire Virginia 
Beach community. It is my honor to recognize 
Mr. Bruce Thompson today and I have full 
confidence that he will continue to be an inte-
gral contributor to the Virginia Beach and 
Hampton Road community.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the City of Golden’s Chief 
of Police Bill Kilpatrick for his incredible, 42 
year-long career in law enforcement and to 
congratulate him on his upcoming retirement. 
Chief Kilpatrick began his career with 10 
years on the police force in Englewood, Colo-
rado, during which he was promoted to the 
rank of Sergeant and earned his Juris Doctor 
from the University of Denver. His commitment 
to public safety led him to the Golden Police 
Department in 1989, where he became chief 
in 2002. 
During his tenure, he guided the force 
through an unprecedented period of growth 
and achievement, raising the bar for what it 
means to be a public servant. Among his 
many accomplishments, he established Crisis 
Intervention Training programs in Jefferson 
County, helped found Colorado Crisis Serv-
ices—the largest emergency mental health 
service hotline in the state, and was honored 
with the Colorado Association of Police Chiefs 
President’s Award in 2011 in recognition of his 
tireless dedication to his community. 
Chief Kilpatrick will be dearly missed on the 
force, and I wish him the best in his retire-
ment. I thank him for his service and commit-
ment to our community and our state.

was just 17 years old. She found a new home 
in Bakersfield, California, and graduated from 
West High School in 1979. 
Mrs. Camp spent most of her adult life giv-
ing back to others. Her philanthropic work in 
the Central Valley supported countless groups 
of people. Throughout her life she was able to 
raise millions of dollars for charity. Together 
with her husband, Jim, the Camps selflessly 
served their community and helped lift people 
out of the most challenging of circumstances. 
Mrs. Camp’s charitable work was recog-
nized by many different groups throughout her 
philanthropic career. She was awarded the 
Community Service Person of the Year Award 
from the Kern County Hispanic Chamber of 
Commerce, the Humanitarian of the Year 
Award by the Community Action Partnership, 
and the Woman of the Year Award for Califor-
nia’s 16th Senate District after being person-
ally nominated by Senator Shannon Grover. 
Additionally, many Catholic charities recog-
nized the work of Mrs. Camp, a dedicated 
Catholic herself, through their naming of the 
Beverly Camp Career and Education Center. 
Mrs. Camp was a valued member of our 
local community, and it is with great pride that 
I recognize her for her life of service in the 
Central Valley community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in 
the House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring the life of Mrs. Beverly Camp.

IN HONOR OF 40 YEARS OF 
ZINGERMAN’S 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Zingerman’s Delicatessen 
in Ann Arbor, Michigan as they celebrate four 
decades in business. Their significant con-
tributions to our community and their 40 years 
spent as an Ann Arbor institution are worthy of 
commendation. 
Zingerman’s started off as an idea, sparked 
by a conversation between Ari Weinzweig and 
Paul Saginaw noting that Ann Arbor was lack-
ing the traditional Jewish deli that they had 
back home in Chicago and Detroit, and just a 
few short years after that idea became reality. 
On March 15, 1982, they opened their doors

in a former grocery store on the corner of 
Kingsley and Detroit Streets in Kerrytown. In 
the coming years they expanded their deli, 
adding dry goods, cheeses, pastries, breads, 
and desserts. What started as a conversation 
between friends has grown into a world-fa-
mous business providing legendary sand-
wiches and other delicacies to hungry cus-
tomers. 
Since first opening in 1982, Zingerman’s 
has expanded. growing into a family of busi-
nesses, but they’ve kept their promise to re-
main close to home in Washtenaw County, 
where they employ over 700 full-time and part- 
time staff. From the hand-crafted cheeses of 
Zingerman’s Creamery to the sweet treats of 
Zingerman’s Candy Manufactory, they have 
something for everyone. In addition to their 
food offerings and event spaces, Zingerman’s 
ZingTrain shares their unique business model 
with clients from all sections of industry, train-
ing them in topics like leadership and cus-
tomer service. The stellar team is what makes 
Zingerman’s so special. No matter their posi-
tion, every employee has a say in how the 
business makes decisions due to their open- 
book management system, cultivating a family 
environment and making it a great place to 
work. 
In addition to their successful businesses, 
Zingerman’s has done their part to better our 
community. In 1988 they founded Food Gath-
erers, a food rescue program that feeds the 
hungry in Washtenaw County. They started off 
collecting produce and other goods from gro-
cery stores and restaurants and redistributed it 
to hot meal programs in Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti. Now Food Gatherers has grown to oper-
ate food pantries, provide support services for 
those looking to take advantage of food bene-
fits, 
and 
running 
food 
distributions. 
Zingerman’s has never forgotten to give back 
to the place they call home. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Zingerman’s Delicatessen, 
Paul Saginaw, Ari Weinzweig, and the entire 
Zingerman’s team on this special day. We are 
grateful for their four decades spent nourishing 
and enriching our community in Ann Arbor. 
We wish them the very best in the years to 
come.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
and 
applaud 
Chris 
Coalman-Angelo (Angelo) for receiving the Ar-
vada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for

mination and hard work have allowed him to 
overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Angelo is 
exemplary of the type of achievement that can 
be attained with hard work and perseverance. 
It is essential students at all levels strive to 
make the most of their education and develop 
a work ethic which will guide them for the rest 
of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to An-
gelo for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassador for Youth award. I have 
no doubt he will exhibit the same dedication 
and character in all of his future accomplish-

‘‘SIX 
TRIPLE 
EIGHT’’ 
CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT OF 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 28, 2022 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the legacy of the 6888th Central Postal 
Directory Battalion, known as the ‘‘Six Triple 
Eight.’’ I also rise to support S. 321, the legis-
lation to award a Congressional Gold Medal in 
honor of the Battalion’s patriotism, valor, and 
achievements. 
Since its first mission in 1945, the Six Triple 
Eight was comprised of 855 Black women in-
cluding 824 enlisted personnel and 31 officers. 
Groundbreaking for the time, the Six Triple 
Eight was the only African American women’s 
unit of its size to serve overseas during World 
War II. Most of the 6888th worked as postal 
clerks, but others were cooks, mechanics, and 
held support positions so that the 6888th was 
a self-sufficient unit. 
The Six Triple Eight was led by Major Char-
ity Edna Adams and trained for their overseas 
mission at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia. In prac-
tice, the Battalion’s assignment entailed more 
than ensuring the swift delivery of mail. Rath-
er, the Battalion was also trained to identify 
enemies by air and sea, meet the physical de-
mands of military service, and evacuate tar-
geted ships. 
Amid war, the tenacity of these brave 
women never wavered. Rain or shine, day in 
and day out, the Six Triple Eight worked 
around the clock, operating under their motto, 
‘‘no mail, low morale.’’ These women sac-
rificed despite knowing their return home 
would be to an America that still denied their 
basic rights and liberties. 
I am proud to support this measure that 
honors such a courageously driven Battalion 
of women and bestows them the highest ex-
pression of national appreciation Congress 
can grant. 
I urge swift passage of S. 321, the ‘‘Six Tri-
ple Eight’’ Congressional Gold Medal Act of 
2021.

FOOTBALL STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 7, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Harding Academy in Searcy and 
Robinson High School in Little Rock as Arkan-
sas State Football Champions. 
Harding Academy defeated Prescott with a 
score of 47 to 25 to come the 3A Football 
State Champions, marking the third year in a 
row they have won the state championship 
with a grand total of 9 championships. 
Robinson High School defeated the reigning 
State Champions, Shiloh Christian, 41 to 14 to 
become the 4A Football State Champions. 
This marked Robinson High School’s fourth 
state championship victory. 
I am proud of the hard work and dedication 
from the players, coaches, and administrators 
who made these accomplishments possible. 
Keep making central Arkansas proud.
