The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, open our eyes to Your 
movements in our midst. Remind our 
lawmakers that You have brought us 
through times more challenging than 
what we now face. Keep them from 
being intimidated by this global pan-
demic, as they cling to Your promises

phant providence. 
Lord, continue to protect them and

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I bet 
all of our fellow Senators have been 
hearing 
from 
businesses, 
hospitals, 
nursing homes, and local civic business 
and political leaders about the issues 
they are facing right now due to the 
coronavirus health crisis. 
Likewise, I have been talking to fam-
ily and friends back home in Iowa. I 
find that they are banding together to 
support one another. In times of strife, 
Iowans can count on each other. 
We have to give special attention to 
the hard work of our medical profes-
sionals and first responders. They are 
under immense pressure and going 
above and beyond to serve their com-
munities. I believe they are doing 
God’s work, keeping the American peo-
ple safe and healthy. So I thank our 
medical professionals and first re-
sponders for their dedication to their 
communities and send my encourage-
ment to keep up their essential work in 
the days and weeks ahead, as we see 
ourselves through this virus pandemic 
we are in. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Senators have now spent days engaged 
in 
vigorous 
bipartisan 
discussions 
among ourselves and with the adminis-
tration. 
Earlier today, I hosted a productive 
meeting in my office with the Demo-
cratic leader, the Speaker of the House, 
the House Republican leader, and the 
Secretary of the Treasury. These in-
tense conversations have built a piece 
of legislation that is as bold and as big 
as the American people deserve and as 
thoroughly bipartisan as our process 
demands. 
Now what we need to do is to move 
forward. This national crisis is not 
going to wait around if Congress slips 
back into conventional politics or hag-
gles endlessly over the finer points. 
Every day, more Americans’ jobs are 
disappearing or coming ever closer to 
the brink. Every day, more small busi-
nesses are faced with hard decisions 
that could change local communities, 
literally, forever. Every day, major 
American 
companies 
that 
employ 
countless people are seeing their com-
merce crushed by their own govern-
ment for the sake of public health. 
Every 
day, 
doctors, 
nurses, 
and 
healthcare professionals will keep re-
porting to work and treating patients, 
whether or not Congress has their 
back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1894 
March 22, 2020 
The risks to our country grow every 
single day that we do not act. The 
needs of hospitals and healthcare pro-
viders grow every day that we do not 
act. 
That is why we have worked around 
the clock to craft a major bipartisan 
relief package. That is why we are 
going to hold our first procedural vote 
in just a few minutes. It is so that we 
can keep moving forward, because this 
virus is not going to wait for politics as 
usual. 
These past few days have brought 
unity and bipartisan energy here to the 
Senate. I think Members on both sides 
agree that it has been very encour-
aging. 
Since Senate Republicans released 
our initial framework to give some 
structure to these discussions, both 
sides have worked hard to create some-
thing that can pass the Senate, pass 
the House, and be signed into law by 
the President. 
The 
bipartisan 
product 
delivers 
strongly on each of the core priorities 
we identified at the outset. It puts ur-
gently needed cash in the hands of 
American workers and families. It de-
livers historic and rapid relief to small 
businesses so they can make payroll 
and keep people employed. It helps sta-
bilize key industries to avoid layoffs 
wherever possible and preserve the 
greatest economy in the world for 
when we come out on the other side of 
this. And, of course, it sends a mas-
sive—massive—new 
infusion 
of 
re-
sources to the frontlines of the medical 
response. 
That is what we have to do: inject a 
significant amount of money as quick-
ly as possible into households, small 
businesses, key sectors, and our Na-
tion’s hospitals and health centers. 
This bill would do that, and it would 
do it fast. The comprise product also 
contains many ideas that our Demo-
cratic colleagues brought to the table. 
It balances the administration’s focus 
on sending direct cash to Americans as 
quickly as possible with our Demo-
cratic colleagues’ focus on bolstering 
State unemployment insurance pro-
grams. It places conditions which our 
Democratic colleagues have sought on 
the loans that would flow to major 
businesses, conditions which the Presi-
dent has also endorsed. And both par-
ties have made sure to keep strength-
ening the resources that will be pushed 
out to the frontlines. 
The bill includes $75 billion in a new 
fund for hospitals and health providers, 
and more than three-quarters of the 
funds in the appropriations section— 
nearly $200 billion—will not stay in 
Washington but will go straight to 
State and local priorities. 
So what we have is a comprise prod-
uct which contains ideas, contribu-
tions, and priorities from both sides 
and which can become law as soon as 
tomorrow—as soon as tomorrow. In 
other words, it is just about time to 
take yes for an answer. 
We are now at a point which every 
American who has ever negotiated any-
thing would recognize, whether they 
have purchased a home, bought a car, 
or negotiated for their small business. 
We are at the point where both sides 
have come a long way toward each 
other, and each side has to decide 
whether to continue elbowing and ar-
guing over the last several inches and 
risk the whole thing or whether to 
shake hands and get it done. 
Thus far, throughout this crisis, the 
Senate has risen to the occasion. It was 
just a few days ago when the Senate 
Republican majority moved expedi-
tiously to pass the House Democrats’ 
phase 2 legislation, even though many 
of my colleagues on this side of the 
aisle and I had serious reservations and 
would have written it very differently. 
We passed it anyway. It was basically 
written on the House side. Neverthe-
less, as I just said, I pushed the Speak-
er’s legislation through the Senate be-
cause urgency and results matter dur-
ing a national crisis; because, imper-
fections notwithstanding, it was the 
right thing to do for our country. 
So, look—look—I hope and anticipate 
that a similar degree of bipartisanship 
and urgency will be reciprocated now. I 
understand the Speaker said following 
our meeting this morning that she may 
simply give up on these bipartisan 
talks and begin writing her own sepa-
rate bill. Perhaps that is related to the 
remarks of one of her senior House 
Democratic leaders who reportedly told 
colleagues a few days ago: ‘‘This is a 
tremendous opportunity to restructure 
things to fit our vision.’’ 
‘‘ . . . a tremendous opportunity to 
restructure things to fit our vision.’’ 
Well, I sincerely hope that nobody 
actually views this crisis in such a cyn-
ical manner. This is not a political op-
portunity. It is a national emergency. 
That is why we have engaged in days of 
bipartisan talks to get to this point. It 
is why it is time to move forward. 
Americans don’t need to see us hag-
gling endlessly. They don’t need us to 
jeopardize all the progress we have 
made over the past several days for the 
sake of some eleventh-hour brinkman-
ship. The American people need an out-
come, and they need it tomorrow. They 
need us to vote to advance this legisla-
tion today and pass it tomorrow. 
As I said yesterday, Congress should 
take inspiration from our own con-
stituents. We should be inspired by our 
own constituents. Look at what they 
are doing. Even during this pandemic, 
the American people are showing the 
world the soul of our country. 
In my home State of Kentucky, the 
official motto is ‘‘United we stand, di-
vided we fall.’’ And every day I hear 
about 
new 
ways 
Kentuckians 
are 
standing united, even if they have to 
stand 6 feet apart. 
I recently heard about a resident of 
Campbell County in Northern Ken-
tucky named Debbie Buckley. In her 
day job, Debbie works for the local gov-
ernment, but recently she heard about 
some students at a nearby university 
who were still living in the dorms even 
though in-person classes have been 
canceled. Some had to remain in the 
area for work. Others were inter-
national students who couldn’t get 
home. Their situations were com-
pletely uncertain. 
The local shelves were not fully 
stocked, so Debbie decided to do some-
thing. She put out a call for help, and 
Kentuckians 
answered 
the 
call. 
Churches, restaurants, and neighbors 
all pitched in with food and supplies. 
Debbie drove all over Northern Ken-
tucky collecting those donations and 
then delivering them to these young 
people. 
She has found everything a college 
student could need: canned goods, 
microwaveable 
meals, 
and 
even 
Airheads candy, which I am proud to 
say are made right there in Kentucky. 
There are so many stories like this 
pouring in from all over our country. 
Americans are stepping up to the plate. 
Americans realize this is no time for 
selfishness and no time for division but 
a time for solidarity, generosity, and, 
yes, courage. 
Americans are rising to the occasion. 
The Senate must do the same. Let’s 
move this legislation forward this 
afternoon, as the last few discussions 
begin to wind down, and then let’s get 
this done tomorrow. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
begin, we just learned that our col-
league Senator RAND PAUL has tested 
positive 
for 
the 
coronavirus. 
Our 
thoughts and prayers are with him for 
a speedy recovery. We will consult with 
the attending physician at the Capitol 
about appropriate measures for those 
of us who have been in contact with 
the Senator. 
This is the kind of situation that 
Americans across the country are deal-
ing with right now, and it underscores 
the importance of acting immediately 
to deliver more relief for the American 
people. 
The Senate has been working around 
the clock over the past few days to put 
together a third round of coronavirus 
legislation. We are very close to mov-
ing forward with a major bill that will 
deliver much needed relief to American 
families, workers, and businesses and 
put more resources into the hands of 
medical professionals. 
This is a big bill, but this situation 
requires a big and bold response. 
Across our country, American workers 
and American businesses are strug-
gling. Families are scared. Businesses 
have been forced to drastically curtail

or close their operations, and social 
distancing has become a public health 
priority. 
Workers are wondering how long 
they will be getting a paycheck. Small 
businesses are worrying about whether 
they will be able to reopen their doors 
when all of this is over. Key industries 
have taken a massive economic hit. A 
major response is required. 
The package we put together address-
es a number of priorities: putting emer-
gency cash into the hands of American 
families and American workers quick-
ly, in a way that ensures those most in 
need get the maximum level of sup-
port; delivering relief to small busi-
nesses to help them keep their workers 
employed; injecting stability into the 
economy to help bridge this crisis and 
to limit layoffs; providing new re-
sources for State unemployment pro-
grams to help workers displaced by 
this 
emergency; 
and 
most 
impor-
tantly—most importantly—continuing 
to deliver resources to the healthcare 
workers fighting to stop this pandemic. 
This package is the product of bipar-
tisan input, and I hope it will receive 
overwhelming bipartisan support in the 
Senate. Republicans and Democrats 
have already come together to deliver 
two coronavirus relief bills. It is time 
for us to come together again to de-
liver this legislation. 
As the leader said yesterday, the 
American people need help, and they 
need it now. This bill will provide them 
with relief. 
These are challenging times. There is 
a lot of stress and uncertainty, and 
Americans are understandably worried. 
We are going to get through this. There 
may be difficult days ahead, but we are 
going to come out the other side. 
All around this country, Americans 
are standing up to meet this challenge. 
We have our heroic healthcare workers 
who are putting their lives on the line 
to care for the seriously ill, our first 
responders who got their name because 
they are always the first on the scene 
in any crisis, and new heroes: grocery 
store employees, truck drivers, deliv-
ery people, pharmacy employees—peo-
ple we may have taken for granted be-
fore but won’t again. 
Everywhere I look in my State, I see 
South Dakotans helping other South 
Dakotans. It is the same all across this 
country: people looking out for their 
neighbors, providing meals for those in 
need, offering childcare help to those 
who can’t telework, running errands 
for elderly, or those with compromised 
immune systems who can’t leave their 
house. 
I was touched to read a story from 
the 
Rapid 
City 
Journal 
yesterday 
about a group of young people from 
Eagle Butte, SD, who showed up out-
side the Medicine Wheel Village Nurs-
ing Home to hold up signs to encourage 
the residents who can’t receive visitors 
right now because of the risk of virus 
transmission. 
We are going to get through this to-
gether. My colleagues and I in the Sen-
ate are going to keep working to de-
liver the resources that Americans 
need to confront and defeat this dis-
ease. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to 
proceed to H.R. 748, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following: 
A bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on 
high cost employer-sponsored health cov-
erage. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in 
a few minutes, the majority leader will 
begin a process that will permit the 
Senate to act for the third time to deal 
with this unprecedented healthcare cri-
sis that we are facing. Our message to 
the American people is this: This is 
about your paycheck. This is a collec-
tion of the best ideas that Democratic 
Senators and Republican Senators have 
that we believe will generate trillions 
in economic support that will, No. 1, 
keep payroll checks coming; No. 2, re-
lieve the financial burdens on Ameri-
cans; and No. 3, begin to contain this 
COVID–19 virus. 
The legislation we will be voting on 
will contain about $1.7 trillion in Fed-
eral spending, and it will authorize the 
Federal Reserve Board and the Treas-
ury Department to generate trillions 
more in liquidity and credit support for 
companies of all kinds to try to keep 
payrolls checks coming to workers. 
In the end, the only way to end this 
crisis—and the only way to get the 
American economy moving again—is to 
contain the disease. This will require, 
as soon as possible, adopting a new 
goal. That goal should be to test every 
American who needs it for COVID–19 as 
soon as possible, and then isolate and 
care for the few who are sick and fast- 
track treatments and vaccines so that 
Americans can go back to work and go 
out to eat and resume a normal life 
again. This legislation will make all 
COVID–19 tests free. 
The government has shut down the 
economy to fight this disease, and the 
government has to help pay the cost of 
the suffering that this disease has 
caused, but the sooner we make more 
tests available and stop telling Ameri-
cans not to get a test, the better. 
Just yesterday, a California company 
announced a 45-minute test that could 
be taken in a doctor’s office while also 
getting a flu test. Expanding tests like 
this will do more to get the economy 
moving again than spending trillions 
stabilizing businesses and supporting 
employees. 
Yesterday, I spoke with the chief ex-
ecutive officer of the company that 
makes that test. This is a well-estab-
lished company that makes millions of 
flu tests. He said they could make 
45,000 tests available by the end of the 
month and 2 million tests by the end of 
June. More instances of expansion of 
tests that you can get at the same time 
you visit a doctor’s office is what we 
need. 
The legislation the Senate will be 
considering has three goals: one, keep 
the payroll checks coming as much as 
possible; two, relieve financial burdens 
on Americans; and, three, contain the 
disease. 
Keeping the payroll checks coming 
means $300 billion for loans to small 
businesses. If they use the loans to pay 
the wages, the loans will be forgiven. 
It authorizes the Federal Reserve 
Board and the Treasury Department to 
create trillions more in financial credit 
support for States, cities, and large 
businesses so they will be able to stay 
in business and pay their employees. 
It expands the emergency paid sick 
and family leave passed by the House 
and then the Senate last week—to 
workers who were laid off and later re-
hired by their employers. 
The second goal is to relieve the fi-
nancial burden on Americans. That 
section of the bill includes checks to 
individuals and families: $1,200 for indi-
viduals, $2,400 for a couple, and $500 for 
each eligible child. 
Federal income taxes don’t have to 
be filed until July 15. Estimated taxes 
can be delayed until October 15. It will 
make it easier to use retirement sav-
ings without penalty. 
All student loan payments will be de-
ferred for 6 months. There are 43 mil-
lion Americans with student loans. 
There is priority on both sides of the 
aisle for more Federal funding for 
State unemployment insurance pro-
grams, so States can increase benefits, 
waive the waiting week, and expand 
eligibility to self-employed and inde-
pendent contractors. 
There is money for block grants for 
States for K–12 education, for higher 
education, and for children and fami-
lies, including the child care and devel-
opment block grants, which will pro-
vide immediate assistance to childcare 
centers. 
Finally, containing the disease is the 
third goal. It makes all COVID–19 tests 
free. There is nearly $100 billion for the 
public health and social services emer-
gency fund. That is at least $75 billion 
for hospitals and $10.5 billion for accel-
erating diagnostics, treatments, and 
vaccines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1896 
March 22, 2020 
We are probably a few months away 
from a treatment for COVID–19. This 
would accelerate the efforts that are 
being made now to determine if these 
treatments work and if they are safe. 
We are even further away from a vac-
cine, but if there is any way to accel-
erate that vaccine, this $10 billion will 
help to do that. 
There is another $1.7 billion for the 
strategic national stockpile, which has 
the purpose of buying the equipment 
that our medical personnel especially 
need; $4.5 billion for the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention for 
State and local preparedness and re-
sponse grants and to improve public 
health; $80 million for the Food and 
Drug 
Administration, 
again, 
for 
diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines; 
$1.32 billion for community health cen-
ters. There are 1,400 centers with 12,000 
sites. They are the hospitals for prob-
ably 28 or 30 million Americans across 
this country. And there is $20 billion 
for veterans healthcare. 
The goal of the legislation we will be 
considering has these objectives: keep 
the paychecks coming as much as pos-
sible, relieve financial burdens on 
Americans, and, most importantly, 
contain the disease. 
Senator THUNE mentioned that now 
one of our Members, Senator PAUL of 
Kentucky, has tested positive for the 
coronavirus. That reminds us of what 
every family in this country is going 
through today and worrying about. It 
also should remind us of the urgency of 
moving ahead. 
We have been working together for 
several days with our counterparts on 
the other side. This is a collection of 
ideas that will keep the paychecks 
coming, relieve financial burdens, and 
contain the disease. It is time to vote 
on it, approve it by a big margin, and 
send it to the House of Representatives 
so we can intensify our efforts. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I

at 6 p.m.

objection, it is so ordered. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mr. 
MANCHIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
would like to just say a few words 
about what we are going through and 
what we are experiencing. I can only 
give you my experiences back home in 
West Virginia. 
I have been on conference calls be-
cause we are social distancing, as we 
all are. I have talked to the nurses’ as-
sociation, the medical association, and 
the hospital association. The main con-
cern we have right now is of our med-
ical providerships’ being stable enough 
and protected enough so, if need be, 
they can continue to take care of us. 
Right now, they are scared to death be-
cause they are not getting the protec-
tive equipment they need. They don’t 
have the personal protection equip-
ment, such as the masks or the shields 
or the gowns—all of the equipment 
that a first responder or a medical pro-
vider should have. That is what we are 
fighting for right now. Also, we have 
rural 
hospitals 
and 
rural 
clinics 
throughout all of America—West Vir-
ginia is mostly all rural—and they are 
all scared to death that they are not 
going to have the finances with which 
to stay afloat. 
The proposal that we have right now, 
that they are working on—that both 
sides are working on—is inadequate 
and insufficient. MITCH
MCCONNELL’s 
proposal falls short of delivering the 
protection the medical providerships 
need. They talk about the economy and 
the recovery of this economy, but we 
need to find a treatment for the virus 
as we know it. For the people who do 
contract it, they will know they have a 
treatment that can cure them, and 
then we must find a working vaccine as 
quickly as possible. We have been told 
that this could take 12 months or 
longer. 
The treatment is the most important 
thing, and protecting our healthcare 
workers is the most important thing. 
Keeping our hospitals and clinics and 
all medical providers vibrant right now 
and able to survive this economic 
downturn is the first and foremost 
thing, and it is the thing that didn’t 
get the attention that we needed. 
I am hoping that between now and 
before we vote, at 6 o’clock, the two 
sides can come together. I implore of 
my colleagues on the Republican side 
to basically express their concerns to 
their leader, MITCH MCCONNELL, that 
we need to have a balanced approach. 
I am concerned about the economy. I 
am 
concerned 
about 
the 
workers. 
Through no fault of their own, we have 
had workers throughout West Virginia 
who have been laid off. They have done 
nothing wrong except to have been in 
professions, basically, because of the 
health concerns of our country, that 
had to lay them off. The businesses 
they worked for had to stop—cease and 
desist. They had to stop. It was 
through no fault of their own. Basi-
cally, for the health of this country, it 
was best if they closed. These people 
have no control whatsoever over their 
destinies except to ask: When can we 
get this thing cured? When do we get 
ahead of this cycle, or ahead of the 
curve, so we may get back to normal? 
Wall Street will not return, I can as-
sure you, no matter how much money 
we throw at Wall Street. It is not going 
to have confidence built into it is as 
long as the virus is out there without 
any type of a treatment or a vaccine 
coming down the pike that is going to 
cure and protect us. That is what this 
is all about. 
Don’t you think we should be putting 
the resources on the front end to help 
these providers, to give some assur-
ances to the American public, to the 
people in West Virginia that we have 
found and we have a treatment now 
that will work? 
God forbid if you contract the dis-
ease, and the virus attacks you, but we 
can help you. You are not going to per-
ish from this. But with that being said, 
it doesn’t make any sense to me that— 
the proposal that Leader MCCONNELL 
from the Republican side has put forth 
is absolutely, totally worried about 
Wall Street at this time. 
I am worried about the people in 
rural West Virginia and all over Main 
Street. Those are the people we are 
worried about, and Wall Street is going 
to do just fine. It has always rebounded 
real well. They always come back 
strong. But the market has to have sta-
bility to it and it has to have con-
fidence in it and the people have to 
have confidence. 
So that is where we stand. Let’s take 
care of the people whom we are asking 
to take care of us if we need them. 
Let’s take care of our healthcare work-
ers, our nurses, our first responders, all 
of our doctors. Let’s take care of the 
facilities that they are keeping open 
for us, which is the hospitals and the 
clinics—everything that we possibly 
can to protect them. Let’s make sure 
that our workers and these healthcare 
providers don’t go down because if that 
system goes down, I can assure you, 
you can’t print enough money for Wall 
Street to rebound. If the healthcare 
system in this country is not able to 
take care of the people of America, 
that will not happen. 
And if West Virginians can’t count 
on our hospitals and clinics to take 
care of them, and if the workers who 
work there—the nurses and all of the 
different people who work within that 
system—aren’t able to go to work be-
cause they might have contracted the 
virus, we have done nothing special to 
help them with their childcare and ev-
erything because they will be working 
extraordinary hours. This is where our 
emphasis should be right today. This is 
what we should be talking about. 
Yet we are miles apart now because 
Wall Street is not maybe taken care of 
to the likes of what they would like. I 
can’t understand it at all. I really 
don’t. I want them to succeed, and they 
will succeed. I want them to have a 
generous loan program—not a gift but 
a loan program—and I want to make 
sure that people who have lost their 
jobs and the business has closed down 
due to no fault of their own have the 
backing of this great country of ours 
and the government right here. That is 
whom I am worried about. 
The proposal that is on the table 
today does not do that. If we had to

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019—Motion 
to Proceed—Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the 
United States is facing a crisis unlike 
any other in our recent history. This is 
no time for partisanship or for political 
differences to prevent us from coming 
together and working in the best inter-
ests of the American people. 
The coronavirus pandemic has ar-
rived on our shores, and it is growing 
exponentially, sickening our people 
and devastating our economy. As of 
today, more than 26,700 Americans 
have tested positive for the virus, and 
340 people have died, while 176 have re-
covered. In my home State of Maine, 
there are now 89 cases in 8 different 
counties. 
Hospitals, doctors, and nurses are 
struggling to triage the influx of pa-
tients. Nursing homes are locking 
down their facilities in an attempt to 
safeguard their vulnerable residents. 
Students and teachers have had to 
transition abruptly to online learning 
as schools have closed across the Na-
tion. Parents have been left with no 
childcare. Workers have been laid off 
or fear that they may soon lose their 
jobs as the outbreak worsens. 
To help mitigate the spread of this 
dangerous virus and protect those who 
are at highest risk, Americans have 
stepped forward to take the proper pre-
cautions and to follow the guidelines 
that are issued by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control. 
Although measures such as limiting 
large social gatherings and reducing 
nonessential travel are important to 
help contain the coronavirus and re-
duce contagion, they are also taking a 
tremendous toll on our economy. There 
are 30 million small businesses in the 
United States. They employ nearly 60 
million Americans, about half of our 
Nation’s workforce. According to a re-
cent survey, 96 percent of small busi-
ness owners say they have already been 
affected by the coronavirus—not in the 
sense that they have become ill with it, 
but their customer base has simply 
dried up—and 51 percent say they will 
only be able to keep open for up to 3 
months if the economic consequences 
continue. The potential loss of more 
than half of our Nation’s small busi-
nesses, and the impact on the millions 
of people they employ is simply unac-
ceptable. 
In my State the number of claims for 
unemployment filed in a span of just 3 
days this month was nearly double 
those filed in all of March 1 year ago. 
Maine is on track to surpass the high-
est weekly total of unemployment 
claims since the great recession of 2008. 
The situation is dire, and it is only 
going to get worse unless we act and 
we act now. 
We must come together as Repub-
licans and Democrats in this Chamber 
and in the House to provide relief to 
the American people to ensure that 
workers continue to receive paychecks 
or other forms of assistance. Of course, 
we continue to build on the two bills 
that we have already passed to protect 
the health and safety of the American 
people. 
Looking beyond the statistics that I 
just recited, the real world effect of 
this economic devastation is evident 
everywhere. I just got off the phone 
from talking to a couple in Lewiston, 
ME, Jimmy and Linda Simones. They 
run a third-generation family diner. It 
is well known and a favorite place to 
stop by for lunch. They tried to con-
vert to a takeout business, but it just 
didn’t work. So for the first time ever 
in this diner’s history, the Simones 
family is forced to close their doors 
and to lay off their workers—workers 
who have been with them for years, 
workers who include not only them-
selves but their son George. 
Every day I have heard from small 
business owners who are anxious about 
the future of their businesses and how 
they can continue to pay their employ-
ees who are often their family mem-
bers, their friends, and their neighbors. 
The last thing they want to do is to lay 
off their employees and shut their 
doors, but they fear they may have no 
other choice. They simply do not have 
the cash flow, the revenue coming in 
the door, to allow them to remain 
open. 
The tourism sector, which is so crit-
ical to jobs in Maine, has been particu-
larly hard hit. A small hotel in Bruns-
wick, ME, received 84 cancellations 
within 24 hours of the local college sus-
pending its in-person classes. A well- 
known Irish pub in Bangor, ME, had to 
close for St. Patrick’s Day, probably 
its biggest day of the year, and has 
been forced to lay off 60 people. A char-
ter bus company based in Lewiston lost 
$400,000 in 3 days because two major 
tours canceled. If tourism is further re-
duced, this bus company predicts losses 
of more than $1 million. 
Countless other businesses in my 
State—such as restaurants, the lobster 
and fishing industries, gyms, B&Bs, 
gift shops, retailers, and hair salons— 
have also been hard hit. The hospi-
tality industry, in particular, is at risk 
of being devastated, as conferences and 
vacation trips continue to be canceled. 
A hair stylist in Biddeford, a good 
friend of mine, was forced to shutter 
her shop, and, at the same time, she 
lost her part-time job bartending when 
the bar that employed her was also re-
quired to close. When these small busi-
nesses suffer, it has a cascading effect 
on their employees, from housekeepers 
to wait staff, to bartenders, to fisher-
men, to drivers, to retail clerks. These 
are just some of the countless examples 
of the economic damage that is occur-
ring in every community because of 
the virus and through absolutely no 
fault of the small businesses or their 
workers. But for the coronavirus and 
the steps that State and local govern-
ments have taken, as well as the Fed-
eral 
Government, 
these 
businesses 
would be thriving. In Maine, they 
would be beginning to start staffing up 
for the summer months for the height 
of the tourism season. 
It is essential that Congress act im-
mediately without partisan bickering, 
without delay—act immediately to pro-
tect the paychecks and to provide 
other relief to supplement the earlier 
bills that we have passed. 
I am pleased to report that help is on 
the horizon for small businesses and 
their workers that would allow them to 
weather the current storm. As a mem-
ber of the Small Business Task Force, 
I have been working very closely night 
and day with a group of my col-
leagues—Senator 
RUBIO, 
Senator 
CARDIN, and Senator SHAHEEN. Our 
staffs have worked literally through 
the night on legislation to provide re-
lief to small businesses and their em-
ployees. 
The Keeping Workers Paid and Em-
ployed Act that I authored with Sen-
ator RUBIO, the chairman of the Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Com-
mittee, provides a plan to do just that. 
Through our negotiations with Senator 
SHAHEEN
and Senator CARDIN, who 
have been wonderful partners—wonder-
ful partners—we have produced, joint-
ly, a $350 billion plan that would help 
mitigate this crisis. 
Our group has worked night and day 
in a bipartisan fashion. We have kept 
in mind the common goal of protecting 
those employees who have been laid off 
or who are at risk of being laid off be-
cause of the cashflow problems of their 
employers, problems that these small 
businesses did not create but, rather, 
are a result of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Our joint vision is to help small busi-
nesses and their employees make it 
through to the other side of this crisis 
by providing cashflow assistance quick-
ly to employers who agree to keep 
their workers on the payroll. This 
would allow employers to stay in busi-
ness and keep paying their employees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1898 
March 22, 2020 
have endorsed this bill. Additionally, 
nationwide, a group of more than two 
dozen business organizations that rep-
resent thousands of companies across 
the 
country 
have 
expressed 
their 
strong support for this proposal, and I 
would ask unanimous consent that 
both of those letters be included in the 
RECORD at the conclusion of my re-
marks. 
Let me explain how our plan would 
work. Under our approach, small busi-
nesses would be eligible for a 100-per-
cent federally guaranteed emergency 
loan to cover their payroll for 8 weeks, 
as well as certain fixed expenses—nor-
mal customary expenses like rent or 
mortgage 
payments 
and 
utilities. 
These loans would ultimately be eligi-
ble to be forgiven, provided that the 
employers kept the workers on their 
payrolls. That is the key provision. 
This financial assistance is targeted, 
and it could not be used to give raises 
to highly compensated employees or to 
increase returns to shareholders, not 
that most of these small businesses 
even have shareholders. 
Our goal is to keep these workers em-
ployed, to keep paychecks going to 
them, to keep payments for their 
health insurance intact, and to keep 
contributions that an employer may be 
making to their 401(k) plan intact. We 
know that keeping people employed 
and ready to get back to work, not sev-
ering that connection between employ-
ers and their employees, will cost far 
less than it would to try to rescue the 
economy after we have had massive 
layoffs and business closures. That is 
what our bill would prevent. 
The Secretary of the Treasury has es-
timated that if we do nothing and if we 
do not pass this bill in connection with 
a broader package aimed at preventing 
economic devastation, we could see un-
employment rise as high as 20 percent. 
Keep in mind, we are coming through a 
period where we have had record-low 
unemployment. It could rise as high as 
20 percent. 
If that happens, the impact on the 
Federal Government would be substan-
tial, far more than the $350 billion that 
we are using for this small business as-
sistance program to keep their employ-
ees paid, not to mention the extraor-
dinary harm that this kind of economic 
catastrophe would cause to millions of 
families. 
Congress has already passed two 
emergency relief packages. They will 
promote the health and safety of Amer-
icans, but it is going to take time for 
us to get the coronavirus under con-
trol. It is going to take time for the so-
cial distancing to work. It is going to 
take time for new treatments to be de-
veloped, much less a vaccine, despite 
the extraordinary efforts of scientists 
and 
physicians 
and 
other 
experts 
across this country who are all pulling 
together. 
Our Keeping Workers Paid and Em-
ployed Act has been included in a third 
package that I hope Congress will 
soon—very soon—consider to respond 
to COVID–19. It is imperative that we 
not delay. Every day that we delay, an-
other business like the Samones’ busi-
ness, their diner in Lewiston, ME, is 
forced to close their doors and to lay 
off their employees. 
We are truly standing at the edge of 
a dangerous precipice. Bold, bipartisan 
action is required to respond to this 
public health crisis and move us back 
from economic disaster and small busi-
nesses closing their doors—in some 
cases forever—devastating and deci-
mating our downtowns and millions of 
Americans losing their jobs. I implore 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to put aside partisan differences and 
come together and join our bipartisan 
group in delivering this urgently need-
ed aid for the American people by pass-
ing this important economic relief for 
the employees of small businesses 
throughout our Nation. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
HOSPITALITY MAINE, 
Augusta, Maine, March 16, 2020. 
DEAR HONORABLE SENATOR COLLINS: We are 
hospitality business owners and supporting 
suppliers, both for-profit and nonprofit, in 
Maine and we are writing with urgency re-
garding the COVID19 outbreak and its eco-
nomic impact on our businesses. We ask that 
you look to support small business owners, 
especially those in the tourism industry, 
during this immediate challenge. 
The spread of the virus, and the subsequent 
directives for social distance and quarantine, 
is causing widespread event cancellations, 
hitting the travel and tourism industry hard. 
Since the virus outbreak began to escalate in 
the United States, our businesses have lost 
thousands of room nights and advanced room 
reservations and thousands of restaurant 
reservations and many more walk-in cus-
tomers in just a few short weeks. These can-
cellations are immediate and will not return. 
Our businesses simply cannot sell yester-
day’s hotel rooms or restaurant meals today 
or tomorrow. 
It is crucial that any lifeline provided to 
small businesses address this immediate and 
severe reduction in demand. With the pre-
cipitous drop in reservations, hotels and res-
taurants around the state of Maine are under 
immediate financial pressure. We know that 
COVID19 is a virus and that it will pass. 
What is not known is how long that will take 
and what the extent of the damage to 
Maine’s tourism industry will be. In what 
should have been a celebration year to share 
Maine’s Bicentennial with the world, this 
Spring will bring a devastating drop in sales, 
already down tremendously in just a few 
short weeks. Assistance must be immediate 
and must be workable. Assistance must ad-
dress a temporary crisis and not be allowed 
to cause permanent damage to Maine’s im-
portant small businesses with overreaching 
and complicated requirements as some have 
proposed. 
Maine’s tourism industry is critical—Our 
industry contributes at least $6.2 billion in 
tourism expenditures, brings 37 million visi-
tors to the state per year, sustains 110,000 
jobs and contributes $610 million in taxes. 
This is accomplished through the hard work 
of small business owners and their remark-
able hospitality teams each year. 
The Collins proposal would provide emer-
gency cash-flow to employers so long as they 
agree to pay their workers whether they 
shut-down and lay-off their workers or re-
main open. We appreciate your under-
standing that our businesses should not be 
forced to permanently close because of an 
unforeseen, world-wide pandemic we have 
played no role in causing. You are also right 
to focus on protecting the jobs of our work-
ers—we cannot run our businesses without 
them. Finally, we deeply appreciate your un-
derstanding that our businesses cannot take 
on substantial, permanent debt when reve-
nues are plunging. Your proposal to forgive 
cash-flow assistance we use to stay in busi-
ness, preserve jobs, and pay our employees 
would allow us to reopen, fully-staffed and 
ready to serve the public the moment this 
crisis passes. 
Please act now to support Maine’s small 
businesses and tourism during the imme-
diate crisis with a responsible solution that 
does not further burden and shutter the wel-
coming restaurants, hotels and inns of our 
great state. 
Thank you for your dedication to and of 
support Maine. 
MARCH 19, 2020. 
Senator MARCO RUBIO, 
284 Russell Senate Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 
Senator SUSAN COLLINS, 
413 Dirksen Building, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATORS: We, the undersigned busi-
ness leaders applaud your efforts to support 
small businesses during this crisis. In par-
ticular, we support two key aspects of your 
efforts. 
First, an emergency loan program to sup-
port small businesses during this crisis, with 
loans made available through private banks, 
supported with a federal guarantee. Using 
the private banking system to provide these 
loans is critical, as small business needs the 
liquidity immediately. 
Second, including in the emergency loan 
program a clause that forgives a portion of 
the loan equal to an appropriate percentage 
of payroll (with an appropriate salary cap) 
for any business that keeps their employees 
on salary despite having to shut down. 
Small business employers are job creators. 
Small business employers want to keep their 
employees on salary during this crisis. A 
small business emergency loan program that 
includes forgiveness for an appropriate per-
centage of payroll for any small business 
that keeps their employees on salary will 
allow small businesses to keep America em-
ployed. 
This is not a bailout. Small businesses are 
closed and the employees are not working 
because of a government order. 
This is not as costly as may appear. Indi-
viduals who are laid off will receive unem-
ployment insurance. This effort would sim-
ply shift the payment from the unemploy-
ment system to an employment system. Our 
economy is better off paying someone to re-
main employed, rather than having them un-
employed. 
This has long term benefits. The disloca-
tion costs associated with widespread unem-
ployment are severe. Once a person separates 
from their job, rehiring is less likely. And, 
maintaining employees on salary saves on 
future training costs. 
This is superior to an outright small busi-
ness grant, as the money would be provided 
in order to foster employment. 
We thank you for your leadership, and 
hope both Republicans and Democrats can 
come together to support The Keeping Work-
ers Paid and Employed Act. 
Sincerely,

tion of Orthodontists, American Hotel Lodg-
ing Association, American Society of Ap-
praisers, American Society of Travel Advi-
sors, Angel Capital Association, Asian Amer-
ican Hotel Owners Association, Associated

Ms. COLLINS. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COL-
LINS). The Senator from Georgia is rec-
ognized. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
I want to begin with my gratitude and 
respect for those on the frontlines in 
Georgia and across America today. The 
doctors, nurses, first responders, em-
ployees in our grocery stores and sup-
ply chains, and our State and local 
leaders who are leading the response on 
the ground at this perilous time—to-
gether, this is the best of America. 
Now, 17 days ago, I spoke from this 
podium and called on the country to 
come together to combat the outbreak 
of novel coronavirus. I asked the 
media, my colleagues in Congress, and 
leaders across our country to join me 
in putting politics aside and to put the 
health and safety of all Americans 
first. 
The next day in Congress, we came 
together to quickly pass $8.5 billion in 
emergency funding to support our re-
sponse to this virus, which President 
Trump signed immediately. In March, 
the week after that, the President de-
clared 
a 
national 
emergency, 
unleashing $50 billion to further mobi-
lize testing, therapeutics, and care. 
Today we find ourselves in an even 
more serious and urgent situation. The 
health threat facing our Nation has in-
tensified. 
Recent reports show the acceleration 
of infection. At the same time, people 
are losing their jobs; small businesses 
are closing; and fear is taking hold, 
while families are home with children 
out of school, and parents are out of 
work. This is why we must act imme-
diately to pass the CARES Act, bring-
ing in well over $1 trillion, with an eco-
nomic impact being a multiple of that. 
We are in a rapidly changing environ-
ment with each passing day that re-
quires this immediate and substantial 
action. 
Each day, families are put more at 
risk and financial peril, and hospitals 
are going without the resources they 
need. Uncertainty rests on Americans’ 
doorsteps daily. They wonder: How 
much longer can I make this work? 
How do I protect my family’s health 
and welfare? We need immediate relief 
in the hands of the American people, 
and we needed it days ago. We cannot 
wait another day. 
To the families worried about paying 
rent and feeding their children, the 
small business owner forced to shutter 
their doors and lay off staff who is like 
family to them, those who worry about 
foreclosure by landlords, the employees 
of service, travel, and tourism indus-
tries left unemployed, the hospitals— 
rural and urban—and the assisted-liv-
ing facilities running out of equipment, 
staff, and beds, and the public health 
officials—nurses and doctors working 
around the clock on the frontlines— 
help is on the way. Every American 
needs to know that, in Washington, we 
have their backs; that we know there is 
deep uncertainty and fear; and that we 
are working right now to address it. 
We must turn our rhetoric into ac-
tion. I will say it again. There is no 
room for political maneuvers here. 
I want every Georgian to know I am 
fighting 
for 
them 
every 
day. 
No 
amount of false politicized allegations 
against me or my family will distract 
me. Nothing will get in my way of de-
livering much needed relief to Geor-
gian families—nothing. 
I have spent the last 2 weeks speak-
ing with hospital leaders, small busi-
nesses, 
employers, 
and 
employees 
across Georgia. The impact is felt by 
every Georgian. The need is urgent. 
From Lowndes County to Rabun Coun-
ty, the issues of health and economic 
concern are widespread. 
Across the country, we must stand 
together symbolically, though we can-
not stand together physically. That is 
why I am calling on the Senate to act 
expeditiously to pass this relief pack-
age immediately. 
Let me be clear. It is time to deliver. 
As we have seen, this virus does not 
wait for politics as usual to play out. 
Only swift action will save lives, fami-
lies, and jobs at this unprecedented 
time. 
Just as the rest of America has done, 
the Senate must step up and help win 
this war for all Americans. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I want 
to caveat what I am going to say by 
the reality of anyone who has ever 
worked on legislation; that when you 
make a deal with the other side on 
something or any group of people, they 
are always contingent on your having 
to see it in writing. Sometimes what 
you agreed to and what the legislative 
language that was written says don’t 
align. Oftentimes, it is not out of ill in-
tent or anything of that nature; it hap-
pens. So I want to make that point. 
I also want to make a point in saying 
that because we are dealing almost 
with the whole of the economy, as we 
discuss what we are going to do to help 
this country through this crisis, and 
you deal, for example, as we have been, 
with small business, it sometimes 
interacts with what other parts of the 
same agreement are also dealing with. 
For example, you might be dealing 
with a small business sector, but it 
interacts with what might be hap-
pening with the group that is negoti-
ating healthcare spending. And so 
items like that are things that you are 
going to continue to work through and 
have some understanding over. 
But I think what I feel very confident 
in saying, as you heard a moment ago 
from Senator COLLINS, is that a group 
of us who were tasked, from both sides 
of the aisle, to come up with what we 
could do to help small business has 
come up with an understanding of pur-
pose and outline of measures that I feel 
very confident every Member of this 
body should be able to support when its 
final version is before us. I am very 
confident that, if, God forbid, we are 
not successful in these efforts, it will 
not be because of what we have pro-
duced for this body. 
In that endeavor, let me first start 
by saying that I certainly feel both 
blessed and fortunate to have had as 
partners in this, obviously, Senator 
COLLINS, who has made a tremendous 
contribution. It began with her own 
ideas, and we were able to merge some 
of the ideas that we had been working 
on: Senator CARDIN, who is someone I 
have worked with on the Small Busi-
ness Committee but often on issues of 
foreign policy, and Senator SHAHEEN, 
who, likewise, is a member of the com-
mittee, but I have also worked with on 
foreign policy. 
I would just say that because of the 
nature of the crisis and the isolation 
that this building finds itself in, a lot 
of people weren’t able to see it, but I 
think if the average person were to 
walk in on the conversations that we 
had, you would have had trouble distin-
guishing who the Republican and the 
Democrat was. 
I don’t mean that from an ideological 
perspective. I mean that one of the 
things that I believe has allowed us to 
reach this point is that everyone has 
small businesses in their States—small 
businesses are not a partisan item—and 
that everyone understood that this was 
not a moment in which there was a Re-
publican side or a Democratic side. 
This was a moment in which the entire 
Nation was imperiled economically, 
and we needed to act quickly. 
Senator COLLINS spoke a moment ago 
and outlined the key provisions and 
ideas, but I wanted to reiterate some of 
them because I have a lot of people 
calling and asking if they apply. Let 
me start out with a few things. 
No. 1, small businesses are defined as 
either some company that has 500 em-
ployees or less or a company that is de-
fined as a small business under the ex-
isting SBA criteria. So it is one or the

S1900 
March 22, 2020 
other. Let me say, that covers close to 
60 million American jobs and well over 
30 million businesses in this country. It 
is an extraordinary swath. 
For the first time ever, we have also 
included most (c)(3)s—(c)(3)s and not- 
for-profit (c)(3)s—independent contrac-
tors—people who work on 1099s—and 
gig economy workers who consider 
themselves a business, even though 
they have one employee and maybe no 
real estate that they operate from, but, 
nonetheless, they consider themselves 
that. 
What it basically does, in its simplest 
terms—and I am oversimplifying sim-
ply because there are caveats to some 
of this with formulas and likewise—is, 
by and large, the best way to under-
stand it is as follows: You have a busi-
ness. You are a restaurant, a small 
one-person, one-shop restaurant. You 
are a dry cleaner. You are a mechanic. 
You have any small business, and you 
have less than 500 employees or fit the 
category of the SBA, as we define it in 
this bill, and the government has said 
that people can no longer go to your 
restaurant or can no longer go out of 
their homes and use you as their me-
chanic, so you have had to lay off your 
employees, so you are not operating, 
and you can’t pay your employees—I 
am not here to make fun of or criticize 
the big corporations because I hear a 
lot of them saying: Well, we only have 
30 days of credit available or we have a 
credit line we can draw down on over 
the next 15 or 20 days. I am not saying 
that is not an urgent thing that needs 
to be addressed, but the people we have 
been focused on in this part of the bill 
is people who have no line of credit; 
that if they go 2 days without revenue, 
they are in a lot of trouble. That is the 
overwhelming majority of small busi-
nesses in America, and, more impor-
tantly, in my mind, the jobs that they 
represent and support. 
So the program will work this way: 
You will go to a financial institution— 
be it at a bank or some other lender or 
credit 
union—frankly, 
anyone 
the 
Treasury says is OK and wants to par-
ticipate in this—and you will fill out 
very simple forms that prove you are a 
business, that prove you had payroll on 
a date certain, and you will receive the 
equivalent of 8 weeks of your payroll 
that you can prove you had, and you 
will receive this money very quickly. 
Hopefully, this system can set up and 
run. And as long as you use that money 
on payroll and/or rent or lease for the 
business, it is forgivable. You don’t 
have to pay it back. If you decide to 
spend it or any portion of it outside of 
that use, then a year from now, it be-
comes a loan, and you will have to pay 
it back at approximately 4-percent in-
terest. The Treasury might have a dif-
ferent program that works a little dif-
ferently. 
I mention Treasury because we have 
also given them the flexibility, in addi-
tion to using the existing stable or 
small business lenders in America 
today, they will also be able to attract 
additional lenders to participate under 
terms that might be different than the 
current terms, just because we need ca-
pacity. 
One of our biggest concerns about 
this bill is that we are going to have 
tremendous demand and not enough 
lender supply, not enough places will-
ing to stand up and operate to quickly 
process the paperwork and the like. 
The other important thing to under-
stand is that this is not a program 
where you are going to the SBA. You 
are not going to a tent somewhere in a 
disaster area or some government of-
fice or some government website. 
You are going to a bank, to a finan-
cial institution, to a credit union, to a 
fintech, to someone who will set up a 
process and an agreement, either with 
the existing 7a program or Treasury, to 
move this paper. 
The intent here is not to create some 
financial instrument that we can col-
lect loans on. The intent here is what 
is the fastest way to get this cash into 
the hands of small business so they can 
keep the people who work for them em-
ployed; so they can rehire, maybe, 
some of the people they had to fur-
lough or lay off, and they can keep 
them on payroll as opposed to going on 
the unemployment rolls. 
The other reason why this is impor-
tant, No. 1, is the jobs. No. 2 is, for a 
small business, if you lose your em-
ployees, if your employees go away be-
cause you laid them off, some of them 
may move away, depending on the in-
dustry you are in and so forth. Then, if 
you are told, ‘‘OK, all clear,’’ and you 
have to go out and rehire them or find 
people to take their place, by the time 
you get going, it is too late. Many of 
them will never restart. 
We all want this economy to recover, 
but you can’t have the economy re-
cover if you have no economy. And 
when you are talking about 58 to 60 
million jobs and over 30 million poten-
tial employers that are impacted by 
this, it is going to be hard to restart an 
economy if any significant portion of 
them can’t get going. 
We are dealing with some great un-
knowns. No. 1, we have never done this 
before. We did the very best we could 
under a tight timeframe and difficult 
circumstances. I am confident that, as 
with any piece of legislation, there are 
things in it that maybe we have to go 
back and revisit at some point—noth-
ing catastrophic. But I just want to say 
that up front. We have never done it 
before, but we believe this will work. 
What we do know is that, if we don’t 
try to do this and we do nothing, it is 
catastrophic. 
The second point I would make is 
there have been a lot of people who 
have worked very hard on this. The 
staff director on Senator CARDIN’s part 
has been sick. Some members of my 
staff this morning did not come in, as 
well, potentially just to be protective 
and be cautious. We are talking about 
a very small group of people who 
worked, basically, the last 72 hours 
straight on the SBA staff, Senator COL-
LINS’ staff, Senator SHAHEEN’s staff, 
and my staff—just a handful of people 
who worked long hours on the legisla-
tive draft. I know that, last night, they 
were here until 3:45 or 4 in the morn-
ing, as they were the night before and 
the night before that. 
So there has been a tremendous 
amount of hard work done on this, and 
we are grateful for it. And I have a 
product that we are proud of. Let me 
just say it is a product I wish we never 
had had to do, not because we don’t 
want to help small businesses but be-
cause, by and large, every one of these 
businesses that we are trying to help 
were doing just fine until 2 weeks ago. 
That, to me, is the most important 
point. 
These are not businesses that were 
failing or making a mistake, and so 
government is stepping in to prop them 
up. These were people who were lit-
erally doing fine until they woke up 
one day and were told by the mayor or 
the Governor or somebody else: You 
can’t open anymore. You can’t operate 
anymore. People can’t come to your 
store anymore, to your restaurant any-
more. 
It doesn’t just impact the owner. It 
impacts the people who work for them. 
I will close with this. One of the 
unique things about small business is 
that, in a small business, the owner of 
the small business is the President and 
the CEO, but they are oftentimes also 
the cashier, the stock clerk, the jan-
itor, the driver, the accountant. They 
are an employee. 
In an enormous percentage of these 
small businesses, that small business is 
not just the place that makes money. 
It is the life dream and the life work of 
an individual or a family. In many of 
these cases, the people who work for 
them are not the names and the num-
bers on a ledger. In many cases, these 
are human beings who have worked for 
them for 30 years, whose kids have 
grown up with them and watching their 
kids grow up, who are like family to 
them. 
I have talked to some of these small 
business owners who have had to in-
form their employees, tearfully, that, 
for the first time in 30 or 40 years, they 
will not be opening and they will not 
be able to pay an employee—people 
whose businesses have survived slow-
downs, recessions, financial crisis, 9/11. 
In Florida, they have survived hurri-
canes—multiple 
hurricanes—and 
all 
sorts of natural disasters. Many have 
been open virtually every day, even the 
day after these storms, in many cases— 
until now. The trauma is extraordinary 
for them. 
Now, imagine the people I know— 
close friends, people I have known for a 
long time—who informed me that, over 
a 72-hour period last week, the husband 
and the wife were laid off, their two 
adult kids were laid off, and the 
spouses of the two adult kids were laid 
off—six people, one family, laid off in a 
72-hour period.

S1901 
March 22, 2020 
So they are sitting at home. Every-
thing is closed. They cannot go any-
where, and they don’t have a job and 
have no idea when this will end and, 
when it does, if they even have a job to 
go back to. 
That is the story of millions and mil-
lions of people who are living through 
it right now. 
It isn’t what the articles are about. It 
isn’t what the arguing is about. It isn’t 
what all the stories on cable television 
are about. It isn’t what the snarky peo-
ple on Twitter write about. But it is 
happening to millions and millions and 
millions of people, and they are scared 
and they are worried. And they are 
going to get more scared and more wor-
ried as the days go by. 
I will say this. I hope the Senate can 
act as fast as possible on something be-
yond just what I have described in our 
part of this, because tomorrow morn-
ing, all across this country, business 
owners, small and large, are going to 
make decisions. People who a week ago 
were talking about pay freezes and hir-
ing freezes are now talking about lay-
offs, and maybe a few of them are hold-
ing on to see what we do or fail to do. 
But I caution everyone that, if we do 
not get something done, if we think 
that we have the luxury and the ben-
efit of time to play games and for 
gamesmanship and bargaining and try-
ing to get a little bit more out of the 
deal, in a few hours some important 
businesses and a lot of small ones are 
going to make decisions about whether 
or not they are going to lay off and fire 
and let go of a bunch of people. 
We don’t know what that number 
looks like tomorrow morning and in 
the week to come. Keep that in mind as 
we decide not just how we are going to 
vote in a few minutes but what we are 
going to do here over the next few 
hours. 
We do not have time on our side. We 
do not have the luxury of time to nego-
tiate. I think this is a process in which 
there has been a tremendous amount of 
input. I haven’t been involved in all of 
the other sectors, but I can tell you 
that in ours I am very proud of the 
work of all these Senators with whom 
we have worked. Obviously, there is al-
ways a little bit of tightening you have 
to do as the language is written, but I 
believe that, when it is all said and 
done, we will put before the Senate a 
product that will help millions of small 
businesses and tens of millions of 
American workers to be able to con-
tinue to draw a paycheck during this 
very difficult time. 
I hope that will earn the support—as 
it should—of every Member of the Sen-
ate and, then, every Member of the 
House. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
colleagues, as everyone now knows, the 
coronavirus has arrived here in the 
Senate. There are at least five Sen-
ators who are in self-quarantine at the 
moment. 
The discussions continue on the 
package that we have been working on, 
on a bipartisan basis, over the last 2 
days. It is time to move forward, and 
the next step is the vote we are going 
to have at 6 o’clock. No one is dis-
advantaged by having that vote be-
cause, by getting cloture on the shell 
that we are having the vote on, there is 
time—what we call postcloture time— 
after that vote. So it doesn’t interfere 
with any further discussions that are 
going on, on a bipartisan basis. 
We need to signal to the public that 
we are ready to get this job done, and 
the way to do that is to vote aye in 5 
minutes on cloture on the motion to 
proceed. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby 
move to bring to a close debate on the mo-

MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
enter a motion to reconsider the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is entered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
American people are watching this 
spectacle. I am told the futures market 
is down 5 percent. I am also told that is 
when trading stops. So the notion that 
we have time to play games here with 
the American economy and the Amer-
ican people is utterly absurd. 
I want to explain what just happened. 
Our good friends on the other side 
would not have been disadvantaged one 
bit if this vote had succeeded because 
it would have required potentially 30 
more hours of discussion, during which 
these seemingly endless negotiations 
could go on as long as they would like. 
Now, the buildup to this, so every-
body fully understands, is that we had 
a high level of bipartisanship in five 
different working groups over the last 
48 hours, where Members who were par-
ticipating were reaching agreement. 
Then, all of a sudden, the Democratic 
leader and the Speaker of the House

March 22, 2020 
show up, and we are back to square 
one. 
We are fiddling here—fiddling with 
the emotions of the American people, 
fiddling with the markets, fiddling 
with our healthcare. The American 
people expect us to act tomorrow, and 
I want everybody to fully understand 
that if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, 
it will be because of our colleagues on 
the other side continuing to dicker 
when the country expects us to come 
together and address this problem. 
Now, I changed my vote, which gives 
me the opportunity to move to recon-
sider at a later time. That is all I can 
do in the face of this obstruction. 
Look, I can understand obstruction 
when you are trying to achieve some-
thing. This obstruction achieves noth-
ing—nothing whatsoever—other than 
preventing us from getting into a posi-
tion where there are literally 30 more 
hours that they could use to continue 
to dicker. 
So at a time when the country is cry-
ing out for bipartisanship and coopera-
tion, and we saw that over the last 48 
hours when regular Members of the 
Senate, not in the leadership office, not 
in the Speaker’s office—for goodness’ 
sake, she is the Speaker of the House, 
not the speaker of the Senate; we don’t 
have one—we were doing just fine until 
that intervention. 
So I want the American people to 
fully understand what is going on here. 
The markets are already reacting to 
this outrageous nonsense. We have an 
obligation to the American people to 
deal with this emergency and to deal 
with it tomorrow, and if we don’t, I 
want everybody to fully understand, 
you have seen everybody who is on 
record. 
Now, I have conspicuously avoided 
trying to turn this into any kind of 
partisan effort for 2 days, but it is pret-
ty clear what is going on here. 
We will have this cloture vote again 
at some point of my choosing, and, 
hopefully, some adults will show up on 
the other side of the room and under-
stand the gravity of the situation and 
the need to act before the markets go 
down further and the American people 
become even more depressed about our 
lack of ability to come together under 
the most extraordinary circumstances. 
We have never been confronted with 
anything like this before. It is totally 
different, and we are not immune to it 
in terms of the public health risk. 
Coronavirus has hit the Senate today 
as well. We have five Members—five 
Members—in self-quarantine. 
Everybody understands the emer-
gency, particularly when it hits close 
to home. It is not just back in our 
States, but right here in the Senate. 
So I will say to my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle: Step up. Step 
up. Help us reach an agreement so that 
we can do what needs to be done for the 
American people no later than tomor-
row. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 
more than 48 hours of negotiations, 
there has been a lot of progress made 
in the subjects that are within the ju-
risdiction of the Finance Committee, 
which I chair. 
The results of these negotiations 
have led to decisions that will be in 
legislation we hope to vote on tomor-
row that would make sure that checks 
go from the Federal Government to in-
dividuals—all individuals—$1,200 for in-
dividuals, $2,400 for married couples, 
and $500 for each child. Those would go 
to people who need it—people with no 
income and people with up to $75,000 a 
year in income or a married couple 
with $150,000 per year income, with a 
phaseout to make sure that no very 
wealthy people or even higher income 
or middle-income people benefit from 
it. 
We are trying to help those who need 
the most help, and there wasn’t dis-
agreement from the other side that we 
ought to mail checks out to people. 
This would give Americans the cash 
they need to provide for their families 
and to weather the storm. 
This isn’t the first time we have done 
this. We did it in 2008, when we had the 
start of the great recession. 
We also provided for liquidity for 
small businesses and larger businesses 
by delaying some taxes being paid so 
that perhaps these people who, right 
now, are thinking should they lay off 
their workforce or keep their work-
force in place, being productive—to en-
able them to do that. 
We also made a very big effort from 
both the Republican and Democratic 
sides to very much enhance unemploy-
ment with an additional $600 per week 
for people who are unemployed, plus a 
lot of people who don’t qualify for un-
employment now would qualify for un-
employment insurance for over at least 
the next 3 months, with an under-
standing that if this thing doesn’t turn 
around in the next 3 months, getting 
people back to work, getting the econ-
omy up and running—with all of this 
stuff we are talking about, we are prob-
ably going to have to do more. But 
right now, the unemployment rolls are 
going up by the hundreds of thousands 
each day, and we have a vote tonight 
that can give these people some assur-
ances. And somehow that is not a cata-
strophic situation that we should re-
spond to? 
I don’t know what people on the 
other side of the aisle are thinking 
about, particularly for the unemployed 
and particularly for those who don’t 
have checks. What are we going to do 
for them? 
This package that came out of the 
Finance Committee will not solve all 
the problems, but, as the leader said, 
there are four or five other task forces 
that are doing things to make sure 
that small businesses can qualify for 
loans if they will keep their people em-
ployed. 
So I don’t understand this vote at all, 
particularly 
considering 
the 
good 
working relationship that I had with 
Democrats working with me on these 
things as well. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Democratic leader is 
recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want 
to provide everyone with an update 
about the status of negotiations on the 
third phase of coronavirus legislation. 
Early this morning, Leader MCCON-
NELL presented to us a highly partisan 
bill written exclusively by Repub-
licans, and he said he would call a vote 
to proceed to it today. So who is being 
partisan? He knows darn well that for 
this bill to pass, it needs both Demo-
crat and Republican support. 
Furthermore, when Speaker PELOSI 
and I said let’s have a four-corners ne-
gotiation, it was Leader MCCONNELL 
who resisted. So whatever we do here 
in the Senate, the House is doing its 
own bill. It made no sense then, and it 
makes no sense now. I said to the lead-
er then that would slow things down. 
So that is where we are. 
Most important is the legislation 
itself. The legislation has many prob-
lems. At the top of the list, it includes 
a large corporate bailout with no pro-
tections for workers and virtually no 
oversight. Also, very troubling in the 
bill are significant shortfalls of money 
that our hospitals, States, cities, and 
medical workers desperately needed. 
This is a public health crisis. It is inex-
plicable to skimp on funding to address 
the pandemic. 
I told both Leader MCCONNELL and 
Secretary Mnuchin that our caucus 
could not support such a partisan bill 
and urged Leader MCCONNELL to delay 
the 3 p.m. vote so we might come to a 
bipartisan agreement. I am glad he 
agreed, because we Democrats want to 
move forward with a bipartisan agree-
ment. Unfortunately, the legislation 
has not improved enough in the past 3 
hours to earn the necessary votes to 
proceed. Given more time, I believe we 
could reach a point where the legisla-
tion is close enough to what the Nation 
needs for all Senators—all Senators— 
to want to move forward. We are not 
yet at that point. 
America needs a Marshall Plan for 
our hospitals and our public health in-
frastructure. The bill should include 
much more money for hospitals and 
community health centers, nursing 
homes, and enough funding to address 
the coming shortages in masks, ICU 
beds, ventilators, testing, and personal 
protective equipment. 
The bill needs more money to offset 
the costs now being incurred by State 
and local governments that are prop-
ping up their health networks. We can-
not reach a point where our States and

localities are going bankrupt or firing 
public employees, like teachers and 
first responders. 
The corporate bailout provisions re-
main unacceptable. If we are going to 
provide assistance to certain indus-
tries, there must be far more oversight, 
transparency, 
and 
accountability. 
There certainly must be protections for 
workers. 
On unemployment insurance, we are 
glad the bill has moved in the direction 
we outlined, but at the moment the ex-
panded 
unemployment 
benefits 
we 
fought for last only 3 months. It was 
supposed to be longer. We need it 
longer. 
Now, let me be clear. The majority 
leader was well aware of how this vote 
would go before it happened, but he 
chose to go forward with it anyway, 
even though negotiations are con-
tinuing. So who is playing games? 
Our caucus is united in trying to de-
liver a bill that addresses this health 
and economic crisis quickly, and we 
are committed to working in a bipar-
tisan way to get it done—both sides of 
the aisle voting for a bill. We are enti-
tling our proposal, the Democratic bill 
that we introduced, ‘‘Workers First,’’ 
and we intend to follow through on this 
principle as we negotiate. 
The bipartisan negotiations on this 
package continue even as we speak. 
Secretary Mnuchin was in my office 
just about a half hour ago. Changes to 
the legislation are being made even as 
we speak. The bill can and must con-
tinue to improve. We are closer than 
we have been at any time over the past 
48 hours to an agreement, but there are 
still too many problems in the pro-
posed legislation. 
Can we overcome the remaining dis-
agreements in the next 24 hours? Yes. 
We can and we should. The Nation de-
mands it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we 
not only can and should; we must. We 
must pass this legislation. I was very 
disappointed to see that my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle chose to 
vote no on even the ability to move 
forward with debating this legislation 
tonight. To my colleague, the Demo-
cratic leader, who said this is a highly 
partisan bill, that is just not the case. 
Let’s put the partisanship aside. Let’s 
do what is best for the American peo-
ple. 
I will tell you that over the past sev-
eral days, through a bipartisan process, 
we sat down, Democrat and Repub-
lican, in four different task forces, and 
we put together the elements of this 
legislation. As a result, the bill before 
you tonight, the one we are talking 
about, reflects Republican priorities 
and Democratic priorities. I am going 
to take the time to walk through it 
and to talk about some of those so peo-
ple understand what is in this legisla-
tion. 
I was pleased to see the Democratic 
leader say at the end that he believes 
we can figure this out over the next 
several hours. He said 24 hours. I hope 
it is not 24 hours. We need to move and 
move quickly. We see what the mar-
kets are doing globally. We know what 
the markets are going to do here. We 
have seen what the futures are. More 
importantly, we see the impact in our 
States, among our citizens. 
The Democratic leader says more 
money needs to be put against hos-
pitals and States and workers. There is 
an unprecedented amount of money for 
all three of those in this legislation— 
unprecedented—and necessary, by the 
way, because we are in a crisis. But to 
say there is nothing here that helps 
hospitals, oh my gosh—I am going to 
talk about this with specificity. But 
$100 billion—$100 billion—is a pretty 
good start, and $75 billion of which 
goes to hospitals. 
To say there is nothing for workers— 
the unemployment insurance provi-
sions in here comes from the Demo-
cratic side of the aisle. It is the most 
generous 
unemployment 
insurance 
plus-up by far ever in the history of our 
country. It actually adds more money 
to unemployment insurance than the 
current system has. By the way, it adds 
eight times more funding into the un-
employment system for the rest of this 
year than is currently being spent. 
Think about that. That is not gen-
erous? By the way, we Republicans also 
agree that those who lose their jobs 
through no fault of their own should be 
able to get a generous unemployment 
check while we work through this 
coronavirus and get our economy back 
up and going again. 
Let me walk through some of this. 
This coronavirus is something that is 
urgent for us to address. It has closed 
businesses. It has closed schools. It has 
changed every aspect of our daily lives. 
It has left us uncertain, and for many 
Americans it has left them isolated— 
literally, self-isolated. 
It has put tremendous strain on our 
healthcare system and that is why this 
legislation addresses that. Our amazing 
first responders, our EMS, and our po-
lice officers are doing their part, as 
well as our physicians, our nurses, and 
other medical professionals who are on 
the frontlines combating this disease. 
God bless them. 
It has also done great damage to 
what was a strong and growing econ-
omy. Only a few weeks ago, we had un-
employment numbers that were at a 50- 
year low. We had 18 straight months of 
employment increases and over 3-per-
cent wage growth every month. But 
now—now—we 
see 
businesses 
shut-
tering. We see thousands and now mil-
lions 
of 
Americans 
unemployed 
through no fault of their own. 
The purpose of this legislation is to 
allow people to get back on their feet, 
to allow us to get back to normalcy. 
Extraordinary times like this require 
us to unify us as a country, and I see it 
in my home State of Ohio and around 
the country. Everybody has a role to 
play. Everybody needs to be practicing 
social distancing, as they call it, being 
safe, washing your hands frequently, 
using hand sanitizer—all part of the 
strategy of flattening the curve, as you 
have seen when you see Dr. Fauci and 
others giving presentations. It is to re-
duce our own exposure so that we don’t 
overwhelm our Nation’s public health 
system. We can all play a role in this, 
and in the end that would help save 
lives of our family members, of our 
neighbors, of our friends, of people we 
may never meet but we come in con-
tact with, and the most vulnerable in 
our society. If we follow the guidelines 
put out by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol—the CDC guidelines—we are going 
to be safer. We are going to save lives. 
It all depends on all of us doing that, 
but it also depends on what we do here 
in the U.S. Congress, both in slowing 
the spread through the legislative ef-
forts I will talk about tonight but also 
in getting this economy back on its 
feet so that people can get back to 
work and get a paycheck and begin to 
make ends meet. 
In Ohio we have been taking the lead 
on this. We have been pretty aggressive 
at saying that people need social dis-
tance and restaurants and bars need to 
close. We were one of the first couple of 
States to say that schools needed to be 
closed. Governor Mike DeWine and our 
Ohio Department of Health Director, 
Dr. Amy Acton, have done a good job 
in responding to this unprecedented 
crisis. As of this morning, we have 247 
confirmed cases and 3 deaths. 
By the way, the first person to die in 
Ohio was a man I know. I knew him 
and I respected him. His name is Mark 
Wagner, Sr., of Toledo, OH. He con-
tracted this disease and succumbed to 
it. 
Unfortunately, we are going to see 
more cases and more deaths, but we are 
doing the things to contain this and to 
begin to slow the spread, and that 
needs to happen at every level, includ-
ing here. That is why this legislation is 
so important to pass tonight. 
Two weeks ago, Congress started this 
effort by passing the first major relief 
effort, called phase 1, which was $8.3 
billion to address the healthcare needs 
associated with this pandemic. Ohio 
has already received $15.5 million from 
that first phase 1 legislation. 
Of course, much more needed to be 
done. One way we can find out what 
needs to be done is by listening to the 
people who have been most affected by 
it, and we have been doing that. I was 
joined by an infectious disease expert 
from the University of Cincinnati, Dr. 
George Smulian, on a Facebook Live 
townhall last week, so that we could 
answer questions from Ohioans about 
this crisis. He told us what the 
healthcare system needs. We know 
what it needs, and we are responding 
through this legislation. 
Last week, I hosted conference calls, 
while I was here in Washington, with a 
number of heavily impacted groups, in-
cluding the hospitals in Ohio and a 
number of healthcare providers, with

our food banks, with small business 
owners, with workers of nonprofits, 
and the charities out there on the 
frontlines doing all they can to help. 
We spoke to employers of all sizes. We 
had conference calls with hotels and 
restaurants and more. 
Hearing directly from these stake-
holders helped us understand what the 
needs are, and this legislation reflects 
what the needs are in our communities. 
We have to continue to listen to people 
because things are changing, and as 
there is an evolving threat out there, 
Congress needs to be evolving as well. 
Last week, we passed a second major 
bill called the phase 2 package, which 
provides Federal funds to individuals 
exposed to the virus to get healthy. As 
an example, if you want to get tested 
for the virus, that is now free. 
Our hospitals needed more resources 
to combat the health crisis. So we pro-
vided more care—more funding—for 
our healthcare network. I am glad the 
President signed that bill immediately 
into law. We also provided resources to 
State Medicaid Programs, to shore up 
hospitals concerned about losing rev-
enue, with no elective surgeries any-
more, and concerned about being over-
whelmed by an influx of individuals 
suffering from the virus. Phase 2 also 
provided needed help in terms of 
masks, gowns, and other protective 
gear, 
and 
more 
funding 
for 
the 
antiviral therapies that are coming. 
That 
is 
incredibly 
important—that 
people know that if they get this virus, 
they 
could 
have 
something 
like 
Tamiflu for the regular flu. That gives 
them a lot of reassurance and comfort, 
and it is necessary to protect the 
health of our citizens. 
That phase 2 legislation also puts 
more money into getting the vaccine 
as quickly as possible. It is not going 
to be here soon. It takes a while to get 
a vaccine going, but it will be done at 
an unprecedented speed because of the 
funding we are putting into it. 
It also provides for expansion of 
emergency food assistance, including 
for children who rely on free or reduced 
lunch from their school cafeterias who 
no longer have access to those meals. 
It also provides paid sick leave and 
family leave benefits of someone who 
had to leave work because of the 
coronavirus and who now knows they 
can still pay their bills. Most impor-
tantly, this paid leave is provided 100 
percent from the Federal Government, 
dollar for dollar, not on the small busi-
nesses. That is very important. Larger 
businesses tend to have paid leave, but 
now we have a way for everybody under 
500 employees to be able to get that 
paid leave through the Federal Govern-
ment reimbursement. 
It is good we acted on phase 1 and 
phase 2, as I have talked about, but it 
is clearly not enough. Things haven’t 
gotten better in the meantime in the 
last few days. They have gotten worse. 
A lot more has to be done to contain 
this virus and to help people weather 
the storm in the meantime. 
The crisis is unprecedented. In the 
best interest of public health, we effec-
tively have chosen to pump the brakes 
on the economy. We decided to do that 
for our country because it is in the best 
interest of public health. That means 
businesses of all sizes—small, medium, 
and large—are having to either shutter 
their doors or slow down their produc-
tion, letting people go. So many parts 
of our economy now are feeling the 
pain of this slowdown. 
Applications for unemployment in 
Ohio this week, as compared to last 
week, 
increased 
twentyfold. 
That 
means there was a 2,000-percent in-
crease in Ohio on claims for unemploy-
ment. Obviously, that is overwhelming 
the system. 
I have worked with my colleagues 
nonstop over the past 3 days to put to-
gether this phase 3 package that will 
provide some relief to the millions of 
American workers and small businesses 
that have made our country and our 
economy the strongest in the world. 
Our goals are simple. First, slow the 
spread of the virus. Again, if that 
doesn’t happen, people’s health is at 
risk, and the negative economic impact 
that is hurting so many families will 
continue. So slowing the spread of the 
virus is not just about the virus; it is 
also about our economy. 
Second, we need to help employers to 
continue 
paying 
their 
employees 
through 
this 
crisis. 
Our 
objective 
should be to keep people at work and 
keep them connected to their employer 
as much as possible. That is where they 
get their healthcare. That is where 
they get their retirement, for the most 
part. That enables us to be able to en-
sure that as we ramp up our economy, 
it can ramp up more quickly because 
people will be there at work. There will 
not be the process of hiring and re-
training. So one of our objectives in 
this legislation is not just to slow the 
spread of the virus but also keep people 
at work to the extent possible. 
And third, recognizing that not every 
employer is going to be able to keep 
employees. Even those who have some 
business going, don’t have enough busi-
ness. We want to be sure we are pro-
viding the resources to help those indi-
viduals. These are the people who are 
falling between the cracks. They can’t 
stay at work because their work no 
longer has any revenue. We need to as-
sist those people. 
Again, as we talked about, Ohio’s un-
employment claims have skyrocketed 
but 
so 
have 
unemployment 
office 
claims all around the country. The bot-
tom line is that our country is not 
going to be able to come back until we 
slow the spread of this virus. 
I am pleased to say that the phase 3 
package we have negotiated, by the 
way, accomplishes all three of those 
objectives—all three. We do it through 
four major policy areas. We do it now, 
right away, to bring relief to the people 
we are representing, which is why we 
have to pass this legislation and pass it 
now. 
First, in terms of helping people, this 
phase 3 package provides direct pay-
ments. These are direct payments— 
checks to individuals of $1,200 per per-
son. If you are a couple, it is $2,400, and 
then it is $500 per child. That check 
getting out to people will give people 
some extra dollars to make the dif-
ference in being able to pay bills, pay-
ing the car payment, paying rent, and 
being able to put food on the table. It 
will give people some comfort to know 
that there is at least a little help com-
ing directly and quickly. 
For those who are out of work, these 
checks also serve as a bridge to getting 
into the new unemployment insurance 
system I will talk about now. The 
checks are going to be necessary in 
that in most States it is going to take 
a couple of weeks—a few weeks—in 
some States several weeks to set up 
this new system. In Ohio, they say 2 
weeks. 
This is the most significant expan-
sion of our unemployment insurance 
system in history, by far. It is going to 
significantly expand the number of in-
dividuals who are eligible to receive 
benefits, particularly self-employed, so 
it broadens those who qualify for un-
employment insurance. These folks, by 
the way, have never been covered by 
unemployment insurance before. 
What is more, it provides a flat in-
crease of $600 per week per person in 
the unemployment insurance system. 
This means that for low- and low-me-
dium-income folks, let’s say 40- to 
50,000 bucks a year, they will essen-
tially have wage replacement now 
through unemployment insurance. This 
is a big difference. In Ohio, unemploy-
ment insurance is one-third of your 
wages for those same individuals. Now 
it will be topped up. 
So, to the point earlier that this is a 
highly partisan bill, I am sorry. This 
legislation reflects the priorities of 
Democrats and Republicans, and this is 
an example of that, and we have to ac-
knowledge it. 
Is the bill perfect? No. No bill is per-
fect, certainly not when we are trying 
to respond to a crisis like this. We are 
pumping out more of our Federal tax 
dollars and borrowing Federal Treas-
ury dollars than ever in the history of 
our country through this process when 
you add up this phase 1, phase 2, and 
phase 3. This is a bill that represents 
ideas from both sides of the aisle. 
Are there some things that might 
need to be adjusted by the Democrats 
in order to support it? I guess so be-
cause that is what we heard tonight 
from the Democratic leader, but we 
cannot start over, folks. This legisla-
tion does exactly what so many Demo-
crats have called for and Republicans, 
to help people have the financial secu-
rity and to pay their bills and to stay 
afloat. And, by the way, we also pro-
vide funding to the State employment 
offices so they can have Federal fund-
ing to deal with their administrative 
costs as they shift to this dramatically 
new system that is being provided

S1905 
March 22, 2020 
through this legislation. So that is for 
people directly. 
Second, the stimulus package is 
going to provide relief for small busi-
nesses that are trying to stay afloat by 
ensuring they are going to have access 
to credit and liquidity needed to adapt 
and retool their businesses to weather 
this storm. We are going to accomplish 
this in a couple of ways. 
One is through a major expansion of 
what is called the Small Business Ad-
ministration 7(a) loan program. This is 
going to go through businesses that are 
currently providing funding to small 
businesses. It is the community bank. 
It is the savings and loan. It is the 
credit union. It is the regional bank. 
Wherever people are banking, they will 
be able to get these loans directly. 
Specifically, we are providing hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in loans to 
small- and medium-sized businesses 
that they can use for a variety of ex-
penses, including payroll, including 
paying rent, paying mortgages. And, by 
the way, if they use it for that, the 
loan is forgiven. It really converts into 
a grant. If they use it for payroll— 
again, let me repeat—to keep workers, 
because that is one of the objectives 
here, if they use it for rent, and if they 
use it for mortgage payments, the loan 
is written off entirely. It, essentially, 
is a grant to those small businesses. 
This is why the small business commu-
nity is excited about this because they 
want to keep their employees, and they 
want to keep their doors open. They 
are waiting, and they are on the edge 
of their seats seeing what we do to-
night and tomorrow. I have talked to 
many businesses back home who are 
saying: I can wait until Monday, but I 
can’t wait any longer. I am bleeding 
cash. I have no revenue. I want to keep 
my people. I want to try to keep the 
doors open. You have got to give us 
some help. 
As I said before, the best way to pro-
tect workers and get our economy back 
up and running is to enable employers 
to keep paying their employees. This 
new program for small- and medium- 
sized businesses does just that. 
For businesses that might not be eli-
gible for these SBA loans, the phase 3 
stimulus helps provide immediate li-
quidity through a number of different 
ways. These are larger businesses—say, 
over 500 employees. One is through the 
Tax Code. Specifically, our bill in-
cludes provisions that allow businesses 
to put cash in the hands of companies 
so they can keep their workers em-
ployed and be ready to get back and 
running when the crisis is over. 
By the way, these tax incentives are 
things like not having to pay the em-
ployer side of the payroll taxes—the 
6.2-percent FICA tax. That is incred-
ibly important to these businesses. 
They told us that—give us a break on 
that for this year, 2020, and we can 
keep more people, and we can keep our 
doors open. That is probably the big-
gest single one here. 
But guess what. In 2021 and 2022, they 
have to pay that back. So the best part 
of these tax incentives is that the large 
majority of them are simply timing 
changes, meaning that while they are 
direct deductions in taxes now in 2020, 
when they need it, much of that deduc-
tion is going to be paid back in the 
coming years. Based on the rough esti-
mates we have seen, these tax provi-
sions could provide up to $500 billion in 
immediate cashflow increases, again, 
with more than half of that paid back 
to the Federal Government during the 
budget window. 
Third, the phase 3 package takes pre-
cise and targeted measures to relieve 
particularly distressed industries that 
are at risk of hemorrhaging jobs and 
closing down if we don’t. I know the 
Democratic leader said he doesn’t 
think help should go to businesses. I 
understand the Democrats actually 
want to give more help to some busi-
nesses. So I guess they will pick and 
choose the businesses. But in this case, 
these are the businesses we all know 
are, unfortunately, facing the possi-
bility of shutting down unless we do 
something. 
Think 
of 
the 
airline 
industries. 
Think of the airlines that right now 
have seen their passengers be reduced 
by 80, some say 90, percent. Think of 
the airports that are closing. Think of 
the hotel businesses. Think of the 
other traveling tourism businesses and 
entertainment businesses. So these 
folks will be able to access what is 
called the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
to get a loan. And by the way, they will 
have to pay back that loan, but it is 
the Federal Government stepping in 
and providing a backup so they can get 
that loan and be able to stay in busi-
ness. 
So those are the three aspects that 
help workers, that help small busi-
nesses, and that help with regard to all 
businesses. And then, finally, and I 
think most importantly, perhaps, in 
this legislation is funding and policy 
changes to slow the spread of the virus. 
Frankly, as I view this, this is to buy 
time. It is to buy time for us to in-
crease the capacity of our healthcare 
system. This phase 3 package ensures 
that the men and women who are on 
the frontlines of this epidemic every 
day get more support. It increases 
funding, which we have already in-
creased once, but an additional $4.5 bil-
lion for the Centers for Disease Con-
trol. Of that $4.5 billion, $1.5 billion of 
it has to go to the States. This is going 
to ensure we can continue to monitor 
and respond to this virus as this pan-
demic continues. 
I think this is incredibly important. 
It also sends more money out to ensure 
that we can get these antiviral thera-
pies going. Think of Tamiflu for influ-
enza, something that is key to dealing 
with this crisis as we begin to turn 
things around and is going to be having 
an ability to keep people healthier 
should they contract the virus. 
To me, maybe the most important 
parts of this legislation—because I be-
lieve in order to get our great country 
back on track and get people back to 
work, we need to have some sort of 
metrics in place. So maybe the most 
important part is to get better data on 
the true public health risk that is out 
there, and this legislation does that. It 
enables us to know, now that we have 
more and faster testing out there, fi-
nally—and we needed more testing ear-
lier—but now that we have that, how 
many new infections are there? That is 
probably the best measurement we 
have out there. How many new cases 
are there? This legislation provides the 
funding and provides the direction to 
support the public health officials at 
every level to get better and more ac-
ceptable results every day and report it 
to the CDC—from your local health au-
thority and from your State Depart-
ment of Health, those should be re-
ported publicly every single day. Also, 
all that data needs to come to the Na-
tional Centers for Disease Control 
every day so that we can know truly 
what is going on out there because we 
don’t have that data now. And to have 
that data, it is going to give us a better 
understanding to measure both the cri-
sis as it stands and the healthcare risk 
we all face but also to measure success 
as it starts to happen because we need 
to be able to measure that success to 
get people back to work, to get people 
back to their families, and to get peo-
ple back on track in their lives. 
So this bill provides an increase in 
funding for healthcare—a major in-
crease—in addition to what I just 
talked about. It provides about $100 bil-
lion for hospitals and all healthcare 
providers, with $75 billion being appro-
priated to HHS in order to support our 
healthcare systems in a more flexible 
manner and about $30 billion in Medi-
care payment increases for hospitals 
that are directly treating patients with 
coronavirus. This is what they are ask-
ing for. 
Finally, we have a couple of key pro-
posals that we championed over the 
years to support people with disabil-
ities, particularly in institutional set-
tings that are at increased risk of con-
tracting the virus. That is in this legis-
lation. We have the Money Follows the 
Person 
Program, 
which 
supports 
transitioning 
Medicaid 
beneficiaries 
from dangerous settings—which some 
of them are in where there is a lot of 
activity—into home-based, long-term 
care. That is important too. 
As I said earlier, these are excep-
tional times. Not since the influenza 
epidemic of 1918, 102 years ago, has the 
United States of America been so swept 
up by a healthcare crisis like this. I am 
pleased with some of the steps we have 
taken so far at the Federal level to re-
spond to this pandemic. We talked 
about them tonight. 
We have phase 1, $8.3 billion focused 
on healthcare; phase 2, beginning the 
process of helping workers and helping 
people get back to work and helping 
healthcare more; and now phase 3, 
which is an unprecedented amount of 
support from American taxpayers to

ensure we can get people through this, 
help them weather the storm. 
And, again, these are Republican 
ideas and Democratic ideas through a 
process where we had four task forces 
that were bipartisan. We worked long 
hours. I was part of one of those task 
forces. Now we need to get this legisla-
tion passed. The American people de-
serve it. They deserve a Congress that 
does everything in its power to mini-
mize 
the 
damage 
caused 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
So let’s put the partisanship aside. 
Let’s get to a vote on this package as 
soon as possible, not 24 hours. Let’s do 
it now. Let’s do it now. We owe that to 
the people we represent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before 
my colleague from the State of Ohio 
leaves, I would like to note one issue 
that he did not raise, which we have in 
common, and that is the issue of votes 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate in times 
of national emergency. 
Senator PORTMAN and I have cospon-
sored legislation to address this issue, 
acknowledging in our introduction of it 
a few days ago, that when we face 
something, as we did this evening, 
where five of our Senate colleagues 
were unable to come to the floor of the 
Senate and vote because they are self- 
quarantining at this moment, this 
could grow. Let’s be very honest about 
it. The numbers could grow to a point 
where it could reach an extreme where 
there is a question of an actual quorum 
for the Senate. What Senator PORTMAN 
of Ohio, a Republican Senator, and I 
have introduced with him on the 
Democratic side, is an effort to estab-
lish a verifiable technology procedure 
so that once the decision is made that 
we are in a time of emergency, that 
Members could vote and not be phys-
ically present on the floor of the Sen-
ate. 
If you notice tonight on my side and 
even on his side, there are some Mem-
bers who came to the floor quickly and 
left. They are genuinely concerned 
about social distancing and about con-
tagion. I understand that very much. I 
share that concern. 
So I would just say to my friend from 
Ohio, that we are certainly not going 
to call this measure, but I hope we call 
it soon. It is time for us to have this 
conversation about how to protect 
Members and their families, staff and 
their families, in the way that we vote 
on the floor of the Senate when we are 
facing a public health crisis, such as 
the one we have at this moment. 
I will be happy to yield for a ques-
tion. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I say to the Senator, 
I appreciate your yielding for a ques-
tion. It is not really a question but a 
comment to thank you for your sup-
port of this on the other side of the 
aisle. This is a bipartisan effort to en-
sure that we can be able to do our duty. 
As the legislative branch, article I, 
we have responsibilities here. This is 
our duty station. Yet, if we cannot be 
here, we still need to be able to do it 
remotely. And with the technology 
that we now have, we have the ability 
to do that, as my colleague from Illi-
nois said, in a safe and secure way. So 
I thank him for his advocacy of this. 
My hope is that we can have this as a 
possibility, should we not be able to 
gather. 
I think what has happened in the last 
several hours, as we learned about our 
colleagues who are self-quarantining, 
one who tested positive, as I under-
stand it, it is very important that we 
have that ability. So I thank my col-
league. 
I yield back. 
Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator 
from Ohio. 
This is a bipartisan issue, as it 
should be. It affects both sides of the 
aisle. We are all vulnerable, and if we 
can find a practical solution which re-
spects the integrity of the voting proc-
ess of the U.S. Senate, let’s do that. 
As we have drawn it up in the ear-
liest version, it has to be agreed to by 
both leaders, Democratic and Repub-
lican, to go forward and do it for 30 
days at a time, renewable for another 
30 days, with a vote of three-fifths of 
the Members to go forward an addi-
tional 30 days. So this is not a perma-
nent change, but it is a change that 
may be necessary if we face a public 
health emergency or a terrorist threat, 
God forbid, or something of that na-
ture. So I thank the Senator from 
Ohio. 
I know he is prepared to depart. I 
thank him not only for his remarks but 
the tone of his remarks because what I 
sensed from the Senator from Ohio was 
a genuine feeling that we can achieve 
this goal of coming up with this crit-
ical third piece of legislation and do it 
with both sides of the aisle working to-
gether. 
The American public has a very low 
opinion of those of us who serve in Con-
gress, as much as we respect the insti-
tutions—and many of us have given so 
many years of our lives to—but I think 
they have been pleasantly surprised in 
the first two measures that we passed. 
They were done on a timely basis, and 
they were done on a bipartisan basis. 
So when we addressed the issue of the 
resources to fight this COVID–19, when 
we talked about providing free testing 
and medical leave and unemployment 
insurance being accelerated and food 
and Medicaid reimbursement to States, 
it was done quickly, and it was done 
with both the House and Senate to-
gether on a bipartisan basis. I think 
that should be the standard. 
I am sorry we stumbled today. I wish 
the Senator from Kentucky, the major-
ity leader, would have withheld calling 
this vote this evening because I do be-
lieve that there are serious negotia-
tions underway, even as we meet here 
on the floor. In another part of this 
building, those conversations are tak-
ing place. 
I have heard a lot of speeches on the 
floor, and if you listened carefully to 
the comments of the Democratic lead-
er, Senator SCHUMER, they were posi-
tive. He really, I felt, gave me the im-
pression that even in the last several 
hours, there have been some steps for-
ward. 
There are key elements that still 
need be resolved, but I feel confident 
that we can reach that point, and we 
must. 
The first and highest priority from 
our side of the aisle, we share. He said 
it. We all would say it. We have to slow 
down and stop the spread of COVID–19 
in the United States of America. Un-
less and until we do that, there is noth-
ing that we can do to repair and re-
store this economy that has any prom-
ise. We have to reach the point where 
we have crested and start to see a de-
cline in infections in our country so 
that we can start envisioning the mo-
ment when we can get back to business 
in America. That moment couldn’t 
come any time too soon for me or for 
all of us across the United States. 
That is why we sent a Marshall 
Plan—that is what Senator SCHUMER 
kept referring to. A Marshall Plan for 
healthcare and hospitals was our high-
est priority. 
I will concede the bill that he has de-
scribed has substantial resources, but I 
must add, from my point of view, just 
listening to my hospital administra-
tors in Illinois, that it is not enough. It 
isn’t going to be enough. We are going 
to quickly see our healthcare system 
overwhelmed if we don’t invest now 
and invest dramatically. 
Many of these hospitals in my State 
have said to me—and they said it pub-
licly, 
as 
well—that 
their 
revenue 
sources, primarily outpatient treat-
ment and elective surgery, have been 
pushed aside because so many patients 
are coming through the emergency 
room door complaining of symptoms 
that are consistent with COVID–19. 
They have to take them as a priority, 
and they can’t schedule elective sur-
geries. So the revenues coming to 
many of these hospitals—not just in 
Chicago but across the State—have 
been compromised. 
So from a financial viewpoint, let’s 
make sure that this third bill we are 
debating puts an adequate amount of 
money in for these hospitals. They are 
our first line of defense against the 
spread of this virus across America. I 
think we all agree that should be done. 
I continue to be frustrated—and I 
know my Governor, J.B. Pritzker, 
shares this frustration—that all of the 
promises and all of the press con-
ferences that the White House and 
other people are having about all of the 
testing kits and all of the equipment 
headed our way have not borne fruit. 
We just don’t see it. We are waiting for 
evidence of it. 
We are not testing nearly enough 
people in our State. A State of 17.7 mil-
lion people is a State that needs more 
than 350 tests a month. So what we 
need to do is to make sure we do this 
and have the testing kits available so

we can map the increase or decrease in 
infections, and we can chart, specifi-
cally, the spread of the disease in our 
State, which I hope is moderated very, 
very soon. 
As for the protective equipment, we 
have people who are volunteering to 
make masks at home, we are so des-
perate to supply the needs of protective 
equipment at all levels. It is not nearly 
enough, and it needs to be done. 
Let me also speak for a moment 
about the role of the Speaker in this. I 
listened to the Republican Senate lead-
er speak in somewhat questionable 
terms, to be kind, about the role of 
Speaker PELOSI in this conversation 
about this third bill. I must say, it is 
pretty obvious that if we are going to 
pass this measure and do it with dis-
patch, we need to have cooperation on 
both sides of the Rotunda, not just a 
bill that is acceptable to the Senate 
but to the House as well. So when 
Speaker PELOSI comes to the table, it 
is important that she be there, along 
with Leader MCCARTHY and the House 
Republican leadership, so that all four 
corners are represented. 
That is exactly what Senator SCHU-
MER suggested at the earliest stages; 
that we have the four corners of leader-
ship come together with representa-
tives of the White House and reach a 
truly bipartisan agreement that way. 
So the fact that Speaker PELOSI is in-
terested—she should be. She should be 
more than interested. She should be at 
the table and involved in making the 
decision on this. 
Let me tell you that cash payments 
are important. We have never opposed 
them. We have said that we want to ex-
tend unemployment insurance. There 
is a proposal for that. The duration of 
this extension is important to our side. 
It is a critical element, which I hope 
we can quickly reach an agreement on. 
When it comes to the 7(a) loans that 
are going to be made to small busi-
nesses, Senator RUBIO
and Senator 
CARDIN have worked on this for a long 
time. I think they are very close to a 
bipartisan measure that we can agree 
on. 
The phase 3 effort that Senator MARK 
WARNER and others have focused on 
really takes into account certain cor-
porations with more than 500 employ-
ees who definitely need a helping hand. 
When it comes to the largest corpora-
tions, I hope you can understand the 
reservations which some of us have. We 
want to make certain that the money 
going to these corporations isn’t paid 
out in dividends or in stock buybacks 
so that someone ends up getting rich at 
the expense of a truly bipartisan effort 
to help the workers at those corpora-
tions, which are our highest priority. 
We can have restrictions so that these 
moneys are not abused and misused, 
and I hope we can do that as part of 
this agreement. 
Let me close by saying that I do be-
lieve we could close this deal. I don’t 
know that it can be done tonight. I 
pray it will be. If there are people of 
good faith on both sides of the table, it 
will be. If it is truly bipartisan, I be-
lieve we can reach the goal that we are 
all seeking. 
Let’s get this done. Let’s restore the 
confidence of the American people in 
Congress that we can act on a bipar-
tisan basis and on a timely basis to re-
spond quickly to what is one of the 
greatest challenges I have ever lived 
through in this Nation. 
The American people in our neigh-
borhoods, towns, and cities across 
America are proving every day that 
they have the courage and determina-
tion to see their way through this chal-
lenge—first 
and 
foremost, 
our 
healthcare workers, God bless them, at 
every level. 
The doctors, the nurses, the labora-
tory technicians, and those working 
with our elderly, they are risking their 
lives every day in their mission to deal 
with this crisis. We should do no less 
when it comes to our responsibility 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
And a word about our first respond-
ers, whether it is the police, the fire-
fighters, or those in the medical profes-
sions, they, too, are doing their jobs, 
regardless of the threat to them per-
sonally. So, in that spirit, we should 
resolve this matter and resolve it 
quickly. I believe we can do it. 
I believe there is a feeling of good 
will and determination on both sides of 
the aisle here in the U.S. Senate. I 
hope that it can even be accomplished 
this evening. 
I stand by what Senator SCHUMER 
said earlier. There is a light at the end 
of this tunnel. Let’s try to pursue it, 
both parties, and get it done as quickly 
as possible. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we don’t 
have the luxury of time here, and I 
think we all know that. Certainly, the 
American people know it. They can see 
it sort of just unfolding right in front 
of them. 
We have small businesses that are 
shutting down, which, of course, affects 
the people who work there. We have 
healthcare systems that have tremen-
dous needs, and obviously they are on 
the 
frontlines 
of 
fighting 
the 
coronavirus. 
We continue to try to make progress 
on a piece of legislation that really 
should have been proceeded to today. 
The vote we had earlier today was a 
procedural vote. It was, basically, are 
we going to get on the bill. And what 
you saw was the Democrats object to 
even getting on the bill. 
Now, obviously, as the leader pointed 
out, once you are on the bill, you have 
30 hours, if you choose to use it, in 
which to continue to discuss and de-
bate. And if there are things that they 
are continuing to work on, certainly, 
they can have the opportunity to do 
that. 
But the vote today, which you saw 
the Democrats oppose, was simply 
whether or not we were going to get on 
the bill—a bill that is desperately 
needed by our country right now, and I 
would argue that the American people 
are looking to us for action. And, 
frankly, as I said, we just don’t have 
the luxury of time. 
The Democratic leader got up earlier 
and said that this is a partisan bill. 
That is just false. That is just flatly 
untrue. 
This has been negotiated for the past 
few days now between Democrats and 
Republicans. Leader MCCONNELL
ap-
pointed several task forces, and the 
Democratic leader appointed represent-
atives from his side to serve on those 
task forces. They have been negoti-
ating elements of this bill now for the 
past few days. Frankly, what you see, 
the legislation in front of us, reflects 
that work. 
There is a tremendous amount of bi-
partisan content in this bill. The 
Democrats had ample opportunity to 
make their case and to try to get 
things included that they said they 
wanted. 
Just to sort of highlight, again, what 
the Democrats said their priorities 
were in this legislation—phase 3, if you 
will—it was about workers. It was 
about small businesses. It was about 
unemployment insurance. They call it 
unemployment insurance on steroids. 
It was about hospitals. I have to say 
that I see in this piece of legislation all 
of that. What they just voted to even 
debate includes all of those elements. 
In fact, if you look at what this bill 
includes, if you are talking about pro-
viding help to families and people who 
really need it in this country imme-
diately—$1,200 checks to individual 
taxpayers, $2,400 to a couple who file 
jointly, and that runs through income 
levels all the way up. If you are a sin-
gle taxpayer, $75,000. It phases out at 
about $99,000 for couples filing jointly 
and $150,000—it phases out after that. 
And then $500 for each child in this 
country. 
That was something that was a pri-
ority for both sides. Democrats wanted 
to have that in this legislation, and 
there were many Republicans who did 
as well. The President said it was 
something that he supported. So that 
was a bipartisan priority that ended up 
in this legislation and will bring imme-
diate relief and get dollars back in the 
hands of American families to enable 
them to deal with their daily needs 
and, as best they can, with the crisis 
that we have unfolding in front of us. 
Then you had, of course, a priority— 
a huge priority—for the Democrats, 
which was the so-called UI on steroids, 
the unemployment insurance program. 
I have to say that my colleague from 
Ohio, Senator PORTMAN, did a terrific 
job of laying out all the elements of 
this legislation, but, as he mentioned, 
unemployment insurance was a big pri-
ority for the Democrats. 
Well, there is a big commitment to 
plussing up, topping off, the unemploy-
ment accounts that the States main-
tain—$600 per week for 3 months into

March 22, 2020 
those unemployment accounts. So if 
you are unemployed in this country 
and you go down to the unemployment 
office in your State, what you would 
normally receive in terms of a benefit 
would be increased by $600 per week, 
per person, for 3 months. 
That was a huge priority for the 
Democrats and one that Republicans, 
as well, believed was important. So we 
have not only the checks going out im-
mediately that will benefit families, 
but we also have now an unemploy-
ment 
insurance 
program 
delivered 
through the States that will provide 
assistance to those who have lost jobs. 
Then, of course, we had another pri-
ority that the Democrats mentioned, 
which was that they wanted to provide 
assistance—much needed assistance— 
to small businesses. If you look at 
what is in this bill for small businesses, 
there is basically a loan program oper-
ated under the Small Business Admin-
istration in which participating lend-
ers, which could include commercial 
banks, community banks, and credit 
unions, as mentioned earlier, where 
small 
businesses 
could 
go 
to 
get 
loans—100 percent guaranteed—which, 
if used to pay payroll, if used to keep 
their employees employed over this pe-
riod, would be forgiven at the end, to 
the total tune of about $350 billion 
total as part of this package. That is 
what it adds up to. 
That, again, is a benefit that would 
go out for the next 8 weeks to small 
businesses and, if used to keep their 
employees employed—in other words, 
to keep them connected to their jobs, 
in hopes that, when this thing passes, 
those jobs will still be there. So that is 
$350 
billion 
there—$300 
billion 
for 
checks that would go out to families, 
as I said earlier, and $250 billion to plus 
up the unemployment insurance ac-
counts that the States maintain. Those 
are all benefits that will go out to 
workers in this country—to employ-
ees—to keep people afloat, if you will, 
until we get to a better time, hope-
fully, not too far ahead of us. 
So those were all priorities that both 
sides had, and that is just what Demo-
crats voted against when we had the 
vote earlier about whether even to get 
on the bill, whether to debate the bill. 
They voted no. They voted no en bloc. 
You saw, shortly after that, a signifi-
cant drop in the futures market. I 
think the markets, in addition to the 
American people, are looking to us to 
provide confidence, to provide a shot in 
the arm, to suggest that we get what is 
at stake and how important it is that 
we respond not only swiftly but in a 
bold and big way. 
So those are just a few of the things 
that were included in there that are 
Democrat priorities and represent the 
work of a bipartisan task force. 
Now, the Democrats have argued 
that perhaps there is too much in here 
in the form of bailouts. Well, there is a 
provision in here, through the Federal 
Reserve, that would allow loans to be 
made to companies that need cash 
flow, that need liquidity, and, obvi-
ously, those are loans that would be 
paid back. So I don’t know how you 
can argue something is a bailout when 
people are getting loans—businesses 
are 
getting 
loans—that 
ultimately 
have to be paid back. But that is a pro-
vision in the bill. 
But if you don’t have that in there, a 
lot of those businesses that, through no 
fault of their own, have been shuttered 
or asked to shut down—and I can use 
some good examples, notable examples. 
The airlines, basically, are not oper-
ating—10 percent, maybe 20 percent, 
but more likely, from what I am hear-
ing, 10 percent of their normal loads. 
They are going to have huge hits to 
their balance sheets. And there are 
other companies like those across this 
country right now that are feeling a 
tremendous amount of economic harm. 
The reason that is important is be-
cause those people, those companies, 
those businesses employ thousands— 
millions—of workers across this coun-
try, and if we want to keep people em-
ployed in this country, we have to keep 
those businesses functioning and oper-
ating in a way that will enable them to 
continue to make payroll. So, yes, 
there is a provision in there that helps 
businesses sort of get liquidity—a loan, 
if you will; capital, if you will—that 
will bridge to, hopefully, a better time. 
But those loans, eventually, obviously 
would be paid back. 
The Democrats were very insistent 
that there not be any corporate bail-
outs, not any bailouts for big busi-
nesses, and I don’t know how you could 
argue that what this includes is a bail-
out for big businesses. There is simply 
a mechanism—a credit facility, as it is 
referred to—that would enable busi-
nesses to have access to loans that 
they could use to keep their businesses 
up and operating. 
So those are just a few of the fea-
tures in the legislation that was just 
voted down—or even whether or not to 
debate it or not was voted down—by 
the Democrats. 
I want to mention one last thing here 
that the Democrats also voted against, 
even debated when they came out here 
and all voted against this. There is a 
significant amount of money going to 
those entities that we know are on the 
frontlines of fighting this virus. We 
have all said that the best way to get 
the economy back on track, the best 
way to see things restored to normal in 
this country, is to defeat the virus. 
Well, there are significant resources in 
this legislation that are designed just 
to do that: 
Seventy-five billion dollars going to 
hospitals and another $20 or $25 billion 
that will go to hospitals through other 
programs, a mandatory part of the 
spending. This comes through the ap-
propriations bill. So these are discre-
tionary funds. So there is about $100 
billion in there for hospitals. 
Twenty billion dollars for veterans 
healthcare. Of course, veterans hos-
pitals and healthcare facilities are 
really critical to caring for a critical 
group of people in this country, those 
who have defended and fought for our 
freedoms. 
Eleven billion dollars for vaccines, 
therapeutics, diagnostics, and other 
preparedness needs—in other words, all 
those things that we hear talked about, 
in addition to gloves and masks and 
ventilators, and those sorts of things, 
but also the money going into vac-
cines. Ultimately, the way we are 
going to beat this is we have got to 
have a vaccine. So there is $11 billion 
in there for that. 
There is $4.5 billion for the Centers 
for Disease Control, which was also 
plussed up significantly in the last two 
bills that we passed. The one most re-
cently, earlier this week, had signifi-
cant additional resources in there for 
the CDC. 
There is $1.7 billion for the Strategic 
National Stockpile. 
Twelve billion dollars for America’s 
military, which I think we all agree is 
a priority for everyone here. National 
security is always an issue that we pay 
a lot of attention to, particularly in 
the time of crisis. 
Ten billion dollars for block grants 
to States, just directly block grants to 
States. 
Twelve billion dollars for K–12 edu-
cation and another $6 billion for higher 
education. 
Five billion dollars for the FEMA 
Disaster Relief Fund. 
Ten billion dollars for airports—and, 
obviously, airports are very much im-
pacted by this complete drop-off when 
it comes to air traffic in this country. 
Twenty billion dollars for public 
transportation emergency relief. 
That adds up to $242 billion, on top of 
all the things that I just mentioned, 
going to things that we think are real-
ly strategic when it comes to defeating 
this virus and combating it and mak-
ing sure that those resources are avail-
able to those who are on the frontlines 
and doing that. 
So, all told, of that $242 billion, 75 
percent—or $186 billion—goes through 
the States. The Democrats have said: 
We need more money for the States; we 
need more money for the States. Well, 
this is a pretty significant amount, I 
would think: $186 billion out of the $242 
billion that I just described runs 
through the States. 
So there is a tremendous amount of 
support for those who are on the 
frontlines trying to fight and defeat 
this coronavirus. 
So I just point all that out to say, 
again, that it is a complete misnomer 
to say, as the Democratic leader did 
earlier, that this was a partisan bill. 
This is a bipartisan bill. I participated 
in one of those working groups, and I 
sat across from my Democrat counter-
part—or, at times, more than one—and 
with staffs, and we came to the table 
with a set of priorities, and they came 
to the table with a set of priorities. 
What this represents is not every-
thing they wanted, and it is probably

not everything we wanted but the 
things that we could find that we could 
agree upon. So this was a very bipar-
tisan process which incorporated the 
ideas of both Republicans and Demo-
crats. 
It is truly unfortunate—frankly, sad, 
a sad day, I would argue, here in the 
U.S. Senate—for our country that the 
Democrats opted just a moment ago to 
vote not even to get on this bill, not 
even to proceed to it, to give us the op-
portunity to continue that discussion 
and that debate. 
They indicated that there are still 
discussions going on. I hope that is the 
case because—I have said this before— 
we don’t have the luxury of time. We 
need action. We need action now—not 
later, now. 
The American people need to see re-
lief. They need to see confidence in 
their elected leaders and a willingness 
to work in a bipartisan way on a solu-
tion, perhaps many solutions—hope-
fully, included in this legislation—to 
the challenges that they are facing in 
their everyday lives. 
So I will say it is unfortunate we are 
not going to be on this bill right now. 
I hope and pray—for the sake of our 
country and for the people who are not 
only suffering from the coronavirus but 
those who have loved ones and those 
who are exposed to it, those who are 
caring for them, but also for every 
worker, every small business in this 
country—that the Democrats would re-
consider and allow us to get on this 
legislation and move forward in a bi-
partisan way on a bipartisan bill, 
which they helped fashion, which they 
helped craft, and that is critical to the 
challenges that we are facing in the 
days and weeks ahead so small busi-
nesses will have an opportunity to re-
ceive a cash infusion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator from South Dakota has said it 
well, and I just want to come down 
here today to echo that we have had so 
many misstatements made by people 
on the other side of the aisle this after-
noon and this evening that I just think 
it cries out for explanations. 
Senator THUNE is correct. This is a 
bipartisan bill that we are asking for 
consideration on, that we are asking 
that a vote be taken so that we can 
have the final 30 hours of debate and 
get to it tomorrow. 
America is crying out for this. The fi-
nancial markets are watching this. Our 
economy is teetering on the brink. We 
need to get this done. 
I, too, was in one of the working 
groups, and we had equal numbers of 
Democratic and Republican Senators 
in this working group, with their 
staffs, with their laptops. And much of 
what is in the bill was hammered out 
with the input of Democratic and Re-
publican members of this working 
group. There were a few issues, yes, 
that we couldn’t resolve, and so we 
kicked it up to the Democratic leader 
and the majority leader to be ham-
mered out, perhaps in consultation 
with the administration. 
But, far and away, most of this legis-
lation is bipartisan in nature, and it 
just pains me for, somehow, the accu-
sation to be made that this is nothing 
but a partisan bill written by the Re-
publican leader. 
What is this about? The American 
people need to understand this. This is 
about getting money to average work-
ers so they can pay their bills and so 
they can stay employed. It involves en-
hanced and lengthened unemployment 
insurance, and it is a provision given to 
us and designed and conceived by our 
Democratic friends. We felt it was 
worth doing, and we put it in the bill. 
Also, as the distinguished Senator 
from South Dakota said, there is $350 
billion for small businesses to keep 
workers from ever being unemployed in 
the first place, to keep them on the 
job. This could happen as early as this 
coming week. They would be able to 
use this money to pay the salaries, and 
those people would never have to go on 
unemployment insurance because they 
can still be on the job. 
That is what is in this bill. That is 
what we need to get to a conclusion 
about and send over to the House of 
Representatives tomorrow morning. 
Of course it involves checks from the 
government, massive checks—a mas-
sive amount of checks to middle-in-
come Americans to just give them a 
little something in their accounts so 
they can pay the bills in response to 
this economic downturn that we have 
had. It involves loans to keep Ameri-
cans working. This is something that I, 
in particular, was working on with my 
Republican colleagues and with Demo-
crats in this working group. 
The airline business in this country 
is about to shut down. Passenger rates 
are single digits. They can’t stay afloat 
with this. It pains me to hear our solu-
tion to this problem to keep airline 
workers working described by my 
Democratic friends as a bailout. That 
is what would happen if we were just 
going to hand over cash to the airlines 
to keep them afloat, but that is not 
what we are doing. 
What we are doing is offering to pay 
loans—quick 
loans—to 
the 
airlines 
companies so they can continue to pay 
their employees and keep them on the 
job and not put them on the unemploy-
ment rolls. 
These loans would be made at market 
rates. There would be no loan forgive-
ness, and they must be paid back—not 
a grant, not a bailout. It is offensive to 
me to hear some of my friends, who 
perhaps have not read the bill and are 
not as thoroughly versed on its provi-
sions as we who actually wrote the bill 
are, describe this as a bailout for cor-
porate America. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. 
There were some people asking us to 
make grants to the big airline compa-
nies. We rejected that on a bipartisan 
basis and said: No, these must be loans. 
Once the airlines get back on their feet 
and once this coronavirus outbreak has 
subsided, they will be in good shape 
again, and they will be able to pay it 
back—with market interest rates, just 
like any other business that has to 
take out a loan. But we have to get 
this money to them in a hurry. 
So I object and had to come down 
here and say that perhaps they are con-
fused, perhaps they haven’t read the 
bill, as I have. But it makes available 
loans to the airline industry and to 
other related industries that are crit-
ical to national security. 
If I might, let me read a sentence or 
two from the bill itself. This is bill lan-
guage that I am quoting: ‘‘The Sec-
retary may enter into agreements to 
make loans or loan guarantees to 1 or 
more eligible businesses.’’ 
The applicant must be a business for 
which credit is not reasonably avail-
able. They can go out and borrow 
money from banks. This doesn’t apply 
to them. But our airlines are going to 
need more money than that. This says 
that they must be paid back. 
‘‘[T]he loan or loan guarantee is suf-
ficiently secured.’’ 
Again, I am reading from bill lan-
guage. 
‘‘[T]he duration of the loan or loan 
guarantee is as short as practicable.’’ 
My friend from Illinois—I appreciate 
the tone that he and my friend from 
Ohio used in their exchange just a few 
moments ago. I do think there is a real 
possibility that minds of good will can 
come to an agreement tonight. The re-
alities on the ground in our country de-
mand that and cry for it. But again, I 
must take issue with my friend from Il-
linois saying that there were no re-
strictions on the loans that we are giv-
ing to the airline industries that we 
are going to allow the Secretary of the 
Treasury to give. 
He mentioned specifically that we 
need to prohibit stock buybacks. These 
airline companies are going to get 
these loans. We need to have a provi-
sion in the law that prohibits stock 
buybacks. 
As a matter of fact, that is in the bill 
that we wanted to take up and were un-
able to get the requisite number of 
votes for just an hour or so ago. In the 
bill, we prohibit loans from being used 
by the company to buy back their 
stock. 
Here is bill language: ‘‘(E) except to 
the extent required under a contrac-
tual obligation in effect as of the date 
of enactment of this Act, the agree-
ment prohibits the eligible business 
from repurchasing any outstanding eq-
uity interests while the loan or loan 
guarantee is outstanding.’’ 
So no corporate buybacks—we have 
answered one of the concerns the 
Democratic whip mentioned in his re-
marks. None of this money can go to 
increase executive salaries. It must be 
repaid, and it must be repaid with in-
terest. Our bill has explicit prohibi-
tions against any loan forgiveness for 
any of the loans in this entire section.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1910 
March 22, 2020 
This is hardly a bailout. We are offer-
ing a lifeline. Again, this bipartisan 
language hammered out by Repub-
licans and Democrats offers a lifeline 
to critical companies that would prob-
ably not survive. We do it by providing 
carefully crafted and restricted loans 
to protect the taxpayers. 
Without these loans being available 
in the very next few days, some of 
these companies will file bankruptcy. 
Many thousands of these employees 
will lose their jobs. We are trying to 
pass this bill to keep that from hap-
pening—128,000 workers in one com-
pany; 92,000 workers in another com-
pany; 79,000 workers in yet another. 
I say to my friends: Let’s negotiate 
these last few details and get this done, 
but don’t misrepresent this as a big 
giveaway to corporate America. This is 
designed to help average Americans 
who are suffering and threatened with 
the loss of their jobs. 
The majority whip mentioned the ap-
propriations portion of this. Again, 
this is money that is needed. Ameri-
cans need to know what is in the dis-
cretionary appropriated part of this 
bill. 
Let me just tell you, more than 75 
percent of it—$186 billion of the total— 
will go to State and local governments 
to help them get over the hump in this 
terrible crisis. 
I have been contacted by officials 
from State and local governments, and 
I told them that this bill has $186 bil-
lion to help them get through this cri-
sis. I thought I was going to be able to 
tell them that this would be enacted in 
the next day or two. Unfortunately, I 
was a little overly optimistic on that. 
There is $186 billion for State and local 
governments; $75 billion for hospitals— 
clearly they need it—$20 billion for the 
Veterans Administration; $11 billion 
for vaccines, therapeutic, diagnostics, 
and other preparedness needs. 
If there are larger needs, come and 
tell us that, and we will work with peo-
ple. This is a generous bill—$4.5 billion 
for the Centers for Disease Control, $1.7 
billion 
for 
the 
Strategic 
National 
Stockpile, $12 billion to assist the mili-
tary in addressing this coronavirus, $12 
million for K–12 education, $6 billion 
for higher education, $5 billion for 
FEMA disaster relief funds. There is 
$10 billion in it for airports—my col-
leagues have heard from airports—and 
$20 billion for public transportation. 
This is an injection of appropriated 
money to keep this economy going 
until this virus subsides. It is an injec-
tion of loan money through some large 
businesses and an opportunity, also, for 
the Federal Reserve within their dis-
cretion, under a program that has been 
established for decades and decades, to 
loan money not only to big companies 
but medium-sized companies and small 
companies under a Federal Reserve 
program, commonly known as section 
13, subparagraph 3. 
I will say to my colleagues: Before we 
come down here and make inaccurate 
statements, read the bill and under-
stand what we are doing. Understand 
that this is to get money to workers 
who need to stay on the job. This is a 
bill to get unemployment benefits to 
workers who are already off the job and 
an injection of cash into our economy 
and a prop-up on a loan basis with in-
terest to be repaid to keep the airlines 
and related business float. 
I hope we pass it. I know Americans 
are hoping and praying for this to-
night. Perhaps by the early light of 
morning, we will have good news on 
this. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor because I have been 
listening for the better part of well 
over an hour as my colleagues talk 
about the vote we had a little earlier 
and why it didn’t pass and why, from 
their perspective, it should have. 
Let me start off by saying that there 
is a sense of urgency, but there is also 
a sense of getting it right and getting 
our priorities right. The wealth of the 
Nation will improve only when the 
health of the Nation improves. This 
package, as presently designed, falls 
far short of what is necessary to make 
the health of the Nation whole. We 
need a surge at the end of the day to 
ensure that, in fact, we can have the 
frontlines—the hospitals, the medical 
workers, nurses, all of those—be able 
to achieve the most fundamental goal, 
which is to make the American people 
safe from this virus. This, in the first 
and foremost instance, is a fight 
against COVID–19. It is first and fore-
most because if we do not get the 
health of the Nation right, we will not 
get the wealth of the Nation right, no 
matter how much money we spend. 
There is a lot of talk here about mar-
kets. I have heard for the better half of 
the last hour-plus about markets. The 
markets are important; I don’t under-
estimate that. Yet what is really im-
portant is the health of the American 
people because when they are healthy, 
we will prosper, but when they are not, 
we will not prosper. When we meet the 
challenge of the pandemic, we will 
prosper. When we don’t meet the chal-
lenge of the pandemic, we will not 
prosper. It is very simple. 
First and foremost, this is about hav-
ing a robust figure for the hospitals 
and health frontline workers. This 
package, as it presently is devised, 
fails to do so. 
Secondly, this is about making sure 
that not just big corporations get the 
moneys they need, but that average 
working families and individuals get 
the robust assistance they need to get 
through this period of time. When you 
have a $425 billion—billion—fund that 
has total discretion of the Secretary of 
the Treasury with no guardrails, no 
guarantees for workers, no guarantees 
that, despite how much money we 
spend and give to large corporate enti-
ties, they will not guarantee the well- 
being of workers, then something is 
wrong. 
I have been through September 11, 
and I have been through Superstorm 
Sandy in New Jersey and the North-
east, and I have never seen anything 
like this. I also remember the errors we 
made after the great recession on the 
TARP and other related programs. In 
our desire to overwhelmingly respond— 
we still have that desire today—there 
were great mistakes made. 
How many times are we going to get 
a shot at a trillion-dollar-plus pro-
gram? We need to not only have a sense 
of urgency, but we need to get it right 
in order to affect the well-being of the 
American people in their health, in 
their economic well-being, and in the 
future economic well-being of the Na-
tion. This rush, in a way that doesn’t 
get it right, is dangerous because I 
don’t know how many trillion-plus 
packages we are going to have. 
When I look at the language in this 
present legislation, my God, it is 
shameful. It is shameful that, in the 
midst of a pandemic, the ideological 
views are seeking to be incorporated in 
a way that has nothing to do with deal-
ing with COVID–19—nothing. The de-
nial of certain health groups to be able 
to access funding at a critical time in 
our country has nothing to do with 
COVID–19. 
This bill has a $425 billion slush fund 
with which, basically, the Secretary of 
the Treasury can say: I like you; you 
get this. I don’t like you; you get noth-
ing. 
There is no transparency—no way for 
the Congress to know. Six months after 
you give a loan is when we might fi-
nally find out. That is unacceptable. 
We have to know, when we are making 
these investments, that they protect 
workers and that we are not going to 
have all this money, in part, be used 
for stock buybacks; that we are not 
going to see corporate executives have 
big increases in their salaries and bene-
fits. That is not what the American 
people’s taxpayer money is for. That is 
why there were votes against pro-
ceeding—because we have to get it 
right. 
We have to get it right. How is it 
that there are no provisions in the 
present bill for foreclosures or evic-
tions? People are going to face unprec-
edented consequences, not because of 
their own making, not of moral hazard. 
They are fired; they are left without 
any money. Are we going to evict them 
from their homes? Does that serve the 
public health in the midst of a pan-
demic? No. There are no consequences 
for that. 
How is it that we have no parameters 
for how the Treasury would structure 
loans? How is it that we have no work-
er protections to ensure that the very

essence of why we want companies to 
be able to sustain themselves—and we 
do, small, medium, and big—we want 
them to sustain themselves, but we 
want them to sustain themselves for 
what? To be able to keep workers em-
ployed and to be able to keep the econ-
omy going, not to improve simply the 
bottom line. 
Why is it that we can’t have solid 
stock buyback language, which could 
be waived under the present legislation 
by Treasury? Why is it that, when we 
do talk in this limited way in the bill 
that is existing, that we are debating, 
that we voted not to proceed on, it says 
worker protections to the extent pos-
sible or practicable, I should say—to 
the extent practicable? That can mean 
anything. That is not a protection. 
Why do we have no loan trans-
parency? We are talking about giving 
average Americans a morsel when we 
are spending billions of dollars with no 
transparency 
whatsoever, 
with 
no 
guardrails, with no conditions. That is 
simply wrong. This is a bill without 
warrants that can ensure that the gov-
ernment—the government meaning the 
U.S. taxpayer—will recover its money. 
These are simply not ways that we 
can—why is there no student loan for-
giveness, not a delay but forgiveness? 
Why is there no direct grant assistance 
to small businesses? It is great to get a 
loan if you are making money, but if 
you are not making money, a loan 
doesn’t do anything for you because 
you can’t pay it back because there is 
no revenue coming in. 
The small businesses are really the 
backbone of the Nation. They are the 
backbone 
that 
ultimately 
employs 
Americans, and we say: We are going to 
give you a loan. 
That is great, but I have no income 
coming in. I am shut down. How is it 
that a loan is going to ultimately be 
able to help me survive so that I can 
have Americans return back to a job? I 
need some direct grant assistance. 
Who is on the frontline? I learned on 
September 11—when I was in the other 
body in the House of Representatives— 
that it wasn’t the Federal Government 
that responded on that fateful day. It 
was the States; it was the local munici-
palities. We lost 700 citizens in New 
Jersey on September 11. We triaged 
people from downtown Manhattan into 
New Jersey hospitals. It wasn’t the 
Federal Government that responded; it 
was the States and local municipali-
ties. 
How is it that you cannot be forceful 
in giving a significant amount of 
money to States and local municipali-
ties that are at the frontline of COVID– 
19? 
The 
Federal Government isn’t 
there. The States are burning up enor-
mous amounts of money from their 
State treasuries to do what is right by 
their citizens, but we are not giving 
them any money. There is virtually 
nothing in this bill for that. The Na-
tional Governors Association—Repub-
lican and Democratic Governors—say 
they need at least $150 to $200 billion. 
They get a pittance in this bill. How 
are they, as the frontline defense, 
going to continue to meet this chal-
lenge? They will go bankrupt. 
How is it that there is no SNAP in-
crease for the most vulnerable in our 
society? We have never seen a down-
turn in our economy in which we have 
not considered SNAP as a critical ele-
ment of being able to feed people. So 
that is why I voted no. That is why I 
voted no. 
I am all for helping businesses have 
the capability of ultimately surviving. 
I want them to survive because I want 
their workers to be able to survive as 
well. Above all, I want the American 
people to get healthy, and I can’t get 
them healthy unless we have a Mar-
shall Plan for our hospitals and pro-
viders at the frontlines. I can’t solve a 
problem if I don’t have the States and 
municipalities able to achieve what 
they critically need as the Federal 
Government waits. We can’t have the 
health of the Nation unless we have a 
surge on testing protective equipment 
for our first line of defense and then, 
ultimately, unless those who face the 
greatest risk under this virus have a 
shot at surviving life or death with 
ventilators. This bill falls short in all 
of those regards. 
None of us want to vote no to pro-
ceed, but we can’t proceed to some-
thing that is a false hope to the Amer-
ican people. We have to do what is 
right. What is right is to protect the 
health of the American people—be able 
to beat COVID–19—and be able to stand 
up individuals, families, workers, and 
companies that will honor their obliga-
tion to workers as part of the Federal 
response to them and that will help the 
States and municipalities in their 
frontline challenges. That is why we 
could not vote to proceed. 
That is why there exists a precious 
moment. Every other bill started off 
with both Houses and the leadership of 
both Houses negotiating the bills. The 
first two iterations had bipartisan sup-
port because they were done that way. 
This one was done whereby the Repub-
lican majority in the Senate decided, 
We are going to decide what we want to 
see. Then we will offer it to you, and 
maybe we will change some things or 
not. 
In the midst of a pandemic, that is 
not the way to, ultimately, work. We 
lost nearly a week. Instead of making 
the bipartisan efforts that we could 
have made nearly a week ago, we are 
pressed and have created this drama 
that, if it is not done right now, there 
will be a consequence. That is unac-
ceptable. We have to get this right. We 
are not going to get multiple shots at 
trillion-dollar programs. We have to 
get this right. Ultimately, we have to 
have the effect of helping the American 
people survive the critical challenges 
before them. 
That is what is before the Senate 
now. I hope that the minds will prevail 
here to work toward a bipartisan 
agreement that will bring all of these 
elements together. Yes, no side has a 
better view of how we achieve this, but 
both sides have critical views that are 
necessary. From our perspective, this 
is about beating COVID–19 first. It is a 
surge for our hospitals and frontline 
healthcare workers. It is a surge for 
workers and for protecting individuals 
and families. It is a surge for small 
businesses and the opportunity to 
make sure they survive so that, at the 
end of the day, people can go back to 
work. That is what this is all about, 
and it is why I felt compelled to come 
to the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I am 
here because I am absolutely shocked 
at what happened on this floor a little 
while ago, and I am going to try to 
convey to my colleagues a sense of the 
urgency that, I think, this moment de-
mands and that they, apparently, don’t 
understand because our Democratic 
colleagues all voted to prevent us from 
considering this legislation. So let me 
start with the context within which we 
are operating because it is unbeliev-
able. I wouldn’t think I would need to 
go through this. 
Just to be clear, we have been in-
vaded by a potentially lethal species— 
a virus that is infecting Americans now 
by the tens of thousands. It is growing 
in numbers every day. It is killing 
Americans, including in my State. We 
have infected people in every single 
one of our States, and the numbers are 
growing rapidly. In response to this 
threat, we have been taking progres-
sively more serious measures because 
of the degree of the danger that we 
fear—the disaster, the illness, the 
death—if we don’t try to stop this 
virus. We have gone to an extreme that 
I will just candidly acknowledge that I 
never could have imagined. 
What I am talking about is, among 
other things, the fact that my State of 
Pennsylvania and many other States 
across America are closed. I could 
never have imagined my even putting 
that sentence together. My State is 
closed. What does that even mean? I 
will tell you what it means. It means it 
is not legal to operate a business in 
Pennsylvania. It is not legal to go to 
work in the morning. Tomorrow morn-
ing, at 8 o’clock, there will only be a 
very small percentage of Pennsylva-
nians who will even be allowed to go to 
work. We have shut down the State. I 
am not talking about restaurants and 
bars and nightclubs. I am talking 
about 
all 
businesses 
except 
those 
deemed essential and a very small 
handful of others. I am talking about

March 22, 2020 
factories, distribution centers, ware-
houses—all kinds of producers, manu-
facturers, and services. Across the 
board, it is closed. 
What does that mean? It means an 
awful lot of things, but the most im-
portant thing it means is that the guy 
who wakes up tomorrow morning and 
can’t go to work, what is he supposed 
to do? How is he going to support his 
family? It is not that he doesn’t want 
to get a paycheck. It is not that he 
doesn’t want to go to work—he is not 
allowed. He is going to have no income 
pretty soon because—guess what—the 
company that he works for is not al-
lowed to have any sales. It is closed by 
order of the government. It is not just 
in Pennsylvania. This is in, I think, 
more than half of all of our States at 
this point—more than half of the coun-
try—and the number is growing every 
day. 
So this guy, like almost everybody 
across my State—men and women—is 
beside himself. They are all terrified 
because they know that they still have 
to put food on the table; that they still 
have to pay the rent or a mortgage; 
that they still have to clothe their 
kids; that they still have all of the or-
dinary expenses of living and are not 
allowed to earn a living because of the 
extreme measures we are taking to try 
to avoid an absolute catastrophe with 
this disease. 
That is why so many of us in this 
body have worked so hard for several 
weeks now—but very, very intensively 
in these last few days—to try to deal 
with this fact that we have a poten-
tially lethal threat and an economy 
that is disappearing. I mean, literally, 
the bottom has fallen out—it is going 
away—and that is enormously dev-
astating to the people we represent. So, 
quite sensibly, we have said we need to 
focus on these individuals first—the 
men and women, the families—who are, 
as I said, terrified and understandably. 
So what did we do? 
Last week, we passed a bill that went 
right at, first and foremost, the people 
most directly affected by this. Paid 
medical leave at full salary for a cou-
ple weeks, paid leave thereafter, paid 
family leave if you are looking after 
someone who is affected by this, in-
cluding if it is your kids because they 
can’t go to school because the schools 
are also closed. 
But that wasn’t all we did. We also 
bumped up the Federal share of our 
Medicaid Program—the program that 
pays for healthcare for low-income and 
poor people. We increased the share 
that the Federal Government would 
pay for that. 
We increased food stamps. We were 
trying to find ways, and we did, and we 
passed it. It was an overwhelming bi-
partisan vote. That is done. That was 
last week. 
But we recognized that that is not 
enough under these circumstances be-
cause things just keep getting worse. 
So we took up the bill that we put on 
the Senate floor today. This had huge 
section sections designed also to help 
these individuals, these families, these 
men and women who just can’t even go 
to work. 
One of the things we did was we made 
the unemployment insurance program 
much more generous. We dramatically 
increased the payments that you are 
able to get if you are unemployed be-
cause we realize there are going to be 
huge numbers of people who are not le-
gally allowed to be employed, in a way. 
So several hundred dollars a week or 
more above and beyond what is already 
there is in this bill that our Demo-
cratic colleagues voted against. Sev-
eral hundred dollars of additional pay-
ments every week to someone who is 
unemployed. 
But that is not all we did for individ-
uals. We recognize it is going to take a 
little while for those changes to work 
their way through the system. So we 
said, What is the fastest thing we can 
do to get money in the hands of these 
poor folks who are wondering how they 
are going to make the next car pay-
ment. What we did is we said we are 
going to send a check in the mail, that 
is what we are going to do, to low- and 
middle-income wage earners, a signifi-
cant check. How significant? Twelve 
hundred dollars per adult. So a married 
couple would get $2,400, plus $500 for 
any children they have. A married cou-
ple with three kids living anywhere in 
America who are wage earners who 
have middle or low income, they get 
$3,900—$3,900. That is the check that 
would be arriving in a couple of weeks. 
If the check doesn’t get there, let me 
just make it clear why. It is because 
our Democratic colleagues voted no. 
They voted against sending that check. 
We thought that was important to get 
that in the hands of the people who 
need it. 
But that is not all we did. We also 
felt like we don’t really solve this prob-
lem until we defeat the virus. We have 
a healthcare issue at the heart of this. 
We recognize that. So we have all kinds 
of provisions in this bill, and many of 
the provisions were priorities of our 
Democratic colleagues because this 
was a bipartisan process from the be-
ginning, they know that, like the plan 
to boost unemployment insurance. 
By the way, not just the payments 
were increased, but we expanded eligi-
bility. We allowed people to qualify for 
unemployment insurance who, in the 
past, have not qualified—people like 
self-employed folks who historically 
have never qualified for unemploy-
ment. Under this bill, the one our 
Democratic colleagues voted against, 
they would have qualified. 
But as I say, we also focused on 
healthcare, and some of the things—I 
mean, a 20-percent increase virtually 
across the board for Medicare pay-
ments to hospitals. Do you know why? 
Hospitals are in trouble. 
One of the reasons hospitals are in 
trouble is they had to decide to dis-
continue elective procedures. So those 
surgeries that you would like to have 
but they are not absolutely essential, 
they are not happening. 
Well, that is how the hospitals pay 
the bills, those kinds of procedures. 
They are not happening because they 
need to keep the beds available for a 
potential surge, if it should happen, in 
coronavirus victims. 
So we recognized that with a 20-per-
cent 
increase 
virtually 
across 
the 
board for Medicare. 
Big expansion in telehealth. Why is 
that important? So that you can get 
the professional advice you need with-
out having to show up in an office and 
potentially infect a whole lot of other 
people. It is a no-brainer, right? 
A lot of money for some of the mate-
rials that we need to do the testing, 
tests themselves, money to create the 
swabs that are necessary to get the 
sample to run the test, free tests—it is 
all in the bill, the bill that our Demo-
cratic colleagues voted against. 
And that is not all. We have $75 bil-
lion for hospitals in other forms above 
and beyond the 20-percent increase in 
Medicare—$75 billion. I can tell you for 
sure, every hospital in Pennsylvania 
wants that, needs that. Actually, I 
know that is the case for hospitals all 
across America, but our Democratic 
colleagues voted against sending $75 
billion to our hospitals at a moment 
when they desperately need it. 
Eleven billion dollars for vaccines 
and treatment. Look, this is the ulti-
mate solution, right? When we have an 
ability to treat this virus so that if you 
are infected you are not really harmed 
because there is a medicine that will 
take care of it, that is ultimately a 
really important goal. 
But we don’t have that yet. We don’t 
know what that is yet. We need to fund 
the research and development of that 
medicine that will turn this into a 
minor nuisance rather than a threat 
against our lives. 
And how about vaccines? One day we 
will have a vaccine. I want that day 
really, really soon. So we have got $11 
billion in this bill to accelerate the de-
velopment of therapies and vaccines. 
That would be the bill that our Demo-
cratic colleagues voted no on earlier 
today. 
Five billion dollars for the FEMA 
Disaster Relief Fund because they have 
all kinds of expenses they are incurring 
as they try to address this. 
Ten billion dollars to keep our air-
ports open because they are not getting 
the revenue that they normally get in 
the form of the taxes on the ticket be-
cause nobody is flying. There are no 
flights; there are no passengers; so 
there is no revenue. But we need to 
keep those airports viable for the mo-
ment we can begin our restoration, our 
recovery. So we have $10 billion there. 
We have $20 billion for public transit. 
I have been hearing from the folks who 
operate the public transit across Penn-
sylvania. They have the same problem 
everyone else has in one form or an-
other. They are hemorrhaging cash be-
cause they are trying to pay their

workers, but they don’t have the rev-
enue coming in. So we have $20 billion 
to help out with the public transit, 
which is absolutely essential in our big 
cities, but it is vital all across our 
country—$20 
billion. 
They 
voted 
against that. 
So we focused on individuals and 
families, first and foremost. We focused 
on what can we be doing, everything 
we can—many ideas from our col-
leagues on the other side—about how 
we can improve our ability to defeat 
this virus. 
And yet there is another thing in this 
bill. The other thing in the bill is to 
make sure there is a job to go back to 
for the men and women who wake up 
tomorrow morning and don’t have a job 
to go do. When this finally passes, I 
think it would be a good idea if the 
company that has been employing 
these folks still exists. 
Now, how is that going to happen 
when they are not allowed to have any 
revenue? They are closed. Well, we 
have developed a plan in this bill to ad-
dress this. 
So it is really kind of two compo-
nents. For small businesses, there is a 
program that has the effect that, at 
the end of the day, the Federal Govern-
ment is going to pay for payroll for 
small business. That is amazing when 
you think about that. Nobody has ever 
imagined this before. The Federal Gov-
ernment is going to pay the payroll for 
small businesses as long as they keep 
their employees on the payroll. 
The mechanism is a loan, which they 
will use to make the payments, and 
then they don’t have to pay back the 
loan as long as they did, in fact, keep 
their workers on the payroll. 
So we have offered, in this bill, to 
pay to keep people on the payroll of 
small business, and our Democratic 
friends voted no. No, they didn’t want 
that. 
Now, for large businesses, we took a 
different approach. We said we can’t 
actually pay for the entire payroll of 
the entire American workforce that is 
like 150 million people, but here is 
what we can do: A big company, if it is 
solvent, if it is a viable business, but it 
is in a cash crunch because—have I 
mentioned they are not allowed to 
have sales; they are not allowed to 
have revenue; they have no customers, 
in many cases, if they could. Think 
about the airlines; there is nobody fly-
ing. Think of hotels; there is nobody 
staying in hotels. But it is all across 
the entire economy. So what we did is 
we said: Look, if you have a viable 
business, we are going to have a pro-
gram where we are going to lend you 
some short-term money because this 
should not last long. You are going to 
have to pay it all back, but we want to 
keep you alive—this employer—so that 
when this is behind us and when we no 
longer have statewide shutdowns and 
when we are able to go back to work 
and go back to producing and living 
normally, it would be really nice if 
these employers still exist. 
So that is what we created. The mi-
nority leader derisively called that a 
bailout to explain his vote against this. 
This is not a bailout. It is ridiculous 
to characterize it that way. First of 
all, they have to pay back every dime 
that they borrow—every dime. It is ex-
plicit in the bill, in the law, that there 
can be no forgiveness. None of this can 
be written off. The companies that bor-
row this money have to pay back every 
dime. 
And let me stress, this is not their 
fault. OK? You are operating a business 
somewhere in Pennsylvania, and the 
Governor says: By the way, close your 
doors at 8 o’clock Monday morning, 
and you don’t reopen them until I say. 
Now, look, I am not trying to attack 
my Governor. I understand why he is 
doing this, but the point is, it is not 
possible for a business to survive. And 
we are seeing this manifested, this sort 
of easy, visual view on this that some 
of my colleagues have mentioned—our 
financial markets because they reflect 
what the world thinks about the future 
of our economy, and it is really, really 
grim. 
Some 
have 
suggested 
maybe 
we 
shouldn’t focus on that. That is not the 
focus. That just gives us a reading of 
just how bad things have gotten, and it 
is really bad. And when my Democratic 
colleagues came down here and voted 
against all of these programs and all of 
these efforts to rescue American work-
ers and families, advance our fight 
against this disease, and keep employ-
ers viable, I was just shocked. I just 
can’t believe that they would do that; 
that they would come down here—and I 
can only conclude that they don’t un-
derstand the urgency of this moment. 
I think they have to understand the 
nature of the disease, the severity of 
the disease, what that is doing. Maybe 
there is a lack of appreciation for the 
fact that at the same time our econ-
omy is being destroyed—if they con-
tinue this obstruction, and they refuse 
to let us pass this because they 
dismissively refer to keeping alive em-
ployers as a ‘‘bailout,’’ then a lot of 
these companies will fail, and they will 
not come back. 
You don’t just flip a switch and have 
a company that failed, that went bank-
rupt, and think you are going to turn it 
back on. It doesn’t work that way. It 
could take years or decades to rebuild 
an economy, and that means how many 
millions of Americans lose out on so 
much opportunity, on so much of life. 
That is what we can’t let happen. We 
have to stop this as quickly as we can, 
and that means, I am convinced, these 
three elements: focusing on individuals 
who are adversely affected, and now 
that is virtually everybody. We have 
done that. Done that massively. Un-
precedented scale in this bill. Focus on 
killing this virus, defeating this, devel-
oping the therapies, the cures, the abil-
ity to treat, the hospital capacity—it 
is in this bill. Look, there will be more 
to be done, but for now, this is huge, 
and we got these ideas from Democrats 
and Republicans. We put them in the 
bill. And then, finally, if it is a fun-
damentally solvent business, just an 
extension of credit for a few months, a 
loan that they have to pay back so that 
there is a reasonable chance they will 
still be there. 
This is exactly what this moment 
calls for. This is what we need to do for 
our country. I am hoping our Demo-
cratic colleagues will, frankly, come to 
their senses and conclude and under-
stand that there is no time for games 
here. This is getting worse by the day. 
We have to act now. So I hope before 
the clock strikes midnight tonight, we 
will vote in favor of cloture on the mo-
tion to proceed, the procedural vote 
that allows us to pass this bill as soon 
as possible.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-

Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
well, here we are, the eyes of the Na-
tion are on the Senate, but, tonight, 
Senate Democrats blocked coronavirus 
relief from moving forward. 
Republican and Democratic Senators 
just spent days collaborating in a bi-
partisan 
way 
with 
these 
working 
groups that we set up. Democratic 
ideas were incorporated, major changes 
were made at their request, but, today, 
the Speaker of the House, is back in 
town after taking a week off, and 
poured cold water on the whole bipar-
tisan process. 
Incredibly, what we witnessed a few 
hours ago is Senate Democrats voting 
to filibuster the bipartisan package 
that they helped craft over the last two 
days. It wasn’t even a vote on final pas-
sage. It was simply a vote to limit fur-
ther debate, after which there would 
have been 30 more hours to continue to 
negotiate if they wanted to drag this 
out endlessly. After that, of course, the 
futures market tanked in anticipation 
of an ugly tomorrow based upon an ab-
sence of the bipartisan agreement we 
have been seeking. 
They voted to block, specifically, 
surge resources for hospitals, a massive 
expansion in unemployment benefits, 
historic relief for small businesses to 
prevent mass layoffs, direct checks for 
millions of Americans, and expanding 
healthcare 
workers’ 
access 
to 
the 
masks that they need. Even if Demo-
crats reverse course tomorrow—tomor-
row—the vote they cast today will al-
most certainly cause more Americans 
to lose their jobs and more seniors’

hard-earned retirement savings to lit-
erally evaporate. 
Our Nation cannot afford the game of 
chicken. We can’t afford the cynical 
partisanship that one senior House 
Democrat owned up to just the other 
day. Here is what he said: ‘‘This is a 
tremendous opportunity to restructure 
things to fit our vision.’’ 
It is an unconscionable statement to 
view this as a partisan opportunity. 
This is a national emergency, not a 
partisan opportunity. Doctors, nurses, 
small 
business 
employees, 
laid-off 
Americans, and vulnerable seniors need 
our help right now. 
So here is the way ahead, colleagues. 
We are going to vote at 9:45 in the 
morning—the same vote we had at 6 
o’clock tonight. We are going to vote 
at 9:45 in the morning, 15 minutes after 
the markets open, and see whether 
there is a change of heart. That vote 
will occur, unless we can finally reach 
an agreement sometime between now 
and then. I just want all of our col-
leagues to know when our next vote 
will be in the absence of an agree-
ment—9:45 in the morning, 15 minutes 
after the markets open. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it 
adjourn until 9 a.m., Monday, March 
23; further, that following the prayer 
and pledge, the morning hour be 
deemed expired, the Journal of pro-
ceedings be approved to date, the time 
for the two leaders be reserved for their 
use later in the day, and morning busi-
ness be closed; further, that following 
leader remarks, the Senate resume 
consideration of the motion to proceed 
to H.R. 748. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, I know the majority leader likes 
to talk about partisanship, but we are 
not here for that reason. The bill we 
are voting on will affect us not just in 
the days to come but in the months 
and years to come, and we need the 
best bill possible. 
We Democrats have seen some real 
flaws in the bill that was put on the 
floor by the Republicans. What it has 
is, for instance, a giant, giant cor-
porate bailout fund with no account-
ability. You wouldn’t even know if the 
loans were made until 6 months later. 
What we have seen is a cutback in 
what we asked for, for hospitals, doc-
tors, and nurses—masks, equipment. 
We need more money than what the 
Republican 
majority 
has 
proposed. 
What we have seen is no money for 
State and local governments. They are 
going broke. They have huge, huge, 
new expenses. We need to make those 
better. 
The bottom line is very simple. We 
are fighting for a better bill because 
this bill will have an effect for a very, 
very long time. 
I have been working with Secretary 
Mnuchin and the President’s congres-
sional liaison, Eric. They have been in 
my office about six times tonight. We 
are making progress, and I think there 
is a good chance we will have an agree-
ment, but we don’t need artificial dead-
lines. We will get this done. We will 
come in at 12 noon, and, hopefully, we 
will have an agreement by then. 
So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
as I have said repeatedly and as, I 
think, all 100 of us know, we had a good 
bipartisan bill that was developed on a 
bipartisan basis with Members in the 
Senate, over the last 48 hours, until the 
Democratic leader and the Speaker of 
the House decided to blow it all up and 
play Russian roulette with the mar-
kets. The futures market is dramati-
cally down, going into tomorrow. The 
Asian markets, I suspect—I haven’t 
checked—are probably rattled by all of 
this. 
Nothing would have been lost by al-
lowing us to get on the bill because 
they could have used 30 more hours— 
not that they should have but they 
could have used 30 more hours—to con-
tinue to negotiate. But, alas, every sin-
gle one of them has been on record as 
preventing us from taking the next 
step toward getting the agreement the 
American people are waiting and wait-
ing and waiting for us to get. 
The result of what the Democratic 
leader just did was to prevent us from 
voting right after the markets open in 
the morning and will allow the mar-
kets to be rattled until 12 noon, further 
evidence of the reckless behavior we 
have witnessed on the Democratic side 
in the Senate over the last hours. 
ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 23, 2020 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it 
adjourn until 12 noon, Monday, March 
23; further, that following the prayer 
and pledge, the morning hour be 
deemed expired, the Journal of pro-
ceedings be approved to date, the time 
for the two leaders be reserved for their 
use later in the day, and morning busi-
ness be closed; further, that following 
leader remarks, the Senate resume 
consideration of the motion to proceed 
to H.R. 748. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAGNOSTIC 
TESTING SERVICES UNDER MEDI-
CARE AND MEDICAID. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Allergies, when not properly diagnosed, 
cannot be effectively treated. 
(2) Allergies to food, inhaled particles, or 
other sources can cause debilitating and, in 
some cases, fatal reactions. 
(3) Allergies can substantially compound 
other illnesses, including asthma, emphy-
sema, and adult obstructive pulmonary dis-
eases, leading to social and economic costs 
for families and our Nation’s health care sys-
tem. 
(4) According to clinical guidelines from 
the National Institutes of Health and rec-
ommendations 
from 
peer-reviewed 
lit-
erature, in vitro specific IgE tests and 
percutaneous tests are considered equivalent 
as confirmatory tests in terms of their sensi-
tivity and accuracy. 
(5) Despite these recommendations, some 
current Medicare local coverage determina-
tions and Medicaid coverage policies deny 
equal access to in vitro specific IgE tests and 
percutaneous tests. 
(6) 
In 
vitro 
specific 
IgE 
tests 
and 
percutaneous tests must be equally acces-
sible for clinicians and patients to improve 
health outcomes, reduce system costs, and 
reduce current health care disparities caused 
by the lack of equal coverage. 
(b) MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAG-
NOSTIC TESTING SERVICES.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Title XIX of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is 
amended— 
(A) in section 1902(a)— 
(i) in paragraph (85), by striking ‘‘and’’ at 
the end; 
(ii) in paragraph (86), by striking the pe-
riod at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and 
(iii) by inserting after paragraph (86) the 
following new paragraph: 
‘‘(87) provide, with respect to the provision 
of allergy diagnostic testing services (as de-
fined in section 1905(gg)) under the State 
plan, for equality in the treatment of in 
vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous 
tests with respect to— 
‘‘(A) any medical necessity or other cov-
erage requirements established for such in 
vitro specific IgE and percutaneous tests; 
‘‘(B) any frequency limits established for 
such tests; and 
‘‘(C) any allergen unit limits established 
for such tests.’’; and 
(B) in section 1905— 
(i) in subsection (r)— 
(I) by redesignating paragraph (5) as para-
graph (6); and 
(II) by inserting after paragraph (4) the fol-
lowing new paragraph: 
‘‘(5) Allergy diagnostic testing services (as 
defined in subsection (gg)).’’; and 
(ii) by adding at the end the following new 
subsection: 
‘‘(gg) ALLERGY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SERV-
ICES DEFINED.—The term ‘allergy diagnostic 
testing services’ means in vitro specific IgE 
tests and percutaneous tests that— 
‘‘(1) have been cleared under section 501(k), 
classified under section 513(f)(2), or approved 
under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act; and 
‘‘(2) are provided to individuals for the pur-
pose of evaluating immunologic response to 
certain antigens.’’. 
(2) EFFECTIVE DATE.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), the amendments made by this sub-
section shall apply with respect to items and 
services provided on or after January 1, 2021. 
(B) EXCEPTION FOR STATE LEGISLATION.—In 
the case of a State plan under title XIX of 
the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et 
seq.) that the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services determines requires State 
legislation in order for the respective plan to 
meet any requirement imposed by amend-
ments made by this subsection, the respec-
tive plan shall not be regarded as failing to 
comply with the requirements of such title 
solely on the basis of its failure to meet such 
an additional requirement before the first 
day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
after the close of the first regular session of 
the State legislature that begins after the 
date of the enactment of this subsection. For 
purposes of the previous sentence, in the 
case of a State that has a 2-year legislative 
session, each year of the session shall be con-
sidered to be a separate regular session of 
the State legislature. 
(c) MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR ALLERGY DIAG-
NOSTIC TESTING SERVICES.— 
(1) COVERAGE.—Section 1861 of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x) is amended—

at the end; 
(ii) in subparagraph (HH), by striking the 
period at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and
