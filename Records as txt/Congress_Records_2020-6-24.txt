stone of 200 judicial confirmations 
since President Trump came to the 
Presidency in 2017. These have been 
nominees in the molds of Justice 
Scalia, just as the President promised 
nearly 4 years ago. They will strictly 
interpret the Constitution and Federal 
statutes. Their decisions will be driven 
by what the law actually says, not 
their own personal policy preferences. 
This landmark achievement is the re-
sult of the President keeping his word 
and the unwavering determination of 
Leader MCCONNELL, Chairman GRAHAM, 
and the Republican conference. 
In the hands of these many strict 
constructionist judges, the future of 
American jurisprudence is very, very 
bright. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
in a few hours, the Senate will confirm 
Judge Cory T. Wilson to join the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
Yet again, President Trump has sent 
up an outstanding nominee for this im-
portant vacancy. Judge Wilson holds 
degrees from the University of Mis-
sissippi and Yale Law School. He has 
held a prestigious clerkship, found suc-
cess in private practice, and spent 
years in public service as a lawyer and 
a judge. The American Bar Association 
rates Mr. Wilson ‘‘well qualified.’’ 
Once we confirm Judge Wilson today, 
the Senate will have confirmed 200— 
200—of President Trump’s nominees to 
lifetime appointments on the Federal 
bench. Following No. 200, when we de-
part this Chamber today, there will not 
be a single circuit court vacancy any-
where in the Nation for the first time 
in at least 40 years. There will not be a 
single circuit court vacancy anywhere 
in the Nation for the first time in at 
least 40 years. 
As I have said many times, our work 
with the administration to renew our 
Federal courts is not a partisan or po-
litical victory; it is a victory for the 
rule of law and for the Constitution 
itself. 
If judges applying the law and the 
Constitution 
as 
they 
are 
written 
strikes any of our colleagues as a 
threat to their political agenda, then 
the problem, I would argue, is with 
their agenda. 
f 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, today was supposed 
to bring progress for an issue that is 
weighing heavily on the minds of 
Americans. In the wake of the killings 
of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, 
following weeks of passionate protests 
from coast to coast, the Senate was 
supposed to officially take up police re-
form on the floor today. Instead, our 
Democratic colleagues are poised to 
turn this routine step into a partisan 
impasse. 
Frankly, to most Americans, the sit-
uation would sound like a satire of 
what goes on in the Senate: a heated 
argument over whether to invoke clo-
ture on a motion to proceed to a pro-
posal—a heated argument over whether 
to invoke cloture on a motion to pro-
ceed to a proposal. We are literally ar-
guing about whether to stop arguing 
about whether to start arguing about 
something else. 
I can stand here for an hour and extol 
the virtues of Senator TIM
SCOTT’s 
JUSTICE Act. His legislation has al-
ready earned 48 cosponsors because it 
is a straightforward plan based on 
facts, based on data, and based on lived 
experience. It focuses on improving ac-
countability and restoring trust. It ad-
dresses key issues like choke holds and 
no-knock warrants. It expands report-
ing, transparency in hiring, and train-
ing for deescalation. 
I am proud to stand with this legisla-
tion, but the reality is that nobody 
thought the first offer from the Repub-
lican side was going to be the final 
product that traveled out of the Sen-
ate. What is supposed to happen in this

S3162 
June 24, 2020 
body is that we vote or agree to get 
onto a bill, and then we discuss, de-
bate, and amend it until at least 60 
Senators are satisfied, or it goes no-
where. It goes nowhere at the end until 
60 Senators are satisfied. 
So what are they giving up? Nothing. 
They don’t want an outcome. The vote 
we will take in a few hours is just the 
first step. We aren’t passing a bill. We 
aren’t making policy decisions. It is 
just a procedural vote to say that po-
lice reform is the subject the Senate 
will tackle next. That is all it says— 
that police reform is the subject the 
Senate will tackle next. 
Alas, our Democratic colleagues have 
suddenly begun to signal they are not 
willing to even begin the discussion on 
police reform. They are threatening to 
block the subject from even reaching 
the Senate floor. 
Yesterday, in a letter to me and on 
the floor, the Democratic leader and 
the junior Senators from New Jersey 
and California put forward an argu-
ment that was almost nonsensical. 
First, they explained a number of pol-
icy differences they have with Senator 
SCOTT’s proposal. No problem there. 
The Senate has a handy tool for set-
tling such differences; it is called legis-
lating. We take up bills. We debate 
them. We consider amendments from 
both sides. And only if and when 60 
Senators are satisfied can we even vote 
on passage. 
But this time, Senate Democrats say 
the legislative process should not hap-
pen. This time, the Democratic leader 
is saying he will not let the Senate 
take up the subject of police reform at 
all—at all—unless I pre-negotiate with 
him in private and rewrite our starting 
point until he is satisfied. 
This last-minute ultimatum is par-
ticularly ironic given the weeks of 
rhetoric from leading Democrats about 
how very urgent—how very urgent—it 
was that Congress address police re-
form and racial justice. For weeks, the 
Democratic leader has blustered that 
the Senate simply had to address this 
issue before July 4. Well, that is what 
the vote this morning is about. 
Last week, Speaker PELOSI said: ‘‘I 
hope there’s a compromise to be 
reached in the Congress. . . .’’ because 
‘‘How many more people have to die 
from police brutality?’’ So, as recently 
as last week, leading Democrats called 
it a life-or-death issue for the Senate 
to take up the subject this month. 
Well, here we are. Here we are. We are 
ready to address it. But now, in the 
last 48 hours, this bizarre, new ulti-
matum. Now they don’t want to take 
up the issue. They don’t want to de-
bate. They don’t want amendments. 
They will filibuster police reform from 
even reaching the floor of the Senate 
unless the majority lets the minority 
rewrite the bill behind closed doors in 
advance. Let me say that again. They 
will filibuster police reform from even 
reaching the floor unless the majority 
lets the minority rewrite the bill be-
hind closed doors in advance. 
Yesterday, the Speaker of the House 
told CBS News that because Senate Re-
publicans 
do 
support 
Senator 
TIM 
SCOTT’s reform bill, we are all—listen 
to this jaw-dropping comment—‘‘trying 
to get away with murder . . . the mur-
der of George Floyd.’’ That is the 
Speaker of the House accusing Senate 
Republicans of trying to get away with 
murder. 
Are you beginning to see how this 
game works? Two weeks ago, it was 
implied the Senate would have blood 
on our hands if we didn’t take up police 
reform. Now Democrats say Senator 
SCOTT and 48 other Senators have blood 
on our hands because we are trying to 
take up police reform. 
What fascinating times we live in. 
Armies of elites and Twitter mobs 
stand ready to pounce on any speech 
they deem problematic. Yet unhinged 
comments like these get a complete 
free pass—a complete free pass. 
When our country needs unity, they 
are trying to keep us apart. When our 
Nation needs bipartisan solutions, they 
are staging partisan theater. This is 
political nonsense elevated to an art 
form. 
In a body that has amendments and 
substitute amendments, it is nonsense 
to say a police reform bill cannot be 
the starting point for a police reform 
bill. It is nonsense for Democrats to 
say that, because they want to change 
Senator SCOTT’s bill, they are going to 
block the Senate from taking it up and 
amending it. If they are confident in 
their positions, they should embrace 
the amendment process. If they aren’t 
confident their views will persuade oth-
ers, that just underscores why they 
don’t get to insert these views in ad-
vance—in 
advance—behind 
closed 
doors. 
No final legislation can pass without 
60 votes. If Democrats do not like the 
final product, it will not pass. The only 
way there is any downside for Demo-
crats to come to the table is that they 
would rather preserve this urgent sub-
ject as a live campaign issue than pass 
a bipartisan answer. 
The majority has done everything we 
can to proceed to this issue in good 
faith. I have fast-tracked this issue to 
the floor this month, as our Demo-
cratic colleagues said they wanted 
until 48 hours ago. I have expressed my 
support for a robust amendment proc-
ess, as our Democratic colleagues said 
they wanted until 48 hours ago. 
So make no mistake about it: Senate 
Republicans are ready to make a law. 
We are ready to discuss and amend our 
way to a bipartisan product, pass it, 
and take it to conference with the 
House. The American people deserve an 
outcome, and we cannot get an out-
come if Democrats will not even let us 
begin—not even let us begin. 
I hope our colleagues reconsider and 
let the Senate consider police reform 
later today. If they do not, the next 
time another appalling incident makes 
our Nation sick to its stomach with 
grief and anger yet again, Senate 
Democrats can explain to the Nation 
why they made sure the Senate did 
nothing.

JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the names of George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery continue 
to ring in the Nation’s ears, a searing 
reminder of the desperate need to re-
form policing and truly address injus-
tice in America. Their memory is a na-
tional call to action. 
Democrats answered that call by pro-
posing a broad, strong, comprehensive 
policing reform bill that would bring 
deep and lasting change to police de-
partments 
across 
America. 
House 
Democrats will pass that bill, the Jus-
tice in Policing Act, as early as tomor-
row. 
However, here in the Senate, the Re-
publican majority proposed the legisla-
tive equivalent of a fig leaf, something 
that provides a little cover but no real 
change. In less than an hour, Leader 
MCCONNELL will ask the Senate to pro-
ceed to the so-called policing reform 
bill. 
We have all gone over the bill’s defi-
ciencies over and over. There are no 
good answers. Some on the other side 
have said the bills are similar. They 
are like night and day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3163 
June 24, 2020 
In response to the brutal killing of 
George Floyd—his wind pipe crushed 
by a police officer—my Republican 
friends drafted a bill that does not even 
fully ban the type of brutal tactics 
that led to his death. 
In response to the death of Breonna 
Taylor, killed by police executing a no- 
knock warrant, my Republican friends 
have drafted a bill that doesn’t even 
ban that type of tactic—what weak 
tea. For Leader MCCONNELL to come on 
the floor with this bill and say he is 
solving the problem—no one believes 
that, except maybe a few ideologues 
who really don’t want to solve the 
problem to begin with. 
The bill doesn’t ban choke holds. It 
doesn’t back no-knock warrants. It 
does nothing to stop profiling, the mili-
tarization of police or reform, use of 
force standards, and qualified immu-
nity—all of the things that need to be 
done, almost none of which are in this 
bill. 
The last piece is particularly sur-
prising. So much of the anger in the 
country right now is directed at the 
lack of accountability for police offi-
cers who violate Americans’ rights. As 
far as I can tell, the Republican bill 
does not even attempt one significant 
reform—not one—to bring more ac-
countability to police officers who are 
guilty of misconduct. 
If you present a bill, as Republicans 
have here in the Senate, that does 
nothing on accountability and say they 
are solving or dealing with the problem 
in even close to an adequate way, they 
are sadly mistaken. No one—no one— 
believes that. 
I could spend more time in describing 
what the Republican bill doesn’t do 
than what it does do. The harsh fact of 
the matter is the bill is so deeply, fun-
damentally, and irrevocably flawed, it 
cannot serve as a useful starting point 
for real reform. 
Don’t ask me. Don’t ask the Demo-
crats here. Ask the leading civil rights 
organizations, 
which 
have 
declared 
their strong opposition not only to this 
bill but have urged us not to move for-
ward because they know this bill is a 
sham, a cul-de-sac, which will lead to 
no reform whatsoever. 
Yesterday, 138 civil rights groups 
sent an open letter to Senators de-
manding that we vote no on moving to 
proceed today. I have the letter here. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
the full letter. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON 
CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS, 
June 23, 2020. 
VOTE NO ON THE MOTION TO PROCEED—S. 3985 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
DEAR SENATORS: On behalf of The Leader-
ship Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
(The Leadership Conference), a coalition 
charged by its diverse membership of more 
than 220 national organizations to promote 
and protect civil and human rights in the 
United States, and the undersigned 138 orga-
nizations, we write to express our strong op-
position to S. 3985, the Just and Unifying So-
lutions to Invigorate Communities Every-
where (JUSTICE) Act. The JUSTICE Act is 
an inadequate response to the decades of 
pain, hardship, and devastation that Black 
people have and continue to endure as a re-
sult of systemic racism and lax policies that 
fail to hold police accountable for mis-
conduct. This bill falls woefully short of the 
comprehensive reform needed to address the 
current policing crisis and achieve meaning-
ful law enforcement accountability. It is 
deeply problematic to meet this moment 
with a menial incremental approach that of-
fers more funding to police, and few policies 
to effectively address the constant loss of 
Black lives at the hands of police. We there-
fore urge you to oppose the JUSTICE Act 
and vote no on the motion to proceed when 
this legislation is brought to the floor. The 
Leadership Conference will score this vote in 
our voting record for the 116th Congress. 
Abusive policing practices, coupled with 
devastating state-sanctioned violence, have 
exacted systemic brutality and fatality upon 
Black people since our nation’s founding. Po-
lice have shot and killed more than 1,000 peo-
ple in the United States over the past year, 
and Black people are disproportionately 
more likely than white people to be killed by 
police. The chronic structural issue of police 
killings and lawlessness against Black peo-
ple have escalated to a boiling point in re-
cent weeks following the deaths of individ-
uals like Breonna Taylor, Dreasjon ‘‘Sean’’ 
Reed, George Floyd, Tony McDade, and oth-
ers. The current protests in our cities are a 
response not only to the unjust policing of 
Black people, but also a call for action to 
public officials to enact bold, comprehensive, 
and structural change. 
That is why, on June 1, 2020, The Leader-
ship Conference sent Congress a letter out-
lining accountability principles that must be 
adopted as a baseline to address rampant, 
systemic, white supremacy in law enforce-
ment across America. In less than 12 hours, 
more than 450 of this country’s most diverse 
civil rights, civil liberties, and racial justice 
organizations signed onto that letter because 
what was asked of Congress aligned with 
what advocates, policing experts, and other 
stakeholders agree is needed. The priorities 
highlighted are not only reasonable but re-
flect a bare minimum of what must be in-
cluded in any policing legislation Congress 
adopts in order for systemic reform to occur. 
These priorities are: (1) the creation of a 
use of force standard that allows force only 
when necessary and as a last resort; (2) a ban 
on chokeholds; (3) a ban on racial profiling; 
(4) the establishment of a police misconduct 
registry; (5) the inclusion of a ‘‘reckless’’ 
standard in 18 U.S.C. Section 242 that en-
ables federal prosecutors to hold law enforce-
ment accountable for criminal civil rights 
violations; (6) a prohibition on no-knock 
warrants, especially in drug cases; (7) the 
elimination of the judge-made doctrine of 
qualified immunity, which allows officers 
and other government actors to evade ac-
countability when they violate individuals’ 
rights; and (8) the demilitarization of law en-
forcement 
agencies. 
This 
accountability 
framework is reflected in S. 3912, the Justice 
in Policing Act of 2020. 
Unfortunately, Senate majority leadership 
ignored these critical policies and introduced 
the JUSTICE Act, a bill that fails to align 
with our framework principles and will 
therefore not bring about the fundamental 
shift in policing our country needs. The bill 
does nothing to address current barriers to 
holding law enforcement accountable, such 
as abolishing qualified immunity or crim-
inalizing the reckless use of force. It does 
not address, let alone prohibit, the perverse 
yet pervasive practice of racial profiling, nor 
does it include explicit bans on dangerous 
practices like chokeholds or no-knock war-
rants. It fails to address the militarization of 
police or the need for a national standard re-
stricting the use of force, and lacks the na-
tional, robust, and publicly available mis-
conduct registry required for true trans-
parency. 
Further, the JUSTICE Act provides more 
than $7 billion of additional federal dollars 
for law enforcement over the next five years, 
directly contradicting our coalition’s call 
and that of those marching in the streets to 
redefine public safety by reducing the foot-
print of our criminal legal system. Many of 
the crises that currently involve police re-
sponses, and which too often lead to mis-
treatment and increased mistrust, would be 
better handled through the addition of 
health providers, social workers, and others 
who can meet the needs of communities in a 
non-punitive manner. Pouring additional 
funding into a broken system is bad policy. 
Furthermore, considering the limited finan-
cial resources prompted by the COVID–19 
pandemic, all policing reform models must 
reprioritize how limited dollars are spent. 
The programs authorized by the JUSTICE 
Act will necessarily mean fewer funds to 
tackle other issues critical to longlasting 
safety, such as housing, education, and 
health care. Millions of people in the United 
States are calling for these kinds of direct 
investments into communities, and Congress 
should heed that call. 
Now is the time for Congress to be bold and 
pass meaningful police accountability re-
form legislation. A vast and diverse collec-
tion of people from coast to coast are calling 
on lawmakers to prioritize Black commu-
nities and protect them from the systemic 
perils of over-policing, police brutality, mis-
conduct, and harassment. It is your moral 
and ethical duty to ensure Black people and 
communities are free from the harm and 
threats from law enforcement and milita-
rized police responses. It is also your respon-
sibility to ensure that any legislation passed 
does not just provide lip service to these 
problems, but fully meets the critical needs 
of this moment and beyond. Passing wa-
tered-down legislation that fails to remedy 
the actual harms resulting in the loss of life 
is a moral statement that is inconsistent 
with a genuine belief that black lives mat-
ter. Anything less than full support for com-
prehensive legislation that holds police ac-
countable is inexcusable. Further, any at-
tempt to amend or salvage the JUSTICE Act 
will only serve to ‘‘check the box’’ and claim 
reform when, in actuality, no reform has oc-
curred to combat police misconduct and to 
protect Black lives. For these reasons, we 
urge you to oppose the JUSTICE Act and 
vote no on the motion to proceed on this leg-
islation. 
Thank you for your leadership in advanc-
ing these important policy recommenda-
tions. If you have any questions about the 
issues raised in this letter, please contact

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
want to ask the American people, I 
want to ask Republican Senators: Who 
is a better guardian of the civil rights 
of African Americans when it comes to 
police reform—the NAACP or MITCH 
MCCONNELL? 
If this bill were such a good path to 
reform, why wouldn’t civil rights orga-
nizations from one end of America to 
another say: Go forward; maybe we will 
get something done. Because they 
know the bill is a ruse, and nothing 
will get done. That is the way it is de-
signed. Whom do you believe when it 
comes to civil rights and police ac-
countability—MITCH MCCONNELL or the 
lawyer for the families of George Floyd 
and Breonna Taylor? Whom do you be-
lieve—the lawyer of the Floyd and Tay-
lor families or MITCH
MCCONNELL, 
whom we have never heard speak on 
this issue on the floor until the last 
few weeks? These groups have been 
speaking about it for decades. 
The idea—the idea—that this bill is a 
step forward when it will lead to no-
where? It will not be. MITCH MCCON-
NELL keeps saying you can cut the bill 
off when you don’t get your 60 votes. 
What kind of solution is that, when it 
is a junky bill, when it is a bill that 
doesn’t go far enough at all? Why don’t 
we put a good bill on the floor that can 
pass? 
Let me read what the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
said. They have had a hand in crafting 
every piece of meaningful legislation 
passed in Congress in the last few 
years. 
The JUSTICE Act— 
The Republican bill— 
is an inadequate response to the decades of 
pain, hardship, and devastation that Black 
people have and continue to endure as a re-
sult of systemic racism and lax policies that 
fail to hold police accountable for mis-
conduct. This bill falls woefully short of the 
comprehensive reform needed to address the 
current policing crisis and achieve meaning-
ful law enforcement accountability. 
Listen to this sentence, from 136 civil 
rights organizations about this bill 
that Leader MCCONNELL has put on the 
floor: 
It is deeply problematic to meet this mo-
ment with a menial incremental approach 
that offers more funding to police, and few 
policies to effectively address the constant 
loss of Black lives at the hands of police. 
Leader MCCONNELL, here is what the 
civil rights organizations say about 
your bill. They rip off any cloaking 
about what this bill really does and 
what it is. I want to read it again—spe-
cifically to our Republican leader, who 
thinks this is a good bill and a great 
attempt to go forward: 
It is deeply problematic to meet this mo-
ment with a menial incremental approach 
that offers more funding to police, and few 
policies to effectively address the constant 
loss of Black lives at the hands of police. 
Whom do you believe, America—the 
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights 
or MITCH MCCONNELL? Whom do you 
believe, America—the NAACP or the 
Republican caucus? Whom do you be-
lieve, America—the lawyer for the Tay-
lor and Floyd families or Donald 
Trump, who has these Members quak-
ing in their boots if they do something 
that he doesn’t like? 
That is one of the other reasons we 
are in such a pickle here. They are so 
afraid of Donald Trump, who is willing 
to say overtly racist statements, like 
‘‘Kung Flu’’ several times yesterday, 
that they can’t even bring themselves 
to put a bill on the floor that has a 
modicum of respect from the civil 
rights community? When you call it 
‘‘menial,’’ you are not respecting a bill. 
The NAACP Legal Defense and Edu-
cational Fund, founded by the great 
Justice Thurgood Marshall—here is 
what it said. They have been fighting 
for these things for 80 on years, not 8 
days. ‘‘It cannot support legislation 
that does not embody a strong ac-
countability framework for police offi-
cers and [other] law enforcement who 
engage in misconduct.’’ 
Here is what Benjamin Crump, the 
lawyer, said: The Republican legisla-
tion is ‘‘in direct contrast to the de-
mands of the people’’ who have been 
protesting; and ‘‘the Black Community 
is tired of lip service, and shocked that 
the [Republican proposal] can [even] be 
thought of as legislation.’’ That is the 
lawyer for the Taylor and Floyd fami-
lies. Leader MCCONNELL has invoked 
their names—that is the right thing to 
do—but then deviates totally from 
what their lawyer says needs to be 
done to deal with these kinds of deaths. 
Again, Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for 
the Floyd and Taylor families: ‘‘The 
Black community is tired of the lip 
service, and shocked that the [Repub-
lican proposal] can [even] be thought of 
as legislation.’’ 
Don’t get on your sanctimonious 
horse, Leader MCCONNELL. You have 
none of the civil rights community be-
hind you. 
The most preeminent civil rights 
groups in our Nation’s history are 
speaking. The lawyer representing the 
families of Americans who have lost 
their loved ones at the hands of those 
who are sworn to protect and serve are 
speaking. They have one simple, urgent 
goal, and it has nothing to do with pol-
itics. 
Leader MCCONNELL accuses what we 
are doing as being filled with politics. 
Does Leader MCCONNELL accuse all 138 
civil rights organizations of wanting to 
do this for politics? No, no, no. I think 
the shoe is on the other foot. I think 
the politics here is that Leader MCCON-
NELL wants to show that he is doing 
something and get nothing done. 
He may be afraid of President Trump. 
He may be afraid of some police organi-
zations. I don’t know what it is. 
Here is what they say in their letter: 
‘‘We therefore urge you’’—the Sen-
ators—‘‘to oppose the JUSTICE Act 
and vote no on the motion to proceed.’’ 
I dare the leader to come out here 
and say they are playing politics—

S3165 
June 24, 2020 
come right out and say it—because it is 
false, and we, the Democrats, are 
aligned with what they believe. 
This morning, we heard more predict-
able histrionics from the Republican 
leader—the accusation of mindless ob-
struction and outrageous hypocrisy. 
Leader MCCONNELL should spare us the 
lectures about how laws get made. He 
knows how. It is through bipartisan-
ship. The leader talks about bipartisan-
ship and introduces a totally partisan 
bill and introduces a process where 
Democrats have had no input. That is 
partisanship. 
Do you want to be bipartisan, Leader 
MCCONNELL? Sit down, assemble a 
group—some from your side, maybe 
Senator SCOTT, who is greatly re-
spected; some from our side, maybe 
Senators BOOKER and HARRIS, who are 
greatly respected; and a few others. Let 
them sit down and come up with a pro-
posal. It does not have to be behind 
closed doors. 
The leader is worried about closed 
doors? There is something called the 
Judiciary Committee. It doesn’t meet 
in secret. Why wasn’t this bill referred 
there, where there would be at least 
something of a bipartisan process? Who 
is he kidding? Who is he kidding? 
You don’t want closed doors, Leader 
MCCONNELL? Send it to the Judiciary 
Committee. Something as important as 
this should have gone through that to 
begin with. 
Let me repeat: Republicans came 
here, dropped the bill on the floor, and 
said: Take it or leave it. Even if we 
were to get on the bill, there is no con-
ceivable way to rectify all of its many 
problems. It is not realistic that we 
can fix this bill even with a series of 
amendments because they will require 
60 votes, and we will not get 60 on any 
of them. If they believed in these ideas, 
as Senator HARRIS said, they would 
have put them in the bill to begin with. 
They didn’t. 
The Republican majority has given 
the Senate a bad bill and no credible 
way to sufficiently improve it. Senator 
MCCONNELL—cleverly, 
maybe 
cyni-
cally—designed a legislative cul-de-sac 
from which no bill—no bill at all— 
could emerge. And whether the bill 
lacks 60 votes now or 60 votes in a few 
days, we know the Republican leader 
will accuse Democrats of filibustering 
and claiming we are the opponents of 
progress, as he did this morning. 
Please, does anyone believe that 
Democrats are the obstacles to reform-
ing our police departments? Does any-
one believe that? We announced a 
much bolder, stronger, better, more ef-
fective bill 3 weeks ago. And, unlike 
the Republican legislation, the Justice 
in Policing Act will actually pass a 
Chamber of Congress. When it passes 
the House, the Nation is going to say 
to Leader MCCONNELL: Get something 
moving in the Senate. And Leader 
MCCONNELL
knows, and everyone in 
this body knows, that you have to do 
that in a bipartisan way. That is how 
the Senate has always worked and still 
does. 
Senate Republicans and their Presi-
dent, who proclaims we should cherish 
the memory of Confederate traitors 
who fought to preserve slavery, who 
gleefully called the coronavirus ‘‘Kung 
Flu,’’ with hardly a word of criticism 
from his party, expects you to believe 
that Republicans are, all of a sudden, 
the true champions of racial justice 
and police reform? That is what Senate 
Republicans want America to believe, 
and America ain’t buying it. 
The same Republican majority that 
has demonstrated a complete lack of 
urgency to address the public health 
and economic crises that are dev-
astating Black America, the same Re-
publican majority that has refused 
time and again to call out President 
Trump’s bigotry and intolerance, the 
same Republican majority that has run 
a conveyor belt of anti-civil rights 
votes for judicial nominees, including 
one today—today, the very same day 
we vote on policing reform—wants you 
to believe that all of a sudden they 
want to get something done. As they 
say in Brooklyn, forget about it. 
When you hear President Trump and 
Senator MCCONNELL
trying to cast 
blame for lack of progress on police re-
form, I have three words for you: Con-
sider the source. Look at their history. 
Look at what they have done. Look at 
just today. Leader MCCONNELL proudly 
brags that he is putting someone on 
the Fifth Circuit who has opposed vot-
ing rights for his whole career. That is 
who wants to move things forward? I 
doubt it. 
Here is the truth. Senator MCCON-
NELL has been around a long time and 
knows how to produce a workable out-
come in the Senate if he really wants 
to. We have done it before on criminal 
justice reform, on annual budgets, on 
the national defense bill, and on the 
lands package we just passed. 
Even on difficult issues like immi-
gration, the Senate can function if the 
leadership allows it to. In 2013, a bipar-
tisan group of Senators produced com-
promise immigration legislation that 
garnered two-thirds of this Chamber on 
immigration, no less. What do bills 
that pass have in common? Bipartisan-
ship, sponsorship, and support. What 
does this bill have? Only partisan sup-
port. Not a single Democrat supports 
this bill, their bill. 
While I certainly feel obligated to 
point out the contradictions and hy-
pocrisy in the Republican leader’s 
statements and history, I am not dis-
mayed by the likely failure of the Re-
publican bill today. All is not lost. 
There is a better path and one we 
should take once this bill fails to go 
forward. 
After this bill goes down, there 
should be bipartisan discussions with 
the object of coming together around a 
constructive starting point for police 
reform. Leader MCCONNELL can pick a 
few of his Members as negotiators. I 
could designate a few from our caucus. 
They can sit down, talk to one another, 
and find a bill that we are ready to 
start debating. We could send that bill 
to the committee and have an open 
process, as it would be refined. This is 
an important issue. 
That, Leader MCCONNELL, is what 
successful legislating will be. I have no 
doubt that we could come up with a 
bill that is ready for the floor in a few 
weeks. We know how to do this. But in 
the rush to get this issue off their 
backs, to check some political box and 
move on, my Republican colleagues 
have forgotten or are simply ignoring 
everything they know about how the 
Senate works. 
My hope, my prayer is that after this 
bill fails today, after Leader MCCON-
NELL’s path reaches its preordained 
dead end, we can start down the path of 
bipartisanship—real 
bipartisanship— 
not a bill designed to be put on the 
floor by one party. 
If Americans of all ages and colors 
and of all faiths can join together in a 
righteous chorus calling for change, as 
they have in big cities and small towns 
across America, then we in the Senate 
can at least try to come together to de-
liver it—Democrats and Republicans 
working together to solve an age-old 
problem that is a deep wound in Amer-
ica. 
These past few weeks have magnified 
a very old wound in our country. The 
binding up of that wound is a project 
that demands more from all of us: 
Black Americans, White Americans, 
police departments, and the protesters 
in the streets—Democrats and Repub-
licans. 
So, please, let us not once again re-
treat to our partisan corners after to-
day’s vote. Let us appeal, instead, to 
the better angels of our nature, reach 
out to one another, Democrats and Re-
publicans, and try to forge a path for-
ward together. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The majority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in 
just a few minutes, we will vote on 
whether to move forward on Senator 
SCOTT’s policing reform bill. 
We are at a turning point in our Na-
tion’s history—a moment when Ameri-
cans of every background and political 
persuasion are united in a call for 
change. We have a chance to give it to 
them. Over the course of the next cou-
ple of weeks, we will have a chance to 
pass legislation that will permanently 
reform policing in this country—legis-
lation that will improve training, in-
crease accountability, and give in-
creased security to families who worry 
that their sons or daughters could be 
the next George Floyd or Breonna Tay-
lor. Senator SCOTT’s legislation, the 
Just and Unifying Solutions to Invig-
orate Communities Everywhere Act, or 
the JUSTICE Act, is a product of years 
of serious work. It is an extensive bill 
that focuses on a number of areas that 
call for reform. 
Make no mistake about it. When the 
Democrats vote today, if they do—and, 
I hope, there will be enough of them

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3166 
June 24, 2020 
who will not, so as to allow this legis-
lation to move forward—they will be 
voting to block police reform legisla-
tion, because that is what this is. This 
is not Senator MCCONNELL’s bill. The 
Democratic leader kept attacking Sen-
ator MCCONNELL
and the McConnell 
legislation. This is a TIM SCOTT bill, 
crafted with input from other Sen-
ators, with input from communities of 
color from across this country, and 
with input from the law enforcement 
community—people who care deeply 
about not just talking about this issue 
but about actually solving this issue, 
people who care about action. The 
Democratic objection and vote to block 
this legislation from moving forward 
will prevent an open debate in front of 
the entire American public about an 
issue that has generated a tremendous 
amount of controversy, not only cur-
rently but throughout our Nation’s his-
tory. 
We cannot change our past—there 
are parts of it that we are not proud 
of—but we can change our future, and 
that could start today with this vote to 
get on this bill and then to have an 
open process. 
The leader has promised that, if we 
can get on this bill, we will have an 
amendment process. If there are things 
in the bill that people on either side of 
the aisle think can be improved on, 
they will have an opportunity to offer 
amendments to make those improve-
ments. Yet, by not even getting on the 
bill, they will be saying to the Amer-
ican people that we don’t care about 
your having a voice in this process or 
being able to see what your elected 
leaders are actually doing to resolve 
this problem in our country. 
That is what this would do. It would 
open it up. It would allow a piece of 
legislation to be brought to the floor; 
allow for a motion to proceed to get on 
it; allow us to open up the amendment 
process and to have a freewheeling, ful-
some debate about each and every one 
of the issues that is involved in this 
legislation. 
They have said that this doesn’t go 
far enough, that it doesn’t do this or 
that it doesn’t do that. Sure, that is 
true. Perhaps, it doesn’t, but it gets 
about 75 percent of the way there. If 
you look at the contents and the sub-
stance of this bill, it represents a lot of 
what both sides have been talking 
about. There are a lot of recommenda-
tions in it that have come forward 
from people across this country who 
have been directly impacted, none 
more so than Senator SCOTT. I can tell 
you Senator SCOTT doesn’t view this as 
a messaging exercise. He views this as 
something that is deeply personal to 
him. Unfortunately, he has experienced 
the pain of racism, not only as a young 
boy, growing up in the South, but as an 
adult and as a U.S. Senator. He wants 
a solution, and we should all want a so-
lution, but that starts by getting on 
the bill and debating it in the open, in 
the light of day. 
The Democratic leader talks about: 
Why can’t we go back behind closed 
doors and negotiate this? Look, we 
have a piece of legislation that rep-
resents 75 percent of what the Demo-
crats say they want, and we can finish 
the other 25 percent. Maybe we will not 
get to 100 percent. Nobody ever, usu-
ally, gets 100 percent of what one wants 
around here. Yet simply having a de-
bate, allowing an open amendment 
process, and allowing the will of the 
U.S. Senate to be heard is all this is 
about. This isn’t about the final bill. 
This isn’t about the final contents. 
This is about whether or not this 
body—100 U.S. Senators—has listened 
enough to what is going on around this 
country to say: We want to have this 
debate. We want to get on this bill, and 
we want to have it in public, in the 
light of day, in front of the American 
people, not behind closed doors—an 
open debate, a fulsome debate, in which 
amendments can be offered and in 
which the American people can observe 
and see it. That is what this vote today 
is about. 
Now, the Democrats will say that, if 
you allow us to get on the bill, then 
they will have no control over what 
will happen after that. Well, actually, 
they will, because it is not just a 60- 
vote threshold to get on the bill; it is 
a 60-vote threshold to get off the bill. 
So, if you want to stop this some-
where—anywhere in the process—you 
will have the opportunity to do that 
because it will take 60 votes to move it 
forward and to ultimately pass it, not 
just to get on it. 
It takes 60 votes—a supermajority 
here in the U.S. Senate. I think it is 
fair to say that, historically, the way 
the Senate has worked on major pieces 
of legislation is it ends up being bipar-
tisan because of the 60-vote threshold. 
There hasn’t been a time since the pop-
ular election of Senators, at least on 
the Republican side, when we have had 
more than 55 votes in the U.S. Senate. 
The Democrats have had 60 a few times 
throughout history, but the Repub-
licans have never had more than 55. So 
we know it is going to take a bipar-
tisan solution, and we know that the 
Democrats’ voice matters. We know 
that, in the end, if you are going to 
have a bipartisan product, you are 
going to have to have input from both 
sides. 
That is what this is about. It is about 
getting on the bill that has been ad-
vanced and put forward by an indi-
vidual, TIM SCOTT—it is a TIM SCOTT 
bill—again, with input from others. It 
is not a McConnell bill. It is a TIM 
SCOTT bill. He is someone who has per-
sonally experienced and felt the very 
frustration and anger that is being 
voiced by the American people across 
the country. He wants a solution. He 
doesn’t want a messaging bill. We want 
a solution. 
Let me just tell you quickly about a 
few of the things that are in this bill, 
which I think suggest that it would be 
really important to get on it and to, at 
least, have a debate. 
One of the most important sections 
of the bill is the George Floyd and Wal-
ter 
Scott 
Notification 
Act, 
which 
would correct deficiencies in law en-
forcement’s reporting of use-of-force 
incidents. Right now, the FBI’s Na-
tional Use-of-Force Data Collection 
only receives data on about 40 percent 
of law enforcement officers—40 per-
cent. That needs to change. The only 
way we can understand the scope of the 
problems we are facing is to have full 
and accurate data—a complete data 
picture—that will allow us to pinpoint 
problems, identify troubled police de-
partments, and develop best practices 
for use-of-force and deescalation train-
ing. 
There are many police departments 
across the Nation that are doing an ex-
cellent job of policing and that are 
keenly interested in becoming still bet-
ter. I recently met with law enforce-
ment leaders back in my home State of 
South Dakota. Among other things, 
they have been participating in listen-
ing sessions with the community since 
George Floyd’s death, and they are 
supportive of new measures that will 
help to ensure that every officer does 
his or her job in the best possible way. 
Yet, while there are a lot of excellent 
police departments out there, there are 
also 
troubled 
departments—depart-
ments that fail to train their officers 
properly and that overlook officer mis-
behavior. We need to identify those de-
partments and demand their reform. 
Collecting full and accurate data on 
use-of-force incidents will help us to do 
just that. 
Another important section of the 
JUSTICE Act focuses on police deesca-
lation and duty-to-intervene training. 
Sometimes police end up using force in 
situations in which force could have 
been avoided simply because they lack 
the necessary training to deescalate a 
situation without the use of force. It 
may be understandable that well-mean-
ing but overwhelmed police officers 
who are in dangerous circumstances 
will sometimes resort to the use of 
force too quickly, but that is not a sit-
uation that we can accept. Every police 
officer in this country should be given 
the kind of training that will ensure 
that the use of force is restricted only 
to those situations in which it is abso-
lutely needed. 
Another key area of the bill—one 
that is absolutely essential to getting 
bad cops off the streets—deals with law 
enforcement records retention. Too 
often, law enforcement officers with 
problematic records, like multiple ex-
cessive use-of-force complaints, man-
age to transfer to new jurisdictions be-
cause the hiring police departments 
never see their full records. That is a 
problem. Bad cops should not be able to 
find new homes in other jurisdictions. 
We can prevent that from happening by 
ensuring that every police department 
is able to access the full disciplinary 
record of any officer it is looking to 
hire. 
The JUSTICE Act would help to 
make sure these records are readily 
available by requiring police depart-
ments to keep officers’ records for at

least 30 years. It would also require 
any police department that hires a new 
officer to obtain a full employment and 
disciplinary record for that officer 
from all of his previous departments. 
There are a lot of other important 
measures in the JUSTICE Act, from 
the funding of body cameras to expand-
ing minority hiring, to developing best 
policing practices. With this legisla-
tion, we have a real chance of improv-
ing policing in this country and of en-
suring that every officer is held to the 
highest standards. 
Our ability to do that is going to de-
pend on one thing, and that is the will-
ingness of the Democrats to come to 
the table. It was disheartening to see 
the Democrats dismiss Senator SCOTT’s 
bill before it had even been released, 
especially because, as I said, many of 
the proposals in the bill have been 
taken directly from earlier bipartisan 
bills. The word, of course, today, is 
that they are planning to block the bill 
without even allowing it to be consid-
ered on the floor. 
The Democrats have spent a lot of 
time talking about police reform, but 
if they want to actually achieve reform 
and not just talk about it, they are 
going to have to decide to move beyond 
politics. Senator SCOTT’s bill is a seri-
ous, wide-ranging bill. It is a common-
sense bill. It is a bill that all of us, 
whichever our party, should be willing 
to agree on. 
As 
I 
said, 
the 
Democrats 
have 
changes they would like to make, and 
the leader has made it clear there will 
be an opportunity for amendments. But 
to refuse even to allow debate on this 
bill suggests the Democrats are more 
interested in attempting to score polit-
ical points on this issue rather than to 
actually do anything about reform. I 
hope that what we are hearing about 
the Democrats’ plans to block this bill 
is wrong. I hope—I really, sincerely, 
hope—that we are going to see the 
Democrats—some 
courageous 
ones— 
come to the table and vote to move for-
ward with debate on this legislation. 
We have a chance to do something 
important 
here—a 
historic 
chance. 
With the JUSTICE Act, we can perma-
nently improve policing in this country 
and bring real hope to those who have 
lost faith in law enforcement, but we 
are going to have to stand together to 
get this done. I urge my colleagues to 
vote, in a few minutes, to move for-
ward on the JUSTICE Act and start the 
process of reform. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the 
civil rights of all Americans and ask 
my colleagues to vote for a process 
today that will lead to laws that will 
protect those civil rights. Unfortu-
nately, the motion to proceed to pre-
determined legislation is just a pre-
determined outcome for a weak bill. 
There is no agreement today by the 
majority leader and the minority lead-
er on a bipartisan bill. Everyone 
around here knows the way to get good 
bipartisan legislation. It starts with a 
committee process that is open and 
public and an amendment process. You 
can, and we have, done things like we 
did with COVID, where we get a bipar-
tisan group of members together to dis-
cuss legislation and put something be-
fore Congress. Or you could bring up a 
bipartisan bill on the Senate floor. But 
that is not what is happening. That is 
not what is happening. 
What is happening is a predetermined 
process to get a bill that is not good 
enough for the American people. Vot-
ing yes is just an attempt to dictate a 
weak outcome when what America 
wants more than anything else is jus-
tice. They want justice, guaranteed by 
a strong Federal response. Leader 
MCCONNELL said, in talking about the 
Republican efforts, ‘‘it would encour-
age smart reforms of law enforcement 
without steamrolling states and local 
communities’ constitutional powers.’’ 
Elsewhere, he said Democrats want to 
overreach, 
‘‘Federalize 
all 
of 
the 
issues.’’ 
Well, with all due respect to the ma-
jority leader, it is called the Federal 
Civil Rights Act for a reason. It wasn’t 
right to deny Rosa Parks a seat on a 
bus when she was fighting for her Con-
stitutional rights. It wasn’t right to 
deny African Americans access to ho-
tels or lunch counters when they were 
fighting for their civil rights. It wasn’t 
right to use police dogs on Black 
women trying to register to vote in 
1964 in Mississippi when they were 
fighting for their voting rights. I guar-
antee you, it is not good enough and 
would not be good enough to give them 
75 percent here. Rosa Parks was not 
looking for 75 percent; she was looking 
for someone to uphold her rights. 
I spoke last night with one of my 
constituents, Stan Barer, who worked 
for Senator Warren Magnuson. As a 
staffer, he drafted the Accommodations 
Clause of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as 
one of his first jobs on the Senate Com-
merce Committee. Can you imagine 
coming to the U.S. Senate as a young 
lawyer and getting a job on the Com-
merce Committee and the first thing 
you have to do is draft the Accom-
modations Clause of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964? 
I can tell you what he told me. He 
said: Advocates then tried to minimize 
the Federal role. That is what we are 
hearing today, minimize the Federal 
role. Where would we be if President 
Kennedy had taken that approach? He 
fought for equal protection under the 
law for access to education and to end 
discrimination and segregation when 
Southern Governors wouldn’t do so. 
There is a Federal role in protecting 
the civil liberties of all Americans, and 
we should not be abdicating it today 
with this vote. 
Congress passed the Civil Rights Act 
of 1871 after the Civil War when Black 
Americans faced violence from the 
KKK and White supremacists in South-
ern States. It gave them the right to 
seek relief in Federal court when their 
Constitutional rights were deprived by 
someone acting in official capacity. It 
is those same civil rights that we 
should be upholding today, upholding 
those rights—making sure that there is 
not police brutality. That is what the 
U.S. Department of Justice is supposed 
to do. It is supposed to fight to uphold 
those rights. But we know we have a 
problem because President Trump and 
Attorney General Barr have repeatedly 
abdicated those responsibilities, have 
failed to uphold those civil rights. Be-
cause as the top law enforcement offi-
cer in the land, Attorney General Barr 
could be directing and supervising U.S. 
attorneys and prosecuting those Fed-
eral crimes as violations of civil rights. 
Well, I know that that is what Presi-
dent Obama did. I know that he worked 
hard to make sure the U.S. DOJ Civil 
Rights Division oversaw pattern and 
practices of police abuses and entered a 
number of consent decrees with major 
cities, including in my State. Yes, the 
Attorney General is supposed to uphold 
the Fourth Amendment protections 
against unreasonable seizure and the 
civil rights laws that protect against 
excessive use of force. But that is not 
what is happening. Under the Trump 
administration and Attorney General 
Barr, the U.S. Department of Justice 
Civil Rights Division police practice 
group has been reduced to half. It has 
not opened a major pattern or practice 
investigation, and Trump and his ad-
ministration have been pulling away 
from this important role. It started 
with Jeff Sessions. Jeff Sessions made 
it harder to reach consent decrees with 
cities. So instead of playing the Fed-
eral role that we are supposed to play, 
we have an administration that is ena-
bling bad practices to continue by not 
stopping them. 
So, yes, there is a Federal role, there 
is a Federal role here today, just as 
there is with voting rights, just as 
there is with access to public places, 
just as there is with education and 
fighting discrimination. In fact, I think 
that is the central question of this de-
bate. Are we going to have a strong 
Federal role in protecting the Con-
stitutional rights of all Americans to 
prevent excessive force by police? It is 
pretty basic. We want to see a law that 
says 
that 
choke 
holds 
should 
be 
banned. We are not looking for 75 per-
cent, we are not looking for study and 
analysis, we are looking to protect the 
Constitutional rights of all Americans. 
So it is no surprise that the NAACP 
and Urban League have said that this 
legislation that our colleagues have 
proposed on the other side of the aisle 
does not meet the moment to end ra-
cial justice. I ask my colleagues, when 
are we going to? Maybe the informa-
tion age has laid bare for us and all our 
eyes to see that this problem has to be 
resolved. 
Are we going to uphold the Fourth 
Amendment rights against unreason-
able seizure and the civil rights pro-
tecting against excessive use of force

by police? Are we going to uphold the 
rights of all Americans, or just some 
Americans? I would say to my col-
leagues, if we are not upholding all the 
Americans’ rights, then we aren’t real-
ly upholding America’s civil rights. We 
have to ask ourselves, what moment 
are we living in when somebody thinks 
75 percent is enough, and it is study 
and analysis, when we are talking 
about protecting the rights of all 
Americans? 
My mom has been ill and so I’ve been 
spending a lot of time with her talking 
about family history, talking about 
this moment in our history, and she 
told me a story of how she was a young 
girl. She was born in 1932, so you can 
imagine the era that she lived through. 
But she told me when her older brother 
got to go to school, she got to stay 
home and ride his tricycle, so she 
thought that was the best. You know, 
he started kindergarten, she could ride 
his tricycle up and down the alley. And 
she met a woman, an African-American 
woman, who became her friend—her 
first real friend as a young child. 
And she got to know that woman so 
well that my grandparents, in the 
neighboring building, helped with an 
election and saw that people were lin-
ing up to vote. White people were al-
lowed to come into the building and be 
warm, but the African-American people 
had to stay outside in the cold and 
wouldn’t be allowed to come into the 
building to vote, a great discourage-
ment. Thank God my grandfather went 
out and built a bonfire and then left to 
go to work. 
But when you look at the history of 
our country—and we still see voter 
suppression issues today—that is why 
we have to ask ourselves the funda-
mental question. When it comes to the 
civil rights of Americans, a report, 75 
percent, is not enough. A clear line 
ending excessive abuse and declaring 
choke holds illegal is where we need to 
be. 
I ask my colleagues to turn down 
this measure on a weak, predetermined 
path and get a real bipartisan effort 
and uphold the civil liberties of Ameri-
cans because, I guarantee you, America 
really is watching. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I stand 
before this body today with a troubled 
heart, as most of us do, but that is not 
good enough. We have to kind of put 
away our own biases, our own preju-
dice. I am not talking about racial; I 
am talking about political. 
Today we have an opportunity to do 
something, to start a process. Words 
are cheap in this body. I hear a lot of 
empty words. I hope not to add to that 
quantity today. 
When I was a kid growing up in the 
Deep South, Martin Luther King wrote 
a letter from a jail cell in Birmingham 
to Black preachers in that community. 
He encouraged them to turn away from 
the violence that had such a poten-
tially devastating impact and to seek 
reform peacefully; that in the long 
term, that was the better approach. My 
father had me read that letter. I gave a 
speech a couple years ago, and I quoted 
from that letter. It meant something 
to me as a young White man in the 
Deep South. 
Almost 57 years ago, on the other end 
of the National Mall from where we 
stand today, Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., I believe, changed the world—cer-
tainly impacted millions of lives. 
Standing before thousands of people, 
he shared his dream. He dreamed of a 
world where justice would prevail over 
prejudice. He dreamed of an America 
where everyone would be judged not by 
the color of their skin but by the depth 
of their character. 
Since that day in 1963, a lot has 
changed in our country for the better. 
Unfortunately, Dr. King’s vision of ra-
cial justice, harmony, and equality is 
yet to be fully realized. That is unac-
ceptable. 
This year, our country is seeing dev-
astating tragedies taking place in our 
communities, but what we see on TV 
really is the tip of the iceberg, as a lot 
of my friends from those communities 
tell me. I believe them. 
We need to make sure that the funda-
mental issue of fairness is upheld by all 
law enforcement agencies so everyone 
gets treated equally, fairly, period. The 
tragedies we have seen are unaccept-
able by any measure, and I don’t think 
anybody in America thinks that what 
we have seen is right. Those who are 
responsible need to be prosecuted to 
the fullest extent of the law, and we 
need to put a full stop to it right now. 
But that fight starts today, I believe, 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
Like so many Americans, my wife 
Bonnie and I have spent a lot of time 
reflecting and praying for our country 
and our friends and our fellow Ameri-
cans in the last many weeks. It is clear 
to us that we have more work to do to 
make justice for all become a reality 
for every American. 
We are a nation of laws, but those 
laws have to be enforced fairly and 
equally. To truly be effective, the po-
lice need to have the confidence of the 
communities they serve, and in many 
cases today, that is just not the case. 
That trust and confidence must be 
earned, however. Clearly, there is much 
work to do on this front to build up 
mutual trust. 
I had a conversation with two grand-
mothers last week—well-educated, suc-
cessful women of color, in positions of 
tremendous 
responsibility—and 
we 
talked about how their perspective and 
my perspective differed and how we 
saw each other in this crisis. But the 
most telling thing in that conversation 
was how they told me their No. 1 con-
cern was for their grandsons and how 
their grandsons would be treated by 
members of the police force in their 
communities. That is a tragedy, and we 
can do something about it. 
This issue is personal to me. Growing 
up in middle Georgia in the 1960s, I 
have seen the devastation of racism, 
discrimination, a lack of equality, prej-
udice. As the son of two public school 
teachers, I saw how it weighed on my 
parents during that time. All they 
wanted was for every child to be treat-
ed equally, regardless of where they 
came from, what their name was, or 
the color of their skin. 
Understand, I grew up in a military 
town, and we had people there from all 
over the world. So this wasn’t an idle 
conversation; this was an objective 
they tried to live up to every single 
day. They wanted every child to have 
the same simple opportunity. 
As superintendent of schools in our 
county, my father successfully inte-
grated our school system—I remember 
that as a young kid—one of the first 
counties to do that in our State. They 
did it there without incident. It was a 
military town. We had people, again, 
from all over the world, and it was a 
joint effort. My dad did not do it be-
cause it was the easy thing to do, the 
convenient thing to do; he did it be-
cause it was the right thing to do. 
In my own life, I have been blessed to 
have interacted with people from all 
over the world in my career. My home-
town of Warner Robins is a military 
town. I went to school there, went to 
church there, and played ball there 
with people literally from all over the 
world. Later on, my wife Bonnie and I 
had the opportunity to live around the 
world in different places. This chal-
lenged our perspective in many ways. 
It helped us develop a deeper apprecia-
tion of how America’s diversity is at 
once our greatest asset and, yes, some-
times our greatest challenge. 
However, I also recognize that as a 
White man, my perspective is by defi-
nition very different from those of Af-
rican Americans in my own commu-
nity. We have these conversations all 
the time. I know I could never fully ap-
preciate the pain and adversity many 
African Americans have faced in my 
lifetime and still face today. That is 
wrong. We can fix that starting today 
or at least start down that road again. 
Yes, we have made a lot of progress— 
I can see that in my own lifetime—but 
that is no reason to ignore the situa-
tion today or to sit back and not do 
anything. However, as Dr. King said at 
the Lincoln Memorial, we will ‘‘not be 
satisfied until justice rolls down like 
water and righteousness like a mighty 
stream.’’ 
Right now, the Senate has the oppor-
tunity to fight for justice for all. 
Today we will be voting to—it is a 
technicality, but it is a motion to pro-
ceed. This is nothing more than to just 
start on the bill. 
I hear my Democratic colleagues 
talking about, well, it is not perfect; it 
is only 75 percent of the solution. Well, 
OK. Great. Let’s start there. The pur-
pose of a motion to proceed is to put a 
bill on the floor and actually debate it, 
have amendments. This bill is not per-
fect. It doesn’t satisfy all the things I 
want to do. But it is a start. I plan to

offer amendments. I am sure the Pre-
siding Officer wants to offer amend-
ments. We welcome amendments in 
this process. The majority leader has 
said we will have an open amendment 
process. What we want to do is offer up 
this as a starting point, not a final so-
lution. 
Today we will have the vote on 
whether to start actually working on 
the JUSTICE Act. Senator TIM SCOTT 
has led a small task force to come up 
with the starting point—a bill that we 
can actually put our hands on, read, 
and then start changing. I am proud to 
be a cosponsor. We have many cospon-
sors. I think that we will probably have 
a unanimous vote on that on the Re-
publican side today. My prayer is that 
we will have many on the Democratic 
side say: Look, we understand it is not 
perfect. We want this. We want that. 
Let’s put in the work, and let’s start 
working on this now. It should be a 
foregone conclusion that we get over-
whelming bipartisan support to debate 
the bill. Let’s make it a good law. If it 
is not to your satisfaction, fine. Let’s 
debate it. 
Some say: Well, we don’t trust the 
majority leader. 
You don’t have to trust the majority 
leader. The rules of the Senate protect 
each individual Senator once we put 
the bill in play. But if we don’t put the 
bill on the floor, nobody is protected— 
especially our constituents. 
Unfortunately, many of my col-
leagues on the other side are attempt-
ing to shut down this debate before we 
even start. They say it doesn’t go far 
enough. They call it a token. That is 
absurd. That is ridiculous. It is insult-
ing, particularly to my good friend TIM 
SCOTT. 
Look, none of us believes this bill is 
perfect or an end-all as it is. As I just 
said, we have differences on this side, 
but we are willing to put it on the 
floor. We have allowed the Democrats 
to do things like this where we went on 
the floor and tried to debate a bill to 
get it to where—if you don’t like what 
we end up with, you can always vote it 
down at cloture. You don’t have to 
even go to the final vote. 
All we are pleading for today is a mo-
tion to proceed to allow this bill to go 
on the floor and be fully debated. It is 
simply a starting point for debate and 
true compromise. Isn’t that what our 
job is? Isn’t that what we are supposed 
to do? 
I ask my Democratic colleagues this: 
What major bill has come before this 
body in perfect form at the very out-
set? I can’t think of any. If you have 
issues with this bill, let’s debate it and 
offer amendments. Don’t let perfect be 
the enemy of the good, please. 
On major issues like this, it is our 
duty to come together. It is our duty to 
find common ground. It is our duty to 
fight for what is right. 
This bill offers meaningful solutions 
that will help build trust between law 
enforcement and the communities they 
serve. These are just ideas. It provides 
solutions that all of us can get behind 
right now. 
In addition to modifying the rules 
concerning the use of force and pro-
viding body cams, this bill does several 
critical things to establish that trust 
and provide additional funding to help 
improve our police forces. 
First, it incentivizes police recruit-
ing to reflect the demographics of the 
communities they serve. How simple is 
that? This is a big step. If the police 
live in the communities they serve, if 
they reflect the demographics of that 
community, if they identify with the 
people of that community, it is a lot 
easier to develop trust and common 
ground. 
Second, this bill encourages deescala-
tion training for law enforcement offi-
cers. This will help law enforcement 
develop the skills and techniques they 
need to prevent public interactions 
that lead to the violence we have seen 
of late. 
Third, this bill creates a database 
that helps our communities root out 
those who do not serve the public even 
though they are enforcing law. 
The bottom line is that the bill in-
creases funding for law enforcement. It 
doesn’t defend law enforcement or 
eliminate the police force. 
These solutions we are offering up as 
a starting point today are meaningful. 
They will restore the confidence of our 
communities and hold accountable po-
lice officers who abuse their positions 
or who are poorly trained. 
Most of us who truly want change 
also understand that eliminating police 
forces is not the answer, as some sug-
gest. Our police forces are to serve and 
protect our communities—all of our 
communities—and there needs to be 
change before they can be successful in 
that. 
We have proven in the past that we 
can come together to fight for what is 
right. We did when we provided perma-
nent funding for our HBCUs, our his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities. We did it when we created oppor-
tunity zones in hundreds of commu-
nities of color around the country, 
many 
of 
them 
economically 
chal-
lenged. In 2018, when we passed the bi-
partisan criminal justice reform bill— 
the biggest one in the last 50 years— 
that was true progress. We did it. We 
can do it again today, but first we have 
to put this bill on the floor. We have to 
start the debate. We have to pass this 
motion to proceed, or—guess what—no 
debate will happen. They will talk to 
their base, Republicans will talk to our 
base, and nothing will happen. A pox 
on all of us if we let that happen. 
If Democrats shut down this bill 
today, it will demonstrate a lack of 
sincerity, in my opinion, to at least en-
gage in finding solutions. This is no 
different from the immigration con-
versation we had just a couple years 
ago. When the President of the United 
States, Donald Trump, offered up a 
pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million 
DACA recipients and we couldn’t even 
get a debate going with the other 
side—they turned it down out of hand 
because it was President Trump’s sug-
gestion. 
All of us need to remember that 
while we look different, we might talk 
differently, we certainly may think dif-
ferently, we really are one Nation 
under God. 
Our diversity is our strength. It 
makes us different. It makes us strong-
er. It makes us the leader of the world 
in our current time. What unites us is 
far greater than what divides us. 
Let’s work on this bill today and 
start building a more perfect union for 
every American. Let’s vote yes on this 
motion to proceed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

that the order for the quorum call be 
rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I ask unanimous consent to 
complete my remarks before the roll-
call vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, we come here today with an 
opportunity to say to America and spe-
cifically to communities of color: We 
see you. We hear you. I have experi-
enced your pain. 
I have been stopped 18 times in the 
last two decades, and 1 year, I was 
stopped seven times, as an elected offi-
cial in this body, trying to get into the 
Chamber and into the office buildings 
on the congressional side. 
I understand some part of what too 
many have experienced. This police re-
form legislation addresses that. It pro-
vides clear opportunities for us to say: 
Not only do we hear you, not only do 
we see you, but we are responding to 
your pain, because we in America be-
lieve that justice should be applied 
equally to all of our citizens, with no 
exceptions, and when we see excep-
tions, it is our responsibility to do 
something about those exceptions, and 
this legislation helps us get there. 
I say to my colleagues on the other 
side, we received a letter from Senator 
SCHUMER saying that there were five 
things about the JUSTICE Act that did 
not meet their principles. My response 
was a simple one: Let’s have five 
amendments on those things. If we can 
get the votes on these two sides of the 
Chamber, we should include that in the 
legislation. 
I met with other Senators on the 
other side who said that there are more 
than five things that we need to have a 
conversation about. I said: Let’s in-
clude an amendment for every single

issue you have. They did not stick 
around for that meeting. 
My concern is that 80 percent just 
won’t do. My concern is that our 
friends on the other side will not take 
advantage of this opportunity to say to 
the communities that are suffering: We 
see you. We hear you. We are willing to 
respond as one body. 
I implore all of us to vote for the mo-
tion to proceed so that if there are rec-
ommendations that come in the form 
of amendments, we have a vote up or 
down on those amendments. I have of-
fered as many amendments as nec-
essary for this bill to be seen by the 
public, and, in consultation with the 
other side, let it be their bill—not TIM 
SCOTT’s bill, not the Republican bill, 
not the Democrat bill, but a bill that 
starts to address the issues that have 
plagued this Nation for decades. 
This is not my first start at this leg-
islation. I started on this bill 5 years 
ago, but I could not find voices that 
would push forward reforms brought to 
our attention by the Walter Scott 
shooting in 2013. 
I will close with this: I respect people 
with whom I disagree. They have the 
right to disagree. My pastor tells me I 
have the right to be wrong, which 
means I am not right all the time. But 
on this bill, if you don’t think we are 
right, make it better. Don’t walk away. 
Vote for the motion to proceed so that 
we have an opportunity to deal with 
this very real threat to the America 
that is civil, that is balanced. This is 
an opportunity to say yes—to say yes 
not to us but to those folks who are 
waiting for our leadership to stand and 
be counted.

an opportunity to reconsider the vote 
without waiting for 2 days, I changed 
my vote and moved to reconsider, 
which means that it could come back 
at any time should progress be made.

Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous

call be waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I yield 2 minutes to the Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I stand 
in strong support of and solidarity with 
my colleague and good friend from 
South Carolina, TIM SCOTT. 
It was 5 years ago when a White man 
walked into a church in Charleston, 
SC. After going through 1 hour of Bible 
study—after they prayed for him and 
read the Bible to him—he pulled out a 
gun and shot the nine people in that 
Bible study. 
Not long after that, the Presiding Of-
ficer and I attended one of the funerals 
in Charleston, SC, and TIM was there. 
Any other city in America would not 
have dealt with it the way Charleston, 
SC, did. Charleston, SC, dealt with it 
with love, which is something we don’t 
talk about very often, and TIM SCOTT 
was there. Because of his time in grade 
and because of that mayor and because 
of the Black leaders in that town and 
the time in grade they had had with 
each other, they moved forward and 
overcame that tragedy. 
Five years ago, TIM SCOTT put a bill 
on this floor, and we ended up then in 
exactly the same place we are now— 
doing absolutely nothing. How many 
more Black men and women will have 
to die in America before this body 
stops playing politics with race? 
It is very clear to me, in having 
worked hard on justice reform, that 
there are opportunities—with $75 bil-
lion going into the most economically 
challenged communities in our coun-
try—because of TIM SCOTT, President 
Trump, and all that we are doing. 
HBCUs—our historically Black colleges 
and universities—are stronger today 
because of President Trump than they 
ever have been. 
The time to act is now and to stop 
playing politics and pandering to the 
Democratic base, and let’s get some-
thing done. This bill was never in-
tended to be an end all. It was intended 
to be a platform for constructive de-
bate, and here we are with only two 
Democratic Senators voting to even 
start the debate. 
I yield to Senator TIM SCOTT. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I 
thank the Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. President, there is scripture in 
the Bible in the Book of Ezekiel, chap-
ter 33, somewhere around verse 6. This 
scripture talks about a watchman on a 
wall, and his job is to simply say there 
is danger coming. It is a very impor-
tant job. The watchman’s job is to sim-
ply say there is danger coming. 
As Senator PERDUE said, I had that 
conversation 5 years ago. I didn’t find 
anyone on the other side who was will-
ing to engage in that conversation 
then, and here we are 5 years later. 
There is danger coming. I want us to 
hear this clearly because, as we look 
out on the streets of America and we 
see more unrest and we see more chal-
lenging situations, realize that there is 
danger coming. 
The watchman’s responsibility is to 
call out the danger, and as the blood-
shed happens, the blood, according to 
Ezekiel, will not be on the hands of the 
watchman, but if he does not shout 
out, if he does not articulate that there 
is danger coming, then the blood will 
be on his hands. 
There is danger coming. We are in 
dangerous times. The source of this 
danger is not the failure of this bill on 
this floor at this time. No, this is mere-
ly a symptom of the danger that, I be-
lieve, is right in front of us. This is 
only a symptom of a much deeper 
issue—a systemic problem. Let me ex-
plain. 
I am a kid who grew up in poverty— 
in abject poverty in many ways. There 
is much worse poverty in America and, 
certainly, around the world than that 
in which I grew up. I am talking about 
the poverty of when you come home 
and hit the light switch, and there is 
no light. I am talking about the kind of 
poverty of having a phone attached to 
the wall, and when you picked it up, 
there was no sound. There are people 
who have lived in worse poverty than I, 
but that is poverty from my perspec-
tive, and I lived in that poverty. 
One of the challenging situations of 
poverty that manifests is hopelessness. 
I was that hopeless kid in America, 
mired in poverty, in a single-parent 
household, under the impression that 
the only way I could escape poverty 
would be through athletics or through 
entertainment. I was hopeless. From 7 
years old to 14 years old, I drifted, and 
all drifting leads one in the wrong di-
rection. I failed high school. I embar-
rassed my mom, who was working 16 
hours a day, because I felt there was no 
hope in this country for a little Black 
boy like me—14 years old. I failed 
Spanish, English, world geography, and 
civics. 
Civics, as we all know, is as close as 
it gets to failing politics. I will say 
that, today, this body, as a whole, is 
failing civics, or is failing in politics. 
As the Lord would have it, I had an 
amazing mother who believed that it 
was her responsibility to pray me out 
of the hard situations I found myself 
in, and I had the good fortune of meet-
ing a mentor after I got through sum-
mer school, who redirected me. I pulled 
myself together with the help of a pow-
erful family, a praying grandmother, 
and a whole lot of faith. I caught up 
with my class, and I graduated on 
time. I earned a small football scholar-
ship. I went to college and earned a de-
gree in political science. 
Along the way, as a youngster, I 
joined the NAACP. I joined the Urban 
League. I joined many organizations in 
the community because I knew that 
part of my responsibility was to be so-
cially engaged and to make a dif-
ference no matter how small that dif-
ference would be. The one organization 
I didn’t even think about joining was 
the Republican Party. Why would I 
ever think about joining the Repub-
lican Party? While growing up, every 
African American and every Black per-
son I knew of was wed to the Demo-
cratic Party because it was better to 
have a seat in the room than to be out-
side. That was the heritage I grew up 
in. 
Let me fast-forward to where we are 
today, and I will return to that. 
We lost—I lost—a vote today on a 
piece of legislation that would have led 
to the systemic change in the relation-
ship between communities of color and 
the law enforcement community. We 
would have broken this concept in this 
Nation that somehow, some way, you 
have to either be for law enforcement 
or for communities of color. That is a 
false binary choice. It is just not true. 
This legislation spoke to the impor-
tant issues that have brought us here 
today. We wouldn’t be here, as Senator 
PERDUE alluded to, if it were not for 
the death of yet another African-Amer-
ican man, George Floyd. His murder is 
why the country has given us the op-
portunity to lead, but my friends on 
the other side just said no, not no to 
the legislation. They just said no. 
Why am I saying that they didn’t 
just say no to the legislation? 
It is that, along the way, I sat down 
with many of them and asked: What do 
you need? 
Senator SCHUMER sent a letter, tell-
ing, I believe it was, Senator MCCON-
NELL that there were five things in the 
legislation that needed to be improved. 
I said: Let’s give them the five amend-
ments. 
I sat down with more Senators, and 
they said: Wait. It is not just five. 
There are 20. I asked: How about 20 
amendments? And they walked out. 
You see, this process is not broken 
because of the legislation. This is a

broken process beyond that one piece 
of legislation. 
It is one of the reasons why commu-
nities of color—young Americans of all 
colors—are losing faith in the institu-
tions of authority and power in this 
Nation, because we are playing small 
ball. We are playing for those in the in-
sulated chambers. We are playing for 
Presidential politics. That is small 
ball. Playing the big boys’ game is 
playing for the kids who can’t rep-
resent themselves, and if you don’t like 
what you see, change it. 
We offered them opportunities—at 
least 20, I offered—to change it, and 
their answer to me was, you can’t offer 
us 20 amendments. 
I said: Why not? 
They 
said: 
Well, 
because 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL won’t give you 20 amend-
ments. 
I spoke to MITCH
MCCONNELL. He 
said: You can have 20 amendments. 
I told them that. 
We went to a press conference yester-
day, and we said: An open process. 
They didn’t want an open process. 
They want one thing. I am going to get 
to that. 
So I asked my friends—I said: What 
is it you don’t like about where we are 
going? 
They said: Well, the data collection 
area. This is the problem. The data col-
lection area is the problem. 
I said: Well, tell me the problem. 
Well, the problem is that we are not 
collecting data. 
I am like, well, wait a second. I could 
have sworn when I wrote the legisla-
tion, we were collecting data. So I 
flipped through the pages and realized 
we are collecting data for serious bod-
ily injury and death. 
They said: Well, we want to collect 
data on all uses of force. 
I said: Put it in an amendment, and I 
will support it. 
That was just one bone of contention. 
I said: Well, tell me another one. 
They said: Our bone of contention is 
that we need you to ban no-knock war-
rants because of the Breonna Taylor 
situation. 
I said: Your bill does not ban no- 
knock warrants for the Breonna Taylor 
situation; your bill bans it for Federal 
agents. There was not a Secret Service 
agent showing up at Breonna Taylor’s 
door; that was a local police depart-
ment. 
So the fact that they are saying they 
want to ban no-knock warrants know-
ing they cannot ban no-knock warrants 
tells me that this is not about the un-
derlying issue. It is bigger than that. 
I said: Well, I will give you an amend-
ment, though, and we can have that 
fight on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
As a matter of fact, I said: Tell me 
any issue you have with the legisla-
tion. 
Well, we went through deescalation 
training, the duty to intervene, best 
practices. 
I said: In the legislation. In the legis-
lation. In the legislation. 
I thought—you know, I don’t have 
any hair, so I didn’t pull it out, but 
here is what I said next. I said: Well, 
let’s talk about tactics, then. 
They said: Well, you don’t ban choke 
holds. 
I was like, I could have sworn I 
banned choke holds in there some-
where, and then I read the bill. They 
don’t ban choke holds at the local 
level, at the State level. Do you know 
why? There is this little thing called 
the Constitution. They can’t ban choke 
holds. Eric Gardner’s situation would 
not have been cured by their ban on 
choke holds because their ban on choke 
holds was for Federal agents. Our legis-
lation instructed the Attorney General 
to ban choke holds for Federal agents. 
What else did we do? Well, we said we 
would reduce funding by 20 percent. 
They reduced funding by 10 percent. So 
our penalty was twice the penalty of 
the other side, and this is supposed to 
be an issue. 
I am not sure we have found the 
issue. We haven’t. It is not choke 
holds. It is not the duty to intervene. It 
is not data collection, because I said: 
On choke holds? 
They said: Senator—I sat there at 
their meeting with them—it is your 
definition of ‘‘choke holds’’ that is the 
problem. 
See, I assumed that when you think 
of choke holds, you think of a choke 
hold, but there is a distinction of the 
carotid airflow versus blood flow. They 
said ours covered only one, not the 
other. 
I said: OK. You can have an amend-
ment. I will vote for it. We will change 
it. 
They said: We are not here to talk 
about that. 
I said: Wait a second. If we are not 
here to debate the issue on the motion 
to proceed so that we can fix not 50 
percent of the bill, not 70 percent of the 
bill, 
but 
literally 
slivers, 
slight 
changes on parts of the bill that would 
move this entire process forward, and 
you have the amendment to do so—I 
even said something that I didn’t think 
I would say. I said: What about a man-
agers’ amendment? Let’s just fix every-
thing in one fell swoop. 
They said: No, thank you. 
So I find it disingenuous that people 
say: Well, why don’t you just sit down 
with one Member and work it out? 
Well, if a managers’ amendment 
won’t do it, if the 5 amendments they 
wrote in a letter saying that they need-
ed to have these things fixed won’t do 
it, if 20 amendments won’t do it, and 
you have an open process on the floor 
of the U.S. Senate that requires 60 
votes to get off of the bill, then what, 
pray tell, is the problem? 
Well, I finally realized what the prob-
lem is. The actual problem is not what 
is being offered; it is who is offering it. 
It took me a long time to figure out 
the most obvious thing in the room. It 
is not the what. I have listened to the 
press conferences. I have read the 
newspapers. I am not sure that anyone 
who is actually reporting on the bill 
has actually read the bill, because the 
next time I see another story or edi-
torial that says we don’t do this, their 
bill does that, and you put the two to-
gether, and it is not just off, it is just 
dead wrong—I realized, finally, it is the 
who that is offering this. 
I have dealt with the problem of who 
before. As a Black man, I get the who 
being the problem. It is one of the rea-
sons I went to Senator MCCONNELL and 
said: I want to lead this conversation. 
I am the person in our conference who 
has experienced firsthand racial dis-
crimination, racial profiling by law en-
forcement, and I am still a fan because 
I believe that most law enforcement of-
ficers are good. But I am the guy. I am 
your guy, MITCH, because this is my 
issue. This is an issue for every poor 
kid growing up in every poor neighbor-
hood in this Nation who feels like, 
when I leave my home for a jog, I 
might not come back. 
This is a serious issue. This is an 
issue for every single kid who says: Is 
this my country? We have heard no. 
This is the issue that we should be 
solving, not the legislative issue. That 
is not the issue. The issue is, do we 
matter? We had an opportunity to say: 
You matter so much, we will stay on 
this floor for as long as it takes and as 
many amendments as it takes for us to 
get to the issue that says ‘‘Yes, you 
matter.’’ But we said no today. Fifty- 
six people said yes—four short—four 
short of saying yes; yes to having 
enough information to direct training 
and resources in such a way that we 
could hold people accountable. We were 
four votes short of saying yes to having 
a powerful tool of pulling resources to 
compel behavior on choke holds, be-
cause I believe that if we had gotten on 
the bill, we would have passed this bill. 
But that is the problem, by the way. 
That is the who I am talking about. 
See, as a Black guy, I know how it feels 
to walk into a store and have the little 
clerk follow me around, even as a U.S. 
Senator. I get that. I have experienced 
that. I understand the traffic stops. I 
understand that when I am walking 
down the street and some young lady 
clutches her purse and my instinct is 
to get a little farther away because I 
don’t want any issues with anybody. I 
understand that. But what I miss in 
this issue is that the stereotyping of 
Republicans is just as toxic as poison 
to the outcomes for the most vulner-
able communities in this Nation. That 
is the issue. 
When Speaker PELOSI says one of the 
most heinous things I can imagine— 
that the Republicans are actually try-
ing to cover up murder, the murder of 
George Floyd, with our legislation— 
that is not politics. That is not a game 
to win. That is, you lose—you will 
sooner or later lose—but immediately, 
every kid around the Nation who heard 
that nonsense lost at that moment. 
You see, what has become evident to 
me is that she knows something that 
we all know. She knows she can say

that because the Democrats have a mo-
nopoly on the Black vote. No matter 
the return on their loyalty—and I am 
telling you, the most loyal part of the 
Democratic construct is Black commu-
nities—no matter the loyalty of the 
people, the return they get will always 
continue to go down because in monop-
olies, you start devaluing your cus-
tomer. 
You see, today we could have given 
at the very minimum 70 percent of 
what they say would be important for 
the people we say we serve, but instead 
of having a debate on that today and 
not getting 5 amendments but 20 
amendments, 
a 
managers’ 
amend-
ment—instead of going forward and 
getting what you want now, they have 
decided to punt this ball until the elec-
tion. Do you know why? Because they 
believe that the polls reflect a 15-point 
deficit on our side; therefore, they can 
get the bill they want in November. All 
they have to do is win the election, and 
then roll in January, and they get a 
chance to write the police reform bill 
without our support at all. 
Well, this is what they did in the 
House, right? No amendments in the 
House of Representatives on their bill. 
We are saying amendments on our side. 
Democrats are saying no amendments 
in the House, but you here in the U.S. 
Senate, because we are the world’s 
greater deliberative body, you can have 
amendments—not in the House, not 
under Speaker PELOSI, but under Lead-
er MCCONNELL, you get at least 20 
amendments. And I thought, what the 
heck, I will throw in the managers’ 
amendment too. But that was not good 
enough because the irony of the story 
is not the bill; the irony of the story is 
that today and through the rest of 
June and all of July, what we are going 
to have here is, instead of gaining 70 
percent of what you wanted, or more, 
you are going to get zero. How is that 
for a return? How is that for loyalty? 
How does that work for the little kid 
at home in North Charleston where 
Walter Scott got shot? How does that 
work around the country when, instead 
of getting 70 percent of what you want-
ed, today and tomorrow and next week 
you get zero, and you are going to wait 
until the election to get more? OK. 
Well, why wouldn’t you take the 80 per-
cent now, see if you can win the elec-
tion, and add on the other 20 percent? 
You have got to be kidding me. 
Because the who matters, they can-
not allow this party to be seen as a 
party that reaches out to all commu-
nities in this Nation. Unfortunately, 
without the kind of objectivity in the 
media that is necessary to share the 
message of what is actually happening, 
no one will ever know because if you 
don’t read it in the paper, it must not 
have happened. If you don’t see it on 
TV, on MSNBC or CNN, it must not be 
true. That is a problem. 
Let me just say this: I think we are 
willing to compete for every vote ev-
erywhere, all the time. That might not 
be true in every corridor of the Nation, 
but it is true of most corridors of the 
Nation. And this party has reinforced 
that truth, not by the words coming 
out of my mouth but by the actual leg-
islation signed into law. 
Senator 
PERDUE
started 
talking 
about the important work that we did 
on opportunity zones—and I am going 
to wrap it up in 2 minutes here. It is 
lunchtime. 
In 2017 we passed tax reform. I in-
cluded in the opportunity zones—$75 
billion—real money to the most dis-
tressed communities in this Nation. 
How did that happen? Well, President 
Trump and I had a serious disagree-
ment on his comments after Char-
lottesville. He, being a person I was not 
looking forward to having a conversa-
tion with, invited me to the Oval Of-
fice. I sat down with him, and I said: 
What do you want to talk about? 
The President said: Tell me about 
your perspective on racial history. 
I was stunned because if you know 
President Trump like I know President 
Trump, his love language is not words 
of encouragement. It just ain’t. I know 
‘‘ain’t’’ ain’t a word, but it is not. 
He listened, and at the end of our 
conversation, he simply said: Tell me 
how to help those I have offended. 
I didn’t know what to say, so I pulled 
out my back pocket and got oppor-
tunity zones. I didn’t go there prepared 
for him to listen. That is not supposed 
to be funny, but it is. I mean, I didn’t 
expect him to listen, but he did. He lis-
tened. He leaned in, and he said: Tell 
me how to help the folks I have of-
fended. 
I said: Let’s work on opportunity 
zones together. 
He said: Yes. 
I said: What? 
He said: Yes. 
He was concerned enough about the 
communities he had literally just of-
fended. He was concerned enough to go 
to work on their behalf. And that is 
why we have opportunity zones. 
I was like, well, this might work 
again. So I went back to the President 
and said: You know, there is a lot of 
work that needs to be done around the 
HBCUs, historically Black colleges and 
universities. He said yes. He said yes. 
We said yes. 
Let me just tell you this: When we 
started saying yes, we controlled the 
White House, we controlled the Senate, 
and we controlled the House. So it 
wasn’t because some Democrat came 
over here and said: In order to get our 
votes, you have to do this. That is not 
what happened. He said yes because the 
Republican Party said yes. We stood 
together with all three leaders of gov-
ernment under our control. We got op-
portunity zones done. We started a 
process of reinvesting in historically 
Black colleges and universities. And 
the head of the United Negro College 
Fund said at my last fly-in that this is 
a record level of funding ever—his 
words, not mine. I am not sure what 
‘‘ever’’ is. Maybe that is longer than I 
have been alive. Literally more money 
for HBCUs than ever—brought to you 
by the Republican Party. 
I said: Well, that is working. Let’s do 
it again. 
So we went to stem cell research, 
which—stem cell research for sickle 
cell anemia, which is a 100-percent—ba-
sically speaking, 99.5 percent—African- 
American disease. He said yes. 
LAMAR ALEXANDER, the chairman of 
our Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee—we were fighting 
over funding for HBCUs. We made it 
permanent—permanent funding for the 
HBCUs led by a Republican chairman 
of the Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee, President Trump 
signs it, and we have delivered historic 
funding and permanent funding for 
HBCUs. 
Because I am running out of time, I 
am not going to go through the pre- 
pandemic numbers in minority commu-
nities for unemployment—unemploy-
ment not only at a record low, but we 
had labor force participation rates in-
creasing. Let me say that differently. 
Not only did we get more jobs for 
Black folks and Brown folks, but the 
number of folks in the community—we 
started having an increase in the num-
ber of folks working. 
This is called basic conservative poli-
tics. It works, creating 7 million new 
jobs benefiting two-thirds of African 
Americans, Hispanics, and women, and 
with a full economy, all boats started 
rising. Don’t believe me, check your 
accounts. That is what it looks like. 
COVID–19 hit us, and what did we do? 
We not only approved $2.3 trillion and 
then another $500 or so billion dollars, 
and $450 billion that would be multi-
plied in the commercial facilities by 
probably 7 or 8—a $6 trillion relief 
package. What did we do inside that 
package? We targeted small businesses 
to save small businesses, and, by the 
way, we added $1 billion for histori-
cally Black colleges and universities. 
Let me tell you what the biggest 
threat is. The biggest threat is that 
this Republican Party keeps showing 
up and delivering. I have 12 more pages 
to go. It is like being at church with 
my closing. I have 12 more pages of ac-
complishments to talk about. I am not 
going to talk about it. Don’t look re-
lieved. I am not going to talk about it. 
I am just here to state that if we are 
going to be serious about criminal jus-
tice reform—and we passed it with the 
House, Senate, and the White House in 
the hands of Republicans. We passed 
criminal justice reform to make up for 
the Democrat bill—the 1994 crime bill 
that locked up disproportionately Afri-
can-American men. The Republican 
Party passed criminal justice reform 
with all three levers in our hands. 
I am frustrated. I am frustrated be-
cause it is not a competition for the 
best ideas. It is not a competition for 
how to improve the poorest performing 
schools in America in the public edu-
cation system that is consistently in 
Black and Brown communities—that 
your ZIP Code determines the outcome

of your life because you are not going 
to have a good education because we 
will not touch teachers’ unions and we 
will not touch education in the way 
that needs to be touched. 
Governor SCOTT did it before he was 
a Senator. That is one of the reasons 
why I went down there and campaigned 
for him, because he was serious about 
helping poor kids get up and move on. 
Let me just close with this. I don’t 
know what it is going to take to wake 
up an entire nation about the impor-
tance of a duopoly and not a monopoly. 
Look at the results. Look at the re-
sults you are getting. 
By the way, when this bill is gone, 
and next week we are on the NDAA or 
something else, we will forget about 
this. We will move on. People will for-
get about it. And do you know what is 
going to happen? Something bad. And 
we will be right back here talking 
about what could have been done, what 
should have been done, why we must 
act. I am telling you, I had this con-
versation 5 years ago, and I am having 
this conversation right now. We could 
do something right now. 
You know, here is the truth. Detroit, 
Atlanta, 
Minneapolis, Los Angeles, 
Philadelphia, and all of these cities 
could have banned choke holds them-
selves. They could have increased the 
police 
reporting 
themselves. 
They 
could have more data information 
themselves. They could have deescala-
tion training themselves. They could 
have duty to intervene themselves, 
Minneapolis as well. All of these com-
munities have been run by Democrats 
for decades—decades. 
What is the ROI for the poorest peo-
ple in this Nation? And I don’t blame 
them. I blame an elite political class 
with billions of dollars to do whatever 
they want to do. And look at the re-
sults for the poorest, most vulnerable 
people in our Nation. I am willing to 
compete for their vote. Are you? 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I came to 
the floor to hear my colleague from 
South Carolina, with no notes and with 
an open heart and open ears, because I 
knew he would be very disappointed 
that the motion to proceed failed and 
that he would have strong feelings 
about that because of his earnest desire 
to do police reform. I don’t question 
that desire or the desire of any of the 
cosponsors of this bill, just as I hope 
colleagues on the other side don’t ques-
tion the sincerity of Senators BOOKER 
and HARRIS and those who cosponsored 
their bill. But I came with no notes to 
listen to my colleague and then to offer 
a word of explanation. 
I am one of the 44 people who voted 
no. The Senator from South Carolina 
said that those who voted no on the 
motion to proceed didn’t vote on the 
what; we voted no on the who. That is 
a stiff charge. That is a stiff charge. 
What I want to say is this. I voted no 
not on the what and not on the who, 
but I voted no on the how. We tried it 
the wrong way. Let’s try it the right 
way. My colleague from South Carolina 
acts as if this discussion is over. It is 
only over for those who want it to be 
over. We tried it the wrong way. Let’s 
try it the right way. 
What do I mean by that? 
I think everyone in the Chamber 
knows what I mean by this. This is an 
amazingly important topic that is ex-
citing deep and legitimate concerns in 
the streets of every community in this 
country. 
There are two good-faith bills that 
have been introduced dealing with po-
lice reform. I see virtues in both. I 
favor the Democratic bill, but that 
does not mean that I don’t see virtues 
in the Scott bill. 
I have only been in the Senate 7 
years. I am not an expert on procedure, 
as some are who are standing in the 
Chamber right now, but my service 
tells me that there is a clear path to a 
bipartisan police reform bill that will 
do a good job and will speak to an 
America that wants to see leadership 
that is bipartisan. 
It is obvious. These bills are both in 
the province of a Judiciary Committee 
that is chaired by a Republican from 
South 
Carolina, 
LINDSEY
GRAHAM, 
whose ranking member, DIANNE FEIN-
STEIN, has been on that committee for 
a very long time. Why are these bills 
not being taken up in a committee 
with a Republican majority and de-
bated and marked up and reported to 
the floor in a bipartisan way? 
I serve on the Armed Services Com-
mittee. That is what we do every year 
with the NDAA. We introduce it, we let 
members have the ability to offer 
amendments that can be voted on by a 
simple majority vote in committee. We 
get to the end of a process and when no 
one has an amendment left, we then 
have a final bill, and then we vote it 
out overwhelmingly bipartisan. The 
NDAA came out of committee 2 weeks 
ago on a 26-to-2 vote. We will be taking 
it up on the floor. 
I am on the HELP Committee. I have 
a wonderful chair and ranking member 
in Senators ALEXANDER and MURRAY, 
and we tackle tough issues with a com-
mittee that has some big personalities 
on it. I have a couple of them in the 
room with me now. There is great ideo-
logical diversity on that committee, 
but we take up tough issues, and we 
don’t always solve them, but we usu-
ally do when we put our minds to it 
and report something to the floor and 
we do it in a bipartisan way. When it 
comes in a bipartisan way, there is a 
great chance that we get action here 
on the floor. That is the right way to 
do things. It respects the traditions of 
the body, because it is a majority that 
runs the committee, but it allows those 
who have devoted themselves to health 
issues or armed services issues or judi-
ciary issues to offer their thoughts. 
When these bills were introduced, I 
assumed that a committee ably led by 
Senators GRAHAM and FEINSTEIN would 
put these bills together and have a 
markup and let people offer amend-
ments with a 50-percent-vote threshold 
and then report out a bipartisan bill. 
Why would the Judiciary Committee 
not do it? 
I believe the leaders of the com-
mittee wanted to do it, but I believe 
they were told not to do it. They were 
told that we are not going to use the 
committee process on this. We are 
going to force this to a floor vote, a 
snap vote, and then, when it goes down, 
we will say: Democrats killed it. It is 
all over. Move on to the next issue. 
This is only over for anyone who 
wants it to be over. 
I think the vote today says: We are 
not going to do it ‘‘my way or the high-
way.’’ We ought to do it the right 
way—the way we do the NDAA, the 
way we did the FIRST STEP Act. The 
FIRST STEP Act, criminal justice re-
form, 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
working together, in committee and 
then negotiating with Jared Kushner 
and others at the White House—we did 
something good that all can take cred-
it for. 
How about the CARES Act? There is 
a recent example of this. The CARES 
Act was an unusual one. We were under 
an emergency. We were socially distant 
from each other. We couldn’t even be in 
the same room as we were negotiating 
it, and it was in multiple committees’ 
jurisdiction. So it wasn’t as if one com-
mittee was taking it up. But there was 
good-faith, bipartisan negotiation on 
the different pieces of it. 
One day, Leader MCCONNELL called us 
all back to Washington on a Sunday to 
vote—not on the bipartisan negotiated 
bill but on a partisan version. And, 
again, Democrats on this side of the 
aisle said: We are not ready to proceed. 
We are in the middle of bipartisan dis-
cussions. We are not ready to proceed 
to the partisan bill because we are in 
the middle of bipartisan discussions 
that will have the payoff for this coun-
try, and so we voted no—not on the 
what, not on the who. We voted no on 
the how. 
We are not ready to proceed to a par-
tisan, ‘‘my way or the highway’’ bill 
when we are engaged in bipartisan dis-
cussions that can find a solution that 
is good for the country. Guess what 
happened. Three days later, after that 
‘‘no’’ vote, we were here on the floor 
voting yes—voting yes to a bipartisan 
bill that helped individuals and fami-
lies, that created a grant program for 
small businesses, a loan program for 
large businesses, aid to State and local 
governments, aid to hospitals and nurs-
ing homes and healthcare providers. 
We voted no on the ‘‘my way or the 
highway’’ and said: Stay at the table 
with us. Let’s have bipartisan discus-
sions, and we can get to a yes. 
And even as Members of this body 
were being diagnosed with coronavirus 
or exposed to it, we stayed at the table 
until we could get the work done, and 
we did it for the good of the country. 
This discussion is not over unless 
people want it to be over.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3175 
June 24, 2020 
Senator KING and I, on Monday, sent 
a letter to the two leaders and to the 
Judiciary Committee chair and rank-
ing member, and we said: For God’s 
sake, with a nation that is crying out 
for solutions that can show some 
unity, please do with this bill what we 
know will work and what has worked. 
Let the Judiciary Committee take it 
up promptly and let them work and re-
port it to the floor, and we can do this 
bill before the August recess and do it 
in a way where, in committee and on 
the floor, everyone has a chance to par-
ticipate and we can get a win for the 
American public that is critically im-
portant. It is my hope that we will still 
do that. 
The tenor of some of the conversa-
tions is as if this is now over, in the 
rear-view mirror, not to be returned to 
until after November. I don’t accept 
that. I don’t accept that. These bills 
are pending. We have a Judiciary Com-
mittee that can do this work. 
I went to the Judiciary Committee 
this morning to introduce a judicial 
nominee and asked members of the 
committee who were there: If these 
bills were taken up in this committee, 
could you find a bipartisan result? And 
the answer they gave to me was yes. 
I didn’t vote no for the what. I didn’t 
vote no for the who. I voted no for the 
how. I know how we can do this bill, 
and shame on us on a matter of such 
seriousness if we don’t engage in a 
process whose seriousness matches the 
gravity of the moment. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. The Senator from Mary-
land was first. I have 40 seconds to 
comment, but thank you. 
I respect the Senator from Virginia, 
but I would like to note for the 
RECORD, as somebody who spent a lot 
of time in the working group under 
Senator SCOTT’s leadership, that Sen-
ator KAINE repeatedly said it was a 
‘‘my way or the highway’’ approach. I 
just think it is really important for the 
RECORD for us to admit that this is an 
open amendment process that has been 
proposed, and that some of the Demo-
crats who came to some of the meet-
ings to negotiate were frankly stunned 
when Mr. SCOTT went from 5 amend-
ments to 20 amendments, to whatever 
number you want. That is the opposite 
of a ‘‘my way or the highway’’ ap-
proach. That language isn’t true. An 
open amendment process where dozens 
have been offered is not a ‘‘my way or 
the highway’’ approach. 
Mr. KAINE. Would the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. SASSE. Yes. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator from Nebraska is a member of the 
Judiciary Committee, isn’t that right? 
Mr. SASSE. One of the most dysfunc-
tional committees in the Senate—I am. 
Mr. KAINE. When the Senator has 
markups in the Judiciary Committee 
on a bill like the FIRST STEP Act and 
someone, Democrat or Republican, pro-
poses an amendment to mark, isn’t it 
the standard to vote on the amendment 
and if the majority of the committee 
approves, then the amendment is added 
to the bill? 
Mr. SASSE. There are so many dif-
ferent procedures in the Judiciary 
Committee. You defined yourself as a 
rookie who has been here for 7 years. I 
am a rookie to your rookie, and I am 
new on Judiciary. So there are a lot of 
ways. The way you are defining it is 
usually the model, but there is a whole 
bunch of stuff that happens. You asked 
for the question that falls into that, 
but perhaps there is another comment 
that you can make. 
Mr. KAINE. My experience on every 
committee I have been on is that we 
leave it to a markup in the committee 
with a simple majority, not allowing a 
simple majority amendment process in 
committee, but saying ‘‘no, we will 
give you some amendments on the 
floor with a 60-vote threshold’’ is not 
the same thing. It doesn’t respect an 
individual’s ability to try to persuade 
the majority of my colleagues, Demo-
crats and Republicans, that it is a good 
idea or not. That is why this bill was 
not sent to committee but just put on 
the floor. So I don’t view that as fair, 
to respond. 
I get Senator SCOTT, and I appreciate 
him saying that we should have open 
amendments on the floor. But depriv-
ing people the ability to offer open 
amendments in a simple majority—can 
I convince the majority of my col-
leagues in the committee?—that is al-
ready stacking the deck, in my view. 
Mr. SASSE. I thank the Senator for 
his question. I told the Senator from 
Maryland I would get out of his way, 
and I thank him for the time. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Mary-
land is recognized. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, over 
the weekend, I was reflecting on the 
times that our Nation finds itself in 
today. We are witnessing the rebirth of 
a new civil rights movement when it 
comes to reforming our police depart-
ments. 
Americans now know the names of 
George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Freddie 
Gray, and so many others. The current 
protests we have seen throughout the 
Nation and throughout the world are a 
direct result of an incredible leap in 
technology, where individual citizens 
and officers themselves can record 
interactions between police officers 
and members of the community in real 
time. 
But these troubling interactions be-
tween the police and the citizens they 
are sworn to protect and serve that we 
saw on video is not new, but we now 
have the evidence. They just happened 
to be caught, creating stronger legal 
evidence of misconduct and abuse. 
Today, as our Nation experiences yet 
another civil rights movement, this 
time during a pandemic, I want to 
share with my colleagues some words 
of inspiration I often turn to in times 
of trouble. 
First, in the Constitution: ‘‘We the 
people of the United States, in Order to 
form a more perfect Union, establish 
Justice. . . . ’’ That is the first men-
tion in the Constitution. 
Let us think how we in the United 
States can help to establish justice, as 
we are exhorted to do in the Constitu-
tion, which we are sworn to uphold and 
defend. 
The second set of words I would like 
to share with you are from my col-
league and dear friend, the late Elijah 
Cummings, who represented Baltimore 
in the Congress for many years. Rep-
resentative Cummings gave the eulogy 
for Freddie Gray in 2015, who died after 
being arrested and taken into police 
custody. During Freddie Gray’s church 
service, Elijah closed with a quote 
from the Old Testament Book of Amos: 
I want justice—oceans of it. I want fair-
ness—rivers of it. That is what I want. That 
is all I want. 
The third story I want to share with 
my colleagues is the inspiration I felt 
from reading Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.’s ‘‘Letter from a Birmingham Jail,’’ 
in April of 1963. Dr. King wrote: 
We know through painful experiences that 
freedom is never voluntarily given by the op-
pressor; it must be demanded by the op-
pressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a 
direct action campaign that was ‘‘well- 
timed,’’ [in the view] of those who have not 
suffered unduly from the disease of segrega-
tion. For years now I have heard the words 
‘‘Wait!’’ It rings in the ear of every Negro 
with a piercing familiarity. This ‘‘Wait’’ has 
almost always meant ‘‘Never.’’ 
We must come to see, with one of our dis-
tinguished jurors, that ‘‘justice too long de-
layed is justice denied.’’ 
We have waited for more than 340 years for 
our constitutional and God given rights . . . 
Perhaps it is easy for those who have never 
felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, 
‘‘Wait.’’ But when you have seen vicious 
mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will 
and drown your sisters and brothers at 
whim; when you have seen hate filled police-
men curse, kick and even kill your black 
brothers and sisters; when you see the vast 
majority of your twenty million Negro 
brothers smothering in an airtight cage of 
poverty in the midst of affluent society . . . 
when you have to concoct an answer for a 
five year old son who is asking: ‘‘Daddy, why 
do white people treat colored people so 
mean?’’ . . . when you are harried by day and 
haunted by night by the fact that you are a 
Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, 
never quite knowing what to expect next, 
and are plagued with inner fears and outer 
resentments; when you are forever fighting a 
degenerating sense of ‘‘nobodiness’’—then 
you will understand why we find it difficult 
to wait. There comes a time when the cup of 
endurance runs over, and men are no longer 
willing to be plunged into the abyss of de-
spair. I hope, sirs, you understand our legiti-
mate and unavoidable impatience. 
So this weekend, as I was thinking 
about our charge to establish justice in 
the Constitution and the pleas from 
Elijah Cummings and Dr. King, I con-
templated where we are today. We are 
at a point in our Nation that we need 
to make transformational change when 
it comes to our police officers and their

fundamental relationships with our 
communities, in particular the Afri-
can-American community and other 
communities of color. We can no longer 
wait. We must make bold changes now. 
I agree with Leader SCHUMER
and 
Senators BOOKER and HARRIS, who are 
the authors of the Justice in Policing 
Act. My concern is that the legislation 
authored by Senator SCOTT, the JUS-
TICE Act, falls dangerously short for 
what we need for comprehensive, effec-
tive, and transformational police re-
form that our country and the Amer-
ican people are demanding. 
I, 
therefore, 
hope 
that 
Leader 
MCCONNELL will negotiate with Leader 
SCHUMER so we can work on a bipar-
tisan bill and establish a constructive 
starting point on policing reform. I lis-
tened to the debate with Senator SCOTT 
and Senator KAINE, and I have seen 
this before. When we bring a partisan 
bill to the floor where there is no pre-
arranged opportunity to offer the types 
of amendments with simple majority 
votes so the rule of the Senate can pre-
vail and when you start from a point 
that cannot lead to successful conclu-
sion, you shouldn’t start. You should 
go back to negotiate a truly bipartisan 
bill. 
We should use the model of the 
CARES Act legislation that was signed 
into law in response to the COVID–19 
pandemic. That was a bipartisan bill 
that was brought to the floor. Let me 
just highlight a few of my concerns 
with the JUSTICE Act. 
This legislation does not contain any 
mechanisms to hold law enforcement 
officers accountable in court for their 
misconduct. For example, it makes no 
changes in the law when it comes to 
qualified immunity or criminal intent 
standards for law enforcement. Current 
legal standards have allowed law en-
forcement officers regularly to evade 
criminal liability for excessive use of 
force and have shielded officers from li-
ability, even when they violate citi-
zens’ constitutional rights. 
The JUSTICE Act does not imple-
ment a public national misconduct reg-
istry necessary to ensure communities 
have information necessary to hold 
their law enforcement officers account-
able. The JUSTICE Act fails to estab-
lish a collection of all use-of-force 
data, data related to religious and ra-
cial profiling, and it does nothing to 
end harmful policing practices like ra-
cial and religious profiling. 
By contrast, the Justice in Policing 
Act authored by Senators BOOKER and 
HARRIS does contain legislation I au-
thored, the End Racial and Religious 
Profiling Act. Why do we need that? 
Studies have shown that Blacks are 3.6 
times more likely to be arrested for 
selling drugs, despite the fact that 
Whites are more likely to sell drugs. 
Studies show that Blacks are 2.5 times 
more likely to be arrested for pos-
sessing drugs, despite using drugs at 
the same rate as Whites. 
This is just wrong, and Congress and 
even President Trump recognized this 
when we made some modest improve-
ments to the FIRST STEP Act. That 
was a bipartisan bill and started as a 
bipartisan bill, and we were able to get 
it enacted. The End Racial and Reli-
gious Profiling Act is designed to en-
force the constitutional rights to equal 
protections under law by eliminating 
racial- and religious-based discrimina-
tory profiling at all levels of law en-
forcement by changing the policies and 
procedures. 
It allows police to focus their work 
more accurately, rather than wasting 
resources on blanket stereotypes. It re-
quires enhanced data collection for the 
Department of Justice to track and 
monitor discriminatory profiling. It 
holds State and local enforcement 
agencies accountable by conditioning 
Federal funds on the adoption of poli-
cies and best practices to combat 
profiling by officers. It eliminates, 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
discriminatory 
profiling. It is in the Booker-Harris 
bill. It is not in the Scott bill. 
The underlying JUSTICE Act does 
not include any real national standards 
for law enforcement. By contrast, the 
Justice in Policing Act contains legis-
lation I authored, the Law Enforce-
ment Trust and Integrity Act, which 
takes a comprehensive approach on 
how local police organizations can 
adopt performance-based standards to 
ensure that instances of misconduct 
will be minimized through training and 
oversight. That legislation takes steps 
to mitigate police violence by desig-
nating resources for community devel-
opment and the transformation of pub-
lic safety practices. 
In Baltimore, we have ongoing Fed-
eral partnerships with city law enforce-
ment and the Federal Justice Depart-
ment following the tragic death of 
Freddie Gray, Jr. This is an example of 
continued efforts to rebuild trust be-
tween communities and police and en-
courages the establishment of more ef-
fective police models. 
The legislation I described provides 
public safety innovation grants to help 
communities reimagine and develop 
concrete, just, and equitable public 
safety approaches. This is in the Book-
er-Harris bill. It is not in the Scott 
bill. The JUSTICE Act does not ade-
quately address the issue of no-knock 
warrants in drug cases, nor does it ade-
quately address the use of choke holds. 
Finally, the legislation does not ad-
dress the issue of establishing a na-
tional use-of-force standard. 
By contrast, the Justice in Policing 
Act changes the use-of-force standards 
for officers so that deadly force be used 
only as a last resort, while requiring 
officers to employ deescalation tech-
niques. Let me bring to my colleagues’ 
attention a letter dated June 23, 2020, 
from the Leadership Conference on 
Civil and Human Rights. 
In the letter, the Leadership Con-
ferences writes to Congress: 
We write to express our strong opposition 
to S. 3985, the . . . [JUSTICE Act]. The JUS-
TICE Act is an inadequate response to the 
decades of pain, hardship, and devastation 
that Black people have and continue to en-
dure as a result of systemic racism and lax 
policies that fail to hold police accountable 
for misconduct. 
The letter goes on to say: 
Abusive policing practices, coupled with 
devastating state-sanctioned violence, have 
exacted systemic brutality and fatality upon 
Black people since our nation’s founding. Po-
lice have shot and killed more than 1,000 peo-
ple in the United States over the past year, 
and Black people are disproportionately 
more likely than white people to be killed by 
police. The current protests in our cities are 
a response not only to the unjust policing of 
Black people, but also calls for action to 
public officials to enact bold, comprehensive, 
and structural change. 
The letter concludes. 
. . . . Passing watered-down legislation 
that fails to remedy the actual harms result-
ing in the loss of life is a moral statement 
that is inconsistent with a genuine belief 
that black lives matter. Anything less than 
full support for comprehensive legislation 
that holds police accountable is inexcusable. 
Let me close my remarks once again 
by sharing some words from Dr. King, 
from the March on Washington in 1963. 
In his famous speech at the foot of the 
Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall 
in Washington, DC, Dr. King said: 
In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s cap-
ital to cash a check. When the architects of 
our Republic wrote the magnificent words of 
the Constitution and Declaration of Inde-
pendence, they were signing a promissory 
note to which every American was to fall 
heir. This note was a promise that all men— 
yes, black men as well as white men—would 
be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is ob-
vious today that America has defaulted on 
this promissory note insofar as her citizens 
of color are concerned . . . But we refused to 
believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. 
We refuse to believe that there are insuffi-
cient funds in the great vaults of oppor-
tunity of this nation. So we’ve come to cash 
this check, a check that will give us upon de-
mand the riches of freedom and the security 
of justice. 
Dr. King continued by saying: 
We have also come to this hollowed spot to 
remind America of the fierce urgency of now. 
This is no time to engage in the luxury of 
cooling off or take the tranquilizing drug of 
gradualism. Now is the time to make real 
the promise of democracy . . . Now is the 
time to lift our nation from the quicksands 
of racial injustice to the solid rock of broth-
erhood . . . Now is the time to make justice 
a reality for all God’s children. It would be 
fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency 
of the moment . . . 
The House of Representatives is 
scheduled to pass their version of the 
Justice in Policing Act on Thursday. 
Let us take up meaningful legislation 
in the Senate as the base bill nego-
tiated between Democrats and Repub-
licans. Let us rise to the occasion and 
make the Founders of this Nation 
proud. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

June 24, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, the 
murder of George Floyd captured the 
attention and the emotions of the en-
tire world. In the weeks that have fol-
lowed, folks around the world have 
been crying out for a change, an end to 
racial inequality and the beginning of a 
new era of justice, understanding, and 
healing. While sometimes uncomfort-
able, this conversation is much needed, 
and, in my opinion, it is long overdue. 
It should not have taken the loss of a 
life for us to begin to talk and listen 
and to learn. 
I grew up in a predominantly White 
community, but as a young woman, I 
was truly blessed to live, learn, and 
work in communities that were rich in 
diversity. It is difficult to understand 
the unfairness someone faces due to 
their skin color, but we can make time 
to listen. I did this last week when I 
sat down with our own Senate Chap-
lain, Barry Black. 
For those who do not know him, 
Chaplain Black is a remarkable and in-
spiring person. After serving over 27 
years in the U.S. Navy, he now serves 
as a spiritual guide for Senators and 
opens our proceedings every day with a 
thoughtful prayer. One of my favorite 
things he told me was about a lesson 
his mother had taught him. She told 
him that God gave us two ears, two 
eyes, but only one mouth—and we 
should use them proportionately. 
I believe the United States is, by far, 
the greatest country in the world, but 
that does not mean that we don’t have 
past and current issues that we need to 
address. Let’s be frank, it was not a 
single, isolated event—the murder of 
Mr. Floyd—that incited the raw emo-
tions that are still burning weeks 
later. 
In Iowa, Governor Kim Reynolds 
signed a historic police reform bill, 
which will add additional account-
ability for law enforcement. This will 
benefit both the community and the 
police. Here is what is remarkable 
about 
this 
new 
law: 
Partisanship 
wasn’t a factor. 
Republican house majority leader 
Matt Windschitl and Democratic rep-
resentative Ako Abdul-Samad, two of 
the extraordinary leaders that ushered 
this bill through the house and through 
our legislature, spoke with me this 
morning, and both of them said that, 
while they don’t each view this as a 
perfect bill, it was more than cosmetic. 
It had real meaning and depth, and it 
was a first step. 
I agreed with them because any jour-
ney starts with a single step, a mean-
ingful step. The bill passed the Iowa 
House by a vote—again, with these two 
extraordinary leaders—by a vote of 98– 
0, unanimous. It then went to the Iowa 
Senate, and it passed in the Iowa Sen-
ate 49–0. Partisanship wasn’t a factor. 
The only thing that mattered was 
doing the right thing. 
Not a single dissenting vote was cast, 
and it even had the endorsement of the 
Iowa Police Officers Association. We 
are only going to improve as a nation 
if we come together and make everyone 
a part of the solution. We can do that. 
Iowa put politics aside, and they got it 
done. I wish we could see more of Iowa 
in this Chamber. 
We need both sides of the aisle to 
unite and to pass Senator TIM SCOTT’s 
JUSTICE Act. The JUSTICE Act offers 
real solutions to police reform by in-
creasing oversight, strengthening inci-
dent report requirements, and ensuring 
the correct use of body cameras. It in-
cludes an issue that I have been work-
ing to address: sexual misconduct with-
in our law enforcement. 
The JUSTICE Act is simply a com-
monsense approach to effective police 
reform. The bill includes a number of 
bipartisan provisions, including the 
antilynching proposal put forward by 
Senators JOHN
CORNYN
and KAMALA 
HARRIS. It is heartbreaking that the 
bill to address these issues was blocked 
by Senate Democrats. 
The Senate exists so we can debate 
these issues in a civil manner and 
reach a consensus so they aren’t re-
solved in the streets. We can’t do that 
if the other side chooses to shut down 
meaningful debate or give in to radical 
ideas like defunding the police, which 
won’t solve the problem of inequality 
or end violence. 
I ask my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle: Are you willing to come to 
the table? Are you willing to accept 
that amendment process? Are you will-
ing to take the first step in our jour-
ney? Will you put politics aside and 
help us enact reforms to ensure the 
safety of our communities? 
Our Nation’s journey toward becom-
ing a more perfect union and securing 
the blessings of liberty for all Ameri-
cans has taken a long and bumpy road, 
and we still have a lot farther to go. It 
starts with that one step. But at this 
moment, the country and the world are 
demanding we pick up the stride. Let’s 
follow Iowa’s lead. Let’s come together 
and take meaningful action. 
To be clear, the passage of a single 
bill is not going to suddenly reverse 
centuries of injustice. Passing laws are 
a simple part. If we really want to 
change behavior, we need to commit 
ourselves to changing our hearts. The 
best way that we can personally com-
memorate the life of George Floyd and 
the many others before him who lost 
their lives or suffered injustice is to 
open our own hearts. 
Chaplain Black summed up the solu-
tion best when he quoted to me Mark 
12:31: ‘‘Love your neighbor as your-
self.’’ It is both that simple and that 
challenging. 
So I am asking all of us in this body 
to be more like Iowa. Let’s find a solu-
tion. Let’s take that first step and 
begin our journey together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent 
that the order for the quorum call be 
rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I heard 
your comments earlier today—and I 
couldn’t agree more—on the impor-
tance of us dealing with the issues that 
were on the floor today that we failed 
to deal with. I heard our good friend 
Senator SCOTT’s response to the way 
his hard work was looked at and, 
frankly, ignored. 
When the Congress stops resembling 
an honest and open discussion of the 
issues, I think it gives us a lot to be 
concerned about. The solution should 
be the goal. When Members of Congress 
are more interested in a bill that they 
believe to be perfect rather than seri-
ously engaging in a debate, it raises a 
lot of concerns about how we protect 
liberty and how we do our constitu-
tional duty. 
I have been in the Congress for a 
while, as some of my friends are more 
than eager to point out, and I have 
never voted for a perfect bill—ever. I 
have introduced a couple of perfect 
bills, but I have never voted for a per-
fect bill. I have never voted for a bill 
that couldn’t be improved. 
Our good friend TIM SCOTT said some-
thing the other day that struck me as 
a truism. He said: I think most Ameri-
cans are tired of Republicans and 
Democrats talking about Republicans 
and Democrats. Most Americans, as 
Senator SCOTT’s point was made, want 
us to solve problems. They want us to 
come up not with the best answer pos-
sible; they want us to come up with the 
best possible answer. 
What is the difference between the 
best answer possible and the best pos-
sible answer? The difference is figuring 
out when you have gotten done as 
much as you can get done and you de-
cide that, in this process, you want to 
accept that and come back at a later 
time and see if you can do a little bet-
ter. 
They don’t want us to reject a prom-
ising solution just because someone 
from the other party said it first. They 
don’t want us to reject a promising so-
lution just because it doesn’t solve ev-
erything. 
Nothing around here happens as fast 
as we would like it to. Debate, discus-
sion, and compromise all take time. 
Remember, the Constitution was put 
together by people who didn’t trust 
government. They didn’t want to make 
it easy for government to do things, 
and they didn’t. 
One of the great successes of all time 
was the success of making it hard for 
our government to do things. It is hard 
to explain in other countries where 
they 
have 
parliamentary 
systems 
where, if the leader doesn’t get what 
the leader wants, the government col-
lapses. That is not the way this govern-
ment is designed at all. It is designed 
to take some time, but you have to be 
willing to take the time. It is designed

to reach compromise, but you have to 
be willing to reach compromise. 
We think our job should be to, again, 
come up with the best solution we can 
come up with and try to do the job that 
we are sent here to do, trying not to 
wait and say: Well, we are too close to 
an election. Apparently we are too 
close to an election all the time now. 
We never want to give away anything 
that could be a political issue because 
it is better—maybe in some minds—not 
to solve it than it is to solve it. 
Today’s disappointing vote doesn’t 
have to be final. The majority leader 
changed his vote at the very end. It 
was 56 to 44—3 Democrats and all of the 
Republicans wanting to move forward, 
but it takes 60 votes here to move for-
ward. 
By the way, it also takes 60 votes to 
get off the bill to have a vote. There 
was nothing to be lost by seeing if we 
couldn’t make Senator SCOTT’s bill 
better. In fact, I understand from his 
speech earlier that he agreed to 20 
amendments that had the possibility to 
do that. That is what we are supposed 
to do. We are here to vote. We are here 
to make decisions. We are here to move 
forward or to decide we don’t want to 
move forward. There are times when a 
decision is that this is not the right so-
lution to this problem. That was not 
what we were dealing with today. 
Our colleagues in the House planned 
their own legislation. There was that 
moment of hope when the Speaker of 
the House said she looked forward to 
taking their product—their bill—to 
conference. Well, you only get to take 
a bill to conference if there is a con-
ference, and you only get to take a bill 
to conference if we pass a bill and the 
House passes a bill. 
By the way, if they are exactly the 
same bill, there is no reason to go to 
conference. That bill goes to the Presi-
dent. 
We pass a bill, the House passes a 
bill, we go to conference, and then we 
come back. And 44 of our colleagues 
were unwilling to go through that 
process. 
On a bill like this, you get a lot of 
votes. You get the vote to go to the de-
bate. You get the vote to go to the 
vote. You get the vote to pass the Sen-
ate bill. It has been, actually, a while 
since I heard somebody say what used 
to be said often: I am voting for this 
bill. I don’t think it is where it should 
be yet, but I look forward to voting for 
a better process coming out of con-
ference. 
You used to hear that all the time: I 
am voting for this bill so we can get to 
conference, and in conference I am 
going to do everything I can to work to 
make it better. That is how the process 
works. 
This ‘‘take it or leave it,’’ nobody 
shows up—our friends at the House 
show up one day to vote on a bill that 
God knows who decided what would be 
in that bill, and that is the bill we ei-
ther accept or reject. What a foolish 
way to do business. What an unsatis-
factory way to fail to debate the issues 
that people sent us here to decide. 
But, again, the House will pass a bill 
this week, and unless we reconsider 
this decision, that will be the end of it. 
That will be the end of it. The House 
has passed a bill. We are not going to 
take up the House bill. There is no Sen-
ate product to go to conference. That is 
the end of it. 
It is an issue that we need to find a 
solution to. It was an issue we needed 
to find a solution to after what hap-
pened in St. Louis in 2014. It is an issue 
we have needed to find a solution to. 
The dates seem to keep getting closer, 
to where this year three things hap-
pened in a row—maybe more than 
three—that shouldn’t have happened, 
and things have happened since those 
three things that shouldn’t have hap-
pened. 
We need to lead on this issue. We 
need to find a way to make a successful 
conclusion to the best we can do. The 
best we can do today doesn’t mean that 
is the best we can ever do; it just 
means, when you have something that 
you are agreeing with—and this isn’t 
even a bill where—Senator SCOTT’s 
bill—I didn’t hear Democrats say: I 
agree with 80 percent of what is in the 
bill. They were more likely to say: 80 
percent of what I want to do is in the 
bill. 
Take 80 percent of what you want to 
do to conference and hope it comes 
back with 90 percent of what you want 
to do or 96 percent of what you want to 
do. But if you don’t trust the process, 
the process cannot produce a result. 
People are tired of us failing to do 
our job. We need to vote. We need to 
have amendments. We need to have 
bills on the floor on issues like this 
that the American people are in the 
streets of America saying: Solve this 
problem. 
You can’t solve this problem by turn-
ing your back on it. You can’t solve 
this problem by saying: If I don’t get 
this exactly the way I want it, I would 
rather not have anything. I will tell 
you what that gets you. That gets you 
nothing. In a democracy, that does not 
work. If you are getting your way all 
the time—at home, at church, at 
school, at work, in the Congress—there 
is something wrong with you. There is 
something wrong with you. Nobody 
gets their way all the time. Com-
promise is the essence of democracy, 
but you have to be willing to go to the 
place where compromise happens. On 
this bill, that would have been at con-
ference, to see if we can’t come closer 
to a bill that everybody believes is the 
best we can do. 
I think Senator SCOTT did a great job 
with his bill. I think Senator SCOTT 
thinks his bill could be better. But his 
bill is not the House bill, and the House 
bill is not going to be the final bill ei-
ther. 
What a mistake to walk away from 
the chance to solve a problem. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
just finished up a vote on the Senate 
floor where we fell four votes short of 
opening debate on a bill to deal with 
police reform—four votes short. We 
were four votes short of opening debate 
to discuss it. 
Every single Republican voted for 
this—and a handful of Democrats. But 
the vast majority of Democrats actu-
ally said: No, we don’t want to debate 
this bill. We will only debate the Pelosi 
bill when it comes out of the House. 
Well, that is absurd. That didn’t hap-
pen, I can assure you, when Speaker 
Boehner was the leader of the House, 
that the Senate said ‘‘I will tell you 
what, we are going to wait and see 
whatever Speaker Boehner sends over 
to Harry Reid’’ and Harry Reid would 
say ‘‘Oh, yes, please. We will take up 
whatever the Boehner bill is.’’ That 
was never done, and they know that. 
This is such an odd, peculiar season 
in our country politically and a painful 
season in our country culturally and 
practically. 
Our hope was to have a real debate 
on a real bill. I was part of the team in 
writing this bill. This bill was a gen-
uine push to reform how we do police 
work and to increase accountability 
and transparency across the country. 
The bill that we just needed four 
Democrats to join—just four Demo-
crats to join—to be able to open it up 
for debate would have banned choke 
holds across the country. 
It would have required the reporting 
of all serious bodily injury or death in 
police custody from everywhere in the 
country, to start tracking all of this. 
It would have gathered information 
on no-knock warrants all around the 
country to start tracking this informa-
tion to see if they are being abused. 
It would have put more body cameras 
on the street. This bill that we just 
needed four Democrats to join us on— 
just four—would have put $150 million 
more in body-worn cameras on the 
street. It wouldn’t have just put those 
body cameras on the street; it would 
have also put in new requirements to 
make sure they stay on, which has 
been an issue. 
This bill that we just needed four 
Democrats to join us on, just so we 
could debate it and discuss it and 
amend it, would have had a whole new 
system tracking complaints and dis-
cipline actions. It would have pulled 
together records for law enforcement 
officers to make sure that they would 
have had those records—their com-
mendations and their discipline—travel 
to the next department with them. So 
before an officer leaves one department 
and goes to the next, all the records 
are made available to the next depart-
ment so that we don’t have a bad apple 
moving from department to depart-
ment. 
This bill that we just needed four 
Democrats to join on with us—any 
four—just so we could open it up and 
debate it and amend it would have 
changed the system on a duty to inter-
vene, putting new obligations, new

training, and new requirements on an 
officer who is watching another officer 
do something they know is wrong to 
intervene in that process and to stop 
it. 
It would have a national commission 
to pull folks together to get the best 
ideas from around the country, to 
gather the best practices that have 
happened. 
There is also a new piece that is in 
this—it is not in the Pelosi bill; it is 
only in this bill—that deals with giving 
a false report if you are a police officer, 
because at times we will have a police 
officer where—when there is serious 
bodily injury or death, their written 
record doesn’t match the reality of 
what really happened, and it is not just 
that they misremembered; they inten-
tionally turned in a false report. This 
bill that we wanted to just debate 
today would have allowed us to be able 
to add additional penalties onto that, 
to make sure someone receives the due 
penalty if they try to lie on forms. 
This bill would have dealt with men-
tal health. 
This bill would have dealt with dees-
calation training. This bill was de-
signed to help get additional training. 
This bill has a section on it using the 
Museum of African American History 
to design a curriculum that we could 
put out to every department around 
the country on the history of race and 
law enforcement. It is modeled after 
what was done with the Holocaust Mu-
seum to deal with anti-Semitism. That 
is what this bill was designed to do. We 
just needed four Democrats to join us. 
Instead, they dug in, did press releases, 
and said: That bill is terrible. It is 
awful. It has no teeth in it. That bill is 
unsalvageable. 
I would ask any American listening 
to me and anyone in this room: Is there 
one of those ideas you don’t like? 
Then the conversation was, well, we 
are not going to have an open enough 
process. 
Senator SCOTT, who is our point ne-
gotiator in this, sat down with Demo-
cratic leadership and said: How about 
20 amendments on this bill? If you 
want to bring something up to amend 
it, change, it, great. 
They said no. Their desire is only 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill or nothing. I 
think that is exceptionally sad. 
We have been through this journey so 
many times where we will see a Black 
man be killed, we will all watch the 
footage, the whole country rises up, 
and Congress starts debating, and then 
it stops. It stops because of silly stuff 
like this where people dig in and say: If 
you don’t do it entirely our way, then 
we are not going to do it at all. It is 
not about solving the problem; it is 
just about prolonging a problem so you 
can make it a political issue when fam-
ilies out there want this solved. 
All of those things I listed are all out 
there. 
There are two things I have heard. 
We are not going to take up your bill. 
We are not going to debate it. We are 
not going to discuss it. We are going to 
block it from coming to the floor— 
which is what happened today. The two 
issues I heard are, you know what, I 
really want us to go to committee. I 
want a committee to look at this, take 
some time, go through this. 
That is a fascinating argument, and I 
wish it was true. Two weeks ago, the 
discussion was ‘‘We need to get on this 
as quickly as possible’’—until we actu-
ally put out a legitimate bill, and then 
my Democratic colleagues said, ‘‘Well, 
there is a problem with how you are 
putting it out. We are going to debate 
it on the floor. I would rather debate it 
in committee and then have the floor 
bring it but not debate it on the floor. 
I don’t want to debate it out here. Let’s 
debate it over there.’’ 
No one is buying that argument. No 
one is buying that. If you can put 20 
amendments on this, that is what 
would happen in a committee. Let’s 
bring it. Let’s talk about it. Everyone 
sees what that is. Shuffling bills off to 
committee is about delaying and stall-
ing and ‘‘Let’s delay this,’’ because 
they know we won’t get it this week, 
and they will delay it, and then it will 
be after the Fourth of July. When we 
come back from the Fourth of July, we 
have the coronavirus bills, as they 
know, and we have the appropriations 
bills, as they know. So it is like, OK, so 
it will not happen there. So then there 
is the August gap, and then it will 
move to September. What they are try-
ing to do is get it closer and closer to 
the election and then make it a big 
election issue, saying: Those crazy Re-
publicans will not resolve this. Get it 
close to the election and make it an 
election issue. 
Hello—why don’t we just solve this 
instead 
of 
dragging 
the 
country 
through something we all know key 
ways to be able to solve? 
Two issues we know of—one is a 
purely political issue: stall, delay, try 
to get this closer to the election, and 
then divide the country. The second 
one deals with an issue on whether po-
lice officers should face not only crimi-
nal liability, they should face civil li-
ability as well. 
You hear this get kicked around all 
the time with all different kinds of 
terms. Speaker PELOSI’s bill says: Not 
only put that police officer in prison, 
which they deserve—if they murder 
someone, commit a crime, a police offi-
cer is as liable for the law as everyone 
else is, and if they are not, they should 
be, and we should fix that. Speaker 
PELOSI’s bill says: Not only put them 
in prison but also civilly take their 
home and their car and their pension 
away from their family. Make sure we 
leave them destitute and their family 
destitute, as well as put them in pris-
on. That is what their bill is all about. 
It is the reason why so many police 
officers are so frustrated and furious 
with the bill they adamantly want to 
put on the floor, because they are say-
ing that if they did something wrong, 
they should face the consequences for 
it, but don’t punish their family. 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill says: No, the 
police officers should be in prison, and 
their families should have their home 
taken away from them and their police 
pension taken away from them and ev-
erything else. 
Do you know what we have talked 
about? We talked about a police officer 
facing criminal penalties, as they do 
now, as they should. If there is a civil 
case, why don’t we bring it against the 
department that didn’t train their offi-
cer, that didn’t supervise that officer? 
Instead of attacking an officer’s fam-
ily, why don’t we hold people account-
able to actually supervise people better 
and push the city and the department 
to do the right thing: to train and to 
equip people. If someone is a problem, 
don’t leave them out there on the 
street with 18 discipline records; take 
them off the street. If you don’t, the 
whole city is going to be held to ac-
count for it. That is trying to end this. 
That is trying to push toward more su-
pervision, not just trying to be puni-
tive. 
Those are the two differences that I 
can pick up: political and civil. Other-
wise, a lot of what I mentioned that is 
in our bill is in their bill as well. 
TIM SCOTT made a very simple state-
ment: Why don’t we put this on the 
floor? Why don’t we actually debate 
the differences that we have? Why 
don’t we have a vote, and then why 
don’t we finish this? 
Leader MCCONNELL
dedicated this 
week and next week to this bill on po-
lice reform to give 2 weeks to do all 
kinds of amendments, all kinds of de-
bate, but instead, the conversation was 
‘‘No, don’t want to do that; it is Speak-
er PELOSI’s bill or nothing’’ or ‘‘Let’s 
just slow the whole thing down and 
send it to committee and delay, delay, 
delay this.’’ 
Why don’t we deal with this right 
now? There are 2 weeks that have been 
set aside to do it. There is plenty of 
time for amendments. Why not do that 
instead of just blocking the bill? 
I don’t know a lot of folks who say to 
me: I really don’t want there to be 
more body cameras on the street. I 
don’t want any more oversight on law 
enforcement when they turn in a false 
report or when they turn off their body 
camera. 
I don’t run into a lot of people who 
say: I want to just go ahead and leave 
the system the way it is. 
We really don’t know what is hap-
pening in a police department when 
there is bodily injury and harm. 
I meet a lot of people who say: Those 
things make sense to me. Why don’t we 
do it? 
Unfortunately, that is my same ques-
tion today standing on the floor of the 
Senate: Why don’t we do it? 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague from Oklahoma, 
Senator LANKFORD, for his dedication 
to this issue and his very substantive 
output.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3180 
June 24, 2020 
I was privileged to serve on the 
minigroup that put a lot of work into 
this under Senator SCOTT’s very able 
leadership. I am thankful for the way 
Senator LANKFORD always approaches 
issues, not disparaging motives but al-
ways looking at ways to improve and 
make this world a better place because 
that is what this is about. 
I have been listening to a lot of the 
arguments, a lot of the discussion, and 
I am saying to myself: If somebody 
watching this from afar—from Okla-
homa or from West Virginia or from 
Vermont—I am thinking to myself, 
what is all this talk about 60 votes and 
cloture and all this? They are not fo-
cused on that. All they know is that we 
failed—this failed. 
This was an opportunity that we 
should have grasped. We had a chance 
to discuss the need for police reform 
and to look at the very serious issues 
of racial inequalities. I am exceedingly 
disappointed. I thought yesterday—no, 
actually Monday, I thought, good, we 
are going to get on this bill. We are 
going to have a healthy debate and 
amendments. We are going to be in 
front of the American people, giving 
our different opinions. We are going to 
vote up or down, and we are actually 
going to have a product here that is ac-
tually going to help. But it derailed. It 
derailed badly. I am very disappointed 
by that, as I think everybody in this 
country should be. 
Those who are protesting, those who 
are deeply hurt by what they have 
seen—they don’t care about cloture 
and 60 votes and who gets the political 
point and who is going to be able to 
drag this to the election. They care 
about getting something done on a 
deeply emotional issue. 
We know that every American is en-
titled to equal protection under the 
law. We also know there are a lot of 
good police officers in this country— 
many, the vast majority. It is clear, 
though, that we have a real need to im-
prove our law enforcement so that 
every American can have the con-
fidence that officers are there to serve 
them equally. 
We should provide better resources to 
train police on not just deescalation 
but use of force and intervention, all of 
the issues that we saw come forward in 
the horrifying death of George Floyd. 
We should provide more body cam-
eras. We wouldn’t have known about 
George Floyd had there not been a 
camera. I don’t believe there was a 
camera on the officer; it was a bystand-
er’s camera. But cameras can be so in-
credibly useful to protect the rights of 
the people who are confronted and to 
protect the rights of the police. So we 
need to make sure that those are not 
only provided and there for our law en-
forcement but that they are turned on. 
As we saw in Louisville, they were not 
turned on. 
We should make sure that bad police 
officers can’t get passed from depart-
ment to department and that their dis-
ciplinary 
actions 
and 
employment 
records are there, kept either locally 
or—the Pelosi bill says kept at the 
State; the President says kept at the 
Federal—anyway, in any event, kept 
for the transparency we need. 
We should eliminate the use of choke 
holds by officers unless the officer is in 
a situation where he can’t get out of it, 
but quite frankly, I am for banning 
them in any circumstance. 
Those statements are really not very 
controversial, 
and 
most 
Americans 
really agree with them. How do we 
know that? Both the bill introduced by 
Senator SCOTT and cosponsored by 47 
Republican Senators and the bill intro-
duced by Senator BOOKER
and sup-
ported by many Democrats included 
these provisions in each one of their 
bills. 
We have a nonpartisan Congressional 
Research Service that we rely on for 
nonpartisan advice. The quotes from 
their report in comparing both bills: 
Both bills seek to establish best prac-
tices for law enforcement officers and 
train officers in areas on the use of 
force and racial bias. Both bills would 
seek to increase the use of body cam-
eras worn by State and local law en-
forcement—both bills. Both bills would 
contain provisions designed to enhance 
transparency concerning records of 
misconduct by law enforcement offi-
cers—both bills. Both bills include pro-
visions designed to limit the use of 
choke holds by Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement—although the 
two statutes do differ in the breadth 
and approach. What happens when we 
differ with the House? We go to con-
ference, and we work out our dif-
ferences. But we are not having that 
chance today. 
Given these areas of common ground, 
it should have been easy for us to come 
together and to pass that motion to 
begin the debate on the Senate floor. 
That is what we are supposed to do. 
There are a few major differences in 
the bill, and this is where I think the 
American people would have really 
tuned in to the debate. We know that 
there is a difference on qualified immu-
nity. Let’s have a debate. Let’s have a 
debate. 
Had we moved forward, I think we 
could have ended up with a bipartisan 
bill that could pass both the House and 
the Senate and signed into law. As we 
are now, do you know what we have, as 
Senator SCOTT said in the speech he 
gave about an hour ago? Nothing. We 
have nothing. We have people on the 
streets of every town in America beg-
ging us to do something positive to 
help the situation, and today, crick-
ets—nothing—because we couldn’t get 
cooperation. 
It 
would 
have 
made 
significant 
progress. I heard Senator SCOTT say— 
and I didn’t realize this until I heard 
him say it on the Senate floor—20 
amendments and a managers’ amend-
ment he offered in conversations with 
the other side, and again, no—nothing. 
We don’t want that. 
We don’t have the best record on 
showing the American people that we 
can work together and get things done, 
but, boy, we could have shown them 
that today. We could have shown them 
that the rest of the week as we debate 
those issues. I can guarantee you, on 
some of the sticky issues, we would 
have had great agreement. Maybe we 
all wouldn’t have agreed on it, but 
some of each from each part of our 
party and each part of the country 
would have agreed on those issues and 
formulated better, smarter, more effi-
cient legislation. We could have dem-
onstrated that we are united in support 
of the civil rights of all Americans and 
in support of the men and women in 
law enforcement. Instead, partisanship 
was allowed to carry the day. 
It should be clear, because I think it 
should be to the American people, that 
this motion—the other side says, ‘‘We 
don’t have a seat at the table’’—would 
have provided the world stage for their 
seat at the table to debate this issue. 
We need 60 votes to continue, and 
here I am talking about the technical-
ities of how to get it done. But there 
would have been an enormous amend-
ment process that probably would have 
been quite lengthy and very beneficial. 
I am very disappointed. I am dis-
appointed to tell the American people 
that we are listening to you, but, you 
know, maybe it is not in our own polit-
ical benefit to cooperate to move for-
ward, so let’s just draw it out, as Sen-
ator LANKFORD said. 
I think it is important to point out 
in the process, if we had an amendment 
debate, if we had a debate on the Sen-
ate floor, if we cultivated and came up 
with a final product, it is still within 
the 60-vote margin for the other side to 
say: No. Can’t do it. It is not enough. 
Can’t go there. 
OK. At least we tried. Now we have 
nothing. 
As we move forward—I was on sev-
eral radio interviews today, and a lot 
of people want to know what is next. I 
don’t know what is next. We have to do 
better than this. We have to do better, 
with what we see happening in our 
country and listening to the cries. 
When I heard Senator SCOTT’s speech, 
when he talked of the communities 
that are most vulnerable, that have the 
most difficulties in all of the struggles 
of their lives, we owe it to them to 
have this debate on the floor of the 
greatest deliberative body, the Senate. 
We could have demonstrated a lot 
today, and it didn’t work. It was denied 
by 44 Senators. And here we are having 
to go back to our constituents, go back 
to those folks who are very vulnerable, 
and say: It didn’t matter enough to try 
to fix it. It didn’t matter enough that 
we gave each other 20 amendments. It 
didn’t matter enough that we were 
going to have the debate on the Senate 
floor. It didn’t matter enough to have 
our experts come in and tell us what 
the best is. It didn’t matter. 
I hope maybe, as time goes by, it will 
matter because this issue is not going 
away, and our passion to solve it as a 
collective body shouldn’t go away. I am

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3181 
June 24, 2020 
committed to seeing that it doesn’t go 
away. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this 
afternoon, we heard a lot of rhetoric. I 
would like to now deal with some re-
ality. As so often happens, the reality 
is different from the rhetoric. 
Since I last spoke on the Senate floor 
in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, 
the American people’s calls for justice 
and accountability have not dimin-
ished. Fortunately, they have grown 
stronger, and rightfully so. Even since 
then, our Nation has had to confront 
yet another needless killing of an Afri-
can-American man, when an Atlanta 
police officer shot Rayshard Brooks 
twice in the back when he was fleeing 
from officers. 
Now, I know from my own experience 
in law enforcement that nobody can 
dispute that police officers have in-
credibly challenging jobs. No one will 
dispute that they are faced with dif-
ficult, split-second decisions that im-
pact life and death, but that difficulty 
does not excuse the fact that some-
thing is deeply wrong in our country. It 
does not excuse the fact that people of 
color have disproportionately suffered 
from police misconduct. People of color 
disproportionately are profiled by po-
lice, are stopped by police, are arrested 
by police, and are victims of excessive 
force at the hands of police. 
Confronted with the killing of George 
Floyd, millions of Americans are de-
manding we do better as a nation. They 
recognize that longstanding societal 
prejudices and biases and have created 
a law enforcement culture and broader 
criminal justice system that perpet-
uates these prejudices and biases. They 
demand that we roll up our sleeves and 
do the hard work of ensuring that 
those charged with preserving the rule 
of law are also subject to it, that no 
person is above the law. 
For millions of Americans, the time 
to act is now, but I think the Senate is 
acting as though it is not up to the 
task. On Thursday, the House is ex-
pected to pass comprehensive legisla-
tion to reform policing, and it is going 
to do that with Republicans and Demo-
crats voting for it. The Senate has only 
advanced a patchwork of half-measures 
that would do little more than to place 
a handful of bandaids on deep, genera-
tions-old wounds. 
As someone who knows him, I don’t 
doubt at all that the legislation drafted 
by Senator SCOTT is a good-faith at-
tempt at finding consensus within the 
Republican Conference on how to re-
form policing, but by any reasonable 
measure, the bill the Republicans have 
put forward actually fails to reform po-
licing. On many of the most pressing 
issues, such as addressing true racial 
inequalities or disparities or discrimi-
nation, the Republican bill defers ei-
ther by doing nothing at all or by leav-
ing it to a future commission to study. 
The Republican bill purports to cre-
ate a new grant program to fund and 
mandate the use of body-worn cameras, 
which have been instrumental in hold-
ing both the police and suspects ac-
countable. Maybe everybody failed to 
notice, but Congress already created 
that program 5 years ago, and our 
Committee on Appropriations, in a bi-
partisan fashion, has been funding it 
every year since, all 5 years. This is 
not something new. 
The Republican bill would create 
grant incentives to encourage police 
departments to change behaviors. The 
legislation 
introduced 
by 
Senators 
BOOKER
and HARRIS
would actually 
change those behaviors. They don’t 
say: Here. Please do it. They say: Here. 
You have to do it. They do it by ban-
ning choke holds, and they ban no- 
knock warrants. 
Unlike the Booker-Harris bill, the 
Republican bill would not address 
qualified immunity, which allows offi-
cers to evade accountability even when 
a court finds they have violated con-
stitutional rights. Can you imagine 
anybody else in this country, when vio-
lating someone’s constitutional rights, 
standing up and saying: ‘‘But I am in a 
protected group. You can’t do anything 
about it. Bye, bye now. See ya’’? 
The Republican bill does nothing to 
address racial profiling. It does nothing 
to ensure that deadly force is used only 
as a last resort—not as a first resort 
and especially not against somebody 
who, while running away, gets shot in 
the back and is given the death pen-
alty. It also does nothing to ensure 
there will be Federal oversight when a 
local law enforcement agency dem-
onstrates a pattern of violating their 
citizens’ civil liberties. 
It is well-known that the Trump ad-
ministration has effectively abandoned 
pattern or practice investigations and 
consent decrees, which are proven in-
struments for positive change within 
some of our troubled departments. 
That is why the Booker-Harris bill 
strengthens these investigations at 
both the Federal and State levels. 
At every turn, where the Republican 
bill provides a talking point, the Book-
er-Harris bill provides real account-
ability and real transparency. Sadly 
and, I think, disturbingly, the fact that 
the majority leader will not even allow 
the Senate to debate the Booker-Harris 
bill reveals that he is interested in nei-
ther. 
For a moment last week, it appeared 
that some Republicans were serious 
about finding bipartisan compromise. 
During a Judiciary Committee hearing 
on policing reform, Chairman GRAHAM 
said he would like the committee to 
work together to find solutions, ‘‘to sit 
down’’ and see if we could ‘‘reconcile 
[the policing reform] packages and 
come up with something in common.’’ 
A number of Republican colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee even ex-
pressed an openness in reevaluating 
qualified immunity to ensure that 
there would be a sense of account-
ability within police departments. 
I agree that these are difficult issues, 
but certainly, based on my experience 
under both Republican and Democratic 
majorities, I know the Judiciary Com-
mittee is capable of handling them. I 
know because we have done it before on 
tough issues. Let me give you an exam-
ple. 
Seven years ago, a bipartisan group 
of Senators—Republicans and Demo-
crats across the political spectrum— 
put together a thoughtful, bipartisan 
bill to reform our immigration system, 
but the bill wasn’t put here on the Sen-
ate floor with a ‘‘take it or leave it.’’ 
As chairman of the Senate Judiciary, I 
held three hearings on the bill and then 
held 5 days of markups, some going 
late into the night. We considered 212 
amendments, 141 of which were adopt-
ed, including 50 amendments offered by 
Republicans and voted on by both 
Democrats and Republicans. Our proc-
ess was fair, thorough, and deliberate. 
What happened when it came to the 
Senate floor? There were 68 Senators 
from both parties across the political 
spectrum who supported the legislation 
and voted for it. 
Now, if we could replicate that proc-
ess 
for 
policing 
reform 
today—go 
through committee, have the debate, 
bring up the amendments, have the 
hearings, vote on something, and bring 
it here to the floor with that kind of 
strong support—I would suspect even 
more Senators, Democrats and Repub-
licans alike, would support it. 
Senator MCCONNELL is skipping all of 
that. He is not allowing the Judiciary 
Committee to do its work. He is not at-
tempting to build bipartisan com-
promise. He is, instead, forcing the 
Senate to take up a wholly inadequate 
partisan bill or to do nothing at all. 
‘‘Here, vote for this deeply flawed bill 
or you get nothing.’’ That is not being 
the conscience of the Nation. That is 
not why I and many others came to the 
Senate. That is not how the Senate 
gets things done, and every Senator, 
Republican and Democrat alike, knows 
that. 
So I would suggest to the leader, if he 
is serious about tackling racial injus-
tice and policing reform, that there is 
a blueprint to follow. This is not it. I 
urge the majority leader to reverse 
course. If he is unwilling to bring 
meaningful legislation to the floor to 
address these issues today, well then, 
allow the Judiciary Committee to put 
in the hard work that is necessary to 
build bipartisan consensus. I am sure it 
could be done within a couple of weeks 
of actual hearings and votes in our 
committee. 
Instead, the leader is insisting on a 
process that is designed to fail. In 
doing so, the Senate fails. The Senate 
fails George Floyd, and it fails Breonna 
Taylor, and it fails countless others 
who have been victims of brutality or 
discrimination by a flawed justice sys-
tem. In doing so, the Senate also fails 
the American people. 
I hope this is not the path we take. I 
voted not to go forward with a flawed 
process, hoping we might have a real 
bipartisan process. I believe the Senate

should be the conscience of the Nation. 
Let’s be so in this. Let’s go to com-
mittee, and let’s have Republicans and 
Democrats vote for or against amend-
ments and bring a bill to the floor. 
Stop these ‘‘take it or leave it’’ steps 
by the Republican leader. Let’s have a 
bill that both Republicans and Demo-
crats have worked on, and then bring it 
up. Let’s vote up or down on amend-
ments. Let’s give the American people 
something they can be proud of and 
something, finally, the Senate can be

I do not see another Senator who 
seeks recognition, so I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.

unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PRIDE MONTH 2020 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our 
Founders did not give us a perfect na-
tion. Even they knew that. When 
Thomas Jefferson, himself a slave-
owner, reflected on the existence of 
slavery in a nation which claimed to 
believe that all men are created equal, 
he wrote: ‘‘I tremble for my country 
when I reflect that God is just; that his 
justice cannot sleep forever.’’ 
Jefferson was not alone as a slave-
owner. George Washington—the name-
sake of this great city and another 
great State, the father of our Nation— 
and his wife owned 300 slaves. Just 
minutes before he died, he asked his 
wife to bring the two copies of his last 
will for him to look at for one last time 
and to decide. 
He handed one of the copies of the 
wills to his wife and said: Burn this 
one, and keep the other. What he 
burned would have released all of his 
slaves at the moment of his death. The 
one he signed said that they would con-
tinue to be his wife’s slaves for as long 
as she lived. He was the father of our 
Nation. We might not have had an 
independent nation without his skill 
and leadership; yet he was not a perfect 
man by any means. 
The true measure of a nation’s great-
ness is not simply the words written by 
an earlier generation; it is the work of 
every generation to make those words 
not just ideals but facts. We see that 
work all around us today. 
For weeks, Americans have joined to-
gether in an incredible display of con-
stitutional petition of this govern-
ment, of this Nation, for change. In cit-
ies large and small and in virtually 
every State, they are protesting sys-
temic 
racism 
and 
police 
violence 
against people of color. 
These protests have spread around 
the world. Videotapes and DNA evi-
dence have done more to assault the 
foundation of justice in America than 
anything in our history. 
In the midst of a pandemic caused by 
a new virus, a multi-ethnic, multigen-
erational alliance seems to have found 
a collective will to confront one of hu-
manity’s oldest viruses—the virus of 
racism. 
It was a different protest 51 years ago 
this month that began one of the new-
est chapters of America’s long struggle 
for equal rights. That protest is the 
reason that June is celebrated as Pride 
Month. 
It started in the early morning hours 
of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in 
the Greenwich Village section of New 
York City. Today, the name ‘‘Stone-
wall’’ stands as a milestone on Amer-
ica’s journey toward equal justice, 
alongside 
such 
revered 
names 
as 
‘‘Selma’’ and ‘‘Seneca Falls.’’ In 1969, 
however, the Stonewall Inn was a ram-
shackle refuge for outcasts—a home 
away from home for some of the poor-
est, most powerless members within 
one of America’s most marginalized 
communities. Its patrons included drag 
queens and lesbians, transgender and 
gender nonconforming people, home-
less LGBTQ youth who lived in nearby 
Christopher Street Park after being 
abandoned by their own families. 
Police raids and arrests were regular 
events at the Stonewall Inn, as they 
were at most gay bars in America at 
that time, but something changed dur-
ing that raid in the early morning 
hours of June 28, 1969. Something in 
this great universe shifted. That night, 
when the police became violent, the pa-
trons of the Stonewall Inn fought back. 
The Stonewall uprising was a 6-day 
protest against police mistreatment, 
and while the protests were contained 
almost entirely within Greenwich Vil-
lage, they changed the world. 
On the first anniversary of the Stone-
wall uprising, the first Gay Pride pa-
rade was held in New York and Los An-
geles and in the city of Chicago. Within 
2 years of that uprising, there were gay 
rights organizations in every major 
city in the United States and Canada, 
Australia and Western Europe. 
The month of June is now recognized 
throughout much of the world as Pride 
Month—a celebration of diversity, ac-
ceptance, and inclusion. 
Last year, on the 50th anniversary of 
Stonewall, the grand marshal leading 
Chicago’s Pride Parade was our city’s 
first openly gay mayor, Lori Light-
foot—an incredible leader. 
This year, most Pride parades and 
festivals in the United States and 
around the globe were canceled or 
transformed into virtual celebrations 
because of COVID–19, but those virtual 
gatherings still had much to celebrate. 
We have witnessed profound progress 
in the half-century since Stonewall. 
Public attitudes about gay and trans 
rights have increased greatly. Marriage 
equality is now the law of the land. 
Openly gay men and women serve as 
corporate and civic leaders, as mayors, 
Governors, Members of Congress, and 
an openly gay, married man just ran a 
serious campaign for President. Gay 
men and lesbians serve openly in Amer-
ica’s Armed Forces. While this admin-
istration has regrettably reinstated a 
ban on transgender persons serving 
openly in the military, trans men, 
women, and children are becoming 
more visible members in much of the 
rest of our society. 
This June also brings a major new 
cause for celebration. In a landmark 6- 
to-3 ruling, the Supreme Court of the 
United States has ruled that employ-
ment discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation and gender identity 
is prohibited under the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964. This is an amazing story in 
history, where an ultra-conservative 
Congressman from Virginia in 1964 
thought that he would torpedo the civil 
rights bill by adding the word ‘‘sex’’ 
into those bases for discrimination, 
thus inviting protection for women. He 
was sure that would be the end of the 
conversation. 
His 
amendment 
was 
adopted and of course led to a lot of de-
bate on gender equality and ending 
gender discrimination. Little did he 
know—or many others—that it would 
lead to this historic Supreme Court 
ruling when it came to sexual orienta-
tion. This is history happening before 
our eyes, and thank goodness—thank 
goodness—we are alive to see it. 
But work of equal justice under the 
law is never finished. We were re-
minded of that 2 weeks ago when the 
Trump administration released a dis-
criminatory rule that attempts to 
eliminate explicit healthcare protec-
tions for LGBTQ Americans. We are re-
minded that the work of equality is not 
finished each time we learn of another 
victim of alarming violence—violence 
against Black transgender women, in-
cluding the deaths of 25-year-old Riah 
Milton 
in 
Ohio 
and 
27-year-old 
Dominique ‘‘Rem’mie’’ Fells in Phila-
delphia. 
On May 29, 4 days after George 
Floyd’s murder, more than 100 of the 
Nation’s most prominent LGBTQ civil 
rights groups released a letter con-
demning racial violence. Their letter 
said that violence against transgender 
and gender nonconforming people of 
color happens ‘‘with such regularity, it 
is no exaggeration to describe it as a[n] 
epidemic of violence.’’ The groups went 
on to say: ‘‘We understand what it 
means to rise up and push back against 
a culture that tells us we are less than 
them, that our lives don’t matter. . . . 
Today, we join together again to say 
Black Lives Matter and commit our-
selves to the actions those words re-
quire.’’ 
Among the organizations signing the 
pledge are the Human Rights Cam-
paign, Equality Illinois, and the AIDS 
Foundation of Chicago. 
Nearly all Americans recognize Dr. 
King’s ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech at the 
1963 March on Washington. It was a 
great moment in America’s long strug-
gle for equal rights. But how many of 
us know that the organizational genius 
behind that great gathering was a gay 
Black man—Bayard Rustin? 
How many of us know the names of 
Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera—

activists and transgender women of 
color, members of one of the most 
marginalized and victimized groups in 
America. They were also leaders of the 
Stonewall uprising. They both contin-
ued to fight for gay and trans rights all 
of their lives—until Marsha’s death in 
1992 and Sylvia’s death a decade later. 
Years after Stonewall, Marsha P. 
Johnson recalled: 
History isn’t something you look back and 
say it was inevitable. [History happens] be-
cause people make decisions that are some-
times very impulsive and of the moment, but 
these moments are cumulative realities. 
James Baldwin, a brilliant writer and 
thinker, a gay Black man, warned us 
that ‘‘nothing can be changed until it 
is faced.’’ 
Stonewall was a tipping point. The 
protests today against the deaths of 
George 
Floyd, 
Rayshard 
Brooks, 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Tony 
McDade, 
Ahmaud Arbery, Laquan McDonald, 
Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland, and so 
many other Black men and women and 
children are, in fact, a tipping point. 
Let’s not look away from this his-
toric moment of change. Let this Sen-
ate join on the right side of history. 
Let’s not let a procedural setback on 
the floor of the Senate stop us from 
finding some common ground to move 
forward. 
Let’s 
acknowledge 
the 
rightness of this month’s Supreme 
Court decision and pass the Equality 
Act to make it plain that discrimina-
tion based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity is illegal and will not 
be tolerated, not just at your place of 
employment but all across America in 
every walk of life. Let’s act to end 
state-sanctioned violence and oppres-
sion against our Black and Brown 
brothers and sisters. Let’s do our part, 
in our time, to make the noble prom-
ises of our Founders real for all Ameri-
cans. 
DACA 
Mr. President, last week, in another 
landmark decision, the Supreme Court 
rejected President Trump’s effort to re-
peal 
deportation 
protections 
for 
Dreamers and young immigrants who 
came to the United States as children. 
In an opinion by Chief Justice John 
Roberts—an 
opinion 
which 
I 
have 
here—the Court held that the Presi-
dent’s decision to rescind the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals Program 
was ‘‘arbitrary and capricious.’’ 
It was 10 years ago—10 years—that I 
joined Republican Senator Dick Lugar 
of Indiana on a bipartisan basis to call 
on President Obama to use his legal au-
thority to protect Dreamers from de-
portation. President Obama responded 
by creating DACA, which provides tem-
porary—2 years at a time—protection 
from deportation to Dreamers if they 
register with the government, pay a 
substantial fee, and pass a criminal 
background check. 
More than 800,000 Dreamers came for-
ward to sign up for DACA. It unleashed 
the full potential of these young men 
and women, who are contributing to 
America as teachers and nurses and 
soldiers and small business owners. 
More than 200,000 DACA recipients are 
now characterized by our government 
as ‘‘essential critical infrastructure 
workers.’’ I didn’t make that up; it was 
a definition of President Trump’s own 
Department of Homeland Security. 
Two hundred thousand of the 800,000 
DACA recipients are essential critical 
infrastructure workers. Among these 
essential workers are 41,700 DACA re-
cipients in healthcare—doctors, inten-
sive 
care 
nurses, 
paramedics, 
res-
piratory therapists. 
But on September 5, 2017, President 
Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds of 
thousands of Dreamers faced losing 
their work permits and being deported 
to countries they barely remember. 
Thankfully, the Supreme Court has 
now rejected that effort. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
President, 
through his tweets, has responded by 
attacking the Court and threatening 
the DACA protectees again. But Chief 
Justice Roberts made it clear it is not 
going to be easy for the President to 
carry out his threat. The Chief Justice 
wrote that in order to repeal DACA, 
the administration must consider ‘‘ac-
commodating particular reliance inter-
ests.’’ Here is what it means: In order 
to repeal DACA, the administration 
must consider the interests of those 
who have come to rely on the program. 
This includes not just DACA recipients 
but their American citizen children, 
the schools where DACA recipients 
study and teach, and the employers 
who invested time and money in train-
ing them. 
Today, I am calling on President 
Trump to do the right thing for our Na-
tion and not make another effort to re-
peal DACA. Instead, the President 
should direct the Department of Home-
land Security to reopen DACA. Since 
2017, when the President announced the 
end of DACA, the program has been 
closed to new applicants. As a result, 
there are tens of thousands of Dream-
ers who have never been able to apply 
for their opportunity under DACA. 
Now Congress also has a responsi-
bility. Last week, President Trump 
tweeted, ‘‘I have wanted to take care of 
DACA recipients better than the Do 
Nothing Democrats, but for two years 
they refused to negotiate.’’ Here is the 
reality: President Trump has rejected 
numerous bipartisan offers to protect 
the Dreamers. 
One example: On February 15, 2018, 
the Senate considered a bipartisan 
amendment offered by Republican Sen-
ator MIKE
ROUNDS
and Independent 
Senator ANGUS KING, which included a 
path to citizenship for Dreamers. A bi-
partisan majority of Senators sup-
ported the amendment, but it fell short 
of the 60 votes needed to pass the Sen-
ate because of the Trump administra-
tion’s opposition. On that same day, 
the Senate voted on the President’s im-
migration proposal, and that amend-
ment failed by a bipartisan majority of 
39 to 60. In other words, we came close 
to 60 in a bipartisan effort to answer 
the President’s challenge. His response 
legislation received 39 votes for and 60 
against in the Senate. 
On June 4, 2019, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed H.R. 6, the Dream 
and 
Promise 
Act—legislation 
that 
would give Dreamers a path to citizen-
ship—with a strong bipartisan vote. 
The Dream and Promise Act has now 
been pending in the Senate, on the 
desk of Senator MCCONNELL, for more 
than 1 year. 
On Monday, I sent a letter signed by 
all 47 Democratic Senators calling on 
Senator MCCONNELL
to immediately 
schedule a vote on the Dream and 
Promise Act. The President has chal-
lenged us: Do something legislatively. 
Do something, Congress. 
Senator MCCONNELL, it is within 
your power for us to do something and 
to do it quickly. 
Over the years, I have come to the 
floor of the Senate many times to tell 
the simple stories of these Dreamers. 
These stories show what is at stake 
when we consider the fate of DACA. 
Today I want to tell you about Diana 
Jimenez. She is the 123rd Dreamer 
whose story I have told on the Senate 
floor. She came to the United States 
from Mexico at the age of 6 and grew 
up in Laredo, TX. She wrote to me, and 
here is what she said about her child-
hood: 
Growing up in the United States was both 
great and challenging. I loved the people, the 
culture, the language. At times it was also 
hard. Assimilating and learning English, a 
totally new language for me, came with its 
setbacks. Still, my neighbors, my teachers 
and the community around me were very 
welcoming. I’ll never forget that. 
When Diana was 13, her mother was 
admitted to the hospital. Because her 
mother didn’t speak English, Diana 
had to serve as a translator. This expe-
rience inspired her to become a nurse. 
Diana attended Texas A&M. She was 
on the dean’s list and offered a scholar-
ship for academic accomplishments, 
but she had to turn it down because she 
is undocumented. She went on to earn 
her degree in nursing and history, 
along with a minor in economics. 
Thanks to DACA, she now works as 
an operating room nurse on the cardio-
vascular/cardiothoracic specialty team 
in a hospital in Austin, TX. She is mar-
ried. She has a baby girl. 
Here is what Diane says about DACA: 
DACA means opportunity to me. I am glad 
I live in a country that gives me the chance 
to better myself if I want to. There are doors 
and opportunities for the taking all around 
me, and DACA is the key to my success. 
Now Diana is on the frontlines of the 
COVID–19 pandemic in a State that is 
seeing a dramatic increase in infection. 
She is worried about infecting her lit-
tle girl. Here is what she says about 
her experience: 
I have come in contact with patients in-
fected with COVID multiple times, and I will 
continue to do so as long as I am doing my 
work. . . . [E]ven though this pandemic has 
affected both my personal and professional 
life, I will continue to do my job as a nurse. 
I want to thank Diana Jimenez for 
her service. She is, in fact, a health

hero. She is a DACA health hero. She is 
putting herself and her family at risk 
to save American lives. Can we ask for 
anything more? She shouldn’t have to 
worry about whether a decision by this 
administration will lead to her depor-
tation. 
As long as I am a Senator, I am going 
to continue to come to the floor to tell 
the stories of people just like Diana Ji-
menez. It would be an American trag-
edy to deport this brave and talented 
nurse who is saving lives in the midst 
of this pandemic. 
We must ensure that Diana and hun-
dreds of thousands of others in our es-
sential workforce are not stopped from 
working when the need for their serv-
ice has never been greater, and we 
must give them the chance that they 
deserve to become American citizens. 
Would America be better if Diana Ji-
menez was returned to Mexico, if this 
nurse left the operating room at that 
hospital, if she decided that she could 
no longer stay in the United States and 
was forced, deported to leave in the 
midst of this pandemic? Of course not. 
Every American knows that—Demo-
crat, Republican, or Independent. 
Why don’t we stand together and re-
mind the President that there are val-
ues worth fighting for, and one of them 
is to make sure that this land of oppor-
tunity also has room for the immi-
grants who bring so much to our 
shores. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Tennessee. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
agree with the Senator from Illinois 
that there ought to be a legislative so-
lution to the DACA children. In fact, 
we had one in 2013. We worked on it in 
a bipartisan way—solved a large num-
ber of immigration issues, trying to 
have a legal immigration system. We 
sent it to the House, and the House 
didn’t consider it. I am ready to con-
tinue to do that. 
I disagree with one thing that hap-
pened today, though, about bringing 
bills to the floor. He talked about the 
importance of bringing the DACA legis-
lation to the floor. That is important 
once we have an agreement either in 
the committee or among us informally. 
The second bill that is very impor-
tant to bring to the floor is the Na-
tional 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act, 
which has been enacted for more than 
50 years and to which members of the 
Armed Services Committee have a 
chance to offer amendments. 
But Senator MCCONNELL is the ma-
jority leader, and because he is, he has 
one right, really, which is to decide 
what to bring to the floor. He pushed 
aside the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, which is important, and said: 
In these times, I think the important 
thing for me to do is to bring to the 
floor legislation on police reform and 
racial justice and allow the Senate to 
have an open amendment process. He 
did that in what would be the logical 
way. Since he is the majority leader, 
he offered a majority bill sponsored by 
Senator TIM SCOTT and cosponsored by 
a number of us on the Republican side. 
The vote we had a little earlier today 
was, shall we proceed to the issue of ra-
cial justice and police reform, starting 
with the Scott bill, with an open 
amendment process? 
Now what does that mean? That 
means that any Democrat could offer 
the House bill, or any Democrat could 
offer any other amendment. Now we 
have gotten into a bad habit around 
here, which I know the Senator from 
Illinois doesn’t like either, which is if 
he offers an amendment and I object to 
his amendment, and then, if I offer an 
amendment, he says: Well, you ob-
jected to mine; I will object to yours. 
And so we don’t have any amendments. 
But we should be able to bring an im-
portant bill to the floor, whether it is 
DACA or national defense or whether it 
is, criminal justice, and say that it is 
open for amendment, and let’s have 
amendments. 
I think that has happened so little 
over the last several years that people 
have forgotten how to do it. If you 
don’t like the amendment, someone 
can move to table it. That takes 51 
votes, and sometimes it is 60 votes. If 
we get to the end of the process and the 
minority side doesn’t like the bill the 
way it is, they can keep it from going 
off the floor by refusing to give 60 
votes. So it was very disappointing 
when the majority leader has taken a 
limited number of weeks and said: OK, 
I will give a week and a half to racial 
justice and police reform, starting with 
a majority bill and offering to the en-
tire Senate a chance to amend it. For 
the other side to say: No, we will not 
even let you go to the bill, I think is 
very disappointing. Senator SCOTT is 
disappointed, and many of us are, and I 
don’t believe it distinguishes the Sen-
ate when that occurs. 
PANDEMIC PREPARATION 
Mr. President, I came to the floor 
today to talk briefly about a hearing 
we held yesterday in the HELP Com-
mittee on the next pandemic: What do 
we need to do to prepare for the next 
pandemic? 
That caused at least one Senator to 
say: What are we doing talking about 
the next pandemic when we are in the 
middle of a big one right now and we 
have a lot of work to do? 
We do have a lot of work to do, but I 
want to answer that question. 
The reason we have to talk about the 
next pandemic is that we have short 
memories. Memories fade. We go on to 
the next issue, and we don’t do every-
thing we needed to do. 
We have had public health emer-
gencies before. Some Senators were 
here when anthrax drove Senators from 
their offices. There was SARS and the 
2009 flu pandemic. There was Ebola. 
There was MRSA. Four Presidents— 
Bush, Obama, Trump, and Clinton—all 
reacted to those in the way you would 
think. They issued reports, and they 
made proposals. We passed nine laws 
and many new regulations. We tried to 
do some things to be ready for the next 
public health emergency. We built 
buildings to manufacture vaccines. We 
created a new structure for managing 
public health emergency. We changed 
the way the national stockpile is man-
aged. We did a number of things. 
One of our witnesses yesterday was 
Senator Bill Frist, who was the major-
ity leader during the mid-2000s. He said 
he made 20 speeches on or about 2005 
when he said the only question about 
the next pandemic is not whether it is 
coming but when it will come. He list-
ed six things that needed to be done 
back then. Well, the reason we had the 
hearing yesterday was that we didn’t 
get all of those things done. 
Now, some people might say: Well, 
weren’t we prepared for this pandemic? 
And most experts felt that we were 
pretty well prepared. I read yesterday 
in the hearing a front-page story from 
the New York Times on March 1 of this 
year about COVID–19. Let me just go 
back. March 1 was 6 weeks after we 
knew about the disease. At the time, 
we had about 100 cases in the United 
States and only 2 deaths. There were 
many cases around the world. But at 
that time, the New York Times re-
ported that experts said it is ‘‘far from 
certain’’ that this disease would spread 
to all parts of the country, especially 
at the same time, and experts believed 
that the United States was as well pre-
pared as any country to deal with this 
pandemic. That was on March 1. Two 
and one-half weeks later, we began to 
shut down the whole country by order 
of the Government. 
So we were prepared, but we were 
surprised, too, and we underestimated 
this virus and how aggressive it is and 
how contagious it is and the fact that 
it can travel silently without symp-
toms. 
So Dr. Frist was one of the witnesses 
yesterday. Mike Leavitt, a former Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, 
former Governor of Utah, was another. 
Julie Gerberding, who was former head 
of the Centers for Disease Control, was 
yet another. She is now at Merck. Dr. 
Khaldun, who is the chief medical offi-
cer of the State of Michigan was there. 
We talked about the next pandemic. 
Why talk about it now? Because of the 
things that Dr. Frist mentioned 20 
years ago and the things that really 
need to get done, we didn’t get that all 
done in between pandemics. Why? We 
have short memories. Four or five 
months ago we were in the middle of an 
impeachment of the President. That 
sounds like ancient Roman history 
today. 
Our minds go on to the next crisis if 
we don’t get things done. So the time 
to look at the next pandemic is while 
we are in the middle of this one and 
say: What are we lacking? What could 
we do better? And let’s fix it while the 
iron is hot, while our eye is on it.

For example, one of the things that 
they suggested that we do—all of the 
witnesses—is that we have a dedicated 
source of funding for stockpiles and for 
research. 
Do you think that is easy to do? I 
don’t think it will be easy to get done. 
It took us years to pass the outdoor 
recreation bill, the Great American 
Outdoors Act, because of those kinds of 
funding issues. We are more likely to 
create a dedicated stream of funding 
for preparedness for the next pandemic 
if we do it in the middle of this pan-
demic, when we have our eye on the 
ball. 
Another recommendation is that we 
should have an office in the National 
Security Council to provide coordina-
tion between epidemics and during the 
next one. That is not easy to do, either. 
When is the best time to do it? Now, 
during this pandemic, when we have 
our eye on the ball. 
Another proposal that came up very 
often is that we ought to build manu-
facturing plants for vaccines that we 
don’t use between pandemics and that 
we ought to spend the money to keep 
them ‘‘open and warm,’’ in the words of 
Mike Leavitt, so that they are ready 
when suddenly a pandemic comes. 
Remember, this one hit us fast. 
There were not many cases on March 1 
and shutting down the government by 
the end of March. We need those manu-
facturing plants and that is something 
we haven’t gotten done in the way we 
should have gotten done—some of it. 
When is the next best time to do it? 
Now, while we have our eye on the ball. 
Strengthening our State and local 
public 
health 
systems—Governor 
Leavitt said that over the last 40 years, 
we have consistently underfunded our 
State and local health systems. They 
are the leaders in our effort to deal 
with this or any pandemic, including 
the next one. When is the next time to 
get over this bad habit of underfunding 
our State and local public health sys-
tems? Right now, when we see that we 
need it and we see what deficiencies we 
might have. 
Now on stockpiles, in between some 
of these earlier pandemics, we changed 
the management of the stockpile, spent 
some 
money 
to 
ensure 
protective 
equipment was in there and the things 
we need. It turned out not to be suffi-
cient. Why? The problem was that be-
tween pandemics, we took our eyes off 
the ball and budgets got tight and 
States and hospitals began to save 
money by getting rid of the things in 
their local stockpiles. So for all of 
those reasons, the things that we need 
to do need to be done now. 
I put out a white paper a few weeks 
ago inviting comment from experts 
around the country on what we need to 
do now to prepare for the next pan-
demic. Item No. 1 was tests, treat-
ments, and vaccines. How do we accel-
erate research and development? We 
are doing a good job now. Hopefully, we 
will learn from that for the next pan-
demic. 
On disease surveillance, there is a lot 
of criticism of the Centers for Disease 
Control’s inability to gather all the 
data it needs to track emerging dis-
eases in the way that it should. Now is 
the time to deal with that. 
Stockpiles, distributions, and surges 
in hospitals. We had to shut down hos-
pitals’ 
elective 
surgeries, 
creating 
enormous costs all across the country. 
We had to come up with $175 billion 
just over the last 3 months to try to 
help hospitals recover that. Can we not 
do a different job of preparing for the 
surge of patients that will come with a 
pandemic? Maybe the best time to do 
that is while we are in the midst of a 
pandemic. 
On public health capabilities, I men-
tioned strengthening the local public 
health system. Then, who is on the 
flagpole? Is there a better way to have 
a Supreme Allied Commander with all 
the various agencies that we have 
today. 
Those plus the need for dedicated 
funding are difficult issues. The answer 
to the question, ‘‘Why in the world are 
we having a hearing on the next pan-
demic when we are in the middle of 
this one?’’ is because for the last 20 
years, between pandemics, we hadn’t 
gotten the job done on some of the 
things that needed to be done that Dr. 
Frist mentioned when he was majority 
leader in 20 speeches, 20 years ago. So 
if we can’t do it between pandemics, 
let’s do it during a pandemic. That is 
what our hearing was about. 
It was a good hearing—terrific wit-
nesses, good suggestions. At the end, I 
asked all four witnesses to please sum-
marize the three things that each one 
thought should be done this year if 
they could. As it turns out, they are all 
hard to do, and, second, most of them 
would not only help with the next pan-
demic, but they will help with the cur-
rent one that we are in. 
That was our fourth hearing this 
month by the HELP Committee. We 
have had a hearing on going back to 
college safely. We had one on going 
back to school safely. Those two hear-
ings made clear to me the need for us 
to consider if we have another piece of 
COVID legislation in July, that it 
needs to include sufficient funds to 
make sure our 100,000 schools and 6,000 
colleges can open safely in the fall. The 
way to open the economy is to go back 
to school and back to college and back 
to childcare. That will get us back to 
work. Two-thirds of the married fami-
lies in this country have parents, both 
of whom work outside the home. Chil-
dren aren’t learning when they are let 
out of school in March and don’t go 
back to school in 6 months or maybe 
even in 8 or 10 months, if they don’t go 
back in the fall. So there is some 
health risk, but if we do our job here to 
provide sufficient funds in July to 
make sure our 100,000 schools and 6,000 
colleges can open safely, that will be 
the surest avenue toward normalcy in 
the year 2020 before we have a vaccine. 
We also had a hearing last week on 
telehealth. We have had 10 years of ex-
perience crammed into 3 months. We 
have gone from very little telehealth 
medical services delivered remotely to, 
in some cases, 40 percent or 50 percent 
of the doctor-patient visits being done 
remotely. Many people think that will 
level off at 15 to 20 percent. That would 
probably be the biggest change in de-
livery of medical services in our Na-
tion’s history. I can’t think of a bigger 
one. Hundreds of millions of visits will 
be done remotely instead of in-person. 
I recommended that at least the two 
major changes that we have made tem-
porarily in telehealth be made perma-
nent. Yesterday was what to do about 
the next pandemic. 
Next Tuesday will be our fifth hear-
ing this month, and it will include Dr. 
Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Hahn, and Ad-
miral Giroir, who will give us an up-
date on going back to school and col-
lege and work. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have my opening statement 
from yesterday’s hearing printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
OPENING STATEMENT 
COVID–19: LESSONS LEARNED TO PREPARE FOR 
THE NEXT PANDEMIC 
[June 23, 2020] 
Less than four months ago, on March 1— 
when the coronavirus had caused a little 
more than 3,000 deaths worldwide and 2 
deaths in the United States—The New York 
Times reported: ‘‘With its top-notch sci-
entists, modern hospitals and sprawling pub-
lic health infrastructure, most experts agree, 
the United States is among the countries 
best prepared to prevent or manage such an 
epidemic.’’ 
Even the experts underestimated the ease 
of transmission and the ability of this novel 
coronavirus to spread without symptoms. 
Those qualities have made the virus—in 
the words of infectious disease expert Dr. 
Anthony Fauci, ‘‘my worst nightmare.’’ 
‘‘In the period of four months, it has dev-
astated the world,’’ Dr. Fauci said recently 
in remarks at a virtual convention. 
This committee is holding this hearing 
today because, even with an event as signifi-
cant as COVID–19, memories fade and atten-
tion moves quickly to the next crisis. 
While the nation is in the midst of re-
sponding to COVID–19, the United States 
Congress should take stock now of what 
parts of the local, state, and federal response 
worked, what could work better and how, 
and be prepared to pass legislation this year 
to better prepare for the next pandemic, 
which will surely come. 
On June 9, I released a white paper out-
lining 5 recommendations for Congress to 
prepare Americans for the next pandemic: 
1. Tests, Treatments, and Vaccines—Accel-
erate Research and Development 
2. Disease Surveillance—Expand Ability to 
Detect, Identify, Model, and Track Emerging 
Infectious Diseases 
3. Stockpiles, Distribution, and Surges— 
Rebuild and Maintain Federal and State

Public Health Emergency 
I have invited comments, responses, and 
any additional recommendations for the 
Senate Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions to consider. This feed-
back will be shared with my colleagues, both 
Democrat and Republican. 
This is not a new subject for any of the 
witnesses we have today. 
Fifteen years ago, then Majority Leader of 
the Senate, Bill Frist, said in a speech at the 
National Press Club that a viral pandemic 
was no longer a question of if, but a question 
of when. He recommended what he calls a ‘‘6 
point public health prescription to minimize 
the 
blow—communication, 
surveillance, 
antivirals, 
vaccines, 
research, 
stockpile/ 
surge capacity.’’ 
Sen. Frist is one of our witnesses today. I 
am including two of his speeches in the hear-
ing record. 
Our next witness, Dr. Joneigh S. Khaldun 
(jo-NAY kal-DOON) serves as the Chief Med-
ical Executive and Chief Deputy Director for 
Health at the Michigan Department of 
Health and Human Services, where she has 
worked with other state and federal agencies 
to coordinate Michigan’s response to COVID– 
19. 
Another witness is Dr. Julie Gerberding, 
who served as the Director of the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention under Presi-
dent George W. Bush, and helped lead pre-
paredness efforts and the response to SARS, 
West Nile Virus, H5Nl avian influenza, and 
the rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria like 
MRSA. 
Another 
witness 
is 
Governor 
Michael 
Leavitt, who served as Governor of Utah and 
as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices and Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency under President George 
W. Bush. 
Following the emergence of HSN1 avian 
flu, Governor Leavitt increasingly focused 
his efforts on pandemic preparedness. As 
Secretary in 2007, he said this: ‘‘Everything 
we do before a pandemic will seem alarmist. 
Everything we do after a pandemic will seem 
inadequate. This is the dilemma we face, but 
it should not stop us from doing what we can 
to prepare.’’ 
Congress has passed legislation to prepare 
for pandemics before: During the past 20 
years, four Presidents and several Congresses 
enacted nine significant laws to help local, 
state, and federal governments, as well as 
hospitals and health care providers, to pre-
pare for a public health emergency, includ-
ing a pandemic. 
Congress provided over $18 billion to states 
and hospital preparedness systems over the 
last 15 years to help them prepare as well. 
In writing those laws, Congress considered 
many reports from presidential administra-
tions, Offices of Inspectors General, the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, and outside 
experts. 
The reports contained warnings that the 
U.S. needed to address the following issues: 
better methods to quickly develop tests, 
treatments, and vaccines and scale up manu-
facturing capacity: better systems to quick-
ly identify emerging infectious diseases; 
more training for the health care and public 
health workforces; better distribution of 
medical supplies; and better systems to 
share information within and among states, 
and between states and the federal govern-
ment. 
Many reports also warned that while states 
play the lead role in a public health re-
sponse, many states did not have enough 
trained doctors, nurses and health care pro-
fessionals; had inadequate stockpiles; and 
struggled with funding challenges. In some 
instances, overreliance on inflexible federal 
funding contributed to these problems. 
Looking at lessons learned from the 
COVID–19 crisis thus far, many of the chal-
lenges Congress has worked to address dur-
ing the last 20 years still remain. 
Additionally, COVID–19 has exposed some 
gaps that had not been previously identified. 
These include unanticipated shortages of 
testing supplies and sedative drugs, which 
are necessary to use ventilators for COVID– 
19 patients. 
Memories fade and attention moves quick-
ly to the next crisis. That makes it impera-
tive that Congress act on needed changes 
this year in order to better prepare for the 
next pandemic. 
I look forward to hearing from our wit-
nesses today and I also appreciate the feed-
back we are receiving on the white paper. I 
have set a deadline for June 26 on that feed-
back so the committee has time to draft and 
pass legislation this year. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this 
afternoon to speak about the bill that 
we voted on earlier today and the de-
bate that has ensued prior to that vote 
and I am sure afterwards. 
This is a moral moment for the coun-
try. I believe most would agree with 
that. The question is, How will our Na-
tion respond at this moral moment? 
The brutal murder of George Floyd 
by a police officer ‘‘shames us before 
the world.’’ I am quoting an NAACP of-
ficial who said it for all of us. His mur-
der did shame us before the world, so 
did the murder of Rayshard Brooks and 
Breonna Taylor, and we can go on from 
there, with so many names that we 
haven’t heard before, and many that 
we will hear over and over. 
A lot of us feel that shame. Countless 
millions of Americans feel that shame. 
They feel that sadness and they feel 
that anger all these weeks since that 
terrible moment that we all witnessed, 
and so many other moments before and 
after that. As they feel that shame and 
express anger and frustration, and as 
they protest and proclaim, as they 
march and mobilize, as they use their 
voice and cast their votes, they de-
mand change, but not simply change in 
and of itself, a certain kind of change— 
the kind of change we see rarely in 
Washington these days and, frankly, 
rarely over the course of American his-
tory, but I think we might be in one of 
those moments now. 
They demand transformative change. 
They demand, and appropriately so, 
systemic change to a criminal justice 
system that is infused with racism. 
Their righteous demand for change is, 
in fact, a petition for justice. 
In the 1950s and 1960s, Martin Luther 
King said it well, among many things 
he said well, about where we were then 
and, unfortunately, where we are now. 
His words still ring true. He said: ‘‘In-
justice anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere.’’ It is still true today in 
the context of this debate. 
But you can go back even further 
than what Dr. King said. You can go 
back hundreds of years. St. Augustine 
said it well, about justice. He said: 
‘‘Without justice, what are kingdoms 
but great bands of robbers?’’ 
Kingdoms as bands of robbers. There 
has been a lot of robbery over many, 
many years—even generations—when 
it comes to Black Americans. For hun-
dreds of years, Black Americans have 
been robbed of the equal protection of 
the law. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has embla-
zoned on the front portico of that 
building, just yards from here, ‘‘Equal 
Justice Under Law.’’ So many Black 
Americans have been robbed of equal 
justice under law. They have been 
robbed of opportunity—the opportunity 
to advance in a country that would not 
hold the color of their skin against 
them. They have been robbed of that. 
They have been robbed of their dignity 
over and over, in grave ways and in 
other ways that people never saw—all 
the indignities, all the insults, and all 
the mistreatment. Not to mention, 
worse than that, Black Americans have 
been robbed of the chance to truly pur-
sue the American dream. 
They have been robbed of peace of 
mind, something that those of us who 
are White should think about a lot 
more. I should think about more, as a 
White male, of the peace of mind that 
a parent has. A father or a mother 
should have the peace of mind in Amer-
ica when their son or daughter—but 
often it is their son—leaves the house 
in the morning: Will he be mistreated 
walking through a neighborhood by an 
official of our government law enforce-
ment or otherwise? Will he be pulled 
over and have his rights violated be-
cause of the color of his skin? Black 
Americans have been robbed of that 
peace of mind, in addition to so many 
other kinds of robbery that have im-
pacted their lives. 
So what do we do? Do we simply 
march and protest and express out-
rage? All of that is important. All of 
that is vital. In fact, all of that is one 
of the reasons we are even here talking 
about it on the Senate floor—people in 
both parties talking about it. In my 
home State of Pennsylvania, there are 
very few counties—just a handful of 
counties—that have not had one or two 
or many more protests in a State with 
67 counties. 
Part of what we have to do as legisla-
tors, as Members of this legislative 
body called the U.S. Senate, is to, in 
fact, legislate. Let me start with the 
bill that was introduced about 2 weeks 
ago, the Justice in Policing Act, S. 
3912. 
If I had to describe the bill in one 
word, it would be accountability. I 
think there is a big difference between 
that bill, the Justice in Policing Act, 
and the bill offered by the majority. 
Accountability is vital. It is essential. 
We cannot move forward and say that 
we have done something substantial to 
bring about justice and to advance the

June 24, 2020 
cause of justice unless there is ac-
countability. The bill also has very 
strong transparency provisions, as well 
as a long menu of actions we can take 
to improve police practices in a mean-
ingful way. Let me start with account-
ability. 
When we talk about accountability, 
we are talking about constitutional 
violations—preventing those violations 
and holding those accountable that en-
gage in constitutional violations. We 
could, for example, revise 18 U.S. Code, 
section 242. It is, right now, as a matter 
of law, a violation of law for any law 
enforcement officer to willfully deprive 
a person of any right protected by the 
Constitution. But it is almost impos-
sible for prosecutors to prove willful-
ness, and the Department of Justice 
doesn’t prosecute very many cases in a 
Nation of 18,000 law enforcement agen-
cies. 
This bill would revise the intent 
standard, known by the Latin ‘‘mens 
rea’’—the intent standard—to know-
ingly or with reckless disregard. So the 
change of that standard under law 
would make it more likely that suc-
cessful prosecutions can be brought 
when constitutional rights are violated 
in a criminal manner. 
The second constitutional violation 
provision speaks to civil liability. Re-
forming our civil liability laws are 
often referred to by a particular doc-
trine, qualified immunity. In cases 
where a citizen is a victim of police 
misconduct, this is a constitutional 
violation when it happens. Currently, a 
police officer who violates an Ameri-
can’s constitutional rights is often pro-
tected by a liability shield we know as 
qualified immunity. This doctrine has 
been questioned by many. There are at 
least two Supreme Court Justices, who 
don’t usually agree on much, that 
questioned it. Members of the U.S. Sen-
ate in both parties here have ques-
tioned this doctrine. Basically, the doc-
trine holds that police cannot be liable 
unless the conduct violates ‘‘clearly es-
tablished’’ standards or a standard set 
forth in prior cases, and most courts 
dismiss such cases. The bill would re-
form that doctrine of qualified immu-
nity to ensure that Americans can re-
cover damages in a case where their 
constitutional rights are violated by 
the actions of law enforcement. 
There are two provisions that speak 
to accountability. There is a third, as 
well, and I will not go through all of 
them. 
Accountability 
also 
means 
strengthening pattern-or-practice in-
vestigations 
by 
granting 
subpoena 
power to the Civil Rights Division at 
the Department of Justice, and also 
providing grants and funding to State 
attorneys general to conduct these pat-
tern-or-practice investigations at the 
State level. The focus here, again, is on 
constitutional violations that are sys-
temic in a local jurisdiction or sys-
temic in a State agency. 
What results from these kinds of in-
vestigations often are consent decrees. 
These consent decrees by courts are, of 
course, supposed to be judicially en-
forced. These decrees can often ensure 
that a police department implements 
reforms. Here is one of the problems. 
The Trump administration has vir-
tually 
abandoned 
this 
practice 
of 
bringing these pattern-or-practice in-
vestigations. The Obama administra-
tion opened 25 such cases. But even 
under the Obama administration, there 
was a constraint because of the lack of 
subpoena 
power. 
That 
should 
be 
changed. 
I will just mention two more provi-
sions. It is a long list, but I will just 
mention two more. The Justice in Po-
licing Act bans choke holds and bans 
carotid holds. And No. 5, it bans no- 
knock warrants in Federal drug cases. 
Now, what about the bill offered by 
the Republicans, the majority here in 
the Senate? The Republican bill does 
not, in my judgment, respond to this 
moral moment. It does not substan-
tially advance the cause of justice be-
cause it is devoid of provisions that 
would impose accountability—real ac-
countability—on law enforcement, and 
especially on a particular law enforce-
ment officer who is sworn to protect 
Americans. He is not sworn to violate 
their constitutional rights. So when a 
law enforcement officer engages in 
that conduct, there must be account-
ability. The bill does not speak to that 
in a fashion that I think would bring 
about change. 
The bill also doesn’t even explicitly 
ban choke holds and carotid holds, 
meaning a choke hold that cuts off 
your air flow, which we know can kill 
someone, and also the carotid hold, 
which cuts off your blood flow. We 
know that both can be dangerous. Both 
can be, in fact, lethal. The bill doesn’t 
ban them. That is the only reason, po-
tentially, we are even here debating 
this, because the American people— 
God only knows, tens of millions— 
watched a police officer choke the life 
out of a human being, George Floyd. 
Without that video, I am not sure we 
would be here debating this bill or any 
bill. But the idea that this practice is 
not banned under this bill makes the 
bill woefully deficient, and I think that 
is an understatement. 
The bill fails to ban no-knock war-
rants, even in the context—frankly, a 
limited context—of Federal drug cases. 
It doesn’t do that. That kind of a ban 
might have saved the life of Breonna 
Taylor, for example. The Republican 
bill doesn’t prohibit racial profiling, 
and it provides no change—no substan-
tial change—in the militarization of 
police forces. 
In the end, we are here not just to de-
bate and to focus on bills and policy in 
language, but we are here to talk about 
justice. There is a great hymn I heard 
in church over many years. It is rooted 
in the Scriptures. One of the refrains or 
one of the parts of the refrain of that 
hymn is this: ‘‘We are called to act 
with justice.’’ Those are the exact 
words of that hymn. The first couple of 
lines of the hymn are: ‘‘Come! Live in 
the light!’’ And then it goes on to say: 
‘‘We are called to act with justice.’’ 
If we are going to act with justice 
here by way of legislation, we should 
listen not just to the Scriptures or to 
Dr. King or to St. Augustine. We 
should also listen to a more recent Dr. 
King. He just happens to be the former 
Education Secretary, Dr. John B. King. 
He just testified a couple of weeks ago 
in our Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee, the committee 
that Senator ALEXANDER was talking 
about. 
Former Secretary of Education King 
said the following regarding students 
returning to school this year, and I 
think it bears directly not just on 
these justice issues but also on the 
broader agenda that we should push 
forward to advance the interests of 
Black Americans and communities of 
color. 
Dr. King, in this testimony just re-
cently, said the following. 
When our students return to school build-
ings, they will need additional supports as 
they grapple with the continued reality of 
racism in America and the legacy of over 400 
years of anti-Blackness. The murders of 
George Floyd— 
And then he lists some others— 
[Those murders] have once again sent the 
message to Black students that their lives 
are devalued. 
He goes on in his testimony to talk 
about the moment we are in—the mo-
ment I have called the moral moment, 
as have others. 
Dr. John King said: 
[We face a moment where] our nation’s 
students of color and their families also find 
themselves enduring a pandemic that dis-
proportionately impacts their health and 
safety, mired in an economic crisis that dis-
proportionately affects their financial well- 
being, and living in a country that too often 
still struggles to recognize their humanity. 
As Dr. Martin Luther King and Dr. 
John King, the former Secretary of 
Education, and others have told us, we 
have to make sure this is a moment we 
can act with justice, as the hymn tells 
us. 
All of us, no matter where we are 
from and no matter what party we are 
in—all of us—are called to act with jus-
tice. So let us not fail to act with jus-
tice in this moral moment. Let us em-
brace this moment. Pass the Justice in 
Policing Act or something very close 
to that, and bring the warm light of 
justice to millions of Americans, espe-
cially Black Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, there has 
been a lot of talk on this floor about 
border security in recent years. It is 
amazing how much of what is said re-
sembles what was said a quarter cen-
tury ago. I am equally amazed by how 
the politics of border security have 
changed over that time period.

publicized—President

S3188 
June 24, 2020 
Yuma, AZ, to highlight the continued 
need for border security. Now, as some-
one who has actually had firsthand ex-
perience 
with 
border 
security, 
I 
thought I would say a few words as 
well. 
As a U.S. marine in the 1990s, I spent 
months 
in 
a 
desolate, 
forbidding 
stretch of desert—my apologies to Ari-
zonans—that was a stone’s throw away 
from Yuma, AZ, the same place where 
these Border Patrol agents stand. Now, 
my marines and I were part of an un-
manned aerial vehicle unit. We worked 
with Border Patrol agents, like these 
gentleman, and we were charged with 
patrolling the border in the Yuma Sec-
tor. They were on the ground. We flew 
drone missions to help them collect in-
telligence. It is a dangerous area with 
heavy narcotics and human trafficking. 
While there, I saw the need for great-
er border security. Now, uniquely, 
among the military services—and I 
know our Presiding Officer had a dis-
tinguished career in the U.S. Army— 
the Marines are charged, by statute, 
with tackling whatever mission, how-
ever daunting, the President requests 
of us. In fact, in 1834, Congress passed a 
statute right on point, indicating, 
under the law, that the Marines would 
‘‘conduct such other duties as the 
President or Department of Defense 
may direct’’—pretty broad. It is pretty 
broad language. When in doubt, send in 
the Marines, I guess. 
Well, our unit’s mission—not glam-
ourous, but important then and impor-
tant now—was to help make the border 
more secure. It is a critical mission, 
which remained a priority under Presi-
dents Clinton and Bush. 
Later, a physical barrier was placed 
in the Yuma Sector. It was years after 
I left Active Duty. Trafficking de-
creased over roughly a decade’s time 
period by 95 percent after that physical 
barrier was erected. It shouldn’t be 
controversial. It is not ideological. 
This is just factual. We know walls 
work when properly and intelligently 
placed. 
Now, historically, there has been a 
bipartisan consensus around the idea 
that we not only put boots on the 
ground to protect the border but we 
also must invest in technology to se-
cure our border, including physical bar-
riers where they are required. The 
President was absolutely right years 
ago when he brought up this issue. He 
was right this week in Yuma, AZ. He is 
right today, and he will be right tomor-
row as he continues to emphasize this 
issue. We must address this situation 
that is taking place along our southern 
border. We mustn’t lose our resolve. 
There are illegal crossings and smug-
glers who are trafficking drugs and 
people that have created a horrific hu-
manitarian crisis and an ongoing na-
tional security threat. Don’t take it 
from me. According to the United Na-
tions Missing Migrants Project, more 
than 2,400 migrants have died near the 
United 
States-Mexico 
border 
since 
2014—2,400 migrants over a fairly short 
time period. This includes 497 deaths 
last year. That is a 26-percent increase 
from the year prior. This is a true hu-
manitarian crisis today. It is also a na-
tional security threat. 
In addition to migrants fleeing Cen-
tral America, it is possible that foreign 
terrorist organizations could penetrate 
this porous border. So border security 
and the safety of Americans has long 
been and should remain a priority of 
all Republicans and Democrats, espe-
cially those who serve here at the Fed-
eral level. 
President Trump is not the first 
President—underscore ‘‘not the first 
President’’—to understand this or to 
emphasize this issue. When I was serv-
ing in Arizona as a marine, President 
Clinton was our Nation’s Commander 
in Chief. During a 1993 press con-
ference, President Bill Clinton touted 
increasing the number of Border Patrol 
agents and working to supply them 
with the best possible equipment and 
technology. He repeated this message 
on multiple occasions. Then, during his 
1995 State of the Union address, Presi-
dent Clinton said: ‘‘Our administration 
has moved aggressively to secure our 
borders more by hiring a record num-
ber of new border guards.’’ President 
Clinton understood this, and he wasn’t 
the last Democrat to prioritize border 
security. 
President Obama, too, understood its 
importance. You see, we forget this. It 
is amazing how quickly we forget. 
Under the Obama administration, a 
surge 
of 
additional 
Border 
Patrol 
agents and resources were provided to 
secure the southwest border and to pre-
vent illegal crossings. In fact, this may 
be uncomfortable for some, but Presi-
dent Obama was often called the 
‘‘deporter in chief’’ during his Presi-
dency, with roughly 3 million people 
deported under the Obama administra-
tion. Again, border security should not 
be a partisan issue. 
Historically, both sides of the aisle 
have agreed that the humanitarian and 
security issues at our southern border 
must be addressed, so it is time for 
Democrats to partner with Senate Re-
publicans and President Trump to se-
cure the border and to put Americans 
first. 
If we resolve to work together on a 
sensible solution to this crisis—and I 
resolve to—the result will be safer bor-
der towns, more jobs for American 
workers, fewer strains on limited gov-
ernment resources, and a deterrent to 
foreign nationals coming to America 
illegally and putting themselves and 
others at great risk. 
So the Senate cannot lose its nerve 
when it comes to the rule of law in ad-
dressing border security. This is one 
area where we cannot just send in the 
Marines. We own this. This body owns 
this. Every U.S. Senator owns this 
issue, so we, the U.S. Senate, must 
work collectively. We must come to-
gether on this and work with our Presi-
dent to keep America safe and secure.

REMEMBERING SISTER THOMAS WELDER 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today with, frankly, 
a heavy heart and a fair bit of trepi-
dation. My goal over the next few min-
utes is to pay tribute to somebody who 
is so special, so remarkable, so beloved, 
so important to my home State of 
North Dakota that I feel inadequate, 
frankly. But here I am to pay tribute 
to Sister Thomas Welder, who died and 
went to be with the Lord on Monday 
morning of this week at the age of 80. 
Sister Thomas was for 31 years the 
president of the University of Mary and 
in the last several served as president 
emerita—very active. She was a mem-
ber of the Benedictine Sisters of An-
nunciation Monastery at Bismarck. 
She was a dear personal friend—and 
not just to me but to everyone. When I 
say ‘‘everyone,’’ I mean everyone who 
mattered. I am unprepared, frankly, to 
begin to really address all that she is 
and was and does and means to people. 
Madam President, first of all, I would 
like to ask unanimous consent to print 
in the RECORD her obituary, as well as 
the news release announcing her pass-
ing from the University of Mary. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
SISTER THOMAS WELDER 
[April 27, 1940–June 22, 2020] 
Sister Thomas Welder, 80, a member of the 
Benedictine Sisters of Annunciation Mon-
astery, Bismarck, and president of the Uni-
versity of Mary for 31 years, passed into eter-
nal life June 22, 2020, at the monastery, fol-
lowing a recent diagnosis of kidney cancer. 
Mass of Christian burial is scheduled for 
Monday, June 29, at 10:00 a.m. in Our Lady of 
the Annunciation Chapel (OLA) at the Bene-
dictine Center for Servant Leadership at the 
University of Mary. Visitation will be held 
at OLA from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. before the fu-
neral. Due to Covid–19 restrictions, the fu-
neral is limited to Welder’s family and close 
friends. The funeral can be viewed online 
through 
livestream 
at: 
www.umary.edu/ 
SisterThomas. A public vigil service with 
Evening Prayer will be held Sunday, June 28, 
at 7 p.m. in Our Lady of the Annunciation 
Chapel, with visitation prior from 1 p.m. to 
7 p.m. Sunday’s visitation and vigil service 
will also be livestreamed. 
Sister Thomas (baptismal name Diane 
Marie) was born in Linton, N.D. on April 27, 
1940, to Mary Ann (Kuhn) and Sebastian 
Welder. She was the oldest of three children. 
When she was two, the family moved to Bis-
marck. 
A graduate of St. Mary’s High School, she 
joined Annunciation Monastery after a year 
of college in Minnesota. Attracted by the 
community and prayer life of the sisters, she 
felt God’s call to become one of them. As a 
novice, she was given the name of Sister 
Thomas. She made her monastic profession 
on July 11, 1961. Sister Thomas cherished 
Benedictine monastic life which she lived 
faithfully for 59 years. 
She graduated from the College of St. 
Scholastica, Duluth with a bachelor’s degree 
in music and earned a master’s degree in 
music from Northwestern University, Evans-
ton, Ill. 
A dedicated servant leader, she gave her 
life to the University of Mary for 57 years.

June 24, 2020 
She led from her heart and touched the lives 
of many. She was president from 1978 to 2009. 
Under her remarkable leadership, the school 
attained university status in 1986; tripled in 
size from 925 students to 3,000; added the uni-
versity’s first doctorate, grew on-site and on-
line adult learning programs to 16 locations 
across the state, region and nation, and 
moved to NCAA Division II athletics. 
Sister Thomas was present to students, 
faculty and staff. She attended student recit-
als and concerts, cheered at athletic events 
and participated in many university gath-
erings. She called students by name and her 
genuine caring attitude left a deep impres-
sion on them. She enjoyed getting to know 
friends of the university whose financial as-
sistance made growth possible. After her re-
tirement as president, she was named Presi-
dent Emerita and served in the university’s 
Mission Advancement Office. 
One of the most widely known and highly 
respected women in North Dakota, Sister 
Thomas loved visiting with people of all ages 
and walks of life. People gave her energy. 
She would focus her entire attention toward 
listening to the person right in front of her. 
Her enthusiastic spirit, sense of humor, and 
gentle nature made others comfortable in 
her presence. It was a joy to be with Sister 
Thomas. 
Sister Thomas modeled many Benedictine 
values, such as hospitality, respect, prayer 
and service, with ease and grace. Benedictine 
values were dear to her heart. She com-
mitted herself to instilling these values 
throughout the monastery’s sponsored insti-
tutions, the communities of CHI St. Alexius 
Health and the University of Mary. 
She served on many state and national 
boards including CHI St. Alexius Health and 
MDU Resources Group, Inc. She received nu-
merous honors during her lifetime including 
North Dakota’s highest honor, the Theodore 
Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. 
Music was one of her passions. She directed 
the Sisters’ Choir for 46 years and gave cred-
it to the choir for the beautiful liturgical 
music. 
Sister Thomas was grateful for many bless-
ings in her life. She was particularly thank-
ful to two kidney donors who gave her the 
gift of life through two kidney transplants. 
She often prayed for and stayed connected to 
these special people. 
A beloved woman of faith, wisdom, and hu-
mility, Sister Thomas gave all of herself to 
so many for so long. She will be deeply 
missed. 
She is survived by a sister, Judy (Steve) 
Jankus, 
Navarre, 
Fla.; 
a 
sister-in-law, 
Marcia Welder, Apple Valley, Minn.; an aunt, 
Sister Alene Kuhn, SSND, Mankato, Minn.; 6 
nieces and nephews, 11 grand nieces and 
nephews, one great grandniece, and the Sis-
ters of Annunciation Monastery. 
She was preceded in death by her parents 
and her brother, George. 
Memorials may be made to Annunciation 
Monastery or the University of Mary. 
[Posted by University of Mary, June 22, 2020] 
ICONIC SERVANT LEADER, EDUCATOR AND UNI-
VERSITY PRESIDENT EMERITA, SISTER THOM-
AS WELDER HAS DIED 
BISMARCK, 
ND.—Former 
University 
of 
Mary President Sister Thomas Welder, OSB, 
has passed away at her Annunciation Mon-
astery home early this morning, June 22, 
south of Bismarck, ND, following a recent di-
agnosis of kidney cancer. 
Revered locally, regionally and nationally 
as a true servant-leader for living the Gospel 
of Jesus, the 80-year old Welder cared for the 
Christ-like development of all University of 
Mary students and the well-being of all fac-
ulty, staff, and her beloved Sisters of Annun-
ciation Monastery. 
‘‘Sister Thomas lived her life for others,’’ 
said Sister Nicole Kunze, Prioress of Annun-
ciation Monastery. ‘‘She was always giving 
to others, whether it was a smile, an encour-
aging word or a promise of prayer. She often 
said that the greatest gift you could give a 
person was the gift of your time, and she did 
that without fail. Sister Thomas modeled so 
many of our Benedictine values with ease 
and grace. She truly received all as Christ. 
She was intent on maintaining a vibrant 
connection between the sisters of the mon-
astery and our sponsored institutions.’’ 
The Sisters sponsor the University of 
Mary, where the public will be able to gather 
and memorialize her life and lay her to rest. 
The celebration of Welder’s life will take 
place over two days. 
The public is welcome to join the following 
memorial ceremonies and funeral online 
through livestream at www.youtube.com/ 
universityofmary/live. A public visitation is 
planned from 1 p.m. until 7 p.m. on Sunday, 
June 28 in Our Lady of the Annunciation 
Chapel (OLA), located in the Benedictine 
Center for Servant Leadership building on 
campus. A vigil service with Evening Prayer 
will follow at 7:00 p.m. Before her funeral at 
10:00 a.m. in OLA on Monday, June 29, a sec-
ond public visitation will be held prior from 
9 a.m. until 10 a.m. The funeral is open to 
Welder’s family and close friends. 
Welder will then be immediately buried 
after Mass in the nearby Monastery Ceme-
tery located on the west bluff next to the 
Benedictine Center for Servant Leadership, 
overlooking the Missouri River. 
‘‘Sister Thomas Welder was a rare person,’’ 
said University of Mary President Monsignor 
James Shea. ‘‘Under her leadership and vi-
sion, the University of Mary was confirmed 
in its purpose to form leaders in the service 
of truth in renewed and ever-growing ways, 
and Sister Thomas’s leadership touched 
thousands of students’ lives as the university 
grew and expanded over her presidency. But 
perhaps even more than this, Sister Thomas 
was known for her attentiveness, her humil-
ity, her heart for service, and her love for 
her vocation as a Benedictine Sister of An-
nunciation Monastery. It was these quali-
ties, too, which touched innumerable lives 
over the course of her life.’’ 
In 2019, Bismarck’s CBS affiliate, KXMB 
TV, honored Welder for Women’s History 
Month. During that interview, when reporter 
and anchor Lauren Kalberer asked Welder 
what she thinks about being regarded as one 
of the most influential women of our time, 
‘‘It gives me pause. First of all, what do we 
mean by influence? And, what kind of a dif-
ference can we make, because, as I think of 
leadership, I think about it much more in 
terms of influence, than I do of power or con-
trol,’’ responded Welder. 
During that same TV interview, Shea com-
mented, ‘‘Sister Thomas Welder—more than 
leading by words, leads by her example and 
by the way she treats people.’’ 
Welder influenced millions of people during 
her lifetime, and more profoundly, so many 
students during her time as the longest serv-
ing female university president in American 
history from 1978 to 2009. Her joyful laugh, 
witty humor, profound wisdom, and genuine 
love and respect for others were hallmarks of 
her character as she lived the Benedictine 
values. Her knack for remembering names, 
particularly 
the 
thousands 
of 
students, 
alumni and faculty, is one of her most gifted 
qualities that will be forever treasured. 
‘‘With an incredible ability to remember 
names and faces of almost everyone she met, 
Sister Thomas was always focused on the 
person directly in front of her,’’ added 
Kunze. ‘‘Her attention to the details of daily 
lives and family members of those she met 
would be recalled in future encounters. Stu-
dents, faculty, staff, and guests of the Mon-
astery would marvel when she asked about 
people and situations in their lives that had 
been discussed months, even years, earlier. 
She had a ready laugh and gentle nature 
that made others comfortable in her pres-
ence.’’ 
Welder, a Bismarck native, attended the 
College of St. Benedict, graduated from the 
College of St. Scholastica, Duluth, and 
earned a master’s degree in music from 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Illi-
nois. She is a member of the Benedictine Sis-
ters of the Annunciation Monastery. 
Welder began her career as a teacher at the 
university in 1963, when it was named Mary 
College. As president, Welder helped the 
school gain university status, experienced 
steady 
growth, 
added 
numerous 
under-
graduate and on-site graduate degree pro-
grams throughout North Dakota, helped 
make Mary one of the premier institutions 
for the preparation of leaders, and fostered 
leadership development in students and col-
leagues. The Norsk H-stfest Association in-
ducted Welder into the Scandinavian-Amer-
ican Hall of Fame, she received the Lifetime 
of Caring Award from the United Way, and 
on May 4, 2004, she earned the state’s highest 
honor from Governor John Hoeven—the 
Theodore Roosevelt Roughrider Award—pre-
sented to individuals who have received na-
tional recognition, reflecting credit and 
honor upon North Dakota and its citizens: 
‘‘. . . Sister Thomas promotes competence 
in communication, a commitment to values 
and service to community. Her strong belief 
of growing into leadership through service 
stands as a model for North Dakota and the 
nation,’’ reads an excerpt from the plaque 
beneath her portrait that hangs in the North 
Dakota Hall of Fame in the lower level of 
the State Capitol Building. 
During the later years of her presidency, 
Welder endured chronic kidney complica-
tions that led to a transplant in 2001. In 2005, 
she learned that due to a virus she would 
need a second kidney transplant, but had to 
regularly undergo dialysis until a successful 
second kidney transplant could be done in 
2011. 
At the start of Shea’s current presidency 
in 2009 and after her 31-year tenure as the 
fourth University of Mary president, Welder 
continued to be involved with University of 
Mary as president emerita—remaining active 
with public speaking events, committees and 
fundraising in the department of Mission Ad-
vancement. 
In lieu of flowers, if you wish to honor the 
memory of Sister Thomas Welder, her love 
for University of Mary’s students, lifelong 
mission of servant leadership, and genuine 
care for others, memorial donations are 
being accepted to Annunciation Monastery 
or for the university’s Sister Thomas Welder 
Scholarship 
Fund

the Office of Mission Advancement in care of 
the Sister Thomas Welder Scholarship Fund 
at 7500 University Drive, Bismarck, ND,

Mr. CRAMER. I am going to read 
some of the facts of her life from her 
obituary and do my best to fill in some 
personal thoughts while I do that. I am 
not going to read the entire thing. 
It starts out: ‘‘Sister Thomas Welder, 
80, a member of the Benedictine Sisters 
of Annunciation Monastery, Bismarck, 
and president of the University of Mary 
for 31 years, passed into eternal life 
June 22, 2020, at the monastery, fol-
lowing a recent diagnosis of kidney 
cancer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3190 
June 24, 2020 
‘‘A graduate of St. Mary’s High 
School, she joined Annunciation Mon-
astery after a year of college in Min-
nesota. Attracted by the community 
and prayer life of the sisters, she felt 
God’s call to become one of them. As a 
novice, she was given the name of Sis-
ter Thomas. She made her monastic 
profession on July 11, 1961. Sister 
Thomas cherished Benedictine monas-
tic life which she lived faithfully for 59 
years.’’ 
I recall a speech—or an interview— 
once at an event. In fact, I think it was 
during her retirement. She was asked 
about monastic life. She was asked: 
What is it that grounds you? Where is 
it you get your inspiration? 
She said: ‘‘My wellspring are the Sis-
ters of Annunciation Monastery.’’ 
Skipping down a little bit, her obit-
uary reads: ‘‘A dedicated servant lead-
er’’—and we will speak to that in a lit-
tle bit—‘‘she gave her life to the Uni-
versity of Mary for 57 years. She led 
from her heart and touched the lives of 
many. She was president from 1978 to 
2009.’’ 
I had the great honor of serving as 
the master of ceremonies at her 30th 
anniversary as president. 
‘‘Under her remarkable leadership, 
the school attained university status 
in 1986; tripled in size . . . ; added the 
university’s first doctorate, grew on- 
site and online adult learning programs 
to 16 locations across the state, re-
gion’’ and the country, and moved the 
school from NAIA to NCAA Division II 
athletics. 
This is an important line: ‘‘Sister 
Thomas was present to students, fac-
ulty and staff.’’ I will elaborate on that 
a bit as well. 
‘‘She attended student recitals and 
concerts, cheered at athletic events 
and participated in many university 
gatherings. She called students by 
name and her genuine caring attitude 
left a deep impression on them. She en-
joyed getting to know friends of the 
university whose financial assistance 
made growth possible.’’ 
I went on many fundraising calls 
with her. 
‘‘After her retirement as president, 
she was named President Emerita and 
served in the university’s Mission Ad-
vancement Office.’’ 
I had the great honor of working with 
her and then working for her after she 
hired me and then working with her 
again as a member of the board of 
trustees and sharing and serving on 
many boards and committees at the 
university. 
Her obituary goes on to say: ‘‘One of 
the most widely known and highly re-
spected women in North Dakota, Sister 
Thomas loved visiting with people of 
all ages and walks of life. People gave 
her energy. She would focus her entire 
attention toward listening to the per-
son right in front of her.’’ 
Boy, do we need that lesson here, Sis-
ter Thomas. We need you to teach us. 
Let me say that again: ‘‘She would 
focus her entire attention toward lis-
tening to the person right in front of 
her.’’ 
In fact, in a TED talk she did for 
TEDx on TV about, I think, 3 years ago 
or so—she was speaking to a lot of 
young people, of course, at this TED 
talk 
and 
was 
talking 
about 
connectivity, and she was speaking to 
the issue of monastic life and commu-
nity and the stability that comes from 
being grounded in a community, while 
also talking about—not criticizing, 
mind you; she was rarely critical—but 
speaking of the challenges of the dig-
ital era. She said this: ‘‘The challenge 
is to be fully present to those around 
us. The challenge is to be fully present 
to those around us, to engage face to 
face with one’s child, with a colleague, 
with a neighbor. . . . ’’ and she went on 
to say ‘‘even that person who may not 
be in our circle of friends.’’ 
See, she didn’t just speak to this 
value of being present; she was present. 
She was the epitome of always being 
present. In fact, her humility caused 
her to always deflect attention away 
from herself and to the person in front 
of her. 
Earlier I mentioned that in the obit-
uary it mentions she called the stu-
dents by name, and this is perhaps the 
best example of what I mean when I 
say she was always present: The Uni-
versity of Mary had about 3,000 stu-
dents a year by the time she retired. 
She knew them all by name, and when 
she would greet students, faculty, 
friends, neighbors, supporters of the 
university, she always called you by 
name—but not just you; she asked 
about your spouse by name, your chil-
dren by name. We all thought that was 
some special spiritual gift—a big brain 
with an incredible memory that just 
automatically recalls people’s names. 
Yeah, she was really smart. She had a 
good memory, to be sure. But she 
didn’t call us by name because she had 
a great memory; she called us by name 
because it was important to her be-
cause she knew it was important to us. 
It was a conviction, a commitment 
that she had to being present all the 
time. It was a remarkable thing—a re-
markable thing. 
Sister Thomas modeled many Bene-
dictine values at the University of 
Mary. We learned them all, all the 
time. The six that they highlight there 
are the Benedictine values of hospi-
tality, respect for persons, prayer, 
moderation, service—really important, 
as she called them, gospel values. But 
she didn’t just call them gospel values. 
She didn’t just teach them, although 
she does a lot. 
By 
the 
way, 
the 
internet 
and 
YouTube are full of her speeches on 
Benedictine values and other values 
and leadership, especially servant lead-
ership. 
‘‘She committed herself to instilling 
these values throughout the mon-
astery’s sponsored institutions,’’ which 
included, of course, the University of 
Mary and CHI St. Alexius Health. 
‘‘She served on many state and na-
tional boards including CHI St. Alexius 
Health and MDU Resources Group,’’ a 
Fortune 400 corporation. 
‘‘She received numerous honors dur-
ing her lifetime including North Dako-
ta’s highest honor, the Theodore Roo-
sevelt Rough Rider Award.’’ 
She earned them all. She earned 
them all. In fact, whenever she was 
complimented—which was often, as 
you might imagine, when you know as 
many people as she knows and have ac-
complished as much as she accom-
plished—she always, as I said earlier, 
deflected 
her 
accomplishments 
and 
gave someone else credit. 
She said this in an interview once 
when confronted with her many accom-
plishments: 
‘‘I 
have

blessed with the sense that I can do 
only what I do with the guidance and 
the help of the Spirit.’’ Think of that. 
All that she accomplished—she takes 
no credit but credits the fact that she 
was blessed with the sense that at least 
she was aware that the Spirit was the 
one that was guiding her. 
Her obituary also states: ‘‘Sister 
Thomas was grateful for many bless-
ings in her life. She was particularly 
thankful to two kidney donors who 
gave her the gift of life through two 
kidney transplants. She often prayed 
for 
and 
stayed 
connected’’—con-
nected—‘‘to these special people.’’ 
In that TEDx speech that I talked 
about from about 3 years ago, she was 
talking about connectivity, as I said. 
She was challenging them. She said: 
‘‘A disconnect from our cellphone or 
iPad makes possible a reconnect with 
those around us.’’ 
‘‘A disconnect from our cellphone or 
iPad makes possible a reconnect with 
those around us.’’ 
I could share lots of personal stories. 
I am tempted to, but I don’t think that 
would be the tribute she would want. 
She and I made a lot of calls to-
gether. We went on a lot of road trips 
together. We spoke at a lot of the same 
events. I was always grateful when I 
could go first. It was impossible to fol-
low her—an incredible speaker. 
One time we were at an event—I 
think I was the emcee, actually—a 
local event in Bismarck. She gave one 
of her phenomenal speeches. They all 
are. They all were. In the audience, un-
beknownst to me, was the president of 
the National Automobile Dealers Asso-
ciation. He came up to me afterwards, 
and he said: ‘‘Do you realize that every 
year we pay about $50,000 for a speaker 
at our national annual meeting, and we 
have never had one this good?’’ 
I said: ‘‘Well, I could get her to do it 
for less.’’ 
He said: ‘‘It is unbelievable. I have 
never been this inspired in my life.’’ 
I would just challenge everybody who 
has a minute and wants to be inspired 
to just do a quick Google search of Sis-
ter Thomas Welder, and you will find a 
video that will inspire you. 
Every person I know who ever met 
her is better because they did, every-
body I know whom she encountered. I

wizard of Westwood, the winningest 
coach in NCAA history, to the Univer-
sity of Mary to give a speech on serv-
ant leadership. It was a remarkable 
time. I sat there, and as I watched 
Coach Wooden—he was 96 years old at 
the time—come up to the stage after 
Sister Thomas introduced him, I stood 
between them and I thought, wow, I am 
between saints, two of the best servant 
leaders, who both taught and lived that 
incredible value. 
As I said, my heart is heavy. It is 
hard not to be sad. Yet Sister Thomas 
and I, of all of the things we talked 
about over the many years that I 
worked with her and for her, talked 
mostly about matters of faith. 
I am not Catholic. I do have a degree 
from the University of Mary. I am on 
their board of trustees. I love the place. 
I love the Sisters of Annunciation Mon-
astery and Sister Thomas especially 
because she embodies all that is good 
about them. But we always talked 
about matters of faith. 
I will never forget one trip to Fargo. 
I will never forget, in fact, where we 
were—sitting in my car, waiting to go 
in to call on somebody about a gift to 
the school. And we talked about Heav-
en. She said: ‘‘I think we’re going to be 
surprised at who we will see there.’’ 
And I thought, yeah, you are probably 
right. 
She gets the blessing of being there 
first now and seeing who all is there, 
but there will be a lot of people there 
who know her, and they are looking 
forward to welcoming her and thanking 
her for the incredible gift she was in 
their life. I look forward to the day 
when I can go and be welcomed by her. 
I am grateful for her life. 
I love you, Sister Thomas. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
hope today’s events in the Senate will 
not soon be forgotten by the American 
people. Over the last few months, it is 
an understatement to say that our 
country has experienced unprecedented 
physical, financial, and social turbu-
lence. From the pandemic, to the eco-
nomic challenges that came on its 
heels, 
to 
the 
widespread 
protests 
against racial injustice—the needs of 
our country should have transcended 
politics. Unfortunately, that does not 
seem to be the case today. 
We had been on a pretty good run, 
Republicans and Democrats, and put 
aside our differences to pass bold and 
transformative legislation to support 
our Nation’s fight against COVID–19, as 
well as ease the ensuing financial fall-
out. I had hoped that trend would con-
tinue as we work together to address 
the injustices that still persist in our 
society, beginning with police reforms. 
As we all know by now, thanks to our 
friend Senator TIM SCOTT and others 
who worked with him, we introduced 
the JUSTICE Act to enact real and 
lasting reform so we can begin to re-
store the broken trust between minor-
ity communities and our law enforce-
ment agencies. This package of bills 
addresses some of the most pressing 
changes that Americans have been call-
ing for—ending choke holds, better 
training for our police officers, ac-
countability for body cameras, more 
diverse police forces, and the list goes 
on and on. 
We know it wasn’t the only bill that 
has been introduced in this Senate. Our 
Democratic colleagues introduced a 
bill of their own, which would address 
many of the same issues. While there 
are some important differences be-
tween the two, what to me is more im-
portant is that there was a lot in com-
mon, a lot of overlap between those 
two bills. That should have, in a nor-
mal time, when people were logical and 
reasonable, put us on a strong footing 
to begin debating the ultimate product, 
which is what our Democratic col-
leagues actually asked us to do. 
A couple of weeks ago, the Demo-
cratic leader came to the floor and 
urged the majority leader to bring a 
police reform bill to the floor to be de-
bated and voted on before July Fourth. 
When Senator MCCONNELL did exactly 
that, what did they do? As soon as they 
were told they would actually have a 
chance to vote on a police reform bill, 
they changed their tune—a 180-degree 
change. 
It kind of reminds me a little bit of 
last year’s debacle over the Green New 
Deal. After this resolution was intro-
duced, a number of Senate Democrats 
rushed to endorse it, but when given 
the opportunity to vote on the resolu-
tion they were praising, what hap-
pened? Not a single one of those indi-
viduals on the other side of the aisle 
voted for it—not one. What kind of 
games are they playing here? Senator 
MARKEY, who introduced that resolu-
tion in the Senate, even accused the 
majority leader, who scheduled a vote 
on a bill he was the lead sponsor for— 
he called it sabotage. 
History seems to be repeating itself 
and not—not—in a good way. Our 
friends across the aisle, who have been 
asking to debate and vote on a police 
reform bill, this morning had that op-
portunity, but once again, they pulled 
a 180. 
Let me be clear on what we were vot-
ing on this morning. This was not a 
vote to finally pass the JUSTICE Act 
as is, without any changes or amend-
ments; this was simply a vote to begin 
debating the bill. You can’t finish a 
bill, you can’t actually vote on legisla-
tion if you are unwilling to start. And 
that is exactly what happened this 
morning. 
Knowing that Republicans and Demo-
crats did have some differences, even 
though there is a lot in common, Lead-
er MCCONNELL provided for the oppor-
tunity to have that debate right here 
on the Senate floor. We could have had 
that debate in front of the American 
people. I think it might have helped, 
No. 1, as Senator SCOTT likes to say, 
send a signal that we actually are lis-
tening, we hear you, we see you, and we 
are responding to you—no backroom 
negotiations like apparently what our 
Democratic colleagues want; rather, an 
open and honest debate right here in 
full view of the American people. 
Our Democratic colleagues refused to 
participate in the process and have 
blocked us from even considering po-
lice reform legislation. This ‘‘my way 
or the highway’’ legislative strategy 
we have come to expect from our col-
leagues is absolutely shameful, and it 
is counterproductive. 
I 
remember 
talking 
to 
Rodney 
Floyd—George Floyd’s brother—short-
ly before his funeral, and he said: Sen-
ator, we are from Texas. What we want 
for George is Texas-sized justice. 
I said: Rodney, I am going to do my 
very best to deliver. 
Unfortunately, even though there 
were many of our Democratic col-
leagues who decried the cruel and trag-
ic death of George Floyd, when it came 
time to step up and actually do some-
thing about it, they absolutely refused. 
Let me just go over quickly what the 
bill would have done as proposed. Sub-
ject to amendments and votes, there 
would have been multiple opportuni-
ties to stop the bill if it wasn’t heading 
in the direction they liked. 
First of all, this would have made 
lynching a Federal crime. That provi-
sion in the bill was actually authored 
by Senators HARRIS and BOOKER, but 
believe it or not, they filibustered and 
blocked their own bill. 
The JUSTICE Act would have ended 
the choke holds and prevented this 
dangerous and outdated tactic from 
being used in police departments across 
the country, but what did our Demo-
cratic colleagues do? They blocked it. 
This legislation would have helped 
local police departments improve mi-
nority hiring so that the departments 
would look more like the communities 
they served. Our Democratic colleagues 
blocked that too. 
This bill would have strengthened 
the use and accountability for body 
cameras, improved access to deescala-
tion and duty to intervene training, 
and established two commissions to 
give us a better understanding of the 
challenges that need to be addressed in 
the long run. What did our Democratic 
colleagues do? They blocked each and 
every one of these things without even 
taking the time to debate. 
Frankly, it is insulting to the mem-
ory of people like Mr. Floyd and others 
for whom so much empathy and sym-
pathy and concern was expressed that 
when the time comes to actually do 
something, they come to this empty- 
handed. 
For weeks, we have watched people of 
all races and cultures and backgrounds

marching and demanding action. They 
want to see greater transparency and 
accountability. 
They 
want 
better 
training and education for our police 
officers. They want to know that at the 
end of the day, the color of your skin 
will not determine the nature and out-
come of an interaction with a police of-
ficer. I agree with each of those points, 
and until this morning, I believed 
every Member of the Senate did as 
well. But the actions we have seen this 
morning 
blocking 
this 
legislation, 
stopping us from even debating the 
bill, offering amendments, trying to 
make it better—I guess I was giving 
our colleagues credit, which they clear-
ly do not deserve. 
The problems that led to the death of 
George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and 
other Black Americans have not gone 
away, but our Democratic colleagues 
have proven they are more interested 
in politics than solutions. 
Let the record reflect that this morn-
ing, the Senate had the opportunity to 
take the first step toward passing re-
forms that would begin to heal the di-
visions and distrust between law en-
forcement and the communities they 
served, and our Democratic colleagues 
unequivocally and shamelessly stood in 
the way. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss Re-
publicans’ 
historic 
record 
on 
con-
firming judges and why it matters to 
our country. It is because the rulings 
of these judges affect all Americans. 
The Republican-led Senate has seated 
President Trump’s highly qualified ju-
dicial nominees at lightning speed. 
These judges respect and uphold the 
rule of law. This week, the Senate 
marks a major milestone by con-
firming the 200th—200th—Trump judi-
cial nominee. 
The appeals court nominations and 
confirmations are especially critical. 
These are the circuit courts, and they 
rank right below the Supreme Court. 
Their decisions have a major impact on 
our Nation. With the confirmation of 
Cory Wilson to the Fifth Circuit, we 
have now filled all 53 appeals court va-
cancies that existed in the United 
States. There is not a single vacancy at 
that court level in America. 
We have changed the makeup of pow-
erful appeals courts like the Second, 
the Third, the Ninth, and the Eleventh 
circuits. Seven of the 12 U.S. circuit 
courts are now at a point where they 
have a majority of Republican-ap-
pointed judges. 
The 200 judges we have seated rep-
resent a sea change—a generational 
change in the Federal bench. I remind 
you that these are lifetime appoint-
ments, so they will decide cases for 
decades. 
Let me assure people who are tuning 
in today: These judges will apply the 
law as written. They will not legislate 
from the bench. We have had enough of 
that. Republicans are stemming this 
liberal judicial tide that we have lived 
with in the past. We are delivering on 
our promise to promote an independent 
judiciary. 
This concept is key to upholding our 
Constitution’s separation of powers 
and our system of checks and balances. 
Simply put, it is the glue holding our 
democracy together. 
The Constitution limits the power of 
the judiciary. Only Congress makes 
law, not the courts. That is not the 
way some courts like to operate. The 
courts interpret the law as a separate, 
coequal, and independent branch of 
government. That is what the Con-
stitution tells us. And the judges’ job is 
to follow the law, period. Yet, for dec-
ades, Democrats have hijacked the 
courts. They have sought to make 
their preferred policies through some-
thing known as judicial activism. 
Activist judges have used the bench 
to make liberal laws or interpret laws 
in a very liberal way. Rather than de-
cide cases impartially, liberal judges 
have a habit of favoring the left. The 
result has been a slew of radical re-
forms. These include promoting oner-
ous overregulation that hurt farmers 
and blocking the President’s efforts to 
secure the border. 
Republicans are replacing these lib-
eral activist judges with Trump-ap-
pointed constitutional conservatives. 
These judges are ruling right now all 
across the Nation. If you ask ‘‘How are 
they making a difference?’’ they are 
doing it by protecting our constitu-
tional rights, by safeguarding our indi-
vidual freedoms, and by checking un-
bridled government power. 
These judges are blocking Federal 
overreach. They are preventing Wash-
ington bureaucrats from inventing end-
less rules. They are upholding pro-life 
precedent and recognizing the right to 
school choice. They are defending the 
Second Amendment, securing the bor-
der, and protecting our First Amend-
ment rights, including free speech and 
religious liberty. 
Above 
all, 
Republican-appointed 
judges are applying the law as written; 
they are not making law from the 
bench. This has Democrats worried. 
You have seen it. You heard the com-
ments on the floor and around the Na-
tion. Democrats are worried they are 
losing control of the courts. 
Senator SCHUMER, the minority lead-
er, is so worried, in fact, that he even 
threatened harm to Supreme Court 
Justices who don’t rule his way. He re-
cently 
stood 
outside 
the 
Supreme 
Court, and he yelled at the court build-
ing and the Justices inside. He men-
tioned Justices by name and said: ‘‘You 
have released a whirlwind, and you will 
pay the price!’’ ‘‘You will pay the 
price!’’ This is how the left tends to op-
erate: intimidation. Do what we say, 
give us control, and then the intimida-
tion will stop. 
They are threatening the independ-
ence of the judiciary in other ways as 
well. Democrats have announced their 
plans to pack the Supreme Court. They 
have announced they will pack the 
Court with Justices friendlier to their 
causes. 
The standard we all know for the Su-
preme Court is nine Justices. In fact, it 
has been nine Justices since 1869—for 
over 150 years. Yet they want to change 
this longstanding precedent by actu-
ally increasing the number of Supreme 
Court Justices, taking it from 9 to 11. 
Some are proposing going to 13 if a 
Democrat is elected President and they 
have control of the Senate. 
Let 
us 
be 
clear: 
Court-packing 
amounts to deck-stacking by the far 
left. 
Democrats want to regain power, tip 
the scales of justice, and deliver their 
leftwing agenda any way they can. If 
Democrats win the election, as they 
have threatened, they will pack and 
stack the Court with impunity. 
The stakes in this upcoming election 
could not be higher. The next President 
will appoint maybe more than 60 cir-
cuit court judges and possibly another 
Supreme Court Justice. 
This is about ensuring justice. It is 
about ensuring fairness. It is about en-
suring freedom for all Americans. Re-
publicans, through today confirming 
our 200th judge to the courts, are stem-
ming this liberal judicial tide. We have 
delivered generational change on the 
bench. We must continue confirming 
well-qualified judges who will secure 
our freedoms and our future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 4049 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, on 
Tuesday night, Senator REED and I had 
the honor of filing S. 4049, the 60th an-
nual National Defense Authorization 
Act. Think about that—60 years. This 
is something we are always pretty con-
fident we will eventually get passed. To 
me, it is the most significant bill of the 
year, and we have been doing it now 
successfully for 60 years. It is what we 
consider every year, and we know it is 
going to pass because it has always 
passed, but it is also about taking care 
of our troops and defending our coun-
try. 
There is a document no one reads 
anymore. It is called the Constitution. 
It talks about what our primary re-
sponsibility is, which is to defend 
America. We are in a much more dan-
gerous position today than we have 
ever been before, so I think it is fitting 
that we are doing this ahead of the 
Fourth of July, our Nation’s birthday. 
We wouldn’t have our freedoms with-
out our men and women in uniform 
from the past and present, and that is

who we are dedicating this to. They are 
the beneficiaries of what we are doing 
as we are the beneficiaries of what they 
are doing. 
It is why we can all come together 
and finish this bill by next Thursday, I 
would still like to say, even though 
there is opposition to this. I say that 
because it would be the last day before 
the recess that is coming up, the 
Fourth of July, and I think it would be 
good if we could do it that way. There 
is a reason for that, but we are also re-
alistic, and we are not sure we are 
going to be able to do it, but we are 
going to make every effort to do it. 
One thing about working with my 
partner over here, Senator REED, is 
that we have always operated in a very 
cooperative manner, and we have sup-
ported each other. He answers to his 
Democratic friends, and we bring them 
together because of the relationship 
that we have on this committee. So I 
think there is always a possibility we 
can get this done. 
Both Senator REED and I would like 
to use an open amendment process. 
This is a process that would allow for 
all of our Members to come in and do 
what they have to do and do what they 
want to do with regard to things they 
want to have in the bill. We were not 
able to do that over the last couple of 
years because we had objections. 
One thing about the Senate is that 
everything operates on the basis of 
unanimous consent, so if we have 
someone who objects, we are unable to 
do it. Hopefully, that will not happen 
again this year, and we will be able to 
use the open amendment process. 
In having said that, it is not going to 
be nearly as significant this year be-
cause what we did in this year’s bill is 
to have actually made an appeal way 
back in February to our Democrats and 
Republicans, not just to those on the 
Armed Services Committee but to 
those in the entire Senate. This last 
February, we said: Start getting your 
amendments ready. Don’t wait until 
the last minute. Get them out there so 
we can talk about them and prepare 
them for ultimate votes. So people ac-
tually started. They were warned at 
that time that we didn’t want to wait 
until the last minute to do this. This is 
the first time we have been able to suc-
cessfully do this. 
Of all of the items that are in this 
bill—this bill that I consider to be the 
most significant of the year—40 per-
cent of the input came from our Mem-
bers of the Senate, and 40 percent of it 
came from the administration and the 
Pentagon, so that all of those things 
have already been treated once. Now, I 
have been around here long enough to 
remember when that 40 percent wasn’t 
40 percent—it was about 6 percent. We 
didn’t get the input of the Members 
like we do today. We just operated dif-
ferently at that time. This is the third 
year that I have been involved in this 
when we have been able to get a higher 
percentage of input from the Members. 
I think that is something that is work-
ing well, and it has already given the 
Members time to participate. 
I will put this a different way. The 
bill includes nearly 600 requests for 
amendments from the members of the 
Armed Services Committee and almost 
200 requests from Senators who are not 
on the committee. They are the ones 
who have put this bill together. With 
the Members’ input already in there, I 
am confident that we have a solid bill 
that reflects the needs we have and 
that it will not be as necessary to have 
more amendments since that is what 
we have already done. 
If we want to finish this bill by the 
end of next week, we will need to reach 
a unanimous consent agreement before 
this Friday. I understand there may be 
an objection to this that could happen, 
or there could be a change of mind. It 
is still my hope that this will take 
place. There is a reason for that, too, 
in that the House will be working on 
its bill right after we come back from 
the recess. We are just running out of 
time, so we need to get this started. 
We are putting in the managers’ 
package a bipartisan set of amend-
ments that we can all agree on. I ask 
all of our Members to get those in by 
this coming Friday. Even with that, it 
is going to be necessary for the staff to 
work all the way through the weekend 
to put it in position. We know we want 
to complete the first managers’ pack-
age, so the amendments will have to be 
filed. Keep in mind that Senator REED 
and I have that as a deadline for get-
ting those amendments in. 
In recent years, we have been able to 
consider many amendments on the 
floor. As I said earlier, I hope we will 
be able to do that again, and it may or 
may not happen. If a Member has an 
amendment and wants to debate it on 
the floor, we also need to know that 
the Member desires to have a debate so 
that we can work that in. 
Lastly, as Members are working 
through their amendments, please be 
thoughtful 
that 
we 
shouldn’t 
get 
bogged down with a lot of amendments 
that have nothing to do with national 
defense. This is the NDAA, the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. We 
should be talking about military. Yet 
one of the things that is characteristic 
about this is that, for as many years as 
I have been here and since this is the 
one bill that is going to be a must-pass 
bill and a must-pass bill this year, the 
people who were not able to get their 
bills in or amendments in on other bills 
wait until this comes along and try to 
do this with amendments. I am dis-
couraging that from happening, and I 
hope that it doesn’t happen. What is 
most important here is that we take 
care of our men and women in uniform. 
That is what it is all about. They are 
all volunteers, and they are deserving 
of our support. 
Again, my message to Members is to 
get their amendments filed as soon as 
possible. As I noted, this is the 60th an-
nual NDAA. For the last 59 years, Con-
gress has always passed an NDAA on a 
bipartisan basis. That is a big deal, and 
it is not a legacy we take lightly. I 
have been privileged to participate in 
this process as a member of the big 
four. I will tell you how that works. 
We do our bill, and the House does its 
bill. We go to conference, but we are 
still not able to get together, so they 
take the big four, which constitutes 
the ranking Democrat and Republican 
in the House and the ranking Democrat 
and Republican in the Senate, and the 
four of us sit down and get it done. We 
have done that several times in the 
past. It is the stopgap. It is the one last 
thing that we have to do if we are not 
able to do it any other way. 
Every year, we are told there are 
things we can’t accomplish. Every 
year, we are told there is no way we 
can find common ground. All of this 
happens, but, always, we do it, and our 
grand, bipartisan tradition continues 
just, as it will this year. The reason is 
simple: Failure and, worse, failure on 
the backs of our servicemembers is just 
not an option. 
While we are doing this, what I will 
remind everyone is that our military 
was hurt pretty badly under the pre-
vious administration. I always admired 
President Obama. He had a different 
agenda, and consequently we had some 
problems. I would say this: In the last 
5 years of his 8-year administration— 
that would be from 2010 to 2015—our de-
fense spending dropped by 25 percent. 
That has never happened before, and 
we have been working to rebuild since 
then. We are not quite there yet, but 
we have made great headway. It is easy 
to cut our military, to reduce readi-
ness, to slow down production, and all 
of that, but it is harder, not to mention 
slower and more costly, to rebuild it. 
That is what we are in the middle of 
right now. 
So that is what this is all about. It is 
a significant bill, and it is something 
we work on all year long. Then it 
comes time for it to come to the floor, 
which is where we are now. 
I have to say this: I can’t think of 
anyone I would rather have as a part-
ner than Senator REED. Senator REED 
and I have worked together for many 
years, and we have a way of getting 
along with each other and of coming to 
conclusions and the right decisions. It 
has been an honor for me over the 
years to have worked, as we are this 
year, with Senator REED. We are going 
to get a good bill done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
to join my colleague and chairman, 
Senator INHOFE, to discuss the fiscal 
year 2021 national defense authoriza-
tion bill. 
I begin by thanking Senator INHOFE 
for his leadership in ensuring that we 
had a bill to consider this year. This 
was an extraordinary year. Social 
distancing just began as the Armed 
Services Committee was finishing our 
hearings and getting ready to go into

June 24, 2020 
the markup for the national defense 
authorization bill. Despite the uncer-
tainty, the unusual challenges—the 
logistical challenges particularly—Sen-
ator INHOFE ensured that the bill was 
written and that the markup was held 
on schedule. He should be commended 
for this accomplishment. It is a tribute 
to his leadership, to his wisdom, to his 
common sense, and to his common de-
cency. 
So thank you for that, Mr. Chairman. 
I also want to take a moment to 
thank the staff. Both the chairman and 
I operate under the same rubric: They 
do the work, and we get the credit. It 
works for us—their work for us. They 
do a superb job. They found ways to 
draft the legislation. Yet they, too, 
were disrupted. Their work spaces were 
separated, and many had to work from 
home. So this has been an extraor-
dinary achievement, and it is a tribute 
to their commitment, to their profes-
sionalism, to their skill, and to their 
collaborative, bipartisan effort. I thank 
them for that. 
As the Senator, the chairman, has 
said and emphasized several times ‘‘bi-
partisanship.’’ This has been the hall-
mark of this legislation for many, 
many years. We recall colleagues, 
going back to John Warner and Sam 
Nunn and others, who had the attitude 
that ‘‘we have to work together.’’ 
Again, let me give the chairman credit 
for preserving that attitude, for insist-
ing upon that attitude, and for really 
getting, I think, the best out of the 
committee because of his example and 
of his setting a tone. 
We have differences in the bill, but 
we are strongly behind this effort. One 
of the things that I think we have been 
able to do is to figure out what might 
be a point of difference and that, if it 
comes to down to it, we take a vote, 
and we move on, and we get the bill 
done. That is what we did this time. We 
look forward to being on the floor and 
to 
doing 
the 
same 
thing—taking 
amendment proposals from our col-
leagues and trying to deal with them. 
If we can include them in the bill 
unanimously, that will be great. If we 
need a vote, I hope we can have debate 
and get a vote. 
We all understand that the bill pro-
vides the Defense Department with the 
resources it needs, particularly to en-
sure that the men and women who de-
fend us have the resources they need 
not only to fight the fight but, when 
they return, to have a quality of life 
with their families themselves that is 
in keeping with their sacrifice and 
their service. This bill does that. It 
also funds at the caps set under the re-
cently enacted Budget Control Act of 
about 2 years ago, so we are providing 
the much needed stability the Depart-
ment needs. It will include many items 
that benefit the families and military 
members, and I will go into those de-
tails later in our discussion. 
Now, 2 weeks ago, the committee 
took up the bill in the markup. Again, 
under the leadership of the chairman, 
we had a very good day of discussion 
and debate, and the bill was adopted by 
the committee with a strong bipartisan 
vote of 25 to 2. This legislation is com-
ing to the floor with overwhelming bi-
partisan support, and as the chairman 
indicated, one reason is that he solic-
ited the input of all of the members. 
We and our staff tried very vigorously 
to incorporate those proposals and 
ideas of all members, and at the end of 
the day, it was a strong, overwhelming 
vote. 
But even though we did consider, as 
the chairman said, hundreds of dif-
ferent proposals by members of the 
committee and Members of the Senate, 
there are still issues that will come be-
fore us. That is why, on the floor, I 
hope we will have, as the chairman in-
dicated, an open debate, that we will 
consider amendments—hopefully do so 
under reasonable time constraints so 
that we can get a lot done—and then, 
at the end of a vigorous debate, be able 
to vote for a bill that will advance the 
welfare of the men and women who 
serve and advance the common defense, 
which is our constitutional responsi-
bility. 
Again, I thank Senator INHOFE and 
look forward to the consideration of 
this bill. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let 
me just make one other comment. 
Senator REED talked about the staff 
and what the staff has done. When I 
talk to people back in Oklahoma about 
how hard a lot of these people work, 
they think of people in government as 
not caring to really spend the time and 
make the effort. 
I mentioned a minute ago that our 
staff is going to be working all this 
next weekend, and they have been 
working every weekend, that I can re-
member, to get this thing done. 
There are two people in particular— 
John Bonsell and Liz King. Liz King is 
the top adviser and manages things for 
Senator REED, and John Bonsell has 
done the same thing for me. He actu-
ally was my MLA many years ago. 
When you see how hard they work and 
their long hours—early in the morning 
until late at night and then on week-
ends—I just really want to say, not just 
of those two individuals but of the peo-
ple they have working for them, that I 
have never seen a harder working 
group. Their job, I guess—I say to my 
friend Senator REED—is to make us 
look good, but they are the ones who 
do the work. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING SISTER THOMAS WELDER 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor an influential and be-
loved North Dakotan, Sister Thomas 
Welder. 
I know the Presiding Officer knew 
her very well and just a little bit ago 
spoke about her here on the Senate 
floor, and that is so appropriate. She 
was such a wonderful person, and we 
both are so very fortunate to have 
known her and to have had time with 
her, to have learned much from her. 
She is truly somebody who I think 
epitomizes the term ‘‘servant leader.’’ 
Sister Thomas Welder was somebody 
who for me was a friend and a mentor 
in so many different ways, it is hard to 
recount, and also for my wife Mikey. 
Sister Thomas Welder dedicated her 
life to the University of Mary and the 
students, and my wife Mikey is on the 
board of trustees at the University of 
Mary, so Mikey and Sister Thomas 
worked together for many, many years 
and share an unbelievable bond as well. 
I am not even sure how long Mikey and 
I have known Sister Thomas; it has 
been many years. We have seen her in 
so many different capacities and so 
many different ways, but without fail, 
she was an inspiration—an inspiration 
for both of us and frankly an inspira-
tion for anybody who ever met her. She 
truly was one of the most exceptional, 
amazing, wonderful people I have ever 
met. She was certainly a person of in-
credible faith, and she lived her faith, 
and she provided that to others, cer-
tainly in her words but in her deeds 
and in her spirituality, in the way that 
she handled herself, in her spirit and 
compassion, and it affected everyone 
she met. Everyone she met felt that ra-
diant glow and reflected it back be-
cause it was so powerful within her. 
She was a member of the Benedict 
Sisters of Annunciation Monastery and 
faithfully lived the monastic life for 59 
years. 
From 1978 to 2009, she served as the 
president of the University of Mary and 
was, as I say, beloved by students and 
faculty. Under her leadership, the uni-
versity did amazing things. 
I think for a time the Presiding Offi-
cer worked there at the University of 
Mary during her tenure as president of 
the school. She grew the enrollment—I 
think tripled the enrollment. 
She was a gifted leader, an inspiring 
leader. She led by example. I think one 
of the most amazing things about her— 
a story you hear about over and over 
again; people marvel about it. When 
she originally came back after her 
schooling at the University of Mary, 
she taught music, but she eventually 
became president of the university. 
Even after she was president of the uni-
versity and Monsignor Shea became 
president of the university, she stayed 
and continued to work with the univer-
sity and the students. 
One of the amazing stories that peo-
ple would talk about and marvel at is 
how she would go on campus and she 
would meet all the students. So she got 
to know them all, thousands of stu-
dents. She knew all the faculty and ad-
ministrators and that kind of thing be-
cause they were there all the time. But

she would get to know all the students, 
and without fail, she would remember 
those 
students’ 
names. 
She 
went 
around the campus, and it wasn’t just 
‘‘Hi, how are you?’’ She knew the stu-
dents. She knew their names. She knew 
who they were. People would marvel 
not only that she was able to do that, 
but she never seemed to forget a name. 
You have to remember, there are thou-
sands of students, and they are there 
for a while, and they move on and more 
come in. 
It is one thing to know the faculty 
and administrators and those kinds of 
things and people who are there year in 
and year out, but think about the flow 
of students coming through, and to 
know them and know them by name— 
I think it is not only a testament to 
her but a testament to the University 
of Mary, where they really make those 
young people feel special and feel that 
they are an individual who is some-
body, who has worth. They are not just 
another student at the school; they are 
somebody special. She made them feel 
special because she knew them, she 
took time to talk to them. She always 
had time to talk to them. She had a lot 
of important things to do, but she al-
ways took time to talk to them and 
make them feel appreciated. 
When we think about sending our son 
or our daughter off to school, that is 
certainly something we would want, is 
when they go to that school, there is 
somebody there who says: You are an 
individual. You are unique. You are 
special. You are not just a number, but 
you are here, and I appreciate you, and 
I am here for you. 
That is what she did for those stu-
dents—not just when she was president 
but even after she retired as president. 
That is what she did because that is 
who she was. 
That is just one story, but that is 
part of her special gift—her special 
gift—and she gave it to everybody. She 
gave it to everybody. She gave that 
gift of her time, attention, compassion, 
and spirituality to everyone. I don’t 
know that I ever saw her in any setting 
where that wasn’t exactly what she 
was doing. That is why I say she did 
epitomize that concept of servant lead-
ership. 
As Governor, I was privileged and 
honored to award Sister Thomas the 
Theodore 
Roosevelt 
Rough 
Rider 
Award. That is our highest recognition 
in North Dakota. That is the highest 
award we give. As part of it, we then 
hang the individual’s portrait in our 
State capitol, and along with the por-
trait, there is also kind of a bio that is 
right there so that people going to the 
North Dakota State Capitol can see the 
people from across our State who are 
inspirational leaders. The pictures are 
a montage, so that you put up things in 
their life. 
In the case for Sister Thomas, she 
went to the University of Mary there, 
and they can see and get a visual sense 
of what the person looked like, the im-
portant things they did, and then we 
have a bio that goes with it. 
I am going to reference just a couple 
of the lines we have in the bio we put 
in there: 
Sister Thomas is recognized as a woman 
who lives, serves, and leads by example. Her 
personal achievements, character, and lead-
ership have been an inspiration to countless 
individuals, students, entrepreneurs, and 
business and state leaders. Envisioning the 
University of Mary as the Nation’s premier 
institution for the preparation of servant 
leaders, 
Sister 
Thomas 
promotes 
com-
petence, communication, commitment to 
values, and service to community. Her 
strong belief in the ability of an individual 
to go into leadership through service is an 
example for North Dakota and the nation. 
There is a lot more, but those were 
some of the things we put in there to 
try to capture who she was, what she 
did, and what a difference she made in 
the lives of so many. 
As I say, I don’t know that I ever met 
anyone who didn’t immediately like 
her, but it was more than that. I mean, 
there are a lot of people who are like-
able, affable, and amiable. She was all 
of that. She was very, very likeable. 
She had a great smile, good wit, and 
good humor. She was a really good 
speaker. She was always very prepared, 
always had a good message, and was 
well-spoken, but she had a great smile 
and a ready laugh, and she imme-
diately made people feel comfortable. 
You could see how she would lean in 
and gaze in on them and just start to 
say: Tell me about you. Give me some 
of what you are, A little bit of what is 
your spirit, what moves you, what 
makes you. What are you interested 
in? What do you like? How are you feel-
ing? 
She just did it naturally. 
I just, again, can’t think of anybody 
who ever met her and didn’t come away 
saying: You know, I like her, but she is 
special. She made me feel good. She 
made me feel good. She seemed inter-
ested in me. She is genuine. She cares. 
She made an impact on me. 
They remember her, and it was posi-
tive, and it was strong. 
Mikey and I extend our deepest con-
dolences to her loved ones, and when I 
say her family, she had a huge family 
because everybody she met was basi-
cally her family, all those kids and all 
those students. We want to express our 
sincere appreciation for her lifetime of 
service and her commitment to her 
community and her commitment to 
God. Sister Thomas was patient, Sister 
Thomas was wonderful, Sister Thomas 
was beloved, and Sister Thomas will be 
missed very, very much. God bless her. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle voted to block consider-
ation of the JUSTICE bill. This hap-
pened to be the first major piece of po-
lice reform legislation in years. 
To be clear, this vote wasn’t a vote 
to pass the bill in the Senate. It wasn’t 
even a vote to limit debate on police 
reform. It was a vote on whether we 
could simply begin debate on police re-
form. 
We are standing now on the floor of 
what is called the world’s greatest de-
liberative body, the U.S. Senate. Yet 
my 
colleagues 
on 
the 
other 
side 
wouldn’t even entertain a debate on an 
issue that has stirred our Nation and 
shaken it to its core. 
We know why we are here. There was 
a murder of a citizen in Minneapolis— 
George Floyd. There have been peace-
ful demonstrations all over the country 
since then, and Congress’s time to re-
spond probably—probably should have 
responded years ago, but this has 
brought to a head that we need police 
reform. 
Yes, we are in the world’s greatest 
deliberative body, we are told. The 
Senate’s legacy and prestige are built 
on our ability to debate and discuss 
legislation, to address the most press-
ing issues before our country. My col-
leagues on the other side have robbed 
the American people of the opportunity 
to pass meaningful police reform. 
On the other side, they argue that 
the JUSTICE Act doesn’t go far enough 
and that their version of police reform 
is the only bill worth considering. All 
the brains in the U.S. Senate are on 
the other side of the aisle, is more or 
less what they are saying. I want to re-
mind them that we live in a country 
with diverse ideas and varying opin-
ions. Debating those differences is the 
only way to make meaningful reform. 
Democrats complain that their views 
weren’t represented in this bill. Well, 
the JUSTICE Act contains a number of 
proposals that actually have bipartisan 
support. Even if that wasn’t enough for 
them, every Democrat would still have 
an opportunity to make additional 
changes. 
On our side, Senator TIM SCOTT of 
South Carolina led this effort for all of 
us. Forty-six of us are joining him. I 
hope the other seven will join in as 
well. But that is just Republicans, and 
this is a bipartisan bill—presumably 
not bipartisan enough to satisfy the 
other side but still bipartisan—and 
they wouldn’t let us move ahead. 
Senator SCOTT made clear when the 
bill was introduced last week that he 
was interested and willing to discuss 
changes. Leader MCCONNELL pledged an 
open amendment process. Even Speak-
er PELOSI noted that she welcomed the 
opportunity to conference the Demo-
cratic House police reform bill with 
Senator SCOTT’s JUSTICE Act. 
Instead of letting our time-honored 
legislative process work, my colleagues 
sent a letter calling the JUSTICE Act 
‘‘unsalvageable.’’ 
Let’s 
remember— 
these are the same Senators who in-
sisted that the Senate consider a police 
reform bill before the July recess, 
which starts next week. Now that they 
are getting what they asked for, they 
say they don’t want it anymore—at 
least that is what their vote tells me 
today. 
My question is, What are they afraid 
of? Are they afraid of losing control of

June 24, 2020 
the process if it goes to a vote? Well, 
then, they are afraid of democracy. 
They are afraid of the American people 
who elected each Senator in this body 
and trusts each Senator to represent 
them by voting on legislation. 
Are they afraid that their ideas won’t 
be adopted? The JUSTICE Act has 
many similarities to the Justice in Po-
licing Act. We want to find a way for-
ward on a bipartisan basis. If ideas 
have merit, they will have to be voted 
on and be included. 
Are they somehow afraid that if we 
make progress, it will be perceived as 
giving the President and his party a 
win? I have been around here long 
enough to know that in an election 
year, it gets harder and harder to get 
things done because neither party 
wants the other to get any credit for 
anything or have an advantage. But on 
an issue as important as this, it is the 
height of cynicism and hypocrisy to 
prevent progress to gain political ad-
vantage. 
I am reminded of a Scripture: ‘‘For 
what shall it profit a man if he shall 
gain the whole world but lose his 
soul?’’ 
The American people expect better. I 
know that my fellow Iowans expect 
better. Frankly, I expect better as well. 
I hope my colleagues reconsider their 
obstruction and let us get on with 
crafting a bipartisan police reform bill. 
I know my colleagues on the other side 
share our desire to deliver for our con-
stituents. I don’t doubt their sincerity 
about wanting to address inequities in 
the communities or unfairness in polic-
ing. I don’t doubt they would have had 
legitimate ideas on how to improve 
this legislation if it had come before 
the Senate. But at the very least, we 
can’t accomplish any of those things 
unless we start debate. 
We have done it before on other 
issues. Only 18 months ago, this Cham-
ber passed the FIRST STEP Act, the 
most significant criminal justice re-
form bill in a generation. That was a 
strong bipartisan bill. It wasn’t easy, 
but Senator DURBIN and I and Demo-
crats and other Republicans in addition 
to the two of us found a path forward 
and are giving thousands of Americans 
a chance to improve their lives when 
they leave prison. 
I am frustrated that the Senate can’t 
consider this JUSTICE Act, but I 
promise Iowans and the American peo-
ple that this partisan exercise doesn’t 
represent my last hope for meaningful 
change. I stand ready to work with any 
Democrat or any Republican on the 
issue of police reform, and, for sure, I 
am not alone in the willingness to do 
that. 
In fact, at the Judiciary Committee, 
just last week, the issue was police use 
of force and community relations. At 
that meeting, Chairman GRAHAM indi-
cated that he wants to hold more hear-
ings on this issue. 
So I urge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle not to let today’s vote be 
the end of the story. There is and has 
been 
an 
evergreen 
issue. 
George 
Floyd’s murder was the spark that ig-
nited a national outcry. We must rise 
to the occasion. We cannot let elec-
tion-year politics and differences of 
opinion prevent us from even dis-
cussing how best to improve justice 
and safety in our community. 
FLYNN INVESTIGATION 
Mr. President, I will speak just a 
short period of time on another issue 
that was resolved today by the DC Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals. Finally, justice 
has been done to a person that has been 
very unjustly treated, a person by the 
name of Lieutenant General Flynn, 
who served this country 33 years in the 
military. 
Today, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia ordered the 
district court to grant the govern-
ment’s motion to dismiss the Flynn 
case. Remember, this has been going on 
for almost 4 years. 
I am pleased the appeals court upheld 
what it rightfully called ‘‘clearly es-
tablished legal principles.’’ The appeals 
court said that the first ‘‘troubling in-
dication’’ of the district judge’s ‘‘mis-
taken understanding’’ of his role was 
to appoint a former judge, and now a 
private citizen, to argue against the 
government’s 
proposal 
to 
District 
Judge Sullivan to dismiss the Flynn 
case. Remember, the reason for that 
was that he was mistreated in the first 
place. 
As the majority opinion said: ‘‘The 
court has appointed one private citizen 
to argue that another citizen should be 
deprived of his liberty regardless of 
whether the Executive Branch is will-
ing to pursue those charges.’’ 
The DC Circuit is ordering an end to 
this charade, and let Lieutenant Gen-
eral Flynn get back to his life and his 
family. Remember, this is a case where 
we set up—and you saw the emails 
from people that were going to pros-
ecute him. Is this to get him fired—to 
get Flynn fired? Or is it to get him 
prosecuted? That is how open it was, 
but we didn’t know about that until a 
few months ago. 
So, today, Flynn’s legal team re-
leased Strzok’s notes regarding a meet-
ing between Obama, Biden, Comey, 
Sally Yates, and Susan Rice. These 
notes appear to show several important 
things. The first one is, Comey said the 
Flynn calls with the Russian Ambas-
sador ‘‘appear legit.’’ Two, President 
Obama ordered Comey to ‘‘look at 
things.’’ Three, President Obama di-
rected that ‘‘the right people’’ inves-
tigate Flynn. Four, Vice President 
Biden appeared to raise the Logan Act. 
Those four things lead to these ques-
tions. Well, if it was legit, then, why 
‘‘look at things’’? If it was legit, why 
would Biden mention the Logan Act? 
These notes raise legitimate questions. 
For example, did President Obama and 
Vice President Biden deliberately take 
steps in the final hours of their admin-
istration to undermine the incoming 
administration? It sure looks like that 
is what they were up to. 
It also is reasonable to question the 
extent of President Obama’s and Vice 
President 
Biden’s 
knowledge 
about 
Russia and the Flynn investigation. I 
give this to you as an example. We 
know that on January 4, 2017, the same 
day that Strzok allegedly wrote the 
meeting notes, the FBI wrote a closing 
memorandum on Flynn, who was code 
named ‘‘Crossfire Razor’’ by the FBI, 
that said the intelligence community 
could find no derogatory information 
on him. 
So they couldn’t find any derogatory 
information on him, a person who had 
served in the military for 33 years, got 
out as a lieutenant general, and was 
going to be the National Security Advi-
sor for this new administration. They 
could find no derogatory information, 
but for the next 31⁄2 years, he has been 
fighting for his freedom. Then, on that 
very same day, January 4, 2017, the FBI 
was ready to close this Flynn case— 
probably based on the fact that Comey 
said that all this connection between 
Flynn and the Russian ambassador was 
probably legit. 
But that doesn’t matter to somebody 
by the name of Strzok, who was kind of 
leading all of this. He asked another 
FBI agent: ‘‘Hey if you haven’t closed 
Razor don’t do it yet.’’ The case was 
still open at the moment and Strzok 
asked that it be kept open ‘‘for now.’’ 
Strzok then messaged his lover, Lisa 
Page, saying that Razor still happened 
to be open because of some oversight 
and said to her—I don’t know whether 
this is tongue in cheek or whether it 
was real serious, but he said: ‘‘Yeah, 
our utter incompetence actually helps 
us. . . . ’’ 
So what is helping us? It seems like 
any excuse to keep going in getting 
Flynn. At that point, we all know the 
case should have been closed, but 31⁄2 
years later, it is just solved by a deci-
sion of the DC Court of Appeals. So, in-
stead, even in light of Comey appar-
ently saying that the calls between 
Flynn and the Russian Ambassador ap-
pear 
legit, 
President 
Obama—still 
President of the United States—di-
rected Comey to ‘‘look at things’’ and 
make sure ‘‘the right people’’ inves-
tigate it. 
That has kind of been questionable, 
the extent to which President Obama 
was involved in this, but it seems like 
those quotes make it pretty clear. And 
then, at this very same conversation, 
Vice President Biden chimed in as well 
by bringing up the Logan Act, which 
was used as a pretext to interview 
Flynn weeks later. Mind you, all of 
this happened after the election. Now 
people are raising questions about: 
Why are you worried about things that 
happened 3 years ago? An injustice was 
done to Flynn, and if you let people 
run wild over the freedoms and lib-
erties of the American people, if it can 
happen to a lieutenant general, it can 
happen to anybody else, and we saw it 
happen to George Floyd. He was mur-
dered because of justice and the con-
stitutional rights of people not being 
followed.

So then we have the incoming Trump 
administration and all this going on, 
having no idea that Obama, Biden, 
Comey, and Strzok were busy setting 
the stage for what would become a 
multiyear struggle to show that Trump 
didn’t collude with the Russian Gov-
ernment—so much for a peaceful tran-
sition of power from one President to 
another and from one political party to 
another. It was something that for 240 
years we prided ourselves in, but not in 
this case. Ever since the election, No-
vember of 2016, think of all the things 
that have been done to get Trump out 
of office, and it started even before he 
was sworn in. 
Well, thankfully, the DC Circuit 
stepped in to restore a bit of justice 
after the government’s multiyear cam-
paign to destroy Flynn’s reputation. 
The FBI and the Department of Jus-
tice’s actions to frame an American 
citizen, drag that citizen into court, 
setting him up to plead guilty to lying, 
and then doing everything they can to 
cover up their transgressions should 
never happen and should never have 
happened either. Let’s all hope it never 
happens again. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PENSION REFORM 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here to talk about a complicated but 
really important issue, and it is one 
that Congress and the administration 
needs to address before it results in a 
devastating financial impact on mil-
lions of retirees, raises costs to thou-
sands of businesses, some of which are 
going to go insolvent—bankrupt—un-
less it is dealt with, and an issue that 
can harm the overall economy if it is 
not dealt with. 
The Presiding Officer has been very 
involved in this issue, and I hope oth-
ers will bear with me as we talk about 
it, because it is complicated, but it is 
really important. I am talking about 
multiemployer pension reform, and as 
anyone who is working on this problem 
can tell you, it is something that we 
cannot ignore. 
Briefly, 
a 
multiemployer 
pension 
plan consists of multiple different com-
panies. Usually, employees in a single 
union pool their assets together, and 
they provide a defined benefit pen-
sion—the old-style pensions, a guaran-
teed pension, so-called—to cover work-
ers and retirees. These plans are joint-
ly administered, then, between the 
unions and the employers as trustees, 
who determine the benefits and the em-
ployer contributions based on the col-
lective bargaining process and subject 
to whatever statutory funding require-
ments there are that we provide here in 
the U.S. Congress and through law. 
It is a system of a lot of different em-
ployers coming together and providing 
a pension under one union typically. 
This system now comprises over 1,400 
plans covering 10.8 million participants 
and their families. Unfortunately, it is 
on the verge of collapse. The system is 
underfunded by more than $638 billion, 
and that figure has probably increased 
significantly due to the coronavirus 
epidemic and the resulting impact on 
the economy. 
On top of that, there is the Federal 
entity that ensures these pensions. 
Pensions are sort of a guaranteed ben-
efit, so-called, but they are guaranteed 
in a sense because they are insured by 
a Federal entity called the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation. That 
PBGC for the multiemployer program 
is projected to become insolvent in less 
than 5 years. Over 1.4 million workers 
and retirees are in plans already in 
what is called ‘‘critical and declining 
status,’’ meaning they are facing ben-
efit cuts of over 90 percent. So that is 
the problem. 
This chart can sort of show it to you 
here. These are the assets at the start 
of the year—2019, 2020, 2021—and this is 
what happens. The assets go down. The 
liabilities go up. This is the financial 
assistance provided to the various 
plans. So, as you can see, the green is 
only going to last until 2025. And, 
again, with the new economic numbers, 
that will be exhausted even before 
that, which creates a real problem for 
those plan participants or retirees, for 
the companies that are going to have 
huge new liabilities—and some of them 
will not be able to handle it and will 
not be able to stay in business—and for 
our economy, because that will then 
have a contagion impact on the entire 
economy. 
So those workers who are expecting 
to have the benefit because they are 
still working and those retirees who 
are facing these cuts are looking to us 
to come up with a bipartisan solution 
to address this crisis that faces the 
multiemployer pension system and the 
PBGC. They are counting on us to put 
in place commonsense reforms to en-
sure that these hard-earned pension 
benefits will be there for workers and 
retirees during their retirement. 
A lot of these workers will tell you 
that they didn’t take the pay increases 
or they didn’t take the healthcare ben-
efits the size they wanted in their col-
lective bargaining because they bar-
gained for this, which was the hope of 
having a pension—a guaranteed, de-
fined benefit pension—and now they 
are seeing the possibility that that 
could result in a 90-percent cut in their 
benefits. 
Over the past several years we have 
been working on this, I have been in-
volved with it. I have been working on 
the Finance Committee, which is the 
committee here in the Senate that has 
responsibility for this issue. 
In 2018—so going back 2 years ago 
now—I was participating in hearings as 
a member of the Joint Select Com-
mittee on Solvency of Multiemployer 
Pension Plans. It was a 1-year com-
mittee. It was House and Senate, Re-
publican and Democrat. We were sup-
posed to get to a solution for this prob-
lem before it gets worse, and we spent 
countless hours trying to do that. I 
spent countless hours in meetings with 
beneficiaries, 
retirees, 
spouses 
of 
theirs. 
Ohio was one of the States hardest 
hit. I have heard their stories about 
how years of mismanaged pension 
plans have put them on the hook for 
unthinkable cuts in the pensions they 
just assumed were going to be there. 
Let me spell out how precarious this 
is for my home State of Ohio. We have 
over 60,000 active workers and retirees 
in multiemployer pension plans at im-
mediate risk of becoming insolvent— 
probably more than any other State in 
the country. Many of these Ohio plans 
have already been forced to drastically 
reduce benefits, by the way, including 
the Iron Workers Local 17 Plan in 
Cleveland, the Southwest Ohio Re-
gional Council of Carpenters Pension 
Plan, and the Toledo Roofers Local 134 
Pension Plan. 
Some are already insolvent, like the 
Teamsters Local 116 of Cleveland Pen-
sion Fund, so for some, unfortunately, 
this insolvency has already happened. 
The Central States Pension Fund, 
which is the single largest plan that is 
in this critical and declining status, is 
projected to become insolvent in 2025— 
the same time the PBGC is because 
when it goes under, PBGC goes under; 
it is that big. They have 44,000 partici-
pants in that plan in Ohio—again, more 
than any other State. The majority of 
Central States’ retirees are veterans, 
by the way, according to the National 
United Committee to Protect Pensions. 
They receive about $360 million in an-
nual benefits from their pensions. By 
the way, that money goes right back 
into the economy. They spend it. 
Unfortunately, years of bad Federal 
policy with respect to funding and 
withdrawal liability rules, losses on 
risky investments, and failure to take 
proactive action have brought many of 
these pension plans to the brink of in-
solvency. The result is that these hard- 
working Ohioans in Central States face 
pension cuts of over 90 percent if no ac-
tion is taken. That is unacceptable. We 
can’t let that happen. 
By the way, it is not just a retire-
ment security issue, as I said earlier; it 
is a jobs issue. The multiemployer pen-
sion 
system 
consists 
primarily 
of 
smaller businesses that face uncer-
tainty and a higher cost of doing busi-
ness due to the liability they will face 
called withdrawal liability. 
More than 200 small businesses are in 
Central States alone in my home State 
of Ohio—200 businesses that face huge 
withdrawal liabilities, many of which 
are much bigger than the book value of 
the company, meaning, of course, that 
they are not going to make it.

In fact, if a systemically important 
plan like Central States were to be-
come insolvent, contributing employ-
ers face the risk of being assessed un-
planned withdrawal liabilities that will 
result in a wave of bankruptcies and a 
contagion effect across the economy as 
plans with overlapping contribution 
bases also fail. It will not just be that 
plan; it will be other plans as well be-
cause the companies pay into different 
plans. 
Even if they are not assessed with-
drawal liability, employers will be 
forced then to make contributions into 
an insolvent plan, making those com-
panies not competitive in the labor 
market. They will not be able to pay 
their employees as much because they 
are making the payments into the in-
solvent plans. 
These jobs are essential to our econ-
omy—right now, more than ever. Many 
of the current workers in the Central 
States Pension Fund, as an example, 
are truckdrivers, and these are the 
very truckdrivers who are keeping our 
grocery stores stocked. They are the 
supply 
lines 
running 
through 
this 
coronavirus crisis. They have put their 
health on the line for all of us, and we 
need to do our very best to ensure that 
the pensions they have earned—rightly 
earned—will be there for them. 
While 
these 
problems 
were 
well 
known before the current economic 
downturn, this slowdown is only going 
to accelerate the crisis. As CBO pro-
jected in late April—that is, the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office— 
the second quarter of this fiscal year is 
projected to mark the largest percent-
age drop in economic output in re-
corded history, with the GDP projected 
to fall 40 percent on an annualized 
basis. That has a real impact on these 
pensions. 
As chair of the Senate Finance sub-
committee with jurisdiction over these 
multiemployer pension plans, I have 
been working on this issue with Demo-
crats and Republicans alike, and I be-
lieve a balanced, pro-growth solution 
to the problem is possible. I also know 
that it is needed. 
As bad as the pension crisis is for 
these retirees we talked about and for 
their individual plans, it also has a 
broader impact on our economy, so all 
of us should be interested in solving 
this problem. 
It will not be easy, especially given 
the unprecedented health crisis we now 
face, but putting off this difficult work 
today means greater costs tomorrow. 
The costs compound, so it gets worse. 
The multiemployer program deficit 
is projected to rise significantly if we 
wait until this period—around 2024 or 
2025. Even if we didn’t have this pan-
demic, this is an issue we owe to our 
constituents to take proactive action 
on. 
We have come some way on this 
project, 
and 
we 
have 
made 
some 
progress over time. In 2018, Senator 
SHERROD BROWN and his co-chair Sen-
ator Orrin Hatch and I put together a 
framework for reform while serving on 
this Joint Select Committee on Sol-
vency of Multiemployer Pension Plans. 
I think that framework can effectively 
address the crisis. We called it the bi-
partisan framework. It would have pro-
vided PBGC enough resources to pre-
vent its own insolvency and put in 
place structural reforms to the funding 
rules and the way plans are governed 
to ensure a long-term solution going 
forward. 
Unfortunately, the joint committee 
was not able to reach final agreement 
on these reforms, and therefore we 
weren’t able to stabilize the PBGC and 
put it on a stronger financial footing. 
But I strongly believe that the mecha-
nism to address the immediate crisis 
that is in this bipartisan framework 
still offers the right way forward for us 
to get this done. In fact, I am pleased 
there is a renewed interest in address-
ing this crisis using this framework 
right now. 
The House-passed HEROES Act—that 
is, the legislation the House passed to 
deal with the COVID–19 crisis—includes 
a proposal to try to fix this problem. 
Again, it is a step in the right direction 
in that they have chosen to adopt the 
approach of partitioning at-risk plans 
to help address the immediate crisis. 
That is the approach we took. 
This is a step away from their pre-
vious plan in the House and among a 
lot of Democrats in the Senate, which 
employed a loan structure for all inac-
tive liabilities and, based on CBO anal-
ysis, would not have prevented PBGC 
from becoming insolvent. So this new 
structure makes more sense, and it is 
closer to the Senate bipartisan frame-
work. The new House plan, therefore, 
costs a little less, and retirees also get 
more certainty from it. 
There are some flaws in the House 
Democrats’ approach that still make it 
a nonstarter over here in the Senate. 
First, there is no shared responsi-
bility when it comes to strengthening 
the financial condition of the PBGC. It 
entirely relies on taxpayers—so $59 bil-
lion of taxpayer funds over the next 10 
years. Some on our side of the aisle, of 
course, find that to be a bailout by the 
taxpayers when, in fact, there ought to 
be more shared responsibility. This is 
particularly important now as there is 
more and more concern about the pub-
lic money that is being spent. 
Second, the House proposal includes 
no structural reforms whatsoever to 
the rules governing how multiemployer 
pension plans operate, how employer 
contributions are determined, and cor-
rective actions that trustees can take 
to improve plan solvency and protect 
the participants. 
What we don’t want to do is solve the 
problem with a bandaid and then have 
the problem come right back again. We 
want to get this right. The reforms 
have to address the underlying flaws in 
the system and ensure that PBGC can 
function as a self-sustaining entity 
rather than a new line item in the Fed-
eral budget funded by permanent enti-
tlement spending. This has to be some-
thing that solves the program long 
term. We can’t put in place a partial 
solution that will require Congress to 
come back again and again in the fu-
ture. Unfortunately, the House Demo-
crats’ plan fails to achieve this. 
In my view, any plan we make to re-
form the multiemployer pension sys-
tem has to adhere to three main prin-
ciples: 
No. 1, we do need shared responsi-
bility to address the immediate crisis. 
We should not pass a legislative solu-
tion where the bill is entirely footed by 
taxpayers. Employers and participants 
must share the responsibility of fixing 
this 
problem—not 
taxpayers 
alone 
since 99 percent of taxpayers aren’t 
participating in this system. 
A recent poll by McLaughlin & Asso-
ciates of 2,700 likely voters in Mid-
western States found that 76 percent of 
voters support a shared solution based 
on a combination of financial contribu-
tions from employers, retirees, and 
taxpayers. 
A Congressional Budget Office 2017 
working group paper found that both 
various exemptions from government 
employer contributions and accounting 
standards used by multiemployer plans 
played significant roles in allowing 
PBGC to become insolvent. So both ex-
emptions from the employers putting 
money in and the accounting standards 
are the reason, they say, that PBGC be-
came underfunded. So greater em-
ployer contributions are part of getting 
these plans back on track. 
Second, I believe any solution must 
ensure sustainable solvency for the 
PBGC. Again, this is important to be 
sure that we are solving this problem. 
Overall, I believe premiums should be a 
significant contributor to the health of 
PBGC, covering at least half of the cost 
of recapitalization. 
We also need our plan participants to 
pitch in, in the form of solvency fees 
paid directly to PBGC. With a signifi-
cant variable-rate premium, by the 
way, we can make these solvency fees 
as low as 10 percent or maybe even 
lower. We need to think long and hard 
about the levels of shared responsi-
bility that could include premiums im-
posed on workers, on unions, and in-
creased flat-rate premiums as well. 
These would be small contributions but 
significant in the sense that everybody 
would 
be 
participating, 
everybody 
would do a little bit, and the taxpayers 
would be asked to do a lot too. But the 
only way we can get the taxpayers to 
make a substantial contribution is to 
ensure that there is this shared respon-
sibility. 
Third, any solution must ensure 
there is sustainable solvency for the 
multiemployer plans in the future. Any 
bipartisan 
solution 
should 
include 
structural reform to the funding rules 
governing employer contributions to 
multiemployer plans so that Congress 
and the Treasury will not be regularly 
called upon to bail out a large number 
of underfunded plans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3199 
June 24, 2020 
Retirees need to know these plans 
are secure. This includes gradually 
phasing down the rate at which plans 
may value existing pension liabilities, 
which are promises to retirees that 
should be kept but are being budgeted 
for through investments that the Con-
gressional Budget Office says are high 
risk. Without any rules on how these 
pension liabilities are valued, there is 
high risk. Here is what the risk is now. 
Here is the average multiemployer 
plan target rate of return. Here is a 
conservative way to look at it, which 
would be the interest rate on 10-year 
Treasuries. 
By the way, the 10-year Treasury is 
now down to just about 1 percent, so it 
has gone down even further. This gap is 
that high risk the Congressional Budg-
et Office is talking about. So there 
needs to be some solution here. 
I understand that this needs to be 
phased in. It needs to be gradual. It 
needs to be reasonable. But we have to, 
again, ensure that retirees know that, 
when they get into a plan and make 
contributions to a plan, it is going to 
be there for them. 
The Senate Finance Committee pub-
lished its own proposal in November 
which attempted to get at these two 
goals of addressing the immediate cri-
sis through shared responsibility and 
preventing a future crisis through re-
forms to the funding rules. This was a 
Republican plan put forward by Sen-
ator GRASSLEY, who spoke moments 
ago. That proposal was called the Mul-
tiemployer Pension Recapitalization 
Reform Plan. It is not perfect, but it is 
worth emphasizing that the Trump ad-
ministration supports this proposal 
and put out a Statement of Adminis-
tration Policy endorsing it, saying: 
‘‘We believe it has the potential to 
serve as the base for a long-term solu-
tion to the multiemployer pension cri-
sis.’’ I have talked to several people 
within the administration, and I think 
they are also committed to a bipar-
tisan agreement in this Congress to try 
to solve this problem. 
Again, the plan put out by Senator 
GRASSLEY and also Senator ALEXANDER 
may not be perfect, but now you have 
two plans out there, both of which use 
the same basic structure, and I think 
there is an opportunity here for us to 
come together. 
Right now, I know some of my coun-
terparts in the House who have worked 
on the multiemployer pension proposal 
in the HEROES Act want to know 
whom they should be negotiating with 
because they are not negotiating right 
now on how to find that compromise. I 
would suggest talking to the Finance 
Committee. That is where the jurisdic-
tion is. That is what the administra-
tion has indicated as well. 
We have been working all year with 
the PBGC on a reasonable proposal 
that we believe can get support from 
the National United Committee to Pro-
tect Pensions, many of the Teamsters 
local unions, and many employers who 
are trying to stay afloat right now. 
The Senate Finance Committee will 
continue to reach out to have a serious 
conversation with Democrats on both 
sides of the Capitol to help address this 
immediate crisis and ensure sustain-
able solvency for the multiemployer 
pension system. In order to reach an 
agreement on this issue, shared respon-
sibility will be necessary to make it 
work, in my view. 
To reiterate, we are willing to put se-
rious Federal money on the table—tax-
payer funds—and we are willing to ne-
gotiate, but it has to be a balanced ap-
proach. 
The time to act is now. The Senate 
Finance Committee has this common-
sense proposal on the Republican side— 
again, vetted by PBGC—that, while not 
perfect, is an interesting starting point 
for us to come together. The House has 
their own proposal that has many simi-
larities in terms of its structure. So 
let’s build upon those, as Republicans 
and Democrats, to ensure we can get 
our 
multiemployer 
pension 
system 
back in working order. We owe it to 
the retirees. We owe it to the workers, 
to the participants in these plans. We 
owe it to these small businesses. Let’s 
get serious about this and ensure we 
can protect the retirements of hard- 
working Americans we represent. Tax-
payers deserve proactive action now, 
and so do workers and so do retirees. 
Let’s get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, nearly 
a month has passed since George Floyd 
died. In a show of unity, which bridged 
divides 
Americans—Republicans, 
Democrats, 
Independents—demanded 
that something be done to prevent such 
deaths from happening in the future. 
Republicans are trying to do some-
thing. 
Thanks to the leadership of Senator 
TIM SCOTT, the Senate is trying to con-
sider the JUSTICE Act, a major bill to 
reform police departments in meaning-
ful, practical ways; yet today, Demo-
crats blocked consideration of the bill. 
I hope Democrats allow the Senate to 
at least debate the JUSTICE Act. If 
Democrats don’t like the bill, offer an 
amendment. Make the case. Reforming 
police departments, making justice 
fair, and equal for all is a bipartisan 
issue. 
I smiled when I was sitting in the 
Chair where you are right now, Mr. 
President, when a Senate colleague, 
who is a Democrat, spoke yesterday 
and described the Senate as the world’s 
greatest deliberative body. I thought 
she must be sarcastic. I say that be-
cause Democrats refuse to allow delib-
eration. The people sent us here to 
solve problems. Let’s do the work. 
As I was sitting in the Chair yester-
day, I heard Democrats rationalize why 
they refuse to allow debate. As best as 
I can tell, they refused to allow any de-
liberation because they are not sure 
that what they want to be included 
will be included. 
I think now it is time to review that 
which most of us learned in fifth grade. 
Just for a civics lesson for my Demo-
cratic colleagues, I am going to go 
through how a bill is passed and to 
show that, even though they don’t like 
how the bill starts, they can actually 
change how it ends and vote against it 
if they don’t like it. 
We all learned this. This is how a bill 
is passed. We get an idea from a con-
stituent. Those ideas are on the street 
right now. They want reform of how 
policing occurs, to make sure that it is 
fair and equitable for all. The bill can 
go through the House. It is debated on 
the House floor. If it is approved, it 
comes to the Senate. 
I am going to interject here. The 
Senate may come up with its own bill, 
and it goes to the floor. Here, it says 
the bill is debated. That is not hap-
pening. Filibuster and cloture may 
occur, and the Senate may approve the 
bill. 
Let’s stop here. If the Democratic 
Senators don’t like the bill in its cur-
rent form, they can amend it. If they 
don’t like the way it is when it is 
amended, they can vote against it. If 
they vote against it, it will not pass. If 
they don’t like where it ends up, after 
we deliberate, debate, and offer amend-
ments, they can still defeat it. 
Let’s just imagine that it does get 
approved, then it goes to the con-
ference committee—you and I know 
this—but there are some watching who 
heard this dialogue yesterday or these 
speeches yesterday from our colleagues 
on the Democratic side. Let me just re-
mind people, if we approve a bill, it 
still goes to conference committee. 
The legislation passed by the House 
of Representatives is considered; those 
two bills are merged; and then it comes 
back for another vote. They have a 
chance to amend. They have a chance 
to vote against it if they don’t like the 
final product, and then it is going to a 
conference committee with Speaker 
PELOSI’s version, and then they get to 
vote against that if they don’t like 
that. 
If all they do is allow deliberation of 
the bill—in what one said sarcastically 
was the ‘‘world’s greatest deliberative 
body’’—they would have this, that, and 
that opportunity to either change, dis-
approve, or to vote on something which 
they finally approve. That is how it is 
supposed to work. 
By the way, my young aide was 
bringing us into the Chamber and saw 
somebody in the hallway, and the 
young person said: Hmm, it doesn’t 
work that way. He remembered seeing 
this cartoon, this YouTube, when he 
was a kid. All he could say was: It 
doesn’t work that way. 
It should. It is how our Founding Fa-
thers set it up. But the other side de-
cided it doesn’t work that way, and 
that is too bad. That is too bad be-
cause, if we don’t do the work, if we 
don’t deliberate, if we continue to have 
status quo over the change and the re-
form that all the American people are

demanding, then we will not be answer-
ing the pleas of those peaceful pro-
testers who are asking for that change. 
The cynic might believe the Demo-
crats blocked deliberation of the JUS-
TICE Act because they don’t want the 
President or the Republicans to have a 
win in an election year. If that is the 
case, if this is purely political, they 
have let down the American people, es-
pecially those who demand justice. 
They let down the American people 
just to score political points. 
Maybe they blocked it because it 
doesn’t include the Democratic Party’s 
new wish list: defunding and abolishing 
police forces. Perhaps they knew that, 
if somebody offered an amendment to 
the JUSTICE Act to defund police, 
then Members would be forced to vote 
on the measure rather than just pay lip 
service to an idea that is going no-
where. 
Let me say, defunding and abolishing 
police forces is not the direction Re-
publicans believe we should take, for 
obvious reasons. Mobs are destroying 
and defacing property and destroying 
and defacing monuments of national 
heroes—George Washington, Abraham 
Lincoln, Ulysses Grant. World War II 
memorials are being defaced with swas-
tikas, torn down by a mob that hates 
the United States of America. 
When you establish a so-called po-
lice-free zone—an absurd promise for a 
utopian society that is, in fact, full of 
crime—the one in Seattle has had, I 
think, four shootings—at this point, 
the mob’s goal is not justice for George 
Floyd; the mob’s goal is about dis-
playing their hatred for the United 
States of America. 
If Senate Democrats reject that be-
havior of the mob, let the country hear 
you. Reject it. But that would require 
debate. That would require delibera-
tion. That is what is being denied the 
JUSTICE Act. That is what Senate 
Democrats will not allow. 
Here 
is 
what 
Senate 
Democrats 
blocked when they decided against al-
lowing deliberation of the JUSTICE 
Act, if you will, addressing the de-
mands of the people who are calling for 
reforms 
of 
policing. 
They 
denied 
stronger accountability measures for 
the police departments. The JUSTICE 
Act requires reporting of use of force 
and no-knock warrants. It increased 
penalty for false police reports. It in-
stitutes penalties for failing to prop-
erly use body cameras. It requires shar-
ing of disciplinary records so that de-
partments will know whether an appli-
cant has the history of bad behavior in 
another law enforcement department. 
By the way, some of the Senate 
Democrats have said they want to out-
law these things. Offer an amendment. 
That is why you deliberate. You don’t 
come up with a deal in a back room 
and bring it—and, oh, my gosh, we have 
to vote on it. You offer an amendment. 
Allow deliberation. 
Why will they not respond to the 
pleas of the American people to delib-
erate, to consider, to come up with 
some form of fairness and policing for 
those who feel like it has been denied? 
Let me continue. The JUSTICE Act 
requires the Department of Justice to 
develop and provide training and dees-
calation and intervention techniques 
to prevent police encounters from get-
ting out of hand. That training works. 
The New Orleans Police Department 
has implemented it. 
One of the images I saw when the 
riots were occurring in Minneapolis 
was the New Orleans Police Depart-
ment taking a knee with protesters in 
Jackson Square—literally on common 
ground—to say that we are with you to 
work towards a solution. That is be-
cause of this sort of training being in-
stituted there. I am so proud that my 
State has example of that which works. 
This bill would take that which works 
and make it common across the coun-
try. 
The 
JUSTICE 
Act 
also 
requires 
training and education about the Afri-
can-American 
socioeconomic 
cir-
cumstance so officers can gain a better 
perspective in these communities. It 
promotes understanding of how Afri-
can-American males are impacted by 
experience, 
including 
education, 
healthcare, financial status in the 
criminal justice system. It helps de-
partments know the best practices for 
police tactics, employment processes, 
community transparency, and how law 
enforcement can best engage on issues 
related to mental health, homeless-
ness, and addiction. 
Senator SCOTT, drawing from his own 
experiences, crafted a bill with reforms 
that will lead to more accountability, 
fewer uses of force, and a better under-
standing of disenfranchised and minor-
ity communities that police should 
also serve and protect. Criminal justice 
reform advocates have long called for 
the very same reforms the JUSTICE 
Act institutes. In fact, there is a lot of 
agreement between Republicans and 
Democrats on many of the reforms in 
this bill. 
I will ask once more: Why are Demo-
crats blocking even a consideration on 
this floor of this bill? If you don’t like 
it, work to change it. If it passes, it 
only passes with your votes. If it does 
pass, it then goes to the House of Rep-
resentatives for reconciliation with 
their bill, and then it comes back. But 
we should at least debate—at least pre-
tend to hear the cries of the American 
people who are asking for justice for 
those who perceive that they have been 
denied. 
We know that the JUSTICE Act 
brings about the changes to policing 
that Americans are calling for: more 
accountability, deescalation training, 
education, and other things. Yet again, 
Senate Democrats have blocked even a 
discussion of those reforms. 
I ask myself—it doesn’t make sense, 
good people—why would they block 
even consideration, any response what-
soever to the cries of the people on the 
street that the Congress do something? 
Why would they even do that? Then I 
return to this. I think they are afraid 
that someone on their side of the aisle 
will offer an amendment to defund the 
police, and they would have to go on 
the record as to whether or not they 
are going to appease a radical left base 
to vote to defund the police or whether 
or not they are going to support the 
men and women in uniform that pro-
tect us all. They don’t want that. 
It is not just a political calculation 
that they don’t want President Trump 
to have a win, I suppose; it is a polit-
ical calculation that they don’t want a 
loss. They don’t want to be forced to 
declare their support for the police or 
their support to defund the police. 
They are ignoring the cries of pro-
testers demanding that George Floyd 
never occur again in order to cover po-
litical tracks. I think it is important 
to recognize that defunding the police, 
which I think is a radical concept, is 
absurd. We need police officers. In fact, 
I am always struck that my colleagues 
of both parties always thank Capitol 
Police for the service they do. 
Don’t the people who live in our com-
munity thank the police officers to 
keep their business from being stolen 
and robbed or burned? I think they do. 
But on the other hand, if you think po-
lice should be defunded, allow that 
amendment to come up, and then vote 
on it. The American people didn’t send 
us here to duck tough votes. They sent 
us here to declare that which we be-
lieve in but also to represent their in-
terest. 
A word about the mob that is not 
peaceful protesters advocating for jus-
tice for all but those who hate the 
United States of America, who wish to 
erase our history, and who wish to re-
place our national heroes with toppled 
statues and swastikas and hammer and 
sickles upon the side of the building. 
The irony is that most of the mob re-
lies upon constitutional protections of 
free speech and freedom of assembly. 
We cherish those rights. We cherish 
them and thank those who are peace-
fully protesting for exercising those 
constitutional rights. 
I also hear from some of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
that, somehow, these actions of anar-
chists are just violent. There is a senti-
ment that says we try to enact change 
peacefully, but nothing is happening. I, 
unfortunately, have to agree with 
them. 
The Republicans have brought for-
ward a bill that would peacefully begin 
to make changes in how policing is un-
derstood and practiced and, in peace-
fully doing so, bring about change for 
which they are advocating. But again, 
nothing has happened because Senate 
Democrats have decided that they 
don’t even want to debate a bill, offer 
amendments, vote against the final 
product, or allow it to go to a con-
ference committee with the House of 
Representatives to be changed once 
more to perhaps come more to their 
liking. 
Again, my Senate Democratic col-
leagues are not just blocking reform;

they will not even allow discussion of 
reform. They don’t want to talk to Re-
publicans about it. They don’t want to 
take a stand on defunding and abol-
ishing police departments. Rather than 
have a debate, we go into hiding, leav-
ing the issues regarding the reform of 
policing unresolved. I hope my Demo-
cratic colleagues allow the debate to 
occur. I hope they recognize the impor-
tance of this issue to all Americans, es-
pecially to those in communities of 
color, but really to us all. 
To my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle: Come back to the table. Let’s 
hear your amendments. Let’s have de-
bate. Let’s enact the change we need 
by building a consensus on the best 
path forward. Let’s live up to the state-
ment that the Senate is the world’s 
greatest deliberative body. 
Together, the Senate—Republicans 
and Democrats—can deliver change for 
the American people. We can bring 
about the unity that we as a country 
desperately need in order to heal as a 
society, but this will only happen if my 
Senate Democratic colleagues stop hid-
ing behind procedural votes. 
Come to the floor. Let’s deliberate. 
Let’s do what the Founding Fathers 
imagined that we would. I know that it 
is politically difficult, but sometimes, 
we have to rise above political dif-
ficulty with a challenge of time, and 
that challenge is now. 
I yield back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

for the quorum call be rescinded.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN ROUSH 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
over the school’s two centuries, some 
of Kentucky’s brightest students have 
walked Centre College’s campus. Our 
Commonwealth’s first Governor, Isaac 
Shelby, chaired the inaugural board. 
Prominent 
Kentucky 
surgeon 
Dr. 
Ephraim McDowell, whose accolades 
include a statue here in the U.S. Cap-
itol, also served as a trustee. To date, 
Centre’s alumni include two U.S. Vice 
Presidents, one Chief Justice and an 
Associate 
Justice 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court, as well as more than a dozen 
Senators, 43 Members of Congress, and 
11 Governors. 
Today, I would like to pay tribute to 
another leading member of Centre’s 
community: its 20th president and my 
good friend Dr. John Roush. At the end 
of this month, John will complete his 
service to the school, closing out 22 
years 
of 
achievement 
that 
have 
brought 
well-deserved 
praise 
and 
growth to Centre. 
Since coming to Danville, John has 
led a transformation of the school. He 
championed major investments into 
campus infrastructure, the addition of 
new endowed professorships, and the 
completion of a $120 million capital 
campaign. Along the way, a national 
publication twice named Centre the top 
school in the South. 
Of course, Centre College is no 
stranger to making national headlines. 
In 2000, Centre hosted a Vice Presi-
dential debate between Dick Cheney 
and our former colleague Joe Lieber-
man. When Centre was selected for this 
prestigious honor, it was the smallest 
higher educational institution in his-
tory to host a Presidential or Vice 
Presidential debate. By any objective 
standard, the event was a total success, 
and it came as a clear result of John’s 
creativity and ingenuity. Afterward, a 
Washington Post writer praised the de-
bate as ‘‘one of the best ever. The 
whole day was a happy pageant of Nor-
man 
Rockwell 
meets 
Alexis 
de 
Tocqueville.’’ 
That writer wasn’t the only one im-
pressed by Centre’s performance. The 
Commission on Presidential Debates 
went back to John, asking Centre to 
host another Vice Presidential debate. 
Once again, the Centre community 
planned and executed an extraordinary 
event with the eyes of the country on 
them. 
Last year, John led Centre in the 
celebration of its bicentennial anniver-
sary with a full year of events. While 
the school honored its distinguished 
history, John seemed to consider his 
own place in it. He announced his re-
tirement from Centre, making him one 
of the three longest serving presidents 
in the school’s history. 
Perhaps John’s greatest legacy at 
Centre will be his fierce devotion to 
students. Every single graduate was in-
vited into his home at least twice dur-
ing their undergraduate years. With his 
beloved wife Susie, who is an institu-
tion herself, John brought compas-
sionate leadership to all aspects of his 
work. His colleagues called John the 
institution’s ‘‘beating heart.’’ As he 
leaves campus at the end of this 
month, 1 day before his 70th birthday, 
he should take pride in a job very well 
done. 
I am sure Centre College planned sev-
eral opportunities for its students, fac-
ulty, staff, alumni, and friends to ex-
press their sincere appreciation to 
John. Unfortunately, the coronavirus 
pandemic changed many of those plans. 
But there is nothing that can change 
our heartfelt gratitude to John and 
Susie for all they have done for Centre 
College and the Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky. As they embark on their next 
adventure together, we wish them the 
very best. 
f 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise in opposition to proceeding on S. 
3985, the JUSTICE Act, and want to 
briefly explain why. 
On May 25, a Minneapolis police offi-
cer kneeled on the neck of George 
Floyd for almost 9 minutes. Mr. Floyd 
repeatedly said he could not breathe 
and pleaded for officers to stop. The of-
ficers ignored his pleas and continued 
to kneel on his neck until his body 
went limp. George Floyd’s alleged 
crime? Using a counterfeit $20 bill to 
buy groceries during a global pan-
demic. 
As a nation, we have seen far too 
many unarmed Black men and women 
killed by police. Rayshard Brooks was 
shot twice in the back while running 
away from Atlanta police. The police 
had been called because he had fallen 
asleep in his car and was blocking a 
fast-food drive-thru. Breonna Taylor, 
an emergency medical worker, was 
shot eight times by Louisville police 
while asleep in her home. Eric Garner 
was choked to death by an NYPD offi-
cer for selling cigarettes. Freddie Gray 
was killed after being taken into cus-
tody by Baltimore police for possessing 
a knife. Walter Scott was shot in the 
back by North Charleston police after 
being stopped for a bad brake light. 
Stephon Clark was killed by Sac-
ramento police in his grandmother’s 
backyard for breaking windows. And 
Michael Brown was shot six times by 
Ferguson police while his hands were 
raised in the air. 
Over the past month, millions of peo-
ple—of all races, ages, and back-
grounds—have taken to the streets 
throughout the Nation to protest these 
killings and to demand real police re-
form. We need to respond with legisla-
tion that truly meets this moment, a 
bill that actually holds law enforce-
ment agencies and offices accountable 
under the law. 
The Republican JUSTICE Act is no-
where near enough. It simply does not 
impose accountability on law enforce-
ment. Specifically, it does not create a 
national use of force standard. For ex-
ample, in California, lethal force may 
only be used to prevent an imminent 
threat of death or serious bodily injury 
to the officer or to another person. It 
does not end racial profiling; in other 
words, it does not stop police from 
using race to target individuals, a prac-
tice I would hope that everyone agrees 
must cease. It does not prohibit no- 
knock warrants in drug cases, the very 
type of warrant that led to the death of 
Breonna Taylor. It does not reform 
qualified immunity, a legal defense 
that has allowed officers to avoid ac-
countability even when they have bro-
ken the law. Instead of fixing these 
problems, the JUSTICE Act collects 
more information and data on prob-
lems we already know exist. 
We do not need more information. We 
need to address the underlying issues 
of systemic racism and police use of 
force. That is where the Justice in Po-
licing Act comes in. Senator BOOKER 
and Senator HARRIS
introduced this 
bill earlier this month. It should be our 
starting point. The bill makes mean-
ingful reforms. For example, it re-
quires that police departments ban

choke holds and carotid holds in order 
to receive Federal funds. It prohibits 
the use of racial profiling by police of-
ficers. It creates a national police mis-
conduct registry that would collect dis-
ciplinary or termination history of of-
ficers so potential employers would 
know of an officer’s past misconduct. It 
gives subpoena authority to the Jus-
tice Department to conduct ‘‘pattern 
or practice’’ investigations. It elimi-
nates the defense of ‘‘qualified immu-
nity’’ so that police officers can be held 
civilly liable under the law for mis-
conduct. And it amends Federal crimi-
nal law so officers can more effectively 
be charged for violating people’s con-
stitutional and legal rights. 
Meaningful reform is long overdue, 
and rather than rushing a weak bill to 
the floor, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee should take up the Justice in 
Policing Act as soon as possible. This 
is how the Senate is supposed to work. 
We should not be trying to address this 
important issue by rushing an insuffi-
cient bill to the floor. Now is the time 
for leadership, courage, and real police 
reform. 
Thank you.

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
the committee is closely monitoring 
upgrades to F–35 software and other ca-
pabilities under the continuous capa-
bility development and delivery C2D2 
stragetic 
modernization 
framework. 
The principal purpose for C2D2 is the 
development of Block 4 software and 
weapons system upgrades, which also 
includes other elements like Technical 
Refresh–3 and dual weapons capability, 
to ensure the F–35 maintains it oper-
ational advantage. However, the com-
mittee is concerned the planned F–35 
air vehicle capability growth, associ-
ated with Block 4 weapons systems en-
hancements, will exceed the estab-
lished thrust, power, and thermal man-
agement capabilities of the current 
F135 propulsion system beginning with 
the delivery of Lot 18 aircraft. Such a 
capability gap between the current 
F135 performance and future require-
ments could significantly constrain the 
operational capabilities of the F–35 
weapons system. 
The committee is aware of a recent 
agreement to conduct a 6-month pro-
pulsion study and operational assess-
ment to determine the specific F135 
propulsion growth requirement that 
would address this capability gap. The 
study to determine the future propul-
sion requirement is expected to con-
clude in the first quarter of fiscal year 
2021. The committee strongly endorses 
this approach and encourages the De-
partment of Defense to submit rec-
ommendations to Congress following 
completion of the study. Further, the 
committee strongly supports a long- 
term focus on propulsion improve-
ments over fiscal years 2021–2025 nec-
essary to support engineering and man-
ufacturing development for upgraded 
engine 
production 
supporting 
the 
planned delivery of Lot 18 aircraft. 
Therefore, the committee directs the 
Department of Defense and Joint Pro-
gram Office to establish an F135 Pro-
pulsion Growth Program that ensures 
propulsion growth requirements are 
aligned with and support weapons sys-
tems upgrade requirements. Finally, 
the committee directs the Secretary of 
Defense to include funding in the fiscal 
year 2022 budget request to support the 
F135 
Propulsion 
Growth 
Program 
across the Future Years Defense Plan.

RECOGNIZING THE 555TH FIGHTER 
SQUADRON 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the 
‘‘World 
Famous 
Highly 
Respected’’ 
555th 
Fighter 
Squadron, 
commonly 
known as the Triple Nickel, recently 
completed the Department of Defense’s 
first real-world combat Dynamic Force 
Employment DFE to United States 
Central Command. In plain English, 
the Triple Nickel executed an un-
planned departure to the Middle East 
last fall to combat Iranian aggression 
against the United States and our al-
lies in the region. 
During its historic deployment, the 
squadron flew more than 7,000 hours 
supporting operations in the Arabian 
Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. 
Demonstrating the rapid, agile, and le-
thal characteristics of airpower, the 
Nickel executed defensive counter-air 
missions 
in 
Syria—routinely 
inter-
cepting and monitoring Russian, Syr-
ian, and Iranian aircraft operating near 
U.S. and partnered ground forces. It 
also provided close air support to 
troops battling the Taliban in Afghani-
stan, as well as ISIS in Iraq and Syria. 
The Nickel returned home in Decem-
ber as Iran’s aggression began to wane 
but deployed a second time only days 
later when tensions rapidly escalated 
following 
the 
U.S. 
strike 
against 
Qasem Soleimani. The squadron subse-
quently executed force protection mis-
sions in Iraq during and after Iran’s 
missile attacks against U.S. forces. 
The Triple Nickel then deployed to a 
second expeditionary operating loca-
tion. U.S. F–16s had not conducted 
combat missions from this location 
since 2003. From there, the squadron 
was able to immediately respond to the 
rocket attacks on Camp Taji, Iraq, by 
Iranian-backed Shia militia groups and 
execute retaliatory strikes. 
The squadron returned to Avianio 
Air Base, Italy, in late April as the Air 
Force’s first major combat unit to re-
deploy during the China virus pan-
demic. Throughout their deployment, 
the men and women of the 555th Expe-
ditionary Fighter Squadron and Main-
tenance Unit performed exceptionally 
under tense combat pressures exe-
cuting a new and highly mobile deploy-
ment construct during a pandemic. The 
Triple 
Nickel 
represents 
the 
best 
America has to offer, and I congratu-
late them on a job well done. ‘‘Once 
Green!’’

TRIBUTE TO KIM CAWLEY 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President. I rise today 
to recognize the distinguished career 
and retirement of Kim Cawley after 34 
years of service at the Congressional 
Budget Office. Kim has been Chief of 
the Natural and Physical Resources 
Cost Estimates Unit for more than 20 
of those years, also spent over a decade 
as one of CBO’s energy analysts. He is 
one of that agency’s experts on the Nu-
clear Waste Fund, the treatment of 
Federal loans and loan guarantees, and 
the budgetary effects of Federal insur-
ance programs. 
It is hard to overstate Kim’s role in 
analyzing the budgetary impacts of an 
incredibly broad swath of legislation 
over the past three decades. He has 
been instrumental in providing objec-
tive, carefully researched estimates of 
thousands of pieces of legislation that 
the Congress has considered, debated, 
and enacted since the mid–1980, includ-
ing bills dealing with flood insurance, 
compensation for victims of asbestos 
and oilspills, Federal property sales, 
and infrastructure financing, to name 
just a few. 
Kim has worked tirelessly with Mem-
bers of Congress and our staff on both 
sides of the aisle throughout those 
years. During many hours of discussion 
and patient explanation, he could be 
counted on to be forthright and fair. He 
embodied CBO’s commitment to non-
partisan analysis and helped the Con-
gress understand the intricacies of 
such complex laws as the Federal Cred-
it Reform Act, the Terrorism Risk In-
surance Act, and the 9-11 Victims Com-
pensation Act. 
Kim has been a mentor and guide to 
dozens of CBO analysts. Thanks to his

guidance and training, a generation of 
CBO analysts think harder, dig deeper, 
and ask more probing questions when 
analyzing the estimated the costs of 
legislation. Kim set high standards for 
himself and for the Natural Resources 
Unit, and we are confident that they 
will continue to provide timely and 
thorough analyses for the Congress 
thanks to what they have learned 
under Kim’s leadership. 
I, along with House Budget Com-
mittee Chairman JOHN YARMUTH, wish 
to thank Kim for his years of dedicated 
service to the Congress and extend to 
him our best wishes for a well-deserved 
retirement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RICHARD 
BENEVILLE 
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor the legacy of a 
friend and one of Alaska’s truly unique 
individuals, the mayor of Nome, Rich-
ard Beneville. We lost the mayor last 
month when he succumbed to pneu-
monia in the town he called home for 
more than 32 years. Richard’s life story 
was colorful. He left New York City as 
a young man struggling with alco-
holism and searching for a new life. 
Alaska was as far away as he could go, 
and he often said Alaska saved him. He 
spent a few years in Barrow before 
moving to Nome in 1988, and I think it 
is fair to say that the town has never 
been the same since. His career began 
on Broadway, and Richard channeled 
his creative energy to inspire youth 
and adults in Nome through the Nome 
Arts Council. He directed more than 
three dozen plays, including ‘‘The 
Sound of Music,’’ ‘‘Music Man,’’ and 
‘‘Fiddler on the Roof,’’ and inspired 
generations in the community to ap-
preciate the stage. 
Ever the showman, Richard was a 
tireless ambassador for Nome and Arc-
tic tourism. He founded Nome Dis-
covery Tours in 1994, and he never 
missed an opportunity to promote 
Nome and the surrounding region and 
its rich history. Watching him enter-
tain a tour group with tales of Nome’s 
early gold mining days, while he dem-
onstrated how to pan for gold, audience 
captivated, was a real treasure. 
For the past 41⁄2 years, he served as 
mayor of Nome, and there was no bet-
ter cheerleader for this remote commu-
nity. Some of my colleagues may recall 
running into him in the halls of the 
Hart and Dirksen Buildings, wearing 
his signature ‘‘Hello Central’ knit hat, 
a Port of Nome, vest and always sport-
ing his I love Nome! button. Never shy, 
Richard would greet Senators, staff, 
and visitors alike, quickly asking them 
how their day was and what they were 
up to as he worked the halls and made 
new friends. His friendly banter and 
genuine interest in people was refresh-
ing in an environment all too often 
filled with hustle and tension. 
For those of you who have never had 
the fortune to visit Nome, there are 
only three ways to get there from An-
chorage—airplane, boat, and dog sled. 
Nome is 2000 miles closer to the North 
Pole than to New York City, and in 
2016 when the Crystal Serenity called on 
the Port of Nome during its maiden 
voyage from Seward to Manhattan, the 
mayor was there to greet these in-
trepid Arctic adventurers. I had the 
privilege to travel with Richard to 
many Arctic conferences, and it was a 
joy to watch as he shared his vision for 
Arctic tourism and a positive future 
for this fascinating and challenging 
part of the world. 
The mayor was a passionate cham-
pion of the Iditarod and I last saw him 
on Saturday, March 7, in Anchorage at 
the ceremonial start of the race. He 
had just been released from the hos-
pital, having persuaded his doctors and 
nurses that the ‘‘show must go on’’ to 
be there for the festivities. 
He loved people, the arts, flowers, 
and above all, Nome to the end. His 
passing is a true loss for my State. I 
will miss his boundless enthusiasm and 
his trademark greeting to all he ran 
into, ‘‘Hello Central!’’∑

RECOGNIZING MERCEDES 
SCIENTIFIC 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
woman-owned small business that pro-
vides critical medical supplies to hos-
pitals 
and 
laboratories 
nationwide. 
This week, it is my pleasure to honor 
Mercedes 
Scientific 
of 
Lakewood 
Ranch, FL, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
In 
1991, 
Noelle 
Haft 
and 
Hank 
Traynor founded Mercedes Scientific in 
New Hyde Park, NY. The two were vet-
erans of the medical supply industry, 
combining their scientific expertise 
and knowledge of laboratory distribu-
tion to start their own small business. 
At the time, it was known as Mercedes 
Medical. Drawn by the weather and 
welcoming business regulations, Mer-
cedes Medical relocated to Florida in 
1993. When Hank retired, Noelle and 
her husband, Rob, continued running 
the company along with their daugh-
ter, Alex Miller. 
Over the next few decades, Mercedes 
Medical remained a family-owned com-
pany as it grew into a notable medical 
supplier. The company moved into 
their Lakewood Ranch facility in 2018 
and expanded to provide laboratory 
equipment 
and 
personal 
protective 
equipment, PPE. They rebranded as 
Mercedes Scientific in 2019 due to their 
growing focus on serving the research, 
laboratory, 
and 
scientific 
commu-
nities. 
Mercedes Scientific is active in the 
community. They donate medical sup-
plies to local organizations and busi-
nesses, as well as educational institu-
tions nationwide. The company sup-
ports international nonprofit missions, 
such as helping medical facilities re-
cover from natural disasters. Closer to 
home, Mercedes Scientific is a team 
build partner with Habitat for Human-
ity in Sarasota, FL. They also work 
with the Lakewood Ranch Business Al-
liance to promote local economic de-
velopment. 
Like many small businesses in Flor-
ida, Mercedes Scientific experienced 
supply chain disruptions due to the 
coronavirus pandemic. As a medical 
supply company, they play a critical 
role in securing laboratory supplies, 
PPE, and COVID–19 test kits. Mercedes 
Scientific works tirelessly with labora-
tories and hospitals in Florida and 
throughout the Nation to ensure they 
receive the resources needed to combat 
the pandemic. 
When the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program, PPP, Mercedes 
Scientific applied for funding. The PPP 
provides forgivable loans to impacted 
small businesses and nonprofits who 
maintain their payroll during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Thanks to a PPP 
loan, Mercedes Scientific was able to 
keep their 67 employees paid and re-
main focused on its mission sourcing 
medical supplies. 
Mercedes Scientific is a notable ex-
ample of the key role small businesses 
play 
in 
America’s 
medical 
supply 
chains. I commend their continued 
work to provide essential hospital and 
laboratory 
supplies 
as 
the 
United 
States confronts the coronavirus pan-
demic. Congratulations to Noelle, Rob, 
Alex, and the whole team. I look for-
ward 
to 
your 
continued 
success, 
growth, and success in the Lakewood 
Ranch area.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
INHOFE, Mr. MORAN, Mr. JONES, 
and Mrs. HYDE-SMITH): 
S. 4053. A bill to amend the Energy 
Policy Act of 1992 to modernize the 
EPSCoR program of the Department of 
Energy, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I in-
troduce, along with Senator INHOFE, 
Senator JONES, Senator MORAN, and 
Senator HYDE-SMITH, the DOE EPSCoR 
Modernization Act of 2020. 
As many of our colleagues are aware, 
the Department of Energy Established 
Program to Stimulate Competitive Re-
search (DOE EPSCoR) was established 
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 
102–486). This critical initiative seeks 
to improve the capacity of eligible 
states to conduct nationally competi-
tive energy research and connect eligi-
ble states with the National Labora-
tory System. 
The purpose of the bill we are intro-
ducing is to broaden the scope of the

June 24, 2020 
research funded by the DOE EPSCoR 
program beyond basic science, to en-
compass the full range of research sup-
ported by DOE. This includes cutting- 
edge research in applied energy tech-
nologies, 
energy 
efficiency, 
energy 
storage, and environmental manage-
ment, to name a few key areas. Yet, be-
cause of the program’s narrow focus on 
basic science, EPSCoR States are only 
able to support a small fraction of 
DOE’s research mission. 
Our bill would continue to support 
investments in research infrastructure 
and expand opportunities for EPSCoR 
institutions to partner with National 
Laboratories to conduct their research. 
Our bill would also increase support for 
graduate students and early career fac-
ulty. 
When 
the 
National 
Academy 
of 
Sciences evaluated EPSCoR programs, 
it concluded that EPSCoR programs 
are critical to the nation’s scientific 
and technology leadership, because 
EPSCoR helps ensure that talented re-
searchers and scientists from all 50 
states are partners in science and tech-
nology research. This is even truer in 
the context of energy issues, where 
each state and region faces different 
energy opportunities and infrastruc-
ture challenges. 
By modernizing the program and 
bringing 
it 
into 
alignment 
with 
EPSCoR programs operated by other 
agencies, DOE EPSCoR will be better 
positioned to meet today’s energy chal-
lenges and align with the interests and 
strengths of EPSCoR states. I am 
pleased to have the support of the Coa-
lition of EPSCoR/IDeA States in this 
effort, and I urge our colleagues to join 
us in pressing for passage of this bill. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and 
Mr. RUBIO): 
S. 4055. A bill to address health work-
force shortages and disparities high-
lighted by the COVID–19 pandemic 
through additional funding for the Na-
tional Health Service Corps and the 
Nurse Corps, and to establish a Na-
tional Health Service Corps Emergency 
Service demonstration project; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4055 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strength-
ening America’s Health Care Readiness Act’’.

undermine our common values, security in-
terests, and shared vision. The United States 
and Europe will work together to counter 
Russian subversion and aggression, and the 
threats posed by North Korea and Iran. We 
will continue to advance our shared prin-
ciples and interests in international fo-
rums.’’. 
(2) After the end of World War II, the pres-
ence of foreign military forces in Germany 
was governed by a law signed in April 1949 
that allowed France, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States to retain forces in 
Germany. 
(3) The initial law was succeeded by the 
Convention on the Presence of Foreign 
Forces in the Federal Republic of Germany, 
signed at Paris on October 23, 1954, allowing 
eight North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) members, specifically Belgium, Can-
ada, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States, to maintain a long-term pres-
ence of military forces in the Federal Repub-
lic of Germany. 
(4) The Federal Republic of Germany has 
made significant contributions to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance, and 
by hosting the largest United States Armed 
Forces presence in Europe, the Federal Re-
public of Germany has borne a significant 
burden in the interest of collective security. 
(5) As of June 2020, the United States pres-
ence in various locations in the Federal Re-
public of Germany, including in Stuttgart at 
the United States European Command and 
the United States Africa Command, consists 
of— 
(A) approximately— 
(i) 35,000 members of the Armed Forces; 
(ii) 10,000 Department of Defense civilian 
employees; and 
(iii) 2,000 defense contractors; 
(B) personnel of the Department of State 
and other United States Government agen-
cies; and 
(C) the dependents of individuals described 
in subparagraphs (A) and (B). 
(6) The United States presence in Europe, 
including in the Federal Republic of Ger-
many— 
(A) protects and defends the United States 
and United States allies and partners by de-
terring conflict with the Russian Federation 
and other adversaries; 
(B) strengthens and supports the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization alliance and crit-
ical partnerships in Europe; and 
(C) serves as an essential support platform 
for carrying out vital national security en-
gagements in Afghanistan, the Middle East, 
Africa, and Europe. 
(7) The deep bilateral ties between the 
United States and the Federal Republic of 
Germany have led to decades of economic 
prosperity for both countries and their allies 
and have strengthened human rights and de-
mocracy around the world. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States should continue to 
maintain and strengthen the bilateral rela-
tionship with the Federal Republic of Ger-
many and the relationships with other Euro-
pean allies; 
(2) the United States should maintain a ro-
bust military presence in the Federal Repub-
lic of Germany so as to deter further aggres-
sion from the Russian Federation or aggres-
sion from other adversaries against the 
United States and its allies and partners; 
and 
(3) the United States should remain com-
mitted to strong collaboration with Euro-
pean allies as outlined in the 2017 National 
Security Strategy.

tions for fiscal year 2021 for military

SEC. lll. LIMITATION ON ALTERATION OF 
NAVY FLEET MIX. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States shipbuilding and sup-
porting vendor base constitute a national se-
curity imperative that is unique and must be 
protected; 
(2) a healthy and efficient industrial base 
continues to be a fundamental driver for 
achieving and sustaining a successful ship-
building procurement strategy; 
(3) without consistent and continuous com-
mitment to steady and predictable acquisi-
tion profiles, the industrial base will strug-
gle and some elements may not survive; and 
(4) proposed reductions in the future-years 
defense program to the DDG–51 Destroyer 
procurement profile without a clear transi-
tion to procurement of the next Large Sur-
face Combatant would adversely affect the 
shipbuilding industrial base and long-term 
strategic objectives of the Navy. 
(b) LIMITATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of the Navy 
may not deviate from the 2016 Navy Force 
Structure Assessment to implement the re-
sults of a new force structure assessment or 
new annual long-range plan for construction 
of naval vessels that would reduce the re-
quirement for Large Surface Combatants to 
fewer than 104 such vessels until the date on 
which the Secretary of the Navy submits to 
the congressional defense committees the 
certification under paragraph (1) and the re-
port under subsection (c). 
(2) CERTIFICATION.—The certification re-
ferred to in paragraph (1) is a certification, 
in writing, that each of the following condi-
tions have been satisfied: 
(A) The large surface combatant ship-
building industrial base and supporting ven-
dor base would not significantly deteriorate 
due to a reduced procurement profile. 
(B) All current shipbuilders of large sur-
face combatants will remain viable, in terms 
of sufficient new construction ship procure-
ment, to construct the next class of Large 
Surface Combatants. 
(C) The Navy can mitigate the reduction in 
anti-air and ballistic missile defense capa-
bilities due to having a reduced number of 
DDG–51 Destroyers with the advanced AN/ 
SPY–6 radar in the next three decades. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report 
that includes— 
(1) a description of likely detrimental im-
pacts to the large surface combatant indus-
trial base and the Navy’s plan to mitigate 
any such impacts if the fiscal year 2021 fu-
ture-years defense program were imple-
mented as proposed; 
(2) a review of the benefits to the Navy 
fleet of the new AN/SPY–6 radar to be de-
ployed aboard Flight III variant DDG–51 De-
stroyers, which are currently under con-
struction, as well as an analysis of impacts 
to the fleet’s warfighting capabilities, should 
the number of such destroyers be reduced; 
and 
(3) a plan to fully implement section 131 of 
the National Defense Authorization for Fis-
cal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92), including 
subsystem prototyping efforts and funding 
by fiscal year.

FACILITY ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 433, S. 2472. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2472) to redesignate the NASA 
John H. Glenn Research Center at Plum 
Brook Station, Ohio, as the NASA John H. 
Glenn Research Center at the Neil A. Arm-
strong Test Facility. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 2472) was ordered to be 
engrossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed, as follows: 
S. 2472 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Neil A. Arm-
strong Test Facility Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds as follows: 
(1) Neil A. Armstrong, through his own def-
inition, was first and foremost as a test 
pilot. 
(2) A native of Wapakoneta, Ohio, Arm-
strong began his inspiring career in space ex-
ploration in Cleveland, Ohio, at what is now 
the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center. 
(3) Becoming the first human to land a 
spacecraft, and then set foot upon, the moon, 
represents the greatest dream of any test 
pilot. 
(4) Therefore, it is fitting that the premier 
aeronautics and space test station in Ohio 
should be renamed in his honor. 
SEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF NASA JOHN H. 
GLENN RESEARCH CENTER AT PLUM 
BROOK STATION, OHIO, AS NASA 
JOHN H. GLENN RESEARCH CENTER 
AT THE NEIL A. ARMSTRONG TEST 
FACILITY. 
(a) REDESIGNATION.—The NASA John H. 
Glenn Research Center at Plum Brook Sta-
tion, Ohio, is hereby redesignated as the 
NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at the 
Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the station re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘NASA John H. Glenn 
Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facil-
ity’’. 
(c) SAVINGS.—Nothing in this section shall 
be construed to alter the relationship be-
tween the Plum Brook Station and the 
NASA John H. Glenn Research Center. 
f

and pledge, the morning hour be

CONGRATULATING DARIN LANDRY 
AS 
ARKANSAS 
PRINCIPAL 
OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Darin Landry of Lake-
side High School in Hot Springs for his recent 
recognition as the 2020 Arkansas Principal of 
the Year. Landry was given this award by the 
Arkansas Association of Secondary School 
Principals (AASSP) in recognition of his years 
of service and his innovative techniques for 
educating Arkansas students. 
Among Landry’s successes as an educator 
is the Second Chance Policy program in which 
students found to be in possession or under 
the influence of drugs at school are given the 
opportunity for community service hours and 
access to drug and alcohol abuse programs. 
In addition, he has implemented a ‘‘restorative 
justice program’’ in which educators implement 
alternative methods of discipline to see stu-
dents succeed and decrease student suspen-
sions and expulsions. 
Landry has worked extensively with the rest 
of the school district and with the community 
to start projects such as the Lakeside Legacy 
Program, the Project Search program which 
provides onsite job training, and the Future of 
Lakeside Committee dedicated to determining 
a new method of ranking students. 
It is clear from Landry’s years of work that 
his goal is to seek a better learning environ-
ment for these students. I take this time to 
thank him for his commitment to our commu-
nity’s youngest minds and to congratulate him 
on this high honor.

RECOGNIZING THE PALISADES 
FOURTH OF JULY PARADE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing the Washington, D.C. Pali-
sades Citizens Association and the annual 
Palisades Fourth of July parade. I have 
walked in this parade ever since I was elect-
ed, and I deeply regret that the pandemic will 
keep us from coming together this year to cel-
ebrate the 54th anniversary of the parade. 
Begun in 1966, the annual Palisades Fourth 
of July Parade is a time-honored District of 
Columbia tradition. Each year, the parade, or-
ganized by the Palisades Citizens Association, 
kicks off at 11:00 a.m. and proceeds along 
MacArthur Boulevard NW from the firehouse 
on Whitehaven Parkway NW to the Palisades 
Recreation Center. Last year, I was happy to 
participate alongside the D.C. Girl Scouts. A 
true local celebration, the Palisades parade is 
complete with artfully crafted floats, local lead-
ers, D.C.’s unforgiving summer heat, dancing, 
music, watermelon and hot dogs. It is a one- 
mile walk showcasing D.C.’s best. 
As we celebrate July 4th this year, in ways 
that promote social distancing, it is with a his-
toric accomplishment in tow—House passage 
of the D.C. statehood bill, H.R. 51, the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act, for the first time in 
American history. 
Each year, I encourage D.C. residents to 
march on July 4th to remind the country that 
the war to end taxation without representation 
is not finished. We will not be truly equal with 
the states until the District achieves statehood, 
which includes equal representation and full 
self-government. Last week, we moved close 
to that goal for the first time in 219 years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me as we celebrate, in 
spirit, the 54th annual Palisades Parade and 
honor the Palisades Citizens Association.

RECOGNIZING THE ‘‘ANGELS’’ OF 
COLES-MOULTRIE ELECTRIC CO-
OPERATIVE 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize four employees of the Coles- 
Moultrie Electric Cooperative (CMEC) for their 
efforts in saving a life. 
On April 3, 2020, Mitch Stanciu, Bob 
Schafer, Jim Geldert, and Brock Cook were 
out on a service call when the customer, a 
veteran from the Vietnam War, collapsed to 
the ground. The team rushed over, and 
Schafer and Stanciu, who both knew first aid, 
rendered assistance. Immediately an emer-
gency call was transmitted as part of the co- 
op’s rescue procedure, though with a unique 
wrinkle. Usually these calls would be made 
because a worker had made contact with an 
electric line. This time was different as it was 
a member of the co-op who needed emer-
gency assistance. 
The co-op’s IT chief, David Welsh, heard 
the call and determined the location of the 
emergency by using his vehicle’s GPS system 
to find Stanciu’s truck. Welsh immediately pro-
vided the coordinates to EMS personnel and 
an ambulance arrived within fifteen minutes of 
the incident first occurring. The victim was 
transported to the nearest hospital and then 
airlifted to a second hospital, where surgeons 
removed a blood clot from the man’s brain. 
Madam Speaker, I think the victim’s daugh-
ter summarized it best when she called the 
CMEC workers ‘‘angels . . . who didn’t pause 
in the face of a crisis,’’ and it is an honor to 
stand today to recognize their efforts. 
IN RECOGNITION OF DORRIS 
LEUTNER’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dorris M. Leutner celebrating 
her 100th birthday. 
Dorris, a resident of Calumet County, Wis-
consin was born on July 1st, 1920. Growing 
up through the Great Depression, Dorris 
learned the value of hard work and service. 
She went on to join the Armed Services as a 
member of the United States Army during 
World War II. Enlisting on March 26, 1942, 
she rose to the rank of Technical Sergeant. 
During her service in the Army, Dorris was 
stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland. Fort 
Meade was an integral training center during 
World War II, and throughout the war, its facili-
ties were used by an estimated three and a 
half million men and women. Fort Meade’s op-
erations varied greatly, from providing bread to 
those serving, training young men and women 
in Special Services as entertainers for enlisted 
troops, and holding German and Italian Pris-
oners of War. 
As a Technical Sergeant, Dorris was dedi-
cated to serving others. She worked as a den-
tal assistant for an Army oral surgeon, oper-
ating under difficult conditions to perform a 
vital service for her fellow soldiers. Dorris left 
the Army on February 2, 1945 having served 
her country for nearly three years through the 
height of the Second World War. 
Throughout her life, Dorris continued to dis-
play the courage and selflessness dem-
onstrated by the great men and women serv-
ing in our Armed Forces. Dorris truly em-
bodies the character and strength of this coun-
try’s Greatest Generation, serving our country 
with dignity and pride during one of its great-
est times of need. Her dedication and sacrifice 
continue to be an inspiration to many in North-
east Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in thanking Dorris Leutner for 
her service to this country and wishing her a 
happy and healthy 100th birthday.

today to recognize Chief Warrant Officer 4

eran of the U.S. Army and civil servant. CW4

HONORING DON GREER 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer 
these remarks in honor of Donald Edward 
Greer of Blacksburg, Virginia, who passed 
away on May 28, 2020 at the age of 96. Mr. 
Greer was a career military pilot and a pioneer 
in satellite technology. 
Mr. Greer was the second of Nellie and 
Fred Greer’s seven children and was born in 
1924 in Rock Island, Washington. While study-
ing at the University of the Pacific, he met his 
wife Loretta Walker. They were married in the 
college chapel and enjoyed 64 years of mar-
riage together until her death in 2013. He also 
played football during his time at the univer-
sity, participating in the Raisin Bowl and play-
ing alongside future NFL quarterback Eddie 
LaBaron. 
As a military pilot, Mr. Greer served his 
country in two wars and held important re-
sponsibilities. In World War II, he flew B–29s 
from the Mariana Islands. In the Korean War, 
he completed 33 missions and more than 300 
flying hours with his brother Herb in the same 
crew, the only set of family members that 
were flying combat missions together. He later 
flew the latest aircraft for the Strategic Air 
Command, piloted Air Force One for President 
Lyndon B. Johnson, and served as the con-
gressional liaison for Secretary of the Air 
Force Eugene M. Zuckert. He retired from the 
Air Force as a lieutenant colonel. 
In 1964, Mr. Greer became Vice President 
of Executive Services at Communications Sat-
ellite Corporation. In the heated days of the 
Space Race with the Soviet Union, he and the 
corporation’s president, Dr. Joseph Charyk, 
devoted their energy to the development of 
geosynchronous satellites. They traveled the 
world and built support for the endeavor. Sat-
ellite communications would become a build-
ing block of the modern world. 
Apart from his work responsibilities, Mr. 
Greer enjoyed hunting and fishing. He was a 
skilled golfer who played in many tournaments 
alongside Dr. Charyk. In his later years, he re-
tired to Blacksburg and became a fan of Vir-
ginia Tech, the alma mater of his daughter 
Heather and four of his grandchildren. 
He is survived by his daughters Heather 
and Rhonda and their husbands Wally and 
Mike, six grandchildren, three great-grand-
children, and his younger siblings Harry and 
Dallas. I offer my condolences to them upon 
the close of Don Greer’s remarkable life.

HONORING MANUEL KILLEBREW 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a living legend, 
a vessel of honor Mr. Manuel Killebrew. 
Manuel Killebrew was born on November 
11, 1950. He is the sixth child born to the Late 
Paul and Naomi B. Killebrew. He spent his 
early years in Marks and Lambert MS. 
Manuel Killebrew attended and graduated 
from Quitman County High School in 1970. 
After earning his high school diploma, he re-
ceived a B.A. in Industrial Arts from Jackson 
State University in 1974. Manuel still lives in 
the home that his father had built for 
$4,500.00. He has been married to the love of 
his life (Jewel Phipps Killebrew) for 47 years. 
They are proud parents of Latonia (Marvin) 
Thigpen and Manuel Killebrew Jr. They have 
been blessed with four grandchildren and five 
great grandchildren. He and his lovely wife 
have been blessed to travel in their retirement 
both in the Unites States and abroad, most re-
cently to Japan, Hong Kong and Beijing. The 
highlight oftheir trip to Asia was to stand on 
the Great Wall of China. 
While still in high school, he participated in 
a walk out in protest to the unfair treatment of 
people of color. Mr. Killebrew was a partici-
pant in the March on Washington. He also 
participated in the historic Mule Train. He was 
honored as a Man ofthe Year for the Mule 
Train Historical Society. 
Down thru the years, Mr. Killebrew has 
worked as a grocery stock clerk, janitor, bus 
driver, teacher, and a special education trainer 
for new teachers. He currently serves as a 
deacon and treasurer for Valley Queen M.B. 
Church, and president of Delta Burial. He 
serves on North Delta Planning Development, 
Quitman County Gala, and the Northwest 
Community Foundation. The job he has most 
enjoyed has been serving as President for the 
Board of Supervisors for Quitman County for 
more than 30 years. Mr. Manuel Killebrew is 
still a country boy at heart, his fall ‘‘green 
patch’’ is welcomed by Quitman County resi-
dents and others. 
Mr. Killebrew has been recognized through-
out the Delta as a man of impeccable integrity, 
service, compassion and outstanding spirit. 
Mr. Killebrew’s raison d’etre (known for) will al-
ways be the small acts of kindness done well, 
and without expectation of reward or recogni-
tion. These are the acts of kindness that will 
find a special place in people’s hearts. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Manuel Killebrew for his 
legacy of service and dedication to the great 
citizens of Mississippi’s Delta. 
HONORING THE FAITHFUL SERV-
ICE OF MR. ED CARTER OF TEN-
NESSEE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the service of Mr. 
Ed Carter, an upstanding American and Ten-
nessean. 
A native of Hawkins County in East Ten-
nessee, Ed Carter graduated from the Univer-
sity of Tennessee and began his career with 
the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission 
(later renamed the Tennessee Wildlife Re-
sources Agency) in 1972. Over the next four 
decades, he served in a number of law en-
forcement and public information positions 
with the Commission. He also served as the 
Chief of the TWRA Boating Division until 
March of 2009, when the Tennessee Wildlife 
Resources Commission appointed him as Ex-
ecutive Director of the TWRA. 
As Executive Director, Ed oversees all oper-
ations of the TWRA and its over seven hun-
dred employees. The agency manages the 
State of Tennessee’s wildlife and fisheries pro-
grams and governs all boating safety pro-
grams within the state. He has served as 
President of the Southeastern Association of 
Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and he also 
serves on the Federal/State Joint Task Force 
for federal aid. 
Ed has received many well-deserved honors 
for his faithful service and unparalleled efforts 
to conserve the natural beauty and abundant 
wildlife of Tennessee. The Tennessee General 
Assembly recognized Ed with a joint resolution 
for his meritorious service to the citizens of the 
State of Tennessee. In addition, the National 
Safe Boating Council inducted him into the 
National Boating Safety Hall of Fame, and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service honored him 
with the Conservation Partner Award. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in con-
gratulating Ed Carter on his retirement after 
five decades of public service. All who have 
had the opportunity to enjoy the scenic beauty 
of Tennessee’s rolling hills and refreshing 
waters can thank Ed for his faithful steward-
ship over the years.

addition to her work with over 50 nonprofits 
such as Garvan Woodland Gardens, The Ar-
kansas Rice Depot, and the Hot Springs Doc-
umentary Film Festival, she spends much her 
time on children and teenagers with organiza-
tions like Youth Ranches, THEA Foundation,

Morris also co-founded the Hot Springs Giv-
ing Circle with Don Munro, a fellow Hot 
Springs citizen, with the effort of dispersing 
funds to numerous local organizations. She 
additionally started the Morris Foundation with 
her late husband, Walter. 
Her induction into the Arkansas Women’s

REMEMBERING 
DR. 
THOMAS 
F. 
FREEMAN: EDUCATOR, SCHOLAR, 
AND 
LEGENDARY 
COACH 
AND 
TEACHER OF THE ART OF DE-
BATE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to Dr. Thomas F. Freeman, who 
for more than 60 years has been a professor 
of philosophy at Texas Southern University, 
which is located in my congressional district. 
Dr. Freeman died last week, on Saturday, 
June 6, 2020, in Houston, Texas at the age of 
100 years old but forever young. 
In addition to being an educator and scholar 
of the first rank, Dr. Freeman was world re-
nowned as the legendary coach and teacher 
of the art of forensic debate and who helped 
shape the lives of countless young people 
who were his students, including the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. and the late Congress-
woman Barbara Jordan, who once held the 
seat I now hold. 
Dr. Freeman’s tools were the spoken word. 
His canvas was the minds of the brilliant and 
talented young African Americans seeking a 
higher education. 
A prodigy himself, Dr. Freeman graduated 
from Virginia Union University at the age of 18 
and went on to become a professor at Virginia 
Union University before his 30th birthday. 
He would later receive degrees from Ando-
ver Newton Theological School; Harvard Uni-
versity; Chicago Divinity School; the University 
of Vienna in Austria, and the University of Li-
beria in Africa. 
In 1949, Dr. Freeman was among a group 
of accomplished academics of color hired by 
Texas Southern University (TSU). 
That same year he held a debate in his 
TSU logic class using his own undergraduate 
experience as a guide. 
Debate is defined as a contention by words 
or arguments; or as a formal discussion of a 
motion before a deliberative body according to 
the rules of parliamentary procedure; or a reg-
ulated discussion of a proposition between two 
matched sides. 
But to Dr. Freeman, it was much more than 
a contest; it was a way of life. 
Dr. Freeman understood, as did Socrates 
when he said to Glaucon in Book X of the Re-
public that ‘‘the contest is great my dear 
Glaucon, greater than it seems—this contest 
that concerns becoming good or bad.’’ 
Dr. Freeman’s success was informed by his 
passionate belief that strong debate skills 
translated into a range of life skills that would 
serve students well in their personal lives and 
professional careers. 
Dr. Freeman’s academic roots in moral phi-
losophy and theology came through in his in-
struction of his debate team students. 
Through the art of debate, Dr. Freeman 
taught what the ancient Greeks called arete´, 
which is defined as an ‘‘activity of the soul in 
accord with virtue in a complete life.’’ 
As Aristotle explains in the Nicomachean 
Ethics, happiness comes from exercising the 
full range of one’s vital powers directed toward 
excellence. 
Virtue and excellence and happiness is 
what Dr. Freeman taught his students and that 
is why he and they were special. 
In 1949, the Texas Southern University stu-
dents who participated in Dr. Freeman’s de-
bate class were so impressed with their expe-
rience that they requested that Dr. Freeman 
form and coach a team. 
Dr. Freeman agreed and founded the Texas 
Southern University debate program which 
today is world renowned for its skill and for the 
number of championships won. 
Dr. Freeman was internationally known for 
his debate coaching prowess and for the 
prominent Americans who studied under his 
tutelage. 
As noted, among them were the late Con-
gresswoman Barbara Jordan and the Rev. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
The debating skills that young Barbara Jor-
dan developed under Dr. Freeman’s tutelage 
were so formidable that she became the first 
female to travel with the TSU debate team. 
She and her debate partner Otis King par-
ticipated in and won many awards, including 
the championship at Baylor University, the first 
integrated debate match held in the South. 
Barbara Jordan went on to become a Texas 
State Senator and the first Texas African 
American woman elected to the House of 
Representatives from my state. 
She characterized her experience of learn-
ing under his tutelage as having shaped her 
view of the importance of mastering the skills 
of debate. 
Congresswoman Jordan and Dr. Freeman 
remained close and upon her death he gave 
the eulogy at her funeral. 
Dr. Freeman’s skill as a debate coach came 
to the attention of Denzel Washington when 
he sought a model for the role of a debate 
coach for his role in the critically acclaimed 
film ‘‘The Great Debaters,’’ based on life of 
Melvin B. Tolson, who formed the Wiley Col-
lege debate team. The Wiley College debate 
team defeated the University of Southern Cali-
fornia (USC) debate team for the 1935 na-
tional championship. 
One of the students in Dr. Freeman’s class 
during his tenure as a visiting lecturer at More-
house University was a young Martin Luther 
King, Jr. 
Dr. Freeman had such an influential effect 
on him that years later while he and a group 
of students happened to be in the same res-
taurant he was surprised when Dr. King ap-
proached his table to say hello and reminded 
him that he had been a student in his More-
house class and shared with the students how 
much that experience shaped his life. 
Dr. Freeman’s contributions to the Texas 
Southern University Community included serv-
ing as Founding Dean of both the Weekend 
College and the Honors College. 
Dr. Freeman worked with then TSU Presi-
dent Granville M. Sawyer to develop the pro-
gram and serve as its dean. 
The Honors College, renamed in his honor 
as the Thomas F. Freeman Honors College, 
was developed for academically gifted and 
motivated students to provide them with the 
most rigorous and challenging academic regi-
men. 
In 1972, Dr. Freeman was asked by Rice 
University to join its faculty after it had deseg-
regated. 
Dr. Freeman began a 23-year career asso-
ciation with Rice University. As near as any-
one recalls, he was the first African American 
professor to teach at this prestigious university 
before returning to TSU where he resumed 
teaching and leading the TSU debate team to 
countless victories. 
The life of Dr. Thomas F. Freeman reminds 
us all of the impact a great teacher can have 
in changing the world for the better through 
his or her students. 
Too often a teaching career is viewed by 
too many as an option taken by those who 
cannot excel elsewhere. 
But those of us who know better know that 
it is the great teacher that makes it possible 
for us to succeed anywhere and in any pur-
suit. 
Dr. Freeman was such a teacher. 
But as he lived a full and complete life root-
ed in excellence, virtue, and service, he also 
was a minister of the gospel, community lead-
er, husband, father, mentor, and a friend to 
thousands. 
It can truly be said of Dr. Freeman that his 
has been a consequential life. 
That is why Dr. Freeman is legendary and 
why in memory of this great man that I ask the 
House to observe a moment of silence as a 
tribute to Dr. Freeman’s service to Texas 
Southern University, to America, and to hu-
manity.

COMMENDING 
FOURTH 
DISTRICT 
STUDENTS FOR UNITED STATES 
SERVICE 
ACADEMY 
APPOINT-
MENTS 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor four exceptional students of Ar-
kansas’ Fourth Congressional District. These 
four young men recently accepted appoint-
ments into United States Service Academies, 
bringing their home district extreme pride in 
their academic excellence, their desire to 
serve, and their commitment to patriotism. 
I take this time to congratulate Cannon Tur-
ner of Arkadelphia on his appointment to the 
United States Air Force Academy, Jacob 
Tankersley of Pearcy and Daniel Woolsey of 
Ozark on their appointments to the United 
States Military Academy, and Samuel Tabler 
of Hot Springs Village on his appointment to 
the United States Naval Academy Preparatory 
School. These young Americans embody 
qualities of academic excellence and service 
above self which are necessary for such ap-
pointments. 
These four young men are a tremendous 
source of pride not just for their hometowns, 
but for the entire Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict. Their commitment to excellence is to be 
commended, but it is their love of country, 
their defense of liberty, and their pursuit of a 
freer America that truly sets them apart from 
all others. 
I take this time to honor them for their suc-
cesses, to encourage them on this new pur-
suit, and to thank them for their example to 
the rest of the country of what a patriot truly 
is.

HONORING JIM YOUNG 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I submit 
these remarks in honor of James Marion 
Young of Salem, Virginia, who passed away 
on June 12, 2020 at the age of 89. Jim de-
voted his time and attention to serving the 
people of his hometown through an impressive 
array of community and philanthropic organi-
zations. 
Jim was born on November 15, 1930. He 
was educated at Andrew Lewis High School in 
Salem, where he lettered in football and base-
ball, and at the University of Virginia, where 
he earned undergraduate and law degrees. 
He served in the U.S. Army during the Korean 
War and remained in the Army Reserves for 
22 years, eventually attaining the rank of lieu-
tenant colonel. 
Jim’s profession was the law. He practiced 
for years in Roanoke at Dodson Pence Viar 
Young & Woodrum as a partner and then in 
Salem on his own. But he was also occupied 
with making Salem a better place and improv-
ing the lives of its citizens. Among the organi-
zations he led were the Salem Jaycees, 
Salem Kiwanis, Salem-Roanoke County Bar 
Association, Salem High School PTA, Roa-
noke County Council of PTAs, Salem-Roa-
noke County Chamber of Commerce, and Ro-
anoke Valley Economic Development Partner-
ship. He chaired the Salem Electoral Board for 
15 years and served on the Roanoke College 
Planned Giving Board. At his church, Salem 
Presbyterian, to which he belonged for more 
than 70 years, he served as deacon, elder, 
trustee, and Sunday School teacher. 
The Boy Scouts of America had a special 
place in his heart. He took pride in the 
achievement of Eagle Scout rank by two of his 
grandsons. The organization benefited from 
his volunteerism over a span of more than fifty 
years. He was president of the Blue Ridge 
Mountains Council and provided it with his 
services as an attorney for free. 
Many organizations and causes in Salem 
and the greater Roanoke region were served 
well by Jim, and they honored him in return. 
He was recognized by the Jaycees with the 
Distinguished Service Award, by the Boy 
Scouts with the Silver Beaver Award, and the 
Economic Development Partnership by being 
named Citizen of the Year. He was also in-
ducted into the Salem High Alumni Hall of 
Fame. 
Beside his many charitable pursuits, Jim en-
joyed playing tennis and proved his skill on 
the court as a three-year Virginia United 
States Tennis Association doubles champion 
in the 75- to 80-year-old division and a two- 
year champion in the 80-plus age group. 
I had the opportunity to know Jim person-
ally, including from our mutual service on the 
board of the Blue Ridge Mountains Council. 
He invested a lot of time in his own daughters 
and the children of the community. 
Jim’s family was important to him. He was 
predeceased by one of his daughters, Cathy 
Harman. He is survived by his wife of 63 
years, Barbara, his daughters Debbie Harris, 
Becky Garrison, and Cindy Courtright and 
their husbands as well as Cathy’s husband, 
and eight grandchildren. I offer my condo-
lences to them on their loss. Many in the Roa-
noke Valley had their lives improved by Jim’s 
tireless and selfless service.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
GEORGE 
WASH-
INGTON BIGGS 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 95th birthday of George 
Washington Biggs, and recognize his service 
as a veteran of Army Air Corps and Air Force. 
As a Tuskegee Airman and recipient of the 
Congressional Gold Medal, he is an exem-
plary American and Arizonan to whom we all 
owe a debt of gratitude. 
A native of Nogales, Arizona, Mr. Biggs 
joined the Army Air Corps in 1943 and trained 
at the Tuskegee Institute, the all-black flight 
training school in Alabama. He was one of two 
Arizonans to graduate from the program. After 
training during World War II, Mr. Biggs re-en-
listed in the Army Air Corps as a non-commis-
sioned officer and subsequently received di-
rect commission as an officer in the newly 
formed United States Air Force. He went on to 
achieve the rank of major and flew B–47 and 
B–52 bombers in the Korean and Vietnam 
wars. Throughout his service, Mr. Biggs 
earned three Distinguished Flying Crosses, 7 
Air Medals, and multiple bronze stars for a 
total of over thirty military citations and com-
mendations. 
Since retiring from the military, Mr. Biggs 
has lived and worked in Nogales for the U.S. 
Customs Service. He has raised a family and 
since retired. In 2007, Mr. Biggs and other 
Tuskegee airmen received the Congressional 
Gold Medal, the highest civilian recognition 
awarded by Congress, for the group’s ‘‘unique 
military record that inspired revolutionary re-
form in the Armed Forces.’’ 
I believe that Mr. Biggs’ character and ac-
tions truly embody what it means to serve 
one’s country. Not only did he fly in multiple 
wars, he rose above expectation and obliga-
tion as a Navigator and an officer. In addition 
to his time in the Army Air Corps and Air 
Force, his integrity, modesty, and principled 
character are values that we can all learn from 
and should strive to emulate. 
I would like to express my personal appre-
ciation for the service of George Washington 
Biggs, and my hopes that he has a happy 
95th birthday.

CONGRATULATING 
SADAGICOUS 
OWENS ON HER SELECTION AS A 
2020 COMPETITIVENESS SCHOLAR 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS

Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Sadagicous Owens on 
her selection as one of only 44 students na-
tionwide to the White House Initiative for His-
torically 
Black 
Colleges 
and

gram. Ms. Owens, a student at the University 
of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB), joins a com-
munity of scholars representing 33 HBCUs in 
the country. 
According to the White House, students are 
nominated by their institution’s president and 
chosen based on their academic excellence, 
their professional acumen, their leadership ex-
perience and potential, civic involvement, and 
entrepreneurial spirit. 
Due to COVID–19, this year’s scholars will 
not be able to attend the annual meeting in 
Washington, D.C., but they will instead be par-
ticipating in virtual events throughout the year. 
These seminars and activities will focus on 
creating a platform in which the scholars can 
communicate and share ideas about profes-
sional pathways, government resources, and 
best practices on careers and professionalism.

A TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH A. 
ZANARDI 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 24, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and work of a distinguished 
resident of the 18th Congressional District, Jo-
seph A. Zanardi. 
Joseph was born on April 16, 1943, and 
died on May 31, 2020. He was born and 
raised in Los Gatos, California, and was a 
proud graduate of Los Gatos High School 
where he was an outstanding baseball player. 
After high school he joined the family business 
founded by his grandfather near the turn of 
the 20th century. A lifetime of hard work fol-
lowed, although he was always able to find 
time to coach local youth baseball teams. Jo-
seph retired from Green Valley Disposal in 
1999. 
Joseph adored his grandchildren and his 
dog, and he had a multitude of hobbies includ-
ing hunting, cars, and taking care of his roses. 
He was a member of the Los Gatos Lions 
Club for more than 50 years, and he helped 
launch the Los Gatos Athletic Association 
which has raised millions of dollars for Los 
Gatos High School sports. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the life 
of Joseph A. Zanardi and in extending our 
condolences to his wife Elizabeth, his sons 
and their wives, his grandchildren, and his en-
tire family. He will be greatly missed by all 
who knew him and he will be remembered 
fondly by his entire community.
