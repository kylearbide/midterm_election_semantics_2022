PRAYER 
Pastor 
Zack 
Randles, 
Waterfront 
Church, Washington, D.C., offered the 
following prayer: 
God of Heaven, we come before You 
today seeking wisdom and guidance in 
how we should lead. My heart is drawn 
to the prayer of David in the 25th 
Psalm, and I bring it to Your ear once 
again: 
‘‘No one whose hope is in You will 
ever be put to shame, but they will be 
put to shame who are treacherous 
without excuse. Show me Your ways, O 
Lord, teach me Your paths; guide me in 
Your truth and teach me, for You are 
God my Savior, and my hope is in You 
all day long.’’ 
There is no part of our path that is a 
surprise to You. There is no treachery 
that is beyond Your sight. Share with 
our leaders Your unmatched wisdom, 
and let their actions today bless the 
world. 
I ask all this in the mighty name of 
Jesus. 
Amen.

IN MEMORY OF JOHNNIE LEE 
PATRICK II 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a patriotic American, Johnnie Lee 
Patrick II. Mr. Patrick lived in Estill County, 
Kentucky and passed away on January 10, 
2022, at the age of 46. 
Mr. Patrick served our nation proudly in the 
Kentucky National Guard for more than twenty 
years. Following the terrorist attacks on our 
nation on September 11, 2001, Mr. Patrick 
joined the 149th Infantry ‘‘Charlie Company’’ in 
Ravenna. He was attached to posts in Louis-
ville, Burlington, Richmond, and Jackson. He 
was deployed for two tours in the Middle East. 
Mr. Patrick attained the rank of Sgt. 1st 
Class and was a member of the 207th Engi-
neer Company in Jackson, Kentucky. While on 
active duty with the Southwest Border Mission 
in El Paso, Texas, he passed away on Janu-
ary 10, 2022. He was laid to rest with full mili-
tary honors. 
Mr. Patrick is survived by his wife, Jackie 
Lynn Bowling Patrick, his sons Alexander Mat-
thew Patrick and Ryan Alan Patrick, and a 
large, loving, extended family. 
Sgt. 1st Class Johnnie Lee Patrick II was a 
true patriot and a great American. His service 
and sacrifice are greatly appreciated and must 
never be forgotten. It is my honor to lift up the 
life of Johnnie Lee Patrick II.

RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
CHIL-
DREN’S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to National Children’s Dental 
Health Month. Each February, the American 
Dental Association sponsors National Chil-
dren’s Dental Health Month to raise aware-
ness about the importance of oral health. As 
a part of their awareness efforts, dentists and 
dental team members from across the country 
and in my home State of Idaho join together 
and volunteer their time to provide free care to 
children. As co-chair of the Congressional Oral 
Health Caucus, I am pleased to support Na-
tional Children’s Dental Health Month and any 
related activities taking place throughout the 
month of February that promote good oral 
health for children. 
Give Kids A Smile, a program sponsored by 
the ADA Foundation which this year cele-
brates 20 years of helping children, is at the 
center of National Children’s Dental Health 
Month. Give Kids a Smile Day is an important 
event for all children and dentists throughout 
the country. Because of this program, the ADA 
Foundation is able to provide assistance to 
more than 6,500 dentists and 25,000 dental 
team member volunteers who proudly give 
their time and expertise to make a difference 
in the health of children. Since this program 
started, volunteers have graciously provided 
services to over 7 million kids across the 
country, and in all 50 states and the District of 
Columbia. They have truly made a huge im-
pact in their communities and improved the 
oral health of so many children. 
Throughout 
National 
Children’s 
Dental 
Health Month, dentists and dental team mem-
bers across the country will be providing oral 
health services for children in need, and this 
will continue throughout the year. These serv-
ices 
will 
include 
oral 
health 
education, 
screenings, preventive care and restorative 
services. Some will provide this in their own 
dental practice, others will go right into 
schools and the community to reach the kids 
that need it most. There are also many major 
events at dental hygiene schools where hun-
dreds of kids may receive oral health services. 
Continued public awareness on this issue is 
critical. On behalf of the Congressional Oral 
Health Caucus, I would once again like to 
state our full endorsement for National Chil-
dren’s Dental Health Month, and push for con-
tinued care for the excellent oral health of chil-
dren.

HONORING THE BLACK STUDENTS’ 
ALLIANCE AT MICHIGAN STATE 
UNIVERSITY 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a student organization that gives 
the Black community at Michigan State Uni-
versity a platform to let their voices be heard: 
The Black Students’ Alliance. 
Founded in 1967 in the basement of MSU’s, 
then associate professor, Dr. Robert L. 
Green’s home, the Black Students’ Alliance 
was created as a way to voice support for 
those protesting racial injustice and increase 
representation of black students on campus. 
Green’s mentee and co-founder, Barry D. 
Amis, was frustrated that he could only see 
what seemed to be about 400 black students 
in a campus population of over 40,000, not at 
all reflective of Michigan’s 10 percent African- 
American population. 
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assas-
sinated on April 4th, 1968, Amis and other 
members of the Black Students’ Association 
orqanized a protest on MSU’s campus. Stu-
dent groups came together and demanded 
that they do more to integrate the history and 
culture of the Black community onto campus. 
Not only did the students request courses on 
African American studies, they challenged the 
university’s lack of Black residence hall staff, 
counselors, and professors. They wanted to 
be represented. They wanted to be seen. 
They wanted to be heard. 
Today, more than 50 years after its found-
ing, the Black Students’ Alliance continues to 
be the main voice for Black students on 
MSU’s campus. With enrollment for Black stu-
dents now close to 8 percent of the student 
population, the BSA’s main focus is on sup-
porting academic growth and increasing grad-
uation rates for black students. 
I am so proud of the way BSA President 
Kenneth Franklin, and his board of directors, 
advocate for and support the black student 
population by connecting them with the local 
black community in all aspects of campus life: 
socially, academically, and through mentorship 
programs. By focusing their efforts on results- 
driven actions to create a diverse support sys-
tem, the Black Students’ Alliance is working to 
redefine the Black experience at Michigan 
State University. 
For its steadfast support for generations of 
Black students at MSU, and for its lasting con-
tributions to the entire MSU community, I sub-
mit the story of the Black Students’ Alliance so 
that it may be remembered forever.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
BISHOP CALVIN W. WOODS, SR. 
AS-PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
BIR-
MINGHAM 
CHAPTER 
OF 
THE 
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADER-
SHIP CONFERENCE 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the leadership of Bishop Calvin 
W. Woods, Sr., the president of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Bir-
mingham Chapter, who is retiring after 15 
wonderful years of service to the Birmingham 
community. 
Bishop Woods obtained his Bachelor of Arts 
from Miles College before continuing his edu-
cation at Birmingham Baptist College. He went 
on to complete multiple degrees at the Uni-
versal Bible Institute, Union Baptist Seminary, 
and the School of Truth. Diversifying his edu-
cation, Bishop Woods is also a graduate of 
the Urban Training Center for Christian Mis-
sions and obtained a certificate for police com-
munications from Samford University. 
In 1956, Bishop Woods joined his brother 
Reverend Abraham L. Woods, Jr., and Rev-
erend Fred L. Shuttlesworth to co-found the 
Alabama Christian Movement for Human 
Rights (ACMHR). Through this, Bishop Wood 
began the journey of what would become six 
decades of courageous leadership throughout 
the Civil Rights Movement. Working closely 
with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Bishop Woods 
was an audacious leader during the Civil 
Rights Movement. Supporting the work of 
Reverend 
Fred 
L. 
Shuttlesworth, 
Bishop 
Woods challenged segregation directly, partici-
pating in numerous demonstrations, including

the Birmingham Campaign and the March on 
Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. 
Though his participation in the movement re-
sulted in him being beaten, arrested, and fired 
from his job, he continued to fight for justice 
and equality for all, planning strategies for 
public protests following ‘the shooting of five 
African Americans who had been protesting at 
a supermarket during the 1960s and filing a 
lawsuit on behalf of the youth suspended from 
school during the demonstration to ensure that 
they could be re-instated. 
As a result of his tenacity and dedication, 
Bishop Woods was appointed by Dr. King as 
the SCLC City Convener for the Birmingham 
Ministers Leadership Conference. In this posi-
tion, Bishop Woods was responsible for edu-
cating ministers concerning Black history, pick-
eting, housing, direct non-violent protesting, 
voter registration, and negotiations to ensure 
that they were fully equipped to continue lead-
ing their congregations throughout the move-
ment. 
Apart from his work as a Civil Rights leader, 
Bishop Woods has continued to play a vital 
role in the Birmingham community through his 
various community affiliations and as the pas-
tor of Shiloh Baptist Church in Birmingham, 
Alabama, where he has led the congregation 
for the past 34 years. Bishop Woods has 
served in multiple capacities including, board 
member of the Birmingham Board of Edu-
cation at Parker High School in Discipline and 
Administration; evening supervisor for the Park 
High Community School; counselor, group 
worker, and center director for the Jefferson 
County Committee for Economic Opportunity; 
and board member of the Birmingham Civil 
Rights Institute. His additional community affili-
ations include former president of the New Era 
Baptist State Convention of Alabama; former 
ViceChair of the Board of Trustees of the Bir-
mingham Easonian Baptist Bible College; and 
former National Chaplain of the SCLC. Today, 
at the age of 80, he continues to champion 
the cause for human rights serving currently 
as Vice President of the National Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference and as a 
member of the National Board of Directors of 
the 
Southern 
Christian 
Leadership 
Con-
ference. On a personal note, the contributions 
that Bishop Woods made to ensure the equal 
rights of all Americans during the Civil Rights 
Movement are truly exemplary. To call him an 
icon of the movement is an understatement. 
His unwavering commitment to improving the 
lives of Black Alabamians has earned him a 
unique place in history. It was because of his 
courage, sacrifice, and conviction that so 
many of us now have the leadership positions 
we do today. We owe Bishop Woods a debt 
that we cannot repay. I hope the knowledge 
that his legacy of extraordinary service will live 
on and the many people he has impacted will 
be and a source of great pride during his re-
tirement. Thank you for being such a powerful 
agent for change. On behalf of Alabama’s 7th 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the extraordinary lead-
ership and service of Bishop Calvin W. 
Woods, Sr., and his contributions to not only 
the community of Birmingham as President of 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
Birmingham Chapter but to the world as a 
Civil Rights leader. 
IN HONOR OF THE MARRIAGE OF 
NICOLE YADON AND KYLE SMITH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Nicole Yadon and Kyle 
Smith on the occasion of their marriage. This 
special day is worthy of commendation. 
Nicole (Nikki) Yadon is a Michigan native 
and University of Michigan graduate. She met 
her husband, Kyle Smith, in 2013 while both 
were students at the University of Michigan. 
They had their first official date at The Prickly 
Pear in Ann Arbor. After Kyle graduated from 
Michigan in 2015, Kyle and Nikki dated long 
distance for a year and a half while Nikki was 
still in school. They travelled back and forth 
from Ann Arbor to San Francisco, Columbus, 
San Antonio, and Washington, D.C. to be to-
gether—they made sure to visit all of the best 
diners in each city along the way. 
Nikki has always had a love for politics and 
government. She interned at the Democratic 
Governors’ Association in the summer of 
2016, then for State Rep. Donna Lasinski’s 
campaign in the fall of 2016, culminating with 
an internship in my office. After interning in the 
district office from January through May 2017 
and graduating from the University of Michi-
gan, Nikki moved to Washington, D.C. to con-
tinue her career in politics and worked for the 
people of Michigan’s 12th District on Capitol 
Hill from June through August 2017. Since 
then, she has since worked for the Democratic 
Governors’ Association in a variety of capac-
ities, and currently serves as Director of 
Events. 
In September 2019, two years after Nikki 
and Kyle moved in together and became dog 
parents to Bandit, their favorite border collie, 
Kyle proposed to Nikki at her parents’ house 
in Troy, Michigan. Through working from home 
together during COVID in 2020, their love for 
each other continued to grow. Kyle and Nikki 
officially got married in a small, COVID-safe 
ceremony in Washington, D.C. on May 22, 
2021. They are looking forward to spending 
their 11-month anniversary with friends and 
family at the rescheduled wedding celebration 
in Newport, RI on April 30, 2022. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Nicole and Kyle. I join with the 
couple’s family and friends in extending my 
best wishes to them on this special day and 
wish them happiness and blessings in the 
years to come.

HONORING TRINITY AME CHURCH, 
LANSING 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor a pillar of Lansing’s African-American 
faith community: Trinity AME Church. For over 
150 years, the area’s oldest black church has 
knit itself into the fabric of its community, serv-
ing folks in ways that are too many to count. 
Trinity was founded in 1866 with only 21 
members, and today it boasts a congregation 
more than 400 strong. Its roots in the Lansing 
community run deep, having been cultivated 
by generations of devoted congregants. Take 
a look around the pews on a Sunday and 
you’ll see folks who have been coming to Trin-
ity for decades. They come to say a prayer or 
chat with an old friend—to enjoy those little 
moments of community and humanity. 
Some have been members of Trinity AME 
for decades, like former MSU Athletic Director, 
and 2017 inductee into the MSU Hall of Fame, 
Clarence Underwood. He first joined in 1958 
while studying at MSU, and never looked 
back. 
Trinity’s impact reaches far beyond the walls 
of the church building off West Holmes Road. 
From youth programs, scholarships, clothing 
drives and more, Trinity and its congregation 
are devoted to supporting the people of Lan-
sing. The congregation has also reached out 
beyond their immediate community, like help-
ing the residents of Flint during its water crisis. 
With such a spirited and steadfast con-
gregation, it is no surprise that Trinity is head-
ed up by such a vibrant pastor. Pastor Lila 
Martin is the first woman to take the pulpit, 
and she has risen to the occasion. 
From getting kids involved in the services, 
to returning the church to its role as a vital 
part of the community, she is shepherding her 
congregation into a new era in its long history. 
Pastor Martin ends her sermons with, 
‘‘Maybe you’re without a church home, then I 
invite you to allow Trinity to be your church 
home, we will accept you.’’ Her steadfast effort 
to open Trinity’s doors to all who may need it 
is felt each and every week. 
With in-person services returning and the 
congregation stronger than ever, the future 
looks bright for Trinity. Its history, members, 
and presence in the community is an essential 
part of Lansing, and I am proud that its impact 
will be forever known.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
VICTIMS 
OF 
THE BAKU AND SUMGAIT PO-
GROMS 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the 
Sumgait pogrom and the 32nd anniversary of 
the Baku pogrom. 
Hundreds of Armenian civilians living in the 
city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan suffered horrific 
acts of violence when they were indiscrimi-
nately killed, raped, maimed, and burned alive 
in a pogrom that started on February 27, 
1988. Almost two years later, a seven-day po-
grom broke out in Baku during which Arme-
nians were beaten, murdered, and expelled 
from the city beginning January 12, 1990. 
Over 90 Armenian civilians were killed, over 
700 were injured, and countless other victims 
were permanently displaced by the ethnic vio-
lence that followed. 
The Azerbaijani Government was complicit 
in each of these atrocities by using violent 
rhetoric in rallies leading up to the pogrom and 
by doing nothing to halt the ensuing violence 
against Armenian citizens. Azerbaijan has 
taken steps over the last two decades to cover 
up these crimes against humanity and dismiss

the atrocities committed in Sumgait and Baku. 
Even more disturbing, the Azeri Government 
lauded the perpetrators of this event and simi-
lar violent attacks. 
President Aliyev’s regime continues to use 
hateful rhetoric against Armenians to this day, 
including in the build up to Azerbaijan’s deadly 
attacks on Artsakh in the fall of 2020. Azeri 
forces, Turkish drones, and Turkish-backed 
foreign terrorists conducted a premeditated at-
tack that violated international law. The result-
ing indiscriminate bombing campaigns against 
large population centers killed thousands of 
Armenians and displaced tens of thousands 
more. It also included appalling war crimes 
against Armenians at the hands of Azerbaijani 
forces and foreign mercenaries that included 
beheadings, torture, and other abhorrent acts 
of violence. 
I continue to stand with the Armenian peo-
ple in condemning the horrific pogroms and in 
mourning the loss of those who were sense-
lessly killed in Artsakh and subsequent Azeri 
attacks on Armenian soil. It is critical for the 
United States to recognize and denounce vio-
lent assaults against all civilians. If we do not 
condemn or punish crimes against humanity 
and ethnic violence, we become passive by-
standers, failing to live up to the lessons of the 
20th century and our pledge to uphold human 
rights and democratic values all over the 
world. If we do not take a firm stand against 
those who commit atrocities, it will embolden 
them and encourage others to commit heinous 
acts in the future. These lessons are espe-
cially important as we prepare to commemo-
rate the 107th Anniversary of the Armenian 
Genocide in April. 
I will continue to work with my colleagues 
on the Congressional Armenian Issues Cau-
cus to honor the victims of the Baku and 
Sumgait pogroms and the victims of Azer-
baijani aggressions in Artsakh, I will also con-
tinue to condemn all acts of violence against 
people who are targeted simply because of 
who they are. I hope my colleagues will join 
me in rejecting violent rhetoric, intimidation 
and outright violations of human rights. In 
doing so, we renew our commitment to 
achieving a lasting peace in the Caucasus.

30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
KHOJALY MASSACRE 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, this week 
marks the 30th anniversary of the massacre of 
hundreds of people in the town of Khojaly, 
Azerbaijan. Khojaly, which is in the Nagorno- 
Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, was once 
home to 7,000 people. On February 26, 1992, 
in the largest killing of ethnic Azerbaijani civil-
ians during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, 
Armenian armed forces massacred over 600 
unarmed people—including 106 women, 63 
children and 70 elderly people—and left less 
than 2,000 survivors. Hundreds more became 
disabled due to their injuries. More than 100 
children lost a parent and 25 children lost both 
parents, and at least 8 families were entirely 
killed. 
Although a cease-fire was negotiated in 
1994, it is my hope that Armenia and Azer-
baijan can come together and find peace. The 
conflict remains unresolved, and we saw an 
unfortunate escalation of conflict in 2020 in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh region. Long-term peace, 
security, and regional cooperation are in the 
best interests of the entire region of the South 
Caucasus and the world. 
Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the 
United States and its allies. This cooperation 
has included: playing a leadership role in non- 
proliferation issues; providing troops to serve 
shoulder-to-shoulder 
with 
U.S. 
forces 
in 
Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan; allowing transit 
of non-lethal equipment used by coalition 
forces through Azerbaijan to Afghanistan; con-
struction of the Southern Gas Corridor from 
the Caspian Sea to Italy, thereby providing 
Europe with an alternative to Russian energy 
sources; and supplying 40 percent of Israel’s 
oil. Azerbaijan also has a thriving Jewish com-
munity and has outstanding relations with 
Israel. 
As Azerbaijanis throughout the world com-
memorate the massacre and continue to 
grieve the loss of loved ones, I hope they can 
find peace amidst this tragedy.

HONORING GEORGE JEWETT 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor George Jewett, a legend of the grid-
iron, a physician, and an entrepreneur who 
blazed a trail through the history of both foot-
ball and race relations, breaking barriers and 
records at every turn, including a forward pass 
through Howell, Michigan. 
Intelligent, driven, and athletically blessed, 
George was a classic all-American, and he 
was also an African-American at a time when 
Jim Crow was tightening its grip on the coun-
try. 
Valedictorian of the class of 1889 at Ann 
Arbor High School, Jewett captained the foot-
ball and baseball teams—as well as the de-
bate club. He was the fastest sprinter in the 
Midwest, and was fluent in German, Italian, 
and French. He went on to attend the Univer-
sity of Michigan, becoming the first African 
American in the school’s history to letter in 
football, and ultimately one of its greatest 
stars. 
Though he excelled on the field and in the 
classroom, Jewett endured racial taunts and 
physical abuse on and off the field. A news-
paper during Jewett’s time aptly described him 
as ‘‘a brilliant player who stands punishment 
with indifference.’’ 
Jewett transferred to Northwestern Univer-
sity in 1893 where he suited up for the Wild-
cats, becoming the first Black player for that 
school’s football team as well. Upon grad-
uating from medical school in 1895, he re-
turned to Michigan where Howell Public 
Schools Superintendent Robert Briggs hired 
the doctor as coach of the first official Howell 
High School football team. 
Now, high school sports had different rules 
and norms in the late 1800s, with teams com-
posed of both student athletes and local resi-
dents who would join them. And that is how 
Dr. George Jewett became not just the first 
Black coach of a Michigan high school football 
team, but also a teammate. 
To fundraise for the new team, Mr. Jewett 
hosted a gala at the Howell Opera House, a 
lavish event featuring food, music, and dem-
onstrations of football plays. 
By all accounts it was a smashing success, 
and if it hadn’t been for that event, we might 
never have known about the remarkable role 
George Jewett played in Howell’s history. 
A program from his fundraiser was recently 
found under the floorboards of the Howell 
Opera House during its renovation, connecting 
this trailblazing legend to the community, and 
forever cementing his role in Howell history. 
Last fall, the George Jewett Trophy—the 
first rivalry trophy in major college football 
named for an African American player— 
debuted in Ann Arbor when the University of 
Michigan played Northwestern University. And 
from now on, the George Jewett Trophy will 
be played for, each and every time the two 
programs meet on the field. 
I’m so proud to see George Jewett’s cul-
tural, academic, and athletic accomplishments 
solidified, immortalized and set in stone. 
It is my honor to record his name and his 
story so that all who read it may catch inspira-
tion from his groundbreaking achievements— 
So that we too may tackle our current chal-
lenges with the same dedication and persever-
ance he brought to every aspect of his life— 
And so that each of us may lace up our 
shoes, march onto the field, and pass on his 
legacy of triumph over adversity, and indiffer-
ence to punishment.

REMEMBERING DEAN ‘DINO’ 
CORTOPASSI 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Dean ‘‘Dino’’ 
Cortopassi and his legacy as a loving family 
man, career farmer, and champion of commu-
nities in the Delta area. Patti and I are deeply 
saddened by Dino’s passing, and our hearts 
are with Joan and their family during this dif-
ficult time. 
Dino was born and raised in Stockton, Cali-
fornia, as the son of immigrant farmers. After 
graduating high school Dino proceeded to 
study farming at the prestigious agricultural 
school at the University of California, Davis. In 
1958, Dino took on his first job as a grain 
buyer through which he immersed himself in 
the world of managing goods, markets, and 
the art of running a successful agribusiness. In 
the same year, he married his high school 
sweetheart Joan DeCarli and they both went 
on to raise four remarkable children, Gino, 
Katie, Becky, and David. 
While Dino continued to build on his suc-
cess as a dynamic and innovative farmer and 
businessman, he also fell in love with the 
Delta. An avid fisherman and hunter, Dino be-
came a powerful advocate and protector of the 
Delta’s waterfowl and their habitats. His efforts 
were crucial to preventing the proposed Delta 
tunnels project from devastating the region’s 
ecosystems. Dino founded the Wetlands Pres-
ervation Foundation, which continues to help 
conserve the Delta’s naturaI habitats. 
In 2005 he was named the Stocktonian of 
the Year. Dino’s Life’s work undoubtedly had

Joan and the Cortopassi family.

HONORING DEPUTY COUNTY MAN-
AGER 
JONATHAN 
MARSHALL 
FOR 34 YEARS OF SERVICE TO 
CABARRUS COUNTY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Jonathan Marshall for 34 years of 
service to Cabarrus County, including a dec-
ade of service as Deputy County Manager. I 
have seen his extraordinary leadership first-
hand and how much he means to our commu-
nity. 
Mr. Marshall began his career with Cabarrus 
County in 1988 as a land-use planner and re-
tires after more than three decades of service. 
Exemplary in his innate understanding of the 
relationship between people and land, he held 
the positions of Senior Planner, Planning 
Services Director, and Commerce Director be-
fore being named Deputy County Manager in 
December 2011. 
Over the course of his career, Mr. Marshall 
has exhibited exceptional commitment and 
dedication to improving our community. He 
has led Cabarrus County through a time of un-
precedented growth and his work will be felt 
for generations to come. Mr. Marshall’s early 
efforts on the western area plan, for example, 
helped to sustain economic growth resulting 
from land development around Charlotte Motor 
Speedway and Concord Mills. He has also 
fostered a unique culture of collaboration be-
tween community stakeholders, and relation-
ships between the County and municipalities 
have flourished under his extraordinary leader-
ship. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Mr. Marshall for his years of ex-
emplary service to Cabarrus County. I know I 
speak for our entire community in wishing he 
and his wife Debbie continued success and 
happiness as they move on to their next great 
adventure. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Jonathan Marshall upon his retire-
ment as Deputy County Manager of Cabarrus 
County.

HONORING REV. DR. MELVIN T. 
JONES 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Reverend Doctor Melvin T. Jones as 
the dedicated Senior Pastor of the Union Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Lansing, Michigan. 
He has stood at the forefront of fighting for 
justice since he was a child, and continues to 
do so throughout the Greater Lansing commu-
nity today. He is a living testimony of using 
one’s life to serve others. 
At 78 years old, Pastor Jones is a model 
and inspiration for generations of citizens and 
faith leaders in our community. He has served 
at Union Missionary Baptist Church for 37 
years, and is often referred to as ‘‘The Patri-
arch,’’ because nothing happens in the Lan-
sing community without seeking his wisdom, 
guidance, and support. 
Every community has a guiding light, that 
someone who serves as the force to bring oth-
ers together to drive change, and in the Lan-
sing faith community, that someone is Pastor 
Melvin T. Jones. More than a decade ago, he 
became founder and Chairman of GLADE, 
currently known as ACTION of Greater Lan-
sing, an interdenominational justice ministry of 
churches. Pastor Jones has served as Presi-
dent of The Greater Lansing Clergy Forum, 
Co-President of ACTION of Greater Lansing, 
and most recently helped shape the Assembly 
of Lansing Pastors to address gun violence. 
He has received numerous awards and hon-
ors, both civic and national including an Hon-
orary Doctor of Divinity degree from Dallas 
Baptist Christian College, and he is currently 
completing a Doctor of Ministry degree pro-
gram at Ashland Theological Seminary. 
Pastor Jones has accomplished all of this 
while still devoting himself to his family: his 
wife Sallie of more than 50 years, and their 
five grown children. 
As Pastor Jones prepares for retirement, he 
will be remembered for his faithful leadership 
that positively changed the direction of the city 
and impacted individuals and families for the 
better. He will be known for the inspiration and 
love he brought to Lansing, but also for the 
many pastoral leaders he mentored over many 
decades. 
I have no doubt that even after retirement 
he will continue to be a voice for Lansing, and 
a strong supporter for those in need. While we 
will miss his voice in the house of worship, it 
is my great honor to record his many good 
works in so that they may live forever.

CELEBRATING WHITE OAK 
LIBRARY’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate The White Oak Library on 100 
years of service to the community. 
In 1922, the Lockport Woman’s Club began 
a volunteer library and led a seven-year fight 
to solidify the library as a mainstay in the com-
munity. The library has persevered, putting the 
needs of the people first, changing locations 
and selling land to mirror the ever changing 
community landscape. A couple of location 
and name changes later, the Lockport Wom-
en’s Club’s vision has surpassed their initial 
dreams, with not one, but three libraries serv-
ing the greater Crest Hill, Lockport, and 
Romeoville communities. 
The White Oak Library’s mission is to be a 
community anchor while balancing innovation 
and tradition. The library leaders and staff 
have tirelessly met this mission with offerings 
ranging from Citizenship Prep and English- 
Second 
Language 
classes, 
STEM 
Fest, 
Grandparents Day, and various children, teen 
and adult programming. The thoughtful and 
far-reaching goals of the White Oak Library 
are met every day. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent 
the communities White Oak Library serves. 
and I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing this milestone with best wishes for 
many more to come.

CONGRATULATING DR. NORIS 
PRICE 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Baldwin County 
Schools Superintendent Dr. Noris Price for 
being named the Georgia 2022 Super-
intendent of the Year. 
Dr. Price has more than 35 years of experi-
ence in public education. She has served as 
an Associate Superintendent for Clarke Coun-
ty Schools, a Principle in Fairfax, Virginia, and 
as an elementary school teacher in New York 
City. 
Dr. Price was selected by the Georgia 
School Superintendents Association for her 
leadership ability, communication skills, and 
unwavering dedication to education. 
During her tenure in Baldwin County, Dr. 
Price made tremendous strides to increase the 
high school graduation rate from 66 percent to 
90 percent. She is also responsible for secur-
ing more than $ eight million in grants for 
Baldwin County Schools. 
This year brings additional recognition for 
Dr. Price’s success and dedication as she was 
named a top four finalist for the 2022 U.S. Na-
tional Superintendent of the Year award. 
These educators represent the bold and inno-
vative work that is needed to ensure student 
success in communities across the country. 
I am proud of Dr. Price’s dedication to the 
future generation of Georgia’s 10th Congres-
sional District, and I wish her continued suc-
cess.

HONORING THELMA LETT 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to share the story of a courageous Black 
woman from Brighton who would not sit down 
when faced with racism, hatred, and bigotry. 
Thelma Lett did not grow up in Livingston 
County, but moved there from Detroit in 1976 
with her husband. She was an avid church-
goer and involved in many community organi-
zations, as she and her husband raised their 
two children, Paul and Keith. 
But it was her involvement with the Living-
ston Diversity Council, then known as Living-
ston 2001, that drew headlines and propelled 
this quiet woman into the local spotlight. 
Eager to champion the cause of diversity in 
the mostly white county, she joined the organi-
zation in 1988, its founding year—the same 
year a cross was burned on the property of a 
Black family in the county. She’s credited with 
helping to grow the group and support for the 
cause with her dynamic, can-do style.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E175 
February 25, 2022 
Here’s what some former friends and col-
leagues had to say about Thelma: ‘‘A tremen-
dous go-getter.’’ 
‘‘You just had a smile on your face after 
talking to her,’’ and, 
‘‘I would put a great deal of the success of 
the membership on her leadership.’’ 
But it’s what SHE had to say to a group 
who showed up to protest a community forum 
that will go down in history. In 1994, members 
of the National Association for the Advance-
ment of White People showed up at a forum 
in Howell and openly declared that they didn’t 
want Black people living in their community. 
Lett stood up, looked directly at the crowd, 
and calmly, but passionately informed them 
she would not be run out of her home. 
‘‘When I walk down the street, I’d like not to 
have cat calls or the N-word shouted at me,’’ 
she said, staring into the eyes of men and 
women 
wearing 
hats 
emblazoned 
with 
‘‘NAAWP’’ and ‘‘Anglo-Saxon.’’ 
She told the crowd how some of her family 
members served in the U.S. military, and were 
wounded in combat fighting for the American 
ideal that all people are created equal. 
And when she called for some simple re-
spect, saying ‘‘I give dignity and I want dig-
nity,’’ the crowd rocketed to its feet. 
Lett never backed down from her devotion 
to diversity, continuing her activism and com-
munity involvement until her death at age 79. 
In fact, if you visit the Detroit Impact Youth 
Center on the city’s west side, you’ll find the 
Thelma Lett Library inside, a tribute to the 
many young people she taught to read and 
write. 
And if you visit Howell, you’ll find the Living-
ston Diversity Council continuing her work, in-
spired by the courage of her convictions, and 
still standing up to intolerance and hate. 
Thelma Lett lived and died in Brighton, 
Michigan and made it abundantly clear her 
love for this country and all it stands for was 
far greater than the hatred she was shown. 
Brighton was her home, and today it is my 
honor in sharing her story.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
NAMING 
OF 
AUTHERINE LUCY HALL ON THE 
CAMPUS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
ALABAMA 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the naming of Autherine Lucy 
Hall on the campus of the University of Ala-
bama. Autherine Lucy Foster was the first Afri-
ca-American student to integrate the Univer-
sity of Alabama in 1952. 
After graduating from Miles College in 1952 
with a degree in English, Autherine followed 
her aspirations of continuing her education by 
applying for graduate school at the University 
of Alabama. After sending in her initial request 
on September 4, 1952, she and her friend 
Pollie Anne Myers received letters welcoming 
them to the University of Alabama. However, 
upon submitting applications that indicated 
race, both women’s admissions were revoked 
by university officials due to the university’s 
‘‘Whites only’’ policy. Once the community 
learned of both students not being admitted to 
the university due to their race, two of the 
most prominent civil rights lawyers, Arthur 
Shores and Thurgood Marshall, began work-
ing on their behalf testing one of the most 
consequential Supreme Court cases in our 
history, Brown v Board of Education of To-
peka. On June 28, 1955, just over a year after 
the Brown decision, U.S. District Judge Harlan 
Grooms heard their case ruling in favor of the 
women upholding the precedent of the Su-
preme Court and solidifying the legal eradi-
cation of the ‘‘separate but equal’’ policy. 
In hopes of further discouraging Autherine 
and Pollie, the university hired private inves-
tigators to look into their backgrounds to find 
information that would ensure they could not 
attend. As a result of their efforts, Pollie was 
disqualified from admission, leaving Autherine 
to attend the university alone. Upon her at-
tendance, Autherine experienced high-intensity 
adversity. She was denied dining and dor-
mitory privileges and suffered multiple verbal 
and physical attacks from her White counter-
parts, which resulted in her being removed 
from the university by the Board of Trustees, 
claiming it was for her protection. With 
Autherine fearing for her life, Attorney Shores 
and Marshall stepped in on her behalf once 
again, filing an official complaint stating that 
the university had been complicit in permitting 
the 
crowd 
to 
intimidate 
and 
threaten 
Autherine. Unfortunately, they were unable to 
prove the university’s role in the mob action, 
and despite withdrawing the complaint, the ad-
ministration argued that through their actions, 
Autherine had defamed the school and its ad-
ministration resulting in her expulsion. 
Though she felt defeated at the moment, 
less than ten years later, her efforts to inte-
grate the University of Alabama finally became 
a reality. Vivian Malone and James Hood en-
rolled at the University of Alabama in June 
1963. Vivian went on to become the first Afri-
can American to graduate from the University 
of Alabama, continuing the work of Autherine 
and opening the door for more students to fol-
low in their footsteps. However, unbeknownst 
to her, it would take over thirty years for her 
own story to be completed at the University of 
Alabama. 
Thirty-two years after her expulsion from the 
University of Alabama, she was asked to 
come back to the university as a guest speak-
er. With multiple faculty members advocating 
on her behalf to overturn her expulsion, she 
returned in 1989 to enroll as a student. Enroll-
ing the same year as her daughter Grazia, 
they graduated together in 1992 to receive 
their respective graduate and undergraduate 
degrees. Ensuring that her legacy of bravery 
and tenacity lives on, the University of Ala-
bama awarded Autherine with an honorary 
doctorate in 2019, a $25,000 scholarship in 
her name and honored her with two land mak-
ers on campus—a historic marker in front of 
the newly named Autherine Lucy Hall and the 
Autherine Lucy Clock Tower. 
On a personal note, as Alabama’s first 
Black Congresswoman, it is a source of tre-
mendous pride to celebrate the courage and 
sacrifice of Autherine Lucy Foster in inte-
grating the University of Alabama. The naming 
of a campus building in her honor 70 years 
after she first enrolled in the university shows 
that delayed justice can lead to racial healing 
and reconciliation. It was because of her brav-
ery and sheer audacity in the face of an in-
credible injustice that Black students attend 
and graduate from the University of Alabama 
today. The university, the State of Alabama, 
and the nation owe Autherine Lucy Foster a 
debt of gratitude that can never truly be re-
paid. The naming of Autherine Lucy Hall will 
stand as a powerful reminder of the progress 
that can be achieved when this nation lives up 
to its best ideals of equality and justice for all. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing 
the 
extraordinary 
courage 
of 
Autherine Lucy Foster and the naming of 
Autherine Lucy Hall on the campus of the Uni-
versity of Alabama.

CER 4 JUAN ALEJANDRO ON THE 
OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM

Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a true public servant, Chief 
Warrant Officer 4 Juan Alejandro, and con-
gratulate him on his retirement from the Guam 
Army National Guard (GUARNG) after over 21 
years of service to our island and nation. 
Launching his military career in 1998, CW4 
Alejandro first enlisted as a Military Occupa-
tional Skill (MOS) 25R, Audio, Visual Elec-
tronics Technician. He then served two years 
with the 3rd Psychological Operations Bat-
talion in Fort Bragg, NC, and went on to com-
plete both Warrant Officer Candidate School 
and the Army Aviation Flight Training Pro-
gram. With a firm determination to build on his 
skills and expand his professional capacities, 
he later earned a bachelor’s degree in Profes-
sional Aeronautics from Embry-Riddle Aero-
nautical University alongside a minor in Man-
agement. Stepping into the field of aviation, 
CW4 Alejandro served as a Pilot in Command 
with the 1–25 Attack Aviation Battalion and 2– 
6 Cavalry Squadron, participated in three Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom campaigns, and accu-
mulated over 2,000 flight hours across 350 
missions in combat. 
Resigning from Active Duty in 2009, CW4 
Alejandro joined the Pennsylvania Army Na-
tional Guard as a Maintenance Test Pilot, In-
structor Pilot, and Commander of the Pennsyl-
vania Counterdrug Joint Task Force Aviation. 
Throughout 
his 
six-year 
tenure, 
CW4 
Alejandro coordinated numerous local, state, 
and federal counterdrug operations respon-
sible for over $20 million in drug and illegal 
weapon seizures, facilitated the successful 
transition between aircraft models, and devel-
oped crucial training and maintenance pro-
grams for the State’s integration of the Lakota 
helicopter. 
In 2015, CW4 Alejandro brought his exper-
tise to the GUARNG and has since been a 
critical asset in standing up its Army Aviation 
program. Taking on significant roles as a State 
Aviation Safety Officer and Standardization 
Pilot, he has provided valuable guidance and 
support to our unit and enabled them to attain 
nearly 2,000 hours of flight, pass a multitude 
of high-level inspections, and assist the com-
munity with the completion of 13 Search and 
Rescue missions.

include two Meritorious Service Medals, five

HONORING THE PAGE FENCE 
GIANTS BASEBALL TEAM 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Page Fence Giants, an all- 
black baseball team that was founded in 1894 
in Adrian, Michigan. At a time when Jim Crow 
laws swept the nation and racial segregation 
largely divided sports, the all-black Page 
Fence Giants persevered, ultimately claiming 
their place in history in the Michigan Baseball 
Hall of Fame. 
The team was founded by Bud Fowler and 
Grant ‘‘Home Run’’ Johnson, both of whom 
went on to play for the Giants. The team was 
a knockout, winning over 100 games in each 
of their four seasons. And in 1897 they went 
on a winning streak, claiming 82 consecutive 
victories. The team’s four-year run was an 
early success towards integration—but was 
phased out of the league decades before 
Jackie Robinson’s 1947 debut. 
The Page Fence Giants traveled around the 
Midwest and Canada on a 60-foot railcar. 
While the team was celebrated and welcomed 
in some communities, they were discriminated 
against and disparaged in others, often barred 
from eating at the local restaurants or sleeping 
in the hotels. This railcar provided the basic 
necessities for the ball players when they 
were unwelcome to stay or dine in the whites- 
only establishments. 
One of the full-time cooks on the train was 
William Wendell Gaskin, who is believed to be 
Lansing-born. Gaskin traveled with the team, 
cooking meals and even joining the team in a 
couple of games as the Giants’ pitcher. 
Last year, on June 19, our very own Lan-
sing Lugnuts paid tribute to the Page Fence 
Giants by wearing historically accurate black 
and burgundy Giants jerseys. 
While the Giants dissolved after four solid 
seasons in 1898, their contributions to sports 
and to Michigan’s history will be forever re-
membered.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF ROY 
TAYLOR 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of 
Roy Taylor, a long-time friend and business 
leader in Somerset, Kentucky. 
Roy and I shared a passion for broadcasting 
and advancing communications in rural south-
ern Kentucky. He was incredibly talented in 
the world of technology and telecommuni-
cations. In fact, during his time with the U.S. 
Army, he was part of Special Forces and 
worked with the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort 
Bragg, North Carolina, where he led highly 
classified military operations. Our nation owes 
Roy a great debt of gratitude for his brave 
service and dedication to our country. 
When he returned home, Roy used his mili-
tary training and education to advance tele-
communications in the Lake Cumberland re-
gion. He first worked in sales and transmitter 
maintenance with WSSC radio and later in-
vested in WTLO radio in Somerset, Kentucky. 
A visionary for telecommunications in our rural 
region, Roy was always one step ahead to 
connect our communities to the rest of the 
world through broadcasting access. He be-
came a forerunner in the cable television in-
dustry through Burnside Comex Cable TV, 
writing franchise agreements and expanding 
access in our small communities. Thanks to 
his foresight and diligence, he literally crossed 
bridges for the first time, bringing cable to the 
city of Burnside and Burnside Marina. Fol-
lowing his success in the cable industry, Roy 
established 
CNl 
Wireless 
to 
focus 
on 
broadband connectivity in our rural region. 
I frequently sought Roy’s advice over the 
years and counted him as a trusted confidant 
and advisor. We sorted out a number of chal-
lenges and strategies together over lunch or a 
round of golf, because he believed in making 
the most out of every day; work was the main 
topic of conversation for Roy in every situa-
tion. He always stayed busy, focusing his time 
and energy on projects that could create more 
jobs and develop new opportunities for the 
Lake Cumberland region. 
We have made great strides to advance 
technology across southern and eastern Ken-
tucky over the last 40 years, thanks to leaders 
like Roy Taylor, who committed a lifetime of 
work and expertise to help make our rural re-
gion a better place to live. My wife Cynthia 
and l extend our deepest heartfelt sympathies 
to the Taylor family and all those who were 
blessed to know our loyal friend.

sity. She also has used almost all her life ad-
vocating for social justice and equality for all. 
At only 20 years old, Channing has orga-
nized and led protests in public schools in her 
home state of Texas since her adolescence. 
Channing first found her voice in her NAACP 
Youth Council in Arlington, Texas. She now 
leads as the Howard University NAACP Chap-
ter President and the Region 7 National 
Youth-Works Committee Representative. This 
past fall, Channing continued her fight for so-
cial justice when she was one of eight student 
leaders to participate in the #Blackburn Take-
over. 
Now this month, her work is being honored 
at the highest level. On February 26th, she 
proudly received the NAACP Award for Youth 
Activist of the Year. This award recognizes 
NAACP members for their work to improve 
their community, educate the masses, identify 
the problems, and lead the revolution to fix 
them. 
We are so proud of Channing for her work 
and for this accomplishment. We know her 
continued commitment to social justice and 
equity will make our community a better place 
for all.

HONORING BARBARA ROBERTS 
MASON 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Barbara Roberts Mason of Lansing 
as an internationally recognized voice for edu-
cation, equality, and justice. 
This exceptional public servant made Michi-
gan history by becoming the first African 
American woman to be elected to statewide 
office. Serving 24 years on Michigan’s State 
Board of Education, Barbara worked tirelessly 
as a child advocate to push for equal edu-
cational opportunities and high academic 
standards for all. 
In 1986, she founded the Black Child and 
Family Institute in Lansing, which she con-
siders one of her proudest accomplishments. 
She met with President Jimmy Carter on Stra-
tegic Arms Limitation Talks, and was a trail-
blazer for the Equal Rights Amendment cam-
paign alongside legends like Gloria Steinem, 
Dorothy Height, and Mildred Jeffrey. 
Barbara’s advocacy and dedication to the 
service of others has taken her all over the 
globe. She has lectured abroad and led hu-
manitarian, 
business, 
and 
education 
ex-
changes to Japan, Germany, Korea, Ghana, 
Cameroon, and South Africa. During her time 
as the President of Lansing’s Regional Sister 
City Commission, she established an HIV– 
AIDS project in Ghana, as well as the con-
struction and renovation of health clinics, 
schools, libraries, and worked towards clean 
water, sanitation, and hygiene. 
Clearly, Barbara’s humanitarian heart knows 
no bounds. For her outstanding merit and life 
accomplishments in service of her community, 
and the international community, Barbara re-
ceived the honor of being inducted into the 
Michigan Women’s Hall of Fame in 2014. 
When asked to give remarks, Barbara stated 
that she ‘‘strongly believes that if everyone 
would reach out and give help to someone in 
need, we’d all be better off.’’ I agree, and I am 
so thankful for her commendable actions that 
made Michigan a better place. 
For her tireless service to all those in need, 
it is my privilege to add her story so that many 
more will answer her call to service.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SALARY 
TRANSPARENCY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Salary Transparency Act, which 
would require employers to provide the salary 
range for jobs in advertisements and inter-
views and to existing employees. 
Several states have enacted laws relating to 
salary range disclosure, and the federal gov-
ernment should follow their lead and make this 
a nationwide requirement. Salary transparency 
is an important tool to combat the gender and 
race wage gap. Salary secrecy facilitates both 
intentional and unintentional pay discrimination 
and perpetuates the wage gap. 
Studies have consistently shown that when 
women negotiate for their salaries, they nego-
tiate for less than similarly situated men. Fre-
quently, this is because the salary they re-
quest is a certain percentage higher than their 
current salary. Because women on average 
make less than men, this practice perpetuates 
the wage gap. The same is true for people of 
color, who earn less on average than their 
White counterparts. Requiring employers to 
disclose the salary range for a position will 
help eliminate this harmful portion of the nego-
tiation and lead to a reduction in the wage gap 
for women and minorities. 
This is the third pay equity bill I have intro-
duced this Congress. My Pay Equity for All 
Act, which passed the House last year as part 
of the Paycheck Fairness Act, would prohibit 
employers from asking job applicants about 
their salary history, and my Fair Pay Act would 
require that men and women doing com-
parable work be paid comparable wages. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

DUCK BOAT SAFETY 
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2022 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Duck Boat Safety Improvement 
Act of 2022, a bill to implement safety regula-
tions for amphibious passenger vessels, par-
ticularly those known as duck boats. These 
safety recommendations were made by fed-
eral agencies to address persistent problems 
associated with duck boats that have resulted 
in far too many injuries and fatalities. 
I became much more aware of these prob-
lems when my constituents, the Coleman fam-
ily, were involved in a horrible duck boat acci-
dent on July 19, 2018 in Branson, Missouri. 
Tia Coleman was one of only two survivors 
from her family of 11, losing her husband 
Glenn and her children Reece (nine years 
old), Evan (seven years old), and Arya (one 
year old). Tia’s 13–year-old nephew, Donovan 
Coleman, was the other surviving family mem-
ber, losing his mother Angela, his younger 
brother Maxwell (two years old), his uncles 
Ervin (76 years old) and Butch (70 years old), 
and his aunt Belinda (69 years old). Boarding 
a duck boat on Table Rock Lake started out 
as a fun outing for family members, but turned 
into an unspeakable tragedy when the boat 
capsized and sank. Seventeen of the 31 pas-
sengers on board were killed. 
The National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) and U.S. Coast Guard have sepa-
rately investigated the incident and the last 
few aspects of the investigation should be 
completed soon. 
But Congress should not wait to act. We 
know from past incidents that more can be 
done to make these vessels safer. Since 
1999, more than 40 people have died in duck 
boats accidents, the vast majority of them 
from drowning when the vessel sinks. The 
NTSB in 2002 issued recommendations to im-
prove the safety of the vessels in flooding or 
sinking situations but little has been done to 
implement those measures. 
Duck boats are hybrid vehicles that can 
travel on roadways and waterways, so the 
safety measures must be updated for both 
land and waterborne operations. 
The Duck Boat Safety Improvement Act will 
require vessel operators to implement com-
monsense boating safety measures, including: 
Improving reserve buoyancy and watertight 
compartmentalization to prevent sinking, 
Requiring more monitoring and adherence 
to severe weather alerts and warnings, 
Requiring release of road safety seatbelts 
when Duck Boats become waterborne, 
Requiring stronger crew safety training and 
certification, 
Removing or reconfigure canopies and win-
dow coverings for waterborne operations, 
Requiring personal flotation devices for wa-
terborne operations, 
Requiring installation of better bilge pumps 
and alarms, 
Installing underwater LED lights that activate 
automatically in emergencies, and 
Complying with other Coast Guard boating 
safety requirements. 
These basic safety requirements will help 
save lives and prevent future tragedies. I hope 
my colleagues will join me in supporting this 
bill to make commnsense corrections to the 
persistent safety problems facing duck boats 
so that no other family must suffer the kind of 
tragedy faced by my constituents on Table 
Rock Lake. I urge the House to support this 
bill.

HONORING LULU V. CHILDERS 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the incredible contributions to 
musical history and to the history of Howell, 
Michigan made by one of the city’s Black pio-
neers, Lulu Childers. 
This remarkable woman was ultimately re-
sponsible for developing the small music pro-
gram at Howard University in Washington, 
D.C., first into a Conservatory of Music, and 
then into a School of Music. 
But before all that, she was a child in How-
ell, Michigan, the daughter of slaves, her par-
ents brought her from Dry Ridge, Kentucky in 
1875 at the age of five. 
It was in Howell that the public was first 
treated to the gift of Lulu’s voice. In the early 
1880s, she performed regularly at the Howell 
Opera House and its neighboring Methodist 
Church on Walnut Street. By 17 she was sing-
ing at numerous fundraisers and events 
across the area and was billed as ‘‘Howell’s 
Lulu Childers.’’ 
And in 1890, she walked across the stage 
as valedictorian of the Howell High School 
Class, and enrolled at Oberlin Conservatory in 
Ohio to study voice. 
After graduation, Childers performed around 
the country but felt a tug to the classroom. 
She taught music in Ohio public schools for 
several years, and then in 1905, she joined 
the faculty of Howard University. 
At the time, Lulu was one of only two music 
teachers at Howard. She taught voice, and an-
other instructor taught piano. In 1906, Lulu 
was appointed Director of Music and steadily 
the program blossomed. 
Lulu established a college-level curriculum, 
hired experienced instructors, and created the 
University Choral Society. When she led the 
chorus in song, the people turned out. At the 
1929 Christmas service, Lulu drew a crowd so 
large that there was standing room only and 
400 people had to be turned away. 
Lulu also created an annual concert series 
that brought renowned musicians to the Wash-
ington community. In 1938 she invited the 
famed contralto, Marian Anderson, to perform. 
The performance gained national attention be-
cause both the Board of Education of Wash-
ington, D.C. and the Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution refused to let Anderson per-
form in their facilities because of her race. 
Lulu used her voice, not just to sing, but to 
enlist the help of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt 
in the fight for equity and justice. She also 
took her advocacy to Secretary of the Interior 
Harold Ickes, who in turn invited Anderson to 
perform at the Lincoln Memorial, a free con-
cert which drew 75,000 people on Easter Sun-
day of 1939. 
One year later, Lulu retired from Howard 
University and returned to her family home in 
Howell, where she died in 1946. 
It’s so entirely fitting that ten years after her 
passing, the classroom portion of Howard Uni-
versity’s fine arts complex was renamed Lulu 
V. Childers Hall. 
Lulu Childers was born with the gift of voice, 
a gift she never took for granted. She used 
that voice to entertain, to instruct, and to advo-
cate. She sang the anthem of freedom, jus-
tice, and equality with perfect pitch and tone. 
Let us all endeavor to use our own lives and 
our own voices to carry her tune, to continue 
singing her song, and to ensure that the music 
never ends.

to the public on March 1, 1976. Complete with 
an ice rink and a Ford monorail connecting the 
then-named Dearborn Hyatt Regency with the 
Center, at the time Fairlane was the shining 
example of what the modern shopping mall 
could be, right at home in Metro Detroit. 
The businesses of Fairlane Town Center 
have come and gone over the years and hun-
dreds of stores and services have called 
Fairlane home. When they opened in 1976, 
the 
mall 
was 
anchored 
by 
Sears 
and 
JCPenney, later joined by Hudson’s, Lord & 
Taylor, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Now, it is an-
chored by Macy’s and JCPenney—along with 
Ford Motor Company’s innovative Town Cen-
ter Office. Fairlane Town Center is a place 
where businesses thrive and has been a con-
sistent supporter of the local economy, helping 
us all find the goods and services that we 
need—all in one place. 
Fairlane Town Center has served as a 
shopping destination and gathering place for 
residents of Dearborn for the past 45 years. It 
has been where generations of Dearbornites 
have worked and played. Serving as home to 
budding small businesses and landmark de-
partment stores alike, there has always been 
something for everyone at Fairlane Town Cen-
ter. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Fairlane Town Center as they 
celebrate 45 fantastic years of business in 
Dearborn, Michigan. As the times have 
changed, so has Fairlane in order to meet the 
needs of our consumers. As a fixture of our 
community for the last four decades, we wish 
them the very best in the years to come.

RECOGNIZING 
PUERTO 
RICO 
YOUTH AT RISK, INC.’S 25 YEARS 
OF SERVICE AND ITS FOUNDER, 
DR. MERCEDES CINTRO´ N 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I want to recognize the work of Puerto Rico 
Youth at Risk, Inc.—Jo´venes de Puerto Rico 
en Riesgo, Inc., in Spanish—on its 25 years of 
service. I also want to congratulate the organi-
zation’s founder, Dr. Mercedes Cintro´n, who 
was recently selected as a finalist for the Life-
time Achievement Award during the National 
Mentoring Summit’s 2022 Excellence in Men-
toring Award Ceremony. 
Puerto Rico Youth at Risk is a non-profit or-
ganization focused on developing school drop-
out and delinquency prevention programs for 
at-risk youth in Puerto Rico. Since 1996, they 
have carried out multiple initiatives to help at- 
risk students on the Island achieve their full 
potential, including through one-on-one men-
toring services, personal and social develop-
ment workshops, academic support, and com-
munity service experiences. Puerto Rico Youth 
at Risk has been highly successful, as 98 per-
cent of students who participate in its various 
programs remain at school; 95 percent grad-
uate from high school; and 70 percent of the 
program’s graduates have gone on to pursue 
higher education studies. 
On January 28, 2022, Dr. Mercedes Cintro´n 
was nominated and selected as a finalist for 
the 2022 Excellence in Mentoring Award Cere-
mony’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which 
recognizes individuals who have dedicated 
their life’s work to supporting youth through 
mentoring. Dr. Cintro´n is a psychologist and 
social worker who has dedicated the last 28 
years of her career and volunteer work to pro-
mote and facilitate the use of ontological men-
toring to prevent school dropout and antisocial 
behavior in teens. She has witnessed over 
3,000 successful mentoring experiences that 
have changed the lives of both mentors and 
mentees, many of whom have continued to 
serve in their communities. 
In 1993, Dr. Cintro´n pioneered the use of 
formal mentoring in Puerto Rico. She was in-
spired and committed to establishing Puerto 
Rico Youth at Risk after completing her term 
as Administrator of Puerto Rico’s Juvenile 
Correctional Institutions, where she saw first-
hand the need to carry out evidenced-based 
prevention and intervention programs to reach 
at-risk young individuals before it is too late. 
Dr. Cintro´n’s selection as a finalist for the 
Excellence in Mentoring Award Ceremony’s 
Lifetime Achievement Award is a testament to 
Puerto Rico Youth at Risk’s impact and valu-
able work during the past 25 years. It also 
represents a historic milestone, as Dr. Cintro´n 
was the only Puerto Rican among this year’s 
nominees and the first individual from Puerto 
Rico to have been nominated for this pres-
tigious award. 
I’m honored to join Puerto Rico Youth at 
Risk to celebrate Dr. Cintro´n’s achievement 
and the organization’s 25 years of service on 
behalf of Puerto Rico’s at-risk and vulnerable 
students.

HONORING OLYMPIAN JAKE 
VEDDER 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Jake Vedder, a young man of excep-
tional character and talent who valiantly rep-
resented his home town of Pinckney, Michigan 
and Team USA at the 2022 Winter Olympics 
in Beijing, China. 
At the Olympics, Vedder finished sixth out of 
32 competitors in the individual snowboard 
race, and was first among the four Americans 
competing. This 23-year-old phenom was also 
named to one of the two United States 
tandems 
for 
the 
inaugural 
mixed 
team 
snowboard cross event, where he and his 
partner made it to the quarterfinals. 
Unlike many snowboarders, Jake wasn’t 
born in the mountains and didn’t grow up in a 
resort town. He’s from Pinckney, population 
2300, and he began his snowsports career at 
the age of two on the small but beloved ski 
hills in the neighboring town that were made 
with leftover material from the construction of 
the interstate. 
He was a kid with a dream, a family that 
supported it, and a community that nurtured it. 
And as his star has risen, from winning the 
state championship as a 10th grader, to win-
ning a gold medal in the Youth Olympics at 
age 18, to competing on the world’s biggest 
athletic stage at age 23, he’s never forgotten 
where he comes from. 
Jake is known for spending whatever free 
time he has dishing out encouragement to 
younger athletes, giving tips on techniques, 
handing out gear, and just being present to 
offer support. In fact, just hours after returning 
home from the Olympics, Jake was back at 
Mt. Brighton where it all began for him, cheer-
ing on high school snowboarders who were 
competing in the state meet. 
No matter how high he jumps, how fast he 
races, or how far he travels, Jake clearly re-
mains grounded. He is tethered by his home-
town values, anchored by humility, and rooted 
in kindness. In an era where so many seek in-
stant celebrity or viral fame, Jake’s modest 
spirit and good nature are almost as impres-
sive as his athletic accomplishments. 
On and off the slopes, he is a leader and a 
role model who has made Pinckney so proud. 
I have no doubt that whatever the future holds 
for him, he will conquer it with the tenacity, 
discipline, and humanity that have already 
taken him so far. It is my great honor to in-
scribe his accomplishments in the United 
States House of Representatives.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
MAXWELL HUNTLEY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Maxwell (Max) Huntley 
and his service to Virginia’s First District and 
the Nation. 
Max earned his bachelor’s degree in English 
and master’s degree in Public Policy from the 
University of Michigan. He is currently pur-
suing a master’s degree in Military Operations 
from the United States Air Force Air Com-
mand and Staff College. As a NCAA All-Amer-
ican athlete, Max dominated the mats as the 
University of Michigan’s first three-time wres-
tling team captain in the school’s history. 
Max joined my office in April 2017 and be-
came my Military Legislative Assistant in Feb-
ruary 2019 and Senior Advisor in May 2021. 
During his time serving Virginia’s First District, 
Max admirably staffed my House Armed Serv-
ices Committee, including my role as Sea 
power and Projection Forces Subcommittee 
Chairman and Ranking Member. Max labored 
tirelessly to advance the shared goal of a larg-
er and more capable United States Navy and 
Marine Corps in an era of Great Power Com-
petition. 
Max has devoted his talents to the common 
good and the nation’s defense as he follows 
the distinguished Huntley family tradition of 
service to the United States. I would like to 
thank Max for his contributions over the last 4 
years. l wish Max the best as he continues his 
journey on the other side of the Capitol with 
Senator John Kennedy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing Max Huntley for his dedicated 
service to Virginia’s First District. May God 
bless Max as he continues his career in public 
service.

REMEMBERING LORETTA SHAW 
HARRISON 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the late Loretta Shaw 
Harrison. 
Loretta S. Harrison was born in Verret, Lou-
isiana, on February 1, 1956, the seventh child 
of twelve born to the late George W. Shaw, 
Sr. and Loretta Louise Moore Shaw. She 
passed away peacefully around family and 
friends on February 16, 2022, at the age of 
66, after a brave battle with breast cancer. 
She is survived by three sons she adored, 
Robert, Roddrick, and Kendrick; two grand-
children; two godchildren; eight of her siblings; 
and many nephews, nieces, and friends. 
Loretta was a faithful steward of God with 
the belief that if you ‘‘put God first, He will 
grant the wishes of your heart.’’ She shared 
her unwavering love and dedication for God 
and the city of New Orleans with everyone 
she encountered. She was a woman with in-
credible grace and moral fortitude and was a 
guiding light to her friends and community. 
Loretta, lovingly referred to as the ‘‘Praline 
Queen,’’ was the chef and owner of the his-
toric Loretta’s Authentic Pralines, becoming 
the first African American woman to own and 
operate a praline company in New Orleans. 
She made friends and admirers worldwide 
through her shop and her long-standing record 
as a food vendor at the city’s biggest festivals, 
starting with the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage 
Festival. Her mother made pralines after 
church for family and guests visiting their 
home. By age 8, Loretta was cooking them 
alongside her mom, using a recipe that went 
back to her great grandmother. After grad-
uating from Southern University at New Orle-
ans, she went to work at the LSU Medical Li-
brary, where she sold pralines to students on 
the side. In 1978, her big break came when 
she heard that the Jazz & Heritage Festival 
put out the call for a praline vendor. She won 
the contract, sold 1,500 pralines in two week-
ends, and continued to supply the festival for 
over 40 years. The success inspired her to 
leave her job and develop her business full 
time. 
Unfortunately, success did not come without 
a few failures along the way. Yet, she believed 
in her product and herself. By 1983, she 
opened her first shop in Jax Brewery. Later, 
she moved to the French Market, and in the 
1990s, by the grace of God, she opened a 
second, much larger shop and production 
kitchen in Faubourg Marigny that serves 
gumbo, seafood platters, stuffed peppers, and 
calas, as well as pie, cookies, and king cake. 
She was a proud entrepreneur who advocated 
for local business owners, cultural and culinary 
arts. 
After Hurricane Katrina, she quickly returned 
to New Orleans and was a vocal advocate for 
small businesses in meetings with national 
and local officials. During this difficult time, her 
business was buoyed by her steadfast belief 
that anything which can be destroyed can be 
rebuilt. She took immediate action, changing 
her business model to include an online store-
front and becoming a restaurant for reporters, 
emergency workers, and volunteers rebuilding 
the city. She added plate lunches and dishes 
like gumbo, figuring people needed a place to 
grab a meal more than sweets. She would 
continue to evolve her menu and creations. 
She added praline filling to traditional beignets 
and even made beignets into sandwiches filled 
with crab cakes, eggs and bacon, and ham-
burger patties. 
A veritable Renaissance Woman, she was a 
faithful member of Franklin Avenue Baptist 
Church. She was a wonder to all who knew 
and loved her, and she will be remembered 
fondly for her joyful spirit and relentless opti-
mism, which served her well until God called 
her home. Through her heroic battle with can-
cer, Loretta has helped shower numerous 
heavenly graces and blessings upon all of 
those she loved so deeply, and we are eter-
nally grateful. I was honored and blessed to 
have known Loretta Harrison, and send my 
prayers to her beloved family in this difficult 
time.

HONORING WILLARD WALKER 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. Willard Walker, a civil rights era 
leader, devoted public servant, youth football 
coach, MSU alumnus, and friend to the Great-
er Lansing community. For more than 50 
years, Mr. Walker has fought tirelessly for so-
cial justice, and the community is so much 
better for his efforts. 
Raised in Columbus, Georgia, by his grand-
mother, he joined the military after graduating 
from Albany State University. 
His first job out of the military was as a 
math teacher in Chicago. There, he fought to 
unite historically segregated schools. Willard 
met and married his first wife in Chicago, with 
whom he had two children. They eventually 
moved to Alabama, where Mr. Walker began 
work for the Birmingham Urban League, be-
fore arriving at Michigan State University in 
1969, where he was the first Black student in 
the industrial relations department. He lived in 
Case Hall, a place he described as the epi-
center for black student life. 
Mr. Walker has been influential in both local 
and state government, serving under four City 
of Lansing Mayors in various roles, including 
director of the Human Resources and Com-
munity Services Department, and on the Lan-
sing Police Commission. At the state level he 
served as director of Michigan’s School-to- 
Work Office, director of the Michigan Depart-
ment of Commerce, and deputy director of the 
Neighborhood Builders Alliance—just to name 
a few. 
But beyond his many impressive titles, his 
work to ensure the Greater Lansing area is a 
more equitable and welcoming place is leg-
endary. As a founding member of the Greater 
Lansing Area, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Holi-
day Commission, he was the first recipient of 
the Commission’s MLK Legacy Award in 2010. 
In 2018, the City of Lansing Parks and 
Recreation Department dedicated the former 
youth sports facility, Ridsdale Park, in his 
honor, and it is now known as the Willard 
Walker stadium at Ridsdale Park. It gives me 
great happiness to know that through these 
awards and honors, his legacy of service will 
continue to provide a positive impact in the 
Greater Lansing community for generations to 
come. 
Mr. Walker is married to his current wife 
Victoria where they have been residents of 
Lansing’s historic Westside for over five dec-
ades. Two years ago, he returned to local 
government to serve the City of Lansing as a 
consultant in Human Relations and Commu-
nity Service, a department he ran for over a 
decade. 
It’s an honor to represent a community lead-
er like Mr. Willard Walker in Washington, and 
I am grateful for his personal and professional 
sacrifices to advance civil rights at the local, 
state, and national levels. May his efforts be 
forever celebrated, uplifted, and immortalized.

IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD JEN-
KINS’ 
OUTSTANDING 
MILITARY 
SERVICE 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize World War Two veteran 
Richard Jenkins for his incredible role in liber-
ating Czechoslovakia in May 1945. Today the 
Czech Republic will present him with an Hon-
orary Commemorative Medal of Merit in Liber-
ating Czechoslovakia during World War Two. 
Shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Mr. 
Jenkins and his brothers enlisted in the United 
States Military, leaving their home in Michigan. 
After training in Louisiana, Mr. Jenkins was 
assigned to be a member of the 8th Armored 
Division, 130th Ordnance Maintenance Bat-
talion of the United States Army. He was then 
deployed to England in January 1945 for fur-
ther training. After reaching Europe, the 8th 
Armored Division attempted to quickly push 
through the Hurtgen Forest on the border of 
Belgium and Germany. Mr. Jenkins provided 
crucial support to ensure the United States’ 
success in the Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Jenkins 
and his ordnance provided the support needed 
by the 8th Armored Division as they success-
fully pushed back the German Army. Refueling 
and mechanical assistance were some of Mr. 
Jenkins’ many roles in the 130th Ordnance, 
without this support the 8th Division may not 
have been able to traverse the thick Hurtgen 
forest. After success at the Battle of the Bulge, 
the 8th Armored Division transitioned toward 
Czechoslovakia. On May 8, 1945, Nazi Ger-
many surrendered to the Allies, bringing an 
end to World War Two in the European The-
ater. Then, in late May, the 8th Armored Divi-
sion was ordered to Czechoslovakia to assist 
in the processing of prisoners of war, oper-
ating displaced person camps, and guarding 
vital installations. The assistance of Mr. Jen-
kins and the 8th Armored Division was integral 
to the liberation of Czechoslovakia. The suc-
cessful liberation of Czechoslovakia as a re-
sult of the impressive effort of U.S. troops and 
the citizens of Pilsen is still celebrated today. 
The Pilsen Festival in The Czech Republic 
celebrates the key assistance the United 
States and our troops played in liberating the 
country from Nazi rule. Without heroes like Mr. 
Jenkins, we may not be able to celebrate 
these freedoms.

February 25, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I once again thank Rich-
ard Jenkins for his service to the United 
States and the assistance he provided in the 
Liberation of Czechoslovakia. Northeast Wis-
consin can be proud that a hero like Mr. Jen-
kins is being honored by the Czech Republic 
for his service and sacrifice. I urge all col-
leagues to join me in recognizing these out-
standing men and women.

LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THE 
RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 25, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, we are living 
through a major international event. My posi-
tion on the Russia-Ukraine conflict has not 
changed, this is not our war and American 
forces need not be involved. Yet, Americans 
are still feeling the impact of this conflict, re-
minding us how dangerous our current policies 
of foreign reliance are in an international sys-
tem inhabited with rogue regimes vying to be 
great powers. 
Over the course of several decades, 
through two hot wars, and one cold war, the 
U.S. went abroad to defeat forces of evil and 
tyranny threatening America and the freedom 
loving world. After leaving the international 
system based on the rule of law, democracy, 
and human rights, America came home but its 
officials remained abroad placing international 
affairs above American security, economic de-
velopment abroad over economic prosperity at 
home, and foreign supply chains over Amer-
ican ones. 
In 2016, the American people through a col-
lective voice announced its intention to return 
to our own domestic affairs, as the Founders 
intended, to disentangle from the system 
where foreign treaties and global corporations 
set our policy instead of the American people 
through their representatives. In short, to enjoy 
the security and liberty we had obtained for 
ourselves. But Mr. Biden has instead reverted 
to the old status quo. 
Ukraine is over 6,000 miles from my state of 
Arizona, yet my constituents are still feeling 
the consequences of bad policy and poor gov-
ernance. The Biden Administration’s decision 
making since the beginning has led to this 
conflict, signaling to foreign powers that such 
aggressive behavior is acceptable and inter-
twining the daily security and prosperity of the 
American people to actions of foreign adver-
saries, undermining their liberty as citizens of 
a secure power. 
Mr. Biden from the first day tied the energy 
security of the American people to foreign re-
gimes in the name of politics. To appease rad-
ical climate change activists, Mr. Biden can-
celled the Keystone pipeline and crushed oil 
and gas permitting on federal lands. With do-
mestic demand not changing, we went from 
energy independent and a net exporter to pur-
chasing 600,000 barrels per day from Russia 
which has some of the worst emitting pipelines 
in the world. These oil and gas profits grant it 
geopolitical leverage over America and its al-
lies and fuels the Russian war machine now 
attacking another nation. 
U.S. imports of Russian goods since the 
Obama Administration are up over 22 percent. 
$13 billion annually in mineral fuels, $1.4 bil-
lion in iron and steel, nearly a billion in fer-
tilizers, and the list goes on. A trade deficit of 
over $13 billion with Russia who is attacking 
a neighboring state. With Russian economic 
production slowed due to conflict and the pos-
sibility that it could retaliate against sanctions, 
Russia can cut the U.S. and its allies off from 
products we critically need. 
The damage reflected from foreign reliance 
does not end here, nor does Mr. Biden’s in-
volvement as the source of the pain. The U.S. 
is reliant on foreign adversaries for critical 
minerals needed to sustain our national de-
fense, provide health care for our citizens, and 
more. Russia is particularly influential over 
American access to helium and uranium, with 
another foreign adversary, China, controlling 
other can’t live without minerals. Yet Mr. Biden 
and this majority has killed mining projects 
across America, including copper and uranium 
mines in Arizona. Now our source of these 
materials is at war with another country and 
can turn off the flow of these materials to 
America based on how this conflict plays out. 
And let’s talk about NATO, the trigger point 
for this conflict. President Trump cogently 
noted that NATO members were in violation of 
their contractual obligation to fund their military 
forces at 2.5 percent of their GDP. But they 
have been in breach of this agreement for 
decades. It is so bad that the German war 
minister reported that Germany had no military 
assets to contribute at this time. 
Commentator Mark America explains it well: 
‘‘Trump was not only right about European na-
tions’ contributions to NATO, but their under-
lying defense expenditures are cratering. 
Since Trump left, they’ve fallen off a cliff, with 
reports that the German Army couldn’t deploy 
sufficient forces to repeal successfully much of 
anything. In short, Europe has left themselves 
virtually defenseless, with the brief exception 
of the period of Trump’s presidency, with only 
new NATO member Poland substantially up-
holding the promise of expending at least two 
percent of their national GDP on defense. The 
United States has been bearing the burdens 
of defending Europe for most of a century 
now, yet we cannot get them to pay to defend 
themselves, and there is no will under the cur-
rent administration in Washington, DC to hold 
NATO’s feet to the fire. In 2020, Germany 
barely attained 1.57 percent of its GDP in de-
fense spending, and that was after extensive 
prodding from President Trump. When he took 
office, the Germans were spending roughly 
1.1 percent on defense. In short, don’t look to 
Berlin for help.’’ 
So when my constituents ask me why does 
a conflict 6,000 miles from our border increase 
prices on Americans at the pump, dent their 
401ks, and raise the cost of everyday goods, 
the answer is because Mr. Biden consistently 
makes decisions which put Americans last. 
Rather than continuing the reorientation of 
governance towards American prosperity and 
security which started in 2016, Mr. Biden has 
turned back outward. But Americans are real-
izing who stands for and against them. On 
January 20, 2017, President Trump echoed 
the will of the American people when he said 
‘‘from this day forward, it’s only going to be 
America First . . . every decision on trade, on 
taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be 
made to benefit American workers and Amer-
ican families.’’ The last year, culminating in a 
foreign conflict we are not fighting hurting our 
country, shows the folly of straying from such 
a simple proclamation, and we must return to 
a government for the People.
