RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, President Biden addressed the 
country about the ongoing crisis that 
Russia has created on its border with 
Ukraine. 
There was much in the President’s 
remarks that I appreciated. He was 
right to candidly remind the Russian 
people that neither the United States 
nor NATO nor Ukraine wants a war. He 
was right to emphasize that the world 
will not shrug or stand idly by if Vladi-
mir Putin tries to invade his neighbor 
or redraw the map of Europe through 
deadly force. 
We have spent much time discussing 
Russia’s alleged security concerns and 
not enough time examining the legiti-
mate concerns of Russia’s neighbors, 
many of whom have a long history—a 
long history—of being invaded by Mos-
cow. The concerns of these free, sov-
ereign states matter as well, and the 
President would do well to amplify 
their voices and their historical experi-
ences. 
So it is fine for President Biden to 
engage in good-faith diplomacy, pro-
vided we are skeptical about Putin’s 
intentions. Thus far, Putin’s behavior 
is proving how little he can be trusted 
and how little he is interested in diplo-
macy as anything other than a gambit 
to divide the West or a pretext for war. 
The United States must keep sending 
these strong messages, verbally and 
with concrete actions, both right now 
before any hostilities and then with

devastating force if Putin does, indeed, 
plow ahead. 
The United States and our partners 
should 
waste 
no 
time 
in 
helping 
Ukraine prepare for war—weapons, ma-
teriel, advice, logistics, and intel-
ligence. We should be building the in-
frastructure to help Ukraine sustain 
their resistance to Russian aggression 
if and when it comes. 
I welcome the President’s deploy-
ment of additional forces to the terri-
tory of NATO allies situated along our 
alliance’s 
eastern 
flank. 
I 
rec-
ommended he take such action months 
ago. And I am particularly grateful to 
the Kentuckians of the 101st Airborne 
Division who are leaving Fort Camp-
bell this week to join NATO reinforce-
ments in Eastern Europe. 
As our diplomats work to halt the 
train of Russian aggression, it is the 
brave men and women of the U.S. mili-
tary 
who 
give 
their 
words 
added 
weight. 
I am hopeful that President Biden 
will rise to the occasion. As a bipar-
tisan group of colleagues and I made 
clear in a joint statement yesterday, 
the 
President 
would 
have 
over-
whelming, bipartisan support to use his 
existing 
Executive 
authorities 
for 
tough sanctions against Russia in the 
event of conflict. 
We should acknowledge Putin’s use 
of energy as a weapon. If the President 
is serious about providing relief for 
Americans at the pump or blunting 
Putin’s manipulation of energy mar-
kets, he will stop his administration’s 
anti-energy policies that make it hard-
er for our own producers to explore, to 
produce, and to export energy to vul-
nerable allies. 
While our eastern flank allies have 
consistently taken a clear-eyed ap-
proach to their own defense, it is time 
for America to invest more meaning-
fully in our own military capabilities 
and demand that our allies in Western 
Europe actually follow suit. 
Whether the administration is seri-
ous about competition with Russia and 
China will be clear when it submits its 
fiscal 2023 budget request. Our allies 
and adversaries will all be watching. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. President, now on a different 
matter, while the world’s eyes are fixed 
on the present foreign policy crisis, 
troubling facts are continuing to sur-
face surrounding the administration’s 
previous 
self-inflicted 
crisis—the 
botched retreat from Afghanistan. 
Last week, journalists published the 
findings of a 2,000-page autopsy that 
Army officials compiled following the 
chaotic withdrawal from Kabul. The re-
port hammers home a damning fact we 
have 
actually 
already 
known 
for 
months: The Biden administration re-
ceived clear advance warnings from 
commanders on the ground that should 
have been heeded but went ignored. As 
I warned at the time, we have con-
firmation this disaster was foresee-
able—foreseen, 
actually—and 
avoid-
able. 
The Army’s conclusions build upon 
the report from the Special Inspector 
General which was declassified last 
month. 
While President Biden and his polit-
ical advisers still cling to the notion 
that they got mistaken advice and 
were caught off-guard, both these re-
ports suggest that nonpartisan experts 
knew and predicted the Afghan mili-
tary would likely collapse and spent 
months trying in vain to get the ad-
ministration to pay attention. 
Top commanders reported that try-
ing to get State Department officials 
to engage in advance evacuation plans 
was like ‘‘pulling teeth’’; that the Na-
tional Security Council was ‘‘not seri-
ously planning for an evacuation’’; 
that among peers in uniform, ‘‘every-
one clearly saw some of the advantage 
of holding Bagram.’’ 
As the top U.S. commander on the 
ground during the evacuation put it, 
policymakers had not ‘‘paid attention 
to the indicators of what was hap-
pening on the ground.’’ 
This staggering report from our own 
U.S. Army should have chastened the 
Biden administration. It should be an 
occasion for apology, reflection, and 
accountability. But last week, Presi-
dent Biden instead tried to simply 
wave away our own Army’s conclusions 
without evidence. 
He was asked, ‘‘Are you rejecting the 
conclusions or the accounts in this 
[Army] report?’’ 
The President replied, ‘‘Yes, I am.’’ 
‘‘So, they’re not true?’’ 
‘‘I’m rejecting them,’’ the President 
said. 
No evidence; just hand-waving denial. 
Frankly, it was a bizarre performance. 
Our retreat from Afghanistan seri-
ously damaged America’s credibility. 
It made confronting terrorist threats 
that much harder from over the hori-
zon, and it invited more testing like 
what we are now enduring in Eastern 
Europe. 
President Biden and his team were 
warned of all these dangers well in ad-
vance by our own military, but our 
Commander in Chief seems to have 
flat-out ignored our commanders. This 
has been an unbelievably costly lesson 
that the Biden administration should 
never have had to learn even once. Let 
us all hope they don’t need to learn it 
twice. 
LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS 
Mr. President, now on one final mat-
ter, parents and kids need a swift end 
to pandemic disruptions that ignore 
the incredibly low risk to children. 
I am proudly joining Senator THUNE 
and many of our Republican colleagues 
on a resolution that would overturn 
the absurd preschool mask mandates 
which the Biden administration has 
tied to Head Start funding. 
More than 1,200 doctors and health 
professionals have signed a public 
statement about ‘‘the Urgency of Nor-
mal’’—‘‘the Urgency of Normal’’—the 
medical and moral urgency of return-
ing normalcy back to children as fast 
as possible. Republicans at the local, 
State, and Federal level are standing 
with the parents. We are going to keep 
fighting against these disruptions to 
family life caused by rules and man-
dates that are not at all based in 
science. Two years of needless school 
closures and unscientific, forced child- 
masking are 2 years too many. 
But, unfortunately, pandemic poli-
cies are not the only reason that recent 
years have been one giant advertise-
ment for school choice and parents’ 
rights. We have also seen far-left bu-
reaucrats trying desperately to inject 
radical theories and fringe ideas into 
teacher trainings and K–12 classrooms. 
Everybody has heard draw-dropping 
anecdotes from school districts all 
across our country. Last year, the 
Biden administration tried to divert 
money for mainstream civics education 
into woke propaganda like the de-
bunked 1619 Project. They only backed 
down when Senate Republicans called 
out Secretary Cardona directly. Mean-
while, the far-left national teachers 
union adopted an official resolution 
and approved extra money for their 
fight to make ‘‘structural racism’’ and 
‘‘critical race theory’’ into central te-
nets in kids’ schooling. 
This nonsense is absolutely perva-
sive—pervasive. 
Just a few weeks ago, North Carolina 
parents had to call out their statewide 
Office of Early Learning for funding 
training materials that talked about 
‘‘deconstruct[ing] 
whiteness’’— 
‘‘deconstruct[ing] 
whiteness.’’ 
These 
materials were for preschool teachers. 
In San Francisco, the school board 
spent 2021 focused on renaming schools 
instead of reopening schools. They de-
cided ‘‘George Washington’’ and ‘‘Abra-
ham Lincoln’’ were insufficiently woke 
namesakes, and they tried to change a 
prestigious high school’s merit-based 
standards into a non-merit-based lot-
tery in the name of equity. 
Not surprisingly, parents are watch-
ing 
this 
nonsense 
and 
demanding 
change. For example, just yesterday, a 
multiethnic multilingual recall cam-
paign to unseat three of those San 
Francisco school board members won 
an overwhelming victory with the vot-
ers. 
American parents are speaking out, 
but instead of listening to them, the 
political left is lashing out. 
President Biden’s Education Sec-
retary solicited an outside group to 
send a letter to President Biden’s At-
torney General that referred to con-
cerned parents as potential domestic 
terrorists. 
One part of the Biden administration 
set up another part of the Biden admin-
istration with a pretext to investigate 
and harass concerned parents. 
One far-left advocate recently com-
plained to NPR that ‘‘school trans-
parency is essentially this big brother- 
type regime.’’ What a joke. 
The nationwide teachers union boss, 
Randi Weingarten, personally tweeted 
out a claim that ‘‘racists . . . are show-
ing up in droves to school board meet-
ings.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S727 
February 16, 2022 
Even the liberal ACLU, which used to 
care about individual rights and trans-
parency, is prioritizing woke bureau-
crats ahead of middle-class parents. 
Here was the ACLU’s statement: 
Curriculum transparency bills are just 
thinly veiled attempts at chilling teachers 
and students from learning and talking 
about race and gender in schools. 
So let’s think about that for a 
minute. The far left is admitting in 
public that if the public gets to look at 
the racial and gender theories that 
they want to teach little kids, then 
those lesson plans will become unten-
able. 
I am going to say that again. The far 
left is admitting in public that if the 
public gets a look at the racial and 
gender theories that they want to 
teach little kids, then these lesson 
plans will become untenable. 
That is what they are actually say-
ing. If parents gain transparency into 
the crazy stuff we are teaching, we 
might have to stop teaching it. 
In other words, their reaction proves 
the point. The fact that woke bureau-
crats are this terrified by transparency 
proves exactly—exactly—why parents 
deserve it. 
Bear in mind, these same people are 
passionate supporters of a sweeping 
toddler takeover that would give Fed-
eral bureaucrats huge new powers to 
shape early childhood across America 
and 
discriminate 
against 
religious 
daycares. 
The choice before American families 
is actually pretty stark. On the one 
hand, an alliance between Big Labor, 
woke bureaucrats, and many elected 
Democrats apparently wants indefi-
nitely masked children being taught 
radical nonsense while parents are 
pushed to the sidelines. But Repub-
licans at the local, State, and national 
levels are standing up for science, for 
common sense, and for the children’s 
best interests. The party of parents has 
your back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over 
the last 12 months, the economy has 
rebounded at levels that we have not 
seen in decades—a 5.7-percent GDP 
growth rate and 6.6 million new jobs. 
This is the fastest our economy has 
grown since, perhaps, 1984, and the new 
jobs we added to the economy were the 
most ever for a President’s first year. 
After 
former 
President 
Trump 
botched 
our 
national 
response 
to 
COVID, America is now on the right 
track under President Biden, but we 
face serious challenges that demand 
action from Congress. The cost of liv-
ing has come up for families across the 
country and around the world. The de-
struction unleashed by COVID has 
decimated supply chains, strained the 
labor supply, and the effects of a global 
pandemic that began 2 years ago still 
reverberate today. These challenges de-
mand action, and Democrats remain 
laser-focused on lowering costs for 
American families. 
Yesterday, our caucus met for our 
weekly lunch, where we held a spirited, 
enthusiastic discussion about ideas 
from our Members of how we can lower 
costs and take action to do so. We 
talked about how we can continue 
working to lower childcare costs, pre-
scription drug costs, the costs of semi-
conductors, which is a huge driver of 
price increases across a wide variety of 
products, and things as basic and vital 
as the cost of food and meat. 
Lowering costs will continue to be a 
caucuswide effort. We are not going to 
agree on everything, but we are all on 
the same page in that we need to tack-
le the issue head on. 
That is the difference between Demo-
crats and Republicans. Rising costs, of 
course, impact all of us, whether we 
come from blue or red States, but 
Democrats are the ones laser-focused 
on showing where we stand and in of-
fering solutions that aim squarely at 
the problem. Republicans seem to have 
no solutions, just rhetoric. The other 
side, sadly, seems, oftentimes, moti-
vated by something else. Rather than 
working with us in a bipartisan spirit, 
our Republican colleagues seem more 
comfortable giving speeches that go on 
and on about rising costs without offer-
ing any solutions. Complaining about 
the problem doesn’t make inflation 
better—proposing solutions does—and 
that is precisely what Democrats will 
continue focusing on. 
Over the next month and beyond, 
Members from our side will continue 
offering a number of solutions—solu-
tions—that will lower costs and leave 
more money in people’s pockets. We 
need to help working families build 
wealth after the pandemic. We need to 
lower the costs of medications like in-
sulin, which can still reach $600 a 
month. We need to relieve our strained 
supply chains and increase domestic 
manufacturing on things like chips— 
and on that front, I am hopeful that we 
can take bipartisan action soon. 
Our Republican colleagues, we hope, 
will join us in these efforts. Our Mem-
bers would welcome it. 
We have come a long way from the 
start of COVID, but we still have more 
to do. Democrats’ goals are to make 
sure that the job creation and wage in-
creases of last year carry into this 
year. We are going to keep working on 
that this spring, and I hope to see our 
colleagues from the other side work 
with us to improve the lives of the 
American people. If we can keep wages 
growing and get costs down, the aver-
age American will have more money in 
his or her pocket to live a better life. 
FURTHER ADDITIONAL EXTENDING GOVERNMENT 
FUNDING ACT 
Mr. President, on the CR, soon our 
Republican colleagues must come to an 
agreement with Democrats for passing 
a continuing resolution to keep the 
government open until March 11. This 
extension is necessary in order to give 
appropriators more time to arrive at 
an omnibus. 
On the one hand, bipartisan negotia-
tions on a yearlong spending bill con-
tinue to go well—a credit to everyone 
working on this issue from both sides 
of the aisle. I thank Chairman LEAHY, 
Ranking Member SHELBY, and my 
House colleagues. 
On the other hand, right now, the 
thing we must do—the responsible 
thing to do—is to pass the CR before 
the deadline on Friday. Democrats are 
united in approving it just as it was ap-
proved with great bipartisan support in 
the House. 
Nobody here wants a Republican gov-
ernment shutdown. I dare say Repub-
licans prefer not to have a Republican 
shutdown, but for that to happen, Re-
publicans must keep working with us 
on an agreement to move quickly on a 
CR. Democrats are working in good 
faith to reach a time agreement soon 
with our Republican colleagues. There 
is every reason in the world to arrive 
at an agreement quickly, so I urge my 
colleagues on the other side to keep 
working with us to get there. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, on nominations, later 
today, the Senate is scheduled to ad-
vance and confirm a pair of critical De-
partment of Defense nominees. 
One of them is Celeste Wallander, 
nominated to serve as Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense for International Se-
curity Affairs. A veteran of the Na-
tional Security Council, Ms. Wallander 
is one of our country’s top Russian ex-
perts and a deeply experienced foreign 
policy adviser. 
As tensions persist in Eastern Eu-
rope, Ms. Wallander’s expertise is ur-
gently needed, and her nomination 
must be approved as soon as possible. 
Frankly, 
it 
should 
have 
happened 
weeks ago, the moment she was re-
ported out of committee with support 
from both sides, but Ms. Wallander has 
remained on hold because one Member 
of this body—just one Republican—has 
objected to her swift passage. 
Intentionally delaying the confirma-
tion of a qualified expert on Russian af-
fairs at a time like this is supremely 
reckless and is making the American 
people less safe. For a Member of the 
Senate to insist on this hold is a clear 
risk to our national security, and it 
only serves to undermine our defense 
efforts. It is unacceptable and the defi-
nition of ‘‘cynical.’’ 
Let me say it again. 
To intentionally delay the confirma-
tion of a critical Department of De-
fense nominee and a Russian expert at 
a 
time 
when 
tensions 
persist 
in 
Ukraine and Eastern Europe is su-
premely reckless and is making the 
American people less safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S728 
February 16, 2022 
But while this nominee has been de-
layed, she will nonetheless be con-
firmed by this Chamber. The vast ma-
jority of Senators understand that cer-
tain nominees are out of bounds from 
typical partisan politics. So we are 
going to do our jobs and confirm this 
nominee. As long as Republican holds 
continue on a vast number of other im-
portant nominations, the Senate will 
keep voting as long as it takes to get 
them through the Chamber. If it means 
voting late, as we have done in recent 
weeks, then that is what we must do. 
I will return later to join with my 
colleagues to speak further on increas-
ingly reckless holds—holds that dam-
age our security, both domestic and na-
tional—that we are seeing on the other 
side. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are 
currently in the midst of the worst bor-
der crisis in our Nation’s history. 
It is no exaggeration to say that the 
situation at our southern border is out 
of control. In December, U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection apprehended 
more than 178,000 individuals attempt-
ing to cross our southern border ille-
gally—178,000 in 1 month—which is 
more than double the number of indi-
viduals apprehended by the Border Pa-
trol the previous December. 
This is no isolated incident. Almost 
from the day the President took office, 
our Nation has been experiencing an 
unprecedented border surge. In fiscal 
year 2021, the Border Patrol encoun-
tered more than 1.7 million individuals 
attempting to cross our southern bor-
der—the highest number ever recorded. 
The situation at our southern border 
is a security, enforcement, and human-
itarian nightmare. Our Border Patrol 
officers have done heroic work this 
past year, but they are stretched in-
credibly thin and are having to spend 
too much time caring for migrants and 
not enough time patrolling the border. 
This heightens the chance that dan-
gerous individuals—from terrorists to 
drug smugglers, to human traffickers— 
will slip across the border into the 
country unnoticed. 
Drug trafficking across our southern 
border is a major problem and a prob-
lem that affects our entire country. 
There is a massive increase of fentanyl 
being smuggled across the border in 
States around the country, with total 
seizures up 134 percent and as high as 
1,000 percent in South Texas. Alarm-
ingly, fentanyl overdoses are now the 
leading cause of death for Americans 
aged 18 to 45. 
I have talked with local law enforce-
ment officials in South Dakota who re-
port that they regularly seize drugs 
that they can trace back to cartels 
trafficking them across our southern 
border. In other words, it is not just 
border States that are affected by secu-
rity problems at our borders. Every 
State in our Union is threatened by lax 
border security. 
Addressing 
the 
situation 
at 
our 
southern border should be one of this 
administration’s top priorities, but the 
President has been almost completely 
AWOL on this issue, as has his sup-
posed border czar, the Vice President. 
He seems to be hoping that if he ig-
nores this crisis long enough, it will go 
away. But it hasn’t gone away. In fact, 
it shows no signs of stopping. 
It is hard to overemphasize the depth 
of the President’s dereliction of duty 
on this issue. After all, it is the Presi-
dent’s job to deal with national secu-
rity and border enforcement. Yet the 
President continues to do essentially 
nothing to address the situation at our 
southern border. He can’t even be both-
ered to visit the border. In fact, there 
is reason to believe that the President 
has never, never visited the border— 
not as President, not as Vice President, 
and not even as a Senator—beyond 
driving by it once on the way to a cam-
paign rally in 2008. 
Of course, this situation isn’t just a 
matter of the President being derelict 
in his enforcement duties. The Presi-
dent is partly, if not largely, respon-
sible for the existence of this situation 
in the first place. 
Immediately upon taking office, the 
President took steps that weakened 
our Nation’s border security. On his 
very first day in office, the President 
rescinded the declaration of a national 
emergency at our southern border. He 
halted construction of the border wall, 
and he revoked a Trump administra-
tion order that called for the govern-
ment to faithfully execute our immi-
gration laws. That was all on his first 
day, and that wasn’t all. 
The 
President’s 
Department 
of 
Homeland Security also issued guide-
lines that same day pausing deporta-
tions except under certain conditions. 
The effect of all this was to declare to 
the world that the U.S. borders were ef-
fectively open, and the administration 
hasn’t made much of an effort to cor-
rect that impression. The President 
has significantly limited the ability of 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
and Customs and Border Protection to 
enforce immigration laws. 
Deportations dropped precipitously 
during fiscal year 2021, as did arrests in 
the interior of the country. And, of 
course, having a President who seems 
untroubled by the massive number of 
migrants attempting to cross our bor-
ders illegally hardly sends a discour-
aging message to those contemplating 
making the crossing themselves. 
There is simply nothing good to say 
about President Biden’s record on the 
border so far. His policies are not com-
passionate. There is nothing compas-
sionate about policies that invite ille-
gal immigration and encourage indi-
viduals to undertake the dangerous 
journey to our southern border. 
He has betrayed the duty he owes to 
the American people who should be 
able to count on their President to care 
about security concerns, including bor-
der security. 
We just marked the anniversary of 
the President’s first year in the White 
House, a year marked by disaster at 
our southern border. The President has 
a chance to change that record, to 
leave behind something other than bor-
der chaos to mark his time in office. 
But until we see real action from this 
administration, I am not going to get 
my hopes up. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, as I 
speak here today, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin has amassed 130,000 to 
150,000 soldiers on Ukraine’s doorstep 
in a show of force that could be a dress 
rehearsal for an invasion of Ukraine. 
But Putin’s inventory of tanks, infan-
try, and missiles is enabled by another 
dangerous weapon: Russia’s export of 
dirty energy, oil and gas. 
Our global addiction to fossil fuels, 
an addiction which Russia is only too 
happy to exploit, is kindling this po-
tential conflict. Without a worldwide 
clean energy revolution, we will never 
be able to quit this cycle of fossil fuel 
corruption and conflict. We will never 
be able to experience true independ-
ence from foreign interference. And we 
will never be able to protect our friends 
and our allies or ourselves from wars 
spurred by dirty energy profits. 
As long as Vladimir Putin can wield 
natural gas and oil as a threat against 
our country and our European allies 
and partners, we will always be on the 
defense. As long as Putin can wield gas 
prices and oil prices as a cudgel to re-
make borders, these crises will become 
a repeating drumbeat on the battlefield 
of history. As long as Putin can rely on 
global 
economic 
systems 
that 
are 
dominated by dirty fossil fuels instead 
of clean renewable energy, we will all 
remain vulnerable. 
The most effective way to reduce the 
long-term security threat to Ukraine 
and to Europe and to sovereign nations 
everywhere is to stop the spigot that 
puts billions of Euros and dollars into 
the hands of Vladimir Putin and his 
oligarch cronies in return for dirty 
fuels. 
In 2021, more than 36 percent of Rus-
sia’s Federal budget revenues came

February 16, 2022 
from oil and gas sales. This could fund 
annual 
Russian 
military 
activities 
more than twice over. 
The United States itself participates 
in these dirty profits. Seven percent of 
our oil imports come from Russia. We 
send billions of dollars a year to Putin, 
to those oil giants in Russia. We do it 
ourselves. 
Since 2015, Russia has used these oil 
and gas revenues to expand its cur-
rency reserves to $631 billion, the 
fourth largest reserve in the world. 
Why does this matter? Because the 
massive revenue chest dilutes the im-
pact of nonmilitary options to respond 
to Russia’s aggression. 
President Joe Biden is right to seek a 
diplomatic off-ramp to the current cri-
sis over Ukraine. This crisis has no 
military solution, but a long-term so-
lution has to include a comprehensive 
strategy that ends the globe’s deadly 
addiction to Russian fossil fuels. That 
strategy will only happen through an 
American-led clean energy revolution 
that frees the West from dependence on 
Putin’s pipelines. 
Many of my Republican colleagues 
think that the only way to address en-
ergy security is by building more pipe-
lines or drilling for more oil and gas. 
That is just plain wrong. Instead of 
doubling down on investments that 
align with Russia’s dirty energy busi-
ness model, we must lean into the in-
novation of clean energy technologies 
to fight against Russia. That is our 
competitive and strategic edge. Their 
vulnerability is that we are the techno-
logical giant of the planet, but we have 
to act like that and implement policies 
that reflect the fact that we are the 
technological giant. 
My Republican colleagues often come 
to the floor and attribute their fealty 
to oil and gas as a quest for energy se-
curity and independence when we know 
their calls for more domestic drilling 
are nothing more than a ploy for prof-
its by the Big Oil companies. While 
families and workers are getting tipped 
upside down at the gasoline pump 
every single day, oil companies are 
stuffing billions into their pockets. 
Exxon, Conoco, and Chevron made 
more than $45 billion in profits last 
year as gas prices increased by more 
than 40 percent. 
Republicans 
call 
these 
price 
in-
creases ‘‘supply constraints’’ and incor-
rectly blame President Biden’s energy 
policies. But here are the actual facts: 
Daily 
domestic 
oil 
production 
re-
mained constant between 2020 and 2021, 
at 12 million barrels of oil a day. We 
are producing as much today in the 
Biden administration as we were pro-
ducing during the Trump administra-
tion. So I just don’t want to continue 
to hear this from the Republican side. 
What they are saying is not true. 
Here are some more facts that the 
American Petroleum Institute, or the 
‘‘American Prevarication Institute,’’ 
and my Republican colleagues seem to 
omit: In 2021, 3 million of those 12 mil-
lion barrels were exported to foreign 
countries. 
Let me say that again. Of the 12 mil-
lion barrels of oil that we actually 
drilled for here in the United States, 3 
million of those barrels were exported 
around the world. 
Who wanted to export those barrels 
of oil? The American Petroleum Insti-
tute. And we are exporting them 
abroad because, in 2015, Republicans 
voted to end the decades-long export 
ban on sending oil overseas. It was 
their votes that paved the way to send 
American oil overseas. It was their 
votes that aligned with the American 
Petroleum Institute that results today 
in 3 million barrels of oil a day leaving 
the United States, as we see these croc-
odile tears about oil imports and ex-
ports from the American Petroleum In-
stitute, from the Republican Party. 
So you can’t say, out of one side of 
your mouth, ‘‘energy independence’’ 
but, out of the other side, ‘‘export, 
baby, export.’’ That is what the Repub-
lican Party has stood for; that is what 
the American Petroleum Institute ad-
vocated for and got as a new American 
policy after four decades, in 2015. And 
the more oil we drill for here at home, 
the more likely Big Oil will sell Amer-
ican consumers out to the highest bid-
der abroad for our oil. 
Republicans owe Americans at the 
pump an apology for putting us in this 
situation. We cannot support a busi-
ness model where Big Oil drills for en-
ergy in the United States, only to sell 
that product to China at the expense of 
the American consumer. 
In November of 2020, I requested a 
Federal report that revealed that the 
repeal of the 2015 crude oil export ban 
increased U.S. crude exports—while im-
ports remained largely unchanged—and 
resulted in higher oil costs. 
The first step to true energy inde-
pendence is to reinstate the ban on ex-
porting American crude oil and natural 
gas abroad. The other step must be 
equally aggressive: aggressive invest-
ments in clean energy, in wind, in 
solar, in all-electric vehicles, in bat-
tery storage technologies, in new met-
als, new inventions, so that we don’t 
have to import that oil from Russia or 
from any other place in the world, so 
that we can break our addiction to the 
Russian oil that comes into our coun-
try right now, even as we speak on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate, because that 
hurts American working families. It 
hurts vulnerable communities in our 
country. 
Our fossil fuel addiction is a catalyst 
for conflict. A clean energy Green New 
Deal would be a pathway for peace. The 
position of my Republican colleagues 
represents 
the 
kind 
of 
short-term 
thinking that will harm our long-term 
national security, the security of our 
European partners and allies, and the 
health of our planet. 
If we export more American natural 
gas to our allies in Europe, fuel prices 
would 
increase 
for 
American 
con-
sumers and the Russian Government 
would continue to profit by simply re-
directing its fossil fuel supply to Asia. 
Putin would still be able to use his oil 
and natural gas revenue to threaten 
the sovereignty of free and democratic 
countries. And as a top three oil and 
natural gas producer, Russia will con-
tinue to have significant influence on 
energy supply and pricing as long as 
there continues to be global demand 
for its oil and gas exports, whether 
that demand is Eastern Asia or Eastern 
Europe. 
This is not theoretical. Just last 
week, Russia and China inked a 30-year 
deal through which Russia will send 
natural gas worth $80 billion a year to 
China. In addition to whom Russia 
sells its oil and gas, we must start fo-
cusing on why Russia has a market for 
its oil and gas in the first place. 
This is a demand-side problem. Let’s 
demand some answers. If we are serious 
about addressing fossil fuel demand, 
let’s switch to clean energy and make 
smart investments in electric transpor-
tation. We don’t need more gas pumps; 
we need more heat pumps for heating 
and cooling. We don’t need more pipe-
lines; we need more transmission lines 
to deliver safe, secure, and reliable 
clean energy. And we don’t need more 
mass destruction; we need mass con-
struction of clean, industrial facilities, 
clean manufacturing, clean cars here in 
the United States and worldwide. 
If we are serious about ending Rus-
sia’s oil and natural gas blackmail, we 
should invest in energy-efficient tech-
nologies that get us off the fossil fuel 
that threatens our planet and threat-
ens the security of Europe. We need to 
build electric cars and trucks so Amer-
icans and Europeans will never again 
be at the mercy of global energy mar-
kets led by Russia and OPEC. 
We need to build electric heat pumps 
so our European allies no longer have 
to rely on Putin’s natural gas to heat 
their homes in the winter. 
And we need to build clean energy 
manufacturing facilities here in the 
United States so that we can export 
clean energy technologies to Europe 
and create jobs here at home. We need 
to make the wind turbines here in the 
United States. We need to make the 
solar panels here in the United States. 
We need to make the battery tech-
nologies here in the United States. We 
need to make the all-electric vehicles 
here in the United States. That has to 
be our plan. 
That will frighten Putin. That will 
frighten all of the rest of his petrol 
buddies right now having a little con-
fab in Sochi. That will frighten him. 
But we cannot preach temperance from 
a barstool. So the United States must 
lead our European allies in the clean 
energy revolution to protect us all 
from Russia, yes, but also from the ex-
istential threat of climate change 
caused by dirty fuels. 
If the United States leads with gov-
ernment investment in clean energy, 
we will drive down the cost curve for 
these clean energy technologies and 
spread this widespread adoption in the 
United States and Europe and across 
the planet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S730 
February 16, 2022 
Just look at the power that clean en-
ergy already has in our country. The 
clean energy sector was one of the Na-
tion’s fastest growing job sectors. 
Solar jobs: In 2010, we had 93,000 
workers. By now, we have 345,000. 
Wind jobs: In 2010, 75,000 employees. 
By 2020, up to 114,000. 
Energy efficiency jobs: 830,000 in 2010. 
Now, it is up to 2.1 million people 
working in energy efficiency in our 
country. 
That worker power is matched by ac-
tual power. Just listen to these genera-
tion achievements. We have gone from 
1,200 megawatts of solar in 2008 to 
120,000 megawatts today. 
For wind, it has gone from 25,000 to 
143,000 megawatts. All-electric vehi-
cles—there were only 2,500 all-electric 
vehicles in the United States in 2008. 
That was a crime, that we had fallen so 
far behind, that the auto industry in 
the United States just sat down on the 
job, but by 2030, we are now expecting 
18 million new jobs—18 million new 
electric vehicles on the streets of our 
country. 
This is America’s strength. This is 
where we can dominate the world—the 
clean energy economy. We will not free 
ourselves from Putin’s energy clutches 
by staring down the dark barrel of a 
gun but by harnessing the clean energy 
of the Sun. 
If Vladimir Putin’s market for fossil 
fuel shrinks, so does his ability to fi-
nance threats and sow division around 
the world. In order to defuse tensions 
around Europe, we need a revolution— 
a clean energy revolution. 
Our 
wind 
turbines 
are 
weapons 
against Russia’s pipelines. Our solar 
panels are shields against Siberian oil. 
Together 
with 
the 
EU’s 
European 
Green Deal, that is how we will fight 
and win the clean energy revolution 
that will finally disarm Putin’s dirty 
regime. 
Our first step is to pass the climate 
justice and clean energy provisions 
from the Build Back Better bill. That 
$555 billion investment includes tax 
credits and rebates in clean energy, 
heat pumps, all-electric vehicles, ad-
vanced domestic manufacturing, wind 
and solar, which will be made in Amer-
ica. A clean economy will be created. 
Those credits are coupled with a 
technology-neutral climate and clean 
energy bank that will help finance the 
clean economy and a Civilian Climate 
Corps, which will train the next gen-
eration of young people and workers to 
bring jobs and justice to our local com-
munities. 
We need to deploy one of our greatest 
assets against Putin: American inge-
nuity and the American workers, a 
well-trained, 
well-paid 
battalion 
of 
American workers who will build our 
clean energy revolution with jobs that 
cannot be outsourced. This clean en-
ergy revolution is worth fighting for, 
and I know we can do it. 
Now we need to build on the past 12 
years of domestic clean energy success 
and help build European economies 
that no longer have to rely on Vladimir 
Putin to heat their homes and power 
their cars. 
The United States imports Russian 
oil. Europe imports Russian gas. What 
if, instead, we exported climate innova-
tion and leadership to the world? That 
is the clean energy revolution that 
could stem the possibility of war and 
climate catastrophe. 
We don’t need Russia’s oil any more 
than we need Russia’s caviar if we are 
serious in our country. We need a new 
NATO that comes together and forges 
an alliance to deploy all-electric vehi-
cles, to deploy wind and solar, so we 
back out the oil and gas—not only in 
Europe, not only in the United States, 
but all around the world—that we use. 
This is our moment. We have a 
chance here in the U.S. Senate to re-
spond. But I don’t want to hear any-
thing more from the American Petro-
leum Institute—the ‘‘American Pre-
varication Institute.’’ Their policies 
are the ones that we are living with 
today. Those are the policies that must 
change. That is the only way in which 
we can meet this healthcare, environ-
mental, national security, and moral 
issue of all time. If we do it, genera-
tions in the future will look back and 
say that we responded to that chal-
lenge.

SUPER BOWL LVI 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, like 
many 
Americans, 
Nebraskans 
were 
rooting for the Bengals on Sunday. Ev-
eryone loves a good underdog story. 
The Bengals hadn’t won a playoff game 
in more than 30 years until this season, 
and they were effectively the visiting 
team in a Super Bowl that was played 
in Los Angeles against the L.A. Rams. 
Outside of Ohio, Nebraska may have 
more connection to the Bengals than 
any other State. To start, Bengals 
quarterback Joe Burrow has deep roots 
in Nebraska. Both of his brothers, 
Jamie and Dan, played for the Huskers 
in the early 2000s. His mom Robin grew 
up in Tecumseh, NE, and Burrow has 
uncles and other relatives scattered 
around southeast Nebraska. 
His grandfather Wayne is a farmer in 
Johnson County. Wayne has watched 
every Super Bowl for 56 years, going 
back to Super Bowl I in 1967. This year 
was the first time he has attended the 
big game in person to cheer on his 
grandson and the Bengals. 
Maybe best of all, Joe Burrow’s dad 
played for the Nebraska Huskers in the 
seventies before going on to a career in 
the NFL and the Canadian Football 
League. Later, as an assistant coach, 
he was part of the Husker team that 
took on No. 1 Miami in the 2002 Rose 
Bowl. Husker football fans remember 
that game as the last time Nebraska 
has played for a national champion-
ship—not good. Five-year-old Joe Bur-
row was there in Pasadena to support 
his dad, making Sunday’s Super Bowl 
the second time he has traveled to L.A. 
for a national title game. 
Even by themselves, Joe Burrow’s 
Nebraska connections would have been 
enough to make Husker Nation pull for 
the Bengals, but Bengals Coach Zac 
Taylor is another reason that Nebras-
kans were with Cincinnati on Sunday. 
He was the Huskers’ starting quarter-
back for the 2005 and 2006 seasons, 
throwing for nearly 6,000 yards and 45 
touchdowns. He was also the last 
Cornhusker to win the Big 12 Offensive 
Player of the Year Award. 
He credits his success as a player to 
Nebraska’s coach at the time, Bill Cal-
lahan. Now, he has Brian Callahan, 
Bill’s son, on his staff as his offensive 
coordinator. Troy Walters, the Ben-
gals’ wide receivers coach, was Nebras-
ka’s offensive coordinator from 2017 to 
2019. 
Another Bengals player with Ne-
braska ties is Stanley Morgan. He 
signed with the Bengals in 2019 after a 
stellar college career with the Huskers, 
and he is easily one of the best receiv-
ers in Husker football history. Morgan 
rewrote 
Nebraska’s 
wide 
receiver 
record books from 2015 to 2018. He holds 
the record for career receptions and re-
ceiving yards and also for single-season 
receiving yards. With that last record, 
he eclipsed the previous total Nebraska 
football legend Johnny Rodgers set on 
his way to winning the Heisman Tro-
phy in 1972. Now Morgan has a bright 
future ahead of him in the NFL. 
Nebraska’s connections to this Ben-
gals team is strong. The team came up 
just short on Sunday, but Nebraskans 
are proud of what they accomplished 
this season. Joe Burrow and Zac Taylor 
led this team of underdogs to a game 
no one expected to see them in, and 
they ended the longest active playoffs 
drought in the NFL while they were at 
it. 
Things are looking up for this Ne-
braska-led team. I look forward to see-
ing them in the playoffs again next 
year. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
finish my remarks prior to the sched-
uled vote at 11:30. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, at the 
end of this month, the U.S. Supreme 
Court is slated to hear oral arguments 
in the case of West Virginia v. EPA, in 
which the Justices will consider the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s authority to regulate greenhouse 
gas emissions. The stakes could not be 
higher. This case will have lasting im-
pacts in Maryland, the Nation, and the 
planet. 
As we follow the science and work to 
mitigate the damaging impacts of cli-
mate change, it is imperative that the 
Court respect EPA’s authority, which

Congress granted, to regulate green-
house gas emissions to protect public 
health and the environment. 
I would like to take a moment to 
consider where we are and how we got 
here. 
At issue in the case is the question of 
whether EPA acted outside of its statu-
tory authority when it promulgated in 
2015 the Clean Power Plan, the CPP, 
which established guidelines for States 
to limit carbon dioxide emissions from 
powerplants. The Trump administra-
tion repealed the CPP and issued in its 
place the Affordable Clean Energy rule, 
which eliminated or deferred the guide-
lines. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
DC Circuit vacated the Affordable 
Clean Energy rule as arbitrary and ca-
pricious. 
One of the challengers, North Amer-
ican Coal Corporation, challenged how 
broad the EPA’s authority is to regu-
late greenhouse gas emissions. 
Notably, the Clean Power Plan was 
never implemented. Yet several of the 
parties challenging the plan are asking 
the Supreme Court to issue a decision 
far beyond whether the CPP con-
stitutes a reasonable interpretation of 
section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The 
challengers have put forth interpreta-
tions of two legal doctrines—the non-
delegation and major questions doc-
trines—that could, if adopted, strip 
EPA of its authority to regulate green-
house gases entirely. 
The Supreme Court has spoken on 
the Clean Air Act. In 2007, in Massa-
chusetts v. EPA, a Supreme Court deci-
sion ruled that EPA has the authority 
to regulate heat-trapping gases in vehi-
cle emissions. The majority found that 
the Agency could not sidestep its au-
thority to regulate greenhouse gases 
that 
contribute 
to 
global 
climate 
change unless it could prove a sci-
entific basis for its refusal. There is 
none. 
The same year, in Environmental De-
fense v. Duke Energy, the Court ruled 
unanimously with regards to the EPA’s 
authority to regulate factories and 
powerplants that add capacity or make 
renovations that increase emissions of 
air pollutants. 
In the current case of West Virginia 
v. EPA, I joined Chairman CARPER’s 
amicus brief with nearly 200 Members 
of Congress. The brief illustrates EPA’s 
authority under the Clean Air Act to 
protect the public from harmful pollu-
tion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
and address the climate crisis. It also 
rejects arguments made by the peti-
tioners challenging the EPA’s author-
ity to address carbon pollution. It is 
among a notable number of briefs filed 
in this case, many citing my home 
State of Maryland. 
In their brief in support of the re-
spondents, climate scientists observe 
that heavy rain and snowstorms across 
most of the United States have in-
creased in both intensity and frequency 
since 2001. The Northeast region also 
faces flooding, particularly in the his-
toric districts of cities like Annapolis, 
MD—home to the U.S. Naval Acad-
emy—and Newport, RI, as well as por-
tions of Washington, DC, near the 
Tidal Basin. For example, human- 
caused climate change made the excep-
tionally heavy precipitation and flood-
ing events that occurred in 2018 in 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, 
and Washington, DC, up to 2.3 times 
more likely. 
The Washington Post reported that 
more than 40 percent of Americans live 
in counties hit by climate-related dis-
asters in 2021, including three in Mary-
land: St. Mary’s County and Calvert 
County in Southern Maryland and Dor-
chester County along Maryland’s East-
ern Shore. According to FEMA data, 
each 
suffered 
declared 
disasters 
spawned by hurricanes. 
Because of the vulnerability in my 
home State, I took direct action in 
2019. I was proud to lead an effort with 
over 20 of my colleagues in a joint reso-
lution providing for the congressional 
disapproval of the Trump administra-
tion’s repeal of the Clean Power Plan. 
Maryland is at risk not only to ex-
treme weather events but also to slow- 
onset climate impacts that are equally 
damaging. 
The National Parks Conservation As-
sociation in its brief remarks on Mary-
land’s cultural history: 
The Harriet Tubman Underground Rail-
road National Historical Park is located in 
. . . Maryland. The approximate elevation of 
the park is a mere three feet above sea level 
and is surrounded by the inlets of the Chesa-
peake Bay. Viewed another way, 3 feet is half 
the depth of one-quarter of the bay. 
As water levels continue to rise, this na-
tional historic park may be permanently 
lost. 
The National Park Conservation As-
sociation’s brief discusses the obliga-
tions Congress conferred on EPA to 
protect public lands and their re-
sources. 
On February 15, NOAA announced the 
interagency ‘‘Sea Level Rise Technical 
Report,’’ which provides the most up- 
to-date sea level rise scenarios, avail-
able for all U.S. States and territories. 
The report projects sea levels along the 
coastline will rise an additional 10 to 12 
inches by 2050, with specific amounts 
varying regionally, mainly due to land 
height changes. 
This effort is a product of the inter-
agency Sea Level Rise and Coastal 
Flood Hazard and Tool Task Force, 
comprised 
of 
NOAA, 
NASA, 
EPA, 
USGS, Department of Defense, FEMA, 
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
as well as several academic institu-
tions. The report leverages methods 
and insights from both the United Na-
tions Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change ‘‘Sixth Assessment Re-
port’’ and supporting research from the 
U.S. Department of Defense regional 
sea level database. The report tells us 
that the United States is expected to 
experience as much sea level rise by 
the year 2050 as it witnessed in the pre-
vious 100 years, and it must serve as a 
wake-up call. 
Maryland’s urban and suburban cen-
ters, in addition to our rural commu-
nities and coasts, are in danger. The 
National League of Cities and the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors in their brief 
state that Baltimore, MD, as well as 
other major cities, including Wash-
ington, DC, Philadelphia, and Boston, 
have all experienced significant in-
creases in exposure to wildfire smoke 
that prevailing winds carry across the 
country. 
State and local governments are tak-
ing action. In their brief, the National 
League of Cities and the U.S. Con-
ference of Mayors cite that in 2013, 
‘‘Baltimore developed comprehensive 
responses—touching 
infrastructure, 
building codes, natural coastal bar-
riers, and public services—to threats 
from rising seas, heat waves, and 
storms. [In central Maryland], Annap-
olis developed a first-in-the-nation Cul-
tural 
Resources 
Hazard 
Mitigation 
Plan in 2018 to mitigate climate im-
pacts on important cultural and histor-
ical landmarks, and the Eastern Shore 
Climate Adaptation Partnership has 
brought together local governments 
from across the Eastern Shore to pre-
pare for climate impacts.’’ 
Private companies, too, are among 
subnational actors that are all-in on 
climate. 
Maryland’s 
McCormick 
& 
Company has set a new, more ambi-
tious goal for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions 42 percent by 2030, after 
achieving its prior target of 20 percent 
by 2025—4 years earlier than expected. 
The spice manufacturer and Fortune 
500 company has also announced a new 
commitment to achieve net zero emis-
sions by 2050, in line with the enhanced 
U.S. National Determined Contribution 
Secretary Kerry delivered ahead of the 
COP26 meeting that occurred last year. 
But the company cannot mitigate cli-
mate change alone. The Federal Gov-
ernment must support it. The Clean 
Air Act is an essential tool by which 
we do so. 
Through the Build Back Better agen-
da and elsewhere, Congress is taking an 
all-of-the-above strategy to combat cli-
mate change, complemented by the 
Biden administration’s whole-of-gov-
ernment approach. 
I am proud that the draft Senate En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee title to fulfill reconciliation in-
structions includes funding legislation 
to make Federal buildings greener. But 
more is needed. The legislation also in-
cludes funding for water utilities to en-
hance their resilience to natural haz-
ards as authorized by the bipartisan In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
The Supreme Court must tread care-
fully in curtailing any specific tool, in-
cluding the Clean Air Act, and must 
not intercede where legislative efforts 
to curb EPA’s authority have failed. 
Conversely, we must continue to pur-
sue as many avenues as possible to deal 
with the climate crisis. 
I yield the floor.

The

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of David A. 
Honey, of Virginia, to be Deputy Under 
Secretary of Defense. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD NOMINATIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is a 
pivotal moment for our country and for 
our economy. Everyone understands we 
need a full Federal Reserve Board. 
Once we move the President’s nomi-
nees and get them confirmed and get 
them sworn in, it will be the first time 
in nearly a decade that the Federal Re-
serve has had a full complement of 
seven Fed Governors. That is especially 
important with the upcoming meeting 
of the Federal Reserve in March be-
cause the Fed’s job is to tackle infla-
tion and bring prices down for Amer-
ican families. 
It is a pretty simple equation. The 
President nominates. I mean, it didn’t 
happen in the last few years, but the 
President nominates. We have hear-
ings. We ask some questions. We send 
them followup questions. The nominees 
answer these questions. That is how 
this place works. That is a good thing 
about this place. 
Then we call the vote in committee, 
and we vote yes or no. The job is vote 
yes or vote no and hope your side pre-
vails. 
And that is what Americans think we 
should do. Every day Americans get up, 
go to work, and do their jobs. But Sen-
ate Republicans didn’t do theirs yester-
day. 
We had our markup, a meeting to 
confirm five—just five—nominees for 
the Federal Reserve. The Chair of the 
Federal Reserve, appointed originally 
by President Trump, has been renomi-
nated by President Biden. His nomina-
tion we were voting on; the Vice Chair, 
Lael Brainard, who has been on the Fed 
some time; and then three new Fed 
slots that have been vacant for some 
time: Sarah Bloom Raskin, who would 
be Vice Chair of Supervision, a very 
important job at the Fed; and the other 
two, also important jobs, Lisa Cook 
and Philip Jefferson. All five of these 
nominations we wanted to vote on yes-
terday. 
Three weeks ago, Senator TOOMEY, 
the leading Republican on the com-
mittee, he and I agreed it would be yes-
terday; that the vote would be yester-
day and we would meet at 2:15 and vote 
them up or down. And everybody—all 
14 of us get a vote. 
Well, under Senate rules, if one party 
doesn’t want to play ball, they don’t

show up, and we can’t do business. So 
all 12 Democrats showed up. We wanted 
to vote. We actually took an informal 
vote, which passed 12 to 0, for essen-
tially all six of them. There was one 
‘‘no’’ on one of them. But Republicans 
didn’t show up. 
So, as I said, Americans every day 
get up, go to work, and do their jobs. 
They expect us to get up every day, go 
to work, and do our jobs. But Repub-
licans are AWOL in the fight against 
inflation. If we are going to get serious 
about inflation, we need a Federal Re-
serve in place. We need all seven Fed 
Governors in place, ready to work, 
ready to debate and make decisions 
about monetary policy, about interest 
rates, about jobs, about attacking in-
flation. 
Americans—in Boulder or Denver or 
Cleveland 
or 
Columbus, 
Americans 
don’t want more political theatrics. 
They want solutions to bring down 
their costs. And Republicans, they 
have been great at coming to the floor 
and speaking against inflation. They 
have got their political stunts. But 
when it really came time to show up 
and do their job, they just simply 
didn’t show up yesterday to do their 
jobs. All 12 Democrats were there ready 
to go. All 12 of us wanted to move for-
ward on these 5 nominations for the 
Federal Reserve, and under Senate 
rules we simply couldn’t act officially 
to get this done. 
So I know that the ranking mem-
ber—I understand he doesn’t want to do 
this for whatever reasons. He doesn’t 
like her position on climate change. He 
doesn’t like it that she is going to—the 
one he is complaining most about, he 
doesn’t like it that she is going to 
stand up to Wall Street and not roll 
over for Wall Street every time Wall 
Street, you know, rattles the Fed’s 
chains. He knows that, and he probably 
doesn’t like that, but he is hanging his 
hat on some issue that really makes 
very little sense. 
Sarah Bloom Raskin, the person 
whom he is most complaining about, 
over a weekend, had 48 hours to answer 
more than 180 questions from Senator 
TOOMEY and his colleagues. She an-
swered them all in 48 hours. Then, even 
outside of the Senate rules, more ques-
tions were sent to her. She answered 
those questions. 
So it is really about the fact that far 
too many people here pay far too much 
attention to the oil company lobby, 
but that is really neither here nor 
there. Everyday Americans, as I say, 
get up, go to work, do their jobs. Sen-
ate Republicans must do theirs. 
Pure and simple, Republicans are 
AWOL in the fight against inflation. 
We are not going to stop fighting for 
these nominees. The American people 
want us to vote. Some people vote yes, 
some no. I am fine with that. But the 
American people want us to do our 
jobs. 
When you come here, there aren’t 
three boxes: vote yes, vote no, or check 
a box that says: I don’t want to come 
to work today; I am not going to vote. 
No, they want us to vote. So we will 
keep fighting for these nominees. 
I implore at least 1 Republican of the 
12 on the committee to come to our 
next markup, our next vote, our next 
executive session so we can vote on 
these nominees. I want the Federal Re-
serve, for the first time in a decade, to 
all be there pulling in the same direc-
tion, fighting inflation for our country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

f 
HEALTH CARE FOR BURN PIT 
VETERANS ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon here on the Senate floor 
to mark what will soon be the passage, 
in just a matter of moments, of a vital 
veterans bill and to thank my col-
leagues—both Republicans and Demo-
crats—who came together to support 
the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans 
Act. This is an important bill, and it 
will remove hurdles for post-9/11 Iraq 
and 
Afghanistan 
veterans, 
in 
par-
ticular, who were exposed to burn pits, 
so they can receive healthcare from the 
VA without delay. 
This legislation is cosponsored by 
every single member of the Senate VA 
Committee, and I commend each of my 
Senate colleagues in their support for 
this legislation. 
Supporting our veterans has a way of 
bringing us together, and I am so glad 
that is true. I am on the floor this 
afternoon with the Chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, 
and I appreciate how he and my Senate 
colleagues understand the urgency of 
this bill and are quickly moving to 
pass it by unanimous consent. 
Post-9/11 veterans are the newest 
generation of American heroes to suf-
fer from toxic exposure encountered 
during military service; and passing 
this legislation marks just a first 
step—a first step—of a phased approach 
to solving the complex challenges of 
caring for those veterans exposed to 
burn pits and other toxic exposures. 
For way too long, we have heard 
from veterans who got sick after expo-
sure to burn pits and need lifesaving 
care. There is a bipartisan consensus 
on our committee that this phased ap-
proach—delivering healthcare now and 
reforming the benefit system next—is 
the most effective pathway forward for 
toxic exposure veterans and all other 
veterans as well. 
Servicemembers are willing to make 
the ultimate sacrifice for their coun-
try. We know that. We respect that. We 
honor that. We must match that level 
of commitment by crafting thoughtful 
and effective solutions to make certain 
we hold up our end of the bargain and 
continuously work toward the best 
outcomes for those who served and sac-
rificed. 
I once joined a roundtable in Wichita, 
KS, with local members of the Vietnam 
Veterans of America and was moved by 
their stories—not only of their own 
health consequences from Agent Or-
ange but their concerns of how their 
exposure was affecting the health of 
their children and grandchildren. From 
that veteran feedback, I introduced the 
Toxic Exposure Research Act with Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL, which was signed 
into law in 2016. 
I have since heard from many vet-
erans in Kansas and across the country 
who are sick and dying from the effects 
of toxic exposure caused by burn pits. 
Addressing the needs of veterans ex-
posed to burn pits cannot wait. This 
legislation could be lifesaving for those 
exposed or suffering. When our men 
and women in uniform go into harm’s 
way on our behalf, we owe it to them to 
take care of them when they come 
home for whatever injuries are in-
curred during their service. This is not 
a question of resources; this is a ques-
tion of getting reform done the right 
way. 
The Senate soon will act to pass this 
bill, moving us closer to completing 
phase 1 of this approach to provide 
timely, sustainable care to our vet-
erans. I will continue to work with vet-
erans, advocates in the VA, and, impor-
tantly, my colleagues on the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and its 
chairman, Senator TESTER, of Mon-
tana, to make sure we are crafting leg-
islative solutions that are veteran-cen-
tric. 
I call upon my colleagues in the 
House to quickly take action and act 
on this bill and act on our promise as 
a nation so post-9/11 veterans who are 
suffering from toxic exposures can get 
the care they need. 
I thank my colleagues on the com-
mittee, Chairman TESTER, and our re-
spective staffs for working to craft this 
feasible path forward. And I want to 
thank many veteran organizations that 
have expressed their support for this 
legislation, including the Disabled Vet-
erans of America, Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, the Wounded Warrior Project, 
Iraq and American Veterans of Amer-
ica, the American Legion, Military Of-
ficers Association of America, and 
Military-Veterans Advocacy. 
I am confident that if we continue to 
work together with the VA and with 
veterans’ groups, we will keep the 
needs of veterans foremost in our 
minds and that we can deliver mean-
ingful reforms for the current genera-
tion of veterans and for all those who 
come thereafter. 
I yield the floor to the Senator from 
Montana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my friend, the Senator from 
Kansas, Senator MORAN, the ranking

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S734 
February 16, 2022 
member of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. 
When we started this Congress, the 
No. 1 issue that was put forth by the 
veterans 
service 
organizations 
rep-
resenting the veterans in this country 
was toxic exposure. It was incumbent 
that the Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
do something about toxic exposure. We 
created the bill called the COST of 
War. 
We are at a point now where we are 
going to try to implement that bill in 
phases. The phase we are working on 
today has six major components to it. 
No. 1, it expands the screening period 
of healthcare eligibility for combat 
veterans who served after September 
11, 2001, from 5 years to 10. No. 2, it pro-
vides an open enrollment period for 
any post-9/11 combat veteran who is 
more than 10 years from separation. 
No. 3, after we do the first two things, 
it tells the VA to have an outreach 
plan to contact veterans who did not 
enroll during their initial period of en-
hanced eligibility so that they can sign 
up for the potential benefits. It directs 
the VA to incorporate a clinical screen-
ing regarding a veteran’s potential ex-
posures and symptoms commonly asso-
ciated with toxic substances. The fifth 
thing it does is it mandates toxic expo-
sure early education and training for 
healthcare and benefits personnel who 
work at the VA. And, finally, it 
strengthens Federal research on toxic 
exposure. 
This is a big bill; it is an important 
bill; and it does right by our veterans 
in this country. Toxic exposure is not 
something that is new. We have dealt 
with it since World War I, World War 
II, Agent Orange, and the Vietnam war, 
and, right now, toxic exposure due to 
burn pits. 
When we get done with this process, 
it is not going to take an act of Con-
gress to get the benefits they need to 
get moving into the future. This is a 
giant step forward in that regard. 
So I want to thank both the minority 
and majority staffs, the Senator from 
Kansas, who has been an incredible 
help to be able to work together to get 
this to the point where it is today. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 263, S. 3541. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3541) to improve health care and 
services for veterans exposed to toxic sub-
stances, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. TESTER. I know of no further 
debate on the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate on the bill, the bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass? 
The bill (S. 3541) was passed as fol-
lows:

resentatives of the United States of America in

ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is 
important, I think, that we acknowl-
edge a very simple truth that few peo-
ple can disagree with and that is we are 
living at this moment in the most dif-
ficult time of our lives. 
I say to the American people, if you 
are feeling anxious, feeling depressed, 
if you are feeling overwhelmed, if you 
are feeling confused, if you are feeling 
angry, you are not alone. Many mil-
lions of Americans feel exactly the 
same way. 
This pandemic has had a devastating 
and horrific impact upon our country. 
Over 900,000 people have died from 
COVID and tens of millions have been 
made ill. Many thousands of workers 
have lost their jobs simply because 
they went about doing their jobs. They 
had to go to work. They were critical 
workers and many thousands died as a 
result. 
In the midst of the pandemic, in an 
unprecedented way, millions of other 
workers have chosen to find new em-
ployment paths. They have given up 
their old jobs. 
But it is not just working people who 
have been impacted; it has been a ter-
rible time for the young people of our 
country. The education of our younger 
generation, from childcare to graduate 
school, has been severely disrupted in a 
way that we have never seen in the 
modern history of this country. 
But, again, it is not just for workers 
or the children; it is for elderly people. 
You have senior citizens in this coun-
try who have died at alarmingly high 
rates, but in addition to that, they 
have been isolated over the last several 
years because of fear of catching the 
virus, which means that they can’t 
come in contact with their kids or 
their grandchildren. They can’t get out 
of the house, and they are hurting as a 
result.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S736 
February 16, 2022 
In America today, it is no great se-
cret—an issue we are trying to deal 
with—that mental illness is on the rise 
as is drug addiction, alcoholism, and 
domestic violence. In other words, 
these are difficult and, in fact, unprec-
edented times within our lives. 
But what I want to point out this 
afternoon is that while the vast major-
ity of people in our country are hurting 
emotionally, they are hurting economi-
cally. These are not difficult times for 
everybody. That is an important point 
to be made. 
In fact, I want to start off, if I might, 
with some really, really good news if 
you are a billionaire in this country or 
a CEO of a large corporation. 
For those people, these times have 
not been bad; they, in fact, have been 
very, very good. In fact, if you are one 
of the very richest people in this coun-
try, this moment right now has never 
been better for you than anytime in 
American history. 
Today, corporate profits are at an 
alltime high, and CEOs, heads of large 
corporations, have seen huge increases 
in their compensation packages. Let 
me just give a few examples. 
Everybody in America is worried 
about the high price of gas. You drive 
around, and today, gas prices are high-
er than they were yesterday. 
While gas prices are soaring, shock of 
all shock, oil company profits are now 
higher than they have been in over 7 
years. Gas prices are soaring, and— 
guess what—large oil companies are 
making huge profits. In fact, in the 
last quarter, ExxonMobil, Chevron, 
Shell, and BP made nearly $25 billion 
in profits in one quarter. 
Gas prices are soaring. The profits of 
the oil companies are soaring as well. 
But that is not all. Everybody is wor-
ried about higher food prices. Many 
senior citizens living on fixed incomes 
go to the grocery store, and they get 
very upset about seeing increased 
prices on meat and vegetables and ev-
erything else. 
Well, it turns out that the food in-
dustry is also enjoying huge increases 
in profits. In fact, Kroger, one of the 
largest grocery store chains in Amer-
ica, made a recordbreaking profit of 
some $4 billion in 2021. While their 
stock price dropped 36 percent in the 
past year, its CEO got a 296-percent 
pay raise over the past decade. They 
have been able to spend $1.5 billion on 
stock buybacks and dividends to enrich 
their wealthy shareholders. 
Food prices are soaring. Yet company 
after company in the food industry is 
making huge profits. 
For the people on top, the good news 
is that it is not just that corporate 
profits have never been better—that is 
good news—but even better for them is 
that CEO compensation has never been 
higher. 
You know, there was a time way 
back in the 1950s when I was growing 
up when CEOs did very, very well. They 
made 20 times more than their average 
worker. Well, if you are a CEO, the 
good news is, those days are long gone 
when you only made 20 times more 
than your average worker. Today, as I 
am sure the CEOs of this country 
know, they are now making 350 times 
more than what the average worker in 
America makes—350 times more. Talk 
about greed. 
By the way, at a time when we pay 
the highest prices in the world for pre-
scription drugs, the really, really good 
news is that the CEOs of the top eight 
pharmaceutical companies in America 
made over $350 million in compensa-
tion in 2020. Got that? Eight CEOs of 
the drug companies that charge the 
highest prices in the world for prescrip-
tion drugs made $350 million collec-
tively in compensation. 
If that is not good enough news for 
the billionaire class, let me give you 
some even better news. Today, the bil-
lionaire class owns more income and 
wealth percentagewise than at any 
time in American history as a result of 
a massive transfer of wealth. 
You know, we hear a lot of talk 
about transfer of wealth—oh my God, 
we can’t tax the rich and transfer 
wealth; terrible; terrible—but there has 
been over the last many decades a huge 
transfer of wealth. The only problem 
is, it has gone in the wrong direction— 
from working families to the top 1 per-
cent. As a result of that, what we have 
now is that the top 1 percent owns 
more wealth than the bottom 92 per-
cent. The top 1 percent owns more 
wealth than the bottom 92 percent. 
Rather amazingly, the two wealthi-
est people in America now own more 
wealth than the bottom 42 percent. 
Two people own more wealth than the 
bottom 42 percent. You know, in this 
country, we pride ourselves on being a 
country that believes in fairness, that 
believes in justice—justice for all. It is 
not fair, it is not just that two people 
now own more wealth than the bottom 
42 percent of the American people— 
that is wealth, accumulated income. 
In terms of income, what we earn in 
a given year, since the Wall Street 
crash of 2008, the top 1 percent has 
earned 45 percent of all new income 
created in this country. Got a hundred 
people; the guy on top earns 45 percent 
of all of that income. 
You know, every day, as you well 
know, Members of the Senate and the 
House go to the floor to give congratu-
latory remarks to the Boy Scouts, con-
gratulating them on their anniversary 
or kids who have done well, and the 
Girl Scouts, 4–H clubs, sports teams. I 
guess we recently honored Tom Brady 
for his great football success. That is 
what we do. Every day, somebody is 
coming here and congratulating some-
body else, and that is fine. I do the 
same. In fact, we just congratulated 
some great Olympians from Vermont. 
But maybe the time is approaching 
when we should offer a unanimous res-
olution congratulating the billionaire 
class for their enormous success in 
moving this country into the oligar-
chic form of society that they have 
long desired. Maybe we should do a UC 
on that issue. 
By the way, here is another area of 
congratulations 
to 
the 
billionaire 
class. When we speak about oligarchy— 
when we speak about oligarchy—we 
should all understand that we are not 
just talking about massive levels of in-
come and wealth inequality. We are 
not just talking about the rich getting 
richer and the poor getting poorer. We 
should all understand that never before 
in American history have so few owned 
so much. 
This issue, the issue of the incredible 
concentration of ownership in our 
country, is almost never talked about 
here in Congress or in the corporate 
media, and that has a lot to do with 
the corrupt political system that we 
operate under where many Members of 
Congress receive huge campaign con-
tributions from these very same peo-
ple. 
But here is an important point to 
make, and tomorrow, actually, I will 
be doing a hearing on this as chairman 
of the Budget Committee. This is an 
issue we almost never discuss, and it is 
of enormous consequence. 
Today in America, just three Wall 
Street firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, 
and State Street—I suspect that many 
Americans have never even heard of 
these 
firms—BlackRock, 
Vanguard, 
and State Street, three firms, manage 
over $21 trillion in assets—$21 trillion 
in assets. What does that mean? Well, 
for starters, it means that the amount 
of money these one, two, three firms 
control is more than the gross domes-
tic product, the GDP, of the United 
States of America, the largest economy 
in the world, and more than five times 
the GDP of Germany. 
These three firms, BlackRock, Van-
guard, and State Street, are major 
shareholders in more than 96 percent of 
S&P 500 companies. What does that 
mean? It means that they have signifi-
cant influence over many hundreds of 
companies that employ millions of 
American workers. 
Now, it used to be, way back when, 
there was a company, Company X, 
owned by somebody—nice guy, not a 
nice guy, good employer, bad employer. 
There was a person or a group of people 
who owned a company. That is rapidly 
changing in the oligarchic world that 
we are living in where a handful of 
Wall Street companies have major con-
trol over hundreds and hundreds of 
companies. 
You know, after the Wall Street 
crash of 2008, I recall a lot of discussion 
about the wealth and the power of the 
big banks, the giant banks, and wheth-
er or not they were too big to fail. 
There was a huge amount of discussion. 
Well, today, these three firms, three 
Wall Street firms, are the largest 
shareholders in some of the biggest 
banks in America: JPMorgan Chase, 
Wells Fargo, and Citibank. In other 
words, these banks are also owned by a 
handful of Wall Street firms. 
What 
about 
transportation? 
You 
know, we all get on planes and go here

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S737 
February 16, 2022 
and there. Well, these three major Wall 
Street firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, 
and State Street, are among the top 
owners of the four major airlines— 
United, American, et cetera. 
Well, what about healthcare? What 
about 
healthcare? 
Who 
owns 
the 
healthcare industry? Well, together, 
these three Wall Street firms own an 
average of 20 percent of the major drug 
companies. They also own many hun-
dreds of nursing homes, hospitals, and 
emergency rooms. 
What about housing? Well, what we 
are seeing is a handful of Wall Street 
firms are now the major owners of 
rental housing in America—at a time, 
by the way, when the cost of housing 
and rents is soaring in this country. 
Maybe, just maybe, if you haven’t 
heard a whole lot about these issues, it 
might have something to do with the 
fact that a handful of Wall Street firms 
control half of the newspapers in Amer-
ica. 
I think there is a reality which 
maybe says it all, and that is, during 
this terrible, terrible pandemic, when 
so many people have died and become 
ill and lost their jobs and missed school 
and suffered all of the isolation this 
pandemic has brought about, 745 bil-
lionaires in America became more than 
$2 trillion richer. That is, to my mind, 
the clearest example of the level of cor-
porate greed we are now experiencing. 
Desperate workers who live paycheck 
to paycheck are forced to go to work. 
They go to work in hospitals. They go 
to work in public transportation. They 
go to work in meatpacking plants. 
They are busdrivers—whatever they 
may be. Thousands of them have died 
on the job while a handful of billion-
aires—745—became more than $2 tril-
lion richer. 
When we talk about the growth of ol-
igarchy in America—I talk about it; 
not a whole lot of other people here 
do—when we talk about oligarchy in 
America, it is not just that the very 
rich are getting much richer. That is 
one thing. But the reality is that tens 
of millions of working-class people, 
lower income people, in the wealthiest 
country on Earth are suffering today 
under incredible economic hardship, 
desperately trying day to day to sur-
vive, and 745 billionaires in the pan-
demic—$2 trillion increase in their 
wealth, and tens of millions of Ameri-
cans are struggling hard just to sur-
vive. 
Today, nearly 40 million Americans 
live in poverty; and tonight, almost 
600,000 people will be sleeping out on 
the streets or in homeless shelters. 
They have no apartments, no places in 
which to live. 
And here is an important fact to re-
member: In our country today, the av-
erage worker is making $42 a week less 
than he or she made 49 years ago. In 
other words, when you try to appre-
ciate the anger that exists in this 
country, the discontent, it has a lot to 
do with the fact that the average 
American worker is worse off in terms 
of real inflation weekly income than 
was the case 49 years ago. 
Now, think about that. Think about 
how crazy that is. Think about all of 
the increase in technology and produc-
tivity that we have seen, where work-
ers today are producing a lot more 
than they used to because of the new 
technology, and yet, because of the 
huge transfer of wealth and income, 
they are worse off than they were in 
1973. 
Half of the people in our country 
today are living paycheck to paycheck, 
and tens of millions are an accident, a 
divorce, an illness, or a layoff away 
from economic devastation. 
In America today, we remain the 
only major country on Earth not to 
guarantee healthcare as a right. The 
result of that is we have a system in 
which over 80 million Americans are 
uninsured or underinsured and tens of 
thousands die each and every year be-
cause they don’t get to a doctor when 
they should. 
While many public schools through-
out our country lack the resources to 
adequately educate our young people 
or pay their teachers the wages those 
teachers deserve, at the same time, we 
are the most heavily incarcerated Na-
tion on Earth. We have got more people 
in jail than any other country. 
Meanwhile, 45 million Americans who 
did go to college—they saved up; they 
went to college—they are now drown-
ing in $1.8 trillion in student debt. I 
talk to those nurses and workers every 
day who say: Bernie, we have got to do 
something because every month I am 
paying hundreds and hundreds of dol-
lars in student debt. 
And here is something else that we 
don’t talk about—you know, we have a 
habit here, I am afraid, in the Senate 
and the House; we talk about a lot, but 
often not the most important things in 
the country—and that is that I suspect 
that, as part of human nature, every 
person in America and around the 
world would like to live long and happy 
and productive lives. That is pretty 
basic human nature. But in America 
today, the very richest people live, on 
average, 15 years longer than the poor-
est Americans. 
So when you talk about income and 
wealth inequality, it is not just about 
this guy has a nice house, this person 
doesn’t have a nice house; big car, no 
car. That is one thing. If you are poor 
in America, you are dying at a signifi-
cantly younger age than if you are 
wealthy. 
The polls seem to show that more 
and more Americans are giving up on 
democracy. They work long hours for 
low wages. They worry about their 
kids. They can’t afford healthcare. 
They see their jobs going to other 
countries. Meanwhile, the people on 
top are doing better than any time in 
American history, and they wonder: 
Hey, if we elect these guys to the 
House and the Senate, Governors, what 
are they doing for us? Do they under-
stand? Do they live in the real world? 
Do they understand what is going on in 
our lives, or are they too busy going 
out and raising campaign contributions 
from the rich and the powerful? 
I believe that the time is long, long, 
long overdue for the Congress to start 
addressing the needs of the American 
people. And I know it is a radical idea 
to suggest that maybe, just maybe, we 
should do what the American people 
want and not what wealthy campaign 
contributors want. 
When 83 percent of the American peo-
ple want us to lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs—do you know what, it 
might be time for the Senate to do 
that. 
When 84 percent of the American peo-
ple know there is something wrong 
with elderly people who can’t afford 
dental care, hearing aids, or eye-
glasses—84 
percent—maybe, 
just 
maybe, we may want to expand Medi-
care to cover those basic healthcare 
needs. 
When overwhelming numbers of the 
American people know that it is be-
yond absurd that some billionaires and 
large profitable corporations don’t pay 
a nickel in Federal income tax, maybe, 
just maybe, we might want to change 
our tax system so that the rich and the 
powerful start paying their fair share 
of taxes. 
When 76 percent of the American peo-
ple 
understand 
that 
our 
home 
healthcare system is a disaster, that 
many elderly people and disabled peo-
ple would rather stay home rather than 
be forced into a nursing home, maybe 
we should expand home healthcare. 
When we remain the only major 
country on Earth not to have paid fam-
ily and medical leave—the only major 
country on Earth—maybe it is time 
that the Congress pass a paid family 
and medical leave act. 
When 
we 
have 
a 
dysfunctional 
childcare system in which in my State, 
not 
different 
around 
the 
country, 
working parents are paying 25 percent, 
30 percent of their income for childcare 
so they can go to work, maybe we 
should reform our childcare and pre-K 
system so that it is affordable for all 
parents in this country. 
And maybe—I know this is another 
radical idea. There is a piece in the 
paper today about the impact of cli-
mate change. The sea level is going to 
rise by a foot in the next few decades. 
We are looking at drought, floods, ex-
treme weather disturbances. Here is a 
really radical idea: Maybe, at a time 
when the scientists tell us that it is 
questionable in terms of the kind of 
planet we are going to leave our kids 
and future generations, whether or not 
it is going to be habitable or livable, I 
know it is a radical idea—a lot of fossil 
fuel money coming into this place—but 
maybe, just maybe, we stand up to the 
fossil fuel industry and tell them their 
short-term profits are not more impor-
tant that the future of this planet. 
So we have a lot of work to do. I am 
not sure that we will do it. I am not 
sure that Members of Congress have

the willingness or the courage to stand 
up to the powerful special interests 
who control the economic and political 
life of this country. 
But this, I will say: If we do not do 
that in terms of the economy, in terms 
of climate, in terms of healthcare, in 
terms of education, future generations 
will look back at this Congress and 
say, Where were you? 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Wyoming. 
ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to specifically 
talk about Americans’ need for more 
American energy. 
For the last year, the American peo-
ple have been suffering from ongoing 
Joe Biden inflation. They are paying 
the price, they are feeling the pain, and 
it all started on day 1 of the Biden ad-
ministration, when he took out his Ex-
ecutive order pen, and he killed a pipe-
line bringing energy from Canada to 
the United States. 
And as this war on American energy 
has continued, we are now at a point 
where inflation is the worst it has been 
in 40 years. So it is no surprise that the 
President’s 
approval 
rating 
has 
dropped to a low of only 40 percent in 
America. 
Well, this incredible rise in prices for 
energy, as well as all of the other com-
ponents—whether it is gas, whether it 
is groceries—but if energy gets more 
expensive, we know that it costs more 
to manufacture things, it costs more to 
grow things, it costs more to transport 
things from where they are grown or 
manufactured to market. 
So much of this inflation has been 
brought on as a result of the Joe Biden 
policies related specifically to Amer-
ican energy. 
When you look at the laws that he 
has promoted, the executive actions 
that he has taken from day 1, going all 
the way up to a speech he gave just 
yesterday, this is a President who is 
dancing to the tune of the climate 
elitists and wants to keep American 
energy in the ground. 
Energy prices are up overall about 30 
cents on the dollar since Joe Biden 
took over. They have gone up 8 months 
in a row. Gasoline prices are up by 
about a dollar a gallon, if not more so, 
since Biden took office. 
I was at a high school in Greybull, 
WY, and started talking about energy 
prices. I asked if they know what the 
cost of a gallon of gasoline was, and 
the student body knew to within nine- 
tenths of a penny how much the cost of 
gasoline was in their hometown of 
Greybull, WY. 
You can see it right up there, and 
people know the price, and they have 
been watching, since Joe Biden took 
over, the price of energy going up; and 
we have also seen Joe Biden’s approval 
going down. 
This isn’t a coincidence. This is a di-
rect result of the anti-American energy 
policies of this President and the 
Democrats in this body and this admin-
istration. 
On his first day in office, his very 
first day in office, Joe Biden killed the 
Keystone Pipeline. He blocked new oil 
and gas leases on public lands. He has 
gone after energy exploration in Alas-
ka. 
And for the senior Senator from 
Alaska to come to the floor and go to 
an Energy Committee and say: It is 
hard to believe, but we are using more 
energy in the United States today, she 
said, from Russia than we are from 
Alaska, that is a result of the actions 
of this administration. 
So what has happened with all of 
this? What has the impact been to 
American families? 
Well, they are struggling. They are 
suffering. They are having to change 
the way they drive, the way they eat, 
the way they live. People can’t keep 
up. Wages aren’t keeping up with costs. 
They are just not. People’s dreams are 
being crushed because they have to 
take the savings that they have been 
saving for different items they wanted 
to do and they have to use it to just get 
by, where it costs about $275 a month 
now, this year, to just get by compared 
to last year. Just to maintain a stand-
ard of living, people are having to pay 
$275 more each and every month, just 
to maintain and not to get ahead. 
Apparently, according to the major-
ity leader, the Democrats finally—fi-
nally—yesterday at their lunch were 
going to talk about inflation. It is now 
February of 2022; Joe Biden came into 
office January of 2021. He said inflation 
was going to be temporary. A month, 
he said, after month after month after 
month, and now 10 months into a very 
serious situation, we still don’t hear 
any practical solutions coming from 
the Democrats. We do hear gimmicks. 
We do hear gimmicks. 
Joe Biden, in September, had his Na-
tional Security Advisor, unbelievably, 
beg 
OPEC 
and 
Russia—Russia—to 
produce more oil. We are using twice 
the amount of crude oil now from Rus-
sia than we were a year ago. Vladimir 
Putin, who may any day—even this 
day—invade Ukraine, is still exporting 
5 million barrels of crude oil a day. The 
price of oil is $90 a barrel, probably 
going to $100. The Biden and Demo-
cratic policies have been a jackpot for 
Vladimir Putin. 
So, in November, after he tried the 
effort to beg Putin to produce more en-
ergy and sell it to the United States, 
the President went to another trick in 
his bag of tricks—another gimmick— 
and he said: Let’s release some energy 
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
So he said how much he was going to 
release. The Secretary of Energy was 
asked in a press conference: Well, how 
much is that relative to how much we 
use in the United States? She didn’t 
have any idea. Turned out it was 21⁄2 
days’ worth, and the impact of the re-
lease dropped the price by 2 cents a gal-
lon—2 cents. 
Oh, Democrats patted themselves on 
the back, and then prices went up 
again—a complete failure. 
Now prices are expected to go even 
higher, as I said—maybe $100 a barrel 
soon. Many experts are predicting $4 a 
gallon when you go to fill up this sum-
mer. And now we hear another gim-
mick coming from the Democrats. 
This time it is a temporary pause in 
the gasoline tax until after election 
day. So the New York Times had a 
story about it today: ‘‘Democrats, With 
Eye on Midterms, Search for Ways to 
Bring Down Rising Prices.’’ 
It is not because Americans are suf-
fering, not because people at home, if 
the Democrats ever go home, are tell-
ing them how hard it is, not because 
they have an understanding of the 
needs of the American people—nope, 
none of those reasons. The Democrats, 
with an eye on the midterms, have in-
troduced this legislation. When you 
look at the cosponsors, it is interesting 
that so many of them are people who 
are listed as ‘‘vulnerable’’ come the 
elections in November. This might be 
the gimmick to end all gimmicks. Sus-
pending the gas tax—and, oh, by the 
way, bringing it back right after the 
election. It is all election-driven. 
Are we going to need less energy 
after election day? Is there going to be 
more expensive energy after election 
day? That is what we get. 
I found it interesting to see one Dem-
ocrat stand up and comment on this. It 
is Larry Summers. He was an economic 
adviser and Secretary, Cabinet Mem-
ber, worked with both the Clinton and 
Obama administrations. What did he 
call 
it? 
‘‘Short-sighted, 
ineffective, 
goofy, and gimmicky.’’ 
Thank you, Larry Summers, for 
pointing out to the Democrats in this 
body what the American people already 
see—your efforts are ‘‘short-sighted, 
ineffective, goofy, and gimmicky.’’ 
Of course, the gas tax is the way that 
we pay in this country for roads and 
bridges. If the gas tax went away 
today, the American people and those 
kids in high school and grade school 
who can do the math, who know that 
the gas tax is 18 cents a gallon—Fed-
eral gas tax—knows that the increase 
in the cost of gasoline to what they are 
paying at the pump is still about $1 a 
gallon higher today than it was when 
Joe Biden became President of the 
United States. 
This newest proposal by the Demo-
crats is not about affordable energy; it 
is a cheap political trick. It might 
sound good in a press release. The kids 
in Greybull, WY, know it is not going 
to help them. 
Democrats desperately want to look 
like they are trying to do something 
after ignoring inflation, denying it was 
even there in the first place. Yet, after 
months and months and months of the 
American people suffering, the Amer-
ican people know a gimmick when they 
see it. So Democrats have tried to 
spend 5 months passing their billion- 
dollar reckless tax-and-spending bill. 
The President calls it Build Back Bet-
ter. That is what he called it yesterday 
when he gave a speech to a number of

county commissioners. The bill in-
cludes electric vehicles so that they 
get subsidized. Of course, electric vehi-
cles pay no gas tax because they don’t 
use gas; they use electricity. So they 
don’t subsidize in any way or pay to 
use the roads for the wear and tear on 
the roads that they drive. Yet the 
Democrats are calling for billions and 
billions of dollars of subsidies for those 
drivers. Nearly every Democrat in this 
body still supports this taxpayer give-
away. 
Nearly every Democrat in the Senate 
still supports Joe Biden’s war on Amer-
ican energy. Well, the war on American 
energy is raising the cost to American 
consumers. 
As I said, if we are going to take 18 
cents off the cost of a gallon of gas 
when it is already up a dollar a gallon 
or more, and by summer will be a lot 
higher than that, it is like putting a 
bandaid on a bullet hole. And Joe 
Biden, once again, yesterday, talked to 
these 
county 
commissioners, 
pro-
moting his so-called Build Back Better 
plan, which includes the Green New 
Deal, which is increased taxes on 
American energy, increased regula-
tions on American energy, increased 
penalties on producing American en-
ergy. The American people get the fact 
that will raise the costs for them to 
drive their car, to heat their home, to 
grow crops, to get items to market— 
where shelves are still bare, and they 
were this past weekend at the grocery 
store in Casper, WY. 
Democrats still are delighted that we 
ended the Keystone XL Pipeline. The 
Secretary of Energy was supposed to 
come out with a report about how 
many jobs were lost by that. Well, still 
waiting for the report. Homework is 
past due. 
Will we ever see the report from the 
Secretary of Energy who doesn’t want 
to point out this specific impact that 
Joe Biden has had on this country in 
terms of killing jobs and raising energy 
prices? 
The American people see through all 
of this. That is why only 3 in 10 Ameri-
cans today support the President of the 
United States on what he is doing 
about inflation. That means that just 
about every Republican and every Inde-
pendent and a whole lot of Democrats 
don’t like the fact that Joe Biden is ig-
noring them, refusing to focus on the 
issues that are important to them and 
their lives and their families and their 
future; that their dreams are being sto-
len and ripped from them; that they 
have been using savings that they 
wanted to use for things they had been 
planning for years. And what we see is 
another gimmick coming from the 
Democrats only because their eyes are 
on the midterms. Their eyes ought to 
be on the people at home who sent 
them here in the first place. 
There is a solution to the high cost of 
American 
energy, 
and 
that 
is 
to 
produce more American energy. Let us 
make it here. We have it. Oh, we have 
it in abundance. We have it in Wyo-
ming. We have it all across the coun-
try. Produce American energy. Use 
American energy. 
Vladimir Putin knows how to use en-
ergy. He uses it as a weapon, and he is 
using it as a weapon right now, holding 
Europe hostage. Germany has fallen 
into his trap with Nord Stream 2. He 
knows how to use energy. We have been 
in the United States an energy super-
power. We are. We have the capacity to 
do it. We have gone from energy de-
pendence to energy independence, to 
energy dominance. We need to return 
to the day when we are using American 
energy. 
We are much better as a country and 
safer as a country and stronger as a 
country if we sell energy from the 
United States to our friends rather 
than follow the Joe Biden route of beg-
ging Vladimir Putin to sell some of his 
energy to us. That weakens America. It 
weakens us. It weakens our future. 
We have the resources here in Amer-
ica. We have the know-how. We have 
the individuals wanting to work pro-
ducing American energy. We need an 
administration which will allow us to 
do so, and we don’t have one with the 
leadership in the White House and with 
the majority party in the House and 
the Senate right now. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak about the critical 
role played by U.S. attorneys and U.S. 
marshals in keeping America safe. 
Law enforcement is a team effort, 
and we need officials at the Federal, 
State, and local levels working to-
gether to stop crime in this country 
and to keep people safe in their homes 
and in their neighborhoods. 
It was only 2 months ago when I 
came to the floor of this Senate to re-
quest unanimous consent for the Sen-
ate to take up and confirm five U.S. at-
torney nominations. Despite the out-
standing credentials of all of these 
nominees, one Senator, the junior Sen-
ator from Arkansas, refused to allow 
the Senate to confirm five nominees 
for U.S. attorney positions by a voice 
vote—a tradition in the Senate. That 
Senator’s objections had nothing to do 
with the nominees. He said so. They 
had nothing to do with their records 
and had nothing to do with their quali-
fications. 
Well, after he was confronted on the 
floor of the Senate, he lifted his objec-
tions. We were able to get those U.S. 
attorneys confirmed and put them to 
work, and there is work to be done in 
every State in the Union to make this 
a safer nation. 
We believe in law enforcement—we 
believe in it at every level—and when 
there is delay in putting professionals 
in place, that delay can cost lives. If 
you stand up and say ‘‘I don’t want to 
defund the police’’ but then refuse to 
fill vacancies when it comes to law en-
forcement, that is inconsistent. 
Sadly, we find ourselves in the same 
position today, 2 months later, with 
the same Senator from Arkansas. He is 
again objecting to the swift confirma-
tion of U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal 
nominations. In short, this same Sen-
ator is making it increasingly difficult 
for us to prosecute violent criminals, 
track 
down 
fugitives, 
and 
protect 
Americans 
from 
gang 
violence, 
cybercrime, terrorism, and fraud. 
It is worth taking a moment to con-
sider what U.S. attorneys and U.S. 
marshals do. The positions that they 
hold are nearly as old as the Nation 
itself. Both U.S. marshal and U.S. at-
torney positions were created by the 
Judiciary Act of 1789, passed by the 
First Congress, and signed into law by 
President George Washington. 
The 
specific 
responsibilities 
have 
changed over time, but the core func-
tion is the same. This is the Federal 
answer to enforcing the law, pros-
ecuting crimes, and protecting our 
communities. 
U.S. 
attorneys 
are 
charged with prosecuting all Federal 
criminal offenses. U.S. marshals have 
the responsibility of risking their lives 
to protect Federal judges and court-
houses, tracking down fugitives, and 
assisting in locating and recovering 
missing children, just to mention a 
few. In short, U.S. attorneys and U.S. 
marshals play a critical role in enforc-
ing the law, promoting public safety, 
and protecting our communities. 
So it is sad that this same junior 
Senator from Arkansas is blocking the 
confirmations of six U.S. attorneys and 
two U.S. marshals today. Doing so 
threatens public safety across America 
and puts millions of Americans at risk, 
including the most vulnerable. 
Despite all of the tough talk we hear 
from many of these Senators on the 
other side of the aisle about their dedi-
cation to law and order and keeping 
America safe, it is a Republican Sen-
ator who refuses to take up and con-
firm these nominations in an expedi-
tious way. 
Before I ask for consent for the Sen-
ate to confirm the nominees, I would 
like to yield to the majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank the majority whip. 
Thank you for your good work as 
chair of the Judiciary and for your talk 
on this issue. 
I thank my colleague from Min-
nesota, who has been passionate about 
getting this done as well. 
I rise today to join with my Demo-
cratic colleagues in support of these 
U.S. attorneys and marshals who have 
singlehandedly been delayed for weeks 
by one Senator, the junior Senator 
from Arkansas. 
For 
decades—decades—Democrats 
and Republicans have regularly cooper-
ated to swiftly confirm the many, 
many individuals selected by each 
President to serve in their administra-
tion. Regardless of the party in the 
White House, both sides have long 
agreed that a President deserves to 
have his or her administration in place

quickly. That doesn’t mean we don’t 
disagree, but it does mean that when 
nominees are held up, opposed, or 
blocked, it is for a legitimate purpose, 
not for leverage and partisan games to 
score political points at the expense of 
public safety. Most of us still believe in 
that principle but, sadly, not all of us. 
On the other side of the aisle, a small 
group of obstructionist Republicans 
has spent the last year hijacking the 
rules of the Senate to place an unprece-
dented number of holds on hundreds— 
hundreds—of Presidential appointees. 
Let me repeat. This isn’t about a few 
nominees here and there; we are talk-
ing about hundreds of nominees. 
In this case, my colleague from Ar-
kansas is holding back six U.S. attor-
neys and two U.S. marshals—vital 
roles in preserving public safety. The 
level of partisan obstruction is a new 
low for the Senate. 
When President Trump was in office, 
every single U.S. attorney and U.S. 
marshal—every single one—was con-
firmed by this Chamber with unani-
mous consent. Yes, we had deep, deep 
problems with the Trump Department 
of Justice, but never did we demand a 
rollcall vote just to confirm nominees 
like these. In fact, the last time the 
Senate had to hold a rollcall vote—lis-
ten to this—the last time the Senate 
had to hold a rollcall vote to confirm a 
U.S. attorney was a half a century 
ago—nearly half a century ago—in 1975, 
and it is not hard to see why. U.S. at-
torneys and marshals aren’t political 
positions. Their job is literally to keep 
Americans safe. They are Federal pros-
ecutors, and they are Federal law en-
forcement. 
If my Republican colleagues on the 
other side truly care about public safe-
ty, why are they obstructing the ap-
pointments of individuals whose jobs 
would precisely be to maintain public 
safety in the first place? It is ‘‘Alice in 
Wonderland’’ logic. 
Now, this isn’t just about breaking 
precedent. Right now, communities 
across the country still don’t have 
their U.S. attorneys on the job because 
of obstruction here in the Senate. Dis-
tricts in Georgia, Ohio, Nevada, Min-
nesota, Michigan, and Illinois are all 
still waiting for U.S. attorneys. 
Sadly, the families who live in these 
communities shouldn’t have to pay the 
price for what a very small number of 
Republicans are doing here, but, sadly, 
that is what is happening. It is a text-
book example of why Americans are 
frustrated with the Senate and are 
frustrated with their government. 
On the other hand, I want to thank 
my Democratic colleagues for advo-
cating on behalf of the U.S. attorneys 
and marshals. I thank my friend Sen-
ator DURBIN, chairman of the Judici-
ary, for speaking passionately. I thank 
Senator KLOBUCHAR for coming to the 
floor to speak. I thank Senators ROSEN 
and CORTEZ MASTO and DUCKWORTH and 
BROWN, who have also spoken. 
One way or another, these nominees 
will be confirmed by the Senate. Re-
publican obstructionists can try to 
delay, but they cannot stop these indi-
viduals from ultimately going through. 
If the holds on these nominees are 
not dropped, I will be filing cloture on 
them, and we will schedule votes to ad-
vance them until the job is finished. If 
that means more late nights, then 
more late nights are coming. If it 
means vote series with six or seven or 
eight votes in a row, then that is what 
we will do. 
Most of us don’t want to go down 
that road, and we don’t have to. The 
overwhelming majority of Democrats 
and Republicans want to preserve the 
decades of precedent and comity that 
has enabled us to work together on 
nominees. 
So let me say for one last time, de-
laying the appointment of U.S. attor-
neys and U.S. marshals over cheap par-
tisan games ultimately makes Ameri-
cans less safe and weakens law enforce-
ment. 
I urge my Republican colleague to 
drop his obstruction or else he can ex-
plain to his colleagues why we have to 
schedule a dizzyingly large number of 
rollcall votes just to push these nomi-
nees through. 
I thank my colleagues for their work 
and yield to Senator DURBIN. 
Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority 
leader. I would like to just add: There 
must be those following the debate who 
are wondering, ‘‘What is the basis for 
the junior Senator from Arkansas op-
posing these eight nominees? There 
must be something wrong with them. 
There must be something in their 
background that doesn’t add up.’’ 
Consider the variety of individuals 
who are being held up by the junior 
Senator 
from 
Arkansas: 
Ryan 
Buchanan, of Georgia, to be U.S. attor-
ney for the Northern District; Jason 
Frierson, of Nevada, to be U.S. attor-
ney for the District of Nevada; Andrew 
Luger, of Minnesota, to be U.S. attor-
ney for the District of Minnesota—and 
the Senator from Minnesota will speak 
to that in just a moment—Mark 
Totten, of Michigan, to be U.S. attor-
ney for the Western District of Michi-
gan; Marisa Darden, of Ohio, to be U.S. 
attorney for the Northern District of 
Ohio; Delia Smith, of the Virgin Is-
lands, to be U.S. attorney for the Dis-
trict of the Virgin Islands; Eddie 
Frizell, again of Minnesota, to be U.S. 
marshal for the District of Minnesota; 
and LaDon Reynolds, of Illinois, to be 
U.S. marshal for the Northern District 
of Illinois. 
We looked especially at our own 
nominees very closely to make sure 
that they were qualified to take on 
these Federal positions. Several of my 
colleagues are going to come to the 
floor today to speak about the nomi-
nees being held up by one Senator, so 
rather than delving into the records of 
all of the eight nominees, let me just 
focus on the one in Illinois—Chief 
LaDon Reynolds, nominated to serve as 
U.S. marshal for the Northern District. 
Chief Reynolds has served the people 
of Illinois for nearly 30 years. He joined 
the Oak Park Police Department in 
1994, rising steadily through the ranks 
until his appointment in 2019 as chief. 
In addition to his service at the Oak 
Park Police Department, Chief Rey-
nolds serves on the Illinois Law En-
forcement 
Training 
and 
Standards 
Board, the Illinois Commission on Dis-
crimination and Hate Crimes, and the 
Executive Board of the Illinois Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police. In short, 
Chief Reynolds is eminently qualified 
to serve as U.S. marshal for the North-
ern District of Illinois. There is simply 
no valid basis to delay his confirma-
tion. 
And I have yet to hear the Senator 
from Arkansas come forward with a 
bill of particulars of why he has de-
cided to single out the people whom I 
just mentioned, to deny them an oppor-
tunity to make communities safer 
across America. At a time of high 
crime and the need for a coordinated 
effort at every single level, there is ab-
solutely no valid explanation of why 
these individuals are being withheld 
from their responsibilities in these 
communities. 
We need to have law enforcement 
taken seriously and respected. Holding 
up nominations for no particular rea-
son other than a political issue that 
may bother the Senator is certainly no 
reason for us to jeopardize the safety of 
innocent people living in these commu-
nities who depend on these Federal law 
enforcement officials to do their job. 
At this point, I would like to make a 
unanimous consent request. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of the following nomina-
tions en bloc: Calendar No. 660, 661, 662, 
663, 739, 740, 741, and 742; that the Sen-
ate vote on the nominations en bloc 
without intervening action or debate; 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate; 
that any statement related to the 
nominations be printed in the RECORD 
and that the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, which I 
most certainly will do, I will just ad-
dress what the Senator from Illinois 
said. 
He said he has heard no explanation 
for why I am objecting to every De-
partment of Justice nominee moving 
forward on a fast-track basis. That is 
false. He has heard my explanation re-
peatedly. He may not like it, but he 
has heard it. 
I am taking this stance on behalf of 
four brave U.S. marshals who defended 
the Federal courthouse in Portland 
from leftwing street militias associ-
ated with the BLM movement and 
antifa. 
The summer of 2020 was part of riots 
all across our country, but in Portland 
these riots were particularly dan-
gerous. Marshals were targeted with la-
sers to blind them, with ball bearings,

with fireworks. There were efforts to 
barricade them inside the courthouse 
and set it on fire to burn them alive. 
These marshals are heroes, and they 
should be celebrated. Anyone who says 
they support law enforcement should 
be defending these marshals. 
Not surprisingly, leftwing activists 
and leftwing organizations, like the 
ACLU, are coming to the defense of the 
leftwing street militia that attacked 
these marshals, tried to burn down the 
Portland courthouse, suing marshals 
on frivolous grounds. 
Many of these marshals are being de-
fended by the Department of Justice, 
as is the Department of Justice’s long-
standing custom and practice to either 
provide representation for its law en-
forcement officers when they are sued 
in court or, if there is some conflict, to 
reimburse them and pay their legal 
fees. Four marshals are not being de-
fended, though. 
These four marshals are GS–11s, GS– 
13s. They have been serving our coun-
try for a lifetime. Many of them are 
veterans, veterans of foreign wars. 
They face financial bankruptcy and 
ruin because the Department of Justice 
won’t represent them; in many cases, 
won’t even give them an answer or ex-
plain why the representation was de-
nied. 
When I learned of this, I demanded 
answers. And the Department of Jus-
tice had no answers. So if my col-
leagues think that I am going to just 
roll out the red carpet for Department 
of Justice nominees to be confirmed to 
politically connected positions, while 
GS–11s and GS–13s are hung out to dry, 
they have another thing coming. 
Now, some of you may say: Well, 
maybe there are investigations under-
way. Maybe these officers engaged in 
misconduct. We don’t know. They 
won’t give us answers. But here is what 
we do know: All four of them—all 
four—are currently on unrestricted Ac-
tive Duty—unrestricted Active Duty. 
And I would add, all four—all four— 
are in the Special Operations Group for 
the Marshals Service, which means to 
say they are the marshals who are 
most likely to be deployed nationwide 
and put in circumstances that risk 
their lives and call for them to use vio-
lence, to include lethal violence. 
Now, I don’t know the circumstances 
that led to the denial of representation 
of these four marshals or why some of 
them are being strung along, but I have 
to assume—I have to assume—that if 
they are on unrestricted Active Duty 
in the Special Operations Group of the 
Marshals Service, that Merrick Gar-
land and Vanita Gupta can’t have any 
doubts about their fitness to serve or 
their actions for all those weeks in 
Portland 
when 
they 
defended 
the 
courthouse from leftwing street mili-
tias. 
I understand my colleagues want to 
get their U.S. attorneys or their U.S. 
marshals confirmed. Maybe there are 
people at Main Justice they want to 
get confirmed as well. That is very 
simple. We could do it today. We could 
hear from Merrick Garland or Vanita 
Gupta that they will defend these four 
U.S. marshals in court or we could hear 
a satisfactory answer of why they 
won’t defend the marshals in court. 
Is it because they were standing up 
to a leftwing street militia? Is it be-
cause they were taking a stance to de-
fend Federal property from antifa? I 
don’t know. We can’t get an answer. 
Maybe my Democratic colleagues could 
get an answer. 
But to think that I am just going to 
roll over and allow the Senate to fast- 
track nominees to the Department, 
when GS–11s and GS–13s, law enforce-
ment officials, are being hung up to 
dry—sorry. 
These are people—and I have talked 
to them—who were worried about buy-
ing Christmas gifts for their children 
last year because they had to pay legal 
fees, who are worried about paying the 
mortgage next month, who are worried 
about sending their kids to camp. 
Sorry if your lawyers have to wait for 
a week or two to get confirmed to the 
U.S. attorney’s position. I am worried 
about four heroes who defended Federal 
property from leftwing street militias. 
So, yes, I do object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Objection is heard. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, try 
to follow that logic, if you will. The 
Senator is so committed to law en-
forcement, he is so committed to U.S. 
marshals, he won’t let us appoint peo-
ple to fill vacancies. 
He takes the case in Portland, OR, 
where he wrote a letter to the Depart-
ment of Justice within the last 2 weeks 
asking for the status of their defense of 
these 74 individuals. Now, he knows, 
and we all know, that before we can 
take any action for anybody, we need a 
confidentiality waiver, a privacy state-
ment. That is routine in all of our of-
fices. 
Each one of these individuals, despite 
the interest of the junior Senator from 
Arkansas, has their own legal right to 
determine whether or not they want to 
waive any privacy so that they can tell 
the public or discuss even with the 
Senator their plight and how they want 
to address it. 
There is also something called the at-
torney-client privilege, which the Sen-
ator, I am sure, is aware of. That, too, 
is a privilege which allows the indi-
vidual to deny ordinary access to infor-
mation if they so choose. It is their de-
cision. 
So the complication of the situation 
is ignored by the Senator from Arkan-
sas. He is valiantly standing for U.S. 
marshals that he won’t appoint. He be-
lieves they are important and that 
they give their lives to their country— 
and many have—and yet he won’t let 
them stand up and do that on behalf of 
our communities. 
He wants an answer to his letter, and 
until he gets an answer to his letter, 
then we are not going to be able to put 
law enforcement in place to deal with 
crime in this country. We can make all 
the statements, run all the ads, make 
all the speeches on the floor about a 
concern for safety in our communities, 
and then the junior Senator from Ar-
kansas says, ‘‘I want you to be safe in 
your community, but you can’t have a 
U.S. 
attorney 
to 
prosecute 
those 
would-be terrorists. You can’t have a 
U.S. marshal for pursuit of fugitives 
from justice. You can’t have a U.S. 
marshal to protect the courthouse for 
men and women who go to work there 
every day and risk their lives for the 
administration of justice.’’ 
This is upside down. We are talking 
about 74 individuals. The Department 
of Justice has said they are going to 
defend 70 of them. One is a question, I 
assume, whether he was acting in the 
scope of his employment, and three are 
under review. And for that reason, this 
Senator has decided to stop the admin-
istration of justice in these jurisdic-
tions or at least slow it down. That 
makes no sense whatsoever. 
The basis for objecting to these indi-
viduals has nothing to do with their in-
dividual qualifications. He didn’t raise 
a single question. All he said is, ‘‘Your 
lawyers are going to have to wait,’’ as 
if these were just lawyers waiting for a 
fee. 
These are men and women willing to 
serve, as he serves, in public service. It 
is more than just lawyers—not that 
there is anything wrong with that cat-
egory of Americans—but it is individ-
uals who are willing to engage in pub-
lic service. 
And why are we in such a hurry? We 
are in the second year of this Presi-
dent’s administration. It is time to fill 
these vacancies. 
As Senator SCHUMER said earlier on 
the floor, there are several on the Re-
publican side who just want to drag 
this out interminably in the hopes that 
they can stop the Biden administration 
from filling these vacancies. 
My colleague from Arkansas asked 
whether the DOJ is representing Fed-
eral law enforcement personnel who 
protected the Federal courthouse in 
Portland. The FOX News headline 
about his letter said: ‘‘Cotton places 
hold on DOJ nominees after refusal to 
defend US Marshals involved in Port-
land Antifa riots.’’ 
Here is the reality. The Department 
of Justice often represents or pays pri-
vate counsel to represent Federal em-
ployees sued in their individual capac-
ity, but there are some constraints, 
and I have mentioned them. For exam-
ple, regulations require that the De-
partment of Justice can only represent 
employees for actions within the scope 
of their employment; for example, pro-
tecting the Portland courthouse, which 
clearly is within the scope. And the De-
partment of Justice can only represent 
them if doing so would be in the inter-
est of the United States. It clearly 
would be if they are defending against 
terrorists. 
The Senator knows this. Do you 
know why he knows it? Because the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S742 
February 16, 2022 
Department of Justice responded to his 
letter. He just didn’t like the re-
sponse—it didn’t go far enough. 
The Department said, ‘‘The Depart-
ment of Justice strongly supports the 
provision of representation to federal 
officers acting in the line of duty.’’ The 
Department also told him that it rep-
resents or has paid for private counsel 
to represent 70 of these employees who 
have been sued in connection with the 
events in Portland, while denying only 
a single request for representation. 
I don’t know the facts of that denial. 
I don’t know if there has been a pri-
vacy waiver signed. I don’t know if this 
individual said, ‘‘I have an attorney- 
client privilege, and I don’t have to tell 
the Senator from Arkansas or anyone 
what the circumstances are.’’ The Sen-
ator from Arkansas is now demanding 
to know why the Department of Jus-
tice denied this one request for rep-
resentation and why it is still review-
ing three others. That is right—he is 
blocking the confirmation of critical 
law enforcement officials across the 
United States until he gets an answer 
that he likes. 
The DOJ has already explained that 
it cannot comment further—here is 
what they said—‘‘in light of significant 
confidentiality interests and applicable 
privileges.’’ As I mentioned earlier the 
privacy laws and attorney-client privi-
lege. 
‘‘DOJ’s regulations make it clear 
that communication about an employ-
ee’s requests for representation are 
protected by the attorney-client privi-
lege, and the Privacy Act prevents DOJ 
from disclosing the personnel record of 
an employee,’’ and that is as it should 
be. 
Let me be clear. These privileges pro-
tect the privacy of the very law en-
forcement personnel whose interests 
the Senator from Arkansas claims to 
represent. 
My Republican colleagues frequently 
claim to be the party of law and order, 
but in this matter and others, they are 
the ones playing politics with law en-
forcement because the Department of 
Justice will not snap to the Senator’s 
request and violate standing Federal 
laws; because they won’t ignore and 
violate those laws of privacy and attor-
ney-client privilege, he is prepared to 
endanger the communities and law en-
forcement until he gets his way. 
I have heard my Republican col-
leagues time and again claiming that 
the Biden administration and Demo-
cratic mayors in big cities are respon-
sible for violent crime. They claim 
that the increase in violent crime has 
nothing to do with the fact that Amer-
ica is awash in guns, that the reality is 
that the increase in violent crime 
started during the last administration, 
under President Trump. It is affecting 
communities led by both Republican 
and Democratic officials. And it is 
being driven by gun violence. 
FBI statistics show that 77 percent of 
homicides in 2020 were committed with 
guns. In Chicago, that number is high-
er. Ninety-three percent of homicides 
last year in Chicago were committed 
by gun. 
We face a gun violence crisis. The Ju-
diciary Committee held five hearings 
last year on ways to reduce it. I am 
going to continue it this year. But if 
we are going to address this crisis, we 
are going to need Senators from both 
parties to show some courage and to 
admit that gun violence in America is 
a real problem. 
We also need Republicans to stop de-
fending the violent insurrection that 
took place right in this Chamber on 
January 6, 2021. The Senator was 
present. All of us were. We will never 
forget that day as long as we live. Five 
brave police officers lost their lives as 
a result of what the Republican Na-
tional Committee in its official policy 
position calls ‘‘legitimate political dis-
course.’’ 
This is nothing new. Last year, Con-
gress passed the American Rescue 
Plan—$350 billion for State and local 
governments. We made sure that fund-
ing was going to hire good law enforce-
ment officials and invested in commu-
nity violence intervention. Not a single 
Republican Senator approved it. 
There are areas where we are work-
ing together on bipartisan legislation, 
and I hope we will continue to. Last 
year, President Biden signed three laws 
in that area. 
I hope my Republican colleagues will 
take a lesson from today. If we are 
going to stand together, then let us all 
stand behind the Federal law enforce-
ment team. 
When President Trump asked for his 
team, Democrats in the Senate cooper-
ated and gave those people to him. 
They weren’t the people we would have 
chosen, but he was President and had 
the right to do his best to protect this 
Nation. So does President Biden. 
President Biden has called for signifi-
cant increases for our police in the 
Byrne Justice Program and the COPS 
Hiring Program, but this important 
funding has been delayed by debate 
over 
appropriations. 
We 
shouldn’t 
delay the appointment of these key law 
enforcement officials either. 
Again and again, Democrats are 
working to support law enforcement 
and to keep Americans safe. Some-
times we are joined in these efforts by 
Republicans and other times not, but 
there is no benefit to law enforcement 
when Senators block the confirmation 
of well-qualified U.S. attorney and U.S. 
marshal nominees, as we see today. 
I urge the Senator from Arkansas to 
stand up for law enforcement. A polit-
ical story on FOX is not worth under-
mining the lives of innocent Ameri-
cans. We have to end this obstruction 
and let these nominees protect and 
serve. 
I now yield to Senator KLOBUCHAR. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I am 
surprised to hear the Senator from Illi-
nois continue to refer to this as a polit-
ical issue or a political story when we 
have career law enforcement officers 
who put their lives on the line to de-
fend Federal property from leftwing 
street militias. And they are worried if 
they can put the food on the table for 
their children, if they can buy them 
gifts at Christmas, if they can put 
braces on them, if they can send them 
to summer camp. 
I don’t consider that a political issue; 
I consider it standing up for law en-
forcement—not just these four but 
every deputy marshal around the coun-
try who forms the backbone of the 
Marshals Service, the backbone of the 
Marshals Service all across the coun-
try, who have to wonder if maybe they 
are going to be the next one to be hung 
out to dry by the Department of Jus-
tice if they confront a rioter with the 
wrong politics. 
This is not a political issue. 
Now, the Senator from Illinois con-
tinues to speak about confidentiality 
and attorney-client privilege as if this 
is all information that has been com-
municated to these four marshals and 
they just don’t want to share it with us 
here in the Senate. That is not the 
case. Three of them, I would say, 
haven’t heard anything. In a lawsuit 
that is almost 18 months old, they have 
been told nothing yet. That is why 
they have had to go out and retain 
their own counsel. 
One of them was denied representa-
tion with no more basis than saying it 
is not in the interest of the United 
States of America. Well, forgive me if I 
don’t trust Vanita Gupta to determine 
what is in the interest of the United 
States when it comes to defending law 
enforcement. 
These marshals are told that these 
determinations are final and there is 
no appeal and there is no recourse. 
Well, I am the recourse now. 
The Senator from Illinois keeps talk-
ing about these urgent law enforce-
ment needs in his own State of Illinois. 
I would point out that the position 
that is empty has been empty since 
2018. If it was so urgent, the Senator 
from Illinois could have cooperated 
with the Trump administration and 
tried to fill it then. These U.S. attor-
ney positions that are empty—Presi-
dent Biden fired all U.S. attorneys a 
year ago. If it was so urgent to have 
Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys in po-
sition, he could have asked them to 
continue to serve until he was able to 
find suitable replacements. 
The Senator from Illinois also said: 
Well, Senator Cotton got his letter re-
sponded to. I am not looking for some 
courtesy exchange of letters here; I am 
trying to protect four U.S. marshals 
who defended the Portland courthouse 
from a leftwing street militia, who 
have been hung out to dry, imperiling 
the confidence of all marshals across 
the country in whether or not their po-
litical leadership at the Department of 
Justice will back them up when they 
are in a controversy. The Department 
still won’t answer that. They won’t

take any steps to answer it. They sim-
ply hide behind confidentiality and 
privilege just like they are hiding be-
hind it with these four U.S. marshals— 
after 18 months. 
What is so complicated? As the Sen-
ator from Illinois said, they are rep-
resenting 70 others. What makes these 
four so different? Maybe they engaged 
in misconduct. Is that possible given 
the fact that they are all on unre-
stricted active duty in the Special Op-
erations Group, the element of the 
marshals most likely to have to use vi-
olence, to include lethal violence? 
Would Merrick Garland and Vanita 
Gupta really send them back out on 
the streets if they had engaged in mis-
conduct in Portland? 
These marshals deserve better, and 
they could get better if the Depart-
ment of Justice would just agree to 
represent them or if they would give a 
satisfactory, fact-based answer about 
why they are not representing them. 
Maybe some of my Democratic col-
leagues could call Merrick Garland or 
Vanita Gupta and ask them for such an 
answer or maybe just call them and 
say: Why don’t you represent these 
four marshals? That seems like the ob-
vious, satisfactory outcome for every-
one here: U.S. marshals are represented 
in court, as they should be, and we can 
go back to fast-tracking Department of 
Justice nominees. But until we get to 
that outcome, we won’t be fast-track-
ing Department nominees because I 
will continue to stand up for these 
brave men of law enforcement who de-
serve better from this Department of 
Justice. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I rise today in support of the two nomi-
nees from my State: Andy Luger, who 
has been nominated to be the U.S. at-
torney for the District of Minnesota; 
and Eddie Frizell, a veteran, serving 
our country bravely overseas, who has 
been nominated to be the U.S. marshal. 
I was sitting here thinking to myself 
as I listened to Senator COTTON that 
there were a lot of things I disagreed 
with at the Trump Justice Depart-
ment—many, 
many 
things; 
many, 
many things—but never once did I 
think about holding up the U.S. attor-
ney of Arkansas or of Arizona or of Illi-
nois because I disagreed with Donald 
Trump. Why? Because as someone who 
used to be in law enforcement, I under-
stand how important these positions 
are, and I don’t think they should be 
held hostage simply because he hap-
pens to have a disagreement about 
something the Justice Department is 
doing. 
There were so many things that I dis-
agreed with Bill Barr and his associ-
ates about, and not only did I support 
the nominee for Minnesota whom Don-
ald Trump put up for both the marshal 
and the U.S. attorney and voted for 
them, but I actually issued a public 
statement saying that they were quali-
fied. I worked with them, and I talked 
to them ahead of time, and I actually 
liked them, because they might not 
have been, as the Senator from Illinois 
pointed out, my first choice, but there 
was something larger than politics and 
my first choice. My first choice was 
our justice system, our country, and 
the safety of our citizens. 
Right now, in my home State, they 
do not understand why a Senator from 
Arkansas is holding up law enforce-
ment in the State of Minnesota. 
As the chief Federal law enforcement 
officer for their respective districts, 
U.S. attorneys are critical to ensuring 
that American communities are kept 
safe. This role is so vital that the 
Founders created the position during 
the very first Congress as part of the 
Judiciary Act of 1789. This is the same 
act that created the Attorney General 
and the structure of the courts. 
Today, in my State, the U.S. attor-
ney leads a team of nearly 130 dedi-
cated law enforcement professionals, 
including 65 assistant U.S. attorneys. 
The office is responsible for bringing to 
justice those who commit a range of 
Federal crimes, including drug traf-
ficking, 
child 
exploitation, 
cyber 
crimes, and national security matters. 
After 9/11, it was the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office in my home State of Minnesota 
that was involved in what was known 
as the hijacker who got caught. A cit-
izen turned him in, and it was our U.S. 
Attorney’s Office that worked with 
New York on that case. 
It was our U.S. Attorney’s Office that 
took on the second biggest white-collar 
case next to Madoff and won. 
It was our U.S. Attorney’s Office, 
under the nominee who is right now on 
the floor, Andy Luger, that took on 
perhaps the most infamous missing 
children case in the country. I know 
that the Presiding Officer, being from 
the State of Wisconsin, knows this case 
of Jacob Wetterling—sad, tragic case. 
He was able to put together the puzzle 
pieces that had eluded law enforcement 
because of his vast experience working 
as an assistant in the State of New 
York, working in Minnesota in this 
very office as an assistant and working 
his way up. He was able to put together 
that case with local, State, and Federal 
law enforcement and solve it and bring 
some justice and bring some closure for 
the Wetterling family, who will never 
see their son again. That is Andy 
Luger. 
This is a guy who took on a sex traf-
ficking case on his own with a young 
woman trafficked in the city of Roch-
ester and brought the case to trial. 
This is someone who has reached out to 
our communities—our Native Amer-
ican communities—and gotten things 
done. 
And this is someone, based on my 
discussions, Senator COTTON, with the 
Trump White House, that they would 
have actually, after firing all the U.S. 
attorneys, would have had him back. 
He decided to go to the private sector 
for a while, and now he is ready to 
come back. 
So this is someone whom I have got-
ten calls about, since you put this hold 
on all the U.S. attorneys, from Repub-
lican Members of Congress who think 
we need him in place. I have gotten 
calls from Republicans across my State 
who want to put this guy in place. 
We have double jeopardy here for my 
State because you are not only holding 
up, Senator COTTON, the U.S. attorney 
for the State of Minnesota, you are 
also holding up the U.S. marshal. 
Andy Luger, the U.S. attorney nomi-
nee, as I noted, previously led the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Minnesota from 2014 to 2017. His proven 
experience is exactly what is needed to 
handle the challenges facing law en-
forcement in Minnesota today. 
He has been waiting since January 1 
to get this done because he figured this 
went well before the Committee—so he 
is waiting. He is waiting to serve our 
State, as is our U.S. marshal can-
didate. 
In addition to the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice, for over 160 years, the U.S. Mar-
shals Service has helped keep Min-
nesota safe, protecting public servants, 
tracking down and apprehending fugi-
tives, and operating the Witness Pro-
tection Program. 
President Biden’s nominee to serve 
as U.S. marshal for the District of Min-
nesota, as I noted, is Eddie Frizell. 
Chief Frizell was recommended by a se-
lection committee, as was Andy Luger 
that Senator SMITH and I convened. It 
included leaders in Minnesota’s law en-
forcement advocacy and communities. 
Eddie Frizell brings nearly 30 years 
of experience in law enforcement in my 
State, including serving as a chief of 
police for the Metro Transit Police De-
partment. As I noted, he is also a 30- 
year veteran of the Minnesota Army 
National Guard. 
I once met him coming off a plane 
after his deployment. I will never for-
get that moment. As the brave soldiers 
are getting off that plane, I thought, ‘‘I 
know that guy.’’ Yes, I was a Senator 
now. I knew him when he was a police 
officer and I was a county attorney. 
Thirty years, veteran of the Minnesota 
Army National Guard, including two 
overseas deployments—one to Bosnia 
and another to Kuwait and Iraq. 
Throughout his career, he has led by 
example, immersing himself in the 
community and becoming what our 
newspaper called a ‘‘model of persist-
ence.’’ His proven experience is exactly 
what is needed. 
So why haven’t we been able to con-
firm these two nominees, both of whom 
moved through the Judiciary Com-
mittee on a voice vote with broad bi-
partisan support, after I, as I noted, 
proudly supported President Trump’s 
nominees—who, by the way, they went 
into their jobs, and they did their jobs. 
That is how we do law enforcement. 
That is how it is supposed to work. 
This hold has nothing to with the 
qualifications of the nominees for my 
State. Instead, as Senator DURBIN has 
just noted, Senator COTTON has put an

indiscriminate hold on all the Depart-
ment of Justice law enforcement nomi-
nees, stalling appointments for critical 
positions in Illinois, Georgia, Nevada, 
Michigan, Ohio, the Virgin Islands, 
and, yes, my State of Minnesota. And I 
am sure, if he continues this—and as 
Senator SCHUMER
has noted, he is 
going to have to call up votes for posi-
tions that, during the Trump adminis-
tration, went through with consent 
during the Trump administration. 
These nominees in these States are 
ready to serve millions of Americans, 
including 5.7 million people in my 
State who need the leadership of a per-
manent U.S. attorney and U.S. mar-
shal. 
Senator COTTON is seeking informa-
tion from the Department of Justice, 
and I hope that his questions are an-
swered, but I cannot stand by and let 
him use critical law enforcement nomi-
nations as leverage. 
I note—and I will end with this—the 
timetables. During the last administra-
tion, Erica MacDonald—the U.S. attor-
ney I mentioned, former judge who had 
been appointed by Tim Pawlenty— 
whom I met with in my house so I 
could make sure that we moved her 
nomination quickly, she was confirmed 
by the Senate, Senator DURBIN, to be 
U.S. attorney the same day her nomi-
nation was reported by the Judiciary 
Committee on May 24, 2018. 
Tom Heffelfinger was nominated by, 
by the way, two President Bushes—the 
first and the second President Bush. 
When he was nominated by President 
George W. Bush to be U.S. attorney for 
Minnesota, his nomination was re-
ceived by the Senate on September 4, 
2001. He was reported favorably by the 
Judiciary Committee on September 13 
and confirmed by the full Senate the 
next day. His entire confirmation proc-
ess took 10 days. 
And, by the way, when he retired 
from his position, he then served on my 
selection committees—the U.S. attor-
ney who had served under both Presi-
dent Bushes. This is how law enforce-
ment is supposed to work. 
Before him, Todd Jones, who became, 
by the way, the head of the ATF—he 
was nominated by President Bill Clin-
ton to be U.S. attorney for Minnesota. 
His nomination was received in the 
Senate on October 7, 1998. He was re-
ported favorably by the Judiciary Com-
mittee the next day and confirmed by 
the full Senate on October 21, 1998. His 
entire confirmation process took only 
14 days. 
Finally, there was James Rosenbalm, 
who was nominated by President Ron-
ald Reagan to be the U.S. attorney for 
Minnesota. His nomination was re-
ceived by the Senate on October 21, 
1981. He was reported favorably out of 
the Judiciary Committee that day and 
was confirmed by the full Senate that 
day. His entire confirmation process 
happened in 1 day. 
I hope we can get back to this tradi-
tion of cooperation and recognition 
that these law enforcement leaders 
aren’t pawns in a political game. They 
are needed to help keep our commu-
nities 
safe 
and 
deserve 
to 
move 
through the Senate expeditiously. 
We expect sound judgment from Fed-
eral law enforcement. Our constituents 
expect sound judgment when it comes 
to confirming top Federal law enforce-
ment officers for a State. And it is 
time to do the right thing by con-
firming not just Mr. Luger and Mr. 
Frizell but the other law enforcement 
officers who have been held up. And I 
am happy to come back here day after 
day after day until we get this done. 
The people who work in the U.S. At-
torney’s Office, Marshals Office, and 
my constituents deserve to have people 
in place. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in 
the interest of allowing the Senators 
who are wishing to speak an appro-
priate amount of time and within the 
confines of our upcoming vote, I ask 
unanimous consent that there be 40 
minutes, equally divided, between the 
majority and minority; that the major-
ity side be recognized in the order of 
Senators 
ROSEN, 
CORTEZ
MASTO, 
DUCKWORTH, and BROWN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The junior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
feel like we are ships passing in the 
night here. I could go on and on about 
the exploits of these deputy marshals 
when they were Rangers and Green Be-
rets and what they did in combat. But 
my Democratic colleagues aren’t get-
ting the heart of the matter: why they 
are being denied representation for de-
fending the courthouse in Portland. 
So I will direct a question to the Sen-
ator 
from 
Minnesota 
through 
the 
Chair: Does she believe that these four 
U.S. marshals should be represented in 
court like all other marshals are being 
represented? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Being that I am 
the Senator from Minnesota and I am 
not on the staff of the Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States and I have 
nothing to with the State in which this 
happened, I am not aware of all the 
facts of this. And I think it would actu-
ally be inappropriate for me to be in-
volved in Justice Department policy. I 
am here on behalf of the people in my 
State, and I want to get someone in 
place. 
And I have made the case, Senator 
COTTON, that at no time did I not only 
hold up the U.S. attorneys or the mar-
shals under Donald Trump, I actually 
supported the ones in my State. And I 
am just asking for that same courtesy 
for the people of my State. We have 
talked about this before. And I simply 
believe that we should be able to get 
our U.S. attorneys and marshals in 
place. And you can do what you want 
to complain about what is going on in 
the Justice Department, to make your 
case to them, to go on TV about it, to 
make speeches in this Chamber, to 
write letters about it, to advocate, to 
gather your friends who might support 
you on this, but you shouldn’t be hurt-
ing the people of my State while you 
do it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I urge 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle to allow these highly qualified 
Federal law enforcement nominations 
to move forward. 
In my State of Nevada, the position 
of U.S. attorney has been unfilled for 
nearly a year. 
This position, well, it plays a vital 
role in maintaining the rule of law and 
making sure that justice is carried out 
in our State. The continued obstruc-
tion of these critical nominees impacts 
the public safety of Nevadans and im-
pacts their ability to see justice served. 
They have a highly qualified nominee 
to 
serve 
as 
U.S. 
attorney, 
Jason 
Frierson. He is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Nevada, Reno, and the Boyd 
Law School of the University of Ne-
vada, Las Vegas. He is a former Nevada 
Supreme Court clerk. And he served in 
the district attorney’s office as a pub-
lic defender and as a deputy attorney 
general for our great State. 
In addition, Mr. Frierson has a long 
track record of fighting for hard-work-
ing Nevadans as speaker of the Nevada 
Assembly. I know he will lead in his 
role with integrity—integrity and a 
deep commitment to upholding the law 
as a top Federal prosecutor for our 
State. 
There is absolutely no basis to delay 
his nomination and the nominations of 
other U.S. attorneys and marshals 
around the country. Holding up these 
qualified nominees does not help Amer-
icans. It only leaves them unprotected. 
We must rise above partisan politics 
and do our duty to allow these key 
roles to be filled. For all of the people, 
for my State of Nevada, I urge my col-
leagues to allow the nomination of 
Jason Frierson and the other nominees 
in this block to finally move forward. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Madam 
President, 
again, I feel like we are ships passing 
in the night, not getting to the point 
here. So I will address a question to the 
junior Senator through the Chair, 
slightly differently than when I spoke 
to the Senator from Minnesota. 
If officers are returned to unre-
stricted Active Duty on the Special Op-
erations Group, does the Senator be-
lieve that they should be represented 
for past incidents of alleged misuse of 
force? 
Ms. ROSEN. Senator, I will reiterate 
what my colleague from Minnesota 
said. I do not serve on the Judiciary 
Committee, and I do not serve in the 
Department of Justice. Therefore, I am 
not privy to the information that has 
been provided in privacy to the Depart-
ment of Justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S745 
February 16, 2022 
Those marshals, if they would like to 
divulge their information, they are free 
to do so as U.S. citizens. But there are 
privacy agreements with attorney-cli-
ent privilege that is clearly not being 
able to be pursued in this fashion. So 
my opinion does not matter. What 
matters is the law. I do not serve in the 
Department of Justice; therefore I can-
not answer your question. 
Mr. COTTON. Unfortunately, they 
don’t have any information to divulge. 
That is part of my point. The Depart-
ment of Justice won’t tell them why 
they are not being represented. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to join my good colleague 
Senator ROSEN
and my other col-
leagues in urging our friend and Sen-
ator from Arkansas to allow the nomi-
nation of these candidates for U.S. at-
torney and U.S. marshal to move for-
ward. 
And let me just start by answering 
the question that you have posed to 
both of my colleagues because I think 
it needs to be reframed. I think the 
premise really is this. There is no 
doubt that your ultimate goal here— 
and you have an ultimate goal that 
you are trying to achieve, and I don’t 
question that. I do question, though, 
the procedure and the means by which 
you choose to succeed in your goal. 
And that is what we are talking about, 
Senator COTTON, because, at the end of 
the day, what you are trying to do is 
literally stand for U.S. marshals while 
at the same time harming the U.S. 
Marshals Service by not allowing two 
nominees to go before and get ap-
pointed to the U.S. Marshals Service. 
Likewise, you are adding to that—U.S. 
attorneys across the country, including 
one in the State of Nevada, who are on 
the frontlines of the law and order that 
we need in this country. 
As you well know, U.S. attorneys 
work with U.S. marshals across the 
country to address violent crime in 
this country and prosecute it, to ad-
dress drug trafficking, human traf-
ficking, murders, and so on. So that 
means what you are trying to achieve 
here is actually harming law and order 
across the country. I don’t think you 
intend to do that. I hope not. But that 
is what we are questioning right now, 
is the means by which you are trying 
to achieve here—what we are asking is 
for you to reconsider because at the 
end of the day—and I heard you earlier. 
I think you made some comment say-
ing: Sorry your lawyers have to wait to 
get confirmed in a week or two. You 
know better. These aren’t just lawyers. 
You know U.S. attorneys across this 
country are on the frontline of law and 
order. They are key to prosecuting es-
sential crimes that we need to address 
in this country, including working 
with our U.S. marshals along with the 
FBI and other essential Federal Agen-
cies. 
I would ask that you reconsider the 
means by which you are trying to 
achieve your goal because in Nevada, 
the position of U.S. attorney has been 
vacant for a full year. The President 
has nominated Jason Frierson for that 
role. As you heard, Senator ROSEN and 
I both support this excellent candidate, 
and the full Senate needs to confirm 
him and let him get to work. 
You have heard his background. He is 
more than qualified for this position, 
and I am not hearing from you that 
you have concerns about his qualifica-
tions. But he is essential to ensure that 
we get somebody in place, confirmed 
very swiftly, so that he can get to work 
on behalf of the people in the State of 
Nevada and be on the frontlines of ad-
dressing and ensuring we have law and 
order not only in Nevada but across the 
country in these other States. 
My question to you, Senator COTTON, 
is, would you reconsider the means by 
which you are trying to achieve your 
goal so that you are not harming those 
men and women who are on the 
frontlines of law and order across the 
country, including here in the State of 
Nevada that we are talking about? And 
you will hear from some of my other 
colleagues. 
So I pose the question to you, Sen-
ator, through the Chair. 
Mr. COTTON. If that is a question for 
me, I reject the premise of your ques-
tion. I am not harming law enforce-
ment; I am standing up for law enforce-
ment. 
Once again, if you deny four U.S. 
marshals legal representation because 
they stood up to leftwing street mili-
tias—which may be unpopular in cer-
tain quarters of your party—then you 
cause every marshal across the country 
and, for that matter, every law en-
forcement official across the country 
to doubt whether their political superi-
ors are going to defend them in the fu-
ture. 
Look, if you want to have a broader 
debate about law enforcement, I can, 
but we are going to be here for a long 
time. 
It is your party that voted in lock-
step for the FIRST STEP Act that let 
thousands of violent felons back on the 
street who have now committed innu-
merable violent crimes. It is your 
party that marched and chanted in the 
streets for defunding the police. It is 
the 
Democratic 
floor 
leader 
who 
blocked my resolution in the summer 
of 2020 to condemn the ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ movement. You all voted in lock-
step to confirm Vanita Gupta, the As-
sociate Attorney General, who is re-
sponsible ultimately for these deci-
sions, even though I and other Repub-
licans cautioned you she would use her 
position to wage a war on the police 
from the Department of Justice. That 
is what is happening now. 
I am standing up for law enforce-
ment. 
Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator 
from Nevada yield for a point? 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Yes. 
Mr. DURBIN. The FIRST STEP Act— 
the Democrats did the FIRST STEP 
Act, the Republicans were in the ma-
jority. It was a bill sponsored by Sen-
ators GRASSLEY, DURBIN, LEE, and 
many others. Who signed it into law? 
Donald Trump signed it into law, this 
so-called Democratic measure. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I am disappointed because I hear 
my colleague, but he is not listening. 
He keeps repeating the same talking 
point that he is defending law enforce-
ment when, at the same time, he is 
harming law enforcement across the 
country. This really is nonsensical. It 
does not make sense not only to me 
and my colleagues but to the general 
public that is watching. 
We are talking about filling positions 
at the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. 
Attorney’s Offices across the country. 
They are essential to addressing what 
we see across the country and ensuring 
that there is law and order. 
So it is the means by which you are 
trying to achieve your goal which we 
would ask you to consider. Unfortu-
nately, I am not hearing from my col-
league from Arkansas that he is willing 
to reconsider it and stand up for law 
and order across this country and sup-
port the U.S. Attorney’s Offices and 
marshals who need to be appointed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. To respond to the Sen-
ator from Illinois, it is true that Presi-
dent Trump signed the FIRST STEP 
Act. The FIRST STEP Act was the 
worst mistake of the Trump adminis-
tration. Yes, it is true that a number of 
Republican Senators voted for it. They 
were wrong. They didn’t start demand-
ing that we defund the police in the 
summer of 2020. They condemned that. 
They stood up for law enforcement. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, 
I join my colleagues, the Senators from 
Nevada and Minnesota, in my frustra-
tion as to why we are here today. 
Today, I am joining them and urging 
my colleagues to join me in calling for 
the swift confirmation of Chief LaDon 
Reynolds to be the U.S. marshal for the 
Northern District of Illinois. As a sea-
soned law enforcement officer, Chief 
Reynolds is more than ready to take on 
the challenges of this important lead-
ership role, including playing a key 
part in addressing the rising violent 
crime devastating our communities in 
Northern Illinois. 
Yet the only reason he is not already 
confirmed to this position is because of 
a hold from Senator COTTON—a hold 
that is completely unrelated to Chief 
Reynolds’ 
immense 
qualifications. 
These qualifications include serving 
with distinction as the chief of police 
of the Oak Park Police Department for 
nearly 30 years, teaching law enforce-
ment officers about the importance of 
community-oriented policing at the Il-
linois Law Enforcement Training and

Standards Board Executive Institute, 
and working to protect communities 
from rising hate as a board member of 
Governor Pritzker’s Commission on 
Discrimination and Hate Crimes. 
Senator DURBIN and I carefully re-
viewed Chief Reynolds’ experience and 
expertise. It is clear to us and the 
White House that he is the best fit for 
the job. What we are asking for now is 
simply to let Reynolds get to work; let 
him take charge of an office that has 
already gone without Senate-confirmed 
leadership for 4 years. We need to have 
a confirmed U.S. marshal leading Fed-
eral law enforcement operations to se-
cure our Federal courthouses and cap-
ture violent fugitives of the law. 
As U.S. marshal, Reynolds would also 
play an important role in the Biden ad-
ministration’s 
multijurisdictional 
strike force to investigate and pros-
ecute gun traffickers channeling dead-
ly weapons into the city of Chicago. 
Every day, there are new stories of 
horrifying and often deadly impacts of 
rising violent crimes in the Northern 
District of Illinois. In fact, last year 
was one of the city of Chicago’s dead-
liest in decades. 
But statistics alone cannot fully de-
scribe the devastation our commu-
nities have endured. For so many 
Chicagoans, the presence of gun vio-
lence is a constant source of trauma 
and grief in their day-to-day lives. It is 
painful and gut-wrenching to see this 
sort of senseless violence happen again 
and again. 
We cannot wait any longer to ad-
vance Reynolds’ confirmation, espe-
cially not for his nomination to be used 
as a pawn for Senator COTTON to expe-
dite a response to his unrelated pend-
ing inquiry to the U.S. Department of 
Justice. Instead, we must act to make 
sure the Northern District of Illinois 
U.S. Marshal’s Office has the leader-
ship it needs to fulfill its mission of ad-
ministering justice and enforcing the 
law. 
If Senator COTTON is serious about 
tackling violent crime and making our 
communities safe, then we must move 
forward with confirming LaDon Rey-
nolds to be the next U.S. marshal for 
the Northern District of Illinois now. 
Chief Reynolds’ nomination has my 
full support. 
I request that Senator COTTON lift his 
blanket hold on the U.S. attorney and 
U.S. marshal nominees pending consid-
eration before the Senate, including 
Reynolds’ nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. We keep hearing that 
this is unrelated, as if I am upset with 
something the Coast Guard did or the 
Corps of Engineers wants to improve 
some water project in Arkansas. These 
are Department of Justice nominees, 
and right now, the Department of Jus-
tice is not standing up for law enforce-
ment officers by hanging these four 
marshals out to dry. That is why I am 
not agreeing to fast-track these nomi-
nees. I am not going to agree to fast- 
track political nominees while the De-
partment of Justice hangs out to dry 
career law enforcement officers. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Fast-track? Fast-track? 
Senator CORTEZ MASTO said it has been 
a year since they have had a U.S. at-
torney confirmed, sitting in Nevada. In 
Ohio now, it has been—let me count 
the days—404 days since 6 million peo-
ple in the Northern District of Ohio 
last had a permanent U.S. attorney 
leading the office. Senator COTTON, 
with his demagoguery, comes down 
here and talks about fast-track? I don’t 
know what speed they move in Arkan-
sas, but I would not consider what we 
are trying to do as fast-track. 
They 
have 
been 
vetted. 
Senator 
PORTMAN supports this nominee. Let 
me talk about that. 
We know the pandemic has caused an 
alarming rise in violent crime, espe-
cially gun crimes. The Northern Dis-
trict of Ohio, which includes Toledo, 
Cleveland, 
Akron, 
Canton, 
Youngs-
town, Mansfield, Warren—cities in ba-
sically the northern half of the State. 
The U.S. attorney has the highest case-
load in the last 30 years, filing a record 
846 indictments in 2021 alone without a 
full-time, confirmed U.S. attorney. 
Even before the pandemic, the dis-
trict had a staggering caseload after 
reaching a record low in 2016, with only 
363 new cases through, Senator COTTON, 
I might add, the Obama administra-
tion. The number of new cases began to 
climb in 2017, at the beginning of the 
Trump administration, if you want to 
play those games, Senator COTTON. The 
number of new cases rose to 706 in 2018. 
This as kept climbing since. Last year, 
there were 170 homicides in the city of 
Cleveland, where my wife and I live— 
another 30-year record—not to mention 
a surge in carjackings. 
We need to fill key law enforcement 
positions in Ohio and, as Senator COR-
TEZ
MASTO
said, as Senator DURBIN 
said, in their States—and Senator 
ROSEN
and Senator DUCKWORTH. We 
need to fill these key law enforcement 
positions. 
I hear from Ohio police officers that 
they are in desperate need of help, 
while we, through—Senator COTTON 
and others accuse Democrats of under-
mining police or whatever term they 
use—a term that none of us use—when 
we have supported local governments 
with more dollars so they can hire 
more police while you oppose those 
same positions, as we know. So we are 
working with local police to get them 
that help, whether it is confirming U.S. 
marshals, whether it is confirming U.S. 
attorneys. 
Thankfully, we have an extremely 
qualified nominee in Ohio who is ready 
and eager to serve. The only thing 
standing in our way is the U.S. Senate. 
Apparently, the only thing standing in 
the Senate’s way is Senator COTTON, 
although I am sure somebody else 
would be willing to take his place. 
Marissa Darden is a seasoned pros-
ecutor with extensive experience, a 
lead attorney in both civil and crimi-
nal cases. As an assistant U.S. attorney 
in the Northern District, she was rec-
ognized for her work on several cases 
involving highly complex legal issues. 
She received the National High Inten-
sity Drug Trafficking Areas Award for 
outstanding opioid investigation effort 
in 2016 and for outstanding investiga-
tive effort in 2019. 
Listen to what some people have 
said. Federal District Court Judge 
Benita Pearson: You can be assured 
that Darden will fiercely enforce the 
law while treating all—attorneys, staff, 
the accused, and the community—with 
respect and appropriate sensitivity. 
Former Acting U.S. Attorney Justin 
Herdman, 
nominated 
by 
President 
Trump 
and 
supported 
by 
Senator 
PORTMAN and me both—U.S. Attorney 
Justin Herdman was the last confirmed 
U.S. attorney in the Northern District. 
He described her as an attorney of out-
standing ability and unquestioned in-
tegrity. He said that she is a leader 
who has a proven track record of deliv-
ering results inside and outside the 
courtroom. 
First Assistant Federal Public De-
fender Jacqueline Johnson told us that 
this was her first recommendation for 
U.S. attorney in 38 years of practicing 
in the Northern District. She said she 
based her recommendation on her be-
lief that Ms. Darden possesses the in-
tellect, vision, temperament, and judg-
ment needed to lead the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office during this perilous sea-
son. 
DEA Special Agent in Charge Keith 
Martin. With 26 years of experience, 
she is one of the best he has ever en-
countered, he said. He explained that 
she was phenomenal in her interaction 
with law enforcement, cooperative, and 
stands on her principles. He can’t 
imagine a better choice. 
These qualifications—I repeat that 
Senator PORTMAN
also supports Ms. 
Darden’s nomination. Her confirmation 
would also be historic, making her the 
first African-American woman to ever 
serve as U.S. attorney in Ohio. 
Unfortunately, 
Senator 
COTTON 
blocks this nomination in addition to 
these eight other law enforcement 
nominees. By his own admission, his 
objections to these nominees have 
nothing to do with their qualifications. 
I support his desire to get answers 
from DOJ. He should get them. But the 
solution for his disagreement with DOJ 
is not with the 6 million Ohio citizens 
who pay a price or the millions of citi-
zens in Illinois or in Nevada who pay a 
price, or Minnesota or anywhere. 
The last thing I will say, last week I 
spoke with police officers, one of the 
many kind of roundtable zooms I do 
around the State with police officers 
from around the State. One officer con-
veyed his colleagues’ frustration with 
politics today. He told me that officers 
in his department have begun leaving 
letters on their lockers that say, if

they are killed in the line of duty, they 
want no elected officials invited to 
their funerals. 
He said, the notes don’t say no Demo-
crats, no Republicans; they say no 
elected officials. A whole bunch of 
them. The reason for that is the games-
manship we see right now, that we are 
not willing to confirm U.S. attorneys, 
U.S. marshals, in many cases, Federal 
district judges, just because some-
body’s been offended by the lack of a 
letter or something somebody at the 
Justice Department said to them. 
The fact is we need to do this. It will 
help our States, it will help our coun-
try combat crime. 
Let’s heed this officer’s warning and 
come together to get qualified and tal-
ented law enforcement officials and 
professionals on the job. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, so 
contrary to what the Senator from 
Ohio says, I am not offended by the 
lack of a letter or offended by some-
thing someone said. I’m offended that 
four U.S. marshals—four U.S. marshals 
had to decide whether they are going 
to have enough money to buy Christ-
mas gifts for their kids, pay their 
mortgage next month, put braces on 
their kids, send them to summer camp 
because that is the position that the 
Department of Justice has put them in. 
To recap, four U.S. marshals were 
among dozens deployed to Portland 
last summer to guard the courthouse 
from leftwing street militias. They 
were targeted with blinding lasers, ball 
bearings, fireworks. There was an ef-
fort to barricade them into the court-
house and set it afire to burn them 
alive. 
Now leftwing activists in leftwing or-
ganizations like the ACLU are suing 
them, and the Department of Justice 
won’t provide them representation, 
won’t even tell them why they are not 
providing them representation. 
Maybe they engaged in some kind of 
misconduct? Maybe it was excessive 
force? That would be strange, because 
all four of these deputy marshals are 
now back on unrestricted active duty 
with the special operations group of 
the Marshal Service, the element most 
likely to be sent into the most dan-
gerous circumstances and have to use 
violence, including lethal violence. 
It would be pretty strange to send 
them back to the special operations 
group with no restrictions if they en-
gaged in some kind of misconduct in 
Portland. That is what this is about 
and what it does to undermine the 
faith and confidence of every career 
law enforcement professional in the 
Department of Justice. 
So, no, I will not agree to fast-track 
political nominees to the Department 
when the Department leadership is 
hanging out to dry career law enforce-
ment officers. 
Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? I ask the question 
through the Chair. 
Has the Senator been given a privacy 
waiver by the one marshal that the De-
partment of Justice is not going to de-
fend? 
Mr. COTTON. No, I have not. But I 
know that the response that that mar-
shal received was that the denial of 
representation was not in the interest 
of the United States. No more—— 
Mr. DURBIN. How much time do we 
have? I am sorry. Go ahead. 
Mr. COTTON. No more facts, no more 
explanation, just like the three who 
are waiting for a determination and 
have been waiting for more than a year 
do not have any fact-based expla-
nation. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how 
much time do we have remaining? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
are 1 minute 13 seconds. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, that 
last admission by the Senator from Ar-
kansas 
tells 
the 
whole 
story. 
He 
doesn’t even know why the Department 
is turning down representation of 1 per-
son out of 74. They have agreed to rep-
resent 70 of these U.S. marshal employ-
ees, and they said they will represent 
them; and three are under review. One 
has been turned down; and he hasn’t re-
ceived a privacy waiver, so he doesn’t 
know why. I don’t know why either. 
But you know who is paying the price 
for it? 
Millions of Americans who are asking 
for Federal law enforcement to be ade-
quately staffed to do their job. The 
U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals that 
want to keep us safe and be part of the 
team to do that. And because this Sen-
ator suspects there may be something 
suspicious about this, he doesn’t have a 
privacy waiver, he is going to hold up 
those officials throughout the United 
States and put their communities in 
peril. Tell me that that is devotion to 
law enforcement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. This is exactly the 
point. Privacy waiver or not, what does 
it matter? Here is what we do know. 
Here is what we do know. That none of 
these four know why they were denied 
representation or why they haven’t had 
a determination. We know that. And 
we know that they were sent back on 
unrestricted active duty to the special 
operations group. 
I think the Department of Justice po-
litical leadership owes these brave law 
enforcement officers an answer before 
it hangs them out to dry and exposes 
them to risk of financial ruin and 
bankruptcy. 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all 
time yielded back? 
Mr. COTTON. I yield back. 
VOTE ON WALLANDER NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Wallander nomination?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The bill clerk called the roll.

CRIME 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
have come to this floor before for the 
same subject, but I now come to ex-
press my concerns once again about 
the rise in crime in America. Now I 
want to express what that rise in crime 
means for everybody if we don’t stop it. 
If we don’t act soon, and don’t reverse 
the trend of tolerating crime, a genera-
tion of Americans will see the greatest 
cities fall once again into decay. We 
have seen it before, and it is not some-
thing that we want to see again. To 
stop it, we must allow the police to en-
force the law and demand that prosecu-
tors do their job. 
A couple of generations of Americans 
have now grown up not knowing how 
dangerous some of our biggest cities 
used to be. The two that come to mind 
are New York and Washington, DC. 
First, let’s look at New York 20, 40 
years ago. When asked what they think 
of Times Square in Manhattan, most 
younger Americans would probably say 
that it is a tourist trap. But it wasn’t 
always that way. In the 1970s, Times 
Square was an open sore, filled with 
adult theaters, drugs, and rampant 
crime. Back then, the New York City 
subway looked like something from 
some dystopian horror movie. In other 
words, you avoided New York City sub-
ways if you could. 
Now, let’s turn to Washington, DC, in 
the late 1980s. Its decay could almost 
be traced back entirely to one person. 
Just a few blocks from here where we 
are standing right now, a drug dealer 
named Rayful Edmond ran the most 
notorious crack cocaine operation in 
the country. By 1989, he was bringing 
1,700 pounds of cocaine into DC every 
month. He used to put snipers on roof-
tops near his headquarters. Police sus-
pected his operation was involved in 30 
homicides. During that time, the city’s 
murder rate doubled. Washington had 
the nickname the ‘‘murder capital of 
the world.’’ 
Then 
something 
great 
happened. 
Mayors and prosecutors got serious 
about dealing with crime. They sent 
Rayful Edmond to jail for life. People 
who lived in cities felt much safer. 
Businesses flourished. Pervasive fear 
gradually lessened because police took 
criminals off the street. 
The crime rates in New York and 
Washington plummeted. Young fami-
lies moved to urban neighborhoods 
that were far too dangerous just a few 
years before. This was wonderful, obvi-
ously. The block where Rayful Edmond 
once put his snipers on rooftops is now 
a very normal residential street. 
Our cities, everybody knows, should 
be places where we want to live. We 
should enjoy going there to see other 
people. We shouldn’t avoid cities be-
cause we are afraid of getting harassed 
on the streets or carjacked, at the 
worst. But that is what is beginning to 
happen again. All over the country, our 
biggest cities are starting to look dan-
gerous and empty. History repeats and 
repeats. 
Cities are devolving into what they 
were just a couple of decades ago. 
Homicides in 22 major cities have gone 
up 44 percent since 2019. Carjackings 
are up double, even triple, and worse in 
some cities. Thieves are stealing from 
stores with impunity. When that hap-
pens, those businesses shut down, leav-
ing neighborhoods with empty store-
fronts and a recipe for urban decline. 
Crime is up because of the permissive 
approach by too many so-called pro-
gressive prosecutors. One prosecutor in 
San Francisco has said that if you 
steal less than $950, you won’t be pros-
ecuted. No wonder people are commit-
ting more crimes. These prosecutors 
see criminals as victims, releasing 
them back into the streets shortly 
after being arrested. This sows fear in 
local residents. Common sense ought to 
tell everybody that. Common sense 
says it kills growth. Common sense 
says it hurt neighborhoods. Common 
sense says it endangers regular people 
who want to live their lives peacefully. 
America is a nation of progress. We 
are a nation of progress moving for-
ward. Our current backward slide to 
urban decays in the 1970s and 1980s is 
tragic. 
Working-class 
families 
and 
those who can’t afford to move some-
where safer will bear the brunt of it. 
The solution here is not very com-
plicated. A recent poll showed two out 
of every three people know what some 
of these blue-city mayors haven’t fig-
ured out yet: More police equals less 
crime. 
When prosecutors list a whole bunch 
of crimes that they won’t prosecute, it 
encourages lawbreaking. Also, we need 
to stop the crusade to defund the po-
lice. They need to stop progressive 
prosecutors. You know, I know there is 
prosecutorial discretion. We all know 
that not every crime can be punished 
or prosecuted. 
But if you were a smart prosecutor 
who didn’t want to encourage more 
crime, you wouldn’t tell the whole 
world that certain crimes aren’t going 
to be punished and others will be pun-
ished, because that is inviting those 
laws to be broken. That is why you see 
dozens of people rushing into a retail 
store, grabbing everything they can 
that is under $950 and leave. 
Prosecutors ought to keep their 
mouths shut and just do the job; and if 
they use discretion, keep it to them-
selves not to punish some crimes. 
So we need to make sure that repeat 
offenders and those who are a threat to 
society 
don’t 
get 
bail. 
Otherwise, 
younger generations of America will 
learn all over again the harsh lessons 
about how quickly our greatest cities 
can fall into decay. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
am on the floor today to talk about the 
nomination 
of 
Ambassador 
Julieta 
Valls Noyes, to serve as Assistant Sec-
retary of State for the Bureau of Popu-
lation, Refugees, and Migration. 
Originally nominated last July, Am-
bassador Noyes’ nomination was re-
ported favorably out of the Foreign Re-
lations Committee in October. 
Since then, she has waited in limbo 
for all of us to act. Ambassador Noyes 
has a distinguished 35-year career with 
the State Department, serving in im-
portant and challenging roles, many of 
those roles tied directly to the work 
she would be doing at the Bureau of 
Population, Refugees, and Migration, 
often referred to as PRM. 
As Ambassador to Croatia, she pre-
sided over the final stages of a refugee 
resettlement program after the Balkan 
wars, 
while 
hosting 
regional 
con-
ferences and trainings for prosecutors, 
police, and judges on refugee-related 
issues. 
As Deputy Assistant Secretary in the 
Bureau of European and Eurasian Af-
fairs, Ambassador Noyes oversaw the

nations with 11 Western European 
countries and the European Union, 
some of our country’s most critical 
partners. 
From 2005 to 2007, Ambassador Noyes 
was Director of Multilateral and Global 
Affairs in the Bureau of Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Labor, where she 
ran 
international 
negotiations 
on 
human rights—both at the United Na-
tions in New York and in Geneva. 
In that capacity, she also held con-
sultations with the European Union, 
with the African Union, with other 
partners. And she was a member of 
high-level delegations that presented 
periodic reports to the United Nations 
on U.S. compliance with major inter-
national human rights treaties. 
She has been recognized as a strong 
manager. 
She 
has 
overseen 
large 
teams. She has administered huge 
budgets. 
In addition to all of this, she is the 
daughter of Cuban refugees who di-
rectly benefited from the work of the 
Bureau of Population, Refugees, and 
Migration, so she has a personal con-
nection to the importance of the Bu-
reau’s work. 
When you think about that list of 
qualifications, she is really the ideal 
person to lead PRM. What is the rush, 
some may ask. PRM hasn’t had a con-
firmed Assistant Secretary since the 
days of the Obama administration. 
Well, all the more reason that it 
should have one now. It shouldn’t be a 
rudderless organization when address-
ing so many important issues for our 
Nation. 
PRM has a major role in human 
rights and humanitarian efforts rights 
abroad as well as providing aid to refu-
gees here at home. 
PRM is responsible for directing 
more than $3 billion in lifesaving hu-
manitarian aid around the world to 
more than 84 million forcibly displaced 
people. Eighty percent of those are 
women and children. So if you care 
about the plight of women and children 
around the world, you want to have an 
experienced leader making sure those 
dollars are efficiently allocated to the 
best effect. 
PRM leads the rebuilding of the U.S. 
refugee 
assistance 
program. 
PRM 
works with other governments to pro-
mote regional migration resolutions. 
PRM 
advances 
international 
popu-
lation policies that save mothers and 
babies and prevent gender-based vio-
lence around the world. 
PRM leads diplomatic efforts for 
international burden sharing to better 
reduce suffering and to be more effec-
tive in saving lives. 
And PRM is a critical part of our na-
tional security infrastructure, vetting 
those who come into our country, en-
suring they don’t pose a risk to our 
safety and security. 
The Bureau is doing all this, but they 
are doing it without a leader to make 
sure they do it in the most effective, 
professional, competent fashion. 
The Bureau is doing critical work 
every day to address these challenges, 
and those challenges are growing as 
more and more countries are disrupted 
by war and by famine and by corrup-
tion. 
So this Bureau deserves to have 
someone leading those efforts who has 
the type of background that the Am-
bassador has. All of us who want to see 
these 
programs 
administered 
effec-
tively have a stake in having com-
petent leadership in place. 
Thus, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate consider the following nom-
ination, Calendar No. 462, Julieta Valls 
Noyes, to be an Assistant Secretary of 
State; that the nomination be con-
firmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; that any re-
lated statements be printed in the 
RECORD and that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
Throughout 
his 
administration, 
President Biden has shown a shocking 
disregard for congressional authority 
and oversight. 
Following his botched and deadly 
withdrawal 
from 
Afghanistan, 
the 
Biden administration has refused to 
take accountability or provide answers 
to Congress or the American people. 
The President repeatedly shifts blame 
and hides from the truth. His adminis-
tration demands to have closed, so- 
called classified hearings, even though 
none of the material being discussed is 
classified information. 
We still don’t even know how many 
Americans are trapped in Afghanistan. 
We don’t know how many Americans 
are trapped in Afghanistan. Biden 
abandoned them behind enemy lines. 
It is wrong. It left many Americans 
with no faith in President Biden’s abil-
ity to lead or appoint qualified individ-
uals to serve in these important roles. 
That is why I cannot and will not 
consent to allowing this nominee to 
move forward in an expedited manner. 
We should take a vote so every Senator 
can get on the record with their sup-
port or opposition to this nominee. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
would love for us to have a full, ordi-
nary process here on the floor and to 
have all of us on both sides of the aisle 
support that process. 
I come to the floor to ask for this 
unanimous consent because that proc-
ess has been frustrated, and we now 
have been without a leader for this en-
tire administration. 
My colleague made a point about Af-
ghanistan, and he said we need to know 
how many Americans are in Afghani-
stan. If you want better action on the 
issue of Americans as refugees abroad 
or stranded abroad, then you want to 
have a responsible leader, an account-
able leader, heading up the Bureau of 
Population, Migration, and Refugees. 
So let’s do our job here in this Cham-
ber because when we fail to enable such 
a critical organization, responsible for 
billions of dollars around the world 
being provided to millions of people, 
responsible for the vetting of people 
coming into our country, when we fail 
to do our job to put somebody in 
charge, we are only wounding our-
selves. 
This is exactly the type of partisan 
paralysis and destruction that is dam-
aging our Nation. We need to get this 
confirmation completed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
REMEMBERING ELIZABETH PERATROVICH 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor this evening to 
speak in honor and recognition of a 
woman by the name of Elizabeth 
Peratrovich. 
Elizabeth Peratrovich is recognized 
in my State of Alaska as a champion, 
a relentless champion, for civil rights 
for all Alaskans. 
It is on this day, the 16th of Feb-
ruary, that the State of Alaska ob-
serves Elizabeth Peratrovich Day. In 
communities 
across 
the 
State, 
in 
schools, cultural centers, you are going 
to be seeing activities to honor this 
really remarkable Alaska Native lead-
er. 
PBS has an award-winning show for 
children called ‘‘Molly of Denali.’’ It is 
a great TV show, and they recently had 
an episode highlighting the story of 
Elizabeth Peratrovich. 
It was just 2 years ago, now, that her 
image was placed on a dollar coin 
issued by the U.S. Mint. So that rec-
ognition has gone beyond the State of 
Alaska, clearly, to the national and the 
Federal level. 
So as we are celebrating Elizabeth 
Peratrovich Day back home, I am 
going to share a little bit of her story 
with the Senate because it is a legacy 
of seeking and realizing a more inclu-
sive society and certainly a more rep-
resentative democracy. 
Elizabeth was a Tlingit, a member of 
the Raven/Sockeye or Lukaax-Adi clan. 
She was actually born on Independence 
Day, born in Petersburg, AK, in 1911. 
And it was just a year after that, 
1912, a group of Native people from 
across the southeastern part of the 
State mobilized to form an organiza-
tion called the Alaska Native Brother-
hood, ANB. Then, 2 years later, they 
formed the Alaska Native Sisterhood. 
ANB, ANS these are considered the old-
est indigenous civil rights organiza-
tions in the world, started right there 
in southeastern Alaska. 
ANB and ANS sought to advance 
equal opportunities for education, for 
employment, for housing, and they 
fought to secure Native civil rights. 
Elizabeth married Roy Peratrovich, 
and the two of them became very ac-
tive in ANB and ANS activities in the 
1940s.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S750 
February 16, 2022 
In 1941, they had moved to Juneau, 
and they encountered a level of dis-
crimination in that community against 
Alaska Native peoples that, as we look 
at the accounts of the time, paralleled 
the Jim Crow practices in the South, 
but it strengthened their resolve. It 
strengthened 
their 
commitment 
to 
fight back against the discrimination 
that they saw. 
Through their work with ANB and 
ANS, Elizabeth and Roy began advo-
cating for an antidiscrimination bill in 
the Territorial legislature. If you will 
recall, we didn’t become a State until 
1959. This is the early forties, and they 
are talking about an antidiscrimina-
tion bill in our legislature. They point-
ed out to all who would listen that 
Alaska Natives were paying taxes for a 
public school system that excluded 
their children. They weren’t part of 
that school system. They pointed out 
that Alaska Native men were fighting 
in World War II, but then on their re-
turn, they were denied rights that 
other veterans enjoyed. 
Those fundamental discriminations 
and many more were what drove their 
pursuit for equal rights not just for 
Alaska Natives but for all people in 
Alaska. 
So they had gone to Juneau in 1941. 
That 
antidiscrimination 
bill 
didn’t 
pass immediately. It was reintroduced 
in 1945. And there is a lot of discussion 
about the pivotal moment in time 
when eyes were opened and, really, 
minds were also opened in awareness. 
This was the time of debate where 
this antidiscrimination bill had passed 
the house, had moved over to the sen-
ate, and there was a Territorial senator 
who denounced these efforts to deseg-
regate, and he stood up on the senate 
floor, and he said: 
Who are these people, barely out of sav-
agery, who want to associate with us whites, 
with 5,000 years of recorded civilization be-
hind us? 
Pretty inflammatory if you are sit-
ting there in those Senate chambers 
listening 
to 
that, 
certainly—cer-
tainly—to an Alaska Native person. 
At the end of the debate, the public 
was offered a chance to express their 
views in front of the legislature. That 
is not something that you have happen 
in most legislatures. We don’t have it 
in our legislature now, but in our Ter-
ritorial legislature, the public was of-
fered a chance to weigh in here. 
And Elizabeth Peratrovich stood in 
the back of this senate gallery, and in 
her remarks, she said: 
I would not have expected that I, who am 
‘‘barely out of savagery,’’ would have to re-
mind the gentleman with 5,000 years of re-
corded civilization behind them of our Bill of 
Rights. 
And when asked if she thought that 
the bill would eliminate discrimina-
tion, she replied: 
Do your laws against larceny and even 
murder prevent those crimes? No law will 
eliminate crimes, but at least you as legisla-
tors can assert to the world that you recog-
nize the evil of the present situation and 
speak your intent to help us overcome dis-
crimination. 
Imagine this scene. You are part of 
this legislative body, and from the 
back of the gallery, a Native woman 
stands to speak to address this elected 
body. 
Following her comments, there was a 
long period of silence, and then there 
was applause through the gallery and 
through the senate floor, including 
from some who had previously opposed 
the bill. 
Alaska’s Governor at the time, Er-
nest Gruening, went on to sign the 
antidiscrimination act, the Nation’s 
first antidiscrimination act, signed 
into law on February 16, 1945. This was 
almost two decades before the land-
mark Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
So it is something that when we in 
Alaska think about the history of dis-
crimination that we have had, that cer-
tainly Alaska Native people have en-
dured—endured far too long—to have 
led the country in terms of putting 
into law the first antidiscrimination 
act in this country a couple decades be-
fore the Civil Rights Act advanced 
through this Congress. 
During an Indian Affairs Committee 
hearing on Native voting access last 
October, the president of the Alaska 
Federation Natives, Julie Kitka, re-
minded us that these events are not 
very old, and sometimes we think of 
Elizabeth Peratrovich as part of our 
history, but she, Elizabeth, and her 
husband Roy, and the impact that they 
had on Alaska and the way that they 
strengthened our democracy is our cur-
rent history as well. 
So we honor Elizabeth Peratrovich’s 
legacy of standing up for what is right. 
She is an inspiration because she set 
the example that when you see some-
thing wrong, you speak out and you do 
something about it. 
And she also provided a great exam-
ple for why we need to listen—why we 
need to listen to all perspectives and 
voices, especially those who have been 
left out or left behind, oftentimes in-
tentionally. 
I think of Stella Martin of Kake, AK, 
a champion of equal rights herself. She 
described Elizabeth Peratrovich as ‘‘a 
fighter with velvet gloves.’’ And she 
was 
truly 
a 
fighter. 
Elizabeth 
Peratrovich Day is also a timely re-
minder for those of us here in the U.S. 
Senate. We all have an obligation to 
respond to the calls from our constitu-
ents who are seeking protection, in-
cluding through electoral reforms and 
improvements for voter access. 
We all know that we went through a 
very partisan exercise on voting rights 
legislation here on the floor earlier 
this year. Some may say it is hard to 
see how that advanced the debate on 
this issue; but it didn’t change the un-
derlying fact that we do need to come 
together to advance good solid policy 
in this area. I am working with a group 
of Senators. There are around 16 of us, 
I think, total. But we are continuing to 
focus on these issues of election re-
form. We want to try to determine a bi-
partisan path forward so that we can 
actually move important safeguards 
and clarifications into the law. And it 
may not be easy to take on some of 
these complicated issues, particularly 
when you get the pulls from both sides 
to not engage to try to come to the 
middle. But like we did with the infra-
structure bill, like we are doing with 
the Violence Against Women Act, we 
need to follow a path that allows us to 
get some things done as opposed to 
simply sending messages. 
As 
Alaska 
celebrates 
Elizabeth 
Peratrovich, I hope the Senate will 
look to her legacy for inspiration as we 
seek unity and follow her example of 
treating our fellow citizens with re-
spect. We have got too much at stake 
to operate in any other lesser manner. 
I thank the Presiding Officer for his 
attention. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session to be in a 
period of morning business with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

ANNIVERSARY OF PROTESTS IN 
BAHRAIN 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has 
been 11 years since the people of Bah-
rain gathered in the streets of Manama 
to urge their leaders to grant them 
stronger economic, social, and human 
rights. Bahrainis of all backgrounds 
called upon their leaders for meaning-
ful change, for a voice at the table in 
the matters that affected their every-
day lives. But their activism was met 
with brutal repression from the King-
dom of Bahrain. 
Journalists and human rights activ-
ists have shared with the world how 
Bahrain’s national security forces vio-
lently beat unarmed protestors in the 
crowds, severely injuring and even kill-
ing protestors with tear gas, rubber 
bullets, and other live ammunition. 
The forces arbitrarily arrested and de-
tained journalists, pursued volunteers 
who were helping the injured, and 
spared no one, not even children. This 
anniversary is stained by the blood of 
the Bahraini people, and it pains me 
that despite over a decade of asking for

accountability and reform, there has 
been little change from their govern-
ment. 
The country’s leadership continues 
to commit and permit appalling human 
rights violations. Past reports from the 
U.S. State Department have high-
lighted the mistreatment of prisoners, 
including torture, inhumane punish-
ment, and lack of proper access to med-
ical care. Conditions have been further 
exacerbated by COVID–19, with two 
major outbreaks in overcrowded pris-
ons last year. Yet the government con-
tinues to deny access to human rights 
experts, including the U.N. Special 
Rapporteur on torture. 
The Bahrain Government has also at-
tempted to silence dissent by impris-
oning opposition leaders, outlawing op-
position parties, and banning online 
content as they see fit. The govern-
ment restricts free speech on social 
media from their people and requires 
news and broadcasting outlets to be 
government-sanctioned, effectively sti-
fling all independent journalism and 
healthy discourse. Additionally, re-
ports indicate that the Bahrain Gov-
ernment monitors activists and other 
targets of interest by hacking into 
their phones. 
My father was a journalist, so I know 
how vital freedom of speech and free-
dom of press are to a flourishing, stable 
country. As a staunch defender against 
government 
overreach 
and 
unwar-
ranted surveillance, I cannot stand idly 
by as the people of Bahrain live in con-
stant fear of surveillance, arrest, and 
imprisonment for simply voicing their 
thoughts. 
America must hold Bahrain to a high 
standard, as we do with all our allies. 
The United States maintains a stra-
tegic relationship with Bahrain, as the 
country cooperates on U.S. defense ini-
tiatives in the region and hosts the 
U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet. The United 
States represents a beacon of hope and 
democracy to the rest of the world, and 
we cannot remain silent in the face of 
over a decade of human rights viola-
tions and repression. 
This is a key year for change; Bah-
rain is slated to hold its parliamentary 
elections later this year. I strongly 
urge the Bahrain Government to allow 
peaceful demonstration and dissent, 
open their doors to independent over-
sight and international election ob-
servers, address their violations of 
human rights, and cease their attacks 
on free speech and free press. And dur-
ing this pivotal year, I also urge the 
Biden administration to hold the Bah-
rain Government accountable for their 
overdue promises of reform.

NATIONAL FFA WEEK 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the National FFA 
Organization and celebrate National 
FFA Week, February 19–26, 2022. This is 
a week to applaud the positive impact 
FFA has made on our country and ac-
knowledge the accomplishments of its 
members. 
Previously known as the Future 
Farmers of America, the National FFA 
Organization was founded in 1928 by a 
group of young farmers with dreams to 
develop an organization which would 
address the challenges of feeding a 
growing population. These young farm-
ers’ leadership, experience, and passion 
for the industry became a movement 
that, for nearly 100 years, has adapted 
to represent the entirety of agri-
culture, not just farming. The National 
FFA Organization has been an institu-
tion where students can grow as both 
agriculturists 
and 
leaders. 
Today, 
there are 735,038 FFA members in 8,817 
chapters across all 50 States, Puerto 
Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 
Washington, DC. In my home State of 
Arkansas, FFA has 229 chapters with 
close to 16,000 members. 
FFA is a part of an integrated model 
that implements classroom agricul-
tural education and hands-on, experi-
ential learning. I commend the more 
than 13,000 agricultural science teach-
ers and FFA advisers who prepare the 
next generation of leaders. It is be-
cause of them that we can be confident 
in the upcoming farmers, ranchers, for-
esters, agriculturalists, scientists, edu-
cators, and those who seek a career 
outside of the agricultural industry. 
I have been fortunate to spend some 
time with these impressive young peo-
ple. They hail from different parts of 
the country and come from unique 
backgrounds, but all possess the same 
passion for agriculture and service. It 
is always encouraging hearing FFA 
members share their experiences and 
goals for the future. There is no doubt 
they are prepared to make those goals 
reality. 
FFA is about more than preparing 
students for careers in agriculture. It 
teaches leadership skills, instills a 
sense of service, and places young Ar-
kansans and young people all over the 
country on the right path for success. 
After leaving their chapters, these 
young leaders continue to make a posi-
tive difference in the world around 
them. There are over 8 million FFA 
alumni. Alumni continue to use the 
knowledge and skills acquired while 
they were members. I know this to be 
true. Currently, I have eight FFA 
alumni on my staff, including some 
who 
received 
the 
highest 
degree 
achievable in the National FFA Orga-
nization and alumni who served as 
chapter, State, and national officers. 
FFA members inspire those they 
serve, and I, too, have been impressed 
by the members and their accomplish-
ments. I am increasingly optimistic 
about the future of agriculture, espe-
cially with passionate, dedicated lead-
ers, like the ones developed by FFA, at 
the helm. FFA members serve as a re-
minder that our future is bright. I am 
honored to applaud the great work of 
FFA at the local, State, and national 
level as we celebrate National FFA 
Week. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
ALASKA 2–1–1 SYSTEM 
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
Alaskans recognized February 11 to 
celebrate the Alaska 2–1–1 system, 
which connects community resource 
specialists with Alaskans in need of 
help finding vital services and re-
sources. The Alaska 2–1–1 system has 
been instrumental in providing Alas-
kans with information regarding key 
health and human services within their 
community. Alaskans utilize 2–1–1 in 
emergency situations when barriers to 
connecting to care are most chal-
lenging. The 2–1–1 system has provided 
information regarding COVID–19 test-
ing sites, vaccine clinics, and other 
services 
including 
childcare, 
emer-
gency food and shelter services, senior 
services, and alcohol and drug treat-
ment programs. One of the biggest 
challenges Alaskans continue to face is 
not knowing where to turn for help in 
their communities during a crisis. Hav-
ing a specialist available at no cost is 
a critical element in accessing support 
and services. The Alaska 2–1–1 system 
helps to bridge that gap for Alaskans. I 
thank all of those working at Alaska 2– 
1–1 for their service to our neighbors 
and State.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S755 
February 16, 2022 
colleagues Senator BROWN, Senator 
CASSIDY, and Senator CASEY. Our bill 
would ensure that workers who stepped 
up during the COVID–19 pandemic and 
performed essential work in hazardous 
conditions, including our first respond-
ers and critical supply chain workers, 
do not have their Social Security bene-
fits reduced for serving our country. 
Semiretired workers make invalu-
able contributions across all sectors of 
our economy. Workers who retire at 
age 62 may collect Social Security ben-
efits, but if these workers choose to 
continue working and earning income, 
then the retirement earnings test, or 
RET, will reduce the benefits they earn 
above a certain threshold. 
I have heard from many constituents 
who stepped up to perform essential 
work during the pandemic, only to find 
later that the income they earned dur-
ing that time unexpectedly put them 
above the statutory RET threshold. 
One of my constituents, a teacher aide 
at an Aroostook County elementary 
school, is an example of a semiretired 
worker who was negatively impacted 
by the RET. She worked extra hours 
delivering meals to children who were 
at home learning remotely from March 
through June of 2020, and as a result 
she earned more than the RET thresh-
old and had to pay money back to the 
Social Security Administration. I have 
also heard from semiretired nurses who 
agreed to work extra hours as our hos-
pitals were filled with COVID patients 
and part-time employees who worked 
overtime to produce desperately need-
ed personal protective equipment and 
COVID tests. They answered the call to 
fulfill vital roles when many of us were 
locked down in the early stages of the 
pandemic. 
Through no fault of their own, these 
workers’ incomes surpassed the RET 
threshold due to overtime and hazard 
pay. They must now pay back thou-
sands of dollars in benefits to the So-
cial Security Administration or face a 
temporary reduction in their benefits 
until the money is recouped. Mean-
while, the money they earned during 
this time was to compensate for the ex-
ceptional work performed during the 
pandemic, and these semiretired essen-
tial workers did not plan or budget for 
a reduction in benefits or a sudden ex-
pense. Mr. President, this is profoundly 
unfair for those who aided us during a 
crisis. 
The Supporting Essential Workers in 
Retirement Act would exempt pre-
mium pay earned by essential workers 
during the COVID–19 pandemic from 
the RET. We should incentivize essen-
tial work, not discourage it. I encour-
age my colleagues to join us in sup-
porting this bill to ensure that those 
brave individuals who performed essen-
tial work in hazardous conditions to 
help our country address a global pan-
demic are not punished for doing so. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. 
SINEMA, and Mr. KING): 
S. 3665. A bill to authorize certain 
aliens seeking asylum to be employed 
in the United States while their appli-
cations are being adjudicated; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise 
today to introduce the Asylum Seeker 
Work Authorization Act of 2022 with 
my colleagues Senator SINEMA
and 
Senator KING. This legislation would 
allow individuals seeking asylum to be 
eligible for employment authorizations 
starting 30 days after applying for asy-
lum, provided their applications are 
not frivolous; they are not detained; 
and their identities have been verified, 
with their names run through the fed-
eral—government’s 
terrorist 
watch 
lists. This change would allow asylum 
applicants to work, support them-
selves, and contribute to society with-
out being as dependent on assistance 
from local governments while their 
claims are being adjudicated. 
Under current law, asylum seekers 
must wait extended periods of time 
after filing their applications before 
they are allowed to apply for work per-
mits. These long waiting periods were 
originally adopted by the Clinton ad-
ministration—and then extended to a 
full year by the Trump administra-
tion—out of concern that some mi-
grants might apply for asylum pri-
marily as a means of getting a work 
authorization. Clearly, this change has 
only transferred the burden of care for 
these asylum seekers onto commu-
nities across the Nation. 
One such community is Portland, 
ME. Over the span of several months, a 
historic surge of asylum seekers has 
arrived in Portland after crossing our 
southern border. Currently, hundreds 
of asylum seekers are being housed in 
emergency shelters by the city of Port-
land. These asylum seekers could give 
a much needed boost to Maine busi-
nesses that are facing labor shortages— 
our State’s unemployment rate is just 
4.7 percent—but the lengthy work au-
thorization process prevents these asy-
lum seekers from getting jobs, even to 
support themselves. 
While the Federal Government has 
provided assistance to Portland and 
other communities around our country 
dealing with a surge in asylum seekers, 
it would be a better solution if those 
seeking asylum were able to join the 
workforce and achieve self-sufficiency 
as quickly as possible while awaiting 
the outcome of their cases. 
It is my hope that the changes pro-
posed by our bill will lessen the burden 
on the budgets of communities hosting 
asylum seekers, while allowing these 
individuals and their families to sup-
port themselves as they want to do, 
bringing needed skills to the cities and 
towns in which they settle. I encourage 
my colleagues to support it.
