RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF PAT DAUGHERTY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the life and legacy of Pat Daugherty, a 
pillar of the Centre region and the 
Penn State community. 
Pat Daugherty owned and operated 
the Tavern Restaurant for four decades 
in State College, Pennsylvania. He was 
a mentor to many, a friend to all, and 
a champion for our community. 
Sadly, Pat passed away on November 
7 at the age of 75. While his absence has 
been felt by friends, family, and loved 
ones, the outpouring of anecdotes and 
stories from those who have known Pat 
over the years has illustrated what can 
be truly described as a life well lived. 
Pat first arrived in State College in 
the early 1960s for his freshman year at 
Penn State University and proceeded 
to make the area home. He was a two- 
time graduate of the university with a 
bachelor’s and a master’s degree in 
civil engineering. 
While attending Penn State, Pat, 
like many students, worked an off- 
campus job. Pat’s place of employment 
was a historic inn turned restaurant 
called The Tavern. It would only be a 
few years later that Pat would return 
to The Tavern, this time as its owner. 
For the next 40 years, Pat welcomed 
students, staff, the Penn State nation, 
and visitors of all kinds to his res-
taurant. He always greeted them with 
a smile on his face and the goal to 
treat each person like family. 
Pat loved the community and loved 
Penn State. He cared so much for his 
town and would do everything he could 
to make it a better place. 
His drive to connect the community 
to the college and the college to the 
community was evident. Throughout 
the years of owning The Tavern, Pat 
employed hundreds of Penn State stu-
dents. He is beloved by generations due 
to his years of mentorship. 
He was always giving back; as an ac-
tive volunteer and avid sports lover, 
Pat was a supporter of all Penn State 
athletic programs. The Tavern estab-
lished several scholarships and an en-
dowment for freestyle wrestling. 
Leading up to Penn State’s biggest 
philanthropic event of the year, THON, 
The Tavern was a frequent place for 
fundraisers and team meetings. The 
Tavern 
actively 
supported 
Mount 
Nittany Medical Center, Nittany Val-
ley Symphony, Pennsylvania Chamber 
Orchestra, as well as the Central Penn-
sylvania Festival of the Arts. 
Pat was always putting his commu-
nity first. His passion to help others 
and make the community a better 
place did not go unnoticed, and his con-
tributions to State College cannot be 
overstated. 
In 1999, Penn State named him the 
Renaissance Fund Honoree. This title 
is an annual tribute to someone for a 
lifetime of service to Penn State and 
the State College community through 
philanthropy and civic leadership. That 
year, contributions to the Renaissance 
Fund endowed three scholarships in 
honor of Pat, his mother, and Tavern 
alumni. 
More than 20 years later, those schol-
arships are awarded to students with 
outstanding 
academic 
records 
who 
show the greatest financial need. Pat’s 
philanthropy did not stop with the uni-
versity. He continued to work to better 
the State College community, volun-
teering and serving among a variety of 
organizations. 
He was a member of the Downtown 
Improvement District, where he played 
a significant role in the planning of the 
future of downtown State College. He 
served on the board of the Chamber of 
Business and Industry of Centre Coun-
ty and the Pennsylvania Restaurant 
Association. 
He was always ready to lend a help-
ing hand, and in 2019 the board of Cen-
tre County’s Constitution Day celebra-
tion awarded Pat the inaugural James 
Madison Award for Civility in the Com-
munity. 
Mr. Speaker, I have fond memories of 
meeting with Pat in the community 
and especially on Capitol Hill, when he 
would travel to Washington on behalf 
of the Pennsylvania Restaurant Asso-
ciation. We often shared a laugh, and 
during one visit he may have even 
shared the recipe for the Tavern’s 
world renown ‘‘Original Sin’’ cocktail 
with my staff.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6862 
December 2, 2021 
Pat Daugherty’s work in the commu-
nity goes well beyond being a res-
taurateur. For more of his years he was 
a pillar of the community, a mentor, 
and an avid supporter of Penn State 
University and the greater Centre re-
gion. Most of all, Pat was someone who 
everyone called a friend. 
I extend my sincere condolences to 
Pat’s wife Ruth, his children, Sam and 
Dawn, and his family and friends. Pat 
will be so truly missed, and his legacy 
will live on forever. 
f 
KEEP YOUR PROMISE TO CALDOR 
FIRE VICTIMS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the 
Caldor fire raged in the Sierra Nevada 
of California for 68 days last summer, 
consuming more than 221,000 acres of 
forestland, making it the 15th largest 
and the 16th most destructive fire in 
the history of California. 
It literally wiped out the Gold Rush- 
era town of Grizzly Flats, and for days 
threatened the city of Lake Tahoe. It 
destroyed nearly 800 homes, leaving 
hundreds of families homeless and des-
titute. 
On September 13, President Biden 
visited the scene. On that occasion, of-
ficials from El Dorado County and the 
California Governor’s Office of Emer-
gency Services apprised him of the 
need to assist these displaced families. 
He said, ‘‘We’re going to take care of 
them. There’s a lot we can do, and it 
starts off being a Federal responsi-
bility, in my view.’’ 
The President was absolutely correct 
in that assessment. The fire exploded 
in the El Dorado National Forest that 
was catastrophically overgrown due to 
Federal environmental laws that have 
made removal of excess timber all but 
impossible. 
According to local officials I have 
spoken with, the excessive use of back-
fires by the Forest Service also appears 
to have needlessly exacerbated the fire. 
This fire is indeed a Federal responsi-
bility, and the Federal government 
owes to every one of the fire’s victims 
the full resources available to get them 
back on their feet. 
And yet, despite multiple appeals, 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency has refused to approve indi-
vidual assistance for the victims of the 
Caldor fire. 
The FEMA denial is a stunning dou-
ble standard when compared with as-
sistance granted in other fires that did 
far less damage. For example, the Cali-
fornia Office of Emergency Services 
identified nine other individual assist-
ance grants that FEMA approved in 
2021 for fires that cumulatively de-
stroyed fewer homes than those de-
stroyed by the Caldor fire alone. 
Survivors hoping to rebuild their 
homes face an insurance deficit of 
$200,000 or more. Many survivors are 
uninsured, and nearly all of them are 
underinsured due to the severity of re-
cent wildfire seasons. Some survivors 
who were able to remain on their prop-
erties still lack access to potable 
water. 
Moreover, 
residents 
of 
Grizzly 
Flats—the town completely wiped out 
by the fire—are disproportionately low- 
income, elderly, and socioeconomically 
vulnerable. Their homes and their be-
longings were all they had, and now 
they have nothing. 
Even those who did not lose their 
businesses 
to 
the 
fire 
lost 
many 
months of income as evacuations shut 
everything down. The regional econ-
omy will continue to suffer if survivors 
are not able to rebuild. Critical infra-
structure has been either damaged or 
completely 
destroyed, 
including 
schools, fire stations, and the Grizzly 
Flats Post Office. 
While local officials, residents, and 
organizations 
are 
doing 
everything 
they can to provide support to one an-
other and to rebuild, they will not be 
able to recover without the Federal as-
sistance that they desperately need 
and deserve. 
Last year, FEMA denied the request 
for individual assistance for the Creek 
fire in Fresno and Madera counties. 
When I appealed to President Trump to 
correct this injustice, he immediately 
reversed FEMA’s decision and granted 
individual assistance to these home-
owners. 
President 
Biden 
made 
a 
solemn 
promise to the victims of the Caldor 
fire to help them rebuild. He personally 
saw the damage and heartbreak caused 
by the fire. He has the authority to re-
verse FEMA’s denial and fulfill his 
promise. I have now written three let-
ters to him drawing this to his atten-
tion and making this request. So far, I 
have not even received the courtesy of 
a response. 
‘‘We’re going to take care of them, 
and there’s a lot we can do.’’ Those 
were the President’s words spoken to 
these families in September. These 
families have now passed their first 
Thanksgiving without their homes and 
many without their livelihoods that 
were taken from them by this Federal 
fire. They are approaching a dismal 
Christmas, waiting and praying for the 
President to fulfill his promise. 
I appeal to the President to use his 
authority to keep his promise to the 
victims of the Caldor fire. As President 
Trump did for the victims of the Creek 
fire, I call upon him to reverse FEMA’s 
outrageous decision and release the 
funds these families are depending 
upon to rebuild their lives and their 
communities.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Just and merciful God, You have 
promised to open Your gates that the 
righteous nation that keeps the faith 
may enter in. 
Lord, we confess our unrighteousness 
and our faithlessness both as a country 
and as individuals. Show us the paths 
of right behavior and restore our faith 
in You. 
Gracious God, You give peace to 
those whose minds remain fixed on 
You, whose trust in You gives them 
certainty in all life’s challenges. 
Lord, we confess that we have lost 
our sense of purpose and our ability to 
trust anything or anyone, even You. 
Show us the way You would have us go 
and restore our confidence in Your de-
sire as You guide our lives. 
Eternal God, You are our rock and 
our redeemer. 
Lord, we confess that we fail to lean 
on You and instead depend solely on 
our own feeble abilities. Show us the 
strength of Your steadfast love and re-
store to us the promise of Your salva-
tion, that we may enter into Your 
gates with praise and thanksgiving. 
In Your saving name we pray. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6863 
December 2, 2021 
Justin Shilling, Hana St. Juliana, 
Madisyn Baldwin, and Tate Myer, our 
hearts are broken for the families in 
Michigan. 
For the 17 dead and 21 wounded at a 
high school in Columbine 22 years ago; 
for the 32 dead and 17 wounded at Vir-
ginia Tech 14 years ago; for the 27 dead 
and two wounded at an elementary 
school in Newtown, Connecticut, 3,275 
days ago—9 years ago—for the 17 dead 
and 17 wounded at a high school in 
Parkland 3 years ago; and for the four 
dead and seven wounded at a high 
school in Oxford, Michigan, 2 days ago, 
Mr. Speaker, we know what can be 
done to help save lives. 
We know red flags laws are bipar-
tisan and can save lives. We know that 
if we invest in mental health we can 
save lives. We know that background 
checks save lives. These are not par-
tisan, and these are not controversial. 
How many more scenes like the one 
in Michigan do we need to see before 
this Congress, the Senate, this House, 
and the White House get together to 
stop the violence? 
Mr. Speaker, it is urgent. The time 
to act is not now, it was years ago. We 
must come together and help save 
lives. 
f 
RECOGNIZING STUARTS DRAFT 
CHEER 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Stuarts Draft High 
School cheerleading squad. 
After COVID–19 shrank the number of 
teams that could make it to State 
tournament last spring, the Cougars 
fell just 2 points shy of qualifying for 
the 2020 competition. 
Coming off of this defeat and facing 
the loss of nine seniors, the team was 
determined to redeem themselves in 
the 2021 season. After much hard work 
and determination, their efforts paid 
off, winning this year’s Class 2 State 
championship. 
The Cougars dominated the competi-
tion earning a score of 257.5 points with 
their closest competition trailing by 35 
points. With this victory in the books, 
Stuarts Draft Cheer has now claimed 
the State title in 4 of the past 5 years— 
highlighting just how talented this 
team is. 
Following the win, cocaptain Kay- 
Lee Freeman said: 
To not even make it last year then come 
back to win, I just feel so redeemed. People 
said there was no way we were ever going to 
rebuild, but look at us now. 
Congratulations again to the Stuarts 
Draft Cougars on this accomplishment. 
It is well-deserved. 
f 
LET’S FIGHT INFLATION 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge Republicans to join Democrats in 
fighting inflation. 
First, let’s acknowledge that pan-
demic-related disruptions to the global 
supply chain and to consumer demand 
have driven up the price of goods. We 
solve this by vaccinating more people 
here and around the world, restoring 
confidence to high-contact service in-
dustries, and ending this pandemic for 
good. 
Second, let’s help businesses hire. A 
shrunken workforce exacerbates infla-
tion by constraining supply. There are 
27 million hidden workers: Parents who 
took time off, neurodiverse individuals, 
the formerly incarcerated, and people 
without a college degree. 
Passing the Build Back Better Act 
will unlock registered apprenticeships, 
industry-aligned career pathways, and 
other proven job training programs. 
Republicans may have good ideas, 
too, like reducing occupational licens-
ing requirements. They should come 
join the debate in good faith instead of 
scoring political points off of inflation. 
Finally, let’s hold the Fed account-
able to its target of 2 percent inflation. 
Both parties in Congress should hold 
the Fed to account to reduce asset pur-
chases and reestablish its credibility 
on price stability. 
Let’s build on the bipartisan infra-
structure deal to offer bipartisan infla-
tion solutions. 
f 
HONORING HAWKEYE 
DISTINGUISHED VETERANS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor several men and 
women for dedicating their lives to the 
service of this country and to Iowa. 
Recently, three University of Iowa 
alumni, a staff member and a graduate 
student, received the 2021 Hawkeye 
Distinguished Veterans Award for their 
honorable service to this great Nation 
and their continued service to the Uni-
versity of Iowa and the Iowa City com-
munity. 
The recipients of this prestigious 
award are Chaplain George M. Camp-
bell, Jr.; Colonel Kenneth E. Madden; 
Staff Sergeant Maria Guadalupe Bruno; 
General Charles A. Horner; and Staff 
Sergeant Jake L. Schillo. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for these 
wonderful men and women and for 
their service to the United States and 
to Iowa. 
f 
RECKLESS POLICIES DRIVING 
INFLATION 
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, on the heels 
of the most expensive Thanksgiving in 
decades, the American people are head-
ing into the holiday shopping season 
that is going to be the most expensive 
in American history. That is because 
everywhere Americans open their wal-
lets or swipe their credit cards, they 
are paying more because of President 
Biden’s reckless tax, borrow, and spend 
policies. 
Gas prices are up 61 percent from last 
year. 
Think about it, Mr. Speaker, in 1 
year’s time we went from energy domi-
nance to total dependence on foreign 
sources of energy. Electricity prices 
are up nearly 25 percent, and with win-
ter in full swing, the cost of natural 
gas is soaring. Nearly half the homes in 
United States use natural gas for heat, 
and families could pay an average of 
$746 more this winter, 30 percent more 
than a year ago. 
In October, the CPI rose 6.2 percent, 
the highest it has been in over 30 years. 
Core inflation—minus food and energy 
costs—is at 4.3 percent, well above the 
Fed’s 2 percent target. 
Mr. Speaker, the Fed is not meeting 
its price stability mandate, and now 
Democrats want to double down on 
their failed policies of overspending, 
discouraging work, and constraining 
the supply of energy. 
The Build Back Better bill is not 
going to remedy inflation; it is going 
to make it much, much worse. It is 
time for this administration and the 
majority in this Congress to reverse 
course and stop jeopardizing the future 
prosperity of the American people. 
f 
HONORING MARINE CORPORAL 
JOHN ‘‘BULLIT’’ KILLIAN 
(Mr. NORMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and recognize the serv-
ice of Marine Corporal John ‘‘Bullit’’ 
Killian of Chester, South Carolina. 
John is no stranger to service and 
sacrifice. In fact, military service runs 
in the Killian family. John’s father was 
a marine in World War II in the Pacific 
Theater. 
A true American hero, John bravely 
served our country throughout the 
Vietnam war. John’s military career 
began in 1965 after he and several of his 
classmates were selected for the draft. 
John went through basic training at 
Parris Island, which he credits for suf-
ficiently preparing him to survive 
Vietnam. His first duty station was 
Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) in 
Cherry Point, North Carolina, where he 
trained as an electrician and attended 
an air conditioning and refrigeration 
school. 
After completing his schooling, John 
shipped out to Vietnam. He was based 
at Camp Evans, which he and his fellow 
marines 
called 
Disneyland 
because 
they got to live in hooches instead of 
tents. 
Affectionately known as Cackalack, 
John was discharged after 1 year, 11

months, and 22 days in the Marine 
Corps. He left Vietnam the day the Tet 
Offensive started. His time in the Ma-
rine Corps dramatically affected his 
life. John said in some ways his service 
made him harder, but in other ways 
softer. 
On behalf of the Fifth District of 
South Carolina, I want to thank Ma-
rine Corporal John Killian for his out-
standing service. He has created a last-
ing legacy of duty, honor, and courage, 
and our Nation is better off for his sac-

WE MUST RESTORE AMERICAN 
COMPETITIVENESS 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because I refuse to stand by and 
watch as America’s ability to ensure 
the safe and efficient movement of 
goods, people, and services throughout 
our transportation network continues 
to be diluted. Our priority focus right 
now should be strengthening our Na-
tion’s economy and increasing our 
global competitiveness. 
The policies of this President and 
Democratic Party leaders in Congress 
are exacerbating or simply ignoring 
the underlying supply chain crisis. 
These policies include the mishandling 
of the COVID response in ways that are 
prolonging unemployment and worker 
shortages across the economy and 
pushing 
for 
a 
multitrillion-dollar 
spending spree that is driving up prices 
of everything from gas to groceries. 
Mr. Speaker, these efforts only serve 
to weaken American competitiveness 
and shrink our economy. 
f 
HONORING THE REMARKABLE CA-
REER OF DR. KAREN A. BOWYER 
(Mr. KUSTOFF asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a true education 
leader, Dyersburg State Community 
College President Dr. Karen A. Bowyer. 
Dr. Karen Bowyer has served as presi-
dent of Dyersburg State Community 
College, located in my congressional 
district, for 37 years, and was the first 
female president to lead the institu-
tion. In fact, at that time there were 
no female college presidents in the en-
tire State of Tennessee. 
Indeed, Dr. Bowyer broke barriers, 
and she opened doors for students and 
their families across west Tennessee to 
achieve a higher education. Under 
Karen 
Bowyer, 
enrollment 
at 
Dyersburg State grew by more than 100 
percent during her tenure. 
The impact that Karen Bowyer has 
had on our community in west Ten-
nessee is absolutely immeasurable. We 
thank Karen Bowyer for her service, 
and Roberta and I wish her the best in 
her well-deserved retirement. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE 80TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the 80th anniversary of National Bible 
Week. In 1941, weeks before the United 
States entered World War II, President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the 
week of Thanksgiving as National 
Bible Week. 
This celebration recognizes the spir-
itual and historical significance of the 
Bible. It is a week where we can come 
together and celebrate this holy book. 
The Bible has shaped our Nation’s his-
tory and continues to provide guidance 
to the lives of so many. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to live in 
a country where we can freely read the 
Scripture and worship the Lord with-
out fear of persecution. The Bible is 
timeless and continues to provide us 
with words of wisdom, comfort, and 
guidance as we navigate unprecedented 
times. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to leave you with this verse from 2 
Timothy 3:16. It is one that I keep close 
to my heart. 
All Scripture is breathed out by God and 
profitable for teaching, for reproof, for cor-
rection, and for training in righteousness, 
that the man of God may be complete, 
equipped for every good work.

HONORING THE LIVES OF DARIN 
JOHNS AND MARC BOSWELL 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my deepest condolences 
and prayers to the families of Darin 
Johns and Marc Boswell, who were 
tragically killed in a bus crash while 
traveling 
with 
the 
Andrews 
High 
School band. 
Darin Johns, the beloved band direc-
tor, was an active member of the An-
drews community who dedicated his 
life to his faith and his beloved wife, 
Karen, and their family and friends, 
and who invested in younger genera-
tions as a band director for over 30 
years. 
He lent all of his time and energy to 
building up the dreams and talents of 
those around him. 
I also want to recognize Marc Bos-
well, a humble and beloved Andrews 
public servant. Marc devoted his life to 
Andrews as a high school math teach-
er, was an employee of the Andrews 
school district, and was involved in the 
community as a leader and as a friend. 
He was known for his servant heart, 
his incredible work ethic, his infec-
tious smile, and his deep love for his 
wife, Carol, and their children and 
grandchildren. 
Mr. Speaker, Camille and I are send-
ing our support and our prayers, not 
only to the families of those who were 
tragically killed, but also to the entire 
community and Andrews High School.

EXEMPT CRITICAL WORKERS 
FROM VACCINE REQUIREMENTS 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, our 
country is in a time of crisis. President 
Biden’s policies have broken our supply 
chain; caused nationwide shortages and 
delays; and now, President Biden is 
holding the workers who keep our 
country running hostage through his 
vaccine mandates, further threatening 
our economic stability. 
Federal employees throughout cen-
tral Washington who operate and pro-
tect critical facilities are facing termi-
nation over what should be a personal 
medical decision. They don’t deserve to 
be fired. 
That is why I introduced the Exemp-
tions for Critical Workers Act, to en-
sure these critical workers, who kept 
our industries functioning long before 
a vaccine was available to them, can 
make the health decision that is right 
for them while continuing their impor-
tant work. 
Just this week, three Federal courts 
halted the administration’s mandate in 
certain 
parts 
of 
the 
country 
for 
healthcare workers and Federal con-
tractors. Clearly, these mandates are 
unconstitutional. 
I stand with the men and women who 
were asked to stand on the front lines 
for our sake, and I urge my colleagues 
to support my legislation. 
f 
ABORTION NOT A FUNDAMENTAL 
RIGHT 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday, our U.S. Supreme Court Jus-
tices held oral arguments in the Dobbs 
v. Jackson case, which addressed the 
constitutionality of Mississippi’s law 
banning abortions after 15 weeks. 
It is time to get rid of the rules that 
prevent our legislators from enacting 
the will of the people and passing laws 
to protect the unborn, Mr. Speaker. 
Chief Justice John Roberts once ar-
gued that the right to abortion has ‘‘no 
support in the text, structure, or his-
tory of the Constitution.’’ I pray he 
and the eight other Justices uphold 
that view in Dobbs v. Jackson. They 
know the ability to murder unborn 
children is not one of our fundamental 
rights. 
The Biden administration suspended 
basic healthcare regulations so doctors

could pass out abortion pills like 
candy, Mr. Speaker. It is time for our 
third branch of government to step up 
now, show some common sense, and 
make the right decision to protect mil-
lions of our unborn babies. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, I always re-
member a story that happened shortly 
before my momma left this Earth. She 
was in hospice, and she started talking 
to folks that had passed a long time be-
fore her: my daddy, her daddy, her 
brother who died in the Second World 
War. She was looking off at one point, 
and I said: ‘‘What are you looking at, 
Momma?’’ And she said: ‘‘Baby, I am 
looking at all of those sweet little ba-
bies over there.’’ 
I can’t help but think some of those 
sweet little babies my sweet momma 
was looking at were some of the un-
born that were murdered in abortion.

ECONOMIC CRISIS—RISING 
INFLATION 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, our Thanks-
giving celebration for this year is in 
the rearview mirror, but the rising in-
flation that drove dinner costs higher 
this year is sticking around for Christ-
mas and will continue to crush house-
hold budgets into the new year. 
From the grocery store to the gas 
pump, Americans across the board are 
paying more for just about everything. 
No matter where you may fall on the 
income spectrum, none of us can escape 
paying more for less. However, lower 
income households and the elderly who 
are on fixed incomes will be hit hardest 
by the pain that inflation always in-
flicts. 
What is driving the skyrocketing in-
flation? Wasteful and increased Federal 
spending that encourages workers to 
remain on the sidelines, supply chain 
shortages, and transportation disrup-
tions are to blame. 
Americans are not stupid. That is 
why a majority say that President 
Biden’s 
multitrillion-dollar 
socialist 
tax-and-spend scheme will only make 
bad inflation worse, not better.

CONGRATULATING YOUNG HARRIS 
COLLEGE MEN’S SOCCER TEAM 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate and cel-
ebrate the continued accomplishments 
of Young Harris College Men’s Soccer 
team. 
On November 14, the team rallied to-
gether to defeat Clayton State, secur-
ing their sixth Peach Belt Conference 
title in program history. 
Furthermore, this victory advanced 
the team to the NCAA Division II Na-
tional Tournament. Entering the tour-
nament with a 17–0-1 record, the Moun-
tain Lions continued to dominate with 
a 2–1 win over the Clayton State 
Lakers for the title. 
The team is now set to face off 
against Auburn University at Mont-
gomery on December 2 in the quarter-
finals of the Division II tournament. 
These student athletes are to be cele-
brated for their spirit of unrelenting 
perseverance. Their hard work, dedica-
tion, and determination will be an ex-
ample future teams will strive to emu-
late. 
I extend my congratulations to the 
entire YHC Men’s Soccer program for 
their remarkable season and am proud 
of my alma mater. Go Mountain Lions.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H.R. 6119, FURTHER EXTEND-
ING GOVERNMENT FUNDING ACT; 
AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, by direction of the Com-
mittee on Rules, I call up House Reso-
lution 829 and ask for its immediate 
consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 829 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 6119) making further 
continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2022, and for other pur-
poses. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations or their respective designees; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 2. Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule 
XX, further proceedings on a vote by the 
yeas and nays on the question of adoption of 
a motion that the House suspend the rules 
offered on the legislative day of November 
30, 2021, or December 1, 2021, may be post-
poned through the legislative day of Decem-
ber 10, 2021. 
SEC. 3. House Resolution 188, agreed to 
March 8, 2021 (as most recently amended by 
House Resolution 774, agreed to November 5, 
2021), is amended by striking ‘‘December 3, 
2021’’ each place it appears and inserting (in 
each instance) ″January 21, 2022’’. 
SEC. 4. Notwithstanding section 3 of this 
resolution, on any legislative day of the sec-
ond session of the One Hundred Seventeenth 
Congress before January 10, 2022— 
(a) the Speaker may dispense with organi-
zational and legislative business; and 
(b) the Journal of the proceedings of the 
previous day shall be considered as approved 
if applicable. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, for the purpose of debate 
only, I yield the customary 30 minutes 
to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
COLE), pending which I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members be given 5 legislative days 
to revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, today the Rules Committee 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 829. The rule provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6119 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations and 
one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides that requested 
roll call votes on suspension bills con-
sidered on November 30, December 1, or 
December 2 may be postponed through 
December 10. 
Finally, the rule provides for recess 
instruction suspension authority and 
same-day authority through January 
21, 2022, and allowing the House to con-
vene the second session of the 117th 
Congress on January 10, 2022. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
consider a continuing resolution to 
keep our government open and oper-
ating for the American people. A con-
tinuing resolution will allow the Ap-
propriations Committee to complete 
its work on full-year appropriation 
bills and provide needed funding to 
many critical programs that help our 
small businesses, our veterans, our 
local governments, and so much more. 
It is, frankly, a bit disturbing that 
we need a structured rule for this very 
basic function. I think it speaks vol-
umes that the other side seems unin-
terested in engaging in our most essen-
tial responsibilities. I would say I was 
surprised but, sadly, this appears to be 
just another step in a long line of at-
tempts to undermine needed account-
ability and investment this year. 
In September, we passed a continuing 
resolution to keep the government 
open until December 3 and allow for 
the House and Senate to negotiate om-
nibus government funding legislation. 
The other side has so far refused to 
negotiate for full-year funding bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6866 
December 2, 2021 
They have refused to be responsible 
with the programs that so many of our 
constituents depend upon. 
As a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, I know firsthand the im-
pact that a lack of full-year funding 
will have. 
Without full-year funding, we will 
not be able to help the VA reduce its 
backlog to help our veterans and their 
families. 
We will not be able to provide our 
military with the funding to promote 
readiness, and we won’t be able to pro-
vide a badly needed pay raise for our 
troops. 
We also won’t be able to help our 
small businesses, who continue to 
struggle because of the pandemic. 
Those problems may be acceptable to 
the other side, but not to Democrats. 
As the economy continues to recover 
from the pandemic, this bill will ensure 
that we can keep the government open 
and avoid the disastrous consequences 
of the Republican-led 2018–2019 shut-
down. 
In the meantime, we hope Repub-
licans will start the process of offering 
constructive proposals to address the 
critical issues facing our country. Our 
constituents deserve that much at the 
very least. I look forward to that dis-
cussion when it does occur. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
TORRES), my good friend and not only 
fellow member of the Rules Com-
mittee, but fellow appropriator, for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule covers one 
item, a continuing resolution to fund 
the government and keep it open and 
operating through February 18, 2022. 
While I am grateful that we are tak-
ing steps to avoid a government shut-
down, I am disappointed by the solu-
tion before us, yet another short-term 
funding bill with full-year funding ne-
gotiations no closer than they were a 
few months ago or a few weeks ago. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s resolution is 
the second continuing resolution we 
have had to pass to cover fiscal year 
2022. Sadly, I expect it will not be the 
last. This state of affairs was abso-
lutely avoidable and reflects poorly on 
the Democratic leadership. 
I have often said that government 
funding is the most fundamental re-
sponsibility 
of 
Congress. 
Unfortu-
nately, we are nowhere close to a full- 
year appropriation funding deal. We 
are no closer to an agreement today 
than the last time we passed a con-
tinuing resolution in September. The 
reality is that the reason we are having 
to consider another continuing resolu-
tion today is because of the majority’s 
insistence on focusing on partisan pri-
orities rather than on the critical busi-
ness of governing the nation. 
b 1245 
For months, the majority’s focus has 
not been anywhere near where it 
should have been. Instead of reaching a 
full-year deal on government funding 
or even a top-line agreement on fund-
ing levels, the majority has insisted on 
working on other partisan matters. 
Since the passage of the last stop-gap 
funding measure, House Democrats 
have focused solely on their massive 
reconciliation bill, month after month, 
focused on enshrining partisan policies 
into law. These efforts may satisfy 
their progressive base, but they fail the 
American people as a whole. 
The majority currently controls the 
House, the Senate, and the Presidency, 
and if they can swing the votes, they 
can pass whatever they want into law. 
But with that ability also comes a 
grave responsibility, a responsibility to 
govern the country. Unfortunately, the 
majority has been abandoning that re-
sponsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, October 1 marked the 
beginning of fiscal year 2022. By rights, 
the House and the Senate should have 
both passed our standard 12 appropria-
tions bills through both Chambers of 
Congress and into law by that date. 
But since we did not, a continuing res-
olution was necessary. 
Now we are on the second continuing 
resolution of this fiscal year, and in all 
likelihood, a probable third one is com-
ing in February, unless my friends on 
the other side actually start negoti-
ating in earnest. At this point, we are 
unfortunately no closer to passing 
these 12 bills or an omnibus spending 
bill than we were back on October 1. 
This is truly a failure to govern. 
While the majority focuses on a push 
to make the government bigger and 
bigger, they are failing to fund the gov-
ernment which already exists today. 
What happens as a result? We move 
from continuing resolution to con-
tinuing resolution, getting no closer to 
a final spending deal. Not involving Re-
publicans until the very last minute 
and just expecting us to indefinitely 
support CR after CR is no way to gov-
ern, and frankly, the failure to have 
any conversations about how to come 
to an agreement on a full-year appro-
priations bill is indefensible. 
While I am sure former President 
Trump will be pleased to know his last 
budget continues on almost a year 
after he left office, there is real work 
that can and should be done. 
But what is perhaps the most frus-
trating has been the way in which the 
majority has bungled reaching a rel-
atively simple deal on this particular 
continuing resolution. Knowing full 
well that this Friday’s deadline was 
coming 
up, 
the 
majority 
instead 
dithered for months on their reconcili-
ation package. 
This week, finally acknowledging 
that real discussions needed to be had 
with Republicans, the majority instead 
continued to twiddle their thumbs. In-
deed, Republicans in the House were 
completely shut out of this process, 
leaving us all in the dark about the na-
ture of today’s bill until this morning. 
Once again, the majority has chosen to 
go it alone rather than choosing to 
work across the aisle. 
The majority is well aware that their 
current stance on a larger deal is dead 
on arrival in the Senate. As long as 
they continue to insist on omitting the 
historically bipartisan pro-life protec-
tions which have existed in law for 
more than 45 years, Republicans can-
not and will not support bills that end 
these protections, and the Senate will 
not pass them. 
But that is not the only point of dis-
agreement. The majority has been un-
willing to fund our Nation’s defense at 
the levels agreed to by the authorizers 
and appropriators in the House and 
currently being debated in the Senate. 
These increased levels are necessary to 
ensure 
continued 
defense 
readiness 
worldwide, especially given the ongo-
ing tensions in places like Eastern Eu-
rope, the Middle East, Afghanistan, 
and the Taiwan Strait. 
But instead of governing and seeking 
to address these challenges, the major-
ity is pandering to the most extreme 
elements of their Caucus, trying des-
perately to pass bills that lower de-
fense spending levels and omitting key 
bipartisan pro-life protections from ap-
propriations bills. And instead of gov-
erning, the majority holds the Amer-
ican people hostage under the threat of 
a government shutdown, dragging the 
country from one self-inflicted crisis to 
another. 
Mr. Speaker, the sooner the majority 
gets serious about reaching a full-year 
deal, the better for the country. There 
are real, damaging consequences to the 
failure to pass full-year appropriations 
bills, both at home and abroad, and the 
sooner the majority brings its atten-
tion back to the critical business of 
governing the country, the better off 
we all will be. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I once again state that the failure of 
not being able to pass a timely budget 
lies at the feet of the Republican 
Party. They have refused to come to 
the table with actual fair negotiations. 
If my colleagues across the aisle 
want to have a debate on a woman’s 
right to choose what to do with their 
bodies, then I would welcome that. 
I would also welcome a debate on 
issues like gun violence. If we care 
about life and we say that we are pro- 
life, we should be pro-life for everyone, 
including our high school students that 
are suffering every single day at the 
hands of the failure of this Republican 
Party to come to the table. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment on the rule to 
immediately bring up H.R. 6056, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6867 
December 2, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, education is one of the 
most important issues that we face 
today. Determining how our children 
will be educated determines the future 
fate of our Nation. 
Unfortunately, many school districts 
have been ignoring the wishes of par-
ents or, worse, telling parents they 
cannot play a role in their child’s edu-
cation. 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate 
Terry McAuliffe made Democrats’ posi-
tion on education clear when he said: 
‘‘I don’t think parents should be telling 
schools what they should teach.’’ I 
couldn’t disagree with him more, and 
thankfully, neither could Virginia vot-
ers. 
Instead, H.R. 6056, developed by Edu-
cation and Labor Committee Repub-
licans, would enshrine a list of rights 
into law to make clear to parents what 
their rights are and clear to schools 
what their duties to parents are. 
These rights include the right to 
know what their children are being 
taught, the right of parents to be 
heard, and the right to protect their 
child’s privacy. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Lou-
isiana (Ms. LETLOW), the sponsor of 
H.R. 6056 and a member of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee. 
Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the previous question so we can 
immediately take up H.R. 6056, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. 
As a mom of two and a former educa-
tor, I can tell you from firsthand expe-
rience that education is not something 
that can happen without parents play-
ing a role. The learning process re-
quires both sides to work together and 
have collaborative partnerships that 
ensure a student’s success. 
Parents should not have a system of 
values and beliefs forced on their chil-
dren or send them to school while fear-
ing indoctrination by a political agen-
da. The idea that government can ex-
clude parents and have total control of 
the classroom will never work because 
it ignores the simple truth that these 
are our children, not the government’s. 
The Parents Bill of Rights Act puts 
safeguards in place that ensure that 
the foundation of education is built on 
a meaningful dialogue between a fam-
ily and their child’s school. This bill 
has five core principles that are de-
signed to create mutually beneficial 
partnerships and lead to greater col-
laboration. 
Those five principles are: one, par-
ents have the right to review their 
school’s curriculum, reading materials, 
and State academic standards; two, 
parents have the right to lawfully en-
gage with their local school board and 
educators; three, parents have the 
right to see a school’s budget and 
spending, including detailed informa-
tion about revenues and expenditures; 
four, parents have the right to protect 
their child’s privacy; and, finally, par-
ents have the right to keep their child 
safe and be updated on any violent ac-
tivity at school. 
The ideas contained in this bill are 
not partisan or polarizing; they are 
simple and common sense. In my home 
State of Louisiana, a similar parents 
bill of rights passed with broad support 
from both Republicans and Democrats, 
and I hope we can follow suit here in 
Congress. 
Several weeks ago, Louisiana’s State 
Superintendent of Education, Dr. Cade 
Brumley, wrote about how family in-
volvement is critical for educational 
success. He said: ‘‘It takes a family to 
raise a child. Schools exist to support 
that effort with a responsibility to pro-
vide a quality education in a safe envi-
ronment.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we have the oppor-
tunity today in this body to take a step 
forward for America’s families, and I 
hope my colleagues across the aisle 
will join us in that effort. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I welcome a healthy debate on the fu-
ture of our children while they are in 
school. A healthy debate will also in-
clude a responsible code of conduct, 
basic 
respect, 
and 
accountability 
issues. 
It would also include accepting the 
fact that our children every single day 
are subject to gun violence, but yet, 
conspiracy theories in full display in 
Congress continue to deny our children 
and their parents the safety that they 
are demanding. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. OWENS), my good friend and rank-
ing member of the Early Childhood, El-
ementary, and Secondary Education 
Subcommittee, for further explanation 
of the previous question. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider H.R. 6056, 
the Parents Bill of Rights Act. 
As a father of six children and a 
grandfather of 15, I know from experi-
ence that parents who are informed 
and engaged are always the best advo-
cates for their own children. 
I also grew up in a home with teach-
ers. My dad was a college professor for 
40 years, and my mom was a junior 
high school teacher. 
Recent attempts to discredit the role 
of parents and to silence their genuine 
concerns should be very concerning to 
every American. There has never been 
a time more important than now to 
stand with and for America’s parents. 
I have heard directly from Utah’s 
moms and dads. They don’t want Wash-
ington bureaucrats and career politi-
cians dictating the decisions that de-
termine the education, development, 
health, and well-being of their chil-
dren. They want and deserve a say. 
Democrats’ and the leftist teachers 
unions’ efforts to nationalize edu-
cation, mandate curriculum, and im-
pose one-size-fits-all models from D.C., 
while ignoring the will of teachers, par-
ents, and students, have been ex-
tremely harmful. 
This last year, we have seen the aca-
demic and emotional needs of young 
learners totally ignored. Keeping our 
children out of the classroom went 
against the science. It also went 
against good old-fashioned common 
sense. 
Here are some sobering facts. During 
the 2020 through 2021 school year, stu-
dents fell behind an average of 5 
months in math and 4 months in read-
ing. Low-income and minority children 
fell an additional 1 to 2 months behind 
their White and wealthy peers. 
Even before the pandemic in 2017, the 
United States Department of Edu-
cation found that 75 percent of Black 
boys in the State of California failed to 
pass standard reading and writing 
tests. In 2019, only 15 percent of Balti-
more eighth grade students were pro-
ficient in reading, and about 10 percent 
were proficient in math. 
This is beyond politics and party 
lines. It is about the future of our great 
Nation. It is about the success of our 
children. 
There is an urgent need to raise the 
bar of education in our country. We 
cannot do this by pushing parents out 
of the driver’s seat and ignoring aca-
demic needs for our students. Our Par-
ents Bill of Rights will address both 
concerns. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Continuing conspiracy theories, the 
big lie, drove thousands of Americans 
to come to the U.S. Capitol in a violent 
attempt to overthrow our government. 
In full display today, once again we 
have Republicans that are continuing 
with their conspiracy theories about 
what is and isn’t happening on our 
school grounds. 
Well, let me tell you what is hap-
pening in some of the schools in my 
district. 
For the very first time, under the 
Biden administration, children have 
access to healthy food. They have food 
programs. They are learning how to 
grow their own food. 
For the very first time, families that 
spend hours driving to and from work, 
hardworking parents, have the relief of 
knowing that childcare is available for 
their children. 
This is what is at stake today, the 
real issues of what is happening and 
not happening in our schools and ac-
cess to education. It doesn’t just take a 
healthy family to raise a child. In the 
words of the former first lady, some-
times it takes a village.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6868 
December 2, 2021 
Vote on this CR. Fund the govern-
ment and continue to fund healthy pro-
grams that help our children thrive in 
their schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), my very 
good friend and the ranking member of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor, for further explanation on the 
previous question. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Oklahoma for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question so we can 
bring up H.R. 6056, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act. 
There has been a push to silence par-
ents around the country. Powerful 
teachers unions, several school boards, 
Democrat politicians, and the Biden 
Justice Department have all voiced op-
position to the rights of parents to 
have a say in their child’s education. 
We will not stand for this kind of in-
timidation, and we will not tolerate 
the left’s attempt to push parents out 
of the decisionmaking process when it 
comes to their child’s education. 
That is why we have introduced the 
Parents Bill of Rights. This legislation 
will protect rights parents already 
have but that are now under attack. 
I can’t imagine why anyone would 
oppose the Parents Bill of Rights Act. 
Making 
school 
spending 
and 
cur-
riculum transparent should already be 
the norm. After all, what do schools 
have to hide? 
This bill will also ensure that schools 
do not share or sell private student 
data or attempt to administer health 
examinations without parental con-
sent. These are extremely important 
decisions that belong to parents, not 
bureaucrats or school administrators. 
The left’s assault on parental rights 
is outrageous. To claim that parents 
are akin to domestic terrorists just be-
cause they don’t agree with the left’s 
agenda is beyond the pale. Yet, it is 
these very attacks that have shown 
Americans all around the country just 
how important it is to stand up to the 
left. We cannot let our fundamental 
rights be stripped from us, especially 
the right to raise our children. 
This bill is ushering in a new era of 
education, one where parents won’t 
take a back seat to the system. One 
thing is certain, our children and the 
country will be better off for having 
the Parents Bill of Rights. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, by continuing to pro-
mote conspiracy theories and refusing 
to come to the table to talk about the 
real issues that we are funding here 
today, the Republicans in Congress 
continue to deny parents and children 
the education that they need by con-
tinuing to deny healthy food programs, 
once again. 
So let’s focus on what is healthy and 
not healthy for our children. Con-
tinuing to drink the Kool-Aid that led 
thousands of people to hurt our U.S. 
Capitol Police officers, to beat them 
with our own American flag, that is 
what they are selling here today. 
We need to work on a budget for the 
people. This is the people’s House. That 
is why they voted for us to come to 
Congress. Let’s focus on the real issues 
and not play into the political theater 
that is being offered here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill in front of us, in 
some ways, is a simple bill. It is a con-
tinuing resolution. It goes for a certain 
amount of time. Sadly, it reflects the 
basic failure of this institution to focus 
on its job. 
We have had more than a year to deal 
with what we should be dealing with, 
the passage of the budget. We ex-
tended—I actually voted for the exten-
sion—the last continuing resolution to 
provide time. 
Now, my friends knew at the begin-
ning of this process the number of 
things that they had to do. They knew 
if they took out the Hyde language and 
those protections that they would 
never get a deal. Yet, they did that 
anyway. 
They did that without consultation. 
They did it in committee. They had the 
votes. They had every right to do it. 
They also knew at the end of the day 
they were going to have to have bipar-
tisanship on appropriations bills. They 
will not pass in the Senate because of 
the filibuster. There is sufficient sup-
port on both sides of the aisle. 
Every 
single 
Republican 
in 
this 
Chamber actually supported the re-
insertion of the Hyde amendment in 
the legislative process, telling our 
friends: If you take this out, we are not 
going to be working with you until it is 
restored. 
So far, we have not seen any effort to 
do that. 
Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other 
side also put in lots of poison pills— 
again, lots of things that they knew 
Republicans would not accept. That is 
fine in a reconciliation package. They 
really don’t need our votes. That is not 
true in an appropriations bill. 
It is my understanding that both 
ranking members in both Chambers on 
the Committee on Appropriations said: 
Look, we are not sitting down to nego-
tiate until the Hyde protections are 
back in. 
They 
are 
historically 
bipartisan. 
They have been there 45 years. Most of 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle have voted for them over and over 
and over again, whether they liked 
them or not. 
Frankly, if you are going to have to 
get a bipartisan deal, when you put 
partisan pills in, you know you are 
going to have to take them out at some 
point. You might as well do it at the 
beginning of the session. 
We also have had no engagement 
from either the administration or our 
friends on the other side about any 
spending limits whatsoever. What is 
our top-line number? Nobody has been 
willing to sit down and talk about 
that. Quite frankly, that is a problem. 
Mr. Speaker, we probably ought to be 
looking at that, as we have done in pre-
vious years over multiple years going 
forward. We could also make adjust-
ments if we are in a crisis. We have 
done that before. But we had a frame-
work that we could operate under, and 
it has actually facilitated the appro-
priations. I would recommend to my 
friends that might be something they 
want to talk about with both sides. 
But in the end, the deal here is not 
hard to see. The deal involves three 
simple things. There are lots of details, 
lots of other things to be negotiated. 
First, defense spending is going to 
have to come up. That is not just Re-
publicans telling you that. The Demo-
cratic-controlled House Committee on 
Armed Services and the Democratic- 
controlled 
Senate 
Committee 
on 
Armed Services both put in $25 billion 
more than in the President’s base 
budget or in the bill that our friends 
passed out of committee but never 
brought to this floor because they 
don’t have the votes to pass it. So that 
is one. 
Number two, my friends, in the 12 
bills that they have passed through the 
Committee on Appropriations—and I 
commend them for that—raised domes-
tic spending by 17 or 18 percent. That 
number is going to have to come down. 
We can talk about how much, and we 
can talk about where, but it is way too 
much, and it is way out of balance. 
And number three—and my friends 
were told this over and over and over 
again—if you take out the Hyde protec-
tions on life, there will be no Repub-
lican votes for your bill. Now, we can 
pass continuing resolution after con-
tinuing resolution. After all, that is 
Donald Trump’s last negotiated budg-
et, the budget you got when you had a 
Republican President, Republican Sen-
ate, and a Democratic House. 
Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, many of 
my friends on my side of the aisle 
would prefer that. I would prefer a 
deal. I would prefer a more robust de-
fense budget. I am willing to talk 
about some of my friends’ domestic pri-
orities—quite frankly, some of which I 
share and would support and have in 
the past. I am also, though, not pre-
pared to yield on the Hyde amendment, 
and my friends know that. 
Mr. Speaker, we know what a deal is: 
more defense; less domestic spending; 
removal of poison pills; restoration of 
historic, bipartisan protections on life. 
Do those things and we can have a 
deal, I think, pretty quickly. Stay 
where you are at and we will not have 
a deal, and we will be right back here 
in February, doing another continuing 
resolution. 
The most basic responsibility of Con-
gress is to fund the government. Unfor-
tunately, we are no closer to a full-

year spending deal that we truly need. 
My colleagues in the majority have 
wasted months focusing on other mat-
ters—notably, a wildly expensive and 
unrealistic 
reconciliation 
spending 
package—rather than doing the hard 
and essential work of governing the 
Nation. I urge my friends in the major-
ity to rethink that course. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H.R. 6119, FURTHER EXTEND-
ING GOVERNMENT FUNDING ACT; 
AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). The gentleman from Okla-
homa has yielded back. The gentle-
woman from California is recognized to 
close. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
We have just witnessed, once again, 
that the other side of the aisle has 
zero—zero—interest in governing. Zero. 
Republicans apparently have no inter-
est in leading and zero—no agenda on 
how to lead. Zero. 
Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to 
make sure that the programs that our 
constituents depend on will be able to 
continue. Democrats are trying to 
make sure that our troops—you know, 
the ones that you claim to support— 
have the resources to defend our coun-
try, to defend the Constitution that 
you have sworn to defend. 
Democrats are trying to make sure 
that our hospitals and our health clin-
ics have the resources to help those 
who are sick with COVID. You can boo 
all you want, but many of you have 
continued to spread this pandemic by 
refusing to wear a mask. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, we are seeing a full display of

the political theater that the Repub-
licans bring to Congress. Zero. 
Madam Speaker, as we saw in the 
last vote, Republicans just want to go 
home. They just want to go home. 
Democrats are here for the people. We 
need to keep the government open. We 
need to work on full-year funding bills 
to address the critical challenges that 
our Nation faces. Democrats are here 
to lead. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the CR. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 829 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6056) to ensure the rights of parents are hon-
ored and protected in the Nation’s public 
schools. All point of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions of the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one house of debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor; and (2) one motion 
to recommit. 
SEC. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6056. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time, and I move the previous ques-
tion on the resolution.

December 2, 2021 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, before I go any fur-
ther, I would first like to take a mo-
ment to mourn the loss of Congress-
woman Carrie Meek. She was an ex-
traordinary force in the Congress and a 
pioneer who was never deterred by any 
challenge that came her way. I like to 
say that though she was unassuming 
and soft-spoken, she carried a big 
stick. That is evident in her enduring 
legacy today. I had the honor of serv-
ing 
together 
with 
Congresswoman 
Meek on the Appropriations Com-
mittee years ago, and I feel immensely 
privileged to have worked with her to 
help expand opportunity for all Ameri-
cans. We all mourn her loss. 
Madam Speaker, I will be frank. In-
stead of being here today discussing 
another continuing resolution, I wish 
that we were here to present a bipar-
tisan, bicameral appropriations agree-
ment. Continuing resolutions are not 
the way to govern. They are a short- 
term patch that leaves the American 
people behind. But we are here today 
because my colleagues across the aisle 
have refused time and time again to 
begin negotiations or even offer a pro-
posal of their own for government 
funding that delivers for the American 
people. 
House and Senate Democrats have 
put forward their proposals, but Repub-
licans have not presented an offer of 
their own. There is not one piece of 
paper 
describing 
what 
Republicans 
want. It has been 30 days since I 
brought together a bipartisan, bi-
cameral four-corners meeting on No-
vember 2, and to date we have not 
heard one word from them—not one 
word. 
But now my Republican counterparts 
want more time—something that they 
have had since we came to this floor to 
pass the last funding extension 62 days 
ago, which means we now have no 
choice but to pursue a short-term ex-
tension. Make no mistake, Madam 
Speaker, a vote against this continuing 
resolution is a vote to shut the govern-
ment down. 
The legislation before us, the Further 
Extending Government Funding Act, 
continues government funding at cur-
rent levels through February 18. It 
makes minimal changes to address the 
most urgent of needs during the period 
of the continuing resolution and pro-
vides $7 billion to continue supporting 
Afghanistan evacuees after the end of 
20 years of war. 
While I wish the February 18 end date 
were earlier—and I pursued earlier 
dates—I believe this agreement allows 
the appropriations process to move for-
ward toward a final funding agreement 
that addresses the needs of the Amer-
ican people. 
Let me be clear, working families, 
small businesses, veterans, and our 
military need the certainty that comes 
with passing omnibus funding legisla-
tion instead of short-term funding 
patches. Republicans must join us for 
bipartisan, bicameral negotiations to 
resolve our differences and keep gov-
ernment working for us all. 
For our communities, we need an om-
nibus to create and sustain good-pay-
ing jobs, support small businesses, pre-
vent future pandemics, and advance 
lifesaving medical research. We need 
an 
omnibus 
to 
strengthen 
public 
schools, protect our air and water, 
combat the opioid epidemic, and sup-
port core services such as food safety 
and 
consumer 
product 
inspections. 
Without an omnibus, investments in 
all these areas will be denied. 
For our veterans, we need an omni-
bus to provide sufficient funding for 
veterans’ benefits, reduce backlogs for 
veterans and their families, and meet 
the needs of the VA’s healthcare sys-
tem. Without an omnibus there will be 
a shortfall that will cause veterans not 
to receive their benefits in full. 
For our national security, we need an 
omnibus to support defense readiness 
and modernization, secure our cyber 
infrastructure, and strengthen Amer-
ican leadership abroad. Without an om-
nibus, a pay raise for troops will not be 
funded while funds will be misdirected 
to a war we are no longer fighting. 
As I said before, I wanted to be here 
today passing a bipartisan, bicameral 
appropriations agreement. Sadly, we 
are not. But as Republicans take the 
next 21⁄2
months, Democrats remain 
ready, willing, and able to move this 
process forward. We are ready to go, 
but we need willing partners to put the 
American people first. 
With a new deadline of February 18, 
it is long past time for our Republican 
colleagues to offer constructive pro-
posals to address the critical issues fac-
ing the country by funding the Federal 
Government’s important work. As the 
American people put their faith and 
trust in us, they deserve no less. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
speak on H.R. 6119, a short-term con-
tinuing resolution through February 
18. I must admit that I am disappointed 
to be on the floor of the House today to 
speak about a continuing resolution 
rather than full-year appropriations 
bills. But earlier this year, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
crafted fiscal year 2022 bills with little 
input from Republicans, and we have 
not been able to find a path forward. 
During markups this summer, our 
Members made it clear we would not 
support partisan bills that include irre-
sponsible spending increases and ex-
treme policies. Unfortunately, that is 
exactly where we find ourselves. 
The House and Senate bills were 
drafted to top-line spending levels that 
do not reflect a bipartisan consensus. 
The majority party also focused fund-
ing on their own priorities with non-
defense spending increasing at a much 
higher rate than defense spending. And 
last, but certainly not least, the poli-
cies in the bills are the most extreme 
that I have seen since I became a mem-
ber of the Appropriations Committee. 
During 2019 and 2020, there were also 
strong differences of opinions, but we 
had an agreement in place that allowed 
us to negotiate final bills quickly. The 
terms were rather simple. The party 
leaders and the White House reached 
early 
agreement 
on 
the 
spending 
framework. Everyone agreed to drop 
controversial 
language 
and 
restore 
longstanding provisions unless all sides 
agreed to changes. I am concerned that 
we cannot have meaningful discussions 
on full-year appropriations without a 
similar understanding before we start. 
I wish we would have focused on 
funding the essential elements of gov-
ernment long before now. Instead, too 
much time has been spent focusing on 
extremely partisan and costly bills 
being sent to the President’s desk, and 
there could be another bill on the way 
before the end of the year. 
It is unrealistic for Republicans to 
negotiate on appropriations bills while 
this massive reconciliation package is 
still under discussion. Our constituents 
are demanding that we take a com-
prehensive look at all of the spending 
this year. With our debt skyrocketing 
and inflation at the highest levels in 30 
years, we cannot afford to think about 
appropriations bills in isolation. How-
ever, I do hope that we can make 
progress getting our bills finalized once 
we move into the new year; otherwise, 
we will be having the same conversa-
tion in February about another con-
tinuing resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), who is the 
chairwoman of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to address this 
latest short-term budget fix before us. 
We have a bipartisan responsibility to 
pass a full-year appropriations pack-
age. Democrats have worked in good 
faith to find common ground that will 
allow us to meet our national obliga-
tions to the American people and de-
liver essential services that they ex-
pect. 
Unfortunately, Republicans have de-
cided that engaging in partisan politics 
and throwing up needless speed bumps 
in delays and roadblocks is more im-
portant than doing their job. 
The people harmed most by this ob-
struction are the hardworking families,

seniors, and veterans I represent. In 
fact, our Great Lakes region deserves 
so much better, and Americans deserve 
better. Let’s govern our Nation. No 
more stalls. 
Our bipartisan Energy and Water De-
velopment, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee worked diligently to craft a 
forward-thinking bill. It invests new 
resources to meet America’s needs and 
create good jobs in clean energy and 
water technologies allowing us to se-
cure our Nation’s energy independence, 
create good-paying jobs, and confront 
the climate crisis that is impacting 
every coast in every region and, frank-
ly, continent. 
A full-year bill will ensure our water 
resource agencies are able to meet the 
needs of the American people and solid-
ify our waterway and port infrastruc-
ture driving our economy forward, 
meeting the backlogs that are there, 
and creating good jobs from coast to 
coast. 
The people’s business must be con-
ducted, and for the sake of our Nation, 
Republicans should work in a construc-
tive manner, not destructive. 
We look forward to passing these 
bills and investing in the American 
people. For now, I urge my colleagues 
to support this bridge to the future and 
move our Nation forward again. 
b 1530 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I rise in reluctant opposition to 
the continuing resolution. 
But first, I want to recognize our 
good friend, Carrie Meek, from Florida. 
I share the gentlewoman’s sadness over 
her passing. She was a good friend. She 
was a great Member, and we will miss 
her, and I extend my condolences to 
her family. 
For months, my friends on the other 
side of the aisle spent their time 
crafting their big tax and spend social 
welfare bill. In the end, they passed a 
bill that will most likely fail in the 
Senate because it represents the most 
radical change to the American social 
contract in history, creating genera-
tions of dependency on the backs of the 
American middle class. While they 
went back and forth, going further left 
with each version, the clock on funding 
our government ran out. 
The most basic responsibility of this 
Congress is to fund the government, to 
ensure seniors and veterans receive 
their earned benefits on time. Yet, the 
majority pushed aside that basic duty 
in the name of radical social change. 
The CR before us represents their fail-
ure to govern. 
As the ranking Republican on the De-
fense 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee, 
our committee has heard firsthand 
about the threats that face our country 
and our allies. 
Right now, at this very moment, the 
Russians have amassed forces along the 
Ukrainian border, weeks after they 
purposely demonstrated their ability 
to destroy a satellite in high orbit. It is 
unbelievable. 
A record number of Chinese military 
airplanes have flown that Taiwan air-
space, and their naval forces continue 
to threaten freedom of navigation in 
the South China Sea. 
President Biden’s abject failure in 
Afghanistan, which freed an estimated 
7,000 hardened terrorists, has created 
more uncertainty for both us and our 
allies. And threats such as North 
Korea, Iran, and other nonstate actors 
remain as well. 
We cannot continue to cripple our 
national security apparatus with CRs 
year after year. It is not only waste-
ful—this CR is going to cost the De-
partment of Defense about $1.7 billion 
per month for nothing—but it allows 
our adversaries to continue gaining 
while we remain stagnant. 
Now more than ever, we must give 
them the funding and tools they need 
to counter threats to the United 
States. 
It is time that the majority focus on 
their most basic task: Do the work the 
American people expect of our govern-
ment. 
Our U.S. servicemembers, veterans, 
seniors, 
and 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
among us deserve better. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, once 
again, the Republicans refuse to come 
to the table to negotiate, thereby jeop-
ardizing benefits for our veterans and 
our national security. We can move if 
they come to the table. 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the 
chairman of the Appropriations Sub-
committee 
on 
Transportation, 
and 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this con-
tinuing resolution. But I want to make 
clear: This is a stopgap measure, neces-
sitated by Republican refusal to work 
with Democrats on a bicameral, bipar-
tisan basis to find a path forward for 
the balance of the fiscal year. 
Specifically, I can attest to the need 
for a full-year transportation T-HUD 
bill to update our aging transportation 
infrastructure, to remedy inequities in 
housing and transportation, prevent 
evictions, and make our infrastructure 
more resilient to natural disasters and 
climate change. 
We need to fortify safety as the pri-
mary function of the Federal Aviation 
Administration, 
providing 
full-year 
funding to strengthen certification ac-
tivities, modernize air traffic control, 
and hire highly qualified personnel. 
We need to fully renew all Section 8 
and other housing vouchers for nearly 5 
million low-income and working fami-
lies to ensure that they can remain 
stably housed. We also need to keep 
pace with the cost of upgrading our Na-
tion’s public housing, which houses 
more than 2 million low-income resi-
dents. 
We also spent months vetting over 
1,000 Community Project Funding re-
quests in a bipartisan manner for well- 
designed housing, transportation, and 
economic development projects that 
produce 
direct 
community 
benefits 
throughout the country. Without com-
pleting the annual appropriations proc-
ess, none of these investments will be 
possible. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this CR today but I also urge my Re-
publican colleagues to meet Congress’ 
most basic constitutional responsi-
bility of funding our government and 
directing investments for the future by 
coming to the table. Come to the table. 
Let’s find a constructive path forward. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
There is a lot of noise in this town 
right now about government shut-
downs, and the fact is, the issue isn’t 
about shutdowns. It is about whether 
or not Members of this body will con-
tinue to use money we don’t have to 
fund mandates, indoctrination, and the 
use of force against our citizens: 
$73.5 billion for the Department of 
Education that subsidizes the indoc-
trination of our children with critical 
race 
theory 
and 
woke 
gender 
ideologies; 
$10 billion for an FBI that was just 
used by the Attorney General of the 
United States to target parents; 
$50 billion for a Department of Home-
land Security that leaves our borders 
wide open, empowering cartels because 
Secretary Mayorkas fails to execute 
the laws of the United States; 
$6 billion for the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases run 
by Dr. Fauci. 
Need I say more? 
$592 million for OSHA, which has im-
posed 
an 
unconstitutional 
vaccine 
mandate on 84 million Americans. 
I offered an amendment to strip any 
funding from this bill that would fund 
Federal 
vaccine 
mandates, 
and 
it 
wasn’t even able to see the light of day. 
This is about a Congress that is sup-
posed to use the power of the purse, our 
Article I authority, rather than hiding 
behind the judges in Article III, to 
check the executive branch. We have a 
moral obligation to give voice and rep-
resentation to the people who elected 
us whose liberty and livelihoods are 
being attacked. 
My friend who battles MS is looking 
at being terminated from the univer-
sity she teaches at because of the un-
lawful Federal contractor mandate. 
The medical hero in Texas who is 9 
months pregnant is facing termination 
under the unlawful CMS mandate. 
Military personnel, including the 13- 
year Army veteran in my district who 
is concerned about myocarditis, are 
facing being discharged from service to 
our country. 
These are our neighbors, our rel-
atives, our friends—maybe not for 
some of you who go home to double- 
masked, vaccine passport cities. But

these are real Americans that this gov-
ernment wants to go after. 
I urge my colleagues to stop empow-
ering executive branch tyranny over 
Americans, and I urge my Republican 
colleagues to not just vote ‘‘no’’ and 
give a speech, but go stand with MIKE 
LEE. Go stand with others in the Sen-
ate trying to defend these Americans. 
We should not fund tyranny over 
American citizens. 
Ms. 
DELAURO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
antiscience fearmongering about vac-
cines is wrong. Fears about govern-
ment requirements for vaccines are 
flat-out silly. And the Republicans are 
prepared to shut down the government 
based on this. Incredible. 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. ROYBAL- 
ALLARD), the chair of the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Homeland Se-
curity. 
Ms. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD. 
Madam 
Speaker, each year, the first and most 
important responsibility Congress has 
is to determine how taxpayer dollars 
will be spent on behalf of our constitu-
ents. The continuing resolution before 
the House will prevent a government 
shutdown and give us sufficient time to 
complete the full-year funding bills if 
the minority will finally come to the 
negotiating table. 
Some friends on the other side of the 
aisle have suggested simply enacting a 
yearlong CR, which would effectively 
wash our hands of our constitutional 
duty. My subcommittee is responsible 
for drafting the funding bill for the De-
partment of Homeland Security. If, as 
my Republican colleagues have sug-
gested, we were to pass a full-year CR, 
DHS would lose critical increases in 
the House bill that are imperative to 
the security of the United States. This 
includes a historic 20 percent increase 
for the Cybersecurity and Infrastruc-
ture Security Agency; funding to in-
crease FEMA’s capacity to respond to 
the growing frequency of disasters 
linked to climate change; a quad-
rupling of funding for trade facilitation 
and security at our ports of entry; a 6 
percent increase for Homeland Secu-
rity Investigations; and an 8 percent 
increase for critical Coast Guard oper-
ations. 
Let’s quickly approve this short-term 
CR and then roll up our sleeves and 
work together to fulfill our constitu-
tional duty by negotiating full-year 
bills. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP), the chair-
man 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Agriculture, Rural De-
velopment, Food and Drug Administra-
tion, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
This year, House Democrats worked 
hard and passed government funding 
bills which support vital programs that 
create jobs, grow our economy, and en-
sure our national security. 
As chairman of the House Appropria-
tions Committee’s Subcommittee on 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food 
and Drug Administration, and Related 
Agencies, I want to stress that the pro-
grams in our bill touch the lives of 
every single American every day. 
It would ensure that USDA can con-
tinue to feed America and the world, to 
help expand economic opportunity, to 
create jobs in rural areas, and to fully 
meet the demand for farm ownership 
loans. 
It would increase funding to address 
the opioid crisis and rare cancers and 
resume unannounced, in-person inspec-
tions in the two largest foreign drug 
manufacturing countries in the world, 
China and India. 
Simply put, it would provide re-
sources to ensure that we have the 
most abundant, wholesome, and safest 
food and medicine in the world. 
It will help families that may strug-
gle to put food on the table through 
programs like SNAP and WIC. 
Sadly, the bill cannot move forward 
because, in the past few months, House 
and Senate Republicans have refused to 
negotiate with Democrats on govern-
ment funding. 
Today, we are passing this short- 
term bill just to keep the government 
open. In doing so, Democrats are mak-
ing sure our government continues 
serving the American people. We are 
also offering another chance for our 
Republican colleagues to come to the 
table with constructive proposals. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill and, more importantly, to come to-
gether with us to provide peace of mind 
and certainty to our fellow Americans 
by passing a full fiscal year ’22 funding 
bill package. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD letters in support of the bill 
from the Aerospace Industries Associa-
tion, the Coalition on Human Needs, 
the Coalition for Health Funding, and 
the National Defense Industrial Asso-
ciation.

Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER 
PELOSI, RANKING MEMBER MCCONNELL, AND 
RANKING
MEMBER
MCCARTHY: The United 
States aerospace and defense industries are 
an essential partner with the federal govern-
ment in an array of efforts vital to our econ-
omy and our national security. Each fall, 
that partnership is tested when those pro-
grams are slowed down or deferred by the use 
of multiple continuing resolutions (CR) to 
keep the government running. On behalf of 
our vital industries and our more than two 
million employees, the Aerospace Industries 
Association (AIA) strongly urges you to 
reach a near-term agreement on fiscal year 
2022 funding to avoid further CRs beyond De-
cember 3, 2021. 
Government watchdogs continue to docu-
ment the waste and unnecessary disruption 
that CRs cause to federal programs. Multiple 
agencies advised the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) in a 2021 report that 
longer CRs ‘‘contributed to distortions in 
agencies’ spending, adding to the rush to ob-
ligate funds late in the year before they ex-
pire.’’ The GAO determined that contracting 
officers working under a CR must continu-
ously align the period of performance under 
their contracts to the specific timeframe of 
a given CR, resulting in many unnecessary 
contract modifications during the year. Hir-
ing of new civilian staff is also delayed, mak-
ing it harder for agencies to meet their 
goals. The GAO notes that agencies apply 
creative workarounds in the first quarter of 
each fiscal year, because they assume that 
appropriations bills will not be in place by 
the beginning of the fiscal year. However, 
these effects become far more serious, and 
agency staff have fewer options, when CRs 
continue into the second quarter and beyond. 
The Department of Defense (DOD) is 
uniquely harmed under CRs because these 
bills typically prohibit DOD from starting 
new programs or activities or increasing any 
program’s production rate beyond that of the 
current fiscal year. Both ‘new starts’ and 
rate increases are critical for our national 
defense because our defense posture and 
threats are always evolving. As CRs extend 
to longer periods during the year, this is an 
increasing problem for which DOD seldom 
gets relief. DOD reported to the GAO that 
between FY10 and FY20, they had requested 
exceptions to CR language (called ‘‘anoma-
lies’’) 1,258 times and had only been granted 
three percent of those requests. Most of 
these requested relief from the prohibition 
on new starts and rate increases. We strong-
ly believe that, should Congress produce CRs 
extending into the second quarter of FY22, it 
should eliminate the prohibition on new 
starts and production rate increases. 
FY22 is the first year in a decade when dis-
cretionary spending levels have not been 
fixed in statute by the Budget Control Act. 
AIA has long argued that statutory caps are 
not needed because Congress and the admin-
istration are able to assess and address the 
needs of the nation more effectively, and 
with greater oversight, through the annual 
appropriations process. Last year, Congress 
enacted all 12 full-year appropriations bills 
by December 27. If Congress fails to once 
again enact full-year appropriations bills, or 
continues running the government into 2022 
under continuing resolutions, it will send the 
wrong signal to the government’s partners, 
like those in our industry. We count on sta-
ble, reliable and adequate funding to support 
the critical capabilities that we provide for 
all Americans. 
Like other industries, COVID–19 took a se-
rious toll on our workforce and the thou-
sands of small- and medium-sized businesses 
along the supply chain that are at the heart 
of the aerospace and defense industries. More 
than ever, businesses across all industries 
need predictability and consistency. 
We again ask that you ensure that all gov-
ernment programs receive full Fiscal Year 
2022 funding on or before December 3, 2021. 
Sincerely, 
ERIC FANNING, 
President and CEO, 
Aerospace Industries Association.

COALITION ON HUMAN NEEDS, 
Washington, DC, November 15, 2021. 
Hon. ROSA DELAURO, 
Chairwoman, House Committee on Appropria-
tions, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN DELAURO: On behalf of 
the Coalition on Human Needs, I am writing 
to strongly urge you to do everything in 
your power to enact omnibus FY 2022 appro-
priations legislation including all 12 sub-
committee bills. Our nation badly needs the 
increased funding provided in the House Ap-
propriations Committee bills. We face many 
increased needs, a great many exacerbated 
by the pandemic and its economic disloca-
tions. For more than a decade, funding levels 
for 
vital 
human 
needs 
programs 
have 
shrunk, especially taking inflation into ac-
count. If Congress fails to enact omnibus ap-
propriations legislation and instead defaults 
to a long-term continuing resolution (CR) 
with flat funding, we will seriously damage 
our capacity to respond to the multiple pub-
lic health and economic crises we face. As a 
member of the House Committee on Appro-
priations, you have a key role to play in 
working for enactment of an omnibus, not a 
long-term CR. 
Members of the Coalition on Human Needs, 
including human service provider organiza-
tions, faith groups, labor, civil rights, policy 
experts and other advocates concerned with 
meeting the needs of people with low in-
comes, enthusiastically welcomed the fund-
ing levels provided in the Biden FY 2022 
budget and the House and Senate Appropria-
tions Committees. We have tracked nearly 
200 human needs programs over the past dec-
ade. Between FYs 2010 and 2020, we found 
that two-thirds of these programs, covering 
health care, housing, nutrition, social serv-
ices, education, training, and more, had lost 
ground, taking inflation into account. In the 
past year, we have begun to rebuild. But the 
needs are also growing. 
We now face rising prices affecting neces-
sities including utilities, food, and rent. Flat 
funding from a prolonged CR would fail our 
people by not providing needed increases in 
programs such as the Low Income Home En-
ergy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The 
House increases LIHEAP by $125 million; the 
Senate bill increases funding by $175 million. 
Both these increases are too modest when 
taking into account that natural gas heating 
costs are projected to rise by 30 percent this 
winter and heating oil is expected to rise by 
43 percent. Nutrition programs will also need 
funding increases because of rising food 
prices. The House has provided $1.4 billion 
for Senior Nutrition programs, an increase of 
$436 million above the FY 2021 enacted level. 
Responding to the acute shortage of afford-
able housing, the House bill would expand 
rental assistance to 125,000 additional house-
holds. These increases are vitally needed. 
Flat funding in all these areas would be sim-
ply unacceptable. 
We have for some time faced a substance 
use crisis, and are projected to reach 100,000 
deaths from opioid overdoses by the end of 
this year, up from about 93,000 in 2020. The 
House funding level for the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) is $9.16 billion, $3 billion more 
than current year funding. Without those ad-
ditional funds, we will not be able to cope 
with the continuing increases in opioid ad-
diction. 
The pandemic has increased mental health 
problems. The proposed SAMHSA funding 
levels allow us to respond more adequately. 
In particular, House funding for various chil-
dren’s mental health programs increase by 
$118.5 million over current year levels. This 
is a vital turn-around after years of erosion. 
From FYs 2010 to 2020, Children’s Mental 
Health Services declined by 14 percent, in-
cluding inflation. We must not return to flat 
funding when the pandemic has adversely af-
fected the mental health of millions of chil-
dren and adults. 
Over the past decade, we allowed our pub-
lic health capacity to diminish, and as a con-
sequence we were not ready to cope with 
COVID–19. The House Labor-HHS-Education 
appropriations bill increases the Centers for 
Disease Control about $2.7 billion over the 
current year, allowing for the agency to re-
build so that it can more effectively respond 
to COVID–19 and future health threats. 
We know our economy is hampered by a 
mismatch between jobs available and people 
with the skills to fill those positions. FY 2022 
appropriations proposals include increases in 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
programs (WIOA), YouthBuild, Registered 
Apprenticeships, and Reintegration of Ex-Of-
fender programs, as well as expansion of 
community college training programs. These 
will lead to jobs with higher pay and broadly 
shared economic growth. These increases are 
needed to overcome a ten-year 17 percent re-
duction in WIOA programs and to move us 
forward. 
There are too many important programs to 
list here. But we do wish to underscore that 
children have experienced many hardships 
during the pandemic, including unprece-
dented losses in education. The historic in-
creases proposed in Title I K–12 education for 
students with low incomes and in special 
education funding are urgently needed to 
help children overcome the educational set-
backs they have experienced. Title I spend-
ing rises by at least $16.6 billion over FY 
2021, and there will be $341 more per student 
for more than 7.6 million students with dis-
abilities. The FY 2022 appropriations bills in-
clude many important funding increases to 
help families care for their children. In addi-
tion to the mental health, housing, and edu-
cation funding already mentioned here, there 
are badly needed increases in child care, 
Head Start, early learning programs, and 
child abuse prevention and treatment pro-
grams. There are also urgently needed in-
creases in funds to care for unaccompanied 
immigrant children. 
The nation’s recovery depends on strength-
ening a host of domestic programs that have 
been allowed to shrink for years, not just to 
get to where they had been before, but to re-
spond to needs far greater because of the 
pandemic and its global economic disloca-
tions. A long-term continuing resolution 
would be a severe failure to address these

bus appropriations legislation including all 
twelve bills as soon as possible.

DEAR CHAIR DELAURO, CHAIRMAN LEAHY, 
RANKING MEMBER GRANGER, AND VICE CHAIR-
MAN SHELBY: On behalf of the Campaign to 
invest in American’s Workforce, the Coali-
tion for Health Funding, the Coalition on 
Human Needs, and the Committee for Edu-
cation Funding and our members, we urge 
you to pass the fiscal year (FY) 2022 Labor- 
HHS-Education appropriations bill as soon 
as possible. The bill passed by the House this 
summer and the bill proposed by the Senate 
Appropriations Committee this fall provide 
vital increased funding for the programs and 
services that have a profound impact on 
health and well-being, child development, 
educational and skills attainment, employ-
ment, and productivity. Failing to enact the 
FY 2022 bill and relying on continuing reso-
lutions (CRs) would be a grave missed oppor-
tunity to improve the lives of all Americans. 
The use of extended CRs creates disruption 
and dysfunction, and injects fiscal uncer-
tainty into an already uncertain environ-
ment for the agencies that support the na-
tion’s public health, education, job training, 
social services, and much more. The reliance 
on CRs that extend far into the new fiscal 
year that has become commonplace in recent 
years limits Congress’s ability to exercise its 
oversight authority and make necessary ad-
justments to funding levels to meet new de-
mands. 
While short-term CRs are challenging 
enough, the possibility of a year-long CR 
could be catastrophic as our nation con-
tinues to struggle to return to normalcy 
amidst the COVID–19 pandemic. Below are 
some examples highlighting the challenges 
that a year-long continuing resolution poses 
to critical programs funded by the Labor- 
HHS-Education appropriations bill: 
Last year, the nation’s overdose rate in-
creased by a staggering 30 percent with 90,000 
deaths nationwide—a rate of increase not 
seen in three decades and it is now reported 
that drug overdose deaths reached 100,000 be-
tween April 2020 and April 2021, a grim 
record. In FY 2022, states are slated to re-
ceive billions of dollars to assist with pre-
vention, treatment, and recovery services— 
these dollars will be lost with a full year CR. 
CRs make it difficult for state and local 
health departments, as well as school dis-
tricts, to plan activities and hire staff as 
they rely on predictable funding from federal 
agencies to carry out their work. Funding 
delays will hold up essential programmatic 
work in communities across the country. 
CRs force grant-funding agencies like the 
National Institutes of Health to adopt con-
servative funding policies, holding back on 
investments in new areas of life-saving re-
search and damaging existing ongoing re-
search efforts. Unreliable and unpredictable 
funding streams hurt the nation’s scientific 
enterprise, and damage America’s competi-
tiveness globally. 
After a decade of almost frozen funding for 
education, the House and Senate Labor-HHS- 
Education bills provided needed investments 
for FY 2022, starting to address long-standing 
needs along the education continuum. Freez-
ing funding at last year’s levels would leave 
funding for the Department of Education 
below the level of a decade ago in inflation- 
adjusted dollars. 
The pandemic continues to have profound 
impacts on teaching and learning, and while 
the COVID-relief already enacted supports 
short-term costs associated with the pan-
demic, there will be new, ongoing needs that 
the FY 2022 appropriations bill begins to ad-
dress for students, educators, and institu-
tions. 
During the pandemic, the costs of child 
care at a center rose an estimated 47 percent, 
while family day care increased by 70 per-
cent; many child care centers were forced to 
close. Lack of child care is keeping many 
women from rejoining the labor force. The 
House bill increases child care by $1.5 billion 
and Head Start by $1.4 billion; flat-funding 
child care would make it impossible to re-
build capacity. 
More than 11.8 million people are unem-
ployed or underemployed and women, people 
of color and people without an education

past high school comprise a disproportionate 
amount of these workers. A CR would deny 
additional investments to an already histori-
cally underfunded workforce system at a 
time of great need. 
As the Administration works to implement 
the historic investments to our nation’s in-
frastructure included in the Bipartisan Infra-
structure Bill, the demand for skilled work-
ers in industries including construction, 
manufacturing, energy and related indus-
tries will continue to grow. At the same 
time, workers who lost their jobs in retail, 
hospitality and other sectors hardest hit by 
the pandemic are looking for opportunities 
to build new skills for available job opportu-
nities. A CR denies critical investments in 
training programs necessary to mitigate the 
current skills mismatch and allow workers 
to access the jobs for which businesses are 
hiring. 
The cost to heat a home with natural gas 
is projected to rise by 30 percent this winter; 
heating oil costs are expected to rise by 43 
percent. Flat-funding for the Low Income 
Home Energy Assistance Program would 
lead to dramatic reductions in the number of 
households served and the amount of help 
they get from LIHEAP. 
The undersigned organizations call on Con-
gress to pass a FY 2022 appropriations bill in 
a timely manner to avoid the damaging 
trend of long-term CRs and provide needed 
services for the American public. Thank you 
for your consideration. If you have questions

ate. 
Hon. ROSA DELAURO, 
Chairwoman, Appropriations Committee, House 
of Representatives. 
Hon. RICHARD SHELBY,

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
LEAHY, 
CHAIRWOMAN 
DELAURO AND RANKING MEMBERS SHELBY AND 
GRANGER: On behalf of the thousands of com-
panies represented by the National Defense 
Industrial Association (NDIA) and across the 
defense industrial base, we write to request 
the expedited completion of the defense ap-
propriation bill. While we applaud the bipar-
tisan effort to pass a continuing resolution 
(CR) and avoid a government shutdown, it is 
a poor stand-in for the full-year appropria-
tions desperately needed by our warfighters 
and those who provide them with the equip-
ment and services that enable their mission. 
We cannot stress enough the importance of 
the defense appropriations bill to our na-
tional security and to a healthy defense in-
dustrial base. The limbo caused under CRs 
wastes precious time and money our nation 
cannot recover. Delayed new starts and ini-
tiatives place a strain on companies and 
their workforce, particularly as they recali-
brate operations to a post-pandemic normal. 
Our nation’s competitors face no similar 
challenges putting us at a competitive dis-
advantage, particularly with emerging tech-
nologies, and place our supply chains at in-
creasing risk, something we cannot afford 
after the nearly two years of pandemic im-
pacts. 
Doing business with the Federal Govern-
ment is already hard. The tomes of regula-
tions, burdensome business requirements, 
sometimes Kafkaesque contracting and over-
sight procedures, and compressed margins 
have combined to drive businesses out of the 
defense sector with a net outflow of well over 
10,000 companies since 2011 and, as noted in 
our annual Vital Signs report, a halving of 
new entrants to the sector between fiscal 
2019 and fiscal 2020 alone. Add to that the un-
certainty of ‘‘if and when’’ a full-year de-
fense appropriations gets signed into law, 
more companies will reassess their participa-
tion in the defense industrial base. The ulti-
mate price of this is paid by our warfighters 
who will lose out on innovations and new ca-
pabilities not delivered. 
The inefficiencies caused by beginning 12 
of the last 13 fiscal years without full-year 
funding have cost the military services bil-
lions lost in inefficient expenditures and pro-
gram delays. Also, delayed contract starts 
challenge larger contractors while threaten 
the existence of smaller prime contractors 
and small businesses down the supply chain. 
The effect of that has a human face and a 
long-term impact. To execute a new-start 
contract, a company must recruit, hire, and 
train a workforce despite a tight labor mar-
ket and a shortage of workers with the re-
quired security clearance. Faced with a de-
layed start, that company must now choose 
between two bad options, either pay that 
workforce to stand idle or let those workers 
go—both of which could lead to contract or 
business failure and undelivered capabilities 
to our service members. 
With no full-year funding, we cannot afford 
to go too long without hampering readiness 
recovery efforts, delaying capabilities to our 
warfighters, and postponing investments in 
advanced technologies while allowing our de-
fense industrial base to erode. NOIA supports 
a bipartisan agreement on domestic and na-
tional security spending and encourages the 
adoption of a two-year budget to prevent an-
other year of budget instability and to pro-
vide the needed support to the Department 
of Defense for their critical missions. 
We appreciate your attention to this crit-
ical issue and look forward to working with 
your Committees moving forward. 
Very respectfully, 
HERBERT J. CARLISLE, 
General, USAF (Ret), 
President and CEO, 
National Defense In-
dustrial Association. 
ARNOLD L. PUNARO, 
MajGen, USMC (Ret), 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Board, National De-
fense Industrial As-
sociation. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE), the chair-
woman of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, let me first thank our chair, 
Congresswoman DELAURO, for yielding 
and for her tremendous leadership 
throughout this overall process be-
cause, I tell you, this continuing reso-
lution, it really should not be nec-
essary. 
We have had ample time under the 
previous CR to complete bicameral, bi-
partisan negotiations to complete our 
full-year funding responsibilities, but 
not all parties have agreed to even 
come to the table. 
But Democrats are determined to 
keep our government open, so I urge 
everyone to support this continuing 
resolution. 
There are immense needs, though, 
and challenges outside our borders. We 
must complete our work on a full-year 
appropriations bill that provides the 
much-needed investments in diplomacy 
and development to meet those chal-
lenges. 
For far too long, we have had an im-
balance between defense, diplomacy, 
and development. So I am very proud 
that the House passed the State-For-
eign Operations bill, increasing funding 
for global health and pandemic re-
sponse efforts, humanitarian assist-
ance, and our commitment to key al-
lies and partners. We must provide our 
international agencies the resources 
they need to defeat the global COVID– 
19 pandemic and ensure that we are 
taking the proper steps to protect our-
selves in the future. 
The House bill also has a tripling of 
environmental funding from the prior 
year, which are critical investments to 
address climate change and accelerate 
the progress in adaptation of clean en-
ergy. 
Our bill prioritizes the protection 
and advancement of women, including 
for family planning, which has not re-
ceived an increase in funding in over a 
decade. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from California. 
b 1545 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, these investments, along with 
other important investments in hous-
ing, jobs, and community investment, 
are on hold until we complete our work 
for fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills. 
So we must not shrink from our global 
responsibility but instead work to pass 
our budget, an omnibus bill, as soon as 
possible. Lives and livelihoods depend 
on this. 
Madam Speaker, again I thank Chair-
woman DELAURO for making sure we 
keep the government open. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6879 
December 2, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the 
chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Defense. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, we 
are here today to prevent the Repub-
licans from shutting down the Federal 
Government tomorrow. 
Republicans in the U.S. Senate are 
holding the FY 2022 appropriations 
process hostage by refusing to do any 
work, let alone negotiate with Demo-
crats. 
Rather than doing their job of fund-
ing the Federal Government, Senate 
Republicans want to kick the can down 
the road, wasting the first 41⁄2 months 
of the fiscal year. 
As chair of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on Defense, it is clear that 
Republicans are undermining our na-
tional security. They are increasing 
waste and inefficiency, they are weak-
ening our military readiness, and they 
are sending a signal to our troops and 
the millions of workers in the defense 
industry that they are not a priority. 
The American people should be sick 
and tired of hearing Republicans in 
Congress talk about how we need a 
stronger national defense while doing 
everything in their power to weaken 
our national defense. 
This is a time of instability in the 
world. Russia is knocking on the door-
step of Ukraine. China is at the door-
step of Taiwan. There are serious na-
tional security threats in the world. 
When our adversaries look at Con-
gress, they see Republicans playing po-
litical games rather than investing in 
research and modernization. What kind 
of message does that send to our adver-
saries? What kind of message does that 
send to the men and women of our 
military, who we ask to do the tough-
est jobs while putting their lives on the 
line? 
I am voting for this continuing reso-
lution to prevent a Republican shut-
down. But I must say, while this CR is 
necessary, I find it to be unacceptable 
as an outcome. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
these CRs, these fits and starts of 
prioritizing the Nation’s resources and 
allocating these resources so we can 
run the people’s government, are ineffi-
cient at best, they are dysfunctional, it 
is disgraceful, it is pervasive, and it is 
a structural issue that both Repub-
licans and Democrats have to solve ul-
timately. I am trying to be fair about 
this, because I have seen this happen 
when Republicans have been in charge, 
in all fairness. 
I think the difference this time in the 
life of our country is that my Demo-
crat colleagues have been distracted 
while trying to pass a massive tax-and- 
spend bill. It is the largest expansion of 
government and the largest tax hike. It 
is the biggest transfer of wealth. It is a 
lot of things, and they ain’t good. 
Meanwhile, 
we 
are 
just 
totally 
punting 
on 
managing 
our 
budget. 
Three years in a row, my colleagues 
have not put forth a budget. 
What I would like to see us do, to fix 
this for both sides, is to consider when 
we are talking about CRs and the debt 
ceiling and we are putting on display 
for the entire world how dysfunctional 
we are with respect to budget and ap-
propriations, is that we would actually 
put forward bipartisan reforms like en-
forceable spending caps. Those are gone 
after this year. How about paygos and 
CutGos that are actually enforceable 
so that we force Congress to do what 
everyone else in the country does, 
which is live within their means. 
There is a whole list here. Debt tar-
gets; no budget, no recess. How about 
we stay here and celebrate Christmas 
together and the holidays until we get 
a dadgum budget passed? 
There are lots of bipartisan measures 
that I implore my colleagues to talk to 
their leadership about while I am talk-
ing to mine, so we can do something 
about it and not just keep this dysfunc-
tion going infinitum. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, once 
again, it has been the Republicans’ re-
fusal to come to the table to negotiate 
that has stopped the process and forced 
us to do a short-term stopgap measure. 
We shouldn’t be doing it, but Repub-
licans need to come to the table. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
RYAN), the chairman of the Sub-
committee on the Legislative Branch. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, what 
you are seeing here before the United 
States Congress is two clear, different 
visions of America and where we want 
to go and what we want to do. 
We know that China is running cir-
cles around us. We know they are 
building islands in the South China 
Sea. We know Russia is on the border. 
We know the middle class has been 
eroded. And we know the Republican 
philosophy has been cut taxes for the 
top 1 percent and hope the crumbs fall 
down to places like Youngstown, Ohio. 
But what we are trying to do is three 
things. We want to build the United 
States, we want to rebuild the middle 
class, and we want to beat China. 
But we can’t do that if we don’t have 
our greatest weapon. And our greatest 
weapon during the Cold War and our 
greatest weapon over the last 50 years 
has been a strong middle class. That 
has been our greatest weapon, our 
greatest strength. We reinvested into 
the United States, we reinvested into 
our communities, we invested in the 
technology, and we dominated the in-
dustry: steel, glass, and aerospace. 
Now, we are hearing from the other 
side: Shut government down. Don’t do 
anything. We don’t want to be an hon-
est broker. 
Tyranny? What are you people talk-
ing about? We are talking about uni-
versal preschool, and they have it as a 
communist indoctrination of the Amer-
ican student. It is insane. 
We need to pass this appropriations 
bill. We need to pass the CHIPS Act, 
because we have got to close the tech-
nology gap. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, we see 
all of these cargo ships out in Cali-
fornia. They are not coming from Kan-
sas. They are coming from China. If we 
don’t reinvest and bring these supply 
chains back here, we are going to con-
tinue to lose. That is what is hap-
pening. 
China is out-manufacturing us in 
semiconductors, 
communications 
equipment, electric vehicles, and bat-
teries. We have to rebuild our country, 
or this whole thing isn’t going to work. 
We have got to make sure our kids 
are healthy and educated and skilled so 
they can thrive and outcompete China. 
That is what this bill is about. It is not 
about tyranny. It is not about com-
munist indoctrination. It is about re-
building the United States. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just want to make a point. The Re-
publicans on the Appropriations Com-
mittee want to increase our defense 
spending. We don’t want to cut defense 
spending. Both the Republicans and the 
Democrats on the authorizing com-
mittee don’t want to cut the defense 
spending. And both the Republicans 
and Democrats in the United States 
Senate don’t want to cut defense 
spending. 
We have a national defense strategy 
that was laid down by General Mattis, 
which I think we should follow, which 
asked for a net increase of a minimum 
of 3 to 5 percent net of inflation. That 
is just to maintain some credible deter-
rent against China and a resurgent 
Russia. Until we get to those numbers, 
we will continue to be operating on a 
continuing resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, if 
the Republicans wanted to do some-
thing about our defense and our secu-
rity in the military, they would move 
to work with us to pass the defense ap-
propriations bill and the omnibus. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), the chair of the 
Subcommittee on Military Construc-
tion and Veterans’ Affairs. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, the Republicans’ re-
fusal to negotiate bipartisan spending 
bills has us standing on another shut-
down cliff and, once more, relying on 
another Band-Aid funding bill. It is the 
same place we were 2 months ago when 
Congress voted to provide 2 more 
months for earnest negotiations. Since 
then, House and Senate Democrats put 
forth proposals, and Republicans put 
nothing on the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6880 
December 2, 2021 
As anyone who figures out their 
household bills every week knows, a 
table full of nothing doesn’t keep the 
lights on, doesn’t put groceries on the 
table. Nothing isn’t going to put food 
in the refrigerator, and it certainly 
doesn’t pay the phone bill or buy any-
one’s prescriptions. But that is what 
Republicans came up with in the last 2 
months: absolutely nothing. 
It looks a lot like the solutions Re-
publicans put forward to solve all of 
the problems American families face: 
nothing. They have no plan. 
So as responsible stewards, Demo-
crats on the Appropriations Committee 
crafted yet another extension to main-
tain funding levels through February 
and ensure that our most urgent needs 
can be met. 
But working families, small busi-
nesses, and veterans can’t live on tem-
porary patches. They need the cer-
tainty that comes with passing a full 
appropriations package to create jobs, 
prevent future pandemics, and keep 
schools safe. We need an omnibus budg-
et to safeguard our air, our food, and 
our water. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
Military Construction and Veterans’ 
Affairs, I know veterans need an omni-
bus to get their earned benefits, to 
slash the claims backlogs they face, 
and to fully meet their VA healthcare 
needs. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this con-
tinuing resolution because it will keep 
the government open and extend fund-
ing for critical education, health, hous-
ing, and public safety programs. These 
are programs and services that every 
community, red or blue, relies on every 
day. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Florida. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, Republicans’ refusal 
to put the American people first and 
faithfully negotiate leaves every par-
ent and mom-and-pop shop less secure. 
Let’s get serious about governing. 
I say to my Republican colleagues: It 
is time to show up for work and stop 
worshipping at the altar of Donald 
Trump for 5 minutes, long enough to do 
your job. 
Let’s 
stop 
this 
legislative 
brinksmanship and immediately begin 
to negotiate the FY 2022 bills so we can 
meet our country’s needs. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I think everybody knows, Madam 
Speaker, what the conditions are that 
have been pretty much publicized. Na-
tional defense spending must go up and 
the balance of the appropriations has 
to come down; the legacy riders must 
come back in, and the poison pills have 
to go away. It is pretty simple, as far 
as I am concerned. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
want to remind my colleague on the 
other side of the aisle that a con-
tinuing resolution is a cut to defense. 
If you come to the table, we will dis-
cuss it, then we can move forward on 
the defense of this Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. 
PINGREE), the chair of the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support the continuing resolu-
tion, which extends government fund-
ing at current levels until we pass a 
full appropriations package for the 
next fiscal year. 
It is my strong hope that this short- 
term extension will be the last one and 
that my colleagues across the aisle will 
acknowledge our solemn duty to exer-
cise the power of the purse. 
A continuing resolution that lasts a 
full year does not serve the American 
people. As the chair of the Sub-
committee on Interior, Environment, 
and Related Agencies, I can attest that 
the investments in the House interior 
bill would benefit all of our constitu-
ents, for those of us on both sides of 
the aisle. 
The bill makes long-overdue invest-
ments to protect human health, to 
fight the climate emergency, and to 
meet our trust obligations to Tribal 
nations. It provides critical resources 
to rebuild the Federal workforce so 
that these agencies can meet their mis-
sions and better serve the public. 
Failing to complete a full-year bill 
means no additional investments in the 
EPA to research and develop standards 
for harmful pollutants like PFAS, no 
further investments in domestic renew-
able energy, and insufficient resources 
for the healthcare of nearly 2.2 million 
American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
Regardless of whether we pass a full- 
year bill, we can be certain that mil-
lions of Americans will be exposed to 
pollution, that healthcare costs will 
rise, and that our window for miti-
gating climate change will shrink. 
To ignore these threats is not in the 
Nation’s best interest, nor any of ours. 
We were sent to Congress to improve 
the lives and livelihoods of our con-
stituents. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, but I en-
courage my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to finish the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
a letter from The Ad Hoc 
Group for Medical Research. 
THE AD HOC GROUP 
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH, 
November 15, 2021. 
Hon. ROSA DELAURO, 
Chair, Committee on Appropriations, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. KAY GRANGER, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. PATRICK LEAHY,

Hon. RICHARD SHELBY,

DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
DELAURO, CHAIRMAN 
LEAHY, RANKING MEMBER GRANGER, AND VICE 
CHAIRMAN SHELBY: Thank you for your past 
leadership in championing sustained, real 
growth in medical research funding. As Con-
gress begins to draft a final fiscal year (FY) 
2022 spending package, the 314 undersigned 
members of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical 
Research urge you to invest robustly in 
agencies and programs to improve the na-
tion’s health and well-being, including base 
funding for the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), as a key national priority and to fi-
nalize the appropriations process as expedi-
tiously as possible. The Ad Hoc Group for 
Medical Research is a coalition of patient 
and voluntary health groups, medical and 
scientific societies, academic and research 
organizations, and industry, dedicated to en-
hancing the federal investment in bio-
medical, behavioral, social, and population- 
based research supported by the NIH. 
We greatly appreciate that both the House- 
passed (H.R. 4502) and Senate draft Labor- 
HHS-Education spending bills include strong 
increases for the NIH base in FY 2022, which 
would provide greater hope and opportunity 
for every patient awaiting a cure, every re-
searcher working toward the next break-
through, and every aspiring scientist consid-
ering a career in the lab. To maximize the 
potential of medical research to make rapid 
progress toward these goals, we urge you to 
provide at least $46.4 billion for NIH’s base, 
as included in the House-passed bill. Con-
tinuing the momentum of the prior six years 
of bipartisan support for meaningful funding 
growth in the NIH’s existing institutes and 
centers is key to ensuring that the nation 
can continue to accelerate the development 
of life-changing cures, pioneering treatments 
and diagnostics, and innovative preventive 
strategies. 
Additionally, we appreciate that both bills 
ensure that the new investment for the pro-
posed Advanced Research Projects Agency 
for Health (ARPA–H) supplements, rather 
than supplants, the NIH’s base. While com-
plementary, NIH and ARPA–H have distinct 
and important missions. As such, investment 
in ARPA–H must not come at the expense of 
the NIH base. Instead, to fully realize the 
benefits of the envisioned new entity while 
simultaneously allowing NIH to keep pace 
with discovery, an FY 2022 appropriation of 
at least $46.4 billion for NIH’s base budget is 
needed. Prioritizing strong investments for 
foundational research discoveries funded by 
the NIH will be critical to the success of the 
visionary new research initiative, particu-
larly as it builds its operational capacity in 
its inaugural year and beyond. Likewise, 
avoiding further delays in finalizing funding 
determinations will enable both ARPA–Hand 
NIH’s planned and existing programs to be 
maximally efficient and strategic in their 
work in FY 2022. 
To that end, our organizations strongly 
support an approach to the final FY 2022 
spending package that avoids additional CRs 
past December. Aside from the budget impli-
cations, CRs create inefficiencies and add 
uncertainty to a system that is already

under stress with the continued reverbera-
tions of the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic. We 
strongly urge you to work swiftly in secur-
ing bipartisan, bicameral agreement on 
topline discretionary spending allocations 
and to ensure any final budget agreement re-
flects a strong commitment to the nation’s 
health. 
Once again, we commend you for con-
tinuing to recognize the incomparable value 
of the federal investment in the NIH, and we 
look forward to working with you to secure 
$46.4 billion for the agency’s base in FY 2022, 
in addition to funding you provide for 
ARPA–H.

Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, in the 
name of science, congressional Demo-
crats are continuing their unconstitu-
tional, unlawful march to force Ameri-
cans to get the jab. 
Think about it. Democrats are al-
ready on the path to ruin Christmas, 
destroying the supply chain. They are 
just going to keep going, right? De-
stroying industry after industry. 
For a party who praised America’s 
healthcare workers when there wasn’t 
a jab available, who were out there on 
the front lines, now if they don’t get it, 
it is okay to fire them, and not a word. 
Finally, mandates for defense con-
tractors and intelligence workers who 
have to make a choice between defend-
ing their country and putting their 
own life in peril, and no discussion 
about natural immunity, none whatso-
ever. You could have had COVID al-
ready. Not good enough. You have got 
to get the jab or lose your job. 
Vote against this. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
just want to remind the gentleman 
that antiscience fearmongering about 
vaccines is wrong. Science is on our 
side, and history is on our side. Vac-
cines work. 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), the chair-
man 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Financial Services and 
General Government. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in disappointed support of a 
second continuing resolution, but let’s 
remember, every continuing resolution 
reflects a failure to govern. 
House Democrats did our job and 
passed government funding bills, all of 
them, to create good-paying jobs to 
support the hardworking middle class 
and protect our national security. 
In September, we voted on a bipar-
tisan basis to extend government fund-
ing through December 3 to allow nego-
tiations to finalize legislation. Since 
then, my colleagues across the aisle 
have refused to seriously negotiate 
with us on funding. 
That leads us to where we are now, 
considering another new short-term CR 
right before the holiday break, when 
we should have already completed our 
work. 
The definition of insanity is doing 
the same thing over and over again and 
expecting 
a 
different 
result. 
Sure 
enough, here we are again, having to 
pass another short-term CR because we 
can’t pass funding bills in a regular 
manner. 
There is more than enough time in a 
year to come to an agreement and pass 
funding bills. America’s friends and en-
emies around the world are watching 
us to see if our country can continue to 
function in a changing world. We must 
show them we can, but this effort re-
quires compromise, as it always has. 
I ask them to join us for a bipartisan, 
bicameral negotiation to resolve our 
differences and keep government work-
ing for the people. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), 
the chairman of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of the continuing reso-
lution. At the same time, I join my col-
leagues in calling on the other side of 
the aisle to join in helping enact a 
year-long appropriations act, the way 
we are supposed to do, rather than re-
lying on this kind of stop-and-go gov-
ernment funding or a full-year con-
tinuing resolution, as has also been 
threatened. 
Look, a full-year continuing resolu-
tion would be disastrous to our country 
in so many ways. It would greatly 
limit or reduce essential investments 
in our Nation’s future. 
As 
for 
the 
Commerce, 
Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies appro-
priations bill, as reported out of com-
mittee earlier this year, it provides 
funding increases aimed at creating 
jobs in distressed communities, enforc-
ing our trade laws, fighting crime and 
supporting 
community 
involvement 
with law enforcement, ensuring civil 
rights, advancing American scientific 
research, fighting the opioid epidemic, 
confronting the climate crisis, among 
so many other critical public invest-
ments. These funding increases are 
only possible with an appropriations 
agreement. 
I urge support, both for the short- 
term CR, and to quickly finalize a full- 
year appropriations agreement. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the Chairwoman and all of the 
very important people on the Appro-
priations Committee for their work on 
this bill. 
I ask the question, what side do you 
want to be on? Do you want to be on 
the side that provides our hardworking 
military pay raises for the troops, to be 
able to get money away from a mis-
directed war? 
Do you want to be on the side that 
provides for working families? 
Do you want to be on the side that 
stops those who can’t pay for daycare 
to have that? 
Do you want to be on the side of 
those who say, ‘‘I am a Federal em-
ployee, and I have been shut out of my 
job’’? 
What side do you want to be on? I 
want to be on the side of negotiating 
an omnibus that works for the Amer-
ican people. I want my Republican 
friends to know that we have tried to 
negotiate, but we are adults and we are 
not going to let this government shut 
down. 
What we are going to do is recognize 
these are dangerous times. We know 
that there is now an omicron variant. 
We 
are 
not 
going 
to 
play 
the 
antivaxxer game, we are not going to 
say that it is about vaccine mandates 
because we know that most of the Fed-
eral Government has been vaccinated; 
but what we are going to do is extend 
this resolution to keep the government 
open because the side that Democrats 
are on is the side of the American peo-
ple and our government workers who 
go out and work every day and the 
families who go out and work every 
day. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCANLON). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gen-
tlewoman for yielding. A shutdown 
would induce furloughs that could hit 
62 percent of the U.S. Centers for Dis-
ease Control, right in the middle of 
COVID–19. 
In addition, families would be des-
perate as well. 
I want you to understand that vet-
erans would suffer. During the Thanks-
giving holiday, I went to the veterans 
hospital. I can tell you, it is not empty. 
Veterans are there every day, and when 
they are there, they are getting serv-
ices. Do you want to be part of a gov-
ernment shutdown where veterans hos-
pitals are closed and veterans are 
standing outside with their hand ask-
ing what is happening? 
I want to be on the side of those who 
understand the value of working for 
the American families and doing what 
Democrats have done, passing bills, 
passing laws that serve the American 
people. 
Vote for the CR and vote for the om-
nibus so that we can get the job done. 
I thank the gentlewoman for her cour-
tesies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6883 
December 2, 2021 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in support 
of H.R. 6119, the ‘‘Further Extending Govern-
ment Funding Act,’’ which provides funding to 
continue the operations of the federal govern-
ment through February 18, 2022, and avoids 
a wasteful and irresponsible shutdown, and 
also the underlying bill. 
House Democrats passed government fund-
ing bills to create good paying jobs, support 
the hard-working middle class, and protect our 
national security; Senate Democrats have also 
released all their appropriations bills. 
Without an omnibus, there will be a shortfall 
that will cause veterans not to receive their 
benefits in full. 
For our national security, we need an omni-
bus to support defense readiness and mod-
ernization, sustain good-paying American jobs, 
secure our cyber infrastructure, and strength-
en American leadership abroad. 
Without an omnibus, a pay raise for troops 
will not be funded while funds will be mis-
directed to a war we are no longer fighting. 
With a new deadline of February 18, we 
need Republicans to offer constructive pro-
posals to address the critical issues facing the 
country by funding the federal government’s 
important work for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I need not remind my col-
leagues that we are at a critical point in the 
fight against this pandemic—less than 24 
hours ago, it was reported that the first case 
of the Omicron variant was confirmed in the 
United States. 
Our response in the following days and 
weeks will be crucial. 
Yet some of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle in the House and the Senate 
have indicated that they intend to block the 
passage of this stopgap spending bill in order 
to trigger a shutdown of the Federal govern-
ment unless a bill is passed that undoes 
President Biden’s initiatives to vaccinate and 
test employees at large companies. 
Simply put, this is irresponsible and dan-
gerous at a time when we have a new threat 
on our soil in the form of the Omicron variant. 
A government shutdown would induce fur-
loughs that could hit 62 percent of employees 
at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. 
It would be nothing other than reckless to 
hamstring the agency at the center of Amer-
ica’s fight against the COVID–19 pandemic at 
this time—we need all hands on deck. 
In September, Congress voted on a bipar-
tisan basis to extend government funding 
through December 3 to allow time for bi-
cameral, bipartisan negotiations to complete 
omnibus government funding legislation. 
Since then, House and Senate Republicans 
have refused to negotiate with Democrats on 
government funding. 
In fact, while House and Senate Democrats 
have put forward their proposals, Republicans 
have not presented an offer of their own. 
Therefore, the Appropriations Committee in-
troduced H.R. 6119, the Further Extending 
Government Funding Act, which continues 
government funding at current levels through 
February 18. 
It makes minimal changes to address the 
most urgent of needs during the period of the 
Continuing Resolution. 
Although this bill is necessary, working fami-
lies, small businesses, veterans, and our mili-
tary need the certainty that comes with pass-
ing an omnibus as opposed to short-term 
funding patches. 
Republicans must join us for bipartisan, bi-
cameral negotiations to resolve our differences 
and keep government working for the people. 
For our communities, we need an omnibus 
to create jobs by supporting small businesses, 
bolster our public health infrastructure to pre-
vent future pandemics and medical research 
to save lives, strengthen public schools with a 
focus on those serving students with the high-
est need, protect our air and water through 
environmental protection and enforcement ef-
forts, combat the opioid epidemic on the 
ground in our communities, and support core 
services such as food safety and consumer 
product inspections. 
Without an omnibus, investments in all 
these areas will be denied. 
For our veterans, we need an omnibus to 
provide sufficient funding for veterans’ bene-
fits, reduce backlogs for veterans and their 
families seeking assistance, and meet the 
needs of the VA’s health care system. 
Throughout the 117th Congress, House 
Democrats have worked to deliver results for 
the American people, passing legislation to 
address each pillar of the ‘‘For The People’’ 
agenda: lower health care costs, higher wages 
by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corrup-
tion and strengthening our Democracy. 
And under the leadership of Speaker 
PELOSI, the House has passed hundreds of 
bills, including legislation to crush the COVID– 
19 pandemic, build our economy back better, 
lower health care and prescription drug prices, 
raise wages, advance economic and retire-
ment security, end gun violence, act on the cli-
mate crisis, protect Dreamers, and strengthen 
voting rights. 
For example, in this Congress the House 
has passed and sent to the President the fol-
lowing legislation that has been signed into 
law: 
H.R. 1799, Paycheck Protection Program 
Extension Act: 
This legislation extended the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program application deadline for two 
months through May 31, 2021 to help strug-
gling businesses keep workers employed dur-
ing COVID–19. 
H.R. 1276, SAVE LIVES Act: 
This law ensured that more veterans, their 
families, and caregivers got access to COVID– 
19 vaccines in a timely manner. 
S. 937, COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act: 
This law addresses the dramatic increase in 
hate crimes targeting the AAPI community 
since the start of the pandemic. This law des-
ignates a point person at the Department of 
Justice to review hate crimes related to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, bolsters state and local 
governments to improve their reporting of hate 
crimes and ensures that hate crime informa-
tion is more accessible to Asian-American 
communities. 
S. 475, Juneteenth National Independence 
Day Act: 
This law established the first federal holiday 
in 38 years to formally recognize Juneteenth 
National Independence Day and commemo-
rate the end of slavery in the United States. 
House Democrats have also worked to ad-
vance critical pieces of legislation, which await 
action in the Senate: 
H.R. 1, For The People Act: 
This comprehensive legislation would pro-
mote government transparency, strengthen ac-
cess to the ballot box and make it easier for 
Americans to exercise their right to vote, se-
cure election infrastructure, and curb the influ-
ence of dark money in politics. 
H.R. 5, Equality Act: 
The Equality Act would codify consistent 
anti-discrimination legal protections for LGBTQ 
Americans by amending several existing civil 
rights laws to include explicit non-discrimina-
tion protections in key areas of life. 
H.R. 6, Dream and Promise Act: 
The Dream and Promise Act would protect 
Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), 
and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) sta-
tus holders from deportation and provide an 
opportunity to obtain permanent legal status 
that would enable these groups to work legally 
within the United States and continue to con-
tribute to their local communities and econ-
omy. 
H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act: 
This bill would strengthen labor protections 
around equal pay by prohibiting the use of sal-
ary history to set compensation, provide more 
transparent options for joining class-action 
lawsuits challenging systemic discrimination, 
and require employers to show that gender 
pay gaps are job-related and consistent with 
business need. 
H.R. 8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act 
and H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background 
Checks Act: 
These bills would modernize federal laws 
around gun sales. The former would close cur-
rent loopholes that allow buyers to purchase 
guns without a background check in certain 
venues, while the latter would prevent gun 
sales from going through before background 
checks are completed. 
H.R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice in Po-
licing Act: 
This bill, which House Democrats also 
passed in the 116th Congress 30 days after 
the murder of George Floyd, will address ra-
cial bias in policing, ensure accountability for 
police brutality and misconduct, and work to 
change the culture of law enforcement to pro-
mote better relationships with the communities 
they serve. 
H.R. 842, Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act: 
This bill aims to strengthen labor protections 
for union workers through overriding Repub-
lican-led ‘‘right to work’’ laws, promoting free 
and fair union elections, and holding compa-
nies that attempt to restrict union activity ac-
countable. 
H.J. Res. 17, Removing the Deadline for 
Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment: 
This resolution would remove the deadline 
for ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment in 
order to enshrine women’s equality in the 
Constitution. 
H.R. 1620, Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act: 
This long-overdue legislation to reauthorize 
the Violence Against Women Act passed the 
House with bipartisan support. It would reau-
thorize funding to vital grant programs that 
help prevent sexual assault, domestic vio-
lence, and improve access to resources for 
victims and survivors. 
H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security Supple-
mental to Respond to 1/6 Appropriations Act: 
This bill provides $1.9 billion in funding to 
secure the U.S. Capitol Complex and ensure 
the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol 
Police have the resources they need to do

their jobs. The legislation responds to the di-
rect costs incurred by the National Guard and 
DC police on January 6, provides funding to 
improve the security of windows and doors in 
the Capitol complex, and secures funds to im-
prove Capitol Police training and equipment. 
H.R. 3005, Legislation to #RemoveHate 
from the Capitol Building: 
This bill would remove statues of those who 
perpetuated and supported slavery and seg-
regation in this country, along with statues or 
busts of those who served voluntarily in the 
Confederate States of America, from public 
display in the U.S. Capitol. 
H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act: 
This bipartisan bill would stabilize the agri-
culture industry’s labor supply by reforming the 
H–2A guest worker program and creating a 
pathway to citizenship for agricultural workers, 
many of whom worked through the pandemic. 
H.R. 51, the Washington, DC Admission 
Act: 
This bill would admit Washington, DC as the 
51st state in the Union and end the injustice 
in denying nearly 700,000 citizens the right to 
be represented fully in Congress. It would also 
end the unjust practice of treating District of 
Columbia residents differently when allocating 
government resources or relief. 
H.R. 3985, ALLIES Act: 
This bill would increase the visa cap and ex-
pedite the visa process for Afghan allies who 
worked alongside American military personnel, 
diplomats, development professionals, and 
partner forces, to help ensure they make it 
safely out of harm’s way. 
H.R. 803, Protecting America’s Wildness 
and Public Lands Act: 
This comprehensive bill would conserve and 
protect natural landscapes across America, 
designating over 1.5 million acres of public 
land as protected wilderness and withdrawing 
significant amount of public land from drilling 
and mining activities to promote a healthier 
environment. 
H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act: 
This bipartisan bill would improve the safety 
of Americans’ drinking water by requiring the 
EPA to set a drinking water standard, prevent 
the future release of PFAS chemicals into our 
bodies of water, and start the process of 
cleaning up affected communities. 
H.R. 256, Repeal of the 2002 AUMF 
Against Iraq: 
This bill, which passed with bipartisan sup-
port, would repeal the 2002 Authorization of 
Military Force Against Iraq. 
H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act: 
The bipartisan Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act restores protections 
for older workers that were weakened in a 
2009 Supreme Court ruling that made it hard-
er for older workers to prove age based dis-
crimination in the workplace. 
H.R. 2662, the Inspectors-General Inde-
pendence and Empowerment Act: 
This bill seeks to promote government 
transparency and accountability by ensuring 
the independence of federal inspectors-gen-
eral, allowing government watchdogs to act 
freely without fear of political pressure or 
threats. It would also protect whistleblowers 
from threats of retaliation by making it a viola-
tion of House rules for Members to reveal their 
identities. 
In addition, three Congressional Review Act 
resolutions have been signed into law, over-
turning dangerous rules put in place by the 
Trump Administration: 
S.J. Res 13, a CRA overturning an EEOC 
rule to address discrimination in the work-
place; 
S.J. Res. 14, a CRA addressing dangerous 
methane emissions; and 
S.J. Res. 15, a CRA to protect against pred-
atory lenders. 
These along with many, many others are 
among the bills awaiting Senate action. 
Madam Speaker, let me briefly list several 
of the programs vital to Americans that are 
protected or extended by H.R. 6119. The bill: 
Provides waiver language for certain intel-
ligence programs as well as agencies that op-
erate under the State Department Basic Au-
thorities Act and Foreign Relations Authoriza-
tion Act; 
Allows the Food and Nutrition Service to 
spend at a higher rate during the period cov-
ered by the legislation to provide supplemental 
USDA foods to low-income seniors (age 60 
and over) and to some low-income women, in-
fants and children up to age six. 
Allows a higher spending rate for the White 
House to support continuing COVID–19 oper-
ations. 
Allows the Small Business Administration 
flexibility to spend at the rate necessary to ac-
commodate potential demand increases for 
commitments for business loans through the 
7(a) and 504 business loans, for the Sec-
ondary Market Guarantee Program, and for 
the Small Business Investment Company 
(SBIC) program. 
Allows District of Columbia voucher schools 
an additional year to be accredited and there-
fore remain in the program. The accrediting 
process requires in-school visits, which are not 
happening during the coronavirus. 
Allows the District of Columbia to spend FY 
2021 funds received from local tax revenues 
and other non-Federal sources in the amount 
and for the programs and activities provided in 
DC’s FY 2021 Budget Act. 
Extends the term of certain bankruptcy 
judgeships. 
Allows the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to access the entire DRF appropria-
tion for fiscal year 2021 under the continuing 
resolution as necessary to respond to de-
clared disasters. 
Continues the authorization for the NFIP. 
Extends funding for the Temporary Assist-
ance for Needy Families program and the 
Child Care Entitlement to States program dur-
ing the period of the continuing resolution. The 
extension will allow HHS to make first-quarter 
payments to States. 
Extends the availability of funding for 
multiyear research grants supported by the 
National Institutes of Health that were inter-
rupted in fiscal year 2020 by COVID–19 and 
would have expired at the end of the fiscal 
year. 
Madam Speaker, our colleagues across the 
aisle have in both chambers have been ob-
structive, dilatory, petulantly uncooperative 
throughout the first session of the 117th Con-
gress. 
Nowhere was this more apparent than the 
refusal of the majority of J Republican mem-
bers in the House voted 175–35 against H.R. 
3233, legislation modeled after the 9/11 Com-
mission establishing a National Commission to 
Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United 
States Capitol Complex Act. 
Madam Speaker, American families do not 
get to choose which bills to pay and which 
ones to ignore; neither can the United States 
Congress without putting the nation into de-
fault for the first time in its history. 
Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the 
nation’s first and greatest Treasury Secretary, 
understood that the path to American pros-
perity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness 
which provided the affordable access to cap-
ital needed to fund internal improvements and 
economic growth. 
The nation’s creditworthiness was one of its 
most important national assets and according 
to Hamilton: ‘‘the proper funding of the present 
debt, will render it a national blessing.’’ 
But to maintain this blessing, or to ‘‘render 
public credit immortal,’’ Hamilton understood 
that it was necessary that: ‘‘the creation of 
debt should always be accompanied with the 
means of extinguishment.’’ 
In other words, to retain and enjoy the pros-
perity that flows from good credit, it is nec-
essary for a nation to pay its bills. 
To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and 
credit of the United States, protect American 
jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure 
the continued growth of the economy, I strong-
ly support the provision in the bill before ex-
tending the public debt limit to December 16, 
2021. 
Madam Speaker, I would also like to dis-
cuss an important topic that is closely related 
to this bill and that this House must address 
very soon—raising the debt ceiling. 
Preserving the full faith and credit of the 
United States by raising to the debt limit to en-
sure that America pays the bills for past ex-
penditures when they come due is not a par-
tisan exercise but an act of patriotism, a rec-
ognition and embrace of the solemn obligation 
to preserve the unrivaled advantages that flow 
from the ability provided in the Article I, Sec-
tion 8, clause 2 of the Constitution to ‘‘borrow 
money on the credit of the United States.’’ 
Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the 
nation’s first and greatest Treasury Secretary, 
understood that the path to American pros-
perity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness 
which provided the affordable access to cap-
ital needed to fund internal improvements and 
economic growth. 
It is because of the existence and wise use 
of the Borrowing Power that the nation was 
able to expand its reaches, resources, and 
riches by financing the Louisiana Purchase, 
the purchase of Alaska from Russia, to fund 
the investments to end the Great Depression, 
to finance the mobilization of resources need-
ed in World War II to defeat fascism and save 
freedom in the nation and the world, to revive 
the economy after the catastrophic Great Re-
cession of 2008, and most recently, to protect 
the public health and safety and restore the 
economy during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This is why the ability to borrow money on 
the credit of the United States to finance its 
growth and protect its people and interests is 
essential to the national security and led Ham-
ilton to proclaim that ‘‘the proper funding of the 
present debt, will render it a national bless-
ing.’’ 
But to maintain this blessing, or to ‘‘render 
public credit immortal,’’ Hamilton understood 
that it was necessary that: ‘‘the creation of 
debt should always be accompanied with the 
means of extinguishment.’’ 
In other words, to retain and enjoy the pros-
perity that flows from good credit, it is nec-
essary for a nation to pay its bills.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6885 
December 2, 2021 
The United States has never defaulted on 
the payment of any debt incurred, and be-
cause of the size and strength of its economic 
and unmatched creditworthiness, is able to 
borrow on the lowest and most favorable 
terms of any nation or entity in the history of 
the world. 
So secure and reliable is a bond issues by 
the Department of Treasury that the Unites 
States is the preferred haven for investments 
of foreign governments, corporations, and sov-
ereign wealth funds. 
The interest rate charged the federal gov-
ernment of the United States is the base for 
which every rate, from the prime rate charged 
the richest corporation to rates charged small 
business on purchases to the mortgages rates 
and students loans taken out by consumers. 
If you raise the cost of borrowing for the 
government of the United States, you set off 
a chain reaction of increased interest rates for 
every other borrower in the United States and 
around the world. 
This is why leading public finance experts 
and agencies, like Moody’s Chief Economist 
Mark Zandi, have said it would be ‘‘cata-
clysmic’’ for the United States to default on its 
loan obligations. 
Republicans know the debt ceiling needs to 
be raised; in 2019 during the Trump Adminis-
tration, the Republican Senate Majority Leader 
marshalled Senate Republicans to vote to 
raise the debt ceiling, saying: ‘‘We raised the 
debt ceiling because America can’t default[,] 
that would be a disaster.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this debate over extending 
the debt limit is not about restraining future 
spending, it is about paying the bills piled up 
already under both Republican and Demo-
cratic administrations. 
The question of raising the national debt 
limit does not depend on how one feels about 
the Build Back Better agenda, as wildly pop-
ular as it is among all Americans, Democrats, 
Independents, and Republicans included. 
It is instead about preserving the singular 
asset of the United States, its enviable and 
unrivaled creditworthiness, to finance future in-
vestments beneficial to the national interest, 
like the provision of free college for two years, 
or $2 billion investment to reduce violence in 
communities approved by the Committee on 
the Judiciary, or investments to preserve and 
strengthen Medicaid expansion programs, or 
extend broadband to underserved rural and 
urban areas, an action that will be as life- 
changing as the rural electrification program 
was in the 1930s. 
Madam Speaker, if our friends across the 
aisle really want to shrink the deficit, reduce 
the national debt, practice fiscal responsibility, 
and bring about sustained economic growth 
and prosperity, there is a much better, easier, 
and more certain way to achieve these goals 
than by tampering with the U.S. Constitution. 
The easier and better way is for the Amer-
ican people to keep a Democrat in the White 
House and place Democratic majorities in the 
House and Senate. 
In the 1990s under the leadership of Presi-
dent Clinton the budget was balanced for four 
consecutive years, the national debt was paid 
down, the national debt, 23 million new jobs 
were created, and projected surpluses ex-
ceeded $5 trillion. 
Under President Obama the financial crisis 
and economic meltdown inherited from his Re-
publican predecessor was ended, the annual 
deficit was reduced by 67 percent, the auto in-
dustry was saved from collapse, and 15 mil-
lion jobs were created. 
In contrast, under every Republican admin-
istration since President Reagan the size of 
the deficit bequeathed to his successor was 
substantially larger than the deficit he inher-
ited, a major economic recession occurred, 
and economic growth was lower than it was at 
the beginning of his administration. 
To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and 
credit of the United States, protect American 
jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure 
the continued growth of the economy, raised. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I am 
kind of a little confused. Last I looked, 
the Democratic Party controls the 
House, they control the Senate, and 
they control the White House. If they 
want to pass an omnibus bill, pass it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
first want to say thank you to the Ap-
propriations chair and to the members 
of the Appropriations Committee for 
their extraordinary work. 
Let’s be clear about one thing. A con-
tinuing resolution is not a way to pro-
ceed, but it is the only way we can pro-
ceed in the face of Republican obstruc-
tion, and when you vote ‘‘no’’ on the 
continuing resolution, you are voting 
to defund the government and shut it 
down. 
That means veterans can’t access 
healthcare at the VA. 
It means Native American Tribes 
can’t have access to healthcare and 
schools. 
It means our troops won’t get the pay 
they deserve. 
You are voting to shut the govern-
ment down, and at the same time you 
are unwilling to be part of a process to 
pass appropriations bills for an entire 
year. You are here to govern. You have 
a responsibility to make sure this ap-
propriation process works. And I am 
grateful for the service of the members 
of the Appropriations Committee that 
have worked on this in a painstaking 
way. 
We have Republicans in the Senate 
who are obstructing this process, but I 
am glad that I am part of the process 
that makes sure government remains 
open, that we take care of our respon-
sibilities, that we ensure that the eco-
nomic recovery that is underway is not 
hampered. I thank the chair of the Ap-
propriations Committee for the hard 
work in bringing us to this moment. 
I urge everyone to support the con-
tinuing resolution. Be responsible. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just say to you that we have 
heard from a number of advocacy 
groups urging the Congress to move on 
taking up a full-year omnibus. Let me 
just tell you the groups that have writ-
ten to us. 
We are looking at the National De-
fense Industrial Association: On behalf 
of thousands of companies represented 
by the National Defense Industrial As-
sociation, we write to request the expe-
dited completion of the defense appro-
priation bill. 
We talk about the Association of 
American Universities: Urge you to 
reach a bipartisan agreement to com-
plete the FY22 appropriations process 
before the end of the year. 
The Aerospace Industries Associa-
tion: Our essential partners are urging 
us to avoid a further CR beyond De-
cember 3, wanting us to come to the 
table in order to be able to have a full- 
year appropriations bill. 
The Coalition for Health Funding, 
the same message to all of us: Relying 
on continuing resolutions would be a 
grave, missed opportunity to improve 
the lives of all Americans. A full-year 
appropriations bill. 
The Ad Hoc Group for Medical Re-
search telling us the very, very same 
thing: To maximize the potential of 
medical research, we need to move for-
ward with a full-year bill. 
The veterans organizations saying 
the same thing: Do not shortchange 
veterans and their benefits by holding 
back on a full-year appropriations bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD statements in support of the 
bill from a broad coalition of groups 
urging negotiations now, as well as let-
ters from veterans’ organizations and 
America’s 
leading 
research 
univer-
sities. 
BROAD COALITION OF GROUPS URGING 
NEGOTIATIONS NOW 
A broad coalition of groups have joined 
Chair DeLauro and Democratic Appropri-
ators urging negotiations and agreement on 
fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills. These 
organizations include: 
AD HOC GROUP FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH 
Our organizations strongly support an ap-
proach to the final FY 2022 spending package 
that avoids additional CRs past December. 
Aside from the budget implications, CRs cre-
ate inefficiencies and add uncertainty to a 
system that is already under stress with the 
continued reverberations of the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic. We strongly urge you to 
work swiftly in securing bipartisan, bi-
cameral agreement on topline discretionary 
spending allocations and to ensure any final 
budget agreement reflects a strong commit-
ment to the nation’s health. 
AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION 
The United States aerospace and defense 
industries are an essential partner with the 
federal government in an array of efforts 
vital to our economy and our national secu-
rity. Each fall, that partnership is tested 
when those programs are slowed down or de-
ferred by the use of multiple continuing res-
olutions (CR) to keep the government run-
ning . . . If Congress fails to once again 
enact full-year appropriations bills, or con-
tinues running the government into 2022 
under continuing resolutions, it will send the 
wrong signal to the government’s partners, 
like those in our industry. We count on sta-
ble, reliable and adequate funding to support

the critical capabilities that we provide for 
all Americans. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH 
As the nation continues to combat the 
COVID–19 pandemic, cancer has not stopped, 
and remains the second leading cause of 
death in the United States. To better pre-
vent, detect, and treat cancers, Congress 
must act swiftly to increase investments in 
cancer research and prevention. A full-year 
continuing resolution or funding lapse would 
threaten our nation’s research enterprise 
and stall medical breakthroughs that could 
benefit the lives of millions of patients with 
cancer and survivors. The AACR urges con-
gressional negotiators to come to the table 
and agree to Fiscal Year 2022 allocations 
that would support robust and sustained 
funding for cancer research and prevention. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES 
Higher education, research, and innovation 
play integral roles in our nation’s competi-
tiveness, security, health, and ability to 
combat and overcome the pandemic. Our na-
tion cannot afford continued inaction on 
FY22 appropriations. In the absence of final 
appropriations, federal agencies postpone re-
search award decisions and prepare for po-
tential lapses in funding. Continuing resolu-
tions (CRs) slow the pace of scientific inno-
vation and create funding uncertainty for re-
searchers and students. It is vital that Con-
gress complete appropriations this year and 
avoid serial stop-gap measures and a year-
long CR. 
COALITION ON HUMAN NEEDS 
The nation’s recovery depends on strength-
ening a host of domestic programs that have 
been allowed to shrink for years, not just to 
get to where they had been before, but to re-
spond to needs far greater because of the 
pandemic and its global economic disloca-
tions. A long-term continuing resolution 
would be a severe failure to address these 
needs. We strongly urge you to enact omni-
bus appropriations legislation including all 
twelve bills as soon as possible. 
JOINT COALITION OF THE CAMPAIGN TO INVEST 
IN
AMERICAN’S
WORKFORCE, THE
COALITION 
FOR
HEALTH
FUNDING, THE
COALITION
ON 
HUMAN NEEDS, AND THE COMMITTEE FOR EDU-
CATION FUNDING 
The bill passed by the House this summer 
and the bill proposed by the Senate Appro-
priations Committee this fall provide vital 
increased funding for the programs and serv-
ices that have a profound impact on health 
and well-being, child development, edu-
cational and skills attainment, employment, 
and productivity. Failing to enact the FY 
2022 bill and relying on continuing resolu-
tions (CRs) would be a grave missed oppor-
tunity to improve the lives of all Americans. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATION 
We cannot stress enough the importance of 
the defense appropriations bill to our na-
tional security and to a healthy defense in-
dustrial base. The limbo caused under CRs 
wastes precious time and money our nation 
cannot recover. Delayed new starts and ini-
tiatives place a strain on companies and 
their workforce, particularly as they recali-
brate operations to a post-pandemic normal. 
Our nation’s competitors face no similar 
challenges putting us at a competitive dis-
advantage, particularly with emerging tech-
nologies, and place our supply chains at in-
creasing risk, something we cannot afford 
after the nearly two years of pandemic im-
pacts. 
VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING 
THE AMERICAN LEGION AND THE VETERANS OF 
FOREIGN WARS 
A full-year continuing resolution could re-
sult in an estimated $7 billion shortfall in 
funding for mandatory compensation and 
pension benefits, in large part due to an in-
creased number of benefit claims resulting 
from congressional approval of new diseases 
related to Agent Orange exposure for Viet-
nam veterans . . . we call on you to reject 
consideration of a full-year continuing reso-
lution that would reduce veterans’ funding 
below what has already been approved in an 
overwhelming bipartisan vote.

Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND MI-
NORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: On behalf of the 
millions of veterans our organizations rep-
resent, we write to express serious concerns 
about reports that the Senate is considering 
approving a full-year continuing resolution 
to fund the federal government for the re-
mainder of fiscal year 2022, which would have 
significant negative consequences for vet-
erans, their families, caregivers and sur-
vivors. Therefore, we are asking that you 
work together to ensure that veterans pro-
grams, benefits and medical services receive 
the full level of funding for fiscal year 2022 
that was approved with strong bipartisan 
support (25 to 5) by the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee in August. 
As you know, Congress approved and the 
President signed a short-term continuing 
resolution (Public Law 117–43) on September 
30th to fund the federal government through 
December 3, 2021, extending funding at the 
levels previously enacted in fiscal year 2021 
appropriations legislation. Funding for De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical 
care and benefit payments for fiscal year 2022 
was previously approved in December 2020 as 
advance appropriations in Division J (Mili-
tary Construction and Veterans Affairs) of 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, 
Public Law 116–260. However, the advance ap-
propriations process only works properly if 
funding levels are adjusted to address in-
creased demand for benefits and services as 
part of the following year’s regular appro-
priations process, as is necessary for fiscal 
year 2022. Further, if Congress passes a full- 
year continuing resolution, all other pro-
grams, services and benefits would remain 
funded at fiscal year 2021 levels, which would 
fall short of the anticipated needs. 
For example, a full-year continuing resolu-
tion could result in an estimated $7 billion 
shortfall in funding for mandatory com-
pensation and pension benefits, in large part 
due to an increased number of benefit claims 
resulting from congressional approval of new 
diseases related to Agent Orange exposure 
for Vietnam veterans. 
In addition, the time it takes to process 
these and other claims for benefits would be 
significantly increased without the $300 mil-
lion increase for the Veterans Benefits Ad-
ministration approved by the Senate Appro-
priations Committee. Similarly, reductions 
from the Committee-approved levels for the 
Board of Veterans’ Appeals and the National 
Cemetery Administration would negatively 
impact veterans and their survivors seeking 
their services and benefits. 
Enacting a full-year continuing resolution 
would also negatively hamper veterans’ abil-
ity to receive timely medical care absent the 
$3.3 billion increase for Veterans Medical 
Community Care approved by the Senate 
Committee. VA’s critical Medical and Pros-
thetic Research programs would be cut by 
$67 million and funding to support VA’s 
health care infrastructure would be cut $450 
million below the levels approved by the 
Committee if Congress passes a full-year 
continuing resolution. 
As leaders of the Senate, we call on you to 
reject consideration of a full-year continuing 
resolution that would reduce veterans’ fund-
ing below what has already been approved in 
an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the Sen-
ate Appropriations Committee. Instead, we 
ask that you use your influence to ensure 
that the Senate completes consideration of 
the fiscal year 2022 appropriations so that 
veterans, their families, caregivers and sur-
vivors have timely access to all the benefits, 
services and medical care they have earned.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADERS SCHU-
MER, MCCARTHY, AND MCCONNELL: I write on 
behalf of America’s leading research univer-
sities to urge you to reach a bipartisan 
agreement to complete the FY22 appropria-
tions process before the end of the year. 
Recent suggestions that final FY22 appro-
priations could be delayed until March 2022 
are distressing. Higher education, research, 
and innovation play integral roles in our na-
tion’s competitiveness, security, health, and 
ability to combat and overcome the pan-
demic. Our nation cannot afford continued

inaction on FY22 appropriations. In the ab-
sence of final appropriations, federal agen-
cies postpone research award decisions and 
prepare for potential lapses in funding. Con-
tinuing resolutions (CRs) slow the pace of 
scientific innovation and create funding un-
certainty for researchers and students. It is 
vital that Congress complete appropriations 
this year and avoid serial stop-gap measures 
and a year-long CR. 
Congress has made good progress in deter-
mining FY22 funding levels, and now it is 
time to finish the job. Both the House and 
Senate bills include important increases to 
federal investments in student aid and re-
search that would help bolster our nation’s 
economic competitiveness and standing as 
the global innovation leader. For example, 
the bills propose a $400 increase to the Pell 
Grant maximum award and increased fund-
ing for other student aid programs, the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the National 
Science Foundation, the Department of En-
ergy’s Office of Science, and other critical 
research agencies. AAU supports the pro-
posed increases, and we stand ready to rein-
force efforts to ensure final passage. 
We urge you to complete FY22 appropria-
tions before the end of the year and to ap-
prove the highest levels of funding proposed 
for student aid and research programs in the 
House and Senate bills. Thank you for con-
sidering our views. 
Sincerely, 
BARBARA R. SNYDER, 
President. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader of the House of Representatives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut has 30 sec-
onds remaining. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chair of the Appropriations 
Committee for yielding me 1 minute. 
I rise to say, of course, everybody is 
going to vote for this bill. I wish I be-
lieved that. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is a dem-
onstration of the failure of 535 adults 
elected by their fellow citizens to act 
responsibly. Obviously, of those 535, a 
number have acted responsibly, have 
worked to get the job done. 
There are really only 12 bills that 
need to pass the Congress. There are 
many other bills that are important 
bills and should pass the Congress that 
I voted for and make life better for 
America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HOYER. How is that? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut had 30 sec-
onds remaining. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman, 
who is my friend, and I thank him for 
that. 
As I was saying, this is a failure. We 
knew that these 12 bills have to pass. 
Why? Because if they do not, govern-
ment shuts down. It stops serving the 
American people. It stops maintaining 
security and health and welfare of our 
people. So we know these bills have to 
pass. 
But notwithstanding that, year after 
year after year, we come to this point 
where we are adopting a CR. It is really 
a CI, congressional irresponsibility. 
Now let me say that I generally 
speak of the Congress, but very frank-
ly, Madam Speaker, we have exercised 
our responsibility in this House. We 
passed 9 of the 12 appropriation bills 
and sent them to the Senate. 
b 1615 
The Senate, Madam Speaker, has not 
sent a single bill to the House, not 
passed a single appropriations bill 
through the United States Senate. 
They have passed through some in 
committee. 
I heard my friend TOM COLE speaking 
earlier on the rule. He is my friend, and 
he is a Member I respect. He is a mem-
ber of the Appropriations Committee 
and the Rules Committee. He is a Mem-
ber who respects this institution. But I 
disagree with him very much about 
why we are at a CR. We passed over-
whelmingly 75 percent of the appro-
priation bills before August 1 and sent 
them to the Senate. They have neither 
acted on those bills nor have they 
acted on their own bills and asked to 
go to conference. 
So we find ourselves at the 11th hour, 
as we did on September 30—although 
we passed the CR a little before Sep-
tember 30—without having funded the 
government. 
The gentleman referred to the fact 
that we control both Houses. Frankly, 
nobody controls the United States Sen-
ate. We are in the majority by one. 
But, 
unfortunately, 
in 
the 
United 
States Senate, you need not a major-
ity; you need a supermajority. So the 
minority can defeat the majority. 
The minority can defeat the majority 
in the United States Senate. That is an 
appalling place for our democracy to 
be. I have written an op-ed in Time 
magazine on that issue, and it has been 
distributed to many Members. 
Mr. COLE made an assessment about 
why the CR is coming to the floor 
today with just hours to go before it 
expires. His assessment was not cor-
rect. The reason we have not gotten, as 
the gentlewoman has pointed out, to 
even the opportunity to discuss a reso-
lution of the differences between the 
House and the Senate on spending lev-
els and the objects of that spending is 
because Senate Republicans have re-
fused to negotiate and made as a condi-
tion precedent—as we lawyers say, 
something that has to happen before 
you do something else—that we resolve 
all the riders. 
Now, for any of us who have been in-
volved in the appropriation process for 
any period of time, the riders are al-
most always the last items to be re-
solved, invariably. I served as an active 
member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee for 23 years, and for the last 16 
years, I have been very much involved 
in working with the Appropriations 
Committee to get these bills passed. 
Because of the refusal to even sit 
down and determine how much money 
we will spend overall, which is called in 
our jargon 302(a) numbers, the chair-
man has been unable to get to a discus-
sion of the differences so that they 
could be resolved. If you can’t discuss, 
you can’t resolve. 
So for Mr. COLE, frankly, to have in-
timated that somehow it was the 
Democrats that couldn’t do it, it takes 
two to tango, and frankly, one of the 
partners in the Senate doesn’t want to 
tango until something happens that al-
most always happens at the end. 
The timing for the consideration of 
this CR resulted not from the major-
ity’s focus on passing critical legisla-
tion to help the American people get 
ahead, the Build Back Better Act, the 
infrastructure bill which, by the way, 
only 13 Republicans voted for, but my 
speculation is at least half of them are 
going to take credit for what was done 
in that bill, maybe all of them. It is as 
a result, this failure, of the minority’s 
determination to slow down the work 
of Congress so that such legislation is 
delayed. 
As a matter of fact, the minority 
leader of the United States Senate said 
exactly that. He said that he would not 
consider negotiating on the CR until 
Build Back Better was done, which 
means he is prepared to shut down the 
government. I think that is probably 
not true. I don’t think he wants to shut 
down 
the 
government. 
I 
hope 
he 
doesn’t want to shut down the govern-
ment. 
He wants to gum up the works on 
Build Back Better. I get that. He is op-
posed to it. He doesn’t like it. He 
thinks it is the wrong priorities. That 
is an honest position to take. I think it 
is incorrect, but it is honest. But don’t 
do it by playing games with the appro-
priation process. 
In my view, the Senate treats the ap-
propriation process as a back-burner 
issue. When we get to it, we will get to 
it, but we have a lot of other things we 
want to do first. For the last 10, 11 
months, that is what the case has been. 
To dissemble and derail the legisla-
tive process using every tool available 
to them to prohibit Congress from 
doing exactly what the American peo-
ple are looking for us to do is not re-
sponsible. How sad. How shameful that 
reality is. 
I agree that it is unfortunate that we 
have to take up another stopgap meas-
ure this week to keep this government 
operating. If it were based upon wheth-
er this is the right thing to do in terms 
of substance, I would vote ‘‘no.’’ But it 
absolutely is the right thing to do in 
terms of process. 
But the chair is absolutely right; we 
need to pass an omnibus. I would hope 
that every Republican after, hopefully, 
passing this piece of legislation today

or tomorrow will then address how we 
are going to have an omnibus, how we 
are going to deal with the problems, 
how we are going to give the govern-
ment agencies that which they need to 
meet new challenges that were not 
available to us a year ago and so they 
could not be addressed. 
It is extremely disappointing that 
Senate 
Republicans 
are 
blocking 
progress toward full-year appropria-
tions that will enable our government 
to serve the American people. I happen 
to believe that the ranking member, 
Senator SHELBY, wants to see an omni-
bus passed. I believe that. But I believe 
the tactics of the Republican leader-
ship in the Senate are not to do so 
until they get what they want. 
That is dangerous for our country, 
and it is extraordinarily inefficient for 
the 2 million people who are waiting to 
see what we are doing. That is what 
they are focused on, not the job, not 
the priorities, not the dangers, but 
what is happening: Is the government 
going to fund us on Saturday? On Sat-
urday, are we going to be able to oper-
ate? 
There are few certainties in Wash-
ington, Madam Speaker, but one of 
them has now become that Congress 
will not complete the appropriation 
process by the start of the fiscal year. 
I have tried to make that happen every 
year that I have been majority leader. 
The chair of this committee, ROSA 
DELAURO, did everything she could to 
pass 12 appropriation bills by the Au-
gust 1 deadline. If we had had any help 
on the Republican side, we would have 
done it—any help. 
Now, we have only a four-vote mar-
gin over here, so on some of the bills 
that were more controversial for one 
reason or another, we needed some 
help. I will remind my friend—and I 
dearly thank him for yielding me the 
time. He knew it was going to be a 
somewhat extended discussion, but I 
thank him for that. It reflects back to 
how this institution used to operate, 
frankly, and I appreciate it. But he 
knows that when the Republican side 
was in the majority, and they could 
not get the majority of votes on fiscal 
issues, they looked to this side of the 
aisle. We always helped and made it 
happen; maybe not 100 percent of us, 
but a large enough amount so that the 
important fiscal issues would be dealt 
with and passed. 
Only six times over the past 20 years 
has Congress come within 3 months of 
this deadline, the end of the fiscal year. 
Now, I could go on for some period of 
time talking about Mr. COLE. He said 
the majority wasn’t serious. We are 
very serious. We have been the ones 
that opened up government after it was 
shut down for some 35 days when we 
took over from the Republican leader-
ship two Congresses ago. We can do 
better. 
For Mr. COLE to say that we were 
spending time pandering to the Amer-
ican people by passing the Build Back 
Better Act or passing the bipartisan in-
frastructure act, I hope he reflects 
upon that statement and says, no, that 
was wrong. Yes, we focused on Build 
Back Better because we think it is im-
portant for the American people, but 
we had already passed the appropria-
tion bills. They were already in the 
Senate ready to be acted upon, and we 
were ready to act in response. 
Madam Speaker, this is the result of 
the inability of the Congress to work. 
The House worked. Republicans and 
Democrats, 
this 
House 
can 
work. 
Maybe sometimes I don’t agree with 
what it does, and maybe sometimes my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
don’t agree with what it does, but it 
works. It can pass legislation. 
The Senate is not working, and it is 
hurting our country. 
We should all resolve, however we 
vote on this CR, we should all resolve, 
hopefully, all of us—and I am a good 
friend of the ranking member, Ms. 
GRANGER. I think she wants to get this 
bill done. By ‘‘this bill,’’ I am talking 
about omnibus, all 12 appropriation 
bills. I think she wants to get that 
done. But I am not sure that she has 
been empowered by her leadership to 
do so. 
We can have differences, and we have 
a way of resolving those differences. 
Ultimately, we vote. But if we keep 
putting it off, putting it off, putting it 
off, it undermines the credibility of the 
United States, the confidence that peo-
ple have in our country, the confidence 
that our workers have in our steward-
ship of the leadership of this country, 
and the people’s confidence. So we 
ought to resolve that we stop this. 
The Republicans, through Mr. COLE, 
have talked about a motion to recom-
mit. It mirrors the unserious nature of 
their opposition. Why do I say that? 
Because their motion to recommit has 
nothing to do with the funding of gov-
ernment. It has nothing to do with our 
responsibility to ensure that govern-
ment continues to work on behalf of 
the American people. Rather, it would 
send this bill back to committee and 
would not possibly be able to act in a 
timely fashion that some 30 hours from 
now, I guess 311⁄2 hours from now, gov-
ernment would shut down. 
I would have understood perhaps a 
motion that would have said we are 
going to fund government at this level, 
or we are going to fund this objective 
and not that objective, but that is not 
what it did, totally irrelevant to the 
appropriations process bill. They may 
think it is an important issue. I get 
that. But it doesn’t have anything to 
do with this issue. 
Very frankly, that is exactly what 
the Senate has been doing on the Re-
publican side, irrelevant issues, not the 
appropriations process. So we find our-
selves now at a time when we must 
pass this CR. 
I am not in love with this CR, but in 
a world of alternatives, there should be 
none for any of us. All of us should 
have the courage to be responsible. 
Madam Speaker, all of us should have 
the courage to say there is no alter-
native, and after we pass this bill and 
the Senate passes this bill, get down to 
the work between now and February 18. 
I would hope we could pass an omni-
bus appropriation bill including the 
work of the gentleman from California, 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut, 
and all the rest of us on the priorities 
that we want to pursue as an American 
people and the investments that we 
want to make in achieving those objec-
tives. I hope we do that. 
b 1630 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I would like to remind my 
friends in the majority, we don’t run 
the House, we don’t run the White 
House, and God only knows who runs 
the Senate. 
But I do know this, that the gen-
tleman that the majority leader re-
ferred to, the ranking minority mem-
ber in the United States Senate cer-
tainly wants an appropriation bill, but 
I think he has made it quite clear, and 
I think we have made it quite clear— 
the gentleman referred to Mr. COLE—I 
think he has made it quite clear that 
the legacy riders, which need to come 
back in, the poison pills have got to go 
out, the dollars, by the way, which we 
have not agreed to in defense spending 
because, as you know, the Committee 
on Appropriations did not agree to a 
number that passed in the United 
States House of Representatives. It did 
pass by the authorization committee at 
a higher number, and in the Senate by 
a higher number, both Republicans and 
Democrats. 
So I think we recognize that defense 
number has to go up and something 
else has to come down. If those things 
happen, I think we can have a serious 
negotiation. Until then, I am afraid we 
are going to be continuing to operate 
on a continuing resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the CR. 
The American people are $29 trillion in 
debt, thanks to Congress. And this Con-
gress wants to borrow more money and 
more time to figure out how to run the 
government and how to pay for it. That 
is an outrage to the American people. 
You want to talk about courage and 
responsibility? Do you know what 
courage and responsibility is? 
It is learning how to manage the peo-
ple’s money. The people work hard 
every single day. They have to pay the 
taxes. And then they have to trust this 
House, this body, and the Senate to 
create a budget, but every single time, 
it is the budget that puts them further 
and further in debt. 
It is the audacity of Congress to bor-
row more money and not be able to 
come up with a budget that makes 
sense and that we can pay for.

December 2, 2021 
What an outrage. What an irrespon-
sibility. That isn’t courage. That is not 
responsibility. That is out-of-control 
behavior that this Congress needs to 
rein in. This government should be 
shut down. You want to know why it 
should be shut down? Because the peo-
ple in here cannot control themselves. 
The people in here do not understand 
how to balance a checkbook. And the 
people in here do not deserve the re-
sponsibility on how to spend the Amer-
ican people’s money. 
Madam Speaker, $29 trillion. Shut it 
down. Do not pass the CR. Shut it 
down. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, as I said before, the 
fiscal year 2022 bills were drafted with 
little input from Republicans. And 
since then, we have not been able to 
find a path forward. 
In years past, we have had an agree-
ment in place that allowed us to nego-
tiate final bills quickly. I am con-
cerned that we cannot have a meaning-
ful discussion on full-year appropria-
tions without a similar understanding 
going in. 
Madam Speaker, that is why, in a few 
moments, I will offer a motion to re-
commit. My motion would simply send 
this bill back to committee so that we 
can come to agreement on a process for 
addressing full-year bills. 
Madam Speaker, to return to our 
strong bipartisan traditions, I urge 
support for the motion, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 829, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Calvert moves to recommit the bill, 
H.R. 6119, to the Committee on Appropria-
tions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 2(b) of rule XIX, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the motion 
to recommit. 
The question is on the motion to re-
commit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR 
OF THE VICTIMS OF THE OX-
FORD HIGH SCHOOL TRAGEDY 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, this has 
been one of the darkest and most pain-
ful weeks our State of Michigan has 
had in recent memory. We stand here, 
the Michigan delegation of Democrats 
and Republicans, along with honorary 
Michiganians, to ask Congress to rec-
ognize that pain and to ask Members 
here to see their own children in the 
pictures of those who were lost in yet 
another school shooting. 
In less than 5 minutes, the small 
town of Oxford, Michigan, was changed 
forever when a gunman opened fire on 
his fellow high school students. 
In that momentary flash, four inno-
cent teenagers, students with their en-
tire lives ahead of them, were taken 
from us in yet another senseless act of 
violence. 
Hana St. Juliana was an exuberant 
freshman and a volleyball and basket-
ball player. She babysat for a friend of 
mine and brought joy to everyone who 
knew her. She made her high school 
debut on the basketball team on Mon-
day night. Hana was 14 years old. 
Madisyn Baldwin was going to grad-
uate this year, and she had already 
been accepted to several colleges, some 
with a full scholarship. She had a 
younger half-brother and two sisters, 
and her friends describe her as an art-
ist who loved to draw, read, and write. 
Madisyn was 17. 
Tate Myre was a tight end and run-
ning back on the varsity football team 
and an honor student. There is already 
a petition circulating to rename Ox-
ford’s football stadium in his honor. He 
was 16 years old. 
Justin Shilling was a senior getting 
ready for life after high school. He was 
the co-captain of the school’s bowling 
team, and he worked part-time at 
Anita’s Kitchen, a restaurant in nearby 
Lake Orion. Justin was 17. 
Seven others were wounded, and 
make no mistake, every single student, 
parent, friend, family member, and 
community member in the greater area 
now has wounds that you can’t see, the 
wounds that affect the head and the 
heart. 
Last night, I attended a service at a 
church where many Oxford families at-
tend. The pastor spoke for many when 
he asked: ‘‘Where do we go with our 
fears? We feel powerless to prevent this 
kind 
of 
tragedy. 
We 
mourn 
the 
brokenness of a culture where children 
kill children.’’ 
Today I ask my colleagues from 
across the country to join me in a mo-
ment of silence to honor the lives of 
Hana, Madisyn, Tate, and Justin. 
I ask you for this moment to put 
yourself in the shoes of the families in 
places like Columbine, Sandy Hook, 
Parkland, Santa Fe, Noblesville, and 
now Oxford, Michigan. 
And I ask you to refuse to be power-
less in the powerful body that is the 
U.S. Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House ob-
serve a moment of silence in honor of 
the victims of the Oxford High School 
tragedy. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
for the purpose of inquiring of the ma-
jority leader the schedule for next 
week. I yield to my friend, the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), to 
talk about the schedule for next week. 
b 1815 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, pending Senate pas-
sage of the CR tonight without amend-
ment, the House will not be in session 
tomorrow—I want to reiterate, pending 
passage of the CR tonight. If the CR is 
not passed, we will be in session tomor-
row at 9. 
If the Senate fails to act, as I just 
said, we will meet at 9 a.m. for legisla-
tive business and expect to vote on 
some of the postponed suspensions. 
Members are encouraged to keep their 
schedules flexible as we work to fully 
fund government and prevent a shut-
down at 12 midnight tomorrow night. 
Next week, on Monday, pending Sen-
ate action on full government funding 
and H.R. 6119, the Further Extending 
Government Act, being signed into law, 
the House is no longer expected to 
meet. This is a change from our pre-
viously announced schedule. We will 
not be in session Monday, assuming we 
have funded the government. 
On Tuesday, the House will meet at 
12 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for 
legislative business. 
On Wednesday and Thursday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning 
hour and 12 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness. 
On Friday, the House will meet at 9 
a.m. for legislative business, as was 
previously scheduled. 
The House will consider several bills 
under suspension of the rules. The com-
plete list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business to-
morrow. 
Additionally, the House will pass 
H.R. 4350, the National Defense Author-
ization Act, again, a second time, to 
provide our troops with the pay they 
deserve and our military with the tools 
it needs to carry out its missions safely 
and effectively, keep America safe, and 
keep the peace. 
Again, I will reiterate that is the sec-
ond time we will pass this version. As 
I understand it, it will be the con-
ference-agreed version of the defense 
bill. This has been a discussion between 
the House and the Senate. 
The House will also consider H.R. 
8363, the Protecting Our Democracy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6893 
December 2, 2021 
Act, to reassert Congress’ role as a co-
equal branch of government by ad-
dressing the vulnerabilities exploited 
by 
the 
former 
President 
and 
his 
enablers to weaken our democracy, un-
dermine the rule of law, and subvert 
the systems of checks and balances en-
shrined by the Framers in our Con-
stitution. 
The House may also consider legisla-
tion to address the debt limit and pre-
vent a manufactured economic catas-
trophe that would derail our recovery 
from the pandemic and cause needless 
suffering to millions of American fami-
lies. 
I would reiterate that while we don’t 
know the exact date at which America 
will be unable to pay its bills, we will 
address this next week, hopefully, in a 
bipartisan fashion. 
Moreover, the House will be ready to 
act on H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better 
Act, should the Senate amend it and 
send it back to the House. 
Lastly, of course, additional legisla-
tive items are possible. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for that update. 
As it relates to tomorrow’s schedule, as 
the gentleman from Maryland said, it 
could be fluid, depending on how the 
CR is processed in the Senate. If the 
CR does not pass the Senate tonight, 
are there bills that are specifically des-
ignated to come up tomorrow, or is 
that a to-be-determined issue? 
Mr. HOYER. We have a list of suspen-
sion bills, which has been announced 
and has been on our calendar for con-
sideration. Those would be the pieces 
of legislation with which we would 
deal, pending action by the Senate. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for that update. 
As it relates to the debt ceiling, we 
had a discussion a few weeks ago relat-
ing to the debt ceiling. Would there be 
a bipartisan negotiation? We haven’t 
had that so far. Is there anticipation 
that there would be a plan to try to en-
gage both sides in a negotiation on the 
debt ceiling, or is this something that 
we are just going to have to wait to see 
next week? 
Mr. HOYER. Well, I think we will 
probably have to wait to see exactly 
what is going to happen. As the gen-
tleman knows, we have passed a debt 
limit twice through this House. There 
has been a problem in the Senate, and 
I would expect Senator SCHUMER and 
Senator MCCONNELL will be discussing 
that in the next few days. 
Senator MCCONNELL has made it very 
clear that he thinks that failing to pro-
tect the full faith and credit of the 
United States of America would have 
dire adverse consequences, so he has 
made it very clear he thinks we ought 
not to do that. Senator SCHUMER has 
done the same. 
Essentially, my answer to the gen-
tleman is, we have passed it twice in 
one form or another, so we can pass it 
and will pass it once the Senate agrees 
on a version. The two leaders are dis-
cussing that, I am sure. Now, I haven’t 
talked to either one of them, but that 
is my premise. 
Mr. SCALISE. Well, then we will see 
what develops from that discussion. 
As it relates to the National Defense 
Authorization Act, and as the gen-
tleman pointed out, we are aware there 
are bipartisan negotiations between 
both the House and Senate, Repub-
licans and Democrats. 
I share the hope and expectation that 
they can come to an agreement. There 
are a few final details that both sides 
are trying to work out. I think they 
have already agreed, which we both 
share, that our troops deserve a pay 
raise, need a pay raise, and that num-
ber has been agreed to. 
Hopefully, that is part of this, as well 
as the proper funding levels for our Na-
tion’s defense as we see threats emerg-
ing throughout the world. We also 
know the detriment of not having prop-
er defense funding because they can’t 
enter into the contracts that are nec-
essary. 
Both of those conversations seem to 
be, from what we are hearing, going 
well. Hopefully, that is a bill that can 
come to the floor next week, and we 
can all come together to help pass 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman for any comments. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman, and I agree with 
his comments. It is my understanding, 
although I haven’t talked personally, 
but it is my understanding that intro-
ducing the conference-agreed bill in 
the House, and passing it through the 
House will, under Senate procedures, 
facilitate them resolving this issue, 
hopefully, in a positive way next week. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, there 
are two specific pieces of legislation I 
would like to ask the gentleman to 
look at. 
One is, by the end of the year, as you 
know, there are some potential cuts 
coming to entities like Medicare if 
Congress doesn’t take action. There is 
a bipartisan bill that members of the 
Doctors Caucus and other members of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and other committees of juris-
diction have worked on. It is H.R. 6020. 
That would stave off those cuts to our 
healthcare providers. 
It would need to be passed by the end 
of the year—otherwise, those cuts 
would automatically kick in—if the 
gentleman could take a look at that 
bill and see if that is something we 
could do in a bipartisan way before we 
leave for the year. 
Another would be, you and I have had 
this conversation successfully on other 
legislation dealing with ALS. The 
Steve Gleason Act was one of those; 
there are others. I have spoken to 
Steve Gleason recently. There is a 
piece of legislation that we were able 
to work on that got out of the Com-
mittee 
on 
Energy 
and 
Commerce 
unanimously. It is H.R. 3537, the Accel-
erating Access to Critical Therapies for 
ALS Act. 
I would just ask if the gentleman 
could look at that bill. It came out 
unanimously, 
bipartisan, 
from 
the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
and it is something that, obviously, 
would help a lot of people who could 
use that help. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I agree 
with the gentleman. We have talked to 
the sponsor, and we have talked to oth-
ers. I expect this bill to be on the floor 
next week. 
Mr. SCALISE. Well, that would be 
great news to so many people across 
the country. 
Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman would 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. With respect to the 
issues that I think we have broad 
agreement on, the cliffs that were cre-
ated on Medicare and sequester are not 
good policy, and we ought to act on 
those. We are very seized of that issue, 
and hopefully, we can resolve some-
thing next week. 
The gentleman mentions doing it in a 
bipartisan fashion. The good news is, 
and I know the gentleman will agree, 
that earlier this year, we delayed to 
January 1 of this coming year these 
items, particularly the 2 percent se-
quester by a vote of 90–2 in the Senate, 
meaning only two people voted against 
it, and in the House, 384. We were unan-
imous on our side, but you had the 
overwhelming majority on your side as 
well. So by 384–38, we extended that. 
I am hopeful that we will do that 
again in a bipartisan way because not 
to do so, I think, would be very harm-
ful to the medical community, to the 
country, and, obviously, to patients 
that are served by the medical commu-
nity. 
I am hopeful that we can resolve that 
as early as next week. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
share that sentiment the gentleman 
had, and hopefully, we can achieve 
those bipartisan victories. 
As you mentioned, H.R. 3537 would be 
a tremendous victory for people who 
struggle with ALS to continue to seek 
out new therapies and be able to live 
their lives in the best way possible. I 
appreciate the gentleman’s past efforts 
as well as the offer to bring that bill to 
the floor next week. 
Madam Speaker, if the gentleman 
doesn’t have anything else, I thank the 
gentleman, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6894 
December 2, 2021 
My own daughter was not in school 
today and will not be tomorrow due to 
threats of copycat violence. Many 
school districts across metro Detroit 
have closed altogether. 
This is a terrifying time to be a par-
ent, a school professional, a law en-
forcement officer, and, Lord knows, a 
child. 
This was the deadliest school shoot-
ing since 2018, the year our children 
rose up and asked us to take action. 
The House has passed several bills to 
curb gun violence, yet Congress as a 
whole has not enacted a single new law 
for our kids. 
This father urges our colleagues in 
the Senate to act, no more thoughts 
and prayers, but to act at long last. 
I send my deepest condolences to the 
families and friends of Hana, Tate, 
Madisyn, and Justin. When we say 
never again, let’s mean it this time. 
f 
WARREN COUNTY TAX HOLIDAY 
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, infla-
tion is at the highest level that we 
have seen in decades and rising. The 
cost of buying a home is up. The cost 
to fill your gas tank is up. The cost to 
feed your family is up. Even the cost of 
buying Christmas presents for your 
children or grandchildren is up. 
While the pandemic certainly bears 
some blame, the failed policies of the 
Biden administration have made things 
considerably worse. His administration 
and his allies here in Congress have 
spent trillions of dollars that we don’t 
have, which inevitably will lead to 
higher taxes and higher prices for 
items that hardworking Americans buy 
every day. 
Despite the bad news nationally, one 
county in my congressional district ac-
tually has good news for its residents. 
Warren County Commissioners Tom 
Grossmann, Shannon Jones, and David 
Young announced recently that they 
would not be collecting property taxes 
from their residents this year. The 
commissioners are able to do this by 
exercising fiscal responsibility, as we 
ought to do here in the House, and put-
ting aside money for a rainy day, rath-
er than spending money that they 
didn’t have. 
Kudos to the Warren County commis-
sioners for giving their taxpayers a lit-
tle extra holiday cheer this year. 
f 
A DIMINISHED SUPREME COURT 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
COHEN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
mourn the loss of the Supreme Court of 
the United States of America. 
As a lawyer, I have always had re-
spect for the Court as the highest court 
in the land dispensing justice, but 
starting with Bush v. Gore, it became 
more political. 
In Shelby v. Holder, it emasculated 
the Voting Rights Act, destroying sec-
tion 5 and taking the basic funda-
mental principles of democracy away 
from so many people. 
In Citizens United, it gave the rich 
and the powerful more and more 
money. 
And then yesterday, it took away 
women’s right to choose. 
To hear some of the arguments from 
Justice Kavanaugh, to say abortion is 
not in the Constitution so we should 
leave it to the States, well, high-speed 
internet is not in the Constitution ei-
ther, but the courts can hear cases on 
that. Nuclear power is not in the Con-
stitution, but the Court will hear cases 
on that. 
To hear Justice Barrett say women 
can just go a little longer and give 
birth to those children because there 
will be somebody there that wants to 
adopt that child, deciding for the 
mothers that they will have to bear 
that child might cost them their life. 
Childbearing is not without risk and 
takes them away from other things. 
Unfortunately, the Court is very di-
minished.

MANIPULATION OF GAS PRICES 
(Mr. FITZGERALD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
the 
Biden 
administration’s 
energy 
agenda is a disaster. The President’s 
decision to cancel the Keystone XL 
pipeline cost hundreds of jobs in Wis-
consin and undermined our Nation’s 
energy independence, and his policies 
have made energy prices soar. 
As a result, the American people are 
paying the price at the gas pump. Part 
of my district, the Fifth Congressional 
District in southeastern Wisconsin, is 
an EPA-designated ozone nonattain-
ment zone, another contributor to the 
very high gas prices that we are seeing. 
This designation requires area gas 
stations to use more expensive, refor-
mulated gasoline. The increased cost of 
the reformulated gas is passed on to 
consumers, resulting in gas prices 10 to 
15 cents higher in some counties in my 
district, compared to the county right 
next to it. 
The irony is that President Biden is 
blaming oil and gas companies for ma-
nipulating gas prices and is encour-
aging the FTC to investigate. In re-
ality, it is the administration’s old, 
failed policies that are responsible for 
the manipulation of the gas prices. The 
truth is Americans cannot afford this 
way of life. 
f 
MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES 
AMONG BLACK WOMEN 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because the maternal health cri-
sis in this country is dire, with the 
United States being the only developed 
country in the world experiencing a 
rise in maternal mortality rates. 
It is even more dire for Black women, 
who are three to four times more likely 
to die from pregnancy-related com-
plications. 
This is no coincidence. For centuries, 
systemic racism has harmed the men-
tal, physical, and economic well-being 
of Black and Brown people. Thanks to 
the leadership of Black women in Con-
gress, 
Congresswoman 
UNDERWOOD, 
Congresswoman 
SEWELL, 
Congress-
woman ADAMS, and more, who are driv-
ing the momnibus, this body is work-
ing to bring us out of a Black maternal 
health crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I rise for my sisters 
and their babies who are more than a 
statistic and deserve to be holistically 
treated and cared for. Black moms 
matter. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
momnibus and join us in our effort to 
protect Black women and Black moth-
ers.

RECOGNIZING 
BRIGADIER 
GEN-
ERAL WILLIAM ‘‘ROBBIE’’ ROB-
ERTSON ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to commemorate the service of Briga-
dier General William ‘‘Robbie’’ Robert-
son on his retirement from the Illinois 
Air National Guard. 
A Peoria native, General Robertson 
served 41 years in the Armed Forces, 
much of it as a member of Peoria’s 
182nd Airlift Wing of the Illinois Na-
tional Guard. He served in various ca-
pacities as a security policeman, a 
pilot, a forward air controller, chief of 
operations, wing commander, and chief 
of staff for the Illinois Air National 
Guard. 
General Robertson was integral in 
making the 182nd one of the best C–130 
units in the country. During General 
Robertson’s time at the 182nd, the unit 
earned five Air Force Outstanding Unit 
Awards, and nine times reached the 
highest C–130 Hercules mission capable 
rates in Air Mobility Command. 
General Robertson is known through-
out the Peoria community for his 
steady leadership and integrity. He is 
beloved by those who worked with him 
and know him. 
I want to thank him for his service to 
our country and to our community and 
wish him well in his retirement.

sas Museum in Little Rock. Currently, 
Gordon serves as the secretary of the 
Historic Arkansas Museum Commis-
sion. This year will mark Gordon’s 50th

For half of those years, I have been 
fortunate to work alongside Gordon, an 
exceptional attorney and civic leader. 
He has devoted his adult life to pre-
serving Arkansas’ rich heritage for our 
kids. 
I am proud to have served at his side

firsthand the impact that he has made 
on our State and the legacy that he is

TEMPLE 
BETH 
AM 
WELCOMES 
JEWISH 
PEOPLE 
FROM 
ALL 
WALKS OF LIFE 
(Ms. SALAZAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today, on the fifth day of Hanuk-
kah, to give special recognition to my 
Jewish community in Florida’s 27th 
Congressional District. 
As their Congresswoman, I have the 
distinct honor of representing one of 
the largest Jewish communities in the 
country, which includes Temple Beth 
Am, one of the largest congregations in 
the southeast United States. 
For over 65 years, Temple Beth Am 
has welcomed Jewish people from all 
walks of life to worship, to study, and 
to seek refuge. For over six decades, 
the synagogue has provided spiritual 
guidance and served the Miami com-
munity in so many ways. 
Much of this would have never hap-
pened without the leadership of Beth 
Am Senior Rabbi, Jeremy Barras. 
There are so many great spiritual Jew-
ish leaders in our community along 
with Rabbi Barras; Rabbi Yitzi Zweig 
of the Talmudic University Yeshiva in 
Miami Beach; Rabbi Yossi Harlig of the 
Chabad 
Center 
of 
Kendall 
and 
Pinecrest; and Rabbi Eliot Pearlson of 
Temple Menorah in Miami Beach. They 
are esteemed local leaders and pillars 
of the Miami Jewish community, and I 
call them my friends. 
Over the next few days, our Jewish 
brothers and sisters all over the world 
will continue to celebrate the Festival 
of Lights, God permitting. I offer my 
best wishes to all of them. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I have been here since the Columbine 
tragedy, which is more than 20 years 
ago. I have faced a mountain of trage-
dies in schools with children dying at 
the hands of guns. 
I offer my deepest sympathy for the 
loss of the beautiful, precious people in 
Michigan. I think a simple addition to 
this whole idea of the gun safety dis-
cussion—I intend to introduce a bill 
that is in tribute to Kimberly Vaughan 
who died in Santa Fe at the hands of a 
young gunman. I want to just simply 
say, Store your guns. 
This storage act in honor of her name 
responds to the tragedy that just hap-
pened as well because it requires manu-
facturers and retailers to sell guns 
with storage safety devices to ensure 
that those penalties for not doing so 
are ahead of the loss of life; providing 
tax credits for those who do that; and 
as well, providing grants for more in-
formation about safety devices. 
We have to do whatever we can to 
save the lives of our children. 
f 
TASKS TO DO OVER THE RECESS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
think after next week we are going to 
spend about 3 weeks back in the dis-
trict. It would be nice if people would 
go down to the southern border, as I 
did, and look at the path into Yuma, 
Texas, in which all the photo IDs are 
being thrown aside by the people who 
want to forget their past and start a 
new life in America. 
I also hope when people go back 
home, they spend some time with the 
farmers and with the manufacturers 
that make our country run. They will 
find that the cost of metals used in 
manufacturing—and I have a big manu-
facturing 
district—are 
sometimes 
going up five or six times. Not 5 or 6 
percent, five or six times. 
They will find that mucking around 
with the free market of trucking in 
California has resulted in huge short-
ages of various different things that we 
need, including chemicals needed for 
agriculture, for things like planting 
soybeans and corn. Some farmers are 
afraid that sometime in the next year 
we are going to have a food shortage. 
They will find out that the goal of 
taking away fossil fuels is going to re-
sult in significant increases in heating 
oil, which is particularly a problem in 
northern Wisconsin. 
f 
THE NEED FOR BETTER FOREST 
MANAGEMENT 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, as 
we reflect upon yet another horrific 
fire season in California and the West, 
we cannot allow ourselves to forget or 
get complacent. 
This week, we have had several good 
meetings here in D.C. with various 
groups talking about the need for bet-
ter forest management. 
This is more or less what the average 
forest looks like that is unmanaged. 
You can hardly see through it. You 
could never ride a horse through it. An 
owl can hardly fly through the thing. 
So what does this mean, an over-
crowded forest? It means fire danger. 
These trees compete for a limited 
amount of water supply. Insects attack 
and weaken trees because they don’t 
have enough water and soil nutrients. 
The right amount of trees per acre 
would look something like this. See, 
we are not cutting all the trees from 
Mexico to the Canadian border, we are 
leaving some behind, a healthier more 
sustainable forest. We will have much 
more success and much less fire dan-
ger. 
Indeed, over a million acres in my 
district burned this year—a million 
acres. That is terrible for water qual-
ity, air quality, for the wildlife, and for 
the habitat. We could do so much bet-
ter and put people back to work man-
aging our forests in a way that is bet-
ter for everybody with access to the 
forest. Let’s get on it.

CANCEL STUDENT LOAN DEBT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STRICKLAND). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. BOW-
MAN) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
BOWMAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, we are focused on Federal stu-
dent loans. 
This global pandemic, which is very 
much still with us, has been hard on 
Americans in so many ways. One 
source of relief the Federal Govern-
ment has been able to provide is the 
pause on Federal student loan pay-
ments. That pause is scheduled to end 
after January, and tens of millions of 
Americans will have to resume month-
ly payments on their loans. 
Millions of people will yet again be 
faced with terrible choices between 
paying off their loans and putting food 
on the table, paying for childcare, or 
paying medical bills. Student debt is a 
national crisis. It was a crisis before 
the COVID–19 pandemic and it is an 
even bigger one now. 
I can’t think of a better opportunity 
to cancel student loan debt. Today, 
over 40 million borrowers owe a com-
bined $1.8 trillion in loans, and the 
share of people who are able to make 
payments high enough to reduce their 
principal balance has been rapidly de-
clining. That means for years people 
have been doing all they can to make

monthly payments but can only afford 
to keep up with the interest that ac-
crues. 
If someone took out a $30,000 loan to 
go to a public State university but can 
only afford the minimum monthly pay-
ments to cover interest, they can be 
paying 
hundreds 
of 
dollars 
every 
month for years without seeing the 
total amount they owe go down at all. 
In fact, many borrowers see their debt 
increase because they can’t even keep 
up with the interest. 
b 1845 
Far too often it can take a borrower 
over a decade to pay off their loans, 
and many borrowers end up defaulting 
because they simply cannot make ends 
meet with such high payments. This 
can have lasting impacts on a person’s 
financial, mental, and physical health 
which taken all together makes it 
harder for people to fully participate in 
the economy over the long-term. 
For example, Madam Speaker, you 
can’t get a Small Business Administra-
tion loan if you have defaulted on any 
loan in the past 7 years. So many of 
our 
family 
members, 
friends, 
and 
neighbors face additional barriers to 
starting businesses because of student 
debt. They face additional barriers to 
save for retirement, buying homes, 
taking care of their health and putting 
off doctors’ visits or necessary pre-
scriptions, starting families, or pur-
suing a career they are passionate 
about. 
Students took these risks in their 
pursuit 
of 
the 
American 
Dream 
through obtaining a college degree. 
Students across America are doing ex-
actly what we asked them to do; work 
hard, study and learn deeply, grow 
your mind, develop your skills, and ex-
pand your world view. Students across 
America took these steps because we 
told them that education, particularly 
higher education, would be the great 
equalizer. We told them their hard 
work would open doors for the rest of 
their lives. 
Instead, we have shut those doors in 
their faces one by one, and we have dis-
proportionately done this to Black and 
Latino, indigenous, and poor students. 
We have preyed upon our most vulner-
able kids. 
The student debt crisis is a racial 
justice issue, and we cannot talk about 
the problem nor the solutions without 
centering the experiences of students 
and families of color and others who 
come from marginalized communities. 
Canceling student debt would mean 
putting money back into people’s pock-
ets and improving the overall economy. 
This is money that can be used to pay 
for childcare so that parents can reen-
ter the workforce and actually use the 
degree they went into debt for in the 
first place. This is money that can be 
used to start a business or buy a house 
or pay for necessary healthcare. 
This newfound freedom will open the 
door to pursue a passion or a purpose 
like teaching, nursing, or public serv-
ice rather than one that just pays the 
bills. This freedom will improve one’s 
quality of life and provide the self-de-
termination 
necessary 
for 
quality, 
long-term planning. 
Canceling student debt would go a 
long way in reducing the racial wealth 
gap and the racial homeownership gap 
and would help address many of the 
systemic barriers Black and Brown 
families face. 
It is time to cancel this predatory 
student debt to give the American peo-
ple a fresh start and accelerate both 
the economic and social well-being of 
our Nation. Our predatory debt is an 
unfair and unjust burden that has been 
hanging over the heads of borrowers 
since they decided to pursue an edu-
cation. 
That is why I, along with many Mem-
bers you will hear tonight, Madam 
Speaker, have been calling on Presi-
dent Biden to use his executive author-
ity to cancel Federal student loans. 
This authority is already being used 
right now to cancel the interest owed 
on all Federal student loans during the 
pandemic. Now it is time to use that 
same authority to cancel all Federal 
student debts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL), who will highlight many 
ways canceling students loan debt is 
urgently 
needed. 
Congresswoman 
JAYAPAL will address this House on 
this very important issue. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, Representative 
BOWMAN, for his incredible leadership. 
It has been a true honor to serve with 
the gentleman in the Progressive Cau-
cus, this Special Order hour has always 
been the Progressive Caucus’ Special 
Order hour led in his very capable 
hands and also to be able to serve with 
him on the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. The gentleman brings tremen-
dous power to the actual experience of 
education through his own background. 
I am so proud to serve with the gen-
tleman. 
Madam Speaker, I, too, am here to 
talk about the need to cancel student 
debt. This is a tremendous crisis for 36 
million 
Americans 
who 
are 
being 
crushed by $1.8 trillion in student loan 
debt. 
When I first ran for Congress in 2016, 
the number was $1.2 trillion; then it 
was $1.3 trillion, $1.5 trillion, now it is 
almost $1.8 trillion in student loan 
debt. Working families and students 
are counting on this administration to 
build us all back better. 
But many families like those I rep-
resent in Seattle cannot thrive with 
the crippling burden of student loan 
debt holding them back at every single 
turn. 
With the student loan moratorium 
expiring at the end of January, bor-
rowers are literally just a few weeks 
away from resuming to pay substantial 
amounts of their income toward stu-
dent loan payments and the crises that 
they are facing, the trauma that they 
are facing as they think about what 
they are going to do when this morato-
rium expires and how they are going to 
make these payments. Over one-quar-
ter of borrowers expect at least one- 
third of their income will go toward 
student loans once the pause ends, and 
they are terrified. Eighty-nine percent 
of full-time employed borrowers are ex-
pecting to be financially insecure come 
February 1. 
While that number is concerning, it 
should not be surprising. The economic 
toll of the pandemic has made it tough 
for one-quarter of all adults to pay 
their bills. To make ends meet, people 
have stayed afloat by using the money 
that would have gone to student loan 
payments on all the other essential 
costs that they have. Eighty-seven per-
cent of borrowers report using these 
savings to pay off other bills. 
This is personal. My office recently 
heard from a mother and a veteran in 
the Seattle area who was delinquent in 
her payments even before the first case 
of COVID–19 hit our country. She is 
glad that the pause has given her a 
chance to catch up on payments, but 
she is concerned that very soon she 
will have to choose between paying her 
mortgage and repaying her student 
loans after January. Not having to 
make 
student 
loan 
payments 
has 
helped her and her family. But should 
this pause end without student debt 
cancelation, she and her children will 
be on the path to financial ruin. We 
have the power to make sure that does 
not happen. This administration has 
the power to make sure that does not 
happen. 
The good news is that this adminis-
tration does have, as my colleague 
said, the authority to do what is right 
for families like hers and like so many 
that I have been hearing from. Clearly, 
if the pause on student loans and inter-
est was necessary to help families sus-
tain themselves through the pandemic, 
then ending it without any form of per-
manent student debt relief would be 
harmful, especially as many families 
are continuing to struggle during this 
ongoing crisis. 
Consider the tremendous strides the 
Biden administration has made toward 
reviving our struggling economy: low 
unemployment, reopened businesses, 
and vaccinations driving consumer de-
mand. Eliminating $50,000, at least, of 
student debt per borrower would in-
crease average yearly pay by $3,000 
which in turn would increase GDP by 
$1 trillion. 
Cancelation would also solidify ac-
cess to important paths for building 
the middle class which have been de-
layed due to student loan debt. More 
than 80 percent of borrowers with stu-
dent loan debt report that that debt is 
holding them back from being able to 
afford a home. Many would be in a bet-
ter position to begin saving for home-
ownership as well as retirement or 
starting a business.

Student loan forgiveness would also 
help close the wealth gap, as Mr. BOW-
MAN pointed out, especially in commu-
nities of color. Black, Latinx, and Na-
tive borrowers are more likely to 
struggle with repayments and con-
sequently default on their loans at 
higher rates. Further, it is estimated 
that Black borrowers on average owe 
nearly $53,000 in student debt, the high-
est compared to other communities. In 
fact, the average student debt for 
Black households tripled in the 12 
years following the 2008 recession with 
student debt held by Black borrowers 
being triple what White borrowers owe 
just 4 years after graduating. 
So, yes, this is clearly a matter of ra-
cial and economic justice. 
Low-income and middle-class Ameri-
cans are encouraged to pursue higher 
education as a tool for economic and 
social mobility. But here is the catch, 
the enduring weight of student loan 
debt negates opportunities for many 
borrowers to truly transform their 
lives and our country. 
As the lead sponsor of the College for 
All Act in the House and a proud co-
sponsor of the debt cancelation bill 
from Representative OMAR, I know that 
eliminating student loan debt will bet-
ter ensure that earning a degree re-
mains a strong path to social mobility 
and economic security, particularly 
during this pivotal moment for our re-
covery. That is why the administration 
should cancel student loan debt. 
They can start with immediately 
eliminating at least $50,000 in student 
loan debt per borrower before the pay-
ments begin again. It is a single action 
that can cement progress for an entire 
generation of Americans and those who 
come after that. So let’s deliver that fi-
nancial breathing room. Let’s deliver 
on racial equity and economic security 
by canceling student loan debt. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL for her 
remarks, and I thank her for her con-
gressional leadership as the chair of 
the Congressional Progressive Caucus. 
I thank the gentlewoman for lending 
her voice and vision to this very impor-
tant issue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT), who represents the Boogie 
Down Bronx right next door to me. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Representative 
BOWMAN
for 
yielding. Don’t forget, I also represent 
Manhattan. I am a Latin from Manhat-
tan. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for giving me the opportunity 
to address this incredible issue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of canceling student debt for over 
43 million Americans. In fact, Madam 
Speaker, student debt for some time 
now has surpassed credit card debt for 
America. It is mind-boggling to con-
sider that for many Americans they 
could be indebted for a significant pe-
riod of their adult lifespan. Those who 
have children and then choose to help 
them out could be indebted for an en-
tire life. So this is not the way a coun-
try should move forward. 
For more than a decade, mounting 
student loan debt has made it difficult 
for many Americans to purchase a 
home, to start their own business, to 
move forward and aspire to be part of 
the middle class or the advancement 
that this Nation should promise all its 
people. 
They have difficulties saving for the 
future of their families, so this is a 
transgenerational crisis. It is far be-
yond one generation. 
Recent data shows that borrowers in 
the United States owe collectively $1.6 
trillion in Federal and private student 
loan debt. With the surge of the 
coronavirus cases and the rise in unem-
ployment claims, the student loan cri-
sis only worsened. It became a very 
deep crisis not only impacting Amer-
ican futures but putting in jeopardy 
the immediate needs and well-being of 
American families. 
As a strong proponent of student debt 
cancelation, I was proud to join my 
colleagues in responding to the grow-
ing crisis. Democrats in the House of 
Representatives led a bipartisan effort 
to provide economic assistance and re-
lief to student borrowers in the CARES 
Act which was extended in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. So we have a record, 
Madam Speaker, of trying to throw a 
lifeline to all these borrowers who are 
drowning in debt. 
Earlier this year I was proud to join 
my colleagues in calling for a bold plan 
to tackle the student loan debt crisis 
and cancel up to $50,000 in student loan 
debt for Federal student loan bor-
rowers. 
Failure to cancel student loan debt 
will continue to greatly affect the 
quality of life for millions of Ameri-
cans. Like the coronavirus pandemic, 
student debt disproportionately affects 
low-income, working class, and com-
munities of color. We must work to 
create a more equitable outcome for 
everyone. 
Student loan cancelation isn’t only 
relief for debt holders, it is also one of 
the most effective ways to stimulate 
our economy. Let’s be smart about 
this, Madam Speaker. Let’s be smart 
about this. Let’s unshackle and unsad-
dle people from their debt so they can 
have just a little bit more money in 
their pocket and spend it in local busi-
nesses. 
b 1900 
They will not run away on a Euro-
pean vacation. They will not go to the 
South of France. They will go to the 
local store and spend their money 
there on emergency items, milk, Pam-
pers, and food. So let’s help them out. 
When Americans aren’t burdened by 
student loans, they are more easily 
able to start businesses and help their 
families. Removing the financial bar-
riers allows Americans to more easily 
join the workforce, as well. 
So not only will it stimulate local 
businesses and small businesses, which 
continue to be the biggest employers in 
America, but it would also help people 
come back to the workforce. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus to provide relief and 
economic justice to the millions upon 
millions of struggling debt owners 
under a mountain of student debt. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my distin-
guished colleague from the Bronx, and 
from Mount Vernon, and from Rock-
land County, and all the other areas 
that the gentleman distinguishes and 
represents for yielding to me. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. ESPAILLAT
for his kind 
words. Before he goes, I want to under-
score what he said about people invest-
ing in their own communities when 
they have more money in their pock-
ets. The gentleman just made me think 
of all the young children who want to 
take art classes, drama classes, and 
swimming lessons, and receive tutor-
ing, and all the things that families 
cannot afford because they are trying 
to pay down their student debt. 
They can reinvest in their commu-
nities, reinvest in their children, and 
their children will be much less likely 
to commit harm to themselves or their 
communities because they have been 
developed and nurtured from an early 
age. 
I thank the gentleman so much for 
his remarks, my brother representing 
the Bronx, Manhattan, and the historic 
Washington Heights. We cannot forget 
that, Brother. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS), my sister and fellow freshman. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative BOW-
MAN for yielding. 
I am here today with the urgent re-
quest that the Biden administration 
cancel the student debt obligations 
that burden 44.7 million Americans. I 
am one of these 44.7 million Americans 
who is still paying off student loans 
well after our college days. 
I rise today to elevate the voices of 
the numerous constituents who con-
tinuously call me, Facebook me, and 
DM me to tell me their stories, includ-
ing Natalie from Morningside and 
Jacob from Atlanta, both of whom told 
me that they are desperate for relief 
and that they only see heartache in 
their futures, all thanks to their stu-
dent loan debt. 
But we know that it doesn’t have to 
be this way. During the COVID–19 pan-
demic, a financial lifeline was extended 
to the American people with emer-
gency student loan relief. But that life-
line is going to end in just 2 short 
months. 
Now that we have seen that being 
free of the burden of student loan debt 
is possible, we must deliver for the 
American people and cancel student 
debt permanently. 
Student debt is disproportionately 
held by Black borrowers and continues 
to worsen the racial wealth gap. No-
where is it more obvious to have this

vicious cycle of student loan debt exac-
erbate the racial wealth gap than with 
our historically Black colleges and uni-
versities. Not only am I a proud third- 
generation HBCU alum of Talladega 
College, but Georgia’s Fifth Congres-
sional District has more HBCUs than 
any other congressional district in this 
country. 
HBCUs have been intentionally un-
derfunded throughout their history. 
While the Build Back Better Act will 
partially rectify that injustice, HBCUs 
are still struggling to meet the needs 
of the more than 290,000 students en-
rolled in more than 100 HBCUs across 
America today. HBCUs’ endowments 
are smaller compared to those of pre-
dominantly White institutions, and, in 
turn, that limits the aid that HBCUs 
can provide to our students, leading to 
larger student loans and smaller alum-
ni donations, burdening grads with 
tens of thousands of dollars in debt and 
perpetuating the cycle for generations 
to come. 
Student loan debt also prevents peo-
ple from starting a family and building 
a better life. An Education Trust study 
found that of graduate degree holders 
who earn between $75,000 and $100,000 
with $94,000 in student loan debt, 55 
percent of debtors delayed investments 
in retirement; 67 percent postponed 
buying a home; and 36 percent post-
poned having a child. 
We live in the richest country in the 
world. We ought to be ashamed of these 
statistics. We shouldn’t accept that 
people must choose between paying off 
student loans or having the family that 
they have always dreamed of. For gen-
erations, 
American 
students 
have 
heard that a college education is the 
key to unlocking the American Dream. 
Instead of unlocking the American 
Dream, we have only created a unique-
ly American nightmare. 
We made a promise to the American 
people. We can deliver on that promise 
by canceling student loan debt so that 
everyone can thrive and not merely 
survive. 
I thank Representative BOWMAN for 
hosting this Special Order hour, and I 
look forward to making sure that we 
deliver on the promise of America for 
everyone. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman WILLIAMS
for 
participating. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ), who represents the Bronx and 
Queens. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. We are here, Bronx boogie 
down caucus checking in, yerr caucus 
checking in, student loan cancellation 
caucus checking in because this is get-
ting ridiculous. This is ridiculous. 
I am 32 years old. I am a first-genera-
tion college graduate on my mom’s 
side, and growing up, I was told, since 
I was a child: Your destiny is to go to 
college. That is what is going to lift 
our family up and out. That is our fu-
ture. That is what we are here to ac-
complish. 
I was 17 years old when college re-
cruiters started coming to my high 
school saying: This is worth it. 
We still do that today because it is 
teenagers signing up for what is often 
hundreds of thousands of dollars of 
debt, and we just do that, and our gov-
ernment allows that. We give 17-year- 
olds the ability to sign on and sign up 
for $100,000 worth of debt, and we think 
that is responsible policy. 
I am 32 years old now. I have over 
$17,000 in student loan debt. I didn’t go 
to graduate school because I knew that 
getting another degree would drown me 
in debt that I would never be able to 
surpass. This is unacceptable. 
Not only that, but 65 percent of all 
jobs in this country require an edu-
cation beyond high school; first-gen-
eration college students are two times 
as likely to report being behind on stu-
dent loan payments; and 63 percent of 
borrowers who made payments with 
Navient during the COVID forbearance 
still owe more now than they origi-
nally borrowed. There are hundreds of 
thousands of people in this country 
who owe more on their student loans 
now than they did when they first took 
them out. 
We as a country are profiting off of 
insurmountable 
and 
crushing 
edu-
cational debt, and it is wrong. It is ab-
solutely wrong. Four years after grad-
uation, 48 percent of Black students 
owe an average of 12.5 percent more 
than they originally borrowed. 
But this isn’t just an issue of a debt 
crisis. This is an educational crisis in 
the United States of America. If we 
want to remain competitive, if we want 
to remain innovative, and if we need 
the 
technological 
investments 
nec-
essary to address things like climate 
change, we need an educated country. 
The United States has a policy of ac-
tively 
disincentivizing 
higher 
edu-
cation. We disincentivize people from 
getting a college or secondary edu-
cation beyond high school. That is 
backward. The least we can do—we 
have a moral obligation, an economic 
obligation, a political obligation to 
cancel student loan debt in the United 
States of America. 
We have seen the benefits that this 
has had during the forbearance alone. 
It has given people the breathing room 
to do what they need to do so we can 
stop writing these ridiculous articles 
that young people are killing diamond 
rings, that they are not buying houses, 
and that they are killing this industry 
or that, that we are not having chil-
dren. It is because we are being crushed 
by immoral debt. 
No person should have to go into 
debt, crushing debt, in order to get an 
education. It is wrong. It is backward, 
and it doesn’t help us as a country. So 
I am greatly looking forward to that. I 
am greatly looking forward to the 
Biden administration canceling stu-
dent loan debt and no longer advancing 
the false narrative that student loan 
debt is for the privileged. 
What a ridiculous assertion. Do we 
really think that a billionaire’s child is 
taking student loans? Come on. Come 
on. If you are taking on student loan 
debt, it is because you are likely a 
working or middle-class person. 
So let’s get real. Let’s cancel it. It is 
in the interest of the people. It is in 
the interest of this country. It is in the 
interest of our future. 
I thank the distinguished Represent-
ative from the Bronx and Westchester, 
JAMAAL BOWMAN, for yielding. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman OCASIO-CORTEZ 
for taking me back to when I was 17, a 
senior in high school, trying to figure 
out what the heck I was going to do. I 
decided to go to college. We didn’t have 
any money, so they offer you all this 
free money and say: There you go. You 
could take out as much as you want, as 
much as you need. Just come to our 
school, and we will take care of you. 
Then what happens is, you take on 
all of this debt, and then you get out, 
and you are underpaid in terms of the 
employment you receive. Then the rent 
is too high, and the groceries are too 
high, and the childcare is too high. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. BOWMAN. I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. And health in-
surance is too high. 
Mr. BOWMAN. And health insurance 
is too high. It is unbelievable. 
We need to cancel student debt and 
end the predatory practices on our 
young people, completely end the prac-
tice. 
It is my honor to now yield to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BOWMAN for yield-
ing. There is nothing freshman about 
him. He has hit the ground running 
since he has been here, and he has been 
a leader and partner on many issues, 
including this issue of student debt. I 
thank the gentleman for his partner-
ship on our congressional resolution 
calling for President Biden to provide 
broad-based student debt cancellation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of more than 45 million people in 
America 
crushed 
by 
the 
growing 
weight of the $1.7 trillion student debt 
crisis. The grandmother—you heard me 
right, the grandmother—I have a 76- 
year-old constituent in the Massachu-
setts Seventh still paying student 
loans, all while on Social Security and 
a fixed income. 
I rise on behalf of the new parents 
struggling to manage the skyrocketing 
costs of childcare for which Massachu-
setts is the second highest in the coun-
try, $21,000 per child for center-based 
care; new parents struggling to manage 
the skyrocketing cost of childcare, 
rent, and their student loan payments; 
the teacher who fears losing their 
teaching license because they have 
gone into default and can’t come up 
with that monthly student loan pay-
ment, not even the minimum.

December 2, 2021 
The irony of it is that this is debt 
that they incurred in order to be an ed-
ucator, in order to be a nation builder, 
to pour into our children, the next gen-
eration. 
I rise on behalf of an entire genera-
tion of young people, young people I 
met with a couple of weeks ago who, 
when I asked them about their future, 
were despondent and expressed great 
hopelessness: Well, I don’t know that I 
am going to go to college because I 
don’t want to be in debt for the rest of 
my life, and I fear if there will even be 
a planet for me to grow up on. 
I rise today on behalf of a whole gen-
eration of young people grappling with 
that sense of foreboding and despair, a 
generation of young folk who have 
been forced to hold off on pursuing edu-
cation, 
starting 
higher 
education, 
starting a small business, purchasing a 
home because of record levels of stu-
dent loan debt. 
I rise on behalf of Black and Brown 
folk who, due to generations of precise 
and intentional what I would charac-
terize as policy violence, have been 
forced to take on higher rates of stu-
dent debt for just a chance at the same 
degree as our White peers. 
b 1915 
Madam Speaker, the student debt 
crisis is one that disproportionately 
impacts our Black community. For too 
long, the narrative has excluded us and 
the unique ways in which this debt is 
exacerbating racial and economic in-
equities, compounding our gender and 
racial wealth gap. We have to borrow 
at higher rates just for a shot at the 
same degree as our White peers. 
Black women, in particular, bear the 
largest burden, as they are forced to 
take on higher student debt loads, all 
while navigating a persisting wage gap 
that allows Black women to earn just 
61 cents to every dollar earned by a 
White man. These are systemic bar-
riers that make it significantly more 
challenging to repay this debt. 
There are some who have questioned 
if this is regressive in impact, to cancel 
student debt of $50,000. They have ques-
tioned the merit as to whether or not 
this is a racial justice issue. Well, ask 
the presidents of the historically Black 
colleges and universities who have been 
using ARPA funds to cancel student 
debt. Not regressive in impact. Impor-
tant, necessary, and long overdue. 
These are systemic barriers that 
have existed long before this pandemic 
and unjust pre-COVID status quo. 
In this moment, as we work to build 
back better and do so equitably, Presi-
dent Biden has an opportunity and a 
responsibility and the authority to ad-
dress the hurt and harm these commu-
nities are feeling by using his execu-
tive authority to cancel $50,000 in Fed-
eral student loan debt. 
Doing so is one of most effective 
ways he can provide sweeping relief to 
millions of families while helping to re-
duce the racial wealth gap to lay the 
groundwork for an equitable and just 
long-term recovery. 
This is a crisis created through pol-
icy decisions, and we have a responsi-
bility to address it head on. In this mo-
ment of ongoing crisis, our families 
need every bit of help that they can 
get. 
In just under 2 months, student debt 
payments are scheduled to resume for 
millions of families across this coun-
try. Families who have been struggling 
to make ends meet throughout this 
pandemic, through no fault of their 
own in this pandemic-induced reces-
sion, will have an additional bill to 
cover. 
I have parents in my district in their 
fifties still paying on their student 
loans and now helping their children 
pay for their student loans. This is an 
intergenerational crisis. 
This 
summer, 
we 
applauded 
the 
Biden administration for heeding the 
calls of many of us here tonight, heed-
ing the calls of this movement, the 
movement that elected him, when they 
extended the pause on student loan 
payments. We fought hard for that. 
This welcome action gave another 
layer of protection to the millions of 
borrowers facing a disastrous financial 
cliff. But our work here is unfinished. 
This isn’t a question as to whether or 
not he has the authority, because that 
authority has already been exercised. 
The same authority should be used to 
extend the payment pause. President 
Biden must now cancel at least $50,000 
in student debt to boost the economy 
and to close the racial wealth gap. 
In this moment of a so-called reck-
oning on racial injustice, the only re-
ceipts that matter are policies and 
budgets. 
The truth, Madam Speaker, is that 
this economic crisis is far from over. 
Families in the Seventh District of 
Massachusetts and all across the coun-
try are continuing to struggle to make 
ends meet. Failure to act would be un-
conscionable, so we must move with 
urgency. 
As we continue the work of building 
a just and equitable recovery from the 
current economic crisis, broad-based, 
across-the-board, and permanent stu-
dent debt cancellation must remain 
front and center. 
The people, including the broad and 
diverse coalition that elected President 
Biden, demand, deserve, and require 
nothing less. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman PRESSLEY
for 
her words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
so much Representative BOWMAN for 
hosting this critically important Spe-
cial Order hour tonight. 
Representative BOWMAN
said some-
thing that really resonated with me. 
When I was a senior in high school, 
they really did make it sound like that 
money was free. That money was far 
from free, as we know. 
Students in our country have become 
profit centers. They really, truly have, 
and it is ruining lives. 
One of the first ever townhalls I had 
when I first got elected was in western 
Wayne, in Wayne County, Michigan. 
A young lady, after I opened it up for 
questions, stood up. She stood up very 
strong and looked over at me and 
started crying, in tears, telling me just 
how incredibly hard it is to be able to 
survive, become a homeowner, to be 
able to move on. She told me about 
how much it felt like she was trapped, 
like she was hostage to the student 
loan debt, and the fact that all she 
wanted to do was give back. She want-
ed to get her degree and come back to 
the community that raised her, come 
back to the community and give back, 
and it was so incredibly hard. 
Today, as we hear over and over 
again, 15 million of our neighbors 
across our country owe trillions in out-
standing student debt. That alone 
should resonate with so many of my 
colleagues. This must become a na-
tional priority. 
One of the things that I think is im-
portant, as we hear about these stories, 
is the human impact. I was the first in 
my family to graduate from high 
school. My father only went up to a 4th 
grade education, my mother, an 8th 
grade education. My father came here 
at 19 years old. They could have never 
imagined, of course, their daughter 
being able to graduate from high 
school and go on to college. Yes, I 
worked full-time Monday through Fri-
day and took weekend classes to get 
my law degree and still had close to 
$200,000 in debt. I still owe over $70,000, 
and most of it is interest. Most of it 
was 
our 
own 
government 
making 
money and profit off of me. 
And guess what? I didn’t go to work 
for the for-profit entities. I went to 
legal aid. I worked at the nonprofit or-
ganization fighting for the right to 
breathe clean air, to fight for the work-
er that was getting their wage taken 
and stolen by their employer. I worked 
on immigrant rights and so much 
more. 
All of that is to say, we have to stop 
treating folks paying for their edu-
cation as if they bought some bougie 
car or something big, something be-
yond them. But, no, they were seeking 
an education. 
As many of my colleagues will tell 
you, there is that counselor in the hall-
way that would pull us aside and say, 
Rashida, where is your application for 
college? You have got to apply. And I 
am like, I am the eldest of 14, Coach 
Watson—it was Coach Perry Watson at 
Southwestern High School. He still re-
members pulling me into his office be-
cause he didn’t get an application from 
me—and I said, I am the eldest of 14; I 
can’t go—my parents are working-class 
folks; my dad worked on the line at 
Ford Motor Company—and say, Hey, 
dad, help me out here; I want to go to 
college. 
So all of that is to say, yeah, they sat 
us down. Of course, there was the Pell 
grant and all of that. Of course, there 
was. But at the end, it was still a

struggle. It was still a struggle. Be-
cause guess what, some of that money 
you couldn’t use for certain things. I 
remember this. They changed stuff a 
little bit after I graduated. But still, I 
had to work. I had to figure out how to 
pay for the gas to get to the school and 
so much more. 
But I think it is really important to 
know, in my home State of Michigan, I 
think the average loan borrower now is 
close to $35,000 in debt. You have to add 
on the healthcare costs, the rent, the 
utilities, car payments, and so much 
more to just really live your life. 
So the majority of our American peo-
ple, our neighbors right now, educated 
or not, live check by check. They lit-
erally live check by check. Add to that 
the average of $250 or more for student 
loans, it is really holding people back. 
When I look at my State—my dis-
trict is the third poorest congressional 
district in the country. When I look at 
the eyes and look at the families that 
I represent and they come to our town-
halls and talk about the struggles and 
‘‘please help, make government about 
people, make it about us, put us first.’’ 
One of the things that I continue to 
hear, the common theme is: We didn’t 
do anything wrong. We just went to go 
get access to higher education. They 
feel like they are being penalized. They 
feel, truly, that the interest rates—I 
read this—that the interest rates are 
one of the silent killers when it comes 
to debt repayment. They feel like they 
are being punished for doing something 
that they were taught to do, right? 
They go to college, do right, work 
hard, and they feel like they are being 
penalized. 
The cost of education in our country 
just continues to increase. We all know 
that. We see it over and over again. So 
what sounds like something that can’t 
be solved, that it is something impos-
sible, it actually is not that complex. 
President Biden has the ability, his 
administration has the ability, with 
the stroke of a pen, to help millions of 
our neighbors across the country to get 
out of student debt. 
We are far from putting this pan-
demic behind us. It has been a struggle 
for many of us. Yes, these payments 
are going to be coming due. Folks are 
so anxious about it, even planning now. 
Folks are sending me messages on so-
cial media, What do I do about Christ-
mas? Because I know around the cor-
ner, I have got to start repaying the 
student loans. 
It is difficult to put into words just 
how big of a difference relieving this 
heavy burden would make in the lives 
of so many of my residents. 
I am grateful to stand here with 
many of my colleagues joining in this 
fight. Rarely, if ever, in politics are 
you presented with an easy solution to 
such an impossible problem. But this 
one isn’t. This one is pretty easy. We 
are the ones. The government is prof-
iting off of people, and we have got to 
stop. 
I think when we, again, make govern-
ment about people and we put them 
first, then I think it is going to be an 
easy decision for the administration 
and for President Biden to come up 
with the plan that is needed to really 
help that young lady that came to my 
townhall, and so many others, in mak-
ing this a national priority. 
I can tell you, they all know, and 
they were all doing what they were 
supposed to be doing and at the end, 
they are still struggling. 
I know my colleague is not a million-
aire, but I always like reminding peo-
ple of this. The majority of my col-
leagues in this Chamber are. They 
don’t understand the struggle of living 
check by check. They don’t under-
stand. Some of them may not be close 
in understanding the pain of that stu-
dent loan debt that is really heavy on 
so many families. 
So I stand here in solidarity with my 
colleagues in saying, let’s do the right 
thing, let’s make this a national pri-
ority, let’s get an executive order done, 
and let’s help millions of Americans 
that did nothing wrong except wanting 
to access a higher education which, as 
they were told, was access to a beau-
tiful, vibrant life in our country. 
Again, we can’t continue to make 
them a profit center. We have to make 
them our priority, and they deserve to 
be able to live and thrive in our coun-
try. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman TLAIB so much 
for her powerful words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from New York 
for both his leadership and his inspira-
tion. He obviously cares. That is why 
he is on the floor tonight. 
I think that is the point that I want 
to make. It looks as if we are lonely on 
this floor tonight. It looks as if we are 
in the eve of the day’s work. It looks as 
if we could be somewhere else. 
I can tell you, being from a district 
in Houston that is surrounded by uni-
versities, and I know that I will get 
someone in trouble for trying to call 
the roll of the universities around the 
18th Congressional District, like the 
historic Texas Southern University, 
University of Houston, University of 
St. Thomas, Houston Baptist Univer-
sity, Lone Star College, Houston Com-
munity College, and San Jacinto Col-
lege. I know someone is texting me 
right now. But I am full of college stu-
dents, all of them working very hard. 
I thought I would bring to the floor 
today the Constitution. I love the 
words of the Declaration of Independ-
ence, the opening words, that we are 
all created equal with certain inalien-
able rights of life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. 
Does that mean the students that are 
right now struggling to make ends 
meet—I think of that famous noodle 
meal that they eat because they just 
don’t have the money to survive—does 
that mean that one person, that is still 
the first person to go to college, in 
2021, the single mother that has made 
it to 20-something hours, has to drop 
out? 
America has always said that the 
American Dream is defined singularly 
by your presence here in the United 
States. Yet, we are finding that State 
and Federal policymakers are ignoring 
the $1,730,000,000 plus of national stu-
dent debt and that one-sixth of the 
American people, 47,900,000, about that 
number, are indebted to student debt. 
That is why we are here on the floor 
today, recognizing that it also is an 
imbalance. 
b 1930 
I thank Mr. BOWMAN, an educator, 
who has seen little babies grow up with 
little stars in their eyes. They can play 
a piano or they can play an instrument 
or he sees them playing on the field of 
recreation, and they are little sci-
entists, scholars, but yet the hopes and 
dreams of the opportunity is somewhat 
denied. 
Black families must take on more 
debt for the same degree as White stu-
dents and often need to get several de-
grees in order to be in the middle class. 
The burden of student debt reaches 
deep into communities of color. In-
creasing evidence suggests that it is 
hampering the ability to build wealth. 
One of the reasons my good friend 
and myself are also interested in the 
idea of the commission to study slav-
ery and develop reparation proposals is 
to get a roadmap of some of the popu-
lations that are impacted negatively 
by student debt. 
Default and delinquency rates on stu-
dent loans remain appallingly high. 3.6 
million students are in the State of 
Texas. The Nation carries $1.7 trillion 
debt, and we know that 79 percent of 
Black students had student loan debt 
by their fourth year. We know it im-
pacts our Latinx families and families 
that come from rural communities. We 
are concerned about them. 
I hold in my hand the Constitution, 
as I said. I don’t know how many stu-
dents have time to even look in that 
direction, but I will tell them that the 
Founding Fathers, although not per-
fect, said that they came together to 
create a more perfect Union. 
And what does that mean? I think it 
means, give us hope, give us a lifeline, 
let us breathe, and let us be able to buy 
the things that will help our families. 
Let us not, as a Black male borrower, 
default on loans within 12 years of be-
ginning school. 
This, of course, covers the gamut of 
all of America. It is not just the issue 
of people of color. It impacts older bor-
rowers, 60 and older, whose numbers 
swelled from 700,000 in 2005 to 2.8 mil-
lion in 2018. Their debt load was $8.2 
billion. Can you imagine being 60 and 
older and still paying debt? 
I came here to the floor tonight be-
cause I have wanted to join the gen-
tleman for people to see that in spite of 
the fact that we are here at a moment

December 2, 2021 
into the evening, we care about getting 
this done. It must be the Congress and 
the administration that takes ahold of 
this and determines that people who 
are now struggling to pay mortgages, 
to survive, to feed children, we hope 
the Build Back Better bill will be a 
lifeline, but right now we have got to 
deal with people who wanted to do 
right and are suffering. 
I want to close on this note: To cre-
ate a more perfect Union, the Constitu-
tion guarantees me that. The Declara-
tion of Independence says that this Na-
tion was created to ensure the inalien-
able rights of life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. 
And I want to say to those who have 
gained student debt but never com-
pleted their degree, they are not in any 
way bad people, defaulters, deadbeats; 
no, they are not. The Constitution ap-
plies to all. But they are people who 
are working in jobs just to survive. 
They wanted to finish school, but they 
were so overloaded; maybe they had to 
leave to take care of a sick mother or 
a sick father or maybe they had to 
leave to take care of younger brothers 
and sisters. I know those stories. But 
maybe they are now back in school 
struggling to just try to get that de-
gree. 
Let’s give them hope. Let’s give them 
dignity. Let’s help them with that de-
fault and turn it into success. Let’s 
join in—Congressman, thank you—to 
cancel student loan debt. And we are 
not frivolous, big spenders. We are try-
ing to put people on the right track so 
that they can contribute to this great 
economy and be givers, givers for what 
is good in America. I hope we can get 
the job done. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Thank you so much, 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON
LEE. 
You 
made me think of the hundreds or even 
thousands of students and families that 
I have met throughout my career in 
education who in elementary school 
have already made the decision that 
their children are not going to attempt 
to go to college despite their brilliance, 
despite them being artists and sci-
entists and architects and engineers 
and athletes and musicians and all of 
those things. 
Because of the crippling impact of 
student debt and cost of college, they 
have already made the decision when 
kids are as young as 5, 6 years old. 
That is unconscionable, that is un- 
American, and the President has the 
authority and the moral responsibility 
to cancel student debt right now. 
Thank you so much for your words. 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GOMEZ), the last speaker of 
the evening. I thank him for being 
here. 
Mr. 
GOMEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Mr. BOWMAN for organizing this 
Special Order hour. 
I like to describe the student loan 
debt crisis as a boot on the neck of the 
American Dream and on the neck of 
millions of Americans who make that 
American Dream a reality. And that is 
because higher education is the one 
way that we achieve the American 
Dream. It is what I did. 
I am the youngest of six of immi-
grant parents from Mexico. My two 
parents never made it past third grade. 
Both could read but not really write. 
One of the things that they knew is 
that coming here would give me that 
opportunity to change my life. I was 
fortunate enough to be born here. My 
brother Javier and I were born here, 
and I was one of the first to graduate 
from college. 
It allowed me to believe that I could 
do more, to believe I could be part of 
this country, and about that American 
promise. You come here, you believe in 
our values, you work hard, you give 
back, you are going to have a place, 
and you are going to succeed; and the 
next generation, your kids and your 
grandkids, are going to do even better. 
I am fortunate. I got to go to a com-
munity college after I worked at Sub-
way and Target, and then I transferred 
to UCLA, graduated in the top 10 per-
cent of my class. Then I got my mas-
ter’s of public policy from Harvard Uni-
versity. 
I ended up walking away with $15,000 
in debt from undergrad, which wasn’t 
bad. I thought it was a lot of money. 
When you graduate, and you are only 
getting paid $24,000 a year, it was a lot 
of money. And I walked away with a 
little bit over $65,000 from the Kennedy 
School for my master’s degree. And 
don’t forget, a lot of students also have 
credit card debt on top of that. 
But you know what, I am fortunate 
that I got to go to school. I am fortu-
nate that I have been able to change 
my life. I am fortunate that I have 
been able to get jobs that provide me 
health insurance for the first time in 
my family’s history, and that my debt 
isn’t as crippling as the current genera-
tion’s debt. 
The current generation’s debt after 
the Great Recession ballooned to his-
toric proportions. That is why you 
have trillions of dollars in student loan 
debt on the backs of 47 million Ameri-
cans. 
You know what? These are dreamers; 
these are people who believe in the 
American Dream, that say, you know 
what, I have been told, go to school, 
work hard. And you know what, it 
doesn’t matter, if you get into the best 
school possible, take out that debt be-
cause it is going to come back tenfold. 
In the past, that was the case. 
But we don’t see that now. We see 
that the debt that has been put on the 
backs—because we underinvested in 
higher education, we underinvested in 
K–12—is crippling people to living their 
version of the American Dream. 
It is so severe, and it pains me and it 
depresses me, that people are actually 
are deciding, I would rather not go to 
college because I don’t want to have 
debt. Think about that. That is the de-
cision people are making now, I would 
rather not have the best opportunity to 
achieve the American Dream because 
the amount of debt will prevent me 
from living that American Dream once 
I graduate. 
I think that is shameful because 
these are the folks that are renewing 
this idea to live a more just and perfect 
Union, to refresh that idea generation 
upon generation. And it is unfortunate 
because who does it impact? It often 
impacts immigrants, people of color, 
Blacks, Latinos, single mothers, single 
parents. They are the ones that are 
taking on higher and higher burdens of 
debt. 
Then when they graduate, they some-
times get jobs that don’t pay them 
that well because they want to give 
back. They care about their commu-
nities. We saw in a recent New York 
Times article that graduates from a 
school of social work were graduating 
with $112,000 in debt but getting paid 
$50,000. This is something that we see 
time and time again. 
If people want to believe in the 
American Dream, then they have to 
care about canceling student loan debt; 
to refresh the potential of millions of 
Americans to buy their first house, to 
raise children, to start a business, to 
grow our economy. I believe that this 
is something that Americans from all 
sides of the aisle could agree on. 
Madam Speaker, I am calling on the 
President to cancel $50,000 of student 
loan debt in the next year. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman GOMEZ for his pow-
erful and inspiring words. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion have made some important strides 
to improve student loan debt for many 
people who are enrolled in public serv-
ice loan forgiveness. 30,000 people get-
ting loan forgiveness is a big step in 
the right direction. Now we need loan 
forgiveness for the more than 40 mil-
lion other people in this country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF 
FREE STUFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I am fas-
cinated to learn that I serve in the 
United States House of free stuff be-
cause that is what I have been hearing 
nonstop this entire week. 
There is an unlimited supply of 
money and resources apparently, an 
unlimited supply of dollars that we can 
continue to print while devastating our 
economy, devastating the American 
dollar, and transforming our society by 
encouraging Americans to believe that 
there is a free lunch. And there ain’t no 
free lunch. 
My wife is the product of a single 
mom growing up in Texas. Her mom 
worked multiple jobs to send her to 
college. She worked hard to be able to 
go to college. She left with 70-some-
thing thousand dollars of student loans

despite going to two top public univer-
sities in the State of Texas. 
She is not asking for her loans to get 
repaid because she went there with a 
free will. She went there and made a 
choice. She could have chosen a dif-
ferent path. She chose to take the debt. 
I did the same thing when I went to 
law school at the University of Texas. 
I might not have chosen to go to law 
school if the loans hadn’t been avail-
able, and that might be fine. 
What is the fundamental problem? 
Why has the cost of education sky-
rocketed in my lifetime at an inflation 
rate multiple times over virtually 
every other product and service in this 
country except for healthcare? Why is 
it up something like 3,000 percent? 
Is it perhaps because we are sub-
sidizing the holy heck out of it? Just 
thinking perhaps that there might be a 
correlation to the availability—mas-
sive, widespread availability—of sub-
sidized student loans, the massive sub-
sidization of K–12 education and higher 
ed. Do we think there might be a cor-
relation to why the costs have sky-
rocketed so much? 
But no, no, no, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle now walk in here 
and say, oh, you know, we are not the 
party of big spenders; we have got a 
chart here with $1.7 trillion on it with 
another chart saying, ‘‘Cancel Student 
Debt.’’ 
Who is paying for that? Does anybody 
in this body give a rat’s rear end about 
who is paying for anything at all? No. 
Oh, no, then they will come out here 
and say $3 trillion of tax cuts. They 
don’t care about economic growth and 
opportunity. But fine. 
Why don’t we actually have a con-
versation about spending and taxes? 
No, no, we don’t do that. We just spend 
money we don’t have. That is what we 
did today in the continuing resolution 
to keep this government running. Oh, 
my gosh, panic ensues if you dare ques-
tion whether or not the government 
must be funded Saturday at 12:01 in the 
morning. What will the American peo-
ple do? How will they function if the 
United States House of free stuff isn’t 
doling out free stuff? 
b 1945 
No one is in this Chamber, of course. 
Just reminding the American people 
how this place doesn’t work. We are 
now on 51⁄2 straight years of no amend-
ments being offered on the floor of this 
august Chamber. 
I would like to remind the American 
people every once in a while that what 
they saw about how a bill becomes a 
law is a complete fraud. See, there is a 
handful of people who get into a room 
and they decide what you are going to 
vote on. 
The Speaker knows it is true, and my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
know it is true. And my colleagues on 
this side of the aisle know it is true be-
cause they did it when they were in the 
majority just as much as my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
did it when they were in the majority. 
We get a massive bill dropped on our 
desk, and we say take it or leave it. Go 
offer an amendment in rules, they say. 
Never taken. Never accepted. Always 
prechosen, always pregamed out. 
This is deliberation and debate? This 
is the constitutional order? What value 
is there for an election certificate if 
you can’t use it? You come to the floor 
and want to offer an amendment in 
good faith to try to make a piece of 
legislation better, and you can’t do it. 
We have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 people max 
who decide everything that goes on in 
this Chamber in all of their infinite 
wisdom. Then we come down and look 
at the board, and it is party-line votes, 
and then it is walk out on the steps and 
go give a speech and go to the press 
and go on Twitter and go on Facebook 
and go talk about why you are voting 
no or yes. That is what we are rel-
egated to in the United States House of 
free stuff. 
But today, we just voted to extend 
the funding of government with a con-
tinuing resolution, which is going to 
barrel us toward a trillion-dollar def-
icit this year, give or take. Who 
knows? Does it matter? Does anybody 
know what the difference is between a 
trillion dollars or $1.2 trillion? Does 
anybody know the difference between 
$29 trillion in debt or $30 trillion in 
debt? Nobody knows or cares in this 
Chamber. Literally not a lick. We don’t 
talk about it. 
Then each side comes down on the 
floor and offers more spending for 
whatever their priority is, defense, 
nondefense, mandatory spending, non-
mandatory spending. 
If 
the 
unbelievably 
terrible 
cir-
cumstance occurred Friday night at 
midnight of this government daring to 
pause, do the American people know 
that about 82 percent of it is on auto-
pilot 
with 
mandatory 
spending? 
I 
mean, does that matter? When you 
walk out and a gaggle of reporters 
come up with bated breath, oh, no, 
there might be a government shut-
down. It always gets paid back. Eighty- 
two percent of it keeps running. 
There is never a serious debate about 
what is actually happening here in the 
United States of America. We never ac-
tually sit down like family or a small 
business, roll our sleeves up, and decide 
how to spend money. Do you imagine if 
we actually had to adhere to a budget 
like any business or American family, 
and we actually had to sit down, 
Madam Speaker, at that table and not 
leave this Chamber until we said our 
budget is $3 trillion or $4 trillion, what-
ever it is, here is our income; here is 
what we can spend; that is all we can 
do; let’s figure out our priorities. Well, 
we disagree. You know, do you want to 
fund NEA? Do you want to fund the De-
partment of Education, XYZ? Do you 
want to fund the military? Do you 
want to fund specific B–52 bombers? Do 
you want to fund healthcare? Do you 
want to fund border security? 
Make a choice. We never make a 
choice, ever—both parties, by the way, 
both leaders. We never make a choice. 
All we do is preen and posture and 
come down here with massive bills that 
have some of our priorities, depending 
on who is in the majority. That is it. 
Again, we are relegated to being the 
United States House of free stuff. 
You have to call it free stuff because 
we are just printing the money to do 
the stuff. We are down here talking 
about, oh, we have to cancel the stu-
dent debt. Well, man, wouldn’t that be 
lovely? Who cares about the people who 
have already worked hard their whole 
lives to pay off their student loans, 
whether they be Black, Brown, White, 
male, female. Who cares? 
They have worked their whole life. 
They paid off their student loans. They 
did what they were supposed to do, or 
they are in the middle of paying off 
their student loans. Oh, no, let’s just 
go down here. One of my colleagues 
just said $50,000, President Biden. Did 
they just pick that number out of the 
air? $50,000 of free stuff, here you go. 
Somebody else chose not to go to col-
lege. Somebody else started a business, 
worked hard, borrowed money to run a 
business. Guess what? That money also 
had interest, to my colleague from 
Michigan who was down here talking 
about, oh, the pain of interest. As if it 
is not as old as time, as if it is not Bib-
lical to say: Hey, I don’t have the 
money to do something. I would like to 
have the money to do something. How 
might I get the money to do some-
thing? I don’t know. One, get a job and 
earn the money, save the money. Two, 
ask for it from somebody who loves 
you. Three, borrow it. 
Okay, now what do you do with that? 
Go do something with it. Make a 
choice. Start a business. Start a lem-
onade stand. Go to college if you want. 
But, oh, no, let’s just go pay off $1.7 
trillion of debt. It doesn’t matter if you 
went to school and got a degree in soci-
ology or gender studies and you are 
floating around and trying to figure 
out what you are going to do with your 
life. Oh, no, let’s pay off that $140,000. 
There ain’t no free lunch. But we live 
in this fiction that we can just keep 
printing money, and the horrors of 
printing the money is not just that we 
have $30 trillion in debt; it is not just 
that we have rampant inflation; it is 
not just that we are undermining our 
dollar; it is not just that we are hand-
ing over power to China and every 
other country around the world to kick 
our rear ends; it is that we are funding 
a government to do things to us to 
interfere with us. 
We are funding an FBI to target par-
ents for daring to question the wisdom 
of school boards around this country. 
People say: Oh, that is not true. You 
must be embellishing. 
It is not true? We just had hearings 
with the Attorney General of the 
United States. We just saw memoranda 
making it very clear that the FBI is 
targeting parents. We are funding that. 
For all Americans out there watch-
ing this, all 12 of you, we are funding

that. We are borrowing dollars, spend-
ing money we don’t have, and we are 
taking those dollars, and we are fund-
ing an FBI to target parents. 
We are taking away dollars from po-
lice departments, and Federal dollars 
are going in and funding programs al-
legedly to take the place of police and 
then wondering why department stores 
are getting looted. 
Then you have the White House press 
secretary today literally at the podium 
saying that is the fault of the pan-
demic, all the looting. We are not talk-
ing about somebody breaking into a 
grocery store to buy a loaf of bread. We 
are talking about people swarming a 
department store and taking Gucci 
bags. 
Oh, no, let’s not enforce the law. 
Let’s not enforce the rule of law. Let’s 
blame it on the pandemic. Let’s blame 
Border Patrol for whipping migrants, 
which was demonstrably and totally 
and clearly false. 
There is no shame coming from the 
Press Secretary’s Office of the White 
House. No lie that won’t easily slip out 
about what is actually going on, like 
Border Patrol agents whipping mi-
grants. No apology. All of those Border 
Patrol agents down there on the front 
lines dealing with COVID, dealing with 
being outmanned and outgunned, deal-
ing with cartels, no apology. 
Here we sit in the United States 
House of free stuff funding the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security not to se-
cure the homeland; funding the Depart-
ment of Education not to educate our 
kids, other than to indoctrinate them 
to hate our country and to believe they 
are racist for the color of their skin; 
$700 billion for a Department of De-
fense to now run climate training and 
to focus on chief diversity officers in 
the Department of Defense rather than 
focusing on, I don’t know, blowing stuff 
up and killing people, which is what 
the Department of Defense, formerly 
known as the Department of War, is ac-
tually supposed to do; $11 billion for an 
Internal Revenue Service that took a 
record $4 trillion from Americans last 
fiscal year; $9 billion for an EPA that 
is destroying American energy through 
regulation, pushing a radical climate 
agenda. None of which, by the way, is 
actually going to drive down CO2 pro-
duction, which we have been doing 
with clean-burning American natural 
gas over the last decade. 
Today, we pass this continuing reso-
lution in the United States House of 
free stuff to rack up another trillion 
dollars of debt, continuing to fund 
agencies to carry out their tyrannical 
activities, in particular to carry out 
vaccine mandates on the American 
people that are getting slapped down 
one by one by courts across this coun-
try because, of course, the President of 
the United States doesn’t have the au-
thority or the power to mandate that 
an American citizen go into a doctor’s 
office and get a needle jabbed in their 
arm. He doesn’t have that power. 
The United States House of free stuff 
here allegedly representing the people 
is supposed to actually care enough 
about representing those people to 
stand here as a board holding the line 
against an authoritarian President of 
the United States, against a President 
carrying out executive overreach. That 
is what we see happening. He is being 
slapped down left and right by the 
courts. 
Now, I don’t believe in wearing a par-
tisan hat when we are talking about 
standing 
up 
for 
the 
Constitution, 
standing up for the Article I branch of 
the Federal Government. I introduced 
legislation when the previous Presi-
dent, a Republican, President Trump, 
was in office called the Article I Act to 
take away powers from the President 
with respect to emergency powers 
being used. I did so, frankly, in the 
wake of the use of dollars for border 
fencing and wall construction, which I 
supported, which was important, which 
was a response to an emergency and, 
by the way, was working. But it was 
important for us to start laying out a 
foundation for protecting Article I, the 
United States Congress. 
Today we pass a continuing resolu-
tion that we sent over to the United 
States Senate, and we never had a vote 
in this body about the vaccine man-
dates that are being slapped down in 
courts across this country for being un-
lawful, 
unconstitutional, 
tyrannical 
overreach by the executive branch of 
the United States. 
Never in our history have we had 
Federal mandates applying across the 
country to the American citizens that 
they must be vaccinated. They have 
been local decisions, local schools, 
local counties in States and specific re-
sponses to highly communicable dis-
eases that they knew might be commu-
nicable and be pulled back by a vac-
cine, and after many years of study 
with massive numbers of exemptions 
and protections for individual liberty 
and choice. That is the history of how 
we have handled it in a federalist 50– 
State republic, not a decision by a 
President or, frankly, probably more 
likely the President’s advisers, that 
the American people must be vac-
cinated, that a small business or a 
business of any size must vaccinate 
their employees. 
People act like, well, it is no big deal. 
I ought to direct my remarks here to 
my Republican colleagues, my Repub-
lican colleagues who today were per-
fectly happy to vote no on this CR. 
Yes, I will go home, and I will give a 
speech: I voted no on this CR. I voted 
no because this continuing resolution 
had these terrible provisions in it. And, 
yes, this continuing resolution had 
vaccine mandate funding, funding the 
Department 
of 
Labor 
and 
funding 
OSHA and funding the Department of 
Defense to carry out these mandates. I 
voted no, don’t you know. 
So what? Who cares if you voted no? 
You vote no, and you give a speech, pat 
yourself on the back. Good for you. Did 
you do anything, go stand with any of 
the Senators who had a chance to actu-
ally do something with this, with the 
Senators over there right now having a 
debate and trying to force a vote on an 
amendment to prevent the tyrannical 
application of vaccine mandates? 
Did my colleagues say let’s go round 
up and go over and stand alongside 
MIKE LEE, or did they hide behind the 
Article III judiciary? Did they hide be-
hind the courts and say, well, let’s let 
the courts sort it out. No, that is ex-
actly what they did. Secure the bless-
ings of liberty in the Constitution in-
deed by the supposed primary branch of 
government. 
b 2000 
And these have real consequences for 
real Americans, real lives. Hospitals in 
Massachusetts are already limiting 
elective procedures due to critical 
staffing shortages. Do we care? Are we 
concerned about that? 
The New York Governor issued an ex-
ecutive order that postponed elective 
surgeries in order to deal with the 
staffing shortages. Do we care? Are we 
concerned? 
The largest children’s hospital in 
Wisconsin is struggling to treat vic-
tims 
of 
the 
BLM 
extremist, 
who 
rammed his car through the Waukesha 
Christmas parade. Do we care? 
A dear friend of mind suffering from 
multiple sclerosis, teaching at the uni-
versity, she is being told she may not 
be able to continue teaching because 
she believes, in consultation with her 
doctor, that it is in her best interest 
not to be vaccinated at this time. She 
should have the right and the ability to 
choose to do that for her and her fam-
ily and her interest without coercion 
from an overextended Federal Govern-
ment under an unlawful and unconsti-
tutional mandate by the President of 
the United States. 
And this body, the Congress of the 
United States, should do its Article I 
job and stand up in defense of her and 
every other American who is facing 
losing their job at Thanksgiving and 
Christmas, or being discharged from 
the military of the United States that 
they proudly served because they be-
lieve in their interest, in their own per-
sonal safety, their own health interest, 
that they should be the one to choose, 
not a faraway President. 
We structured this government spe-
cifically not to do this. We structured 
this government with Federalism and 
separation of powers specifically to 
avoid having a king. That man on the 
painting over on this wall, in this 
House Chamber, the first President of 
the United States, turned down being a 
king, 
turned 
down 
the 
monarchy, 
turned down a third term because the 
Founders knew why that mattered. The 
Founders knew why separating powers 
and limiting powers mattered because 
they saw and foresaw exactly what we 
are seeing today in this country and 
across the world. Where, in Austria and 
Germany and Australia and places 
around the world, we see mandates 
forcing people to be in their homes and

December 2, 2021 
not go out and not engage in society 
because they are not vaccinated. It is 
absurd. 
This country is built on a bedrock of 
liberty and protecting liberty and se-
curing the blessings of liberty, and this 
President is stepping on it. And the 
United States Congress, Members of 
both parties, are MIA, missing in ac-
tion, unwilling to stand up in defense 
of liberty while patting themselves on 
the back for voting ‘‘no’’ on a con-
tinuing resolution and then kicking it 
over to the Senate for one man to 
stand on the floor of the United States 
Senate, Senator MIKE LEE, daring to 
say we should have a vote on an 
amendment, an amendment that says 
we shouldn’t have this vaccine man-
date. God bless MIKE LEE for doing 
that. I hope he holds to his guns. 
And no, I am not going to freak out 
or panic if Saturday at 12:05 in the 
morning rolls around and, Oh, no, we 
haven’t gotten that funding done. That 
funding, by the way, that is racking up, 
as I said before, another trillion dollars 
of debt. The United States House of 
free stuff. 
A father called me up in tears be-
cause his 13-year Army veteran son is 
likely going to be discharged because 
he believes, based on his conversation 
with his doctors, that it is not in his 
interest to get the vaccination. Mil-
lions of Americans who know they 
have natural immunity, who have been 
ignored, who have been absolutely ig-
nored because the leaders of our na-
tional health organizations and agen-
cies aren’t actually focusing on natural 
immunity. We haven’t had a study on 
natural immunity of any consequence 
out of our leaders. We have got to rely 
on Israel and the U.K. and other places, 
and private entities. But all of these 
millions of Americans who have nat-
ural immunity are being told, Sorry, 
you must still go get a needle stuck in 
your arm in order to have a job. 
In what world is this the land of the 
free? It is not. And in what world are 
the people in this Chamber who are 
supposed to represent the people of the 
United States, how are they doing 
their job in the Article I branch of our 
Federal Government if they are not 
standing up for these people? 
Those people who are going about 
their lives, making decisions in our in-
terests—and by the way, as if this mat-
ters to me a whole lot—that even the 
experts, so-called, heading up our na-
tional health agencies and organiza-
tions, acknowledge that if you are vac-
cinated you still spread the daggone 
virus. It literally makes no sense. 
We are killing people. We are re-
straining and restricting therapeutics 
that can actually help people. We belit-
tle people who are working in consulta-
tion with doctors to find ways to solve 
the problem if they happen to get the 
virus—whether they have been vac-
cinated or not, by the way. And we are 
mandating people to get the vaccina-
tion, irrespective of whether they had 
the virus and have natural immunity. 
For months, I have been hearing 
about, Oh, they laugh off natural im-
munity. And now suddenly, you start 
to hear—bow down to the altar of all 
things—Dr. Fauci, that he suddenly 
said, Oh, yeah, natural immunity, that 
is kind of a real thing. No kidding. 
What world do you live in? The world 
of Washingtonian magazine and prop-
ping your feet up with sunglasses and 
getting cool pictures and throwing 
baseballs out at games? 
I had a young woman who is 9 
months pregnant. Remember all the 
frontline workers everybody was cele-
brating a year ago? She is one of them; 
she is a nurse. I saw all these people 
standing up at games, people in this 
Chamber going around praising the 
frontline 
workers. 
Well, 
good, 
we 
should have been praising the frontline 
workers who are out there, in an un-
known virus, showing up and helping 
those who were sick. But suddenly 
now, if you are one of those frontline 
workers, and for your own health and 
well-being, you decide you don’t be-
lieve you should be vaccinated, you 
might have natural immunity, maybe 
you have got an underlying condition 
and you choose not to. Then this young 
lady, a Texan, who is 9 months preg-
nant, is losing her job in direct re-
sponse to the President’s unlawful and 
unconstitutional mandates. 
Let’s talk about those mandates for a 
minute. 
The OSHA mandate. When the Presi-
dent goes in and tells businesses across 
this country, You must get your em-
ployees 
vaccinated 
or 
go 
through 
OSHA rulings and fines. This body just 
voted to increase the OSHA fines, 
something like 700 percent or 900 per-
cent. We just did that when we passed 
the so-called BBB bill that is going to 
destroy America with a whole bunch of 
more free stuff, $2 trillion of unpaid 
nonsense. 
Oh, no, don’t worry. It’s paid for. 
CBO said so. Garbage. Absolute, pure 
garbage. Of course, it is not paid for. It 
was games. The American people know 
all this. It is how this body works. No-
body here is serious about actually op-
erating within the bounds of normalcy, 
like you would in a business or in your 
home, because they don’t care. There is 
no consequence. There is literally no 
consequence to spending money we 
don’t have, to printing money. But 
that is what we do. 
So we just voted to increase fines by 
OSHA. Now with those fines OSHA can 
go target businesses. 
Well, what happened? Now, that has 
been consolidated. U.S. District judge 
for the Eastern District of Missouri 
granted a preliminary injunction on 
November 29 for 10 States who brought 
forth a November 10 lawsuit by State 
AGs. 
On December 1, in a similar ruling, 
Louisiana Western District U.S. Judge 
Terry Doughty issued a nationwide in-
junction to the CMS mandate, a sepa-
rate mandate, a CMS mandate—sorry, I 
mixed these up. 
The OSHA mandate, a panel of judges 
with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals 
issued an order staying enforcement 
and implementation of the OSHA man-
date. 
Now, back to the CMS mandate. Matt 
Schelp, the U.S. District judge for the 
Eastern District of Missouri, granted a 
preliminary injunction for 10 States. 
And on December 1, in a similar ruling, 
there is a nationwide injunction on the 
CMS mandates. So these are the man-
dates that are shutting down hospitals 
and nurses and doctors from carrying 
out their job. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle don’t care. And I know they 
don’t care because they just passed a 
continuing resolution continuing to 
fund the mandates of a tyrannical ex-
ecutive branch without holding him ac-
countable. 
b 2010 
I promise you if that were a Repub-
lican President they would be outraged 
at these mandates. My colleagues on 
this side of the aisle think voting ‘‘no’’ 
and walking out to go to dinner is per-
fectly fine because that is what is 
going on here. They are not over in the 
Senate backing up MIKE LEE or here 
talking. 
Federal workers mandate, Federal 
contractors mandate—on November 30, 
U.S. 
District 
Judge 
Gregory 
Van 
Tatenhove of the Eastern District of 
Kentucky issued a preliminary injunc-
tion halting the government’s enforce-
ment of the Federal contractor vaccine 
mandate, which, by the way, is man-
dating universities, which is causing 
my friend with MS to possibly or prob-
ably lose her teaching job. 
Veterans, 
Active 
Duty 
military, 
frontline health workers, university 
teachers, professors, visiting profes-
sors, people across this country in pri-
vate business—hopefully, the courts 
will strike this down. Since when is it 
the job of the Article I Congress to 
punt to the courts, and say, Well, I 
hope you do it. 
Do we care about the power of the 
purse? 
Do we care if bureaucrats are tar-
geting American citizens, saying, You 
must get a needle in your arm? 
There is no science indicating in any 
way, shape, or form that those man-
dates are solving any problem at all, 
but rather causing problems. Over 80 
percent of Americans over the age of 12 
years old have gotten one shot of the 
vaccine; 99 percent or something close 
to it are people over 65. 
We are not even a year into the broad 
rollout of the vaccines. This blows way 
past the polio epidemic. My dad had 
polio. I am well-versed in the impacts 
of the polio epidemic. It didn’t roll out 
nearly this fast. It was targeted at 
kids, not people over 65. 
Any mandates were left to school dis-
tricts, and it took them awhile to get 
there. This was a vaccine that had been 
worked on for years with a significant 
amount of knowledge. It was a dif-
ferent kind of virus, by the way, not a 
coronavirus.

H6905 
December 2, 2021 
A 21-year-old nursing assistant in 
Crawfordsville, 
Indiana, worked 60- 
hour weeks throughout the pandemic; 
she is facing termination. Do we care? 
Does the Indiana delegation care? Ei-
ther side of the aisle? I would like to 
know. 
Is the Indiana delegation over along-
side MIKE LEE fighting to prevent the 
funding of the government bureaucrats 
that are going to enforce that mandate 
on Becca Pitts? 
Jen Peters, a 39-year-old San Diego 
maternity nurse was forced to resign 
from her position after not getting vac-
cinated. 
I recently met with heart surgeons 
that fly around the country saving 
lives doing heart surgeries. They come 
in and they do that. They do pro bono 
work. They do a lot of volunteer work. 
They fly all over the world. They have 
been providers for, roughly, three dec-
ades, and if the CMS mandates stay in 
place, they are no longer going to be 
able to save lives, they will have to 
shut down. Are we fine with that? Is 
that okay? 
Dozens of my constituents in the 
military have contacted me about this 
vaccine mandate. I represent thou-
sands—like many of us do—but I rep-
resent San Antonio, a heavy popu-
lation of veterans and Active Duty 
military. People call me in tears be-
cause it was their dream to serve their 
country and wear the uniform of the 
United States, and they are being told 
they must get the jab, or they will be 
discharged. 
I am not talking about the ability of 
a commander of a submarine going out 
for a 9-month tour, and saying, Okay. 
Sorry. I am going to make sure every-
body in the submarine is vaccinated. 
Okay. Do you have to discharge the 
guy or gal? Or you can say, You know 
what, we are going to relocate you and 
leave you able to serve. But while this 
virus is going around, we are going to 
require the commander of the sub-
marine to be able to make that deci-
sion. Okay. That is a reasonable out-
come. 
Discharging under current law dis-
honorably, by the way, members of the 
United States military for not wanting 
to get the vaccine, for whatever reason 
they believe is in their interest, with 
young men in particular having con-
cerns about the myocarditis and the 
heart issues, and we are going to say, 
Sorry, too bad, you get discharged. 
This body just funded the DOD, and 
the government is forcing those people 
to be discharged, instead of continuing 
to carry out their service to this coun-
try, and this body should be ashamed 
of it. 
A lot of people in this town seem to 
have forgotten that the American peo-
ple are not our subjects. They are our 
fellow citizens, and we owe them the 
duty of representing them. They are 
our 
neighbors, 
our 
relatives, 
our 
friends. The people are sovereign in 
this country, not the President. 
George 
Washington 
turned 
that 
down, 
the 
Founders 
rejected 
that 
structure, and yet this body, which was 
supposed to be a check against an over-
bearing executive acting as a monarch 
refuses to check the executive. 
The CDC estimates that there have 
been 146 million infections, suggesting 
that nearly half of the United States 
has natural immunity. 
The first U.S. omicron patient was 
fully vaccinated and had mild symp-
toms. One study found the protective 
effect of the vaccine dwindles alarm-
ingly at 3 months after the second 
shot, hence, the boosters. People are 
now saying that maybe we made a mis-
take, having the first two shots of the 
vaccine happen right next to each 
other reduced the effectiveness. Well, 
lo and behold, hard to believe when you 
are rushing and reacting to a virus that 
you might make an error. 
Financial institutions today are put-
ting out reports saying their concern 
isn’t about the omicron variant but 
rather governments’ reaction to it. Of 
course, it is. One of the first doctors 
who discovered the variant in South 
Africa said, ‘‘Most of the patients are 
seeing very, very mild symptoms. We 
have been able to treat these patients 
conservatively at home.’’ 
On the 626th day into 15 days to slow 
the spread, we have had enough. The 
American people have had enough of 
being lied to and told what to do by a 
tyrannical Federal Government and so- 
called experts that we cannot and 
should not trust. 
This continuing resolution that we 
passed today was considered under a 
closed rule. As I said earlier, no chance 
for amending it. I offered an amend-
ment upstairs—rejected. We don’t want 
to have a debate on vaccine mandates. 
Why would we want to do that? 
My colleagues, I assume, would not 
like to take a vote on a vaccine man-
date funding repeal. Otherwise, why 
not have the vote? Why not have the 
debate? The more and more that we 
turn over the decisionmaking to a 
small group of people in this body and 
a small group of people in the Senate 
and a couple of people at the other end 
of Pennsylvania Avenue, the more and 
more this Republic is getting ripped 
apart thread by thread. It is happening 
no matter who is in the White House 
and no matter who is in charge of this 
body. 
b 2020 
If we do not restore debate on the 
floor of this body and in the Senate— 
the greatest deliberative body in the 
world. Come on. 
When was the last time you saw any 
great debate or deliberation in that 
body or this one, Madam Speaker? 
You don’t. We all know it. Nobody 
cares because all we are going to do is 
drop another 2,000-page bill, somebody 
is going to offer a motion to recommit. 
Boy, that will light things on fire. Oh, 
the previous question. Oh, man, the 
bars around town are talking about 
you. 
Did you see that previous question? 
Did you see that MTR? 
When are we going to represent the 
people again? 
When is this institution going to ac-
tually stand up and do the hard part of 
representation? 
We don’t govern. We use that term a 
lot. We don’t govern. We represent. 
That is what we are supposed to do in 
a republic. 
Next week we are going to turn to 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, and if the Senate doesn’t make 
any additional modifications, we are 
going to have another version of the 
NDAA, the National Defense Author-
ization Act, sent over to this Chamber 
for us to vote on again. In that legisla-
tion there are a number of problematic 
provisions. There is no accountability 
for the failed exit from Afghanistan, 
the 13 marines who died, the failed 
drone strike that led to the killing of 
10 people including seven children. No 
accountability. 
There is no accountability for the $85 
billion of assets left behind in Afghani-
stan that were just being used in a pa-
rade by our enemies, by the Taliban. 
No accountability. 
Madam Speaker, you have legislation 
that requires the Secretary of Defense 
to submit to Congress their plan to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions and 
praises the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change. Well, praise the 
Lord. Our Department of Defense is fo-
cused on the really important stuff as 
China is doubling and tripling and 
quadrupling their navy, ramping up 
their military prowess, and shooting 
missiles around the Earth at low orbit 
hitting their targets. Yes. Let’s focus 
on diversity. Yes. That will get them. 
That NDAA requires the DOD to hire 
and train gender advisers. Boy, that 
will send the Chinese packing. 
Yes, the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act will for the first time in the 
history 
of 
this 
country 
require 
women—girls—18 years and older to 
register for Selective Service, to reg-
ister to be eligible for the draft. 
My daughter is 10 years old. The infi-
nite wisdom of this body is going to re-
quire that my daughter be forced to 
register for the draft. If we want to 
have a debate about ending the draft, I 
am happy to do it. Let’s offer the bill, 
let’s have a debate and decide if we 
need to draft. I think most people in 
this body would probably vote the draft 
down. But that is not what we are 
going to do because my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle and, frankly, 
the retreat by my colleagues on my 
side of the aisle from such touchy 
issues, they want to make a statement. 
They want to make a statement about 
so-called equity, and they want to use 
my daughter to make that statement. 
They want to make your daughter, 
America, part of that statement. 
If you are one of the thousands of 
people across this country who have 
been reaching out to my office enraged 
because this body with no debate, no 
amendment, and no vote on the sub-
stance is going to adopt the National

Defense Authorization Act that for the 
first time in history will require your 
daughter, your sister, your mom, and 
your wife to register for the draft. 
Well, don’t worry, I am going to keep 
fighting it. 
I am not going to retreat, and I am 
not going to run away from some poll-
ster coming in saying, Well, I don’t 
know. I am not sure how people feel 
about it. 
I know how people feel about it. I 
know how they feel about it in my dis-
trict. I know how they feel about it in 
my kids’ school, in my communities. I 
know the people who have stop me in 
the airport saying thank you for stand-
ing up for some sort of common sense 
about how we should actually function 
as a society. 
Speaking of the United States House 
of free stuff, we spent $36 million for a 
study to determine whether single-sex 
units performed better or worse than 
mixed-sex units. 
What do you think they found? 
Madam Speaker, you will be blown 
away by this piece of information. The 
single-sex male units performed better. 
Oh, we don’t want to have that talk. 
My colleagues don’t want to have that 
debate. But I am going to keep having 
that debate. 
Whatever they do at the NDAA, if the 
Senate doesn’t have the backbone, if 
my 
Republican 
colleagues 
in 
the 
United States Senate won’t stand up 
for my daughter—our daughters—I will 
keep calling them out, every single one 
of them. I will call on every one of my 
colleagues in this body, and I sure as 
heck will not ever vote for a single one 
of them for any office if they are going 
to make my daughter eligible for the 
draft. 
This is not the way we should do 
things. 
Have a debate, offer data, have 
amendments, have the courage to have 
straight up-or-down votes on subjects 
rather than mega bills cooked up in 
back rooms so people can go preen and 
posture in front of cameras outside on 
the steps. 
No matter who is in charge of this 
body, restore this body, and don’t con-
tinue to operate as the United States 
House of free stuff doling out dollar 
after dollar and printing money to cre-
ate programs that we can’t even afford 
and to fundamentally alter and trans-
form this society into one that is ex-
pected from government rather than 
serving themselves, their fellow man, 
and their communities. 
We are destroying the core of this 
great country by empowering govern-
ment and doing so knowing full well we 
don’t have the dollars or the resources 
to do it; knowing full well that we are 
ripping out the soul of people by taking 
away the value of work; and destroying 
family units; destroying the public 
education system, by turning them 
into political corruption entities. The 
veil having been lifted now after 
COVID has exposed so much of that 
corruption, and what we just saw in 
Loudoun County, Virginia, what we 
just saw unfold in the Commonwealth 
of Virginia. 
The American people are seeing the 
corruption that flows from the dollars 
that flow from this town without any 
responsibility. Again, that is not a par-
tisan statement. Both sides are equally 
guilty of walking into this Chamber 
and writing checks they can’t cash. 
And if we don’t stop it, this country 
will not survive. This country will not 
make it. We will not keep the Republic 
if we keep spending money we don’t 
have. If we keep turning over power to 
a small group of individuals in this 
Chamber, the other Chamber, the other 
end of Pennsylvania Avenue and, oh, 
by the way, the courts to make deci-
sions rather than the people’s Rep-
resentatives. 
It is time, Madam Speaker, for this 
body to function again. And it is time 
for us to do it without regard to who is 
in the other end of Pennsylvania Ave-
nue in the White House. We have a 
duty in Article I to use the power of 
the purse responsibly, to stand up for 
the people, to defend the people, and to 
stop the encroachment in their lives by 
unelected bureaucrats or a President 
using power that has now already in 
three different courts been found to be 
unconstitutionally and unlawfully exe-
cuted against the people while they are 
lose their jobs, lose their livelihoods, 
destroy their lives because they want 
to make a decision that they believe is 
in the interest of them and their fami-
lies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

b 2030 
OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL MASS 
SHOOTING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
SLOTKIN) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in the shadow of a terrible trag-
edy that has shaken my district and 
the entire State of Michigan to its 
core. 
Oxford, Michigan, is a quiet town in 
northern Oakland County. It is a small, 
close-knit 
community 
where 
folks 
know and care for each other. But just 
2 days ago, in less than 5 minutes, the 
heart of the town was ripped out in a 
flurry of screams and gunfire. 
On Tuesday, a 15-year-old boy walked 
into his Oxford High School and took 
the lives of four of his fellow students, 
four young Michiganders with their en-
tire lives ahead of them. 
I mentioned them in our moment of 
silence, but it bears repeating. 
Hana St. Juliana was an exuberant 
freshman on the volleyball and basket-
ball team. She babysat for a friend of 
mine and brought joy to all who knew 
her. She made her high school debut on 
the basketball team on Monday night. 
Hana was 14 years old. 
Madisyn Baldwin was going to grad-
uate this year, and she had already 
been accepted to several colleges, some 
with a full scholarship. She had a 
younger half-brother and two sisters, 
and her friends described her as an art-
ist who loved to draw and read and 
write. Madisyn was 17. 
Tate Myre was a tight end and run-
ning back on the varsity football team 
and an honor student. Already, there is 
a petition with more than 80,000 signa-
tures circulating to rename Oxford’s 
football stadium in honor of Tate. He 
was 16 years old. 
Justin Shilling was a senior getting 
ready for life after high school. He was 
the co-captain of the school’s bowling 
team, and he worked part time at 
Anita’s Kitchen, a restaurant in nearby 
Lake Orion. Justin was 17. 
The loss of these four young people 
has ripped a hole in our community, 
and the trauma inflicted on their 
friends and classmates will never fully 
subside. 
No one has been left unscathed. The 
aftershocks of the senseless act of vio-
lence are being felt across the State, 
most clearly in the 60 school districts 
that have been forced to cancel school 
out of an abundance of caution due to 
copycat threats. 
All of us can see ourselves in the par-
ents, students, and teachers at Oxford, 
but we can’t begin to imagine their 
pain. 
As agonizing as the last few days 
have been, the place to take solace is 
in the incredible response of the hun-
dreds of first responders who jumped 
into action to end the violence before 
more lives were taken. 
Yesterday, I visited the professionals 
at the Oakland County Operations Cen-
ter, which was the eye of the hurricane 
on Tuesday, and heard firsthand ac-
counts of heroism, bravery, and dedica-
tion under extreme stress. 
In the darkness of the event, the 
light we should try and focus on is 
that, in our hour of need, our first re-
sponders were trained and ready. They 
did not hesitate. In the span of just a 
few minutes, the gunman fired 30 shots, 
hitting 11 people. Four of them are 
dead. 
When the gunman was stopped by law 
enforcement inside the school, he had 
18 rounds left. I shudder to think about 
how much more damage could have 
been done if those officers hadn’t 
stopped him so quickly. 
The people who responded on Tues-
day saved lives unequivocally. The 
training, speed, and efficiency of those 
on site made all the difference, and I 
want to speak directly to them for a 
moment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6907 
December 2, 2021 
First, to the teachers who have been 
through so much in these last 2 years 
and who jumped into action when the 
crisis struck; to the police officers and 
sheriff’s deputies who headed straight 
into the school without hesitation and 
who told me, ‘‘We were going inside no 
matter what. We were never going to 
simply stage outside and wait to assess 
the risks to ourselves’’; to all the fire-
fighters and first responders from our 
area and well beyond who didn’t wait 
for 
direction 
and 
simply 
steamed 
straight for Oxford; to the 911 dispatch 
operators who took more than 100 calls 
from terrified children whispering and 
crying from their hiding places, and 
the dispatch shift leaders who ran the 
massive logistical operation to coordi-
nate over 300 first responders at the 
school; and to the doctors, nurses, 
EMS, and hospital staff who put emer-
gency procedures in place and all an-
swered the call to help, what you did 
saved children, and teachers, and ad-
ministrators. 
You saved someone’s child, some-
one’s brother, someone’s mom. You 
kept people on this Earth for their 
families to cherish and hold close. And 
every one of them will remember that 
day and the role you played. There are 
children in that school who will go on 
to be police officers and firefighters 
and doctors because of how you re-
sponded this week, and for that, we 
owe you so much. 
Madam Speaker, over the last few 
days, I have thought a great deal about 
the sacrifices we ask our kids to make 
and the burdens we ask them to bear. 
We are all so exhausted seeing fleeing 
students, panicked parents, and bewil-
dered teachers. 
The inescapable conclusion we must 
draw is that we are failing our chil-
dren, not just failing to keep them safe 
but failing to set an example. Our daily 
rhetoric 
continues 
to 
deteriorate. 
Threats of violence are commonplace. 
As someone who worked alongside 
the military for years, I was trained 
that leadership climate is set at the 
top. Whether you are the leader of a 
platoon or a small town, or simply the 
head of a household, the leadership 
style you use in your own life will be 
internalized by those you lead. It will 
become the standard. Nowhere is this 
more clear than with our kids. 
The hard truth is that violence, in-
cluding gun violence, has become nor-
mal. Threatening someone online has 
become normal. Inciting violence and 
calling for violence has become nor-
mal. People do it online, in neighbor-
hood forums, at school board meetings, 
at hospitals, on airplanes, and even on 
the steps of this Capitol, like it is 
nothing at all, like it is somehow part 
of their freedom of speech. But it is 
not. 
Threatening other people is where 
our freedom of speech ends. But how 
are kids to understand that? How are 
they to rationalize the lessons they 
learned in kindergarten to treat others 
as we would like to be treated if they 
see adults demonstrating the opposite? 
That betrayal has taken hold in the 
roots of our communities. Not a day 
goes by that I don’t hear about it, and 
our kids are watching our every move. 
This tragedy also makes clear that 
we are in desperate need of mental 
health support for our young people. 
Services and providers are scarce, and 
there is no way of meeting the need, es-
pecially in the wake of COVID. 
Our children are using violence, con-
templating 
suicide, 
and 
generally 
struggling more than at any other time 
in our history, and we must acknowl-
edge that and provide the resources to 
our communities to manage the de-
mand. 
In these first 48 hours since the at-
tack, that is where my office and so 
many others have been trying to en-
gage, to find Federal money, to find 
State money. We need to address the 
mental health crisis in this country 
with the seriousness that it demands or 
be prepared to live with the con-
sequences. 
In the immediate aftermath of trag-
edy, in these moments of intense suf-
fering, there is often a need to under-
stand what to do with our pain by 
jumping into politics and policy. I 
must admit, I am torn about that dis-
cussion because my community is still 
reeling from the crisis, and our atten-
tion has been focused on immediate 
crisis response. 
But there are some basic facts that 
simply can’t be swept under the rug: 
that a deadly weapon purchased legally 
fell into the hands of a 15-year-old 
child. I come from a family of gun own-
ers. I was trained to carry two different 
firearms on my person at all times dur-
ing my three tours with the CIA in 
Iraq. 
But if a 15-year-old boy can get ahold 
of a weapon purchased by his father on 
a Friday and use it to terrorize and 
murder his classmates on a Tuesday, 
something in our country is horribly 
wrong. 
Whether we like it or not, Oxford will 
be a town that our kids read about, 
joining a long list of communities that 
have become synonymous with the 
greatest tragedies our country has 
seen: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy 
Hook, Parkland, Santa Fe, and so 
many more. 
This is, sadly, not a new set of issues. 
Long before the events in Oxford, the 
U.S. House passed a bill requiring basic 
background checks for purchases of 
any and all guns, just like we do at 
Walmart now. 
This bill had both Democratic and 
Republican cosponsors. It was one of 
those rare instances of this body rising 
to the occasion with some basic com-
mon sense. We voted on this bill a few 
years ago in the last Congress, and we 
voted on it again this last March 2021. 
That bill is currently sitting in the 
U.S. Senate. It could be voted on to-
morrow if there was a will to act. 
Please, to our colleagues in the Sen-
ate, take up this important bipartisan 
legislation. 
b 2040 
I am also focused on what it means 
to be a responsible gun owner. Michi-
gan is full of them, including my own 
family. But if you are going to own a 
gun, you should be responsible for stor-
ing it safely and for taking basic steps 
to ensure that the gun doesn’t end up 
in the hands of a child or a criminal or 
a dangerous person. Adults should be 
held accountable for how they handle 
their guns. 
This is an issue we are particularly 
watching in Oxford, where the Oakland 
County 
prosecutor 
is 
considering 
charging the parents of the shooter for 
their child’s access to that gun. This is 
one of the areas we are looking at for 
additional legislation, and I know that 
a similar bill is being looked at in the 
Michigan legislature. 
In the coming days and week, more 
facts will emerge from this horrible 
tragedy and help guide our thinking on 
how to ensure that our children—Hana, 
Madisyn, Tate, and Justin—did not die 
in vain. 
To my colleagues in both parties, I 
look to you all, every single one of you, 
to join me in recognizing the pain that 
our community is going through and to 
make sure it means something. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
SENATE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
begin this morning with some good 
news. I am happy to say that last night 
I reached an agreement with Leader 
MCCONNELL, the Speaker, and the 
chairs of the House Appropriations 
Committee and the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee on a continuing reso-
lution that will keep the Federal Gov-
ernment funded through mid-February 
of next year. 
This is a good compromise that al-
lows an appropriate amount of time for 
both parties in both Chambers to finish 
negotiations on appropriations. As I 
said, this is a good compromise that al-
lows an appropriate amount of time for 
both parties in both Chambers to finish 
negotiations on appropriations. 
This morning, the House will start 
the process to take up this government 
funding measure, and we hope they can 
have it passed through their Chamber 
by the end of today. 
Unfortunately, it seems Republican 
dysfunction could be a roadblock to 
averting an unnecessary and dangerous 
government shutdown. Democrats and 
most Republicans, including the Re-
publican leader, have said they don’t 
want to see a Republican shutdown. We 
hope cooler heads will prevail. 
Just as we saw with the NDAA, a few 
individual Republican Senators appear 
determined to derail this important 
legislation because of their opposition 
to the President’s lifesaving vaccine 
guidelines critical to healing our coun-
try in the middle of a pandemic. 
Let’s be clear: If there is a shutdown, 
it will be a Republican anti-vaccine 
shutdown. Democrats want to get the 
government funded as soon as possible. 
It was not easy to reach this deal. It 
took a while to get Republican leader-
ship on board. But I am glad that we 
have gotten it done. I thank my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
for working with us to find a path for-
ward. 
Now all that is left are a few lone 
holdouts who are raising objections 
that are doomed to fail and which can 
be debated elsewhere. There is no rea-
son we should have a Republican shut-
down. I have worked with the Repub-
lican leader on an agreement that will

avoid one. Now, again, I hope cooler 
heads will prevail on the other side so 
we can keep the government funded be-
fore tomorrow’s deadline. 
H.R. 4350 
Now, 
Madam 
President, 
on 
the 
NDAA, once again, Republican dys-
function—that seems to be what is 
going on in the other Chamber, not by 
all Republican Members but by some 
who seem to run the show—the Repub-
lican show, that is. Republican dys-
function has, sadly, caused immense 
damage on another routine, important, 
and largely bipartisan priority, the 
NDAA. 
Democrats have been working in 
good faith with the other side for 
weeks—since before the Thanksgiving 
holiday—to secure an agreement to ap-
prove our annual Defense bill. Last 
night, because of the objections of one 
Republican, the NDAA has, once again, 
been prevented from moving forward. 
As I said last night, the amendment 
pushed by my colleague would cer-
tainly raise a blue slip objection in the 
House and, thus, kill the entire NDAA. 
Now, the Senator from Florida says 
there are no blue slip issues, but this 
isn’t a matter of opinion. The author-
ity here rests with the Ways and Means 
Committee in the House, and they have 
stated, unequivocally, that his pro-
posal would raise blue slip issues. 
There is no objection to the substance 
of the amendment presented by the 
senior Senator from Florida, but it 
simply would violate the provision in 
our Constitution that requires revenue 
measures to originate in the House. 
Other Members had amendments with 
similar issues, but they worked with 
the Ways and Means Committee in the 
House to resolve them because they are 
the arbiter. Senator RUBIO
has not 
done the same. 
It is unfortunate that this misguided 
demand of a single Republican Senator 
is preventing this important legisla-
tion to support our national security 
from moving in the Senate, particu-
larly in light of the fact that so many 
amendments were allowed to be offered 
by Senator REED and Senator INHOFE. 
The number of amendments that would 
be voted on—let me repeat—would ex-
ceed the total number of amend-
ments—the total number of amend-
ments—that were allowed on the NDAA 
under the 4 years of Republican leader-
ship during Donald Trump’s Presi-
dency. 
So to say that we are in a process 
that is unbalanced or unfair is totally 
false. It is just, simply, one person 
holding it up. For the sake of our 
troops and our families, I hope this Re-
publican dysfunction can be addressed. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 3299 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
understand that there is a bill at the 
desk that is due for a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the 
second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3299) to prohibit the Department 
of Defense from discharging or withholding 
pay or benefits from members of the Na-
tional Guard based on COVID–19 vaccination 
status. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION 
ACT 
FOR 
FISCAL 
YEAR 
2022—Continued 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
two-thirds of Americans are worried 
about inflation. About half of the mid-
dle class and 70 percent of low-income 
families just told Gallup that rising 
prices have been a personal hardship 
for their households. That is why 67 
percent of the American people say 
that Washington needs to ‘‘cut back on 
spending and printing money,’’ but 
here in Washington, Democrats are 
bound and determined to do just the 
opposite. They want to try the crazy 
strategy of inflating their way out of 
inflation—another 
massive, 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree. 
Even the most generous estimates, 
when the CBO has to swallow all—all— 
of the Democrats’ accounting gim-
micks at face value, still say their pro-
posal would entail $800 billion in new 
deficit spending over the next 5 years 
alone—over just 5 years. Outside ex-
perts who are allowed to reject the 
Democrats’ obvious budget gimmicks 
find the real cost—the real cost—of 
their bill would actually be close to $5 
trillion. That is with a ‘‘t’’—trillion 
dollars. After a decade, it would in-
crease deficits by $2.8 trillion, but the 
reckless pricetag, actually, isn’t the 
only problem. 
What is remarkable is that the 
Democrats want to spend all these tril-
lions but not leave citizens with any 
impressive, enduring national project 
in return. There is no Hoover Dam, 
Interstate Highway System, or Moon 
landing on the other side of their 
mountains of borrowed money—noth-
ing like that. It is just a giant catalog 
of socialist mediocrity: new entitle-
ments here, new transfer programs 
there, new ways to let bureaucrats run 
families’ lives, and shameless—shame-
less—goodies 
for 
specific 
interest 
groups that support the political left— 
a giant, muddled mess that would leave 
families with fewer childcare choices 
and higher costs, with fewer new pre-
scription drugs and cures, with higher 
prices for less reliable energy. It is, lit-
erally, a reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree that hurts American families and 
actually—believe 
it 
or 
not—helps 
China. 
There are a lot of big, sweeping, rad-
ical changes in their proposal that 
would change families’ lives dramati-
cally and entirely for the worse. But in 
between the sweeping wish-fulfillment 
for people who call themselves ‘‘demo-
cratic socialists,’’ there is also a re-
markable amount of just pure waste, 
absurd—literally absurd—little give-
aways, and interest group goodies. A 
billion here, a billion there, and hope 
the American people won’t notice if it 
is buried in enough bureaucratic gib-
berish. 
Here are just a few examples. 
This bill would supply billions of dol-
lars to help colleges and universities 
indoctrinate college students with even 
more leftwing propaganda and billions 
more to give them made-up Potemkin 
jobs in a make-work program they are 
calling a Civilian Climate Corps—this 
at a time when industries already can-
not find workers. 
Their bill would set aside multiple 
billions of dollars to put Federal Gov-
ernment employees, like IRS agents 
and postal carriers, into brandnew elec-
tric vehicles. 
Earlier this year, the Biden adminis-
tration made sure that luxury Teslas, 
with a sticker price up to $97,000, were 
on the list for government procure-
ment—$97,000 per vehicle. 
So working families might be having 
to choose between heating costs and 
new shoes for the kids. Oh, but don’t 
worry, Democrats will make sure IRS 
auditors can cruise around in Silicon 
Valley’s finest. 
Their proposal would create a huge 
$29 billion slush fund that activists are 
applauding as the foundation for some-
thing called—now, listen to this—a na-
tional 
green 
bank. 
Can 
you 
say 
Solyndra on steroids? An entire bank 
to finance pipe dreams that can’t earn 
support out in the real economy. 
Separately, they are planning to 
spend multiple billions of taxpayer dol-
lars for something the liberals are call-
ing—listen to this one now—tree eq-
uity. I will let that one speak for itself. 
Of course, the Green New Deal folks 
aren’t the only constituency Demo-
crats want to pay off. This reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree is also de-
signed to knock out all their Christmas 
shopping for trial lawyers, Big Labor 
bosses, Ivy League administrators, and 
blue-State millionaires, all in one fell 
swoop. 
There is the State and local tax 
carve-out, the SALT gimmick, that 
would give an extra tax cut to two- 
thirds of the households making a mil-
lion dollars or more a year. Perhaps to

make sure these reckless policies get 
good press, Democrats have included a 
$1.6 billion bailout for the news media. 
I am not making this up. We are essen-
tially talking about government wel-
fare for newsrooms—for newsrooms. All 
this, and it goes on and on and on. 
There is a new special tax break for 
rich 
universities’ 
massive 
endow-
ments—hundreds of millions of dollars 
to overhaul kids’ school lunch menus, 
including making sure they are ‘‘cul-
turally appropriate.’’ I guess they want 
to make sure that children’s cafeteria 
trays are sufficiently woke. 
And goodness knows they couldn’t 
skip over Big Labor. So the Democrats’ 
plan would let working Americans’ 
above-the-line tax deduction for chari-
table contributions expire—that goes 
away—but they would replace it with a 
brandnew deduction that only applies 
to union dues. 
And then there is pure pork of the 
old-school kind. The Speaker of the 
House tried to sneak in hundreds of 
millions of dollars for a special park in 
San Francisco. And the Senate Demo-
cratic leader has spent much trying to 
double the bill’s funding for public 
housing so the chronically mismanaged 
authority in his hometown could get 
$40 billion to clean up its messes. 
There is even what appears to be a 
$33 million kickback that is largely for 
one Democratic Congressman whose 
vote Speaker PELOSI literally had to 
lock down. Out of nowhere, one mostly 
dormant government Commission that 
is important to this particular Demo-
crat’s district gets a funding increase 
of 13,000 percent—13,000 percent. You 
heard that right, a funding increase of 
13,000 percent. What a terrific coinci-
dence for this particular Democratic 
House Member. 
So take a step back. Our colleagues’ 
proposal isn’t some big national leap 
into the 21st century; it is an endless— 
endless—hodgepodge of this nonsense: 
partisan 
back-scratching, 
interest 
group 
giveaways, 
and 
shameless— 
shameless—waste. And through tax 
hikes and inflation, working American 
families will foot the bill. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUREAU OF PRISONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
has been a great source of debate over 
the past couple of years over a very 
basic question: How was Jeffrey Ep-
stein able to take his own life in Fed-
eral prison on August 10, 2019? 
Last week, we found some answers in 
the New York Times. It pointed out a 
series of stunning failures within the 
Bureau of Prisons. 
According to the Times: ‘‘The newly 
obtained records offer no support to 
the explosion of conspiracy theories 
that Mr. Epstein’s death was not a sui-
cide. . . . But they do paint a picture of 
incompetence and sloppiness by some 
within the Bureau of Prisons.’’ 
That incompetence and sloppiness 
was evident from the moment Jeffrey 
Epstein entered the Metropolitan Cor-
rectional Center. On his intake screen-
ing form, Mr. Epstein was described as 
‘‘a Black male,’’ with no prior record of 
sex offense convictions. A 5-second 
Google search would tell you that not 
only was Jeffrey Epstein White, he was 
one of the most notorious sex traf-
fickers in recent history. 
And what about the night he died? He 
had already attempted suicide in the 
weeks leading up to his death, so you 
would think that the officials in the 
Bureau of Prisons would keep close 
watch over this potentially suicidal in-
mate. 
In fact, the opposite happened. Jef-
frey 
Epstein 
was 
left 
alone, 
unmonitored, in his cell. The two offi-
cers on duty were allegedly dozing off 
and scrolling on their phones. And the 
next morning, Epstein was found dead 
with a bed sheet tied around his neck. 
Because of these failures, the survivors 
of Epstein’s despicable crimes will 
never get to see him brought to justice. 
Six 
months 
after 
Epstein 
died, 
former Attorney General Bill Barr 
handpicked Michael Carvajal to lead 
the Bureau of Prisons. It could have 
been a new beginning for the Bureau, a 
chance to get to the bottom of widely 
publicized 
neglect 
and 
mismanage-
ment—and to hold the appropriate par-
ties accountable. But that fresh start 
never came because, since day one, Di-
rector Carvajal of the Bureau of Pris-
ons has shown no intention of reform-
ing that institution. 
Consider the case of the warden who 
ran the Metropolitan Correctional Cen-
ter the night Jeffrey Epstein died. How 
did Director Carvajal respond to that 
warden’s failure of leadership? Well, if 
you can imagine it, he actually re-
warded him. Director Carvajal ap-
pointed the same warden to lead a dif-
ferent facility, the largest Federal pris-
on in the United States: FCI Fort Dix 
in New Jersey. 
And it seems that warden hasn’t 
learned any lessons in leadership since 
Mr. Epstein’s death. Last month, an in-
mate in FCI Fort Dix was attacked 
from behind and stabbed in the eye. 
These are not isolated incidents. For 
years, the Bureau of Prisons has been 
plagued by corruption, chronic under-
staffing, and misconduct by high-rank-
ing officials. And in the nearly 2 years 
since Director Carvajal took control of 
the Bureau, he has failed to address the 
mounting crises in our Nation’s Fed-
eral prison system. 
It is far past time for new, reform- 
minded leadership in the Bureau of 
Prisons. 
A few weeks ago, the Associated 
Press published a breathtaking inves-
tigation into the Bureau. They con-
cluded that it is a ‘‘hotbed of abuse, 
graft and corruption, and has turned a 
blind eye to employees accused of mis-
conduct.’’ 
Since 2019, more than 100 Federal 
prison workers have been arrested for, 
charged with, or convicted of crimes, 
including sexual abuse, murder, and in-
troducing contraband into the prison. 
Altogether, these crimes account for 
two-thirds 
of 
the 
criminal 
cases 
against all Department of Justice per-
sonnel, even though BOP employees 
comprise less than a third of the work-
force. 
I want to share a few of the stories 
from the Associated Press report. At 
one Federal prison in Mississippi, an 
official responsible for investigating 
the misconduct of other staff members 
was arrested for his own misconduct. 
He was not only accused of stalking 
and harassing his fellow employees, but 
he was allowed to remain in his posi-
tion. He was even authorized to con-
tinue investigating one of his accusers. 
In California, a warden of a Federal 
women’s prison was arrested and in-
dicted earlier this year for molesting 
an inmate. He even kept lewd photos of 
the victim on his government-issued 
cell phone. He allegedly told the 
woman that she shouldn’t even try to 
report the assault because he was 
‘‘close friends’’ with the official who 
would investigate it. 
The list goes on. It is a recurring pat-
tern of misconduct by officials within 
the Bureau of Prisons who believe they 
can abuse inmates and break the law 
with impunity. In some cases, that is 
exactly what they have done. 
The details in the AP investigation 
are shocking. And for those of us who 
have been following Director Carvajal’s 
tenure, they are the latest disturbing 
examples of failed leadership. 
Time and again, he has categorically 
failed to uphold his chief responsibility 
as Director. And what is that responsi-
bility? Protecting the health and safe-
ty of inmates and correctional officers. 
Today, 
the 
Bureau 
suffers 
from 
chronic and significant understaffing. 
Director Carvajal has failed to contain 
outbreaks of COVID–19, which has led 
to tens of thousands of inmates and 
staff contracting the virus. And when 
it comes to reforming our Federal pris-
on system, he has failed. 
In 2018, congressional Democrats and 
Republicans came together on an over-
whelmingly bipartisan basis to enact 
the FIRST STEP Act. It was a historic 
piece of reform legislation to create 
new pathways for prison inmates to 
better themselves while they serve 
their time, so they can return to soci-
ety once released. 
Nearly 3 years later, the Bureau of 
Prisons still hasn’t implemented most 
of these reforms. 
One example, under the FIRST STEP 
Act, low-risk inmates are eligible to 
earn time credits, reducing their sen-
tences. They do this by completing pro-
grams designed to prevent them from 
committing another crime. 
Last month, the inspector general at 
the Department of Justice found that

the Bureau of Prisons has not applied 
these earned time credits to any of the 
approximately 60,000 eligible inmates. 
Now the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, which I chair, is charged with 
overseeing the Bureau of Prisons. We 
have tried to get answers from Director 
Carvajal and his team. We have repeat-
edly requested information. 
We have asked for details about the 
inmate banking system. Now, there is 
a heck of a story. It purportedly has 
little oversight by the Bureau of Pris-
ons, has allowed inmates to avoid pay-
ing child support and restitution to 
crime victims and other obligations. 
The Bureau reportedly allowed Larry 
Nassar, 
the 
so-called 
doctor 
who 
abused hundreds of young gymnasts be-
fore he was sentence to life in prison, 
to spend thousands of dollars from his 
Bureau of Prisons account on himself 
but pay only $300 toward the debt he 
owes his victims. 
The Bureau has delayed responding 
to our questions—or just flatout ig-
nored them. 
It is past time to replace Director 
Carvajal. This can’t wait any longer. 
The Associated Press’s investigation 
shows us that lives are literally at 
stake. 
I know Attorney General Garland un-
derstands the urgency. I am calling on 
him today to move immediately to dis-
miss Director Carvajal and to bring 
real reform to the Bureau of Prisons. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Texas. 
CHINA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in my 
lifetime, 
the 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China has gone from a poor and iso-
lated country to one that now accounts 
for 20 percent of global domestic prod-
uct. There is no question that the driv-
ing force behind this dramatic shift is 
the ruthlessness of the Chinese Com-
munist Party led by President Xi. The 
CCP’s ruling strategy can best be de-
scribed as win at all costs, which 
means that China never thinks twice 
about disregarding basic values and 
international norms. But there is no 
question that the most immediate and 
grave threats are against countries 
close to China’s borders. 
Last month, I led a congressional del-
egation to visit the Indo-Pacific to 
learn more from the people on the 
ground doing the hard work about the 
challenges they face and that we face 
in the Indo-Pacific. In my conversa-
tions with leaders in the Philippines, 
Taiwan, and India, I noticed they used 
a different vocabulary to describe Chi-
na’s behavior than what we hear in 
Washington, DC. They didn’t just talk 
about China’s ambitions; they warned 
of its threats of aggression. They didn’t 
just share concerns about China’s uni-
fication with Taiwan; they spoke of the 
potential for an invasion. They didn’t 
just bring up human rights abuses; 
they condemned the blatant genocide 
committed against the Uighurs and 
other ethnic minorities in China. 
Words matter, of course, and the soft 
lexicon that is often used to describe 
the Chinese Communist Party and the 
People’s Republic of China here in the 
United States and particularly inside 
the beltway has the potential to create 
a false impression about China’s objec-
tives, and it plays right into their 
hands. 
I think we should not continue to 
downplay the risks to the global world 
order and to peace itself by what China 
is doing. This isn’t just a government 
interested 
in 
competing 
with 
the 
United States and other countries by 
playing by the rules of the inter-
national order; the Chinese Communist 
Party is an aggressive, even belligerent 
and hostile power that has made eco-
nomic gains through stealing intellec-
tual property and other activities that 
belie its stated ambitions to become 
part of the liberal world order. 
For example, it squashes opposition 
by committing genocide against its 
own people and muzzling—even mur-
dering—dissidents. China has literally 
become a police state, where the vol-
umes of data that they have vacuumed 
up in that country and the ubiquitous 
technical surveillance that is mainly 
cameras that chronicle every aspect of 
the lives of their citizens and the use of 
things like artificial intelligence have 
allowed them to essentially control ev-
erything that does go on in China. And 
these are the same tools that they in-
tend to use on other parts of the world. 
We know China has spent a lot of 
money developing its military re-
sources. It has come a long way, while 
the United States and other countries 
were focused post-9/11 on the Global 
War on Terror. While we were focused 
on the Middle East, the PRC and the 
CCP wasted no time in rebuilding their 
capabilities from a military stand-
point. 
And they are now aggressively claim-
ing other parts of the region, not just 
Taiwan, but contested islands in the 
South China Sea that are claimed by 
Japan, by the Philippines, and other 
countries as well. 
Well, as I mentioned, one of the 
greatest looming threats in the region 
is a potential invasion of Taiwan by 
the People’s Republic of China. 
Of course, as you can see, Taiwan is 
just a small island of about 24 million 
people, just off the coast of mainland 
China. It is not much larger than the 
State of Maryland. 
In every possible way you can imag-
ine, Taiwan is a stark contrast with 
China. For one, it is a true democracy. 
Voters go to the polls with the con-
fidence that the election results are 
not predetermined. Successful busi-
nesses—and there are many of them— 
are built on good old-fashioned hard 
work, not government favoritism. And 
the people in Taiwan—the Republic of 
China—enjoy the same freedoms that 
we do here in the United States: free-
dom of speech, freedom of press, free-
dom of religion, and freedom of assem-
bly. 
Taiwan has been a self-governing en-
tity for more than 70 years, but the 
Chinese Communist Party falsely as-
serts that the island republic is part of 
its territory. Indeed, Taiwan faces 
China as the last outpost of democracy, 
standing 
watch 
against 
authoritarianism. 
Our congressional delegation met 
with the commander of the Indo-Pa-
cific Command who described the cur-
rent power dynamic rather succinctly. 
He said it is not a question of if China 
moves on Taiwan, but a question of 
when. 
Indeed, the language we heard from 
our military leadership and others in 
the region was far more urgent in 
terms of the threat of the People’s Re-
public of China against Taiwan than 
anything I have heard here in Wash-
ington, DC. 
According to our top military lead-
ers, we have an idea how long Xi might 
wait. He himself has said that he wants 
to be ready by 2027. But there is abso-
lutely no guarantee that President Xi 
and the Chinese Communist Party of 
the People’s Republic of China—there 
is no guarantee they won’t move at an-
other time of their choosing. 
As I said, Taiwan is not the only na-
tion on the CCP’s list. China has terri-
torial claims against a number of its 
neighbors. If you closed your eyes and 
just threw a dart at this region, you 
would likely hit one or more of those 
contested 
areas. 
Japan, 
the 
Phil-
ippines, Vietnam, Bhutan, India—all of 
those countries claim sovereign terri-
tory that is also contested and claimed 
by the Chinese Communist Party of the 
People’s Republic of China. 
Of course, it hasn’t even been 25 
years since China took control of Hong 
Kong under the ‘‘one country, two sys-
tems’’ framework. China had promised 
Hong Kong it would retain a high de-
gree of autonomy for at least a half a 
century, but, obviously, Beijing eroded 
the freedoms and independence of Hong 
Kong to the point of basically hijack-
ing that city and that entity. 
The Indian Minister of Foreign Af-
fairs in Delhi told our delegation that 
Taiwan isn’t the problem; it is a China 
problem. And I think he has a point. 
In other words, what is at stake here 
is much larger than the future of just 
one nation. It is the entire scope of 
Beijing’s power and its ambitions in 
the region. Taiwan is not the final 
goal. It is the next step in a quest to 
reach regional dominance. 
Taiwan will likely be the first target 
because it has been identified by Presi-
dent Xi and the Chinese Communist 
Party, but it certainly won’t be the 
last. I think it would be the ultimate 
in naivety, first, to think, well, this is 
just about Taiwan. It is not just about 
Taiwan. China will continue to threat-
en; intimidate; and, unfortunately, I 
think, ultimately threaten and invade 
its neighbors. And if that aggression 
goes unchecked, the CCP’s power grab 
will reach further and further. 
Plus, I believe in the power of deter-
rence, what Ronald Reagan called

peace through strength. Nobody wants 
a military conflict in this region—no-
body. 
If the CCP can attain its goals with-
out a shot being fired, they will try to 
do that. They are already trying to do 
that. But the fact of the matter is, if 
the People’s Republic of China and the 
Chinese Communist Party worked to 
conduct a military invasion of Taiwan, 
there are a multitude of risks of mis-
takes, miscalculations, and other dan-
gers that could lead to a larger con-
flict. 
And I believe we have a responsi-
bility in the United States to make 
sure, to the extent humanly possible, 
that that does not happen. We want 
peace, but we also want to stand up to 
the kind of aggression that we are see-
ing in practice and being threatened in 
the Indo-Pacific region. I believe that 
countering and first confronting the 
threats from the PRC is one of the 
greatest national security imperatives 
of our generation. 
Russia, obviously, is a significant 
power, mainly because it holds nuclear 
weapons; but it mainly tries to find 
places where the United States is hav-
ing a hard time and tries to make 
those situations more challenging for 
us. It doesn’t compare to the Chinese 
Communist Party and the PRC in 
terms of its regional ambitions, its at-
tempt to project its power and its con-
trol over the region. 
We need to reorient the way that our 
country views and responds to this 
threat, and I believe that time is of the 
essence. As I said, some people have 
said that President Xi could wait until 
as late as 2027 to try to take Taiwan, 
but there is no guarantee that it 
couldn’t happen earlier if they deem it 
an opportunity to exist for them to do 
so. 
The longer Beijing is treated as a 
reasonable, goal-oriented country by 
the international community, the more 
aggressive it will become. One seem-
ingly small step we must take is to de-
scribe China’s actions with accurate 
terms. We can’t do the CCP any favor 
using watered-down euphemisms like 
human rights abuses when what we are 
really talking about is genocide. Here 
in the Senate, as we know, words are 
important, but those words need to be 
accompanied with action. 
We will soon vote on the National 
Defense Authorization Act, which will 
help us raise the issue and visibility of 
this potential conflict and raise the op-
portunity for deterrence in response to 
growing threats posed by China. We 
can do good work here on the Defense 
authorization bill to raise the cost to 
the PRC in the event they decided to 
invade Taiwan. 
The Defense Authorization Act in-
cludes a bipartisan bill I introduced 
with Senator DUCKWORTH
called the 
Taiwan Partnership Act. This bill 
would establish a formal partnership 
between the U.S. National Guard and 
the 
Taiwanese 
defense 
forces 
to 
strengthen Taiwan’s preparedness. 
Should troops need to deploy quickly 
in the event of a crisis, they would be 
armed with the same knowledge and 
skills as our dedicated U.S. National 
Guardsmen. This would also help Tai-
wan build up much of its asymmetric 
defenses. 
The Defense Authorization Act also 
includes legislation I introduced with 
Senator KING, from Maine, to ensure 
that the United States and Taiwan can 
improve 
defense 
interoperability. 
There shouldn’t be any barriers to co-
operating on important security meas-
ures like integrated air and missile de-
fense systems. 
The Defense Authorization Act in-
cludes other provisions to increase de-
fense cooperation with Taiwan and 
equip the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command 
with greater resources. It also ensures 
that the United States will take a 
stronger approach and confront the 
threats being made by the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
This is not a partisan issue, as you 
can tell. After the delegation I led to 
Taipei, it was followed on by a bipar-
tisan coalition mainly from Members 
of the House, and I think it is abso-
lutely critical that that spirit of bipar-
tisanship and the reality of bipartisan-
ship continues to exist when it comes 
to the threat posed by the People’s Re-
public of China and the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
I appreciate colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle who have championed the 
provisions I mentioned and those who 
may have other ideas about how we can 
deter acts of aggression, not only 
against Taiwan but against other coun-
tries in the region when it comes to 
disputed islands and other territory. 
I want to thank Chairman REED, 
Ranking Member INHOFE, and our col-
leagues on the Armed Services Com-
mittee for all the work they have put 
into this bill so far. One of our most 
solemn responsibilities is to provide for 
the common defense, and this is the 
best way to ensure that our national 
defense is prepared to meet the chal-
lenges on the horizon. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
NOMINATION OF JEROME POWELL 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Jerome 
Powell was a better choice for Federal 
Reserve Chair than Lael Brainard, but 
that alone is not a good enough reason 
to confirm Chairman Powell for a sec-
ond term. Chairman Powell has pre-
sided over a series of failures at the 
Fed, while the Fed’s actions during his 
tenure 
have 
harmed 
working-class 
Americans and worsened inequality. 
The Senate should not support his re-
nomination. 
The core mission of the Federal Re-
serve from the very beginning has been 
to foster stable prices and ensure a 
sound currency. No one—no one—can 
seriously argue that the Fed has ac-
complished this mission under Mr. 
Powell’s leadership. After years of 
reckless policy and months of obfusca-
tion, inflation now exceeds 6 percent, 
the highest rate of inflation in 30 
years—the highest rate of inflation in 
30 years. 
An inflationary economy rewards 
will-be speculators and the holders of 
large assets and debts like, for in-
stance, the Federal Government or 
giant corporations, but it ruins respon-
sible citizens who are just trying to 
save for their retirements or maybe 
their kids’ colleges. 
In the worst-case scenario, the value 
of money can collapse, endangering so-
ciety itself. In less catastrophic but 
still serious conditions, Americans who 
have played by the rules for many 
years, responsibly working and saving, 
see the value of their money slowly 
erode over time. 
Nearly half of all Americans have no 
exposure whatsoever to the stock mar-
ket, not a single stock or mutual fund 
or pension—no exposure to the stock 
market. Their money is usually held in 
low-interest checking accounts, sav-
ings accounts, certificates of deposit, 
and cash. The Fed’s extreme low-inter-
est-rate policy means their thrift and 
prudence earns them nothing. In fact, 
it sets them back every day with this 
inflationary spiral. Money outside the 
stock market loses value every day 
when inflation is at 30-year highs and 
interest rates are near record lows. 
Likewise, 6 percent inflation has to-
tally wiped out any nominal wage 
gains for workers. In fact, inflation-ad-
justed weekly earnings are down 1.6 
percent compared with a year ago. Real 
inflation-adjusted wages are down from 
last year when employers across the 
country report shortages of workers. 
That is because inflation is eating 
away at all those wage gains. And 
there is no guarantee that inflation at 
6 percent is the ceiling. 
Still, the Fed has refused to change 
course even as prices rose on every-
thing from groceries to gasoline. Chair-
man Powell insisted for months that 
the pain was only ‘‘temporary’’ or 
‘‘transitory.’’ According to so-called 
‘‘experts,’’ inflation would simply van-
ish once Pete Buttigieg sorted out the 
supply chains and we got the Delta var-
iant under control. But after months of 
skyrocketing prices, Chairman’s Pow-
ell’s confidence looks not only mis-
placed and misinformed but reckless. 
This week, Mr. Powell admitted that 
he 
would 
retire—retire—the 
word 
‘‘transitory,’’ the very word he helped 
popularized. If only American families 
could so easily retire the devastating 
effects of inflation on their monthly 
budgets. 
Mr. Powell has directly contributed 
to this inflation. He has maintained 
the Fed’s so-called emergency mone-
tary policies a decade after the emer-
gency of the financial crisis had ended. 
That means the Fed had already ex-
hausted the normal tools of monetary 
policy when the pandemic hit last 
spring. It had to prop up the economy 
through unprecedented levels of gov-
ernment intervention. These policies,

December 2, 2021 
while perhaps justified for a very brief 
period of uncertainty in the spring of 
2020—very 
brief—policies 
which 
in-
cluded huge purchases of government 
bonds, mortgage debt, and corporate 
debt—but they were not justified after 
that, just as they weren’t justified be-
fore it, even as the Fed was continuing 
unparalleled levels of quantitative eas-
ing. 
As a result, the Fed’s balance sheet 
has ballooned to $9 trillion, and it con-
tinues to grow by more than $100 bil-
lion a month. Nine trillion dollars. Let 
me put that in perspective. The Fed’s 
balance sheet after the financial crisis 
barely surpassed $2 trillion. 
The chief result of these policies dur-
ing the pandemic has been to boost 
asset prices, especially the stock mar-
ket valuations of giant corporations. 
But the price of these gains has been 
inflation, 
which 
especially 
harms 
working-class Americans. After releas-
ing a torrent of cash into the economy, 
it is no surprise that prices are rising 
in this flood of cheap money. 
This week, Chairman Powell testified 
that 
he 
might—he 
might—unwind 
these policies a little faster than pre-
viously planned, but even if the Fed 
follows through—and I will believe it 
when I see it after the last many years 
of radical emergency monetary pol-
icy—it will still be too little, too late. 
The simple fact is, the Fed, under 
Chairman 
Powell’s 
leadership, 
has 
forced millions of American families to 
choose whether to pay the mortgage or 
feed their families or fill up their gas 
tanks, heat their homes, or maybe buy 
a couple of extra Christmas presents. 
That is failure. 
While inflation is the Fed’s worst 
failure under Chairman Powell, it is 
not their only failure. At a time when 
they cannot achieve their core mission 
of price stability, they are adopting an-
cillary missions like ‘‘woke’’ activism 
at the Fed. The Fed has joined an 
international effort devoted to ‘‘green-
ing’’ the financial system, whatever 
that means. Fed branches around the 
country are even spreading critical 
race theory, claiming that terms like 
‘‘Founding Fathers’’ and ‘‘blacklist’’ 
are ‘‘biased’’ and sharing radical mate-
rials that claim that—this is a direct 
quote from some of the materials that 
Fed branches have shared—‘‘race-neu-
tral policies uphold racism.’’ Think 
about that. The Fed’s core mission is 
to maintain price stability. While they 
fail on that mission, they are teaching 
their employees that race-neutral poli-
cies are racist. 
We might chuckle and shake our 
heads and have a good laugh when this 
kind of nonsense happened at Bard Col-
lege or some other college campus, but 
now it is happening at the Nation’s 
central bank, which plays a role in de-
termining whether we end up rich or 
poor. This mission creep is alarming, 
especially when the Fed is failing to 
fulfill its core mission. 
I know many people have made ex-
cuses for the Fed, and they defended 
Mr. Powell’s tenure. They said infla-
tion was not his fault or primarily the 
Fed’s fault. But it is true the Demo-
crats have been spending trillions of 
dollars this year we don’t have. But, as 
Bill Parcells said about NFL teams, 
you are what your record says you are. 
The Fed’s record is 6 percent inflation, 
the worst inflation in 30 years. 
Most Americans live in a world of ac-
countability and consequences, the 
lack of which is one of the things they 
hate most about Washington. Failure 
in Washington is too often rewarded. 
The Fed has manifestly failed during 
Chairman 
Powell’s 
tenure, 
further 
skewing our economy in favor of the 
wealthy while the working class suf-
fers. There have to be consequences for 
this kind of failure. Jerome Powell is 
not the right choice to continue to lead 
the Federal Reserve. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SENATE AGENDA 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the Defense bill that is currently be-
fore the Senate and note that the ma-
jority leader this morning made some 
mention and some complaints about 
substantive, timely, and important 
amendments that are being offered by 
my colleagues. He was particularly agi-
tated, it seems, about an amendment 
dealing with communist China. 
Well, the U.S. Senate has a lot of 
work to do by the end of the year. We 
need to fund the government. We need 
to prevent a shutdown. We need to deal 
with the debt ceiling. Democrats are 
going to need to lift that. We need to 
make sure that our troops are funded 
and that we deal with the Defense bill. 
These are some of the important issues 
that are before the Senate. 
Yet, here we are, near the end of the 
year, scrambling to get it all done in 
just a couple of weeks—no way to run 
the U.S. Senate. We haven’t had an ap-
propriations bill brought to the floor 
all year, and the Defense bill has been 
sitting in limbo for months. 
The Armed Services Committee actu-
ally finished marking up this bill in 
July. It is a bipartisan bill. It passed 
the vote in the committee by 23 to 3. 
Things don’t get a lot more bipartisan 
than that. 
So, 
typically, 
the 
Senate 
starts 
working on the Defense bill and then 
negotiates over the next couple of 
months. We start in June. But, instead, 
we have gone months and months and 
months. 
We have seen the disastrous collapse 
and fall and withdrawal in Afghani-
stan, and yet no Defense bill to the 
floor of the U.S. Senate. 
So what did the Democrats try to do 
instead? 
Well, they pushed a very partisan 
agenda and brought to the floor two 
bills on election takeovers. And the 
Democrats also seem to be very ob-
sessed with their own bill. They want 
to call it Build Back Better, something 
like that. I will tell you, it is a bill 
that is going to break the backs of 
American families. 
So now here we are, just at the dead-
line, and the majority leader is finally 
getting around to dealing with a bill 
that has to do with supporting the 
troops. It seems to me that is like a 
kid with a term paper that is due to-
morrow. It is the night before, and 
they are going to start writing the 
term paper. 
Well, if you want to get it right, it 
takes a longer process than that. It is 
a long process, generally, because it is 
that important for the Nation. Every 
Senator wants to be involved. 
Yet, through the procrastination by 
the majority leader, the Defense bill 
has been delayed. 
Now, I have made the case that, 
frankly, national security has been a 
very low priority of this President and 
this administration and the majority 
party in the House and in the Senate. 
And the reason I say that, exhibit A, is 
the fact that the budget that President 
Biden proposed when he came into of-
fice—and let’s be frank. The budget he 
proposed was a massive, supersizing of 
the size of the Federal Government— 
more money for this, more money for 
that, more money for everything ex-
cept for two items alone. Only two 
items in the entire Federal budget 
came in to grow at a rate less than in-
flation—less than inflation. 
Now, what were those two items? De-
fense and homeland security. That tells 
me how this administration prioritizes 
the role of our Nation’s security for 
our country. 
So, finally, we have gotten to work 
on this bill, and there are some con-
cerns because amendments need to be 
voted on, debated, brought to this 
floor. 
I have introduced an amendment 
with the ranking member of the For-
eign Relations Committee to sanction 
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. There is bi-
partisan agreement that that pipeline 
needed to be sanctioned, and we have 
been fighting for that together in a bi-
partisan way through multiple admin-
istrations. 
This is Vladimir Putin’s pipeline to 
which Joe Biden has given the stamp of 
approval. It is a weapon that Putin is 
going to be using to hold half of Europe 
hostage. And under what this adminis-
tration has been doing on energy—pe-
nalizing American energy production 
and begging Putin to produce more and 
sell it to us—this has been a jackpot 
for Vladimir Putin. 
Our amendment would do the right 
thing 
and 
block 
this 
President’s 
present to Vladimir Putin—a Christ-
mas present. And this is at a time with

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8881 
December 2, 2021 
Joe Biden inflation that we have many 
Americans worrying if they are going 
to even be able to afford to buy Christ-
mas presents. This is no time for our 
Nation to give this present to Vladimir 
Putin. 
The Republican Senator from Ohio 
has introduced an important amend-
ment to provide lethal aid to Ukraine. 
Vladimir Putin has 100,000 troops right 
now staged on the border with Ukraine. 
We ought to stand by Ukraine and pass 
that amendment. 
The Senator from Montana has an 
amendment to block Joe Biden from 
sending $400,000 to the families of ille-
gal immigrants. An open border is a 
threat to our national security, and 
these payments would cause a mad 
rush if not a stampede to the country 
and into the country, the way the bor-
der has been left open. 
There are lots of important amend-
ments, and we ought to be having a fair 
and open debate. This is supposed to be 
the greatest deliberative body in the 
world, and yet the majority leader has 
tried to cut off debate on some of the 
most important issues facing our Na-
tion. 
Why? Because we can hear the clock 
ticking, that is why. He has dragged 
his feet for months, and now, he wants 
to force us into a mad dash to close 
this. 
Look, it is a disservice to our troops. 
It is a disservice to our allies. It is a 
disservice to the people of our Nation. 
And yet, this morning, the majority 
leader is pointing his finger. He came 
to the floor. He attacked Republicans. 
We didn’t make him delay this bill 
for month after month after month. 
This is a choice that the majority lead-
er has made. 
It does seem that the other Demo-
crats have basically higher priorities 
than our Nation’s defense: election 
takeovers, new entitlements, amnesty 
for illegal immigrants. 
It is no way to govern, no way to 
make important decisions, no way to 
run the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
NOMINATION OF BRIAN EDDIE NELSON 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I urge 
my colleagues to join me in confirming 
Brian Nelson to serve as Under Sec-
retary for Terrorism and Financial 
Crimes at the Department of Treasury. 
Mr. Nelson is highly qualified. He has 
had years of dedicated public service to 
our country. 
Early in his career, he clerked for 
two distinguished Federal judges. He 
served in the National Security Divi-
sion at the Department of Justice, first 
as special counsel to the Assistant At-
torney General for National Security, 
later as the Division’s Deputy Chief of 
Staff. 
In these roles, Mr. Nelson supported 
the development, the implementation, 
the coordination, and the review of 
U.S. intelligence, counterintelligence, 
counterterrorism, and national secu-
rity policies. 
He went to work for the California 
Department of Justice, where he served 
as special assistant attorney general 
and then as general counsel to then-at-
torney general, now-Vice President 
HARRIS. 
He worked to combat threats like 
human and drug trafficking by pros-
ecuting international criminals, starv-
ing them of their financial resources. 
As Under Secretary, Mr. Nelson will 
be responsible for protecting our finan-
cial system from terrorists, from rogue 
states, 
money 
launderers, 
weapons 
proliferators, and other criminals who 
threaten our national security. 
His nomination is another example of 
the Biden administration’s serious— 
underline ‘‘serious’’—efforts to protect 
both our economy and our national se-
curity. 
He would take on this job at a crit-
ical time for protecting our country’s 
national security, as we work to re-
build alliances abroad, while threats of 
domestic terrorism are on the rise at 
home. 
Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and 
Financial Intelligence is one of the cor-
nerstones of our country’s efforts. That 
is the importance of this nomination of 
Mr. Nelson, one of our country’s efforts 
to combat terrorist financing here and 
around the world. 
The FBI Director recently testified 
that racially motivated and anti-gov-
ernment extremists are likely to be the 
biggest domestic threat this year and 
in 2022. 
Think about that. The FBI Director 
testified that racially motivated and 
anti-government extremists—and we 
remember that day so well just 10 
months ago—11 months ago. They are 
the likely biggest domestic threats to 
our country this year and next year. 
Mr. Nelson will be the first African 
American serving in this important na-
tional security position. When we have 
people in these roles who reflect the 
country they serve, we get better, more 
competent government. 
That is what always flummoxes me 
about hiring practices in this body and 
around the country. When you hire 
people that don’t necessarily look like 
you, you get a better office that under-
stands different perspectives. It under-
stands better the way this country 
works and helps us to better serve the 
people whom we serve. 
Unfortunately, we have seen far too 
many of this administration’s nomi-
nees held up for months in the nomina-
tions process. You just heard an exam-
ple of that in the speech right before 
me; not because of their background, 
experience, and qualifications—those 
are unquestioned in Mr. Nelson—but 
for reasons completely unrelated to 
that nomination. 
That is what has happened here. It is 
the kind of partisan posturing the 
American people hate. Blocking crit-
ical national security and other policy 
nominees for months over unrelated 
policy issues is counterproductive; it is 
misguided; and it is wrong for our 
country. 
Going 
after 
human 
traf-
ficking, going after drug trafficking, 
going after international criminals of 
all kinds isn’t a partisan issue; it is 
something my Republican colleagues 
and I work together on all the time. So 
let’s come together today and confirm 
Mr. Nelson, who is exceptionally well 
qualified. 
He is joined today by his wife and his 
son. 
I urge this body to support Mr. Nel-
son’s nomination, getting in place 
right away an important part of our 
national security team. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. President, under the agreement 
reached by the two leaders on Novem-
ber 16, the Senate will now vote on con-
firmation of the Nelson nomination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8882 
December 2, 2021 
The nomination was confirmed. 
(Mr. LUJA´ N assumed the Chair.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon table and the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursu-
ant to S. Res. 27, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee being tied on the question 
of reporting, I move to discharge the 
Senate Judiciary Committee from fur-
ther consideration of the nomination of 
Rachael S. Rollins, of Massachusetts, 
to be United States Attorney for the 
District of Massachusetts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. For the information 
of all Senators, we expect the vote on 
the motion to discharge to occur later 
this afternoon. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
VACCINE MANDATE 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this always 
happens near the kick-the-can funding 
deadlines that we are now approaching. 
There is controversy surrounding what 
will and what will not make it into the 
continuing resolution; that is, the leg-
islation funding the government for a 
finite period of time upon the expira-
tion of a spending period. 
In the House of Representatives, the 
debate and controversy continued late 
into last night, and may well still con-
tinue later today. 
Here in the Senate, there are a num-
ber of Senators, including me, who are 
not inclined to give consent to expedite 
a funding measure that supports and 
funds President Biden’s unconstitu-
tional and sweeping vaccine mandate 
without holding a vote on that man-
date and whether we should fund that 
part of government charged with en-
forcing it. 
Now, to be very clear about all of 
this, Senator SCHUMER, as the majority 
leader, could have done this without 
our help if he had started this process 
weeks ago or even days ago. He could 
have held votes and passed this resolu-
tion without needing to ask for the 
help of those of us who feel this way, 
who are not inclined to help him do it. 
Senator SCHUMER is in a bind, due to 
his own delay and his own denial. He is 
asking all of us to help him. 
Now, I have offered a very simple so-
lution, a very reasonable solution. I am 
not asking that a poison pill or a pet 
project be included, no. I am not ask-
ing for dramatic reforms or draconian 
cuts. Far from it. I just want to vote on 
one amendment. I want the Members of 
this body to go on record on whether 
they support funding—in this bill— 
President Biden’s vaccine mandate. 
The American people have a right to 
know, through our votes, where we 
stand and where we stand in connec-
tion with this bill, on a germane 
amendment—one that pertains to that, 
a simple up or down, yes or no—simple 
majority vote. That is all I am asking. 
Let me first explain a little bit about 
the recent history of this situation. 
While those involved in this effort have 
been accused by many in elected office 
and in the press of brinksmanship, we 
have been nothing but consistent and 
clear and open about our position for 
weeks now—in fact, for a month. 
On November 3, a group of Senators— 
15 of us, in fact—declared our inten-
tions, sending this letter to Senator 
SCHUMER. And in this letter, we made 
very clear that we will ‘‘not support— 
and will use all means at our disposal 
to oppose—legislation that funds or in 
any way allows the enforcement of 
President Biden’s employer vaccine 
mandate.’’ 
Now, 15 Senators have signed this 
letter. And there it is right there in 
black and white—the words that I just 
read in that letter from a month ago. 
The letter—again, written back at the 
beginning 
of 
November—specifically 
mentions this funding deadline—the 
one we are now approaching; the one 
that is hitting us tomorrow night—as 
one for Senator SCHUMER and our col-
leagues to be aware of that we made 
our intentions clear. We did so out of 
courtesy to the majority leader and to 
those we represent: to the American 
people, those who will be affected by 
these matters. 
And now, as a matter of political 
convenience, he and others are saying 
‘‘their unwillingness to come to the 
table,’’ which is the reason we are now 
approaching the deadline without an 
agreement, somehow amounts to an 
act of brinksmanship on our part. 
That portrayal is disingenuous, and 
it is wrong. After running out the 
clock, 
knowingly, 
deliberately 
not 
coming to the table to negotiate, and 
ignoring our clear, public position, 
Senator SCHUMER is now accusing us of 
wanting to shut down the government 
because we refuse to help him cram 
through a bill that we have already ex-
plicitly stated we are against. We are 
providing every opportunity to avoid a 
shutdown, and all we ask for is a sim-
ple up-or-down vote. 
Now, I stand by the commitment I 
made not to support or grant consent 
to pass or expedite a measure that 
funds, supports, or allows for the en-
forcement of the President’s vaccine 
mandates. 
Now, it is true that the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has issued 
an order halting enforcement of the 
OSHA mandate, and that OSHA has 
temporarily halted the enforcement of 
that particular mandate. That does not 
in any way remove our obligation here 
in Congress to protect our Constitu-
tional role and to prevent unconstitu-
tional measures, laws, and regulations 
from afflicting the American people. 
We still don’t know the final out-
come of that litigation. In any event, 
we 
have 
an 
independent 
responsi-
bility—constitutionally and morally— 
to make sure that what we do here has 
our oversight and that we don’t spend 
money on things that most Americans 
find abhorrent. 
Each of us did, in fact, swear an oath 
to the Constitution, and the Constitu-
tion does not grant the Federal Gov-
ernment the authority to implement a 
mandate of this sort. It just doesn’t. 
You can search it; you will not find 
that authority. The Constitution cer-
tainly does not grant the President of 
the United States the authority to im-
plement such a mandate without the 
explicit authorization of the people’s 
elected lawmakers in Congress. 
Make no mistake, this mandate is 
not only immoral; it is also unconsti-
tutional. For that reason alone, I must 
oppose it. 
But the harms certainly don’t stop 
with the damage that is being done to 
our constitutional order. Millions of 
Americans are at risk of losing their 
jobs due to this mandate. While court 
orders are offering at least a temporary 
protection, these Americans are still 
anxiously awaiting lasting protection 
from Congress, and currently could re-
ceive at a moment’s notice the final ul-
timatum to be vaccinated or lose their 
jobs. 
In fact, in fear of the huge fines that 
the Biden administration is threat-
ening against businesses that don’t 
comply once the mandate is enforced, 
many companies are already imposing 
these requirements on their workers. 
Countless businesses and hundreds of 
Utahns who are at risk of closure or 
dismissal have reached out to me. 
Their 
stories 
are 
heart-wrenching. 
These are good people. They are our 
friends and our neighbors. They are 
neighborhood businesses and American 
manufacturers, mothers and fathers 
trying to get by in increasingly dif-
ficult economic times. There are mil-
lions of them across the country. Over 
half a million workers in Utah alone 
are at risk of unemployment due to 
this mandate. 
As I have said each time I have spo-
ken on this, I am not against the vac-
cine. In fact, I have gotten the vaccine. 
My family has gotten the vaccine. I 
have encouraged people to get the vac-
cine. I am against the mandate. 
I recognize that these vaccines are 
protecting Americans from the harms 
of COVID–19, and that the government 
has no business, no authority, and no 
justification to make millions of Amer-
icans second-class, unemployable pari-
ahs. Even if the Federal Government 
did have that authority, which it

doesn’t, the President of the United 
States could not exercise it unilater-
ally, not without an act of Congress. 
Our economic condition is increas-
ingly dire. Inflation is becoming long- 
lasting. The supply chain crisis has 
shown the prime value of American 
workers. You know, I can’t think of a 
worse time to kick them to the curb. 
I want to be very clear: I don’t want 
to shut down the government. The only 
thing I want to shut down is Congress’s 
funding enforcement of an immoral, 
unconstitutional 
vaccine 
mandate. 
However, if the choice is between tem-
porarily suspending nonessential func-
tions on the one hand and on the other 
hand standing idle, as up to 45 million 
Americans lose their jobs, their liveli-
hoods, and their ability to work, I will 
stand with American workers every 
time. That is not a closed question. 
I 
stand 
with 
American 
workers 
throughout Utah and across America. I 
stand with moms and dads needing 
gifts and paychecks before the holi-
days. 
I stand by what I and others com-
mitted to as our word, that word given 
a month ago without response. I won’t 
support a continuing resolution that 
funds President Biden’s grievous, im-
moral, unconstitutional vaccine man-
date, and I just want to vote on it in 
connection with this spending bill. All 
I am asking for is a vote. It would take 
15 minutes. We could do it right now, 
in fact. 
If Senator SCHUMER wants to avoid 
this vote so badly that he will shut 
down the government rather than hold 
it, he should explain why. We can fix 
this situation right now. Let’s hold a 
vote. Let’s hold it right now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 8 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on 
the floor today to ask for unanimous 
consent from my colleagues to proceed 
to H.R. 8, the House-passed, bipartisan, 
comprehensive background checks bill. 
I want to tell you why I am making 
this request. 
I understand the low likelihood of 
success, but I hope many of my col-
leagues took a minute to watch cell 
phone video from the school shooting 
in Michigan yesterday—on Tuesday, 
excuse me. It is absolutely terrifying 
to watch in real time children fleeing 
their classroom in fear that their lives 
were about to be ended. One hundred 9– 
1-1 calls came into the police during 
the shooting. Surveillance footage re-
portedly shows the gunman entering 
the bathroom with a backpack, then 
exiting a minute later without the 
backpack but with the handgun. He 
then started firing at students. When 
they started to run, he ‘‘methodically 
and deliberately’’ walked down the 
hallway and aimed his gun into class-
rooms at students who were unable to 
escape. 
We think about the damage done and 
the number of lives lost—four so far— 
and those who were injured, but, real-
ly, the damage is so much broader be-
cause all of those kids who fled that vi-
olence, all of those kids who now don’t 
think of school as a safe place—they 
are going through trauma and will go 
through trauma that may take a life-
time to address. Multiply that times 
millions because that is what is hap-
pening to kids all across this country 
who don’t feel school is a safe place 
any longer, who don’t think their 
neighborhoods are a safe place any 
longer, who grow up in parts of this 
country in which everyday gun vio-
lence is routine. They don’t believe 
they will live past the age of 25. 
The damage happening across this 
country is acute. It is real. It is perva-
sive. This is an epidemic of gun vio-
lence that exists in the United States 
and nowhere else. The risk, though, is 
that this country thinks about gun vio-
lence only when there is a mass shoot-
ing or only when there is a shooting at 
a school. 
On Tuesday, the same day that the 
country was captivated by these terri-
fying 
images 
out 
of 
Oxford 
High 
School, in Taylor, TX, four bodies were 
found at a home in that town after an 
apparent murder-suicide. Police said 
that Anthony Davis, 57 years old, shot 
and killed his wife, his wife’s stepchild, 
and the stepchild’s romantic acquaint-
ance—four people dead in Taylor, TX. 
Nobody knows about that nationally. 
Nobody knows about the other 50 to 100 
people who died of gun violence on 
Tuesday. 
This happens every single day in this 
country at a rate 10 times higher than 
any other country in the high-income 
world. It only happens in the United 
States of America. And we let it hap-
pen as a body. We let it happen as a 
body because it is not that we are un-
lucky in the United States; this is a 
policy choice that we make. 
Let’s be honest—the reason that we 
can’t get anything done in the Senate 
is not because there is a disagreement 
amongst our constituents about what 
to do. Our constituents, Republicans 
and Democrats, support measures like 
universal background checks. In fact, 
there is almost nothing in the political 
world that enjoys such high support as 
universal background checks. Eighty 
percent, ninety percent of Americans— 
the majority of Republicans, Demo-
crats, gun owners, non-gun owners— 
support universal background checks. 
But we can’t get it done because it 
seems as if many of my colleagues here 
care more about the health of the gun 
industry and their profits than they do 
about the health of our kids. Gun in-
dustry profits are being put ahead of 
the safety of my children, of our chil-
dren. 
Shooting after shooting. Republicans 
in this body have refused to do any-
thing meaningful that would reduce 
this pace of carnage, both in our 
schools and on the streets of America. 
As I said, it is not as if we don’t know 
what the answer is. 
Let me give you a remarkable sta-
tistic. In 2020, we saw a pretty substan-
tial increase in violent crime all across 
the country. That increase was about 5 
percent, and a lot of that was gun 
crime. Gun crime went up by 25 percent 
during 2020. But let’s break down that 
number between the States that have 
universal background checks and the 
States that don’t have universal back-
ground checks. There was a 5-percent 
overall increase in violent crime in the 
United States, but in 2020, in States 
that did not have and don’t have uni-
versal background checks—meaning a 
criminal can get a gun at a gun show 
or online without any background 
check—in those States, violent crime 
went up 8 percent higher than the na-
tional average. What about the States 
like Connecticut that have universal 
background checks, where we make 
sure everybody gets a background 
check before they buy a gun? In those 
States, violent crime went up in 2020 
by less than 1 percent. That is pretty 
stunning. On a percentage basis, vio-
lent crime goes up by eight times the 
level in States without universal back-
ground checks as in States with uni-
versal background checks. 
I can just run through the litany of 
studies that show the difference in 
murder rates, in gun crime between 
States that have universal background 
checks and those that don’t. One of the 
most recent studies from 2019, a Har-
vard study, shows a 15-percent dif-
ference. Now, that is surprising be-
cause no matter how strong Connecti-
cut’s background checks law is, States 
that don’t have background checks end 
up allowing people to buy guns there, 
and they come into Connecticut. So 
until we have a national requirement 
that everybody go through a back-
ground check before, at the very least, 
they buy a gun at a commercial sale, 
there is nothing Connecticut can do to 
make itself completely immune to the 
epidemic of illegal guns. 
That is why we are on the floor 
today, myself, Senator BLUMENTHAL, 
and Senator DURBIN, to ask our col-
leagues to pass into law a bipartisan 
piece of legislation that has already 
passed the House of Representatives. 
This is a bill that would expand back-
ground checks to all sales in this coun-
try, with certain exceptions for trans-
fers between immediate family mem-
bers. This is a bill, as I mentioned, that 
is supported by the vast majority of 
Americans—one of the most popular 
policy proposals that exist in this 
country today. And it will save lives. 
I mentioned the shooting in Texas 
because one of the critiques of this pro-
posal often is, well, it wouldn’t have 
stopped the last mass shooting. I don’t 
claim that this proposal nor any other 
proposal to change the Nation’s gun 
laws will have an effect on every single 
shooting, but the data is the data. 
These are the statistics. 
This proposal is the most impactful 
when a State takes it. Universal back-
ground checks save lives, decrease gun 
violence, decrease violent crimes. The 
loss of life, when it is a shooting on the

December 2, 2021 
streets of New Haven, one person being 
shot, that is just as shattering to the 
lives of the people who love that victim 
as is a mass shooting. 
So I am hopeful that the Senate will 
make the decision today to pass this 
bill into law. I understand the chances 
are slim to none that this unanimous 
consent request will be adopted, but I 
am at my wit’s end. I am at my wit’s 
end. I am prepared to use whatever 
means I have as an individual Senator 
to come down here and press this case 
forward. 
I ask at this point, knowing the Sen-
ator from Iowa is on the floor, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of H.R. 8, the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 
2021, which was received from the 
House; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right 
to object, I would like to give some re-
marks. 
I want to start off with a process 
question to all the 100 Senators. 
Obviously, this is an important issue 
with a lot of people. Democrats control 
every committee in this body, and this 
bill is being offered, when it could be 
brought up in the committee under 
regular order because they control the 
agenda of, in this case, the Judiciary 
Committee. So why hasn’t that come 
up? 
Then I would remind people that in 
2013, we actually had a vote on a Grass-
ley-Cruz amendment that got the most 
votes so far of any gun issues. That was 
in, I think, the year 2013. 
Let’s get to the issue that was 
brought up today by the Senator from 
Connecticut. Let me say that we have 
to have real regard for the position he 
takes because of the tragedy that hap-
pened in his State in 2012. Nobody is 
going to justify that. If they did, they 
would be crazy for trying to say that 
something bad like that happened and 
that it is not a crisis for everybody. 
Let me start off by saying in regard 
to what happened in Michigan that the 
senseless tragedy we saw in that State 
should not have happened. The shooter, 
as we have been told, killed four and 
injured others in a shocking act of vio-
lence. I cannot imagine what those 
families of the victims are going 
through because I guess you would 
have to go through it to try to get 
their feeling about it. You see it ex-
pressed on television, but it doesn’t 
make the same impact on the people 
who are listening that it makes on the 
family of the victims. 
Difficult topics require across-the- 
aisle conversations, particularly when 
you have to have 60 votes to get any-
thing done in this body. I would invite 
my colleagues across the aisle to have 
a bipartisan conversation on this topic 
and a lot of related topics to it. 
Violent crime and violence at schools 
are serious problems. I have supported 
legislative efforts to improve the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background 
Check System, which we call NICS. For 
example, I introduced the EAGLES 
Act, a bipartisan bill that would help 
reauthorize the U.S. Secret Service’s 
National Threat Assessment Center, 
where they study targeted violence and 
proactively 
identify 
and 
manage 
threats before they result in tragedies. 
However, in regard to the motion be-
fore us, I have serious concerns with 
the bill raised by the Senator from 
Connecticut. This bill is hostile toward 
lawful gun owners and lawful firearm 
transactions. This will not solve the 
problems that it seeks to solve. 
So-called 
‘‘universal’’ 
background 
checks will not prevent crime and will 
turn otherwise law-abiding citizens 
into criminals. 
I have introduced legislation, along 
with Senators CRUZ and TILLIS, called 
Protecting 
Communities 
and 
Pre-
serving the Second Amendment Act. 
Our bill will be much more effective 
than the underlying bill and has been 
supported by a majority of the Senate 
in the past. 
And I think that is the same thing 
that I was referring to—a vote that got 
a majority but not 60 votes in 2013. 
But the Democrat leadership has 
blocked that approach, which I assume 
that they will do again today. 
This legislation, S. 1775, would reau-
thorize and improve NICS, increase re-
sources for prosecution of gun crime, 
and address mental illness in the 
criminal justice system, which if it had 
been addressed properly in the case of 
the Parkland, FL, shooting, that indi-
vidual who had been identified, I think, 
somewhere between 30 and 40 times as 
having very serious mental issues, if he 
had been identified, he would have been 
in the NICS system and not been able 
to buy that gun. And that is just one 
thing, mental illness being a problem. 
And 
this 
legislation 
would 
also 
strengthen criminal law by including 
straw purchasing and illegal firearms 
trafficking statutes. It does that with-
out burdening any Second Amendment 
rights of Americans. 
In addition, this bill would require a 
commission to study and report to 
Congress the underlying causes and 
triggers for mass shootings. The com-
mission and study proposed could not 
come at a more important time, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation that I will suggest to the Sen-
ate on a UC request. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I object to 
the motion that you have asked UC on. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I know 
the Senator has his own UC request. I 
will just say two things very quickly. I 
am 
not 
surprised, 
but 
still 
dis-
appointed, in the objection. 
I take the Senator’s advice seriously. 
We need 60 votes in order to pass legis-
lation like H.R. 8 before this body, but 
I think, as the Senator knows, with 
Senator DURBIN’s guidance, I have been 
involved in multiple rounds of talks 
with Republican Senators throughout 
the year about trying to find some 
common ground. I think anyone who 
has been part of those talks knows that 
I have been willing to bend; I have been 
willing to compromise. I am not going 
to let the perfect be the enemy of the 
good when it comes to saving lives. 
And if the Senator is making an offer 
to join those talks or to sit down, then 
count me in. 
But so far, a year into maybe the 
most deadly year in my political life-
time with respect to gun violence, I 
haven’t been able to find one Repub-
lican taker for a compromise on the 
issue of background checks. 
And then I will gladly send to the 
Senator the reams of data showing 
that background checks, in fact, do 
make a difference. As I cited, just in 
2020, we see the difference between 
States that have background checks 
and those that don’t. 
I look forward to continuing that 
conversation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 8 AND S. 
1775 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as if 
in legislative session, I would ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 62, which is S. 
1775, the Protecting Communities and 
Preserving the Second Amendment Act 
of 2021; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, let me concede 
that there are some laudable pieces to 
this legislation. It is not new to the 
body. As Senator GRASSLEY mentioned, 
this is something that has received a 
vote. 
But in large part, it is a massive con-
traction of the universal background 
check system rather than what Ameri-
cans support, which is an expansion of 
the background check system, and let 
me give you just two examples. 
In this legislation there would be a 
change in law, such that for individuals 
who are subject to psychiatric confine-
ment, the minute they leave that con-
finement, they get their gun rights re-
stored. That is not the existing law. 
The existing law says that if you are so 
mentally ill that you have had to be in-
patient, you don’t get those gun rights 
restored unless you petition. 
Second, this bill would say that for 
individuals who have been judged men-
tally incompetent—this is a regulatory 
term, not my term. But for individuals

who have been determined mentally in-
competent by a Federal Government 
Agency, they would have their gun 
rights restored. Right now, those indi-
viduals are not allowed to possess guns, 
but they would under this proposal. 
So this amendment, while it has 
some, I think, important pieces to it, 
in large part is a pretty massive con-
traction of the number of background 
checks that would be done in this coun-
try, and for that reason I would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I made the request. 
So there isn’t any objection, so my bill 
passes? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. Ob-
jection is heard. He did object. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I give up the 
floor, I would like to suggest that we 
can start sitting down with the Sen-
ator from Connecticut and a lot of 
other Senators who are interested in 
this issue, both on the Republican side 
and the Democrat side, with the legis-
lation that I have suggested. 
The other thing I would like to com-
ment on, just to clarify, is the Sen-
ator’s statement about the recapture of 
gun rights under our bill: He is right. 
But you have got to look at why those 
Second Amendment rights were taken 
away in the first place, and I think it 
is the same principle that applies to 
people that have gone through the So-
cial Security system and the people 
that have gone through the VA system. 
It is as simple as a little thing, that 
you have got to have a third party han-
dle your finances for your family or 
whatever finances you have. You have 
to have a third party to do it. That 
name gets put in the NICS system, and 
it shouldn’t be there just because you 
can’t handle your finances. That has 
got nothing to do with that you ought 
to be denied your Second Amendment 
rights. 
And so our legislation provides a 
process to make sure that the due proc-
ess of the Second Amendment rights 
that have been denied can be recap-
tured, so they can have the Bill of 
Rights as was intended. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
wish I could end this exchange on a 
hopeful note. I have come here so many 
times wishing that an exchange like 
this one could lead to progress. And we 
have offered again and again and 
again—the Senator from Connecticut 
on background checks, myself on red 
flag or emergency risk orders, on 
Ethan’s Law with safe storage, on a 
myriad of proposals—to sit down with 
our colleagues and engage in the kind 
of constructive and positive dialogue 
that Senator GRASSLEY has suggested, 
and they have yielded nothing. And the 
reason they have yielded nothing is es-
sentially that, unfortunately, our Re-
publican colleagues remain in the grip 
of a lobby—the gun lobby—which is 
waning in its impact across the coun-
try but still maintains its grip in this 
Chamber. 
That is the grip we need to break. 
That is the grip that will be broken 
through the democratic process if the 
American people have their way. And 
the American people are changing in 
their view. 
In fact, there is now a political move-
ment. It is composed of the young peo-
ple—March for Our Lives—who suffered 
in Parkland, FL, when they saw the 
same kind of shooting and suffered the 
same kind of trauma that those stu-
dents did in Oakland County, MI. 
And again and again and again, this 
tragedy has been repeated in schools 
across our country. We are here again 
with grief and sorrow for the lives 
taken by gun violence—needlessly and 
violently. 
Four young people—Madisyn Bald-
win, 17; Justin Shilling, 17; Hana St. 
Juliana, 14; Tate Myre, 16—were shot 
multiple times, as my colleague from 
Connecticut has described it in that 
video, among many others trying to es-
cape. 
Six other students and a teacher 
were injured, and their community is 
reeling from this horror—a horror of 
blood and flesh and lives cut short for-
ever. 
And their loved ones have joined a 
club, as it has been called—a club no-
body wants to join. Nobody wants to be 
admitted. 
In just 12 days, just 12 days from now, 
it will be the ninth anniversary of a 
tragedy whose survivors joined that 
club—the families of the Sandy Hook 
children—20 beautiful, innocent chil-
dren and 6 dedicated, courageous edu-
cators at Sandy Hook Elementary 
School in Newtown, CT. 
And whenever I talk about this sub-
ject in this Chamber, I see them in the 
Gallery. I see them in the Gallery on 
the day that we failed. We failed by 
just a handful of votes to reach the 60 
that we needed to pass a background 
check proposal. And one of them shout-
ed ‘‘shame.’’ ‘‘Shame.’’ And it was 
shameful and disgraceful that we failed 
to act on that day. 
Think of how many lives we could 
have saved. You know, in this body, we 
talk endlessly, and sometimes we act 
in a way that can affect real lives and 
real people. We could have saved real 
lives and real people on that day—not 
all the lives lost to gun violence, the 
tens of thousands who have perished 
since then, but some of them. 
‘‘When you save one life, you save 
the world’’ is an adage in my faith. We 
had it within our grasp to save lives 
and to help save the world, but we 
failed then, and, again today, we failed, 
even with the impetus of that horror in 
our minds and before us played again 
and again. 
And, for me, the voices of those sur-
vivors resonate. Their faces are forever 
with me, as they will be for all who 
knew the survivors of the Oakland, MI, 
tragedy. 
They have become friends. They have 
become almost members of my family, 
and they relive their own tragedy when 
they see what happened in these shoot-
ings. 
And the trauma affects not just the 
children in that school on Tuesday; it 
affects children everywhere. 
Somebody said to me the other day: 
Do you know the three best words in 
the 
English 
language 
these 
days? 
‘‘Back to normal.’’ 
We want to go back to normal. After 
a year and a half of the pandemic, we 
want to go back to normal, put kids 
back in school, put teachers back in 
the classroom—back to normal. 
We are back to normal in gun vio-
lence. In fact, we are worse than nor-
mal. We are back to normal with 
school shootings because kids are back 
in school, but the rate of gun violence 
has, if anything, explosively increased. 
This normal cannot be normalized. It 
cannot be made the new normal. The 
finality of evil cannot be taken for 
granted. 
The shame that that vote, 9 years 
ago, brought to this body is a stain 
that will forever haunt us and haunts 
us evermore when we fail, as we did 
today, to provide real action. And 
there isn’t any panacea. My colleague 
from Connecticut is absolutely right. 
No single proposal is a solution. 
And there are others that we have ad-
vanced and tried to make it a matter of 
bipartisan support. Senator GRAHAM 
and I have worked on a red flag or 
emergency risk protection order stat-
ute that separates people from guns 
when they are dangerous to themselves 
or others, separates them when they 
are under a protective order and they 
buy those guns, or when a family mem-
ber knows they are about to commit or 
take their own lives, not to mention 
other people’s lives. More than half of 
all the gun deaths in this country are 
suicides. We can save those lives. 
A large number of these deaths occur 
when children are playing with guns in 
their own homes because the guns have 
been unsafely stored. Ethan Song was 
killed in Connecticut because a parent 
failed to safely store a gun. Ethan’s 
Law, requiring safe storage, would save 
lives. 
Holding manufacturers accountable 
and depriving them of sweetheart deals 
that led to PLCAA—giving them im-
munity 
from 
any 
legal 
account-
ability—reversing 
that 
immunity 
would help to save lives in repealing 
PLCAA. There is more than one pro-
posal that we need to seriously con-
sider if we are going to have the kind 
of dialogue that my colleague Senator 
GRASSLEY suggested. 
But the simple fact is, the House of 
Representatives did its job back in 
March when it passed that bipartisan 
legislation 
to 
expand 
background 
checks. 
We are trying to do our job today, 
seeking unanimous consent from our 
colleagues to move forward on H.R. 8, 
and there is no rational explanation—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8886 
December 2, 2021 
none—when the vast majority of Amer-
ican people, gun owners as well as NRA 
members, all backgrounds, all walks of 
life, all geographic areas, all demo-
graphic areas, support this measure. 
So back to normal—we are back to 
normal. We cannot tolerate this nor-
mal. And as we approach that ninth an-
niversary of the Sandy Hook Elemen-
tary School shooting—and I recall that 
bleak day in December when we gath-
ered at a firehouse with parents who 
were waiting to find out—waiting to 
know whether their children were still 
alive. 
No matter what the ages of our chil-
dren—I have four—we can relive that 
moment in our own minds, in our own 
hearts, and we can see in this Gallery 
those parents who came to speak truth 
to us, speak truth to power, and who 
will call us to account. The American 
people should call us to account for our 
failure to act today, our complicity in 
those 
deaths. 
This 
Congress 
is 
complicit. The Members who vote 
against these measures are complicit 
in the tragedies that follow. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of my Connecticut colleagues 
in their effort to pass the bipartisan 
background check bill, H.R. 8. 
I want to thank my friends Senator 
MURPHY and Senator BLUMENTHAL for 
their leadership on this issue. 
I am sure, as Senator BLUMENTHAL 
just recounted, that tragic experience 
at Sandy Hook Elementary School 9 
years ago is still fresh in their minds 
and motivates them to stand up, time 
and again, and to speak out on behalf 
of the families who lost their children 
and those wonderful educators and ad-
ministrators who gave their lives that 
day. 
What will it take? Is there a crime 
involving guns in America so horrific 
that finally we will say enough? 
Other countries have. Australia did. 
They had a terrible shooting. They 
came to the conclusion that this was 
just unacceptable in their nation. They 
wouldn’t let it become normal. Some 
States have done that. Connecticut did 
after Sandy Hook. They said our State 
will be different. We are not going to 
stand just idly by. 
But when it comes here to Wash-
ington in this national legislature, in 
this Senate, it appears there is nothing 
sufficiently awful, so specifically out-
rageous that it will move us to act. 
This last week, it was Oakland Coun-
ty, MI, Oxford High School. Four chil-
dren got up in the morning, blurry- 
eyed, brushed their teeth, grabbed 
their lunches, headed off to school— 
and never came home. That was the re-
ality of this. 
Senator MURPHY has said those other 
students, lucky enough to survive, will 
never forget that day as long as they 
live. They will be telling their grand-
children about the day they had to dive 
out of a window to escape this gunman 
who was going through their school. 
I have always thought, of the most 
terrible gun crimes that have hap-
pened—and there have been so many, 
so many—Sandy Hook is the worst. I 
can’t imagine a classroom of 20 first 
graders and the teachers being gunned 
down at their desks. Oh, my God. 
For every parent and every grand-
parent, it is the worst nightmare in the 
world, and it happened there—20 of 
them. Certainly, many of us believed 
that would be the moment that Amer-
ica would come to its senses and say: 
Let’s do something. If we can’t do ev-
erything, let’s do something to show 
we care. But as a national legislature, 
we failed. 
And the proposal that we brought to 
the floor that was objected to today is 
the most basic thing in the world. OK. 
You have second amendment rights, 
unless—unless—you have given those 
up by committing a felony crime and 
being convicted of it, unless you were 
so 
mentally 
unstable 
that 
you 
shouldn’t own a gun. That is basically 
it. That is all we said. Are those unrea-
sonable? I think not. Eighty-four per-
cent of Americans happen to believe 
that is a pretty sensible thing to do—84 
percent. But when it comes to the U.S. 
Senate, we can’t get 51 percent to vote 
that way—at least not yet. 
So I thank my colleagues Senator 
MURPHY and Senator BLUMENTHAL for 
reminding us of the terrible tragedy in 
their lives and in their State just 9 
years ago. But I will tell you that as 
horrible as Sandy Hook was, 900 people 
have died by gunfire in Cook County, 
IL, which I represent, just this year, 
and 40,000 Americans lost their lives to 
guns last year. We can’t do anything 
about that. They are gone. 
But what about tomorrow’s victims? 
What about next week’s victims? What 
about the next high school? We can do 
something about that, and this bill 
would pass today if Republican Sen-
ators would allow it. 
Let’s be very candid about this. This 
is a partisan issue. It shouldn’t be. 
Those gunmen—I don’t think anyone 
reports their political status, and cer-
tainly the victims are not identified 
that way. But in this Chamber, it is an 
article of faith, political faith, that Re-
publicans won’t touch anything related 
to gun safety—anything. 
The bill that was objected to, pro-
posed by Senator GRASSLEY, the pro-
tecting communities bill—first, let me 
say CHUCK GRASSLEY is my friend. I 
mean it. I don’t just say that as polit-
ical, idle talk. He is my ranking mem-
ber on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. We disagree on a lot of things. 
We sure do agree on a lot of things too. 
The bill that he described is a step in 
the wrong direction, as was mentioned 
by Senator MURPHY. That bill doesn’t 
fix the gaping holes in the background 
check system. It makes them worse. To 
say that people who have been involun-
tarily committed to a psychiatric hos-
pital can leave that hospital, walk out 
the door, and buy a gun, that doesn’t 
even make sense. 
You would certainly want to ask 
someone, some medical expert, what is 
their state of mind? Have they fully re-
covered? Are they ready? Can they 
make a basic decision that we can 
trust? That is not too much to ask for 
those who are involuntarily committed 
to a psychiatric hospital. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Grassley 
bill, 
which we objected to, would automati-
cally restore a person’s right to buy a 
gun the minute they walked out of the 
hospital. The bill also wipes away the 
NICS background check system for the 
records of—listen—175,000 people in 
this country who have been found, in 
the words of the statute, ‘‘mentally in-
competent.’’ This bill would allow 
them—permit them to buy guns imme-
diately. 
How can that make any sense at all? 
Surely, the definition may not be the 
best, but let’s work on that instead of 
just saying, on a blanket basis, go out 
and buy a gun if you want to. 
The bill also weakens gun laws on 
the books. The bill would allow gun 
dealers to sell handguns directly to 
people from other States. How does 
that make us safer? And it would bar 
the ATF from requiring gun dealers to 
submit reports of multiple purchases of 
long guns—a key indicator of gun traf-
ficking in many border States. 
We are a long way from where we 
should be, but Senator GRASSLEY has 
challenged me as chairman of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee to hold a 
hearing, mark up the bill. 
I accept the challenge. We may not 
get to first base on this, but we are not 
going to stay in the stands and in the 
bleachers as kids are being gunned 
down at Oxford High School, and we 
are ‘‘celebrating’’—if that is the word— 
all of the gun deaths of the past with 
anniversaries that bring back bitter 
memories and tragic occurrences. 
So, yes, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee will have a hearing. We are 
going to move forward as best we can. 
Maybe there is common ground out 
there. I pray, for the victims and their 
families—I pray that there is. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Ohio. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the Senate floor today to talk, 
once again, about the so-called Build 
Back Better legislation that the Demo-
crats are trying to force through this 
system on a purely partisan basis 
under what is called reconciliation. 
I strongly believe that this massive 
tax-and-spend bill is the wrong way to 
go. I think it is irresponsible, particu-
larly at a time of high inflation, uncer-
tain economic growth—driven a lot by 
the 
uncertainties 
around 
the 
new 
COVID concerns—and record levels of 
debt. 
This is the ninth consecutive week 
that the Senate has been in session 
that I have come to the Senate floor to 
talk about specific reasons I believe 
the Build Back Better legislation is a 
bad deal for America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8887 
December 2, 2021 
As we have talked about before, this 
massive new spending bill represents 
the largest amount of spending of any 
legislation ever passed by the U.S. Con-
gress. Now, the official score is some-
thing like $1.7 trillion. You could argue 
that the one that passed in March, the 
$1.9 trillion, was the largest one, and 
that this is the second largest one. 
In fact, when you look at what is in 
it, a lot of the spending is, in effect, 
camouflaged, as has been said by the 
folks at Penn Wharton, who analyzed 
this. When you take into account the 
programs that are relatively popular 
and unlikely ever to be ended—like the 
child tax credit—or that are likely to 
continue, they are sunsetted in this 
legislation. 
If they weren’t sunsetted, the cost of 
the bill would go from about $1.75 tril-
lion to about $4.5 trillion. One analysis 
from the Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget has it a little higher 
than that, but let’s say it is $4.5 tril-
lion. That would be, by far, the largest 
piece of legislation that would have 
ever passed the U.S. Congress. 
Much of that spending is what is 
called stimulus spending—adding to 
the demand side of the economy, add-
ing to inflation. Remember, inflation is 
demand chasing supply. If there is not 
enough supply and there is more de-
mand, you have inflation. That is what 
many of us predicted would happen 
with the $1.9 trillion legislation. Unfor-
tunately, that is exactly what hap-
pened. 
So, once again, at a time of dev-
astating high inflation already, record 
debt, and so much uncertainty on 
COVID and the possible need for more 
Federal resources there with regard to 
COVID, 
massive 
new 
spending—it 
seems to me right now—is the wrong 
thing to do. 
On the revenue side, the massive tax 
increases are also irresponsible, in my 
view, and not well thought out. 
Today, I would like to focus on one 
new tax increase proposal in par-
ticular, and this is the Democrats’ plan 
to propose a new 15-percent minimum 
tax on the domestic side. They call it 
the minimum book tax. It is not a tax 
on books; it is a tax on companies and 
on workers and on pensions, which we 
will talk about, based on the financial 
statement. It is not based on income as 
we traditionally think about it or as 
the Tax Code traditionally defines it, 
but it relies on so-called book value, 
and 
it 
has 
several 
negative 
con-
sequences that I want to talk about 
today. 
The new book tax, if it were to be put 
into effect, would drive inflation even 
higher. It would discourage investment 
in key sectors of the economy, and it 
would jeopardize the state of busi-
nesses that provide pension funds for 
their employees. 
The book tax proposal is, essentially, 
a new corporate alternative tax. But, 
again, it taxes the adjusted financial 
statement income of a large corpora-
tion, not its IRS tax analysis; and that 
is the income that might be reported 
to, let’s say, the SEC through a Form 
10–K. 
This makes it very different than the 
existing corporate income tax, which is 
determined based on the income that 
these companies report to the IRS. Be-
cause these two taxes are calculated 
using very different base amounts, the 
15-percent book tax can end up being a 
lot larger for companies than the 21- 
percent income tax. 
The line that you will likely hear 
from some of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle is that this tax 
is designed to make big companies pay 
their fair share of taxes because it only 
applies to companies with a 3-year av-
erage adjusted book income of more 
than $1 billion, but studies from the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Of-
fice, the Tax Foundation, and more 
show that it is actually the workers 
who bear the brunt of these types of 
taxes in the form of lower wages, lower 
benefits, lost jobs, and higher prices. I 
am also hearing about a number of spe-
cific 
unintended, 
perhaps, 
con-
sequences, and I am certain there will 
be others as well. 
Let’s start with its effect on workers’ 
retirements. Under this proposal, a 
qualifying company ends up paying a 
new tax on certain investment gains, 
potentially due to just a change in in-
terest rates, in their employees’ pen-
sion funds. So this is a new tax. Right 
now, if the pension fund has an income 
gain, that would not be taxed, but 
under this proposal, it would be—under 
the book tax proposal. So it is basi-
cally a tax on the pensions. 
First, these gains shouldn’t result in 
a tax to the company at all. Companies 
do not have access to these pension in-
vestments. They sit in a segregated ac-
count. Companies can’t touch them nor 
should they be able to touch them. Ob-
viously, they make money for the re-
tirement accounts of the employees. 
That is the whole idea. For good rea-
son, pension funds should be invested, 
and they should grow over time be-
cause 
it 
benefits 
the 
workers 
to 
strengthen their retirement security. 
Second, companies could be forced to 
pay more in taxes on the pension gains 
than the company makes in actual 
profits. 
Let’s take an established company, 
and I can tell you some of them have 
contacted us with specific examples of 
this, but they tend to be companies 
that are pretty well established be-
cause they have pretty big pension 
plans. 
If you have an established company 
with a large pension plan, let’s say 
that company makes a profit of 100 
million bucks in a year. They could see 
their long-running pension fund gain a 
lot more than that—say, $2 billion— 
over that same period. 
So, under this tax plan, that com-
pany would have to pay a 15-percent 
tax on that $2 billion in pension in-
come, or about $300 million on top of 
any normal income taxes. That busi-
ness then has to make a tough choice 
because, remember, the business has 
only made $100 billion in profit, and 
you have a tax bill of $300 million be-
cause of your pension income. 
Are you going to go bankrupt? Are 
you going to take out loans to pay 
these taxes? 
This is money that would otherwise 
be invested in people, in plants, equip-
ment, in our economy. Instead, it is 
going toward paying a potentially 
large tax that is entirely counter-
productive. 
Third, of course, is that it discour-
ages companies from investing in their 
workers’ retirements. Having more in-
vested in pension plans is good for 
workers. I think we should encourage 
employers to do the right thing, and 
that is to have a defined benefit plan. 
There are fewer of them these days. Of 
those that are left, we don’t want to 
drive employers out of those, in my 
view. 
By the way, that is the view of al-
most all of my colleagues, I think, on 
the other side of the aisle and certainly 
a lot of union members who have these 
pensions. Let’s not forget that this tax 
could threaten the retirement of tens 
of thousands of union and nonunion 
workers alike. 
But this tax proposal doesn’t just 
jeopardize pensions; it could have a sig-
nificant negative impact on how indus-
tries, particularly manufacturers, in-
vest in growing their operations. Ac-
cording to data from the nonpartisan 
Joint Committee on Taxation, the 
manufacturing sector leads all other 
sectors in the economy when it comes 
to the use of what is called bonus de-
preciation. That is where you get to 
have an immediate writeoff if you ex-
pand, again, plant or equipment. 
That is something that was part of 
the 2017 tax legislation. It has been 
very helpful to help grow the economy, 
very important to retailers, very im-
portant to hospitality, and very impor-
tant, of course, to manufacturers, who 
lead the way in terms of taking this de-
duction. It allows them to quickly and 
affordably invest in equipment, in new 
machinery, leading to higher produc-
tivity, leading to more jobs—what 
economists think is the most impor-
tant thing we can do right now in our 
economy, which is to grow the supply 
side of our economy. 
Under this new book tax the Demo-
crats are proposing, that deduction 
would not be able to be paid, as it is 
now, immediately as bonus deprecia-
tion but, rather, it would have to be 
paid over a longer period of time, mak-
ing these critical investments a lot less 
likely and leading to fewer new hires 
and lower productivity. 
By the way, less investment in cap-
ital assets, of course, puts more pres-
sure on inflation because it increases 
on the demand side of the economy if 
you don’t do it. If you do it, it would 
increase on the supply side. So you 
want to encourage investments in cap-
ital assets. That is good because it 
helps in terms of the supply side.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8888 
December 2, 2021 
So this bill has stimulus spending, as 
we talked about, on the spending side, 
and more demand and lower invest-
ment is exactly the opposite of what 
we ought to be doing in terms of coun-
tering inflation. 
Taking a broader view, both of these 
immediate negative impacts on the 
economy and workers—the taxes on 
pension funds and less financial incen-
tive for investment—are going to lead 
to higher prices for consumers, which 
also increases inflation. 
It is even worse. From what I am 
hearing, some of the biggest sponsors 
of pension plans are logistics and deliv-
ery companies. I hope my colleagues 
are talking to these same companies 
that are reaching out to talk to us. To 
pay for these additional costs, particu-
larly the pension costs, they have told 
us they are likely going to have to in-
crease costs, reduce customer services, 
and suspend investment in new tech-
nology. These are logistics companies. 
At a time when many Americans are 
already experiencing inflation and sup-
ply chain bottlenecks, this is exactly 
the wrong prescription. 
The book tax proposal is just one of 
a lot of policies in this reconciliation 
bill that I think would be bad for the 
economy and bad for workers. Maybe 
these 
specific 
problems 
we 
talked 
about today were just overlooked in 
the rush to produce a bill without 
going through any of the normal com-
mittee processes, including the Fi-
nance Committee, which hasn’t looked 
at 
this—those 
issues 
would 
have 
emerged, I am sure, had the Ways and 
Means Committee and the Finance 
Committee had the opportunity to re-
view it and to analyze it—or maybe the 
plan is to just overwhelm the American 
people with so many dramatic changes 
to our Tax Code that they won’t notice 
how irresponsible any single one might 
be. Whatever the case, it is clear that 
this book tax has not been properly 
vetted. 
It is time for Congress to slow down 
this process so that we can properly 
understand the consequences of these 
policies on the American people. These 
massive tax-and-spend proposals are 
bad for the economy, certainly bad for 
inflation, bad for business, and most 
importantly, bad for workers and their 
jobs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this is al-
ways a very busy time of the year if we 
are still here, and it has been a long 
time since the Congress wasn’t here in 
the first of December. There have been 
years within the last couple of decades 
where we actually got our work done 
fairly close to the time that the spend-
ing year started. We are not close to 
doing that now. In fact, the apparent 
best-case scenario is that we will need 
to extend this year’s spending—the 
spending that ended on September 30— 
through most of the month of February 
before we really can get down to the 
work that you and I would like to see 
happen, as we serve on the Appropria-
tions Committee. 
We are here a lot of times in Decem-
ber, but we are seldom here in Decem-
ber without having made a real start 
on the work that has to be done. In-
stead of the work that has to be done, 
we seem to be down to the work that 
our friends on the other side really 
want to do. Of course, that means the 
trillions of dollars of spending beyond 
what we would normally spend. 
That is being described by people as 
transformative, as once-in-a-century, 
as FDR-like. The one thing it is for 
sure is it is 100 percent partisan. No-
body expects a single Member of the 
Senate on the Republican side to vote 
for this reckless tax-and-spending bill. 
You can tell, as you listen to the de-
scription of the bill, that there is be-
ginning to be more and more worry 
about what the American people are 
thinking that this bill might really 
wind up doing to their families and to 
the country. When they hear that it is 
going to be transformative, when they 
hear that the entire economy will be 
different and people’s problems will 
change in dramatic ways, people really 
begin to have to wonder how that hap-
pens, particularly when we hear that 
this won’t cost anything. 
Well, of course it is going to cost 
something. You can say all you want 
to, that the cost is zero, but the cost 
can’t possibly be zero of something 
that is going to transform the economy 
and solve people’s problems. Somebody 
is going to have to pay for that. 
At one time, it appeared that, well, 
maybe we will just raise every bit of 
those extra spending dollars on new tax 
dollars. That hasn’t happened yet in 
any bill that has been brought forward. 
In fact, the bill that the Senate is 
going to receive from the House has an 
actual deficit, even by the Congres-
sional Budget Office standards, of 
about $350 billion. 
In 2019, we almost decided that we 
couldn’t move forward on the debt ceil-
ing because the Speaker of the House 
said: We are not going to help on the 
debt ceiling unless there is another $19 
billion of domestic spending. 
This was 2019. We spent weeks fight-
ing about whether we would spend an-
other $19 billion. The Secretary of the 
Treasury, 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, 
was 
down here about once or twice every 
week in the negotiations that it would 
take to decide if we are going to spend 
$19 billion. Now we are talking about a 
$350 billion addition to the national 
debt, and that is even if you accept all 
the gimmicks in the bill. 
There are other negative effects as 
well. One of those big negative effects 
will be, of course, the impact of infla-
tion on families. We are already seeing 
the impact of the big—the spending bill 
in March, the $1.9 trillion of spending 
that out of nowhere came into the 
economy, totally unpaid for, totally 
partisan. 
Last year, we had five bipartisan 
bills that both sides worked hard to do 
what we needed to to respond to 
COVID, to try to stabilize the econ-
omy. This year, we started off the year 
in March with an almost $2 trillion to-
tally partisan bill, and that partisan 
bill is beginning to have the kinds of 
effects you would expect it would have. 
Costs are going up. There is more 
money out there, and mostly there is 
just money that is just made up out of 
thin air. It is borrowed, where the gov-
ernment is borrowing from itself. We 
are issuing bonds and buying the bonds 
at the Fed and then sending money to 
people. They are spending that money, 
and, of course, that has an impact on 
costs. 
Then there are energy policies that 
have an impact on costs as well—the 
immediate decision to not move for-
ward with a significant energy pipeline 
that was being built; the immediate de-
cision to do what we could to reduce 
the domestic production of energy. 
That has had exactly the results you 
would expect it to have, just like put-
ting this money into the economy has 
had a result. So everything from home 
heating costs, which are estimated to 
go up as much as 50 percent this year if 
the weather is no worse than last year, 
to filling up your gas tank—we have a 
chance of setting a new personal record 
every time you pull up to the gas tank 
and wonder how much money you can 
put in that empty gas tank today—to 
buying groceries, to even getting peo-
ple together for the holidays. 
Independent analysts of the big tax- 
and-spending spree say that the num-
ber isn’t $1.7 trillion, but it is about 
three times that, about $4.8 trillion. 
Now, how could you go from 1.7 to 4.8 
just like that? You do it by assuming, 
as our friends who are sponsors of the 
bill do, that the spending in the bill 
will actually be spent over the entire 10 
years. 
There is one program where families 
with kids at home get a check every 
month from the government. That pro-
gram costs about $450 billion a year, 
and it is in the bill for 1 year. Well, no-
body on the other side believes it is 
going to be in the bill for 1 year, and 
nobody voting against the bill is at all 
certain that it is going to be there for 
1 year. Most of the analysts say, no, 
that is going to be there for not 1 year 
but all 10 years. So you add another 
$450 billion times nine, and suddenly 
you have added trillions more in spend-
ing to the bill. 
There are other programs that last 2 
years, and some programs last 4 years. 
Almost none of the programs that are 
to be paid for in 10 years—and even 
with a $350 billion deficit—almost none 
of the programs to be paid for in 10 
years last 10 years. They are just in 
there to get the program started, to 
get people convinced that they really 
need the government to do something 
for them that the government hasn’t 
done before, and then see if we can ex-
tend that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8889 
December 2, 2021 
As I mentioned, back in March, we 
had already done this once with a to-
tally partisan $1.9 trillion spending 
bill. What happened after March? We 
got inflation to a 30-year high in the 
August numbers and consumer con-
fidence to a 10-year low. You have to 
work pretty hard to get inflation at a 
30-year high and consumer confidence 
at a 10-year low, but that is what hap-
pens when you put $1.9 trillion into the 
economy that wouldn’t have been there 
otherwise. 
So what would happen if you put $4.8 
trillion 
into 
the 
economy 
that 
wouldn’t be there otherwise? The peo-
ple who are most impacted by the re-
sults of that are the very people the 
bill purportedly is going to help, is de-
signed to help. We are going to solve 
all of your problems. Well, first of all, 
the government is not going to get 
that done. We are going to solve Amer-
icans’ everyday problems, but if you do 
that by raising their costs higher than 
their pay can go up, you haven’t done 
anybody a favor. 
President Biden campaigned on a re-
turn to normal, but he is governing on 
what his self-described allies say is 
radical change. Well, those two things 
seem to me to be in pretty big conflict. 
You can’t have ‘‘return to normal’’ and 
‘‘radical change’’ at the same time. 
There was no mandate in the last 
election. The Senate is as evenly di-
vided as it could possibly be—50–50. In 
the House, Democrats have the closest 
margin that they have had in 170 years 
and one of the closest margins that 
anybody has had in decades. 
Americans want their elected rep-
resentatives to stop selling every crisis 
as an opportunity to impose another 
one-sided view of how the country 
needs to move forward. 
You hear and I hear at home and 
even from the press: When is the Con-
gress going to work together? Well, we 
worked together last year to do five 
bills to respond to the COVID and eco-
nomic crisis, and we did that together. 
That was a pretty good model. Frank-
ly, I think it was the model that the 
American people were thinking about 
when they voted for this closely di-
vided Congress and in a fairly closely 
divided Presidential race at the conclu-
sion of the election. 
Families need real solutions to the 
challenges they face. Reckless tax and 
spending, driving inflation, sending gas 
prices to alltime highs and home heat-
ing prices to alltime highs and increas-
ing the cost at the grocery store—if 
there are things to buy at the grocery 
store—by 15 or 20 percent surely, isn’t 
what we want to pass on to our chil-
dren, our grandchildren, our people, 
hard-working families out there today 
trying to make things happen and 
make things better for their families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
TRIBUTE TO ASHLEY HARRINGTON 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want 
to spend a quick moment saying a fond 
thank-you and farewell to a staff mem-
ber of mine who is leaving. 
My deep gratitude to Ashley Har-
rington, who is off to great adventures. 
Our sadness at her leaving is matched 
only by our excitement for her as she 
starts her next chapter. 
Thank you for your dedication, your 
humor, your invaluable skills. We are 
going to miss you throughout our en-
tire office. 
NOMINATION OF RACHAEL S. ROLLINS 
Mr. President, I come here today to 
speak in support of Suffolk County Dis-
trict Attorney Rachael Rollins, nomi-
nee to serve as U.S. attorney for the 
District of Massachusetts. 
The fact that I and my Senate part-
ner, Senator WARREN, have to come to 
the floor at all in support of this quali-
fied, respected, effective law enforce-
ment official is a testimony to the un-
precedented partisanship of my Repub-
lican colleagues. It is truly outrageous. 
Before I share more about District 
Attorney Rollins’ record of accomplish-
ment—a record that my Republican 
colleagues have intentionally distorted 
and mischaracterized—I want to ex-
plain how politically partisan this U.S. 
attorney nomination process has be-
come. 
In September, the Judiciary Com-
mittee held a rollcall vote on Rachael 
Rollins’ nomination to serve as U.S. at-
torney for the District of Massachu-
setts. She was voted out of committee 
on an 11-to-11 vote. All Democrats 
voted aye; all Republicans opposed the 
nomination. 
With this vote, Judiciary Committee 
Republicans eviscerated a three-decade 
precedent of voice votes for U.S. attor-
ney nominees for all 50 States—every 
single time. The committee had last 
held a rollcall vote on a U.S. attorney 
nominee in 1993. And based on a review 
of available materials, before the 117th 
Congress, the Judiciary Committee had 
only ever held a rollcall vote on three 
U.S. attorney nominees: in 1993, 1982, 
and 1975. 
The Senate last required cloture on a 
U.S. attorney nominee in 1993 but ulti-
mately confirmed that nominee by 
voice vote. And—listen to this—the 
Senate last held a rollcall vote on the 
floor of the Senate on a U.S. attorney 
nominee in 1975. We have held more im-
peachment votes on the floor of the 
Senate than votes on U.S. attorney 
nominees since 1975. 
This obstruction of District Attorney 
Rollins’ nomination is unwarranted, 
unfounded, and unprecedented. Let me 
underscore that last point. During the 
Trump administration, Judiciary Com-
mittee Democrats agreed to voice vote 
all 85 U.S. attorney nominees who 
came before them, despite disagree-
ments with multiple nominees’ records 
and ideology. All 85 of those U.S. attor-
neys in the Trump era were processed 
by the Judiciary Committee and re-
ceived a voice vote with no recorded 
opposition. And the Senate, likewise, 
confirmed all 85 by unanimous consent 
on the Senate floor during the Donald 
Trump era. 
The opposition to Rachael Rollins is 
nothing more than a deeply partisan 
ploy to score political points at the ex-
pense of the record of a respected, 
qualified, courageous, Black, female, 
progressive district attorney. It is of-
fensive, and it is not in service to pub-
lic safety—in Massachusetts or across 
our Nation. 
Let me tell you about District Attor-
ney Rachael Rollins and why her 
record has garnered supported from all 
corners of the law enforcement com-
munity in Massachusetts and New Eng-
land and from Republicans and Demo-
crats alike. 
District Attorney Rollins has public 
safety in her blood. Her father, a sec-
ond-generation Irish American, fought 
in the Vietnam war and later worked 
as a corrections officer. Her maternal 
grandparents are from Barbados, and 
her mother is a first-generation Amer-
ican. 
She represents the very best of what 
this country is all about: opportunity, 
public service, and plain old hard work. 
As the district attorney for the coun-
ty 
encompassing 
Boston 
and 
sur-
rounding cities, District Attorney Rol-
lins has a demonstrated record of suc-
cess as a prosecutor. She leads an office 
of 300 employees, including more than 
150 lawyers who handle 25,000 new 
criminal case filings and 1,000 criminal 
investigations annually. She leads a 
very busy office efficiently and effec-
tively. 
On the most serious crimes, her 
record is unassailable. In 2019, Rollins’ 
first full year in office, the homicide 
unit’s number of completed trials in-
creased by 21 percent. Boston homi-
cides declined by 31 percent in 2019, 
making it the lowest number in dec-
ades. 
And she aggressively prosecutes drug 
trafficking. Between January 1, 2021, 
and October 12, 2021, just this year, the 
Suffolk County DA’s office has pros-
ecuted 147 trafficking cases. Of those 
cases, 98 involved charges of traf-
ficking fentanyl, accounting for 67 per-
cent of total drug trafficking prosecu-
tions. District Attorney Rollins has 
prosecuted more drug traffickers than 
her predecessor. 
I have personally met with and 
talked with District Attorney Rollins 
on multiple occasions about the opioid 
epidemic 
that 
is 
being 
fueled 
by 
fentanyl. There is no one more dedi-
cated to ending that scourge than she 
is. She is committed to using the DA’s 
office to hold fentanyl drug traffickers 
fully 
accountable, 
and 
her 
record 
proves that. 
Her record on investigations is equal-
ly remarkable. In 2020, the homicide 
unit expanded its investigations by 44 
percent. The major felony unit in-
creased its by 22 percent, the human 
trafficking and exploitation unit by 19 
percent, and the special prosecutions 
unit by 33 percent. Under District At-
torney Rollins’ leadership, her office is 
as active as it has ever been in going 
after the most serious crimes in Suf-
folk County.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8890 
December 2, 2021 
But her excellence doesn’t end there. 
District Attorney Rollins has dem-
onstrated a commitment to working 
with law enforcement to advance com-
munity safety and build trust between 
the community and law enforcement 
officers. She and her office are a true 
partner for colleagues, and it is re-
flected in the coordination that they 
prioritize. 
In June of 2020, she organized a key 
discussion with law enforcement execu-
tives from Greater Boston to have an 
open dialogue about policing practices 
in light of the racial reckoning that 
followed the murder of George Floyd. 
With her leadership, District Attorney 
Rollins and the law enforcement execu-
tives signed a letter committing to 
change and ensuring that there would 
be open communication on that topic. 
District Attorney Rollins recognized 
the historic moment law enforcement 
was confronting in the wake of the 
Floyd murder, and she actively reached 
out to her law enforcement partners to 
show a united front in their commit-
ment to justice. Rachael Rollins is 
proof that you can enforce laws and 
promote justice and that the commu-
nity wants both. 
As a result of this leadership, the 
Suffolk County law enforcement execu-
tives wrote a letter in support of her 
nomination to serve as U.S. attorney 
for the District of Massachusetts. In 
that letter, they highlighted the re-
spect she has for the work they do to 
keep communities safe. 
And in the wake of two incidents of 
hate against the Jewish community 
that occurred this summer, District 
Attorney Rollins led the response, 
using the resources of her office to in-
vestigate the incidents transparently 
and fully. She personally ensured that 
there would be a focus on this issue. 
She attended vigils for both events to 
ensure that there would be a commit-
ment that was heard that the safety of 
the communities that had been di-
rectly impacted would be protected. 
In a letter from the Anti-Defamation 
League of New England, it said of her 
actions: In the aftermath of the inci-
dents 
. . . 
she 
demonstrated 
true 
allyship and solidarity with the af-
fected communities. The importance of 
her commitment to this ideal cannot 
be overstated. 
Rachael Rollins is a prosecutor at 
her core, but she also believes in re-
storative justice and is one of Massa-
chusetts’ greatest advocates for vic-
tims of crime. The local organizations 
that advocate for the rights of victims 
and their families—including Mothers 
for Justice & Equality, the Children’s 
Advocacy Center of Suffolk County, 
the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center, 
and the Boston Medical Center’s Vio-
lence 
Intervention 
Advocacy 
Pro-
gram—all wrote letters in support of 
Rollins’ nomination. 
Mothers for Justice wrote that Dis-
trict Attorney Rollins’ ‘‘determination 
to bring [to justice] those who commit 
crimes against community is needed at 
the highest levels of Federal prosecu-
tion.’’ 
The Children’s Advocacy Center of 
Suffolk County describes her as ‘‘a 
leader who clearly prioritizes the needs 
of children and families—bringing an 
approach which is both victim-centered 
and squarely focused on offender ac-
countability.’’ 
District Attorney Rollins is clear- 
eyed in her commitment to justice— 
justice for victims, justice for families, 
justice for children, and justice for the 
communities that have not historically 
benefited from a system that has pun-
ished color, class, and creed. She is 
working to restore faith in the system 
by building a system that works for ev-
eryone. 
Before she was district attorney, 
from 2007 to 2011, she served as assist-
ant U.S. attorney for the District of 
Massachusetts. There she prosecuted 
civil and criminal cases, defended the 
Federal Government and Agencies in 
civil suits, and recovered damages for 
fraud and false claims submitted to the 
government. 
Based on this record, she has the sup-
port of many law enforcement organi-
zations and political leaders. 
About District Attorney Rollins, a 
group of several current and former 
major city police wrote: 
We do not always get along. In fact, we 
have disagreed strongly on issues. What we 
can say is that she respects us and the work 
we do to keep our communities safe. She can 
admit when she is wrong. She can also be in-
credibly persuasive when she is right. The 
constant throughout every encounter we 
have is a mutual respect and a willingness to 
learn from each other. 
So, for my Republican colleagues, let 
me share the bottom line statistic: 
Crime is down in Boston. Despite the 
continued rise in crime nationwide in 
2021, murders in Boston have dropped 
by one-third so far this year. According 
to data from the Boston Police Depart-
ment, there have been 32 homicides in 
the first 9 months of 2021, down from 45 
homicides this time last year. Murder 
is down in Boston. The city also saw a 
decrease in many types of violent 
crime, 
including 
domestic 
assault. 
Property crimes, such as auto thefts 
and burglary, are also down in the city 
of Boston during her tenure as our dis-
trict attorney. 
We know there is much more work to 
be done to ensure public safety and to 
promote justice, but under District At-
torney Rollins’ leadership, Boston is on 
the right trajectory. 
Most of what we have heard from my 
Republican colleagues—in the com-
mittee hearing and out here on the 
floor—is simply untrue. Suffolk County 
District Attorney Rachael Rollins is a 
strong Black woman, committed to ra-
cial justice with a better record on 
crime than other old-school prosecu-
tors, and it just plain scares them. 
Her approach scares them because it 
is working in Boston. It can be a model 
for the rest of the country. Rachael 
Rollins is not soft on crime; she is 
smart on crime. Yes, District Attorney 
Rollins is a progressive prosecutor. But 
more importantly, she is an effective 
prosecutor. Her extensive law enforce-
ment credentials and proven track 
record of reducing crime and sup-
porting victims is clear, and it is unde-
niable. She is the right candidate for 
U.S. Attorney in Massachusetts, and 
Senator WARREN
and I deeply and 
proudly recommend her to the Senate 
for confirmation. 
I have known District Attorney Rol-
lins since she babysat for my brother’s 
family. She is a dear friend and a loved 
friend, and I have been so fortunate to 
know her. And Massachusetts has been 
so fortunate to have her as one of our 
top law enforcement officials. She is 
one of the smartest, most effective, 
most respected leaders in the Common-
wealth 
of 
Massachusetts, 
and 
her 
record proves that, unequivocally. 
Despite the Republican effort to po-
liticize 
her 
nomination 
and 
mischaracterize her record, I am con-
fident that she will be confirmed as our 
next U.S. Attorney. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
yes on this discharge motion, as unnec-
essary as it should be, and to support 
the confirmation of Rachael Rollins as 
the next U.S. Attorney for the District 
of Massachusetts. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor to echo the sentiments of 
my colleague, Senator MARCO RUBIO. 
Our annual national defense bill is 
being held up because Speaker PELOSI 
and Leader SCHUMER are refusing to 
allow 
a 
vote 
on 
a 
provision—the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act— 
that prevents Chinese goods made with 
forced labor—slave labor—from enter-
ing the United States. This bill was 
previously passed by the Senate on a 
unanimous vote. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party’s 
atrocities against its minorities, par-
ticularly Uyghur people, include geno-
cide and crimes against humanity. 
These are well known. Uyghur women 
are forcibly sterilized and impregnated 
by Han Chinese men. Adults are ripped 
from their families and are sentenced 
into concentration camps and carry 
out slave labor. It is estimated that 
nearly 1 million Uyghur people are 
being treated this way and held in 
these camps. 
There is no question that it should be 
U.S. policy to hold accountable those 
responsible for the forced labor of the 
Uyghurs and ensure that companies— 
our companies—are monitoring their 
supply chains and circumstances of 
workers making products in China, to 
make sure those products that are 
made by slave labor by the Uyghur peo-
ple are not brought into this country. 
That is the feeling of the unanimous 
vote of the Senators, which we already 
expressed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8891 
December 2, 2021 
Congressional Democratic leadership 
is claiming that the problem with in-
cluding this amendment is a techni-
cality, but let’s be clear that what is 
really happening here is there are some 
corporations 
that 
Democrats 
don’t 
want to offend. For example, Demo-
crats want cheap batteries for their so- 
called Build Back Better agenda. And 
nearly 80 percent of the rare earth met-
als, including other materials like lith-
ium and cobalt and the like that are 
used to make those batteries, come 
from China. 
And let’s underscore this. When com-
panies and politicians avert their eyes 
from China’s predations, from China’s 
slavery, they are effectively paying the 
cannibals to eat them last. China is 
coming for them, and it is coming for 
us. 
Now, we have, in this year’s National 
Defense Authorization Act, the oppor-
tunity to strike a blow against China’s 
slavery. I implore Speaker PELOSI and 
Leader SCHUMER to move past proce-
dural roadblocks and send a clear, con-
vincing message to China and the 
world at large that goods produced 
with slave labor are not allowed in the 
United States of America. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Indiana. 
REMEMBERING REVEREND MELVIN GIRTON 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I rise 
today in tribute to Rev. Melvin Girton, 
the dean of pastors, a servant of God, 
and a great Hoosier. His death on Octo-
ber 29 has left a terrible absence, one 
that cannot be filled. For over half a 
century, from 1964 to 2015, Dr. Girton 
was pastor at the Christ Missionary 
Baptist Church—the same Indianapolis 
church home where he was baptized as 
a young boy. 
The number of years Dr. Girton shep-
herded his flock is astonishing. The 
number 
of 
lives 
he 
touched 
and 
bettered among and beyond is incalcu-
lable. He made his church a family. He 
walked with his congregants through 
their lives, their challenges, and in dif-
ficult times, he reminded them to look 
up because brighter days were ahead. 
When one of his congregants needed 
surgery, she arrived at the hospital to 
find Dr. Girton waiting there to reas-
sure her everything would be all right. 
And it was. He was a member of their 
families. He blessed their marriages, 
welcomed their children, and even 
taught them to buy cars and homes. 
And he prepared and opened the doors 
for countless other pastors to follow 
him. 
Dr. Girton was also a great lover of 
history, which is fitting since he made 
a great deal of it himself. During the 
civil rights struggle, he led from the 
pulpit, on the picket lines, during the 
marches to the Governor’s mansion, 
and he worked with Hoosiers from all 
walks of life. His work made great 
strides for equality and pushed Ameri-
cans to realize our founding promise. 
There was a time when Indianapolis’s 
restaurants and theaters were seg-
regated, its neighborhoods closed to 
Black citizens. If rising generations of 
Hoosiers have no memory of this 
shame, it is because men like Dr. 
Girton ended it. He fought to open up 
the city’s businesses, to make access to 
housing equal. 
On April 4, 1968, Dr. Girton sat all 
night with Robert F. Kennedy in his In-
dianapolis hotel room after the Sen-
ator told a heartbroken crowd of Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr’s, murder. The next 
day, he organized a memorial to Dr. 
King at the Soldiers and Sailors Monu-
ment at the city’s center. Indianapolis 
is one of the few metropolitan areas in 
America that did not erupt in violence 
after Dr. King’s death. Senator KEN-
NEDY’s 
beautiful 
and 
conciliatory 
speech is often credited for this, but 
the work of Dr. Girton and other city 
leaders played just as important a part. 
Long after the civil rights move-
ment, he preached kindness and love 
and labored to advance opportunity. He 
served as vice president for the Indian-
apolis branch of the NAACP. He was 
twice the vice president of the Billy 
Graham Crusade and regularly hosted 
the Emancipation Proclamation serv-
ice, an annual celebration of that docu-
ment of freedom. 
Always searching for ways to help his 
neighbors, in the late 1990s, Dr. Girton 
transformed a boarded-up Indianapolis 
strip mall into a community center, 
providing job training, employment op-
portunities, a laundromat, a senior 
center, and even an ice cream shop. 
When he reached the half-century 
mark at Christ Missionary, he called it 
a ‘‘short 50 years.’’ No wonder—five in-
credible decades in a life of great pur-
pose. 
He wasn’t entirely comfortable with 
the term ‘‘legend,’’ but that is what he 
was. His passing deprives not just his 
community but his country of a pillar. 
Despite the grief, it is hard not to be 
encouraged by such a wonderful life 
full of years of lasting achievements, 
courageous stands, admiring friends, 
and many loving children and grand-
children and great-grandchildren. 
Dr. Girton would often say: ‘‘God is 
with me, God is in me, God works 
through me.’’ He was and he did. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
NOMINATION OF RACHEL S. ROLLINS 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, in a 
couple of hours, Senator SCHUMER is 
bringing to the floor one of the most 
dangerous 
pro-crime, 
anti-cop 
U.S. 
nominees in American history. The 
Senate floor leader wants to ram 
through 
President 
Biden’s 
extreme 
nominee to be the U.S. attorney for 
Massachusetts, the current Suffolk 
County district attorney, Rachel Rol-
lins. In doing so, the Democrats are 
showing they don’t care about crime as 
a crime wave crashes across the coun-
try, they do not support law enforce-
ment, and they have a wanton dis-
regard for the safety and security of 
Americans. 
Now, it is true that we rarely have 
record votes of U.S. attorneys in the 
Senate. In fact, I think it has been 28 
years. 
It is also true that Rachael Rollins is 
so radical that she is without prece-
dent as a nominee to be the U.S. attor-
ney. 
Rachael Rollins is the very epitome 
of a Soros prosecutor, although it is 
generous to call her a prosecutor at all. 
For those of you who do not know 
the term, ‘‘Soros prosecutor’’ refers to 
the wave of so-called progressive polit-
ical activists backed by wealthy liberal 
mega donors like George Soros, who 
have run for local district attorney and 
State attorney positions throughout 
the country with the express purpose— 
the express purpose of igniting revolu-
tion and destroying our criminal jus-
tice systems from within. 
They have left a trail of death, pain, 
suffering, and misery in their wake. 
Chicago has already had more than 
1,000 murders this year—1,000 murders, 
with a month to go. Philadelphia has 
already had more than 500—already an 
all-time record. Crime is so bad in San 
Francisco, they closed downtown on 
Black Friday to avoid gangs of armed 
robbers smashing into retail stores and 
stealing everything in sight. They 
closed it on Black Friday because 
Chesa Boudin, the radical Soros pros-
ecutor in San Francisco, has helped a 
crime wave destroy public safety in 
San Francisco so much that the lib-
erals in that city have already an-
nounced a recall petition against him. 
And perhaps most notoriously, just 
last weekend, in Waukesha, a career 
criminal with a rap sheet as long as 
your arm committed mass murder—one 
of the deadliest massacres in recent 
years—while he was out on $1,000 bail; 
$1,000 for a career criminal who con-
sistently committed violent crimes for 
20 years. And the Soros prosecutor in 
Milwaukee who let him out acknowl-
edged that it may have been inappro-
priately low. 
But that is not the unintended con-
sequence; that is the intended con-
sequence: to destroy our criminal jus-
tice system from the inside, to let vio-
lent, repeat felons out immediately 
and not keep them on bail, and then to 
not charge them with the appropriate 
crimes, and then to reduce their sen-
tences when they are convicted. 
What do they all have in common? 
They are all pro-criminal, Soros pros-
ecutors, just like Rachael Rollins—the 
first one to be nominated for U.S. at-
torney. 
Now, she is not simply a Soros pros-
ecutor, she is one of the most pre-
eminent legal arsonists in the country. 
She is a founding member of an organi-
zation of Soros prosecutors called the 
Truth, 
Justice, 
and 
Reconciliation 
Commission, which claims that the 
American justice system—and this is a 
quote; this is a direct quote—has ‘‘been 
a cruel and oppressive force of injustice 
for 
. . . 
all 
marginalized 
commu-
nities.’’ 
And she also claims—this is, again, a 
direct quote—‘‘this isn’t a bug in the

system, but a feature. It’s operating 
exactly the way it was designed and 
built to function.’’ 
That is her view of our criminal jus-
tice system, that it is a cruel and op-
pressive 
force 
of 
injustice 
for 
marginalized communities; that is not 
a bug; that is a feature. 
That is textbook critical race theory. 
Rachael Rollins believes that the 
American criminal justice system is 
racist and rotten to its core, and the 
Democrats want to put her in charge of 
prosecuting criminals in the largest 
State in New England. Rollins hopes to 
destroy the criminal justice system 
from within. That is not hyperbole. 
She has not been shy about her views, 
until she was nominated for this office, 
of course. 
When asked why she became a pros-
ecutor last year, she answered—again, 
this is a direct quote. I am not making 
it up. You may find it hard to believe. 
This is her own words why she wanted 
to be a prosecutor: ‘‘I chose to jump 
into this job to dismantle the system 
from the inside.’’ 
Soon after being sworn in as district 
attorney of Suffolk County, MA, she 
declared that she was going to battle— 
going to battle—against the U.S. attor-
ney on offenses like opioids, mari-
juana, and immigration. 
Just think about that. A newly elect-
ed prosecutor in the largest city of the 
State decided that her mission was not 
to stop criminals, not to protect inno-
cent civilians, but to stop the U.S. at-
torney in that State from prosecuting 
criminals, and now she wants that job 
for herself. 
I don’t think so. 
Mrs. Rollins also published a list of 
15 crimes that she would refuse to pros-
ecute except in special cases, sending 
the clear message to criminals that it 
was open season to commit these 
crimes. 
Among the crimes on Rollins’ pre-
sumptive do-not-prosecute list are not 
just things like jaywalking, but things 
like drug trafficking with intent to dis-
tribute, including fentanyl, malicious 
destruction 
of 
property, 
criminal 
threats, breaking and entering, tres-
passing, resisting arrest, and more. 
This isn’t an exercise of prosecutorial 
discretion in a case with exceptional 
circumstances. This is prosecutorial 
nullification. The Legislature of Mas-
sachusetts passed criminal laws that 
prosecutors are elected to enforce, and 
she refuses to enforce them. 
What do you think she will do to our 
Federal criminal laws? 
What do you think she will do to you 
if you are a homeowner in Suffolk 
County and someone trespasses on 
your yard and walks up to your window 
to see if you are home or not? 
And if you are not, they will break 
and enter because you won’t be pros-
ecuted. And if you are home, well, they 
will just walk off the lawn and wait 
until you leave. And you dial 9–1-1, and 
the police won’t even answer because 
they know Rachael Rollins won’t pros-
ecute you. 
And this is the woman that Joe Biden 
nominated to be a U.S. attorney in this 
county. I don’t think so. 
Rollins has tarred police officers as 
murderers, causing the Boston Police 
Patrolmen’s Association to condemn 
her for ‘‘undoubtedly incit[ing] vio-
lence against the proud men and 
women of the Boston Police Depart-
ment.’’ 
Her response, naturally, was to ac-
cuse the Boston police of ‘‘white fra-
gility.’’ That is not a summary; that is 
an exact quote. She accused the Boston 
police of ‘‘white fragility.’’ 
There is a word for what Mrs. Rollins 
traffics in, and that word is ‘‘racism;’’ 
presuming that every officer in the 
Boston Police Department is guilty of 
‘‘white 
fragility,’’ 
presumably 
the 
Black and the Hispanic and the Asian 
ones too. 
The truth is that Rollins has nothing 
but contempt for the rule of law. If she 
is confirmed, the citizens of Massachu-
setts and New Hampshire and all of 
New England will suffer the dangerous 
consequences. We have already seen 
these consequences in her own county. 
In 2020, the first full year in which 
her policies have been in force, Bos-
ton’s violent crime rate surged, and the 
number of murders skyrocketed by 38 
percent. 
When Rollins took office, Suffolk 
County had the fifth highest opioid 
overdose death numbers in Massachu-
setts, with 39 percent fewer deaths 
than the leading county. By the end of 
2020, not surprisingly, Suffolk County’s 
opioid overdose deaths had increased 
by 32 percent, and Suffolk County had 
become the second deadliest county for 
opioid overdoses. 
If Rollins’ abysmal record is brought 
to Massachusetts as a whole, it also 
poses a significant threat to the health 
and safety of the people of New Eng-
land, 
especially 
New 
Hampshire—a 
threat that extends beyond the 100,000 
Granite Staters who work in Massa-
chusetts. 
Rollins’ insane drug policies would 
worsen the drug epidemic, which is al-
ready ravaging New Hampshire. The 
opioid crisis, which is fueled by nar-
cotics smuggled from Massachusetts, is 
responsible for over 80 percent of drug 
overdose deaths in New Hampshire. 
Cartels and traffickers use Boston and 
its ports as a staging ground to smug-
gle vast quantities of heroin and other 
drugs into New Hampshire. 
Rollins’ failure to vigorously enforce 
Federal drug laws in Massachusetts 
will severely harm families and com-
munities not just in her own State, but 
in New Hampshire and across New Eng-
land. 
Rollins’ appalling statements, ac-
tions, and records caused Republicans 
on the Senate Judiciary Committee to 
unanimously—unanimously—oppose 
her nomination. That is a nearly un-
precedented action for a U.S. attorney 
nomination, and it is not one that we 
took lightly. 
By contrast, for example, Repub-
licans have allowed President Biden’s 
other 15 U.S. attorney nominees across 
the country to go through committee 
with a simple voice vote. It goes to 
show that Mrs. Rollins is uniquely 
unfit for the role of U.S. attorney and 
deserves no deference from the Senate 
and no confirmation. 
If the Democrats vote to confirm 
Rachael Rollins, they will be respon-
sible for every action she takes. It is 
not a secret. It is right here in her 
record. And when crime spikes in Mas-
sachusetts and crime spikes in New 
Hampshire, Democratic Senators who 
are on the ballot next year are going to 
answer for it. 
And I promise I will be there to make 
you answer for it if you vote for her 
today. 
And if you are a Soros prosecutor 
around the country watching this nom-
ination today and you think maybe 
you are next if Ms. Rollins is con-
firmed, maybe you can be the U.S. at-
torney, maybe you can be the attorney 
general in your State, I promise you, 
this will not be the start of a trend. I 
will stop at nothing to make sure none 
of you ever achieve higher office and 
none of you get reelected, because you 
are a danger to the families and the 
communities of this country. 
President Biden should immediately 
withdraw Mrs. Rollins’ nomination and 
should consider submitting someone 
who would actually be a prosecutor 
rather than a pro-crime, defund-the-po-
lice activist to serve as a U.S. attorney 
in Massachusetts. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of Rachael Rol-
lins, the U.S. attorney nominee for the 
District of Massachusetts. 
Rachael grew up in Massachusetts. 
Her dad fought in Vietnam, and then 
returned to Massachusetts to become a 
corrections officer. He sent his oldest 
daughter to college, UMass Amherst, 
and then to the law school at North-
eastern, and then she went on to get a 
master’s in law from Georgetown. 
She has had experience across a 
broad range of public service jobs. In 
2018, she decided to run for district at-
torney of Suffolk County, which in-
cludes the city of Boston. And in that 
race, she promised to decriminalize 
certain low-level offenses, such as 
shoplifting or drug possession. 
The people of Suffolk County em-
braced her and embraced her ideas, giv-
ing her 73 percent of the vote. She is 
the first woman of color to be elected 
as a DA in Massachusetts, and if con-
firmed by this body, she will be the 
first Black woman to serve as U.S. at-
torney in Massachusetts. 
She has the enthusiastic support of 
my partner Ed Markey and myself. 
A dedicated public servant, Rollins 
has devoted her career to transforming 
the criminal justice system so that it 
actually reduces crime and provides 
equal justice for all. Her reform efforts 
have frequently focused on the root

December 2, 2021 
causes of crime and have taken aim at 
poverty, substance use disorders, and 
racial disparity. 
Since 
her 
nomination 
was 
an-
nounced, dozens of prominent Massa-
chusetts Republicans, Democrats, and 
nonpartisan law enforcement officials, 
numbers of community advocates, and 
members of the legal community have 
written in support of her nomination. 
Among those who have spoken out pub-
licly on her behalf are Massachusetts 
former Republican Governor Bill Weld, 
former U.S. attorneys and Suffolk 
County law enforcement executives, 
and many, many others. These are the 
people who know her best, the people 
who have worked with her, the people 
who know her record of success as a 
prosecutor. 
Now, Rachael has implemented some 
innovative 
policies—exactly 
as 
she 
promised to do when she ran for dis-
trict attorney. Those policies may not 
be the preferred policies of some Sen-
ators, but the facts speak for them-
selves. 
These policies are designed to im-
prove the administration of justice and 
to reduce crime, and they work. In the 
months following her start as a DA in 
2019, homicides in Suffolk County 
reached a 20-year low. While homicides 
increased in 2020 as part of a nation-
wide trend following the start of the 
pandemic—a trend that was also seen 
in States like Arkansas and Texas—re-
cent data from the Boston Police De-
partment shows that homicides in Bos-
ton declined by nearly a third in the 
first 9 months of 2021. That drop—a 
drop of nearly a third in homicides— 
stands in stark contrast with nation-
wide crime statistics. It is not just vio-
lent crime, either; the city saw a de-
cline in property crimes like thefts and 
burglaries this year as well. 
Rollins has demonstrated that pro-
gressive policies can be effective in 
cutting serious crimes, which seems to 
frustrate her opponents. The policies 
that Rollins has pursued have helped 
drive down crime in our State, but it is 
also the strong partnership she has 
built with law enforcement leaders 
from Suffolk County that has been cru-
cial. In fact, leadership from the Bos-
ton Police Department, the Massachu-
setts State Police, the Revere Police 
Department, the Chelsea Police De-
partment, the MBTA Transit Police 
Department, and the Winthrop Police 
Department wrote a joint letter to the 
Senate to express their strong support 
of Rachael Rollins to be U.S. attorney. 
While they admit they have not al-
ways seen eye to eye with her, they 
also note that Rollins ‘‘respects us and 
the work we do to keep our commu-
nities safe. She can admit when she is 
wrong. She can also be incredibly per-
suasive when she is right.’’ 
They add: 
Each of us have worked closely with DA 
Rollins on pressing and significant issues 
within our respective jurisdictions. She is re-
sponsive, attentive, and diligent. Her focus is 
on victims and how the community is im-
pacted by violence and harm. 
Nobody should be surprised that Rol-
lins’ approach to prosecution is yield-
ing reductions in crime. Nonpartisan 
research published by the National Bu-
reau of Economic Research confirms 
why this is the case. After an analysis 
of 17 years of data and over 67,000 cases 
from the Suffolk County DA’s Office, 
the study found that defendants whose 
misdemeanor charges were dropped be-
fore arraignment were 58 percent less 
likely to return to the criminal justice 
system in the next 2 years, and they 
were more likely to avoid charges for 
any serious violent crimes. 
By pursuing these policies, Rollins 
has freed up limited resources in her 
office to focus on the people and the 
crimes that actually pose the biggest 
threats to the community. 
Now, critics are quick to distort 
these statistics and Rollins’ record and 
the details of her approach. This par-
tisan sniping here in Washington bears 
no relationship to the reality on the 
ground in Suffolk County, MA. For ex-
ample, even with her reform policies in 
place, Rachael has prosecuted more 
drug traffickers than her predecessor. 
Between January 1 and October 12 of 
this year, the Suffolk County DA’s Of-
fice prosecuted 147 trafficking cases. Of 
those, 
charges 
of 
trafficking 
in 
fentanyl accounted for 67 percent of 
the total drug trafficking prosecutions. 
Just by comparison, her predecessor 
prosecuted only 130 trafficking cases 
during the entirety of 2018, of which 
only 40 percent involved fentanyl traf-
ficking charges. 
Now, look, it is no surprise that some 
rightwing voices have sought to make 
an issue out of Rollins’ nomination, 
and it is unfortunate that many Repub-
licans who should know better have 
fallen in line behind this campaign of 
fearmongering. 
When a rollcall vote on her nomina-
tion was forced in the Judiciary Com-
mittee 
in 
September, 
Republicans 
quickly 
tossed 
out 
three 
decades’ 
worth of precedent and attempted for 
the first time in over a generation to 
override the President’s choice of a 
U.S. attorney nomination. 
I want to remind my colleagues that 
every single one of the 85 U.S. attor-
neys nominated by Trump—every sin-
gle one—was moved by voice vote de-
spite significant disagreements about 
the policies, views, and records of sev-
eral of those nominees—every single 
one of them. But Rachael Rollins and 
President Biden couldn’t get that same 
kind of consideration. 
This kind of political grandstanding 
has unjustly deferred the confirmation 
process, not only for Rachael Rollins 
but 
for 
many 
other 
well-qualified 
nominees who just want to get to work 
serving the people of this country. It is 
also extraordinarily disrespectful to 
the scores of on-the-ground law en-
forcement leaders in Massachusetts 
and others who support this nomina-
tion. 
Our police chiefs, our prosecutors, 
our former U.S. attorneys, our former 
Governors, 
Republicans 
and 
Demo-
crats, do not need to be told by na-
tional politicians who know nothing 
about our community that their sup-
port and their understanding of what 
we need just really doesn’t matter. 
They do not need to be told that the 
personal political benefit of attacking 
this well-respected prosecutor is some-
how more important than what all of 
the data and all of their own experi-
ences tell them about what actually re-
duces crime and improves the adminis-
tration of justice in Massachusetts. 
What our law enforcement profes-
sionals need, what the entire Common-
wealth of Massachusetts needs is for 
the Senate to confirm this highly 
qualified nominee. 
Now, I have every confidence that 
Rachael Rollins will continue her part-
nership with law enforcement, with 
community advocates, and with other 
key members of the legal community 
to ensure the safety and well-being of 
all of the people of the Commonwealth 
in her new role. I look forward to the 
renewed energy and innovative vision 
that she will bring to the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office. 
Senator MARKEY and I want to pub-
licly thank our Massachusetts bipar-
tisan advisory committee for all of the 
work they did to identify and rec-
ommend candidates like Rachael Rol-
lins to the role of U.S. attorney. I want 
to thank President Biden for nomi-
nating her to this position. 
I urge my colleagues to set aside 
nasty personal attacks on a supremely 
well-qualified woman and to support 
the discharge and ultimate confirma-
tion of Rachael Rollins, a supremely 
qualified candidate who is ready to 
serve on day one as the next U.S. attor-
ney for the District of Massachusetts. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
first, I want to thank my colleague 
from Massachusetts for her very impor-
tant comments about a very impor-
tant, well-qualified nominee. 
OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Madam President, today I rise to 
speak about a heartbreaking tragedy 
that far too many American families 
and communities are familiar with. 
Americans have learned that gun vio-
lence can happen in any place, at any 
time, in any State, and in any town. 
This time, the community is Oxford, 
MI, home to about 20,000 people in 
northwest Oakland County. It is a 
place with beautiful lakes and bike 
trails. It is a place where people know 
each other. It is the kind of place 
where the neighbors might drop off 
some Christmas cookies or clear your 
sidewalk after a snowstorm since they 
were doing theirs anyway. Now, it is 
the kind of place that has been need-
lessly, senselessly shattered by un-
speakable violence. 
It was a typical Tuesday at Oxford 
High School, home of the Wildcats. The 
Oxford band and orchestra had recently

returned from a trip of a lifetime, per-
forming at Disney World. Student lead-
ers 
were 
celebrating 
a 
successful 
Thanksgiving food drive—almost 5,500 
cans of food collected for the local food 
pantry. Athletes in winter sports were 
getting ready for Meet the Teams 
Night. But in an instant, everything 
changed. Everything changed. 
We are still learning the details, and, 
frankly, that is not what is important. 
What is important is that, thanks to 
the cold efficiency of modern weap-
onry, it took mere minutes for a gun-
man to shatter a community. Thank-
fully, law enforcement officers showed 
up within minutes, but still, 11 people 
were shot. Tragically, four students 
have died. We hope and pray that there 
are not more deaths, but several other 
Oxford students remain in the hospital 
in critical condition. A typical Tuesday 
in a typical high school in 2021 in 
America. 
Madisyn Baldwin was a 17-year-old 
with a beautiful smile. According to 
her grandmother, she was a kind and 
patient big sister and an artist. She 
had already been accepted to a number 
of colleges. 
Justin Shilling, also 17, was cocap-
tain of the school’s bowling team and 
also loved to golf. He worked at Anita’s 
Kitchen, a Lebanese cafe in nearby 
Lake Orion, where his boss said every-
one loved him. 
Tate Myre, aged 16 and a tight end 
and running back on the Oxford foot-
ball team, had recently been honored 
by the Michigan High School Football 
Coaches Association. He was also an 
honor student who was known as a 
leader both on the field and in the 
classroom. 
And Hana St. Juliana was just 14 
years old. She was passionate about 
volleyball and basketball. Her team-
mates say they will never forget her 
kind heart and her silly personality 
and her passion for the game. They 
have dedicated their upcoming season 
in her memory. 
Madisyn, Justin, Tate, and Hana— 
four lives that were just beginning, 
four losses that have left their families 
and 
their 
community 
struggling— 
struggling—to understand. 
And we certainly know that Oxford is 
not alone. This year alone, there have 
been shootings at 29 schools in our 
country—29 schools—from Rigby Mid-
dle School in Rigby, ID, to Timberview 
High School in Arlington, TX, to Herit-
age High School in Newport News, VA. 
No community is immune. Just ask the 
grieving residents and the grieving par-
ents of Oxford. 
This community will come together. 
They already have. They will hold 
prayer vigils and deliver casseroles and 
wrap their arms around these shattered 
families. But, in God’s name, why 
should they have to? 
High school students should be shar-
ing memories of last month’s band trip 
or celebrating a successful food drive 
or looking forward to the spotlight of 
Meet the Teams Night. They shouldn’t 
be ducking for cover in their class-
rooms or fighting for their lives in the 
ICU because they just happened to be 
in the wrong hallway at the wrong 
time, and they certainly shouldn’t 
have their names mentioned during a 
speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
after yet another school shooting in 
2021 in America. 
Madisyn, Justin, Tate, Hana, and the 
more than 100 Americans who are 
killed by gun violence every day de-
serve more than thoughts and prayers. 
They deserve action to keep them safe, 
and we certainly will focus on this in 
the days ahead. What I know for sure 
right now is that we must refuse to set-
tle for a world in which a typical Tues-
day turns into such tragedy. 
My deepest, heartfelt sympathies to 
everyone in Oxford and throughout our 
State. I share in their grieving of this 
senseless, senseless tragedy. 
I yield the floor to my partner and 
colleague in the U.S. Senate, Senator 
PETERS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. 
PETERS. 
Madam 
President, 
there are no words that can capture the 
terror and the tragedy of the horrific 
events that unfolded at Oxford High 
School on Tuesday afternoon. 
In a matter of minutes, a routine 
school day was twisted into scenes of 
chaos, shattering the safe environment 
that Oxford High students and teachers 
and families trusted in. This shocking 
event will change their lives forever. 
Our heart breaks for every Michigander 
in America who continues to be af-
fected by this tragedy and so many 
others like it. 
It was a scene that has become all 
too familiar in America. A gunman 
opened fire inside a public school, tak-
ing four young lives and wounding 
seven other people. Four students went 
to school that morning with bright, ex-
citing futures ahead. They never made 
it home. 
Hana St. Juliana, the youngest vic-
tim, was only 14 years old. A freshman 
who was a promising athlete on the 
volleyball and basketball teams, her 
teammates remember her as having a 
kind heart, a silly personality, and an 
absolute passion for sports. Her father 
remembers her as the happiest kid, 
who had a full life ahead of her before 
it was tragically cut short. 
Madisyn Baldwin, a 17-year-old sen-
ior and the oldest of three siblings, was 
preparing to graduate this spring. An 
aspiring artist and talented student, 
she recently celebrated acceptances to 
several colleges, including some under 
a full-ride scholarship. She will always 
be remembered by her family and 
friends as a kind, smart, and loving 
girl. 
Tate Myre was 16 years old, No. 42 on 
the football team. Tate was a star stu-
dent athlete and was recently honored 
with an all-region award from the 
Michigan High School Football Coach-
es Association. He had already started 
college recruitment visits and was 
looking forward to many more until 
the unthinkable happened. His friends, 
his family, and his fellow students re-
member him as someone who always 
put his full heart into everything that 
he did. 
And Justin Shilling, a 17-year-old 
senior, was cocaptain of the school’s 
bowling team. His coworkers called 
him an exemplary employee, a devoted 
friend and coworker, and simply an ab-
solute pleasure to be with. 
As we mourn Hana, Madisyn, Tate, 
and Justin, we must also remember the 
victims who were injured during this 
attack. At this very moment, dedicated 
doctors and nurses are working around 
the clock to ensure that the wounded 
can swiftly recover. We are all think-
ing of them and wishing them well, 
along with those who were wounded, 
treated, and have now been discharged 
from the hospital. 
As a parent, I just simply cannot 
imagine the grief and anguish that 
these families are forced to endure and 
the unimaginable pain that these par-
ents are feeling in knowing that they 
can never—never ever—hold their lov-
ing child again. 
I am grateful for the brave first re-
sponders who quickly responded to this 
harrowing scene. Thanks to their swift 
and brave actions, the suspect was ap-
prehended within minutes, preventing 
even more unspeakable carnage from 
unfolding. There is no question that 
the heroic actions of first responders, 
law enforcement officials, and emer-
gency medical technicians saved lives 
on Tuesday. We cannot thank enough 
these brave men and women for all 
that they do each and every day to 
keep our communities safe. 
For the students and the educators 
who lived through this horrific act, I 
can only imagine the trauma and the 
fear that they will spend the rest of 
their lives with. 
Children who should have been fo-
cused on their math homework or on 
their reading assignments spent terri-
fying moments fighting to survive and 
keeping one another safe. Reportedly, 
as bullets pierced classroom doors, stu-
dents grabbed scissors and calculators, 
anything they thought they could use, 
to defend themselves. 
Parents—many 
of 
whom 
received 
text messages from their children say-
ing there was a shooting and that they 
loved them—frantically searched for 
their children in a parking lot in the 
aftermath, praying that they would be 
reunited. 
The panic, the fear, and the helpless-
ness of being trapped in this nightmare 
scenario is something that no child, no 
teacher, and no parent should ever, 
ever have to face. Now these survivors 
need our support as they work to proc-
ess and heal from the shocking and 
horrific ordeal. 
To the Oxford High School commu-
nity, please know there are millions of 
Americans who are lifting you up and 
who share in your sorrow. 
In the days and weeks ahead, we may 
learn more about the heroic actions

S8895 
December 2, 2021 
that students and teachers and first re-
sponders took to stop this tragedy 
from being even worse, but the most 
heartbreaking fact is that this should 
have never ever happened in the first 
place. A school should be a safe place. 
I was struck by the words of so many 
students who said that they had been 
training for a day like this since ele-
mentary school. These students and 
their teachers had participated in ac-
tive shooter drills. They knew to lock 
and barricade doors, to hide, to stay si-
lent, and to run. They had heard about 
other school shootings wherein the as-
sailants had tried to trick or lure stu-
dents into their sights, and they stood 
strong until they knew they would be 
safe. 
While I am so grateful that these les-
sons, undoubtedly, saved many, many 
lives this week, I am also heartbroken 
that our children and our educators 
have to bear this burden. 
There is no easy answer, but it is 
clear that we must take action. Far 
too many communities have been dev-
astated by these attacks, and we can-
not wait for yet another community to 
suffer without having tough conversa-
tions on what actions Congress should 
take. The unsettling reality is that our 
children’s lives are at risk when they 
enter a classroom, and that is some-
thing that we simply cannot tolerate. 
I know the Members of this body 
have different policy views, but surely 
we can agree that a school should be a 
safe place. Surely we can agree to lis-
ten to the students in every single one 
of our States who say that they live in 
fear that they could be killed at their 
desks, and we could agree to have a se-
rious discussion of what needs to 
change. 
There is no single solution that 
would have prevented this tragedy, like 
so many others, but let’s have a serious 
discussion about what needs to change 
to ensure that warnings reach the right 
officials and that those officials know 
what actions to take. 
Let’s have a serious discussion about 
gun safety issues, background checks, 
reasonable 
limits 
on 
high-capacity 
magazines, and closing loopholes that 
allow dangerous weapons to get into 
the wrong hands. 
And let’s have a serious discussion 
about what our schools, our teachers, 
and our students need to stay safe. 
Whether it is more access to coun-
selors, strong threat assessments, or 
more resources, we have to find com-
mon ground that will keep our schools 
safe. We cannot stand by when we 
know that it is only a matter of time 
before the next school, the next com-
munity, is shattered. 
For Hana, for Tate, for Justin, for 
Madisyn, for the students, teachers, 
and families of Oxford High School, and 
for every student, teacher, and family 
in the United States, we must act. The 
time is now. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The junior Senator from 
Alaska. 
TRIBUTE TO BETH BRAGG 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is Thursday, and it is usually the day I 
get to come down to the Senate floor. 
Usually, the Senate is kind of wrapping 
up things; we are still pretty busy right 
now. But it is the day I love to come 
down to the Senate floor and talk 
about somebody in my State, the great 
State of Alaska, who is making a dif-
ference either for their community, for 
their State, for the country; you name 
it. We call this person the Alaskan of 
the Week. 
We have done it a lot. I usually like 
to give a little bit of an update. The 
pages typically really like this time of 
the week because we get to tell stories 
about Alaska, about the adventure of 
Alaska, but also about—typically, a 
little update about what is happening 
in the State. 
Right now, we are in a bit of a cold 
snap 
pretty 
much 
throughout 
the 
State. We are getting a lot of snow 
throughout the State. We have seen 
some 
record 
low 
temperatures 
all 
across Alaska, from Homer, King Salm-
on, Bethel. 
Monday in Fairbanks—so this is not 
even into December yet—it was 26 
below zero. They are tough in Fair-
banks, very tough. You get down to 50, 
60 below in Fairbanks. 
My wife is from Fairbanks. She is a 
wonderful volunteer for this organiza-
tion called Covenant House. They did 
their annual ‘‘Sleep Out.’’ It is a home-
less shelter for teenage youth. This was 
in Anchorage just a couple of weeks 
ago. It was 15 below for the ‘‘Sleep 
Out.’’ You get a cardboard box and say: 
Good luck. So, boy, she is tough. 
Alaskans across the State are rug-
ged, tough, individualistic, and we 
bond all the more for it. We are in it 
together when it is that cold. And it 
frequently is. And like one big commu-
nity, one of the many things that 
brings us together—actually, one of the 
many things that brings Americans to-
gether—is bonding over sports: local 
sports, State sports, national sports, 
and your local newspaper as it relates 
to sports reporting. It is actually a uni-
versal instinct. 
One of our most famous Supreme 
Court Justices, Earl Warren, said it 
best: 
I always turn to the sports section first [in 
the morning]. The sports page records peo-
ple’s accomplishments. The front page [usu-
ally] has nothing but [people’s] failures. 
I am not sure that is always true, but 
it is a good anecdote in terms of what 
binds us with regard to sports. 
You know, over the holidays, in par-
ticular, everybody in America watches 
great football, other sports activities. I 
had a good chat over lunch today with 
Coach Tuberville about the really in-
credible Alabama Auburn game that 
just happened last week. 
But sports is also the place in our 
local papers where we see the names of 
our children, our loved ones, our neigh-
bors, our friends. In fact, it might just 
be the only time their names appear in 
the paper at all, when you think about 
it. 
So our Alaskan of the Week this 
week is somebody who knows sports 
and sportswriting in Alaska better 
than anybody. We are talking about 
Beth Bragg, who recently retired after 
35 years as a sportswriter for the An-
chorage Daily News. She understood all 
of these attributes about sportswriting 
better than anybody. 
During her 35 years at the paper, 
Beth always told cub reporters there 
was one rule they must always follow, 
no matter what. She said: Even if the 
person’s name is something like Cindy 
Jones, ask that person for the spelling. 
It might be the only time their name 
appears in the paper, and it is very im-
portant that name is spelled correctly. 
Now, let me talk about Beth, about 
her reporting and about her work and 
how it has added to our communities 
across the great State of Alaska. 
Beth grew up in Billings, MT. Her fa-
ther worked for the Billings Gazette. 
And she, too, while still in high school, 
joined the paper as a sports clerk so 
this is in her blood. 
Now, it wasn’t so much that she was 
crazy about sports back then, but it 
was a job, a good job. And then she said 
she began, bit by bit, to fall in love 
with newspapers and sports reporting. 
She liked the irreverence, the strict 
deadlines, the energy. 
Importantly—and 
it 
is 
almost 
counterintuitive—covering sports al-
lows more fun in the writing, the op-
portunity as a writer to take a little 
bit more in terms of chances and to be 
more creative than maybe on other 
beats. And throughout the years, Beth 
has brought so much of this kind of 
creativity, so much heart to her sto-
ries. 
Without looking at a byline in Alas-
ka, you always knew when you were 
reading a Beth Bragg story. So, in 1986, 
when she was 27 years old, she came to 
Alaska to write for the Anchorage 
Daily News. That is our State’s biggest 
paper. She thought she would stay for 
a few years, then move on. Her dream 
was to cover professional sports, maybe 
even Major League Baseball in a city 
that has got a Major League Baseball 
team, but as the years progressed, she 
stayed in Alaska. She fell in love with 
Alaska, and her ambitions as a sports-
writer changed. But, in some ways, 
they got even bigger. 
She discovered that, in her words, 
‘‘the real reward, and the real chal-
lenge, is to find stories that resonate 
with everyone. And you don’t have to 
be at the Super Bowl to do that.’’ 
In fact, Beth said she found more in-
teresting, more unique stories to cover 
in Alaska than probably anywhere else. 
Now, we don’t have big-time profes-
sional sports teams in the great State 
of Alaska, but we do have sports, loads 
of sports. And just like so much about 
Alaska, we have expanded the meaning 
of what it means to partake in sports. 
Let’s take one very famous sport in 
Alaska, the Iditarod—the famous 800-

mile sled dog race—as one big example. 
There is also heli-skiing, ice climbing, 
curling, and snowboarding. It didn’t 
get its start in Alaska, but it reached 
its apex in Valdez, for those who par-
ticipated in that incredible sport. 
Beth is likely one of the few, if only, 
reporters in the country who reported 
on this incredible sport in Alaska at 3 
a.m., seal-skinning. Yes, that is a 
sport. It goes along with the ear pull 
and other sports in terms of competi-
tion at the World Eskimo Indian Olym-
pics, which are incredible to go to and 
watch in Alaska—great athletes, by 
the way. 
She covered seal skinning, the com-
petition. At 3 a.m. she was tired, but 
the excitement and the smell of the 
seals—first frozen, then thawed for the 
competition—kept her wide awake. 
We may not have professional sports 
teams, but we certainly have athletic 
stars galore in Alaska. For 35 years, 
Beth has written about these stars and 
some of the toughest athletes any-
where in the world. Let me give you a 
couple examples. 
She wrote about athletes running 
Mount Marathon. Now, I gave an 
‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ speech several 
months ago about Mount Marathon. It 
is what Outside magazine calls ‘‘the 
toughest 5K on the planet’’—straight 
up a mountain and straight back down. 
We always do it on July 4 in Seward. 
She wrote about the Alaska Wilder-
ness Classic, the 150-or-so-mile ‘‘secret 
race’’ up mountains and across rivers 
in the Alaskan wilderness. Here are the 
rules of the Alaska Wilderness Classic: 
No outside support, nothing human- 
powered, leave no trace, and rescue is 
up to the racer. Pretty tough. Pretty 
tough. 
She wrote about the Arctic Man, an-
other incredible Alaska event that has 
been described as one of the world’s 
toughest downhill ski races and an ex-
citing snow machine race, all combined 
together. You want to see something 
amazing? Go to the Arctic Man. 
She has written about swimming 
heats and cross-country track and field 
matches; skiing, lots of stories about 
skiing in Alaska; ice hockey; high 
school football; basketball games; and, 
as I mentioned, the World Eskimo-In-
dian Olympics, with the ear pull and 
the blanket toss. 
She wrote a great story about a 
mother and son literally tied by rope 
together for 2 weeks climbing Denali, 
North America’s tallest peak, in Alas-
ka. 
There was a story about a sled dog 
that was cut loose and ran away from 
her Iditarod sled dog pack. Miracu-
lously, this dog found her way home to 
her kennel through mountain ranges 
and hundreds of miles of tundra in the 
dead of an Alaskan winter. Pretty 
amazing. 
She wrote a great story about an 
event I attended this past June, an in-
spiring USA Patriots-Amputee Softball 
Team event where almost every player 
on that team were some of our greatest 
American heroes. Almost all of them 
had lost a limb—all of them had lost a 
limb, mostly in combat. 
Always at the center of Beth’s stories 
are the people, even when those people 
are sled dogs. She has written about 
their victories; their struggles; their 
heart for the game, for their teams, for 
their communities, for their State, for 
their country, and for life itself. 
Thinking back on her long career, a 
few events stay with her. She talked a 
lot about what it was like to watch 
Alaskans compete in the Olympics, 
four of which she attended—Olympic 
Games. 
Now, we are a huge State. I talk 
about that a lot. We have a pretty 
small population relative to other 
States—730,000 people. But Alaska is 
really good in terms of Olympic ath-
letes. We punch way above our weight, 
sending some of the top American ath-
letes to especially the Winter Olympics 
but also the Summer Olympics. 
Beth remembers, for example, the 
electricity in the Olympic stadium in 
Norway in 1994 when a little-known 
Alaskan named Tommy Moe shocked 
the world by winning the gold in the 
downhill and then, 4 days later, a sil-
ver, becoming the first American skier 
ever to win two medals at the same 
Olympics. 
She remembers writing stories about 
the legendary and beloved cross-coun-
try skier from Alaska Kikkan Randall 
when Kikkan was just 13 years old. 
Then, like so many Alaskans, Beth 
swelled with pride and cried when 
Kikkan Randall won the gold in 2018. 
Beth said she also cried just this 
summer when 17-year-old Lydia Jacoby 
from Seward, AK, shocked the world by 
winning the gold medal in Tokyo this 
summer in the 100-meter breaststroke. 
Remember that? Seward, AK, doesn’t 
even have an Olympic-size swimming 
pool. And I will say, Lydia Jacoby is 
the only person in U.S. history to be 
Alaskan of the Week in the U.S. Senate 
twice. That is unbelievable. 
Of course, there are heartbreaks, 
too—the losses, the illnesses, the inju-
ries, and sometimes the deaths—all of 
which Beth has handled with the ut-
most sensitivity. Because she was at it 
for so long and has so much history 
with Alaskan athletes, she understood 
something about them that a new re-
porter might not. It takes a certain 
kind of grit to be an athlete in Alaska, 
to wake up at 6 a.m. and head off into 
the dark, subzero weather to train. It 
takes a certain kind of grit to travel 
outside of Alaska for competitions, 
often thousands of miles away from 
your home, to get noticed. As Beth 
said, ‘‘You have to work hard to make 
it big’’ in Alaska. As a result, she 
thinks Alaska athletes have a sense of 
home in a way a lot of other athletes 
don’t. 
As I said, Beth recently retired. She 
is going to clean her home; maybe 
travel some; of course, watch some 
sports, as a fan now, not as a reporter. 
She leaves behind a great legacy, thou-
sands of stories charting some of our 
State’s greatest moments in athletics, 
times when we all cheered and cried 
and came together to support the best 
of our people and competition and grit 
and determination—the reason Ameri-
cans across the country love sports so 
much. 
So, Beth, thank you for your great 
job. Congrats on an incredibly stellar 
career, and, of course—I am sure one of 
your biggest honors ever—congratula-
tions on being our Alaskan of the 
Week. 
JOHN KERRY 
Madam President, we are working on 
the NDAA. Is anyone watching what is 
happening on the Senate floor right 
now? It has been stalled in terms of 
amendments, and it has been stalled, 
reportedly, because of an amendment— 
a simple amendment that I think the 
vast majority of Americans would 
agree on—that Senator RUBIO is trying 
to get a vote on. 
But, as there are with so many sto-
ries in the last 6 months, there is some-
thing about the climate envoy John 
Kerry, who keeps coming into different 
stories, and he is in this story as well. 
He seems to show up everywhere, al-
ways when somebody in this adminis-
tration is doing something to under-
mine American interests. There is 
something about John Kerry. 
Let me give you the latest. Senator 
RUBIO is trying to move forward with 
regard to an amendment on his bill, 
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act. It is essentially a pretty simple 
bill. Human rights communities agree 
with it. I think everybody in the Sen-
ate agrees with it. It, in essence, just 
says that we shouldn’t be importing 
solar panels and other products made 
in China that are produced with forced 
labor or slave labor. What American 
wouldn’t agree with that? What Amer-
ican wouldn’t agree with that? I think 
every Senator agrees with that. But 
evidently there is one American who 
disagrees with that. 
Here is an article today from the 
Free Beacon that talks about senior 
Biden officials are worried that this 
bill stopping slave labor products from 
China coming into America will under-
mine ‘‘the White House’s climate agen-
da’’ and, unfortunately, ‘‘limit solar 
panel imports from China.’’ 
Presidential climate envoy John Kerry, 
among others, has been lobbying House 
members against the bill. 
Wow. Wow. That is remarkable. Why 
would he do that? Why would he do 
that? Someone needs to ask John 
Kerry that. That is just one example. 
Something about John Kerry—always 
in the mix undermining American in-
terests. 
This is an article from the Wash-
ington Post just about a month ago: 
‘‘In advance of climate summit, ten-
sion among Biden aides on China pol-
icy.’’ In essence, it said John Kerry was 
in Beijing—a very dangerous propo-
sition, by the way; you want to talk 
about selling out American interests—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8897 
December 2, 2021 
and he was begging the Chinese to co-
operate on climate change, but they 
said they are not going to commence— 
I am reading from the Washington 
Post—cooperation 
until 
the 
United 
States tones it down on human rights, 
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and trade. 
So the Chinese are saying: Hey, we 
are not going to do anything on cli-
mate, John Kerry, unless you go tell 
the President to tone it down on Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, human rights—slave 
labor, probably. Dutifully, John Kerry 
came back to DC and delivered the 
message. It is all in the Washington 
Post right here, October 25. 
To their credit, Jake Sullivan and 
others were pretty furious, according 
to this article, about John Kerry un-
dermining U.S. interests. But, hey, 
there he goes again. Remarkable. I 
mean, whose side is this guy on? 
Let me give you another example. 
One of the great things that have hap-
pened in America over the last two dec-
ades is this incredible revolution in 
terms of American energy. For dec-
ades, it has been the bipartisan policy 
of every administration—pretty much 
every Senator—for America to become 
energy independent. Until the Biden 
administration came into office, we 
have achieved that. Again, every ad-
ministration 
since 
World 
War 
II, 
Democratic or Republican: Being en-
ergy-independent would be good for us. 
One of the ways we have done this is 
this incredible revolution in the pro-
duction of American natural gas. It has 
made us the leader in reducing global 
greenhouse gas emissions in the world, 
by far. Since 2005 to present, the 
United States has reduced emissions by 
almost 15 percent—more than any 
other major economy in the world. Chi-
na’s emissions have gone like this. 
So you would think the export of 
American LNG all around the world, 
which is happening, would be great for 
our workers—it is; great for our na-
tional security—it is; and really good 
for the environment—it is. In fact, we 
are even exporting to India and China. 
That will help them reduce emissions. 
This is a win, win, win, win, win. 
So imagine my surprise when I met 
with foreign officials—I won’t name 
them—who have said to me: John 
Kerry is telling us in our country, in 
Asia and in Europe, don’t buy Amer-
ican natural gas. 
What? 
Don’t buy American natural gas. 
Why? 
I don’t know. 
But there he goes again, undermining 
U.S. interests, undermining American 
workers, and, by the way, undermining 
the global environment on that one. If 
you don’t buy American natural gas, 
you are going to be producing coal in 
China. 
This is what I have heard. 
And then let me give you one more. 
I came on the floor several months ago, 
only about 5 months ago, and called for 
the resignation of John Kerry after the 
interview of his friend the Foreign 
Minister of Iran, the largest state spon-
sor of terrorism, Foreign Minister 
Zarif, who was recorded in an interview 
that was leaked that said John Kerry 
told him a couple years ago, when Zarif 
was the Iranian Foreign Minister, 
about covert Israeli actions against 
Israeli interests in Syria. 
Now, think about that. According to 
news reports, Zarif is heard saying— 
and we all heard the video—‘‘It was 
former US. . . . Secretary John Kerry 
who told me Israel had launched more 
than 200 attacks on Iranian forces in 
Syria,’’ selling out and betraying our 
biggest ally in the Middle East, Israel. 
There 
is 
something 
about 
John 
Kerry, and every time that guy goes on 
a mission, you can be assured that 
American national security interests 
are being undermined. So here is a 
Christmas present I think the whole 
country would benefit from. For the 
good of this country, this former Sec-
retary of State, former U.S. Senator, 
needs to ride off into the sunset in his 
private jet and retire, or resign, or 
maybe the President can just fire him. 
We don’t need him to undermine Amer-
ican interests anymore.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I also 
originally planned to come to the floor 
this afternoon to ask unanimous con-
sent to support the nomination of 
Mark Gitenstein to be U.S. Ambas-
sador to the European Union. 
Mark is a qualified candidate to rep-
resent the United States with our most 
important trade and security relation-
ship. He has already served our Nation 
as U.S. Ambassador to Romania. He is 
deeply familiar with the geostrategic 
needs of our Central and European al-
lies, and he has spent over 25 years 
working on energy issues. This experi-
ence is going to be critically important 
in 
responding 
to 
Russia’s 
weaponization of gas flows to Europe. 
As the United States confronts the 
challenges around the world, we need 
to convey our firm commitment to our 
partners and our alliances. 
Now, unfortunately, I am not going 
to be able to move forward with this 
unanimous consent request because our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
can’t seem to muster anyone to come 
down and object to my unanimous con-
sent request. 
It is hard for me to understand why 
they 
have 
an 
objection 
to 
Mr. 
Gitenstein when they are not even will-
ing to come to object, and we know 
they are here. 
His confirmation would be important 
to advance our bilateral conversations 
on shared national security interests, 
such as this week’s dialogue between 
the United States and the EU on China. 
But for these conversations to make 
meaningful progress in addressing our 
national security interests, we need 
our diplomats and State Department 
officials at the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8898 
December 2, 2021 
I had the privilege of leading a bipar-
tisan delegation to the Halifax Secu-
rity Forum 2 weeks ago. We had three 
Republicans and three Democrats. 
One of the things we heard from our 
allies was that there was a real impact 
by having a lack of ambassadorial con-
firmations in countries, particularly in 
our ally countries. In the absence of 
U.S. representation, they are really 
questioning our commitment to our bi-
lateral relationship. 
In addition to Mr. Gitenstein, there 
are over 50 other State Department 
nominees waiting confirmation on the 
floor. 
Now, if our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle really shared the con-
cerns about Russia and China’s grow-
ing malign influence in the world that 
threatens the values we have fought so 
hard to advance, they would lift those 
holds without delay. They would un-
derstand that it is important for our 
national security to have Ambassadors 
in these critical posts around the 
world. 
I am deeply disappointed that our 
Republican colleagues have opposed 
the confirmation of Mr. Gitenstein’s 
appointment to the European Union, 
and I find it strange that at a time 
when we should be swiftly confirming 
our Ambassadors so that we can engage 
with our allies and address challenges 
like China and Russia, that what we 
are hearing from our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle is they want to 
hamstring our national security and 
play into the hands of our adversaries. 
Now, I understand that some of my 
Republican colleagues have decided to 
hold up dozens of ambassadorial nomi-
nees because of this administration’s 
handling of Nord Stream 2. I don’t 
think I need to remind anybody that I 
have long been opposed to Nord Stream 
2. But this opposition is precisely the 
reason that we should be appointing an 
ambassador to the European Union be-
cause without an ambassador, we have 
been absent in critical conversations 
on sanctions, on trade, on security, and 
on energy. And without an ambassador, 
we are limited in our ability to push 
for further sanctions to address Rus-
sian aggression, especially with our 
European allies. 
Without an ambassador, we can’t ef-
fectively engage our allies. We are ac-
tively playing into Putin’s hands by 
creating opportunities to sow division 
and discord within the transatlantic 
community. 
Partisan politics should end at the 
water’s edge, as it has for decades in 
the United States. I urge those few Re-
publicans on the other side of the aisle 
who are holding things up to stop this 
needless obstruction. 
The U.S. is stronger and safer when 
our diplomatic corps—those individ-
uals who support Americans and U.S. 
foreign policy around the world—are 
supported by capable, Senate-vetted, 
and confirmed Ambassadors. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. 
KAINE. 
Mr. 
President, 
Par-
liamentary inquiry. This is impromptu 
because I wasn’t aware of this until the 
Senator from New Hampshire just 
spoke. 
Is it the case that a Senator making 
a live UC on the floor to advance a 
nomination can be blocked from mak-
ing a live UC by someone who will not 
even agree to appear on the floor of the 
Senate? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a 
courtesy between Senators. 
Mr. KAINE. I have learned something 
new about the Senate rules that I wish 
I did not know. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, for the 
record, I would object on behalf of any-
one who is not here, and so the ques-
tion is moot. 
If the Democrats really wanted all 
these nominees to go forward, maybe 
you should talk to the President about 
the fact that he caved in on Nord 
Stream 2 sanctions. 
I know the Senator from New Hamp-
shire has been strong on that, but she 
could have stopped any single bill or 
nominee going forward by insisting 
that the President impose Nord Stream 
2 sanctions. 
Now we are in a situation where all 
of Western Europe is hooked on Ger-
man gas and Vladimir Putin is about 
to invade Ukraine, and the best we can 
get is stern words. 
So, yes, I would object on behalf of 
any Senator who is not present, and I 
don’t even know what I am objecting 
to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, just 
to respond to Senator COTTON—and I 
know that he shares my view about 
Nord Stream 2. But I think, sadly, at 
this point we are in a position where, 
by refusing to allow our diplomats to 
be in place, we no longer have an abil-
ity to negotiate. 
And, in fact, the gas has not started 
running in Nord Stream 2; the certifi-
cation of that pipeline has been de-
layed; and we have a new administra-
tion in Germany that we have heard a 
number of members of that administra-
tion express serious reservations about 
Nord Stream 2. 
So I am not sure that right now— 
given the need for transatlantic unity, 
the need for us to be able to work with 
our European allies on whatever Russia 
might do on Ukraine—is the best time 
for us to send a signal that we don’t 
really care what the administration is 
doing on this issue and we don’t really 
care what the Germans say about it, 
all we care about is making a point on 
Nord Stream 2, when what we really 
need to be doing is working together 
with our European allies because what 
Putin wants more than anything else is 
to sow dissension between the United 
States and our European allies. And, 
by this action, he is doing exactly that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. 
COTTON. 
Mr. 
President, 
8 
months—for 8 months any Senate Dem-
ocrat could have stepped forward and 
demanded the President impose Nord 
Stream 2 sanctions. For 4 years—for 4 
years—we stood together and cast 
votes—with 85 votes, 90 votes, or 95 
votes—in defense of Nord Stream 2 
sanctions when the Democrats were 
discovering their inner Jack Ryan 
when it came to Russia. 
But now that Donald Trump is gone 
from office and Joe Biden is in office 
and he is appeasing Vladimir Putin at 
every turn by extending the New 
START Treaty and by not imposing 
sanctions on Nord Stream 2, suddenly 
the Democrats have reverted back to 
their old, conciliatory ways toward 
Russia. 
The simplest way to deter invasion of 
Ukraine, the simplest way to deter 
Russian aggression is to draw clear red 
lines of enforcement—something that 
Joe Biden will not do; something that, 
apparently, the Democratic Senators 
will not force him to do. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I just 
have to take real umbrage at your sug-
gestion, Senator COTTON. 
I am the one who Vladimir Putin re-
fused a visa to get into Russia because 
of my opposition to Russia and to what 
Putin was doing. He didn’t deny you a 
visa to get into the country. So don’t 
talk to me about how I have not been 
tough enough on Russia because that 
dog won’t hunt. 
The fact is, during the Trump admin-
istration, he spent 4 years before he 
would sanction Nord Stream 2. Finally, 
right before he left office, he put sanc-
tions on. 
The only reason the western compa-
nies that were working on Nord Stream 
2 stopped their work is because of the 
threat of sanctions, not because Trump 
did anything to enforce those sanc-
tions. 
So there is plenty of blame to go 
around, and it doesn’t help for you or 
me or anybody else to start throwing 
personal insults over what is going on 
around Nord Stream 2. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I did not 
make any personal insult. I simply ob-
served that, for 4 years under the 
Trump administration, we repeatedly 
took action on a bipartisan basis to try 
to stop Nord Stream 2. 
One of the reasons we didn’t have a 
vote on amendments last week on the 
Defense bill is because the Democrats 
were carrying water for the Biden ad-
ministration, refusing to have a vote 
on Nord Stream 2. And that is con-
sistent with the Biden administration’s 
record on Russia, which can get all 
chesty in its rhetoric but always ap-
peases Vladimir Putin. 
One of the first actions he took was 
to give a no-strings-attached extension 
to the New START Treaty, something 
that Donald Trump never did—the very 
first priority of Vladimir Putin. 
The second priority was Nord Stream 
2. We have been trying to have votes in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8899 
December 2, 2021 
this Senate all year long, and we 
haven’t had them because the Demo-
crats won’t insist on a vote because 
Joe Biden doesn’t want it. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3299 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
have a problem in our Air National 
Guard right now. 
This body knows full well where I 
have been on vaccine mandates coming 
down from the President. I have ada-
mantly opposed the vaccine mandates 
on private-sector employees, which I 
find absurd that the President is an-
nouncing to every company with 100 
people or more: I am going to take over 
the contracts for employment in your 
company; and no matter how long that 
employee has been there and how valu-
able they are to the company, you need 
to fire them if they don’t follow the 
vaccine mandate. 
That is not the right of a President. 
It has formed chaos in our Federal 
workers. It has formed chaos in our 
contractors for Federal employees. 
Now, let me tell you what is hap-
pening in the National Guard right 
now. Tuesday of this week, November 
30, the Secretary of Defense sent out a 
letter saying that, by today, December 
2, every person in the National Guard 
had to be vaccinated or they would no 
longer be paid. 
Now, that applied to the Air National 
Guard as of today; but to the Army Na-
tional Guard, that doesn’t apply until 
June 30. Let me run this past this body 
again. If you are in the Air National 
Guard and you are not vaccinated by 
today, you won’t be paid anymore. You 
also can’t show up at drill this week-
end. You can’t go into any training at 
all, as of this weekend. But if you are 
in the Army National Guard, you have 
until June 30 to be able to fulfill this 
mandate. 
Now, I have been clear I am ada-
mantly opposed to the mandate, pe-
riod. But to then make it unequal be-
tween the Air National Guard and the 
Army National Guard is even worse. 
And on top of all of that, what the 
administration did as of this week— 
they sent out information for the Air 
National Guard members and, I as-
sume, for the Army National Guard 
starting in June that this is going to be 
a different process. 
Title 32 is the authority for the Na-
tional Guard. Now, for folks who aren’t 
following this or the folks in this body 
who do, some people get confused be-
tween the Reserves and the Guard. 
They are not the same. The Reserves 
are like Active Duty. The Guard actu-
ally work for the Governor of each 
State. 
Each State has accountability for the 
Guard members, and there is a respon-
sibility to make sure they are trained 
and ready and equipped for Federal 
service if they are called up for Federal 
service. But when they are under what 
is called title 32 authority, they work 
for the Governor of the State. If a unit 
is not prepared, the State is punished 
for their lack of preparation. So funds 
can be taken away from the State but 
not going down to individual members 
of the Guard. 
What did the Pentagon do this week? 
The Pentagon, this week, announced 
that not only are they not going to pay 
individual members, but they are lit-
erally reaching down into a unit, iden-
tifying members that have not received 
the vaccine, and they are not going to 
pay that person. 
There is no authority in law for the 
Pentagon to do that. In fact, that issue 
was debated in this body several years 
ago, and this body voted no on that. 
The Pentagon does not have the au-
thority to reach into the Governor’s 
National Guard and determine who will 
be paid and who will not be paid in the 
National Guard, but that is exactly 
what the President is trying to do and 
what the Pentagon is trying to do. 
Why is this a big issue? 
Because the Air National Guard, as 
of tomorrow, that are not vaccinated 
will not be paid, and this weekend they 
cannot go to drill. 
Why is that a big issue? 
Many of the folks in the Air National 
Guard that are not vaccinated are the 
pilots. 
Listen, if we are going to talk about 
military readiness, I understand the 
differences of opinion here in the vac-
cine mandates. And some people have 
no issue with the vaccine mandates. I 
do. But we should all agree on military 
readiness. We should all agree on fol-
lowing the law and not allowing the 
Pentagon and the President to delib-
erately violate the law that we wrote 
and the President has signed in vio-
lating title 32. 
Last night, I was on this very same 
floor, at this very same desk, asking 
for amendment on the NDAA. Today, I 
understand I am not getting that 
amendment on the NDAA. I have taken 
that same amendment and I have 
moved it into language that we can use 
as a standalone bill. 
This is a very simple, straight-
forward, no issues, no ancillary any-
thing on the bill. It simply says that 
we cannot allow the administration or 
the Pentagon—any one of them—to 
violate the law, to be able to reach into 
a National Guard unit and identify in-
dividual members and not pay them. 
That is already the law. We are just 
affirming the law that already is. 
And the second thing is not allowing 
them to be able to cut off pay based on 
their vaccination status in the Na-
tional Guard when they are in title 32 
status. That means they are working 
for the Governor of that State; they 
have not been activated to Federal 
duty. 
This is a big issue, and it is a big 
issue right now because the Air Na-
tional Guard members and many of our 
pilots are about to stop training right 
now. And in the days ahead for the 
Army National Guard, I remind this 
body of a number that most of us 
know. Only 40 percent of our Guard 
members are vaccinated, meaning 60 
percent are not. 
Are we really ready to lose that 
much readiness over this issue? 
I would hope not. 
So, as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to immediate consideration of 
Calendar No. 174, S. 3299. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving 
my right to object, the Senator from 
Oklahoma, as he always does, has very 
thoughtfully identified a problem that 
is affecting our military forces. And he 
has also identified the complex inter-
play between different aspects of the 
law: article 32, article 10, the authority 
of the Governor, the authority of the 
Secretary of Defense, legislation we 
might have passed. 
This is an issue that, I think, bears 
close scrutiny, and I would like to as-
sist in such scrutiny. But in terms of 
preemptively adopting a statute to-
night without such scrutiny, I would be 
compelled to object. 
So, Mr. President, with all due re-
spect to the Senator from Oklahoma, I 
would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
look forward to working with Senator 
REED on this. He has been a good part-
ner dealing with this. He is passionate 
about protecting our military and 
keeping our forces ready. 
I very much appreciate his partner-
ship in that, and I look forward to our 
ongoing dialogue on this. I have had 
multiple phone calls to leadership in 
the Pentagon and leadership in the Na-
tional Guard. I am not getting clear 
answers on this. 
As I have tried to be an advocate for 
the members of our Air National 
Guard, I want to be able to make sure 
that we provide them that opportunity 
to be able to serve and that we don’t 
lose access to readiness. So I very 
much appreciate his partnership in 
that. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. President, it is my understanding 
that in a short period of time we will 
be voting on the continuing resolution. 
The continuing resolution has now 
been passed in the House. It has been 
delivered over to the Senate. This 
maintains our government operations 
for the next 2 months. 
I have been a person who has ex-
pressed my frustration that we have 
not taken up the vast majority of the 
appropriations 
bills, 
even 
in 
com-
mittee. It is my understanding that 
even as of today, 9 of the 12 appropria-
tions bills have not even been discussed 
in committee, and all 12 of those bills

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8900 
December 2, 2021 
should have been done by September 
30. We are now well past that now. 
On September 30, we passed a con-
tinuing resolution that went until to-
morrow. Now we are passing another 
one that is going to go into February. 
As I read through it, as it just came 
over from the House of Representa-
tives, 
and 
was 
scanning 
quickly 
through it when they actually released 
the language in it this morning, I was 
interested to be able to see a couple of 
things that popped out to me in par-
ticular, serving on the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee. Serving that position 
in Homeland Security and some of the 
issues that we deal with on a day-to- 
day basis on oversight, I was fascinated 
to see two particular areas that popped 
out to me in this. One of them was 
dealing with unaccompanied minors. 
The administration earlier this year 
took some of the COVID money that 
had been allocated in March and used 
that COVID money to deal with unac-
companied minors. We have yet to get 
a full accounting of how much that 
was. But then when the continuing res-
olution was passed just September 30, 
2.5 billion with a ‘‘b’’—2.5 billion addi-
tional dollars were allocated just to 
deal with the surge of unaccompanied 
minors for this year. 
Well, that was a few months ago now. 
This continuing resolution is allo-
cating another $1.5 billion to unaccom-
panied minors. So they took we don’t 
know how much money of the COVID 
money for unaccompanied minors, and 
then if this bill passes tonight, which I 
assume it will at this point, it is an-
other $4 billion just on the unaccom-
panied minors. Let me remind you how 
large of a figure that is, an additional 
$4 billion. 
Before we lose track of that, what 
jumped out at me first when I went 
through this was a surprising number. 
In the continuing resolution that just 
came over from the House just minutes 
ago, there is a request for an additional 
$7 billion for Afghan refugees. When 
you say ‘‘OK, I understand,’’ in the 
September 30 continuing resolution, 
there was $6 billion for Afghan refugees 
over there. That is $13 billion for Af-
ghan refugees. The best that we can 
tell, we have 69,000 Afghan refugees 
who are in the process, and we are allo-
cating $13 billion for it. 
Now, we all thought—and we had the 
conversation here—that $6 billion that 
was allocated was an enormous amount 
of money that was allocated, but now, 
3 months after the refugees started 
being able to move out of Afghanistan 
in that debacle of a withdrawal that 
happened, now we are talking about 
not $6 billion but $13 billion. That is 
around $200,000 per person so far. 
If that was not bad enough, in the 
continuing resolution done September 
30, because of the enormous size of this 
amount of money and because of how 
little information has actually come to 
this body, there was a demand in it 
that by November 30—that was 2 days 
ago—the Department of Homeland Se-
curity would have to turn over a report 
of actually what is happening with the 
Afghan refugees. Has anyone in this 
body read that report from DHS now on 
how they are handling the Afghan refu-
gees? I would go ahead and preemp-
tively answer no because none of us 
have seen the report yet. 
Here is what we don’t know but yet 
this body demanded in the last CR to 
be able to get from DHS. We demanded 
to know crazy things like this: the 
number of lawful U.S. permanent resi-
dents who were evacuated out of Af-
ghanistan. We don’t have that number 
yet. We don’t know how many were 
special immigrant visa holders. We 
don’t know how many were actually 
applicants for special immigrant visas. 
We don’t know the number that had 
any other immigrant status. We don’t 
know the number who actually worked 
for our government who were actually 
evacuated. We have not been told al-
though we demanded to have it by No-
vember 30. 
We don’t know the number of people 
who work for a partner government or 
any other entity that we were affili-
ated with although we asked for that. 
We don’t know the number of people 
who actually came through the process 
and then were later determined to be 
security threats to the United States 
and had slipped through the process. 
We asked for that. We asked for that to 
come in by November 30. That has not 
been turned over. 
We asked for the number of people 
who were getting paroled and their pa-
role was then terminated because of 
some other criminal activity or some-
thing else. We asked for that. That is a 
number they have. They have not 
turned that number over. 
We asked for even the number of 
interviews that had been conducted. 
We have yet to receive that. In fact, 
there has not been a single public hear-
ing in the Senate on Afghan refugees— 
not one. So not only have we not re-
ceived anything in writing, we have 
not even received any testimony from 
anyone from DHS on this. 
Listen, we gave DHS $6 billion and 
said: We are going to allocate this 
money to you. We just want to know 
who we are allocating it to and what it 
is going to be used for. 
That doesn’t seem unreasonable. But 
not only is this body not holding DHS 
accountable for not answering our 
questions, we are handing them $7 bil-
lion more tonight. Does anyone else see 
this as an issue? 
I am all for keeping the government 
open, but this body has a responsibility 
of oversight. We have pretended we are 
doing oversight, but we are actually 
not doing oversight—not a hearing, not 
a report, nothing. Thirteen billion dol-
lars. 
So, yes, I am going to oppose the CR 
tonight. I am not holding up the vote. 
I understand full well the responsi-
bility of all 100 of us to put ourselves 
on the record. But if we are going to 
actually say we are going to do over-
sight, let’s actually do oversight. 
It is not unreasonable, when we all 
agree these are the facts and figures 
that should come from DHS to just tell 
us what is going on with the Afghan 
refugees, that we actually expect they 
are going to turn those things over. 
So in the days ahead, I hope we will 
actually hold a hearing and actually 
get the facts. I hope we will actually 
demand that they turn over to us what 
we have required, and I hope we get a 
full accounting of how they are spend-
ing $13 billion on what we understand 
were 69,000 people, most of whom have 
not even been moved in and across the 
United States yet—$13 billion. 
With that, I yield floor.

nomination 
of 
C.B. 
Sullenberger III, of Texas, for the rank 
of Ambassador during his tenure of 
service as Representative of the United 
States of America on the Council of the 
International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the nomination. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate vote on the 
nomination without intervening action 
or debate and that if confirmed, the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table, all with-
out intervening action or debate; that 
no further motions be in order to the 
nomination; that any statements re-
lated to the nomination be printed in 
the RECORD; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Sullenberger 
nomination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my 
hope that soon the Senate might be 
able to vote on a bipartisan agreement 
to keep the government open and fund-
ed through February 18. 
I know both parties are working on 
that agreement right now. I wish those 
who are doing it good luck. I have cer-
tainly been working hard with the Ap-
propriations Committee to help on that 
as have others. In fact, the only thing

worse than running the government 
under a continuing resolution, a CR, is 
a government shutdown. A shutdown 
only hurts the American people. We 
know last time we had one, it wasted 
billions in taxpayer dollars. 
And with the agreement that I an-
ticipate, I am glad that the bill will in-
clude critical funding to support Af-
ghan refugees as we help them get re-
settled here in the United States. 
These brave women and men were our 
allies through 20 years of war. We have 
an obligation to support them as they 
begin their new lives. 
I am not giving this speech as some 
kind of a victory lap. We are 2 months 
into the fiscal year, and we appear no 
closer to getting an agreement on full- 
year appropriations bills. 
Now, if we vote on this, which I hope 
we will soon, we are buying time to 
complete these negotiations, and we 
have to complete these negotiations. It 
is not a matter of whether we should; 
we have to. But in order to complete 
these negotiations, we have to begin 
them. We have to have both sides rep-
resented at the table. My Republican 
colleagues, to this day, have not come 
to the table. I have been talking to 
many of them, and I am hoping they 
will because the American people de-
serve better than that from their elect-
ed officials. They expect to see both 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
sitting 
down negotiating—no matter how we 
vote in the end, that we are working on 
coming to something that will be voted 
on. 
On October 18, nearly a month and a 
half ago, Senate Democrats released a 
comprehensive offer in an effort to 
jump-start 
these 
negotiations. 
We 
wanted to let all Senators—both par-
ties but especially our Republican col-
leagues and the American people— 
know our values. Since then, it has 
been very, very quiet. We haven’t heard 
any response. 
Let me tell you about our offer. I be-
lieve the offer was fair. I talked with 
Senators across the political spectrum. 
We provided a 5-percent increase for 
defense programs compared to last fis-
cal year and a 13-percent increase for 
all other programs. I took that 5 per-
cent because it is exactly the amount 
passed by a 25-to-1 vote by the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. It cer-
tainly is significantly higher than the 
1.7-percent increase for defense pro-
posed by the Biden administration, and 
the amount is lower than the 16 per-
cent the administration proposed for 
nondefense programs, even though I 
would like that 16 percent. But it is 
called compromise. We took from one; 
we gave to the other. It is compromise. 
It is how you get things done. Nobody 
gets every single thing they want, even 
if you are chairman of the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee. 
As I mentioned earlier, the 5 percent 
wasn’t something I picked out of thin 
air. It was the exact amount contained 
in the fiscal year 2022 National Defense 
Authorization Act, NDAA, that is be-
fore the Senate this week and again re-
ported from the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. I think it was 24 to 1, but 
it was overwhelming. 
The work on that bill has fallen due 
to Republican obstructionism over a 
series of amendments. To be clear 
though, none of the amendments Re-
publicans are fighting for on the NDAA 
would increase total spending in the 
bill. That is because the 5-percent in-
crease has bipartisan, bicameral sup-
port—Republicans and Democrats, both 
in the House and the Senate. That is 
the percentage they agreed to. Repub-
licans unanimously endorsed the 5-per-
cent increase when the NDAA was 
marked up in the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee. And the 5-percent in-
crease passed overwhelmingly in the 
House when they considered the NDAA 
over 2 months ago. 
I have been here for 47 years. This is 
as close to consensus as we can get— 
unanimous and near-unanimous votes. 
So I have to ask, why not take yes for 
an answer? If I was a cynical person, I 
would think this delay was deliberate. 
If I was a cynical person, I would think 
this delay was meant to drive us into a 
full-year continuing resolution. If I was 
a cynical person, I would think that be-
cause some in the Republican Party 
have even expressed this desire out 
loud. 
But for a party that claims to care 
about our Nation’s defense, I suggest 
they do the math. A full-year CR would 
not only reduce defense spending in-
stead of increasing it, it would reduce 
it by $37 billion compared to the levels 
set forth in the NDAA that they voted 
for unanimously. Actually, it would 
cut defense spending below last year’s 
level. 
So stop the hyperbole. Stop the rhet-
oric. Deal with the reality. I have to 
ask those Republicans who are advo-
cating for a full-year CR is their sup-
port for our Nation’s security merely 
political theater? I hope not because 
what they are asking for is a tremen-
dous cut in defense, not an increase. 
But also I look at the nondefense 
area. The impact a full-year CR would 
have on American families in all cor-
ners of this country is equally unthink-
able. Housing, education, childcare, 
critical 
healthcare 
programs—every 
one of these are at risk under a full- 
year continuing resolution. I can’t pos-
sibly imagine that any Senator of ei-
ther party is going to go home and say: 
Oh, I support huge cuts in housing, 
education, 
childcare, 
critical 
healthcare programs. I cannot possibly 
believe that is an outcome the other 
side would endorse, but that is what 
they are asking for in a CR. 
Every week, it seems I receive letters 
from advocacy groups and industry as-
sociations—both those normally asso-
ciated with Republican positions and 
those normally associated with Demo-
cratic positions—and they all say the 
same thing. They detail the problems 
that would come from the full-year CR 
and ask us to do our job and enact full- 
year bills. Among those, they include 
the National Defense Industrial Asso-
ciation, the Aerospace Industries Asso-
ciation, numerous veterans groups—all 
groups we say we support. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that four of these letters be print-
ed in the RECORD at the end of my re-
marks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. These four letters and 
others expressing concern can be found 
online 
at 
https:// 
www.appropriations.senate.gov/ 
download/advocacy-and-industry- 
group-letters. 
Let me be clear. Refusing to come to 
the negotiating table undermines na-
tional security and inhibits our ability 
to invest in American families, im-
pedes our capability to respond to the 
coronavirus and what we now see as 
emerging variants—which I am sure 
the Presiding Officer hears in his 
State, I hear in my State, and I guar-
antee you in the other 48 States, every 
Senator is hearing about that concern. 
But also there are 100 of us. We are 
elected to represent the whole country, 
325 million Americans. We are elected 
to do our job. If we don’t do it, it is ir-
responsible. That is the reason we are 
here today kicking the can down the 
road another 2 months. 
Let’s stand and vote yes or no on 
these issues. We have a job to do. The 
bill we will soon vote on, which I ex-
pect will be coming over soon from the 
House, gives us roughly 2 months to do 
it, and that is plenty of time. 
But I would ask the Republican lead-
ership to step up and engage, and I 
hope they will do it in the next few 
weeks. 
I am prepared any day—any day, any 
weekend, any evening, any morning, 
whenever—if we could do this. Other-
wise, we are going to be back here Feb-
ruary 18, and the American people, no 
matter what party they belong to, are 
going to say: What are you folks doing? 
Where is this legislation? 
So when the bill comes over, I urge 
my colleagues to vote aye on the bill, 
but I urge my Republican colleagues to 
work with me and with the House to 
ensure that we do not have to pass an-
other one in February. 
I have talked with Members of the 
Republican Party and the Democratic 
Party. They will tell me privately they 
are willing to work, they want to work, 
and they want to get it done. I appre-
ciate that, but now is the time to step 
up and do it. I think we can. I hope we 
will. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

December 2, 2021 
the expedited completion of the defense ap-
propriation bill. While we applaud the bipar-
tisan effort to pass a continuing resolution 
(CR) and avoid a government shutdown, it is 
a poor stand-in for the full-year appropria-
tions desperately needed by our warfighters 
and those who provide them with the equip-
ment and services that enable their mission. 
We cannot stress enough the importance of 
the defense appropriations bill to our na-
tional security and to a healthy defense in-
dustrial base. The limbo caused under CRs 
wastes precious time and money our nation 
cannot recover. Delayed new starts and ini-
tiatives place a strain on companies and 
their workforce, particularly as they recali-
brate operations to a post-pandemic normal. 
Our nation’s competitors face no similar 
challenges putting us at a competitive dis-
advantage, particularly with emerging tech-
nologies, and place our supply chains at in-
creasing risk, something we cannot afford 
after the nearly two years of pandemic im-
pacts. 
Doing business with the Federal Govern-
ment is already hard. The tomes of regula-
tions, burdensome business requirements, 
sometimes Kafkaesque contracting and over-
sight procedures, and compressed margins 
have combined to drive businesses out of the 
defense sector with a net outflow of well over 
10,000 companies since 2011 and, as noted in 
our annual Vital Signs report, a halving of 
new entrants to the sector between fiscal 
2019 and fiscal 2020 alone. Add to that the un-
certainty of ‘‘if and when’’ a full-year de-
fense appropriations gets signed into law, 
more companies will reassess their participa-
tion in the defense industrial base. The ulti-
mate price of this is paid by our warfighters 
who will lose out on innovations and new ca-
pabilities not delivered. 
The inefficiencies caused by beginning 12 
of the last 13 fiscal years without full-year 
funding have cost the military services bil-
lions lost in inefficient expenditures and pro-
gram delays. Also, delayed contract starts 
challenge larger contractors while threaten 
the existence of smaller prime contractors 
and small businesses down the supply chain. 
The effect of that has a human face and a 
long-term impact. To execute a new-start 
contract, a company must recruit, hire, and 
train a workforce despite a tight labor mar-
ket and a shortage of workers with the re-
quired security clearance. Faced with a de-
layed start, that company must now choose 
between two bad options, either pay that 
workforce to stand idle or let those workers 
go-both of which could lead to contract or 
business failure and undelivered capabilities 
to our service members. 
With no full-year funding, we cannot afford 
to go too long without hampering readiness 
recovery efforts, delaying capabilities to our 
warfighters, and postponing investments in 
advanced technologies while allowing our de-
fense industrial base to erode. NDIA supports 
a bipartisan agreement on domestic and na-
tional security spending and encourages the 
adoption of a two-year budget to prevent an-
other year of budget instability and to pro-
vide the needed support to the Department 
of Defense for their critical missions. 
We appreciate your attention to this crit-
ical issue and look forward to working with 
your Committees moving forward. 
Very respectfully,

AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION, 
November 2, 2021. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER 
PELOSI, RANKING MEMBER MCCONNELL, AND 
RANKING
MEMBER
MCCARTHY: The United 
States aerospace and defense industries are 
an essential partner with the federal govern-
ment in an array of efforts vital to our econ-
omy and our national security. Each fall, 
that partnership is tested when those pro-
grams are slowed down or deferred by the use 
of multiple continuing resolutions (CR) to 
keep the government running. On behalf of 
our vital industries and our more than two 
million employees, the Aerospace Industries 
Association (AIA) strongly urges you to 
reach a near-term agreement on fiscal year 
2022 funding to avoid further CRs beyond De-
cember 3, 2021. 
Government watchdogs continue to docu-
ment the waste and unnecessary disruption 
that CRs cause to federal programs. Multiple 
agencies advised the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) in a 2021 report that 
longer CRs ‘‘contributed to distortions in 
agencies’ spending, adding to the rush to ob-
ligate funds late in the year before they ex-
pire.’’ The GAO determined that contracting 
officers working under a CR must continu-
ously align the period of performance under 
their contracts to the specific timeframe of 
a given CR, resulting in many unnecessary 
contract modifications during the year. Hir-
ing of new civilian staff is also delayed, mak-
ing it harder for agencies to meet their 
goals. The GAO notes that agencies apply 
creative workarounds in the first quarter of 
each fiscal year, because they assume that 
appropriations bills will not be in place by 
the beginning of the fiscal year. However, 
these effects become far more serious, and 
agency staff have fewer options, when CRs 
continue into the second quarter and beyond. 
The Department of Defense (DOD) is 
uniquely harmed under CRs because these 
bills typically prohibit DOD from starting 
new programs or activities or increasing any 
program’s production rate beyond that of the 
current fiscal year. Both ‘new starts’ and 
rate increases are critical for our national 
defense because our defense posture and 
threats are always evolving. As CRs extend 
to longer periods during the year, this is an 
increasing problem for which DOD seldom 
gets relief. DOD reported to the GAO that 
between FY10 and FY20, they had requested 
exceptions to CR language (called ‘‘anoma-
lies’’) 1,258 times and had only been granted 
three percent of those requests. Most of 
these requested relief from the prohibition 
on new starts and rate increases. We strong-
ly believe that, should Congress produce CRs 
extending into the second quarter of FY22, it 
should eliminate the prohibition on new 
starts and production rate increases. 
FY22 is the first year in a decade when dis-
cretionary spending levels have not been 
fixed in statute by the Budget Control Act. 
AIA has long argued that statutory caps are 
not needed because Congress and the admin-
istration are able to assess and address the 
needs of the nation more effectively, and 
with greater oversight, through the annual 
appropriations process. Last year, Congress 
enacted all 12 full year appropriations bills 
by December 27. If Congress fails to once 
again enact full-year appropriations bills, or 
continues running the government into 2022 
under continuing resolutions, it will send the 
wrong signal to the government’s partners, 
like those in our industry. We count on sta-
ble, reliable and adequate funding to support 
the critical capabilities that we provide for 
all Americans. 
Like other industries, COVID–19 took a se-
rious toll on our workforce and the thou-
sands of small- and medium-sized businesses 
along the supply chain that are at the heart 
of the aerospace and defense industries. More 
than ever, businesses across all industries 
need predictability and consistency. 
We again ask that you ensure that all gov-
ernment programs receive full Fiscal Year 
2022 funding on or before December 3, 2021. 
Sincerely, 
ERIC FANNING, 
President and CEO, Aerospace 
Industries Association. 
COALITION ON HUMAN NEEDS, 
November 24, 2021. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN LEAHY: On behalf of the 
Coalition on Human Needs, I am writing to 
strongly urge you to do everything in your 
power to enact omnibus FY 2022 appropria-
tions 
legislation 
including 
all 
12 
sub-
committee bills, and thank you for your 
leadership towards this end. Our nation 
badly needs the increased funding provided 
in the Senate and House Appropriations 
Committee bills. We face many increased 
needs, a great many exacerbated by the pan-
demic and its economic dislocations. For 
more than a decade, funding levels for vital 
human needs programs have shrunk, espe-
cially taking inflation into account. If Con-
gress fails to enact omnibus appropriations 
legislation and instead defaults to a long- 
term continuing resolution (CR) with flat 
funding, we will seriously damage our capac-
ity to respond to the multiple public health 
and economic crises we face. 
Members of the Coalition on Human Needs, 
including human service provider organiza-
tions, faith groups, labor, civil rights, policy 
experts and other advocates concerned with 
meeting the needs of people with low in-
comes, enthusiastically welcomed the fund-
ing levels provided in the Biden FY 2022 
budget and the House and Senate Appropria-
tions Committees. We have tracked nearly 
200 human needs programs over the past dec-
ade. Between FYs 2010 and 2020, we found 
that two-thirds of these programs, covering 
health care, housing, nutrition, social serv-
ices, education, training, and more, had lost 
ground, taking inflation into account. In the 
past year, we have begun to rebuild. But the 
needs are also growing. 
We now face rising prices affecting neces-
sities including utilities, food, and rent. Flat 
funding from a prolonged CR would fail our 
people by not providing needed increases in 
programs such as the Low Income Home En-
ergy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The 
Senate Labor-Health and Human Services- 
Education Subcommittee-introduced bill in-
creases funding by $175 million. This is too 
modest when taking into account that nat-
ural gas heating costs are projected to rise 
by 30 percent this winter and heating oil is 
expected to rise by 43 percent; flat funding 
would be wholly inadequate. Nutrition pro-
grams will also need funding increases be-
cause of rising food prices. The Senate 
Labor-HHS-Education 
Subcommittee 
pro-
posal includes $576 million for home-deliv-
ered meals for seniors, an increase of $300 
million above the FY 2021 enacted level. Re-
sponding to a serious increase in people ex-
periencing homelessness, the Senate Trans-
portation-Housing and Urban Development 
Subcommittee-introduced 
bill 
would 
in-
crease Homelessness Assistance programs to 
$3.26 billion, $260 million more than FY 2021. 
These funds would expand services for home-
less youth and people fleeing from domestic 
violence, and would provide additional per-
manent housing for chronically unhoused 
people. While the Senate Subcommittee bill 
would cover current rental voucher program 
costs, the House bill would expand rental as-
sistance to 125,000 additional households. 
These increases are vitally needed. For the 
first 11 months of this year, median one-bed-
room apartment rents rose 12.1 percent; for

two-bedroom units, the median increase was 
13.2 percent. In the previous two years, me-
dian rent increases were less than 1 percent. 
Flat funding for housing and homelessness 
programs would be simply unacceptable. 
We have for some time faced a substance 
use crisis, and have reached 100,000 deaths 
from opioid overdoses already this year, up 
from about 93,000 in 2020. The Senate funding 
level for the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 
is $9.1 billion, $3.1 billion more than funding 
in FY 2021. Without this substantial in-
crease, we will not be able to cope with the 
continuing rise in opioid addiction. 
The pandemic has markedly increased 
mental health problems. From August 2020 
to February 2021, the CDC reported an in-
crease in adults with anxiety or depressive 
disorders, from 36.4 percent to 41.5 percent, 
and reports rose of unmet mental health care 
needs. The proposed SAMHSA funding levels 
allow us to respond more adequately. The 
Senate Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee 
proposal would increase mental health serv-
ices overall to $2.97 billion, an increase of 
nearly $1.2 billion over FY 2021. In par-
ticular, the Senate Subcommittee bill more 
than doubles funding for the Mental Health 
Block Grant, to $1.58 billion for FY 2022. The 
House-passed funding for Labor-HHS-Edu-
cation makes a welcome increase in Chil-
dren’s Mental Health funding, stopping the 
inflation-driven erosion that caused a 14 per-
cent reduction from FY 2010 to FY 2020. We 
must not return to flat funding when the 
pandemic has adversely affected the mental 
health of millions of children and adults. 
Over the past decade, we allowed our pub-
lic health capacity to diminish, and as a con-
sequence we were not ready to cope with 
COVID–19. The Senate Labor-HHS-Education 
Subcommittee appropriations bill increases 
the Centers for Disease Control about $1.85 
billion over the current year, allowing for 
the agency to rebuild so that it can more ef-
fectively respond to COVID–19 and future 
health threats. 
We know our economy is hampered by a 
mismatch between jobs available and people 
with the skills to fill those positions. FY 2022 
appropriations proposals include increases in 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
programs (WIOA), YouthBuild, Registered 
Apprenticeships, and Reintegration of Ex-Of-
fender programs, as well as a new National 
Youth Employment Program. These will lead 
to jobs with higher pay and broadly shared 
economic growth. These increases are needed 
to overcome a ten-year 17 percent reduction 
in WIOA programs and to move us forward. 
There are too many important programs to 
list here. But we do wish to underscore that 
children have experienced many hardships 
during the pandemic, including unprece-
dented losses in education and alarming in-
creases in reports of households with chil-
dren sometimes or often not having enough 
to eat. The historic increases proposed in 
Title I K–12 education for students with low 
incomes and in special education funding are 
urgently needed to help children overcome 
the educational setbacks they have experi-
enced. Title I spending rises by at least $16.6 
billion over FY 2021, and there will be a $2.6 
billion increase in IDEA state grants for 
more than 7.6 million students with disabil-
ities. 
The FY 2022 appropriations bills drawn up 
in the House and/or Senate include many im-
portant funding increases to help families 
care for their children. Funding for the 
Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition 
program must accommodate an increase in 
benefits that was extended through the end 
of December in the current Continuing Reso-
lution, and must not be allowed to expire at 
that time. In addition to the mental health, 
housing, nutrition, and education funding al-
ready mentioned here, there are badly need-
ed increases in child care, Head Start, early 
learning programs, and child abuse preven-
tion and treatment programs. There are also 
urgently needed increases in funds to care 
for unaccompanied migrant children: at $4.9 
billion, a $3.6 billion increase over FY 2021 in 
the 
Senate 
Labor-HHS-Education 
Sub-
committee bill. 
The nation’s recovery depends on strength-
ening a host of domestic programs that have 
been allowed to shrink for years, not just to 
get to where they had been before, but to re-
spond to needs far greater because of the 
pandemic and its global economic disloca-
tions. A long-term continuing resolution 
would be a severe failure to address these 
needs. We strongly urge you to enact omni-
bus appropriations legislation including all 
twelve bills as soon as possible. 
Sincerely, 
DEBORAH WEINSTEIN, 
Executive Director. 
NOVEMBER 10, 2021. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND MI-
NORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: On behalf of the 
millions of veterans our organizations rep-
resent, we write to express serious concerns 
about reports that the Senate is considering 
approving a full-year continuing resolution 
to fund the federal government for the re-
mainder of fiscal year 2022, which would have 
significant negative consequences for vet-
erans, their families, caregivers and sur-
vivors. Therefore, we are asking that you 
work together to ensure that veterans pro-
grams, benefits and medical services receive 
the full level of funding for fiscal year 2022 
that was approved with strong bipartisan 
support (25 to 5) by the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee in August. 
As you know, Congress approved and the 
President signed a short-term continuing 
resolution (Public Law 117–43) on September 
30th to fund the federal government through 
December 3, 2021, extending funding at the 
levels previously enacted in fiscal year 2021 
appropriations legislation. Funding for De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical 
care and benefit payments for fiscal year 2022 
was previously approved in December 2020 as 
advance appropriations in Division J (Mili-
tary Construction and Veterans Affairs) of 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, 
Public Law 116–260. However, the advance ap-
propriations process only works properly if 
funding levels are adjusted to address in-
creased demand for benefits and services as 
part of the following year’s regular appro-
priations process, as is necessary for fiscal 
year 2022. Further, if Congress passes a full- 
year continuing resolution, all other pro-
grams, services and benefits would remain 
funded at fiscal year 2021 levels, which would 
fall short of the anticipated needs. 
For example, a full-year continuing resolu-
tion could result in an estimated $7 billion 
shortfall in funding for mandatory com-
pensation and pension benefits, in large part 
due to an increased number of benefit claims 
resulting from congressional approval of new 
diseases related to Agent Orange exposure 
for Vietnam veterans. 
In addition, the time it takes to process 
these and other claims for benefits would be 
significantly increased without the $300 mil-
lion increase for the Veterans Benefits Ad-
ministration approved by the Senate Appro-
priations Committee. Similarly, reductions 
from the Committee-approved levels for the 
Board of Veterans’ Appeals and the National 
Cemetery Administration would negatively 
impact veterans and their survivors seeking 
their services and benefits. 
Enacting a full-year continuing resolution 
would also negatively hamper veterans’ abil-
ity to receive timely medical care absent the 
$3.3 billion increase for Veterans Medical 
Community Care approved by the Senate 
Committee. VA’s critical Medical and Pros-
thetic Research programs would be cut by 
$67 million and funding to support VA’s 
health care infrastructure would be cut $450 
million below the levels approved by the 
Committee if Congress passes a full-year 
continuing resolution. 
As leaders of the Senate, we call on you to 
reject consideration of a full-year continuing 
resolution that would reduce veterans’ fund-
ing below what has already been approved in 
an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the Sen-
ate Appropriations Committee. Instead, we 
ask that you use your influence to ensure 
that the Senate completes consideration of 
the fiscal year 2022 appropriations so that 
veterans, their families, caregivers and sur-
vivors have timely access to all the benefits, 
services and medical care they have earned.

Without objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to announce that an agreement 
has been reached between Democrats 
and Republicans that will allow the 
Senate to take up and pass the con-
tinuing resolution to fund the govern-
ment through February 18. With this 
agreement, there will be no govern-
ment shutdown, and I appreciate the 
work of my colleagues from both sides 
of the aisle, including Leader MCCON-
NELL, to reach this point. The good, bi-
partisan 
work 
that 
produced 
this 
agreement will give appropriators in 
both parties and in both Chambers 
time to reach a comprehensive agree-
ment on appropriations by February 18 
of next year. 
I am glad that, in the end, cooler 
heads prevailed. The government will 
stay open. I thank the Members of this 
Chamber for walking us back from the 
brink of an avoidable, needless, and 
costly shutdown. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

GOVERNMENT FUNDING ACT 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-

the consideration of H.R. 6119, which 
the clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 6119) making further con-
tinuing appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2022, and for other pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

AMENDMENT NO. 4868 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, 45 million 
Americans, 45 million hard-working 
moms and dads, neighbors, and friends 
are being threatened right now with 
losing their jobs. They are being 
threatened not due to cyclical eco-
nomic conditions, not because jobs 
aren’t available, not because of some 
war or other calamity; their jobs are 
being threatened by their own govern-
ment—a government that has chosen 
to tell them if they don’t comply with 
a Presidential medical orthodoxy, they 
will be fired. 
This is unfortunate. This is most un-
fortunate. It is most unfortunate that 
this power has been exercised this way. 
The President doesn’t have that power. 
Congress hasn’t given the President 
that power. Congress doesn’t have that 
power to begin with. This is not a 
power that belongs in the Federal Gov-
ernment to begin with. 
As a result of that, 45 million Ameri-
cans are being threatened with their 
jobs. They are being forced to choose 
between an unwanted medical proce-
dure and losing their job. 
Look, I want to be very clear. I have 
been vaccinated. My family has been 
vaccinated. I believe the development 
of the vaccine is something of a mod-
ern medical miracle. I am grateful for 
the vaccine. I think the vaccine is help-
ing Americans be safe from the effects 
of COVID. It is not the government’s 
job. It is not within government’s au-
thority to tell people that they must 
be vaccinated, and if they don’t get 
vaccinated, they will get fired. 
It is wrong. It is immoral. You don’t 
tell someone that if they don’t do ex-
actly what you want them to do, that 
they are going to lose their job. The 
American 
people 
overwhelmingly 
agree. 
In fact, according to a recent Axios 
poll, only 14 percent of all Americans 
agree with the President of the United 
States that if someone declines to get 
the jab, they should lose their job. 
Now, this is a huge percentage of the 
workforce 
in 
many 
States—most 
States, in fact. Somewhere between a 
quarter and a third of all workers are 
now being faced with the possibility of 
losing their job because of these vac-
cine mandates. This, at a time when 
Americans are struggling just to put 
food on the table, in part, because we 
have a government that is spending too 
much money it doesn’t have. 
It is churning up money, printing it, 
in effect, in a way that results in ramp-
ant inflation; in a way that makes lim-
ited paychecks go less far, less capable 
of buying bread to put on the table. 
And amidst all of this government- 
manufactured crisis, government is 
making it worse; threatening to not 
just make that paycheck go even less 
far than it already does because of gov-
ernment but to take it away alto-
gether. That is not kind; that is not 
the neighborly way in which we like to 
do things; it is not moral; and it is not 
constitutional. 
Look, it is tragic that this many 
Americans have to have their jobs 
threatened as a result of a Presidential 
temper tantrum. There is nothing 
about it that is OK. Deep down, we all 
know that it is not OK. 
I will tell you, there is another thing 
that is not OK. It is not OK that those 
who want to take away those jobs, 
those who are just fine with the Presi-
dent exercising this authority fought 
tooth and nail to prevent the U.S. Sen-
ate from taking the vote that we are 
preparing to take tonight, a simple 
vote—a simple vote that simply allows 
us to weigh in and decide whether or 
not we are going to fund that part of 
government, that feature of our gov-
ernment that is going to enforce the 
vaccine mandate. 
Those in this Chamber who shame-
fully were refusing over and over again 
to let us even cast a vote on that sim-
ple measure threatened to shut down 
all of government because they didn’t 
want to have us have a chance, as the 
people’s elected lawmakers, to decide 
whether or not we should proceed with 
vaccine mandate enforcement. They 
would rather shut down the govern-
ment and make everything worse than 
they would stand accountable for what 
they are doing. 
Fortunately, this part of the story at 
least has a happy ending. We are going 
to be able to vote on that tonight. We 
are going to be able to vote on whether 
or not we fund vaccine mandate en-
forcement at the Federal level. 
This is wonderful. This is fantastic. 
It should not have resulted in days and 
days of shutdown threats and days and 
days of deflection, accusing other peo-
ple of wanting to shut down the gov-
ernment when all we wanted to do was 
have a vote, to give a chance to the 
hard-working mom or dad, soldier, sail-
or, airman, or marine struggling to put 
food on the table. That is all we want-
ed. And all they wanted to do is use it 
as an excuse to deflect onto others that 
which they are doing. 
We can do better than this. We must 
do better than this. The American peo-
ple deserve better than this. That is 
why I am so glad and grateful that we 
will be casting this vote tonight. 
But know this: This issue is not 
going away. I hope with everything in 
me that when we cast this vote to-
night, that a majority of us will do the 
right thing and that we will vote the 
way that we know we should vote; that 
we will stand with those people who 
may lose their jobs. Thirty-one percent 
of the workers in my State—and in 
other States, it is higher. Thirty-nine 
percent of the workers in West Virginia 
stand to lose their jobs, 37 percent of 
the workers in Alabama, 33 percent of 
the workers in Georgia. In State after 
State, you see hard-working moms and 
dads being threatened. 
This isn’t right. It is not even an au-
thority that the President has. It is not 
authority that the Congress has. We 
shouldn’t be doing this. Deep down, we 
all know that is right. We also know 
that some of these problems result 
from the fact that when we fund the 
government, we have made significant 
mistakes as a result of the fact we have 
allowed so many spending decisions to 
be concentrated in one vote on one bill,

such that all of government tends to be 
funded or none of it gets funded. 
Sometimes the only opportunity we 
have to weigh in on a particular matter 
of public policy, one affecting 45 mil-
lion American workers in this in-
stance—the only chance we have to do 
that is on a spending bill, and we don’t 
even get that chance unless we agree 
we can vote on an amendment on that. 
That should never result in a shutdown 
threat. 
When those threats are made, we 
should acknowledge who is making 
them. Never once has any one of us 
wanted to shut down the government. 
We wanted to give the American work-
er a chance for us to vote for them, a 
chance for us to stand with them. 
I urge—I implore—my colleagues: 
Please join me in voting to protect the 
American worker. Don’t take away the 
job of hard-working Americans. Don’t 
fire people because they are not in-
clined to adhere to Presidential med-
ical orthodoxy. Please support me in 
this amendment.

AMENDMENT NO. 4868 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
call up my amendment No. 4868 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Kansas [Mr. MARSHALL] 
for himself and for Mr. LEE, proposes an 
amendment numbered 4868. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit the use of Federal 
funds 
for 
implementing 
or 
enforcing 
COVID–19 vaccine mandates) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 
ll. 
PROHIBITION 
ON 
FUNDING 
FOR 
COVID–19 VACCINE MANDATES. 
None of the funds appropriated or other-
wise made available under this Act may be 
obligated or expended to— 
(1) implement or enforce— 
(A) section 1910.501 of title 29, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations (or a successor regulation); 
(B) Executive Order 14042 of September 9, 
2021 (86 Fed. Reg. 50985; relating to ensuring 
adequate COVID safety protocols for Federal 
contractors); 
(C) Executive Order 14043 of September 9, 
2021 (86 Fed. Reg. 50989; relating to requiring 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccination for 
Federal employees); 
(D) the interim final rule issued by the De-
partment of Health and Human Services on 
November 5, 2021, entitled ‘‘Medicare and 
Medicaid 
Programs; 
Omnibus 
COVID–19 
Health Care Staff Vaccination’’ (86 Fed. Reg. 
61555); or 
(E) the memorandum signed by the Sec-
retary of Defense on August 24, 2021, for 
‘‘Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vac-
cination of Department of Defense Service 
Members’’; or 
(2) promulgate, implement, or enforce any 
rule, regulation, or other agency statement, 
that is substantially similar to a regulation, 
Executive Order, rule, or memorandum de-
scribed in paragraph (1). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 6 minutes of debate equally 
divided prior to a vote on amendment 
No. 4868. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, this 
amendment is simple. It prohibits 
moneys from this bill to be used to 
fund or enforce the White House’s 
COVID vaccine mandates on the Amer-
ican people for the duration of the CR. 
As a physician, I have always sup-
ported the vaccine, and I encourage 
Americans to talk to their doctor 
about getting vaccinated and about the 
booster. But whether to receive the 
vaccine or not is a personal choice. It 
should not be mandated via unconsti-
tutional Executive actions that the ad-
ministration acknowledged earlier this 
year they didn’t have the authority to 
put in place. 
No precedent exists in American his-
tory for punishing private employers 
who don’t enforce government vaccine 
edicts. As we all know, multiple Fed-
eral courts have put a stop to the 
OSHA mandate, as well as the Federal 
contractor and CMS mandates. 
What is more, thank goodness, the 
White 
House 
even 
delayed 
imple-
menting their mandate for Federal 
workers until after the holidays. This 
is an opportunity to right a wrong—for 
each Member in this body to right a 
wrong. Let’s get employers certainty 
and employees peace of mind that they 
will still have a job this new year. 
Make no mistake, these vaccine man-
dates are not about public health or 
science. If they were, the White House 
would recognize the 92 percent of 
Americans—92 percent of Americans— 
who already built up immunity to this 
virus between vaccines and natural im-
munity. 
Beside me is a photo of upset union 
workers in Topeka, KS. These are peo-
ple who keep our electricity on and 
houses warm in the winter. These are 
hard-working Americans who put their 
lives on the line throughout the pan-
demic. Tonight, I am their voice. I am 
their voice and I am proud to be here 
to keep fighting for them, for their 
families, and their right to earn a liv-
ing in this greatest country in the 
world. 
Tonight, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in this fight and support our 
amendment and avoid an economic 
shutdown, avoid brownouts, further 
supply chain disruptions, labor short-
ages, higher inflation, and weakening 
our national security. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. 
MURRAY. 
Mr. 
President, 
COVID–19 has killed over 780,000 people 
in our country. This pandemic has a 
higher body count than any war we 
have ever fought in, and it is not over. 
We should be doing everything we 
can to stop this virus. We should be 
using every tool to keep America safe. 
We all know the damage this virus can 
do to our communities and to our econ-
omy. That is why the Biden adminis-
tration has taken steps to urge em-
ployers to make sure their employees 
are fully vaccinated or test negative 
for COVID–19 before they come to the 
workplace. That is a move that is wide-
ly popular with the American people. 
No one wants to go to work and be wor-
ried they might come home to their 
family with a deadly virus. 
Even businesses support this step. 
The Chamber of Commerce is urging 
businesses to comply with the adminis-
tration’s emergency temporary stand-
ard. Perhaps, more importantly, it is a 
move that will save lives. We have al-
ready seen these requirements have a 
huge impact. In fact, many businesses 
with vaccine requirements have seen 
vaccine rates rise well above 90 per-
cent. OSHA estimates that the Federal 
standard—which Republicans are fight-
ing to undermine—will help protect 84 
million workers, prevent thousands of 
deaths and over 200,000 hospitalizations 
from COVID–19. 
I do not understand why—after all 
families have been through, after all 
we have lost and all the hard work we 
have done to rebuild—would anyone 
want to throw that in jeopardy and 
throw away one of the strongest tools 
we have to get people vaccinated, keep 
them safe, and end this pandemic once 
and for all. It is senseless. It is reck-
less. I urge my colleagues to vote 
against it. 
I yield the rest of my time to the 
Senator from Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
support the position of my colleague. 
When you are unwilling to describe 
something accurately, it betrays a 
weakness in your position. I heard my 
colleagues complain about the vaccine 
mandate. It is not a vaccine mandate. 
It is a vaccine or testing mandate. If 
you don’t want to get a test—if you 
don’t want to get a vaccine, don’t get a 
vaccine. Get a test so you can go to 
work each week without infecting your 
colleagues with the deadly disease. 
What my colleagues are asking is 
that people be protected so that they 
can go to work with a deadly disease, 
infect coworkers, and still get a pay-
check—and still get a paycheck. If you 
don’t want to get a vaccine, get a test. 
If you are unwilling to protect your co-
workers, don’t demand a paycheck. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. If you don’t want to get the 
virus, get the vaccine. 
The answer to someone not agreeing 
to your medical advice is not to fire 
them. It sure as heck isn’t to have the 
President of the United States fine 
every 
employer 
in 
America 
that 
doesn’t want to do this, whether they 
have religious objections or otherwise. 
This is wrong. We know it is wrong. We 
can stop this right now. 
Please join me in opposing and tak-
ing down and refusing to fund for the 
duration of this continuing resolution 
that part of government charged with 
enforcing this immoral, indefensible, 
unconstitutional, and illegal mandate.

The bill was ordered to a third read-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There

the bill. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be 
very brief. 
I will note that, as chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee, this bill 
was negotiated on a bipartisan-bi-
cameral basis to keep the government 
open and operating until February 18. 
I urge every Member to vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
We have to pass it tonight, but I warn 
and remind every Senator: It is not a 
substitute for doing our work. We have 
to use the next 2 months to negotiate 
and 
enact 
full-year 
appropriations 
bills. I hope my Republican friends will 
come to the table to negotiate toplines. 
The Democrats have made a fair offer, 
a strong offer, and we need a response. 
So I thank Vice Chairman SHELBY for 
his cooperation and hard work on this 
bill. I look forward to working with 
him, as I did earlier today, and will 
continue to until we get an agreement 
on a topline and all 12 appropriations 
bills by February 18. 
Let’s get to work and show the coun-
try the Senate can do its work.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL RENETTE HILTON 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate and thank Air 
Force Lt. Col. Renette Hilton. Renette 
has been serving as a Department of 
Defense fellow in my office this year, 
and she has been an asset to the people 
of Arizona and the U.S. Congress. 
Arizona is home to key parts of the 
U.S. Air Force working every day to 
keep our Nation safe and secure. Luke 
Air Force Base is home to the world’s 
largest fighter wing, the 56th Fighter 
Wing, where they train on and operate 
the F–35 Lightning. The F–35 is Amer-
ica’s preeminent fifth-generation fight-
er. Luke Air Force Base also trains pi-
lots for our partner nations, strength-
ening or relationship with and the se-
curity of our allies. Davis-Monthan Air 
Force Base is similarly critical to our 
national security. Davis-Monthan has a 
diverse mission that includes search 
and rescue, Air Force Southern Com-
mand, electronic warfare, and the 
Aerospace Maintenance and Regenera-
tion Group. Arizona also has one of the 
most capable Air National Guard units 
in the country. They organize the busi-
est aerial refueling operation and con-
tinue to innovate to stay on the cut-
ting edge of Air Force capabilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8908 
December 2, 2021 
In the year she has worked in my of-
fice, Renette has become an essential 
member of the team and a valued con-
nection to the Air Force. She has 
worked with my policy team to host 
over 30 meetings with Arizona con-
stituents on a range of topics related 
to the Nation’s defense. She has as-
sisted 
in 
making 
informed 
rec-
ommendations on confirmation votes, 
cosponsorships, and hearing prepara-
tions. She has helped us draft thought-
ful and influential policy that I know 
will help the servicemembers and fami-
lies of Arizona. Renette has been a 
steadfast protector of Arizona military 
missions and communities. 
Moreover, Renette went above and 
beyond to adapt to dynamic staffing in 
my office. She led our defense team for 
several months, including coordinating 
with a legislative correspondent, policy 
aide, and our defense outreach team 
across three geographically dislocated 
offices. In this role, she planned, orga-
nized, and directed a staff delegation to 
multiple bases throughout Arizona and 
engaged with senior leaders in the 
military, as well as business, academic, 
and community stakeholders. She also 
successfully supported my requests to 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
I am incredibly proud of the work ac-
complished by Lieutenant Colonel Hil-
ton throughout this challenging year. 
She has set an outstanding example for 
others, and my team and I will miss 
her.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO BEN COOPER 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Mr. Ben Coo-
per, a lifelong resident of West Hart-
ford, CT, and outstanding World War II 
veteran who turns 100 on December 24, 
2021. 
Mr. Cooper was a freshman at The 
George Washington University when 
the United States entered World War 
II. Eager to support his country, he 
went to work at Colt’s Firearms in 
Connecticut, where he tested machine 
guns until he was drafted in September 
1942. Mr. Cooper was sent for training 
at Camp Barkeley. While on furlough, 
he met his future wife, Dorothy, and 
the two married when he received news 
he was going to be sent overseas. Mr. 
and Mrs. Cooper had four children and 
celebrated their 65th wedding anniver-
sary shortly before Dorothy passed. 
After boarding a liberty ship, Mr. 
Cooper was assigned as a combat medic 
to the U.S. Army’s 45th Infantry Divi-
sion, also known as the Thunderbird 
Division, which was largely comprised 
of Native American soldiers. They saw 
combat in Italy, France, and Germany. 
While in Europe, Mr. Cooper was in-
structed by his friends to keep his dog 
tags in his pocket rather than around 
his neck. They were labeled with an 
‘‘H’’ for Hebrew, indicating his Jewish 
faith, which could have led to harm if 
he were captured by the Germans. In 
April 1945, the 45th Infantry Division 
received orders to secure a camp. As 
Mr. Cooper explains, no one in the divi-
sion knew anything about the camp 
other than their instructions to not 
allow anyone to enter or exit. 
When Mr. Cooper and his division ar-
rived at Dachau in southern Germany, 
they witnessed scenes he describes as 
‘‘virtually unspeakable.’’ He met the 
survivors who were able to walk up to 
him and was traumatized by what he 
encountered. On April 29, 1945, the 
30,000 
prisoners 
were 
liberated 
by 
American troops, including Mr. Cooper 
and the 45th Infantry Division. In the 
following days, the division helped cap-
ture Munich. 
Though the division was sent to 
France with the expectation of fighting 
the Japanese, they were instead dis-
charged when the war ended before 
they made it to the Pacific. Mr. Cooper 
returned home to his family and did 
not speak about Dachau to anyone for 
45 years. 
In 1990, Mr. Cooper shared his story 
for the first time, speaking to a group 
of students. From there, he started to 
recount his experiences wherever it 
could be helpful. For over three dec-
ades, Mr. Cooper has spoken to schools, 
colleges, civic groups, and archival 
projects, repeating his eyewitness ac-
count to make sure the realities of the 
Holocaust are not forgotten. 
His speaking engagements have led 
to a number of remarkable events. At 
the annual Holocaust commemoration 
at the Connecticut State Capitol in 
1996, he met a man who revealed he and 
his wife were liberated from Dachau by 
Mr. Cooper and his division. They rec-
ognized the Thunderbird logo on his 
jacket. 
The 
two 
families 
became 
friends, and in 2006, their son per-
formed open heart surgery for Mr. Coo-
per, who mused, ‘‘what goes around 
comes around.’’ 
In 2017, Mr. Cooper was inducted into 
the 
Connecticut 
Veterans 
Hall 
of 
Fame, and in 2019, he received the Le-
gion d’honneur, France’s highest mili-
tary merit. That same year, I had the 
privilege of presenting Mr. Cooper with 
a certificate of special recognition at 
the Connecticut Veterans Memorial, 
where he also received the Connecticut 
Wartime Service Medal from the Con-
necticut Department of Veterans Af-
fairs. 
Mr. Cooper’s lifetime of service and 
advocacy serves as a model for all of 
us. On his business cards is the motto 
that guides him: ‘‘No act of kindness, 
no matter how small, is ever wasted.’’ 
Mr. Cooper’s courage and compassion 
will be an enduring legacy. I applaud 
his many accomplishments and hope 
my colleagues will join me in con-
gratulating Mr. Ben Cooper on this 
milestone of his 100th birthday.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO AVERY HERRMANN 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize a 
young Kansan who has truly gone 
above and beyond to help others, Ms. 
Avery Herrmann from Sabetha, KS. 
Avery has been making jewelry since 
2017 to help support the Kansas Honor 
Flight. She first began designing jew-
elry after developing staphyloma in her 
right eye. Doctors had told her and her 
mother, Mary, that Avery should pick 
up a hobby to help keep her motor 
functions developing properly. Mary 
had made jewelry herself as a child, so 
she showed Avery the tools of the 
trade, and she hasn’t stopped since. 
For a while, Avery had kept up with 
jewelry making for personal use, but 
the death of her grandfather Robert in 
2016 showed her what she could do to 
make a difference with her skills. Rob-
ert was a Korean war veteran who had 
previously gone on an Honor Flight 
himself, which was one of his most 
memorable experiences. After his pass-
ing, Avery started Abundant Love jew-
elry as a tribute to her grandfather and 
a way to support veterans in her com-
munity. With this new business, she 
began selling earrings online and at 
various fundraising events. To date, 
Avery has raised almost $7,000 through 
Abundant Love. 
Stories like Avery’s are what truly 
show the best of Kansas. I have met 
with 
countless 
veterans 
on 
Honor 
Flights, and each has their own unique 
and incredible experience like Robert. 
Avery already is selfless in making and 
selling her earrings to benefit Honor 
Flight, but what truly makes this 
project 
extraordinary 
is 
that 
she 
doesn’t take a penny for herself. Every 
single dollar made from Abundant Love 
goes directly to Honor Flight’s benefit. 
Whether she knows it or not, those vet-
erans appreciate what she does for 
them, and I join them in showing my 
appreciation for Avery. I now ask my 
colleagues to join in me in recognizing 
Avery for her outstanding service for 
our Nation’s heroes.∑

TRIBUTE TO REVEREND ALVIN C. 
HATHAWAY 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to a faith leader and 
community activist from my home 
State of Maryland who has recently 
stepped down from his post as senior 
pastor at Union Baptist Church: Rev-
erend Alvin C. Hathaway. I would like 
to honor his service to the people of 
Maryland and enter the details of his 
journey 
into 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD so that current and future gen-
erations may learn from and study his 
inspiring career. 
The story of Reverend Hathaway’s 
life is deeply bound to the story of 
Union Baptist Church. Alvin Hathaway 
grew up on Druid Hill Avenue in West 
Baltimore in a family that believed 
deeply in combining education and 
service—four doors down from the 
church itself—and he came of age in a 
neighborhood shaped and nurtured by 
faith. That community had cradled 
other great leaders too—leaders who,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8909 
December 2, 2021 
like Reverend Hathaway, bent the arc 
of history toward justice. Thurgood 
Marshall had lived along the same ave-
nue where he grew up. The late great 
Maryland Congressman Elijah Cum-
mings was one of his high school class-
mates. And at an early age, Reverend 
Hathaway was mentored by another 
legendary son of Baltimore City and 
civil 
rights 
champion, 
Reverend 
Vernon Dobson, with whom he helped 
organize 
and 
found 
BUILD, 
Balti-
moreans United in Leadership Develop-
ment. That organization has been serv-
ing the people of Baltimore City for 
over 40 years, helping to improve af-
fordable housing, create jobs, revitalize 
neighborhoods, and so much more. 
Through BUILD, Reverend Hathaway 
left his mark on Baltimore City early 
in his career, and his legacy of good 
works will continue to endure through 
that powerful organization. But he has 
never been one to rest on his laurels, 
and 
Reverend 
Hathaway 
continued 
throughout his life to find new ways of 
serving at the intersection of faith and 
social justice—and of giving back to 
the church and the community that 
raised him. After earning a B.A. from 
the McKendree University School of 
Religion and an M.A. from Saint 
Mary’s Seminary and University in 
Baltimore, Reverend Hathaway pur-
sued a Ph.D. at the United Theological 
Seminary in Ohio, and he chose the 
history of Union Baptist Church as the 
focus of his academic study. Through 
his deep research into the narrative 
and legacy of that church, Reverend 
Hathaway became a steward of the 
church’s culture, traditions, and val-
ues. I submit that no one knows Union 
Baptist Church better than Reverend 
Hathaway. 
He then returned to Baltimore City, 
becoming senior pastor of Union Bap-
tist in 2007, and he channeled his ef-
forts in that role toward renovating 
the very traditions of the church that 
he had studied and lived for so many 
years. Reverend Hathaway marshalled 
the full force of his religious wisdom 
and oratorical gift to guide the West 
Baltimore 
community 
forward, 
through both good times and bad 
times. His swelling sermons moved a 
generation—and grew the faith. 
But 
Reverend 
Hathaway 
learned 
early that the duties of a faith leader 
don’t end at the bricks of the church 
walls. He took the values of his reli-
gious devotion and aimed them at the 
ongoing fight to realize the full prom-
ise of civil rights and equal oppor-
tunity. His efforts have spanned issues 
of health equity, civil rights, wages, 
and 
employment, 
but 
perhaps 
his 
greatest fight of them all has been 
waged through his dedication to ex-
panding access to education. As senior 
pastor, Reverend Hathaway was deeply 
committed to bolstering the church’s 
Head Start Program so more children 
from the surrounding area could re-
ceive high-quality early education. I 
have had the privilege of visiting the 
Union Baptist Head Start with him to 
see, firsthand, the impact his work has 
had 
on 
the 
community. 
Reverend 
Hathaway’s legacy can be seen in the 
wide smiles of the children who benefit 
from that initiative—and who benefit 
from his efforts to grow and strengthen 
that vital program. 
While senior pastor at Union Baptist, 
Reverend Hathaway also served as a 
longtime leader of Promise Heights, an 
organization committed to improving 
outcomes in West Baltimore’s Commu-
nity Schools. He has helped guide the 
course of higher education through his 
role on the board of the University of 
Maryland Medical Center. He was an 
early 
and 
outspoken 
advocate 
for 
bridging the digital divide and nar-
rowing the homework gap so more stu-
dents could access the internet. And 
even now, after his retirement, he is 
leading the fight to transform the now 
vacant lot of P.S. 103 in West Balti-
more into the Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall Center, which will focus on pro-
grams supporting education, justice, 
and ethics. 
He has done all this, and more, over 
the course of an extraordinary career 
marked by a commitment to his faith, 
a dedication to the people of Baltimore 
City, and a belief in the power of com-
munity. Though he has retired as the 
leader of Union Baptist Church, I know 
that he will carry on in the work that 
has defined his tenure as senior pas-
tor—and defined his entire life. I am 
proud to call him a full partner in the 
work of building a more perfect union, 
and I will continue standing shoulder- 
to-shoulder with him in our shared en-
deavor to invest in the success of all.∑

RESOLUTION 
465—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
THE

STATES 
SHOULD

WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND 
EMPHASIZE WITH ALLIES THE 
NEED TO PROVIDE CONTINUED 
SUPPORT 
TO, 
AND 
MAINTAIN

FOR 
THE 
EMIGRATION OUT OF AFGHANI-
STAN OF, INDIVIDUALS WHO DO 
NOT WISH TO BE GOVERNED BY 
THE TALIBAN 
Mr. CASSIDY (for himself and Mrs. 
SHAHEEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 465 
Whereas, on August 15, 2021, the govern-
ment of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan 
collapsed, with President Ashraf Ghani flee-
ing to the United Arab Emirates; 
Whereas, on the same day, the Taliban 
seized Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan; 
Whereas the United States immediately 
began an emergency evacuation of Afghani-
stan, focusing on United States citizens, in-
dividuals with special immigrant visas, and 
refugees with Priority 1 and Priority 2 des-
ignations; 
Whereas, on August 31, 2021, the United 
States ended its evacuation efforts in Af-
ghanistan, leaving United States citizens 
and an unknown—but notably high—number 
of visa-eligible Afghans and other allies at 
risk of harm from the Taliban; 
Whereas Afghan citizens in Afghanistan 
are increasingly at risk of food insecurity 
and poverty; 
Whereas the increase of poverty in Afghan-
istan creates conditions that could lead to a 
dramatic increase in human trafficking and 
child, early, or force marriage, which dis-
proportionately impact women and girls; 
Whereas the United States has a legal duty 
to protect United States citizens and lawful 
permanent residents from harm; 
Whereas the United States has a moral 
duty and security interest in protecting the 
Afghan citizens who worked to build a de-
mocracy for themselves based on assurances 
from the United States Government that 
such efforts would be defended by the United 
States and its allies; 
Whereas the United States has a humani-
tarian responsibility to protect individuals 
who— 
(1) are at risk of retribution based on 
their— 
(A) religious beliefs; 
(B) activities supporting democracy in Af-
ghanistan; or 
(C) defense of human rights, especially 
women’s rights and empowerment; 
(2) are in imminent danger due to the ab-
sence of the United States-led coalition in 
Afghanistan, which spanned two decades; or 
(3) are at risk of hunger or starvation; 
Whereas the United States has ended its 
military presence in Afghanistan and will 
conduct any remaining operations in Af-
ghanistan from Doha, Qatar; and 
Whereas the United States should not ac-
cept the loss of two decades of nation-build-
ing, civil society strengthening, elections 
monitoring, advances in rights for girls and 
women, cultural exchange programs, and 
many other initiatives in collaboration with 
the people of Afghanistan: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) it is the sense of the Senate that— 
(A) the Secretary of State, in consultation 
with relevant Federal agencies, should lead a 
coordinated effort— 
(i) to extract United States citizens and 
lawful permanent residents from Afghani-
stan; 
(ii) to support Afghan citizens in their ef-
forts to safely leave Afghanistan; and 
(iii) to maintain open lines of contact and 
help with individuals remaining in Afghani-
stan under the Taliban; 
(B) to carry out the coordinated effort de-
scribed in subparagraph (A), the Secretary of 
State should— 
(i) advise and consult with appropriate par-
ties to advocate for the rights and freedoms 
of the people of Afghanistan at all inter-
national venues and with the governments of 
partner countries; and 
(ii) oversee support such as— 
(I) assistance mechanisms for Afghan citi-
zens who are in need of humanitarian assist-
ance or who are defending the human rights 
and freedoms of Afghan citizens; and 
(II) other mechanisms sufficient to con-
tinue to advocate for United States interests 
with United States allies and among the 
international community; 
(iii) continue the coordinated effort de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) until the later 
of— 
(I) the date on which the Secretary of 
State has assisted in physically relocating, 
from Afghanistan to locations outside of the 
internationally recognized border of Afghan-
istan, any— 
(aa) citizen of the United States; and 
(bb) lawful permanent resident of the 
United States; 
(II) the date on which an independent 
human rights monitor has been established 
and is functioning in Afghanistan; and 
(III) the date on which the Secretary of 
State identifies a neutral international orga-
nization or entity that is able to vie for 
United States interests in Afghanistan till 
such a time as Afghanistan is returned to le-
gitimate government; 
(C) the United States should— 
(i) work with the United Nations to estab-
lish humanitarian corridors from and to 
countries bordering Afghanistan, including 
Tajikistan, which has indicated willingness 
to receive Afghan refugees; and 
(ii) work with such countries to ensure the 
efficient and safe reception and processing of 
Afghan refugees, in accordance with inter-
national humanitarian law, to be registered 
by the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees and processed swiftly and equi-
tably for travel to recipient countries, in-
cluding the United States; 
(D) such humanitarian corridors should be 
free from obstruction by the Taliban, and 
safe passage should be provided by the 
United Nations or any other organization; 
(E) humanitarian assistance should con-
tinue to be provided to Afghanistan through 
the United Nations and international non-
governmental organizations, with special 
focus on the most vulnerable individuals, in-
cluding women, girls, and individuals from 
ethnic minority groups, while also ensuring 
that the assistance does not benefit the 
Taliban politically or otherwise; 
(F) the United Nations should appoint an 
independent, nongovernmental human rights 
monitor, who— 
(i) should have continued free access 
throughout 
Afghanistan 
to 
ensure 
the 
Taliban is not brutalizing individuals and 
families living in Afghanistan; and 
(ii) should report to the United Nations Se-
curity Council in an ongoing fashion on the 
human rights and humanitarian situation on 
the ground in Afghanistan; 
(G) the United States should convene a 
high-level summit to identify and consult 
with countries willing and able to receive Af-
ghan refugees; and 
(H) the Secretary of State should ensure 
robust interagency coordination and improve 
collaboration and transparency with Con-
gress, United States civil society, and reset-
tlement agencies so as to improve proc-
essing, service provision, and United States 
capacity to welcome; and 
(2) the Senate discourages the United 
States Government from engaging with the 
Taliban in any way that would grant the 
Taliban benefits typically afforded to legiti-
mate governments or would otherwise legiti-
mize the Taliban, including by— 
(A) making deposits through the World 
Bank Group, the International Monetary 
Fund, or the Department of the Treasury or 
facilitating any other transactions that 
would provide economic support to the 
Taliban; 
(B) providing any foreign assistance for a 
nonhumanitarian purpose that might benefit 
or accrue to the Taliban; 
(C) facilitating any exchange of Ambas-
sadors or fielding any diplomatic mission 
that goes beyond an ‘‘interest section’’ nec-
essary for diplomatic conversations without 
recognition; or 
(D) allowing the Taliban to occupy Af-
ghanistan’s seat in the United Nations.

PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE

ERGY AGENCY’S (IAEA) NUCLEAR 
SECURITY ROLE 
Mr. LUJA´ N (for himself, Mr. LEAHY, 
Mr. MARKEY, and Mr. MERKLEY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 466 
Whereas the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), created in 1957 for the pur-
pose of assisting states in the development 
and use of nuclear technology for peaceful 
purposes, plays a critical role in the global 
nuclear security regime; 
Whereas the agency’s activities in nuclear 
security date back to the 1970s, when the 
agency began providing ad hoc training 
courses in physical protection; 
Whereas these responsibilities expanded 
following the collapse of the former Soviet 
Union, reports of nuclear smuggling in the 
late 1990s, and again after the devastating 
terror attacks on September 11, 2001; 
Whereas the agency established the Nu-
clear Security Fund to assist countries in 
protecting their nuclear and radiological 
materials and facilities; 
Whereas the agency’s nuclear security ef-
forts are sustained by its technical expertise,

and

tiality; 
Whereas rogue regimes and clandestine or-
ganizations continue to exhibit the ambition 
to acquire nuclear materials that can be 
used to build crude radiological and nuclear 
weapons; 
Whereas the IAEA Office of Nuclear Secu-
rity relies almost exclusively on voluntary 
funding, which is inherently unpredictable 
and inconsistent; and 
Whereas the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit 
in Washington, D.C., issued an Action Plan 
on April 1, 2016, citing the agency’s need for 
‘‘reliable and sufficient resources’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) maintains that the International Atom-
ic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays an indispen-
sable role in strengthening nuclear security 
and safety around the globe; 
(2) reaffirms that the United States has a 
vital interest in preventing the spread of nu-
clear weapons and securing nuclear mate-
rials; and 
(3) encourages the United States and other 
member states of the IAEA to take steps to 
ensure that the IAEA has the resources need-
ed to successfully carry out its duties, in-
cluding— 
(A) supporting the IAEA to continue con-
vening ministerial meetings on nuclear secu-
rity to promote political commitment; 
(B) contributing to the implementation of 
the IAEA’s Nuclear Security Plan through 
reliable and sufficient resources; 
(C) providing appropriate political, tech-

Security Fund; and 
(D) developing a comprehensive strategy to

SENATE RESOLUTION 467—RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
MADE BY THE 305-METER RADIO 
TELESCOPE 
AT 
THE 
ARECIBO 
OBSERVATORY 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. 
RUBIO, Ms. WARREN, Mr. MARKEY, and 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation: 
S. RES. 467 
Whereas the Department of Defense began 
developing the Arecibo Observatory located 
in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, 
during the 1950s, and its characteristic in-
strument, a large radio telescope of 305 me-
ters in diameter was completed in 1963; 
Whereas the facility was later owned by 
the National Science Foundation, and sup-
ported by the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration and various university 
partners; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory’s 305- 
meter fixed spherical radio telescope, was 
the world’s largest single-dish radio tele-
scope until the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture 
Spherical Radio Telescope located in Gizhou, 
China, began observing in 2016; 
Whereas the 305-meter radio telescope 
made unparalleled contributions to the fields 
of radio astronomy, planetary, and atmos-
pheric sciences, and played a role in inspir-
ing thousands of students in Puerto Rico, the 
Nation, and the world to pursue careers in 
STEM fields through the Arecibo Observ-
atory Education and Public Outreach Pro-
grams; 
Whereas the radio telescope significantly 
advanced the field of radio astronomy, in-
cluding the first indirect detection of gravi-
tational 
waves, 
the 
first 
detection 
of 
extrasolar planets, innumerable contribu-
tions to the field of time domain astronomy 
and the study of the interstellar medium, 
and played a key role in the search for extra-
terrestrial intelligence; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory had the 
best planetary radar system in the world, 
used by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration for near-Earth object detec-
tion and was an essential part of the agen-
cy’s planetary defense program; 
Whereas the planetary radar at the Are-
cibo Observatory has contributed fundamen-
tally and significantly to the knowledge of 
the solar system; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory’s Inco-
herent Scatter Radar and supporting facili-
ties 
have 
provided 
fundamental 
under-
standing of the ionosphere and upper atmos-
phere, and the interface between the atmos-
phere and space that protects the planet 
from solar wind, meteors, and other poten-
tial threats; and 
Whereas, December 1, 2021, marks the 1- 
year anniversary of the uncontrolled col-
lapse sustained by the radio telescope after a 
series of cable failures in tower 4: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) acknowledges the loss of the Arecibo 
Observatory’s radio telescope due to its col-
lapse and its implications for the loss of a 
unique world-class multidisciplinary science 
facility which conducted research in the 
areas of space and atmospheric sciences, 
radar astronomy and planetary sciences, as-
tronomy, and astrophysics; 
(2) acknowledges that the uncontrolled col-
lapse of the 305-meter radio telescope rep-
resents a remarkable loss of astronomical 
observation capabilities, scientific research 
and development, planetary defense capabili-
ties, and applied science advantage for the 
United States; 
(3) recognizes the rich scientific, edu-
cational, and economic benefits that the 
Arecibo Telescope has made to the people of 
Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world;

HONORING THE ANDREWS BAND 
DIRECTOR AND BUS DRIVER 
HON. AUGUST PFLUGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer sympathy and prayer to the 
community of Andrews, as well as the families 
of Darin Johns and Marc Boswell, who were 
tragically killed in a bus crash while traveling 
with the Andrews High School Band to a Mus-
tangs playoff game two weeks ago. 
Darin Johns was the beloved band director 
for Andrews High School. In the weeks since 
the accident, we have seen an outpouring of 
testimonies about Mr. Johns from former stu-
dents, friends, colleagues, and other band di-
rectors across the entire state of Texas. 
As I learn more about the life that Mr. Johns 
led, I am continually encouraged by the quality 
of service that he gave to his community and 
the quantity of people whose lives he touched. 
Mr. Johns was an active member of the An-
drews community who dedicated his life to his 
faith, loved his wife Karen and family and 
friends deeply, and invested in his natural tal-
ent and deep love of music. He was a gifted 
musician who could play almost any instru-
ment he touched. In his free time, he played 
in a Christian band and directed the church 
praise band as an active member of the Cal-
vary Baptist Church. 
Mr. Johns deepest passion was encour-
aging the younger generations. For over 30 
years, he taught others to love music as a 
high school band director. Over his impressive 
tenure, Mr. Johns led three different high 
school marching bands to the State Marching 
Contest. He lent all his time and energy to 
building up the dreams and talents of those 
around him. 
I also want to recognize Marc Boswell, a 
humble and beloved Andrews public servant, 
who also tragically passed away in the bus 
crash. 
Marc devoted his life to Andrews—as a high 
school math teacher, employee of the An-
drews school district, involved community 
leader, and beloved friend, father, husband, 
and son. After retiring, Mr. Boswell stayed 
busy running stats for the Andrews football 
team, timing the swim team meets, and driving 
buses for Andrews ISD sports and extra-cur-
ricular activities. 
He was known for his servant heart, incred-
ible work ethic, infectious smiles, and deep 
love for his wife Carol and his children and 
grandchildren. 
Andrews ISD and our communities across 
West Texas are mourning the loss of these 
two incredible men. 
Camille and I are sending our support and 
prayers to Andrews, to the families of Mr. 
Johns and Mr. Boswell, as well as the loved 
ones of Nathan Haile, who was also killed in 
the crash. 
MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE 
AWARENESS 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
bring awareness to the current mental health 
crisis. 
My home state of Arkansas has one of the 
highest proportions of individuals with trauma 
and PTSD in the nation. The COVID crisis has 
increased the mental health needs of Arkan-
sans and all Americans. 
Last year in Arkansas we tragically lost 583 
of our neighbors, friends, and family members 
to suicide. Many personally know the pain of 
what it is like to lose a person to suicide. 
Suicide rates in Arkansas are above the 
American average. Simultaneously, Arkansas 
also has a higher rate of adults with mental 
health conditions, including anxiety and de-
pression. 
There are more resources now than ever to 
provide support for anyone who needs it. I am 
proud to have supported funding for these re-
sources earlier this Congress, including fund-
ing for the National Suicide Prevention Life-
line. 
Mental health can be a tough topic to speak 
about, but it shouldn’t be.

HONORING LEROY WARE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant, Mr. Leroy Ware. 
Leroy Ware is the youngest of eleven chil-
dren, born April 14, 1954 to Mr. Granville and 
Mrs. Myrtle Ware in the Browning Community. 
Leroy attended and graduated from Amanda 
Elzy High School. He was an honor student 
while still participating in the football program 
at school and helping the family cultivate and 
harvest crops. 
After graduating from high school, Leroy at-
tended Mississippi Valley State University in 
Itta Bena, Mississippi, and studied Business 
Administration. He participated in the Co-Op 
Program at Mississippi Valley State University 
and was assigned to Warner Robins Air Force 
Base in Warner Robins, Georgia. There, he 
trained to be a systems analyst. Leroy was 
later employed by the first African American 
Tax Assessor/Collector of Leflore County. 
Leroy worked as a deputy assessor from 
1985 until 1999. He then, successfully vied for 
and won the elected title of Tax Assessor in 
1999. He still competently holds that position. 
Leroy is married to Mrs. Earlean Davidson 
Ware. They have three children, Stephanie 
Davidson, Stephen Davidson, and Krystal 
Austin. Leroy has lived by the lessons taught 
to him by his father: ‘‘Family is everything; 
You don’t fight family; and, Always be there to 
lend a helping hand.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Leroy Ware for his dedi-
cation and tenacity to serving his community 
and desire to be an example for all.

HONORING 
ST. 
JOSEPH 
COUNTY 
COMMISSIONER 
ANDY 
KOSTIELNEY FOR HIS SERVICE 
TO HOOSIERS 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor St. Joseph County Commis-
sioner Andy Kostielney for his outstanding 
service to Hoosiers in our community and be-
yond as he prepares to retire in 2022. For 
more than a decade, Commissioner Kostielney 
has been a dedicated, savvy, and servant- 
hearted leader. 
As the District 1 Commissioner, he rep-
resents northern St. Joseph County, including 
Granger, all of Clay, German and Harris town-
ships and parts of the far-north sides of South 
Bend and Mishawaka. 
Throughout 
his 
tenure, 
Commissioner 
Kostielney—who currently serves as President 
of the Board of Commissioners—has worked 
tirelessly to deliver results for St. Joseph 
County Hoosiers. Since taking office in 2009, 
he has developed expertise on the issues that 
matter most to our community—creating jobs, 
stewarding resources, and building a brighter 
future for St. Joseph County. 
Among his many achievements, Commis-
sioner Kostielney spearheaded the South 
Shore double tracking project that will make it 
easier for those who work in the Chicago area 
to join our community and make a home in In-
diana. He also has developed key public-pri-
vate partnerships, including with the University 
of Notre Dame, to drive results for Hoosier 
families. 
A lifelong Hoosier, Commissioner Kostielney 
has deep roots in this region. This is where he 
and his wife, Joy, have raised their beautiful 
family and served as active community mem-
bers. In addition to his official duties in St. Jo-
seph County, Commissioner Kostielney also 
serves as Assistant Manager of the Robinson 
Community Learning Center at the University 
of Notre Dame. 
Previously, he served on the St. Joseph 
County Council from 2003 through 2006. As 
he 
prepares 
to 
retire, 
Commissioner 
Kostielney leaves an outstanding legacy that 
has contributed to the overall development, 
growth and modernization of St. Joseph Coun-
ty. 
On behalf of the 2nd District of Indiana, it is 
my privilege to honor Commissioner Andy 
Kostielney and thank him for his years of serv-
ice to our community. I am proud to call Com-
missioner Kostielney a dear friend, and I am

HONORING 
ANTHONY 
GALAGAZA 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE BA-
KERSFIELD FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Bakersfield Fire Depart-
ment Chief Anthony Galagaza on his retire-
ment from the Bakersfield Fire Department 
after 30 years of public service to our commu-
nity. 
Anthony’s career as a first responder and 
exposure to firefighting began when he ac-
cepted a summer position in 1989 as a sea-
sonal firefighter for the United States Bureau 
of Land Management. Captivated by the field, 
Anthony decided to take his talents to the Ba-
kersfield Fire Department, where he would 
complete over 30 years of service. Indicative 
of his knowledge of public safety and passion 
for helping others in times of crisis, Anthony 
quickly climbed the ladder within the Depart-
ment. In 1990, Anthony started out as a re-
serve firefighter and in 1992 became a full- 
time firefighter. In 2013, Anthony was pro-
moted to Fire Battalion Chief after serving as 
a fire engineer and Fire Captain. Five years 
later, Anthony was tapped to become the Fire 
Chief, overseeing the Department’s fleet of 
personnel, fire stations, and various divisions. 
During his tenure as Fire Chief, Anthony 
has transformed the Department to ensure it 
had the staff and resources necessary to tack-
le the challenges of the next decade. Some of 
his major achievements include significantly 
increasing the number of rescue squads and 
arson personnel in the Department, advancing 
health and wellness programs for Department 
staff and firefighters, and fostering public trust 
in the community. The emphasis on public 
trust and outreach helped the Bakersfield Fire 
Department maintain its elite status among fire 
departments as a recipient of a class two rat-
ing by the Insurance Services Office, which 
assesses the ability of a fire department to re-
spond effectively to fires in its area of respon-
sibility. This high rating indicates the effective-
ness of the Bakersfield Fire Department and is 
a testament to Anthony’s effective leadership 
as the Fire Chief. 
Anthony’s investment in, and passion for, 
keeping the people of Bakersfield safe is with-
out question. That is why, in August 2021, as 
House Republican Leader, I had the privilege 
to appoint him to the Medal of Valor Review 
Board, which reviews individuals to be award-
ed the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor— 
the highest national award for valor a public 
safety officer can receive—and make rec-
ommendations to the White House. 
Throughout his career, Anthony has dedi-
cated himself to serving others, building trust 
in the city, and ensuring the safety and secu-
rity of homes, schools, and workplaces in our 
community. He has been integral in high-
lighting the value of our firefighting and dis-
patch personnel and will be missed by the Ba-
kersfield Fire Department, which he has re-
ferred to as his second family. On behalf of 
the people of Bakersfield and the 23rd Con-
gressional District of California, I would like to 
thank Anthony for his decades of service to 
our community and I wish him and his family 
the very best as he starts this next chapter of 
his life.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN KAZAKHSTAN 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
the global competition for ideas between the 
community of democracies and the People’s 
Republic of China (PRC) is nowhere more ap-
parent than in Kazakhstan, where the PRC 
has steadily increased its influence in the 
country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The PRC wants Kazakh oil, cheap Kazakh 
labor, and most importantly, Kazakh govern-
ment help silencing predominantly-Muslim 
Central Asian peoples, whose reports of geno-
cide on their kinsmen in Xinjiang are incon-
venient and embarrassing to the PRC. 
While pursuing their goals in Kazakhstan, 
the PRC pushes its authoritarian governance 
model, a growing contempt for human rights, 
and assistance with mass surveillance tools. 
And too many Kazakh leaders have proven to 
be all-too-willing accomplices. 
Perhaps most troubling is the PRC’s pres-
sure 
on 
Kazakhstan 
to 
keep 
Kazakhs, 
Uyghurs, Kyrgyz and other Central Asians si-
lent about the genocide and other gross viola-
tions of human rights in Xinjiang. On July 13, 
2021, Gulzira Auelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh 
from 
the 
PRC 
who 
had 
emigrated 
to 
Kazakhstan but returned to China, gave heart-
breaking testimony at the hearing I chaired at 
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission 
about her experience as a survivor of China’s 
concentration camps. 
Ms. Auelkhan testified that while she was in 
the camp, Chinese authorities subjected her to 
physical, mental, and spiritual torture. One 
particularly disturbing story was that Chinese 
authorities inserted needles under her finger-
nails for attempting to cheat on a Chinese lan-
guage exam. She also testified that the Chi-
nese Communist Party (CCP) runs a forced 
prostitution system inside these camps, where 
Chinese men routinely rape the female pris-
oners. 
While Chinese authorities released her due 
to pressure from a Radio Free Asia story that 
revealed her plight, Gulzira’s troubles only in-
creased upon her return to Kazakhstan. In-
stead of sympathy, Kazakh officials intimidated 
her, and pressured her family to stop speaking 
out about the horrors she experienced in 
Xinjiang. Her refusal to stay silent resulted in 
her having to flee to the United States in 
search of a place where she could speak free-
ly about the Chinese concentration camps, 
and how Kazakhstan rejected her. 
The fact that Kazakhstan enables China’s 
genocide in Xinjiang arises from Kazakhstan’s 
dependence upon PRC’s massive monetary 
investments, including in the Belt and Road 
Initiative, and the malfeasance of kleptocratic 
Kazakh officials. 
Some of these corrupt officials reportedly 
have ties with the Eurasian Natural Resources 
Corporation (ENRC), a Kazakh-based com-
pany that three billionaire Kazakh business-
men and the Kazakh government founded. 
ENRC shares ties with members of the former 
president’s 
family, 
particularly 
Timur 
Kulibayev, who was part of a questionable 
pipeline deal brokered with Chinese entities. 
The company has also been investigated by 
the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO). 
Sadly the record of gross human rights vio-
lations by government officials acting with im-
punity is not new in Kazakhstan. In 2012, at 
a hearing I chaired, entitled: ‘‘Kazakhstan: As 
Stable As It’s Government Claims?’’, our wit-
nesses provided expert testimony questioning 
the stability of the country and exposing state-
wide corruption and massive human rights 
abuses sanctioned by the Kazakhstan govern-
ment—including torture and abuse by govern-
ment security forces. 
At the time, the government of Kazakhstan 
was headed by the former authoritarian 
‘‘President for Life’’ Nazarbayev, who ruled 
with an iron fist, snuffing out dissent and fight-
ing hard to obscure the serious human rights 
and democracy deficiencies that marked his 
reign. 
Today, unfortunately, his oldest daughter, 
Dariga Nazarbayeva reportedly carries on the 
family legacy of corruption as a member of the 
Kazakh Congress. 
According to the Eurasia Democracy Initia-
tive, Dariga Nazarbayeva used an illegal pass-
port to open multiple Austrian bank accounts 
containing millions of dollars, tapping her posi-
tion and her father’s to launder ill-gotten 
wealth out of the country. A Times of London 
article recently revealed that she and her son 
owned over £140 million of property, including 
the fictional home of Sherlock Holmes, located 
on 221b Baker Street. 
There is little hope that these oligarchs, rich 
with money stolen from their own people with 
the assistance the genocidal foreign regime of 
the PRC, will even-handedly administer justice 
or respect human rights when they so readily 
abuse the rule of law, jeopardizing the rights 
and security of their fellow Kazakh citizens at 
the apparent behest of the CCP and for their 
own financial interests. 
The Biden Administration must engage the 
government of Kazakhstan more forcefully, in-
cluding the use of sanctions under the Global 
Magnitsky Act. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in pressing the Biden Administration to 
elevate and combat the human rights abuses 
in Kazakhstan, address corruption in this stra-
tegic part of the world, and do everything it 
can to counter the CCP’s baneful influence in 
Kazakhstan.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RANDAL 
S. MACDONALD 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the life of Randal 
(Randy) S. MacDonald, who died unexpect-
edly on October 6, 2021. Randy is deserving 
of recognition for his life-long commitment to 
protecting our environment, and his pas-
sionate efforts to educate and inspire action to 
address the existential crisis of climate 
change.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1301 
December 2, 2021 
Randy was born in Alameda, California and 
was raised in a family that valued the impor-
tance of environmental activism. From a 
young age, he was passionate about politics, 
the environment, and social justice. Randy 
went on to graduate Summa Cum Laude from 
University of Oregon, in 1990, with a degree 
in Political Science. 
While in Oregon, Randy was an elected City 
Councilor in Eugene, Oregon, and worked as 
Director of Legislative and Community Affairs 
at University of Oregon. He is remembered 
there for his leadership in successful efforts to 
restore state funding for public higher edu-
cation, and for winning voter approval of fund-
ing to build and improve local fire department 
facilities. 
Randy returned home to California in 2000, 
settling in scenic Comptche, California, in the 
heart of Mendocino County. Always a steward 
of the environment, Randy planted 2,800 red-
woods on his 50 acres to aid its return to the 
natural conifer forest it once was. He served 
on many committees and boards of groups 
fighting for action on climate change, including 
as Chair of the Redwood Chapter of the Sierra 
Club’s Climate and Energy Committee. In his 
professional work, he served as partner/owner 
and COO of a successful online business of-
fering continuing education for health care pro-
fessionals. 
Randy’s community service was both deep 
and broad. Randy advocated in Washington, 
D.C. for all rural communities to have high 
speed internet connectivity, and he succeeded 
in bringing this to Comptche in 2009. He was 
an active volunteer with the Comptche Volun-
teer Fire Department for twenty years, still 
holding the position of Safety Officer at the 
time of his death. 
Randy is survived by his wife Janis, stepson 
Jonathan, father James and his wife Carol, 
siblings Charlotte, Gail, and Mark, stepbrother 
Rande, and stepfather Ed, five nieces, and 
one nephew. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join me in extending condolences to Randy’s 
family and many friends, and in expressing 
our deep appreciation for Randy’s extraor-
dinary dedication throughout his life to the bet-
terment of our natural environment and the 
broader community.

HONORING ADEOLA ‘‘ABRAHAM’’ 
OLAGBEGI 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Adeola ‘‘Abraham’’ Olagbegi 
from Jackson, Mississippi. 
After a successful bone marrow transplant 
in November 2020, Adeola Olagbegi was 
given a chance to Make-A-Wish. Instead of 
wanting something a typical 13-year-old fight-
ing cancer may ask for, he used his wish to 
start something bigger than himself 
Mr. Olagbegi chose to use his wish to feed 
the homeless for a year in his hometown, 
Jackson, MS. Before being diagnosed with 
Aplastic Anemia, a rare and life-threatening 
blood disorder, Mr. Olagbegi and his family 
looked forward to feeding the homeless every 
third Saturday in every month. This service to 
the community is known as ‘‘Abraham’s 
Table.’’ ‘‘It was always a good thing to do, and 
that’s what I grew up doing that, so I go back 
to my roots to do what I was taught to do.’’ 
‘‘I am a person of hope, so when you come 
against a big mountain, you have to remember 
you have a big God.’’ Mr. Olagbegi is a living 
testimony that if you pour out good unto God’s 
people, God will turn around and bless you 
beyond measure. 
After 10 months of ‘‘Abraham’s Table’’, Mr. 
Olagbegi hopes to turn his wish into a non-
profit organization that will continue to impact 
the City of Jackson for the better. Since the 
beginning of Abraham’s Table, Mr. Olagbegi 
has fed over hundreds of homeless citizens. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Adeola ‘‘Abraham’’ 
Olagbegi for his dedication to serve the home-
less for years to come.

COMMENDING THE LEADERSHIP 
OF DAN FINCH 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commending the leadership of Dan 
Finch, Texas Medical Association Vice Presi-
dent of Advocacy, upon his retirement after 39 
years of exemplary work on behalf of patient 
care and the physician practice of medicine. 
Daniel ‘‘Dan’’ Thomas Finch was born on 
November 16, 1952, reared on the outskirts of 
Washington, D.C., the eldest of seven chil-
dren, and the son of a Navy veteran. He 
moved to Texas in 1982, to work for the Harris 
County Medical Society before heading to 
Austin in 2006 to join the public affairs advo-
cacy team of the Texas Medical Association. 
Dan’s commitment to hard work and serving 
others began early in life in Catholic school as 
an altar boy and later with his first job out of 
University of North Carolina as a bus driver. 
These early life experiences molded Dan’s 
leadership, communication, and navigation 
skills which serendipitously led him into a 
medical association communications position 
with the North Carolina Medical Society, and 
then a brief stint with the American Medical 
Association in Chicago, before heading to 
Houston where he began a 24-year stint with 
the Harris County Medical Society, and even-
tually to Austin where he has served the past 
15 years with the Texas Medical Association. 
Dan’s rapid trajectory and success profes-
sionally in the field of medical association 
communications and advocacy was matched 
only by his private life as a Renaissance man 
who developed keen interests as a guitarist, 
singer, photographer, golfer, motorcycle enthu-
siast, world traveler, cigar afficionado, Astros 
baseball fan, home gardener, and outdoor grill 
master. 
Dan has been equally well grounded as a 
dedicated husband to his loving wife, Becky, 
for the past 41 years, as a caring father to 
their daughter, Liz, and son, Nate, and as the 
loving ‘‘Pops’’ to all of his grandchildren. He 
has offered his many talents to the commu-
nity, including being a member of his church 
band in Houston which performed every Sun-
day in their Hawaiian shirts. His respect 
among his working peers, his dedicated serv-
ice to the more than 53,000 member physi-
cians in the Texas Medical Association, and 
his public affairs accomplishments in both the 
Texas Legislature and in Congress led to his 
ascension as Vice President of Advocacy for 
the Texas Medical Association. 
Texas is a better and healthier State in part 
to Dan’s steadfast commitment to the highest 
standards and quality of patient care in Texas, 
protections for physician autonomy in caring 
for their patients, common sense health insur-
ance reforms which put patients before insur-
ance profits, and medical liability protections 
which prevent lawsuit abuse. 
Dan’s most memorable advice to his young-
er colleagues was, ‘‘A doctor long ago told me 
if we do what’s right for patients, we’ll do 
what’s right for physicians, and that’s always 
been my guiding light.’’ 
Dan and Becky are now replacing the rolling 
Texas Hill Country of Austin with a retirement 
home closer to their grandkids in the rolling 
hills of Manhattan, Kansas (which is much 
preferable to that other Manhattan). 
I ask that my fellow Members join me in sa-
luting the life, work, and accomplishments of 
Daniel ‘‘Dan’’ Thomas Finch, on behalf of the 
Texas Medical Association, for a healthier Na-
tion. I am humbled to formally declare Dan a 
‘‘great American’’ who has earned his retire-
ment spurs and a ‘‘great Texan’’ (even if he’s 
not in Texas anymore).

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CHERYL CATES 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Key West’s 
former First Lady, Cheryl Cates. Her out-
standing public service to the Florida Keys 
and South Florida and unwavering sense of 
conviction earned her the respect and admira-
tion from those who knew her and anyone she 
crossed paths with. 
Cheryl led an incredible life full of persever-
ance and devotion. She was selfless and dedi-
cated to our community having served on sev-
eral boards and committees. In 2012, Cheryl 
was awarded the Community Service Award 
of Excellence for her committed decade of 
service to Zonta, an organization dedicated to 
empowering women through service and ad-
vocacy. Additionally, she was awarded the 
Key West Business Guild’s Presidential Award 
and the Key West Star Award from the Cham-
ber of Commerce for her grand contributions 
over the years. 
Cheryl’s tremendous service over the years 
was exemplary. Her legacy is a testament of 
what it means to be selfless and noble. Her 
ongoing support and encouragement for local 
non-profits fostered great awareness in the 
Keys. Cheryl served as the First Lady of Key 
West for more than a decade, representing 
city leadership at hundreds of events through-
out former Mayor Craig Cates’ time in office. 
A woman of dignity and integrity, Cheryl 
Cates will be remembered for her lifelong 
charitable contributions to Key West and her 
dedication to public service. It was a pleasure 
knowing her. She will be profoundly missed.

HONORING MICHAEL R. MELILLO 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
and pay tribute to Michael Melillo, of Niles, 
who passed away on Wednesday, November 
24, 2021 at the Cleveland Clinic. He was 64 
years old. 
He was born April 6, 1957, in Warren, the 
son of Ray and Jean Walden Melillo. Mike 
was a 1975 graduate of Niles McKinley High 
School and owned and operated Men’s Union 
Barbershop as well as the adjoining beauty 
shop, Hair Design by Michael. Mike deeply 
loved the city of Niles, and he was a beloved 
fixture of the community. For the last almost 
40 years, he could be found daily at his Rob-
bins Avenue barbershop—an establishment 
built by Mike’s immigrant grandfather, Phillip 
Melillo in the 1930s. 
He was a lifelong member of Our Lady of 
Mount Carmel Catholic Parish in Niles and 
was a proud Italian-American. His world re-
volved around his family and nothing pleased 
him more than to be surrounded by his ador-
ing grandkids. 
Mike led a very active and healthy lifestyle. 
Beyond daily fitness, Mike enjoyed golfing, 
swimming, running and playing bocce. He 
loved basketball and was known for his sharp 
jumpshot all the way up until he quit playing 
in his late 50s. Many of Mike’s days were 
spent coaching his children’s youth sports 
teams and eventually attending his grand-
children’s games. Mike restarted the Mount 
Carmel grade-school basketball program with 
Stu Sussman in 1999, where his teams were 
exceptionally 
successful 
in 
both 
winning 
games and building life-long loving friendships. 
Family traditions were important to Mike. In 
the summer, he could be found tending his 
garden and, in the fall, crushing grapes in the 
wine cellar. Mike was also a Niles Frontliner 
who had a reverence for the proud Red Drag-
on Football program. 
Mike meant the world to his loved ones and 
served as the guiding star for his wife and 
children. He will be gravely missed by his fa-
ther of Niles; his wife, Gerri Gatta Melillo; a 
son, Vincent Melillo and his wife, Christina of 
Dublin, Ohio; two daughters, Michelle Spano 
and her husband, Randy of Canfield and Rose 
Allison Johnson and her husband, Chaz of 
Niles; a brother, Raymond T. Melillo and his 
wife, Pam of Poland; three sisters, Vickie 
Janik and her husband, Ed of Niles, Monica 
Melillo and her fiance, Bill Hensley of Paines-
ville and Gwen Maynard of Youngstown; 
seven grandchildren, Chaz, Enzo, Nico, Mia, 
Carmela, Capri and Michael; and a little girl 
due in June (Vince and Christi). He was pre-
ceded in death by his mother. 
A friend to so many, Mike had a one-of-a- 
kind sense of humor. He had a knack for 
building profound relationships and leaving a 
positive impact on people’s lives. While his 
presence will be most painfully missed by both 
his family and community, his influence will be 
everlasting.

HONORING KNOXVILLE CHIEF OF 
POLICE EVE THOMAS’ RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas, 
who recently announced her retirement after 
nearly 30 years in law enforcement. 
Chief Thomas joined the Knoxville Police 
Department in 1993. She served in many ca-
pacities, including as a Patrol Officer, Problem 
Solving Instructor, Field Training Officer, and a 
Domestic Violence/Terrorism Instructor at Wal-
ters State Community College. 
In 1998, she was promoted to Sergeant and 
served as an Accreditation Manager, Patrol 
Sergeant, and Personnel Sergeant. 
Chief Thomas was promoted again in 2005 
to the rank of Lieutenant. With this promotion, 
she assumed administrative responsibilities of 
KPD’s specialty units, including the Crisis Ne-
gotiation Unit, Special Operations Squad, K9 
Unit, and several others. She was critical to all 
these units’ operations and, as a result of her 
reliable performance, Chief Thomas was given 
additional responsibilities as Patrol Lieutenant, 
Central Business District Supervisor, and Traf-
fic Services Supervisor. 
In 2011, Chief Thomas achieved the rank of 
Captain and gained supervision of KPD’s Sup-
port Services Division. 
In 2013, she was assigned to the Patrol Di-
vision as East District Commander, and then 
served as Commander of the Department’s In-
ternal Affairs Unit and the Criminal Investiga-
tions Division. 
In February 2018, Chief Thomas was pro-
moted to Deputy Chief over the Criminal In-
vestigation Division. Four months later, she 
became the 26th Chief of Police and the first 
woman to hold the top position at the Knox-
ville Police Department. She has served in this 
position ever since. 
Chief Thomas dedicated her career to pro-
tecting the people of Knoxville. I thank Chief 
Thomas for her service. I wish her the very 
best in her retirement. 
ARKANSAS CODING ACADEMY 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Arkansas Coding Academy 
on their 5-year anniversary. 
Since its foundation in 2016, the Arkansas 
Coding Academy has provided roughly 300 
students with the tools and resources needed 
to succeed in the rapidly growing tech industry 
and programing opportunities across central 
Arkansas. 
Individual courses typically last only four 
weeks, and the curriculum as a whole is typi-
cally completed in six to nine months. 
Their annual Demo Day provided students 
with the opportunity to show off their final 
projects while also having the opportunity to 
be recruited by hiring managers. 
The Arkansas Coding Academy develops 
skilled workers, and I am proud to have such 
an outstanding program in central Arkansas.

HONORING MARC BOSWELL 
HON. AUGUST PFLUGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. PLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to offer sympathy and prayer to the community 
of Andrews, as well as the family of Marc Bos-
well, who was tragically killed in a bus crash 
while traveling with the Andrews High School 
Band to a Mustangs playoff game two weeks 
ago. 
Marc Boswell was a humble and beloved 
Andrews public servant, who tragically passed 
away in the bus crash. 
Marc devoted his life to Andrews—as a high 
school math teacher, employee of the An-
drews school district, involved community 
leader, and beloved friend, father, husband, 
and son. After retiring, Mr. Boswell stayed 
busy running stats for the Andrews football 
team, timing the swim team meets, and driving 
buses for Andrews ISO sports and extra-cur-
ricular activities. 
He was known for his servant heart, incred-
ible work ethic, infectious smiles, and deep 
love for his wife Carol and his children and 
grandchildren. 
Andrews ISO and our communities across 
West Texas are mourning the loss of Mr. Bos-
well. 
Camille and I are sending our support and 
prayers to Andrews and to Mr. Boswell’s fam-
ily.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1303 
December 2, 2021 
Thirty years ago, Rosetta took a business 
risk to launch The Tribune in order to raise 
awareness of, and address issues facing, 
Black families. The Tennessee Tribune has 
become the state’s largest minority weekly 
newspaper, fearlessly speaking truth to power 
and highlighting stories too often ignored by 
other publishers. 
From joining the United States Navy to 
working alongside civil rights leaders including 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Z. Alexander 
Looby, Rosetta has always been an advocate 
for good on the right side of history. Before 
founding The Tennessee Tribune, she worked 
at the United States Civil Rights Commission 
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission. After arriving in Nashville, Rosetta 
founded the city’s Black Chamber of Com-
merce, which is still the preeminent resource 
for African American businesses in the area. 
It’s no surprise that Rosetta is known to many 
as the Queen of Jefferson Street, the historic 
center of Nashville’s African American commu-
nity. 
Rosetta’s lifetime of accomplishments is 
documented in HistoryMakers, an oral history 
collection of prominent African Americans. In 
2019, she received the Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the National Newspaper Pub-
lishers Association for her work with The Trib-
une. 
The Tennessee Tribune’s work is multi-di-
mensional. It has two stores in the Nashville 
International Airport so that most visitors to 
our state will see the importance and power 
that diversity has made in shaping our growing 
region. This progress would not have been 
possible without Rosetta and The Tribune. 
This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of 
The Tennessee Tribune and Rosetta’s dedica-
tion to championing the cause of civil rights 
and leadership of African Americans. Rosetta 
always makes our city, state, and country bet-
ter, and I am honored to call her a friend. I 
look forward to The Tribune’s next thirty years 
and many more decades after that.

CELEBRATING ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
OF DR. CHARLES TEAMER, SR. 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I want to recognize Dr. Charles C. 
Teamer, Sr. of New Orleans, Louisiana, a civic 
leader and accomplished banker in my district. 
He has been a role model, an educator, a 
businessman, and an inspirational mentor to 
myself and so many others over the years. 
Born on May 20, 1933 in Shelby, North 
Carolina, he received his B.S. degree from 
Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia in 
1954. He served in the U.S. Army from 1956 
to 1958, and later received his M.A. degree 
from the University of Nebraska and his Ph.D. 
degree from Tulane University in New Orle-
ans, Louisiana. 
Dr. Teamer has worked as a business man-
ager at several colleges and universities, ulti-
mately becoming the vice president of finance 
at Dillard University and was promoted to chief 
financial officer in 1968. In 1983, he was ap-
pointed by Governor David Treen as the first 
African American Commissioner for the Port of 
New Orleans. 
Dr. Teamer has been a proud member of 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. for 70 years 
and is a current member of the Sigma Lamb-
da chapter. From 1985 to 1988 he served as 
the Fraternity’s 27th general president. He is 
also a longtime member and former Grand 
Sire Archon of the Sigma Pi Phi. 
Dr. Teamer was co-founder and chairman of 
Dryades Savings Bank. After retiring from Dil-
lard University, Teamer led an investment 
partnership to open The Cotton Exchange and 
Holiday Inn Express Hotel in downtown New 
Orleans. He also served as president of the 
World Trade Center of New Orleans. 
From serving as executive director of the 
Amistad Research Center and a consultant to 
the U.S. Department of Education, Dr. Teamer 
has also held numerous board appointments. 
These included the Board of Education of the 
United Methodist Church, the National Asso-
ciation of Colleges and University Business 
Officers, the Ford Foundation, the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools, the 
Ochsner Medical Foundations, the Audubon 
Institute, and the Common Fund. He also 
served as chairman for the Urban League of 
Greater New Orleans, Harrah’s New Orleans 
Casino, the Metropolitan Area Committee, the 
Greater New Orleans Foundation and the 
United Way. 
Dr. Teamer was a member of the business 
and higher-education council for the University 
of New Orleans as well as served on the 
board of the Southern Education Foundation. 
This do-it-all man was also president of fiscal 
affairs at Dillard University and Clark Atlanta 
University and president of the Southern Asso-
ciation of College and University Business Of-
ficers. He served on the board of supervisors 
for the University of Louisiana System and for 
Tulane University. Dr. Teamer also had tenure 
as the Entergy New Orleans director. 
As you can see, Dr. Charles C. Teamer, Sr. 
is a busy man, and I am grateful that our 
paths have crossed so many times throughout 
his illustrious career. I want to express my 
thanks to him and his family, Linda Phoenix 
Teamer, Charles Jr., Roderick, and the late 
Mary and Cheryl Teamer, for all of the time 
and energy he has given to New Orleans. Dr. 
Teamer has given so much to the community 
he loves and has lifted up all boats with him 
as he achieved success. The entire state of 
Louisiana is grateful for his longtime work and 
service.

HONORING DR. MAXINE O’DELL 
GERNERT 
HON. CHARLES J. ‘‘CHUCK’’ 
FLEISCHMANN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Maxine O’Dell Gernert of 
Athens, Tennessee and recognize a lifetime of 
service to her community and our nation. Dr. 
Gernert retires from my Congressional staff 
today. 
Dr. Gernert obtained a BS in Education from 
the University of Tennessee and subsequently 
earned a Masters of Divinity from the Church 
of God School of Theology and a Doctorate of 
Ministries from Columbia Theological Semi-
nary. 
Dr. Gernert is an ordained minister, has 
taught at Lee University, and has spoken 
internationally for chaplain training. She per-
formed Clinical Pastoral Education training in 
hospitals and was interim director and chap-
lain for the Serenity Women’s Shelter in Knox-
ville, TN. 
Maxine has been married to Dr. John N. 
Gernert for over 50 years, and the two have 
three children and seven grandchildren. 
Maxine has been a pillar of public life in 
East Tennessee for over 30 years. She served 
as the Area 2 President for the National Fed-
eration of Republican Women and as Chair-
man for the McMinn County Republican Party 
for two terms. 
Dr. Gernert was recognized as the Ten-
nessee GOP Stateman of the Year for District 
2 in 2005 and received the Lincoln Award 
from the McMinn County Republican Party in 
2016. She was awarded the Extraordinary 
Leaders prize from the American Association 
of Physician Specialties in 2017. 
For the past twelve years, Maxine has 
worked as Field Representative, first in Ten-
nessee’s Second Congressional District for 
Congressman Jimmy Duncan, and since 2013 
on my staff in Tennessee’s Third Congres-
sional District. In this role, she has tirelessly 
served our great East Tennessee community 
helping countless individuals by providing con-
stituent services. 
Dr. Maxine Gernert has been an asset to 
East Tennessee and to me. Always positive 
and assertive, she has had a tremendous im-
pact on all those fortunate enough to know 
her. I will treasure my time spent with Maxine 
and know we will continue to cross paths in 
the many ways she remains engaged in our 
communities. I wish her all the best in a well- 
deserved retirement. 
God bless Maxine.

COMMEMORATING THE TUNA 
CANYON DETENTION STATION 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Tuna Canyon Detention Sta-
tion Coalition as it commemorates the 80th 
anniversary of the opening of the detention 
station located in Tujunga, California. I com-
mend the organization’s tireless efforts to pre-
serve and document the historical site and the 
stories of the lives that were forever changed 
while they were detailed at the Tuna Canyon 
Detention Station (TCDS) during World War II. 
At the onset of World War II, Presidential 
Proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527 author-
ized the arrest and imprisonment of people 
deemed a threat to U.S. national security. The 
proclamations served as justification to arrest 
individuals of Japanese, German, and Italian 
ancestry along with extradited Japanese Peru-
vians and detain them without due process. 
The U.S. Department of Justice subse-
quently appropriated a Civilian Conservation 
Corps camp a week after the bombing of 
Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 which they 
would then transform into the detention station 
that we know today as TCDS. From Decem-
ber 16, 1941 to October 30, 1943, the Tuna

2,000 individuals. These individuals included 
prominent businessmen, martial arts teachers, 
civic and religious leaders. 
Today, the TCDS Coalition serves to edu-
cate the public about the site’s historical sig-
nificance, preserve the site and historic arti-
facts, and seek out the names and stories of 
detainees. I applaud the diligence of the 
TCDS Board of Directors and volunteers who 
have worked tirelessly to document biog-
raphies of TCDS detainees. Additionally, 
TCDS Coalition was the driving force behind 
the Los Angeles City Council recognizing the 
Tuna Canyon Detention Station as a Historic 
Cultural Monument on June 25, 2013. 
With only the oak trees left standing, it’s 
vital for present and future generations to be 
informed of these wartime atrocities to ensure 
that the same actions never take place again. 
It is my pleasure to congratulate the Tuna 
Canyon Detention Station Coalition on all they 
have accomplished, and I ask all members to 
join me in commending their efforts.

Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of World War II veteran, 
Roland Eugene Dullnig, who hails from my 
hometown of San Antonio, Texas. Today 
marks Mr. Dullnig’s 100th birthday. I am hon-
ored to recognize his milestone on this joyous 
day. 
Roland Eugene Dullnig was born in San An-
tonio, Texas, on December 3, 1921. The eld-
est of three children, Mr. Dullnig graduated 
from Fox Tech High School whereafter he en-
listed in U.S. Army Air Corp in 1942. Mr. 
Dullnig served as a Crew Chief with the 668th 
Squadron of the 416th Bombardment Group 
maintaining the A20 and the A26 light bomber 
aircraft. His 416th Bombardment Group partici-
pated in the battles of Normandy, Northern 
France, Ardennes, Rhineland, Central Europe, 
and Air Offensive Europe. Mr. Dullnig contin-
ued to serve until the end of the war, being 
discharged as a Technical Sergeant in Janu-
ary 1946. 
Upon completion of military service, Mr. 
Dullnig returned to San Antonio and worked in 
the printing trade for 40 years. He was mar-
ried to his wife, Evelyn, for almost 69 years 
having two children, Carolyn, and Ron. In Feb-
ruary 2020, Mr. Dullnig was presented with the 
French Legion of Honor Medal given by the 
people of France to American Veterans who 
fought for the liberation of France during 
World War II. Today, Mr. Dullnig continues to 
reside in the family home in San Antonio. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing World War II veteran, Mr. Roland 
Dullnig, on his 100th birthday. I thank Mr. 
Dullnig for his many years of service to our 
country and community. It is my hope that he 
is surrounded by loved ones on his special 
day. 
HONORING HOSPITALITY PROFES-
SIONAL OF THE YEAR AWARD 
RECIPIENT BABETTE HUITT AND 
UNSUNG HERO AWARD RECIPI-
ENT LINDA BROWN 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Babette Huitt for her recognition as 
Hospitality Professional of the Year and Linda 
Brown for her recognition as Unsung Hero by 
the Cabarrus County Convention and Visitors 
Bureau (CCCVB). 
The Hospitality Professional of the Year 
Award is presented to an individual who con-
tributes exceptional leadership and commit-
ment to the hospitality industry. As Tours and 
STEAM Program Manager for CCCVB, Ba-
bette Huitt exhibited outstanding leadership 
and commitment to the industry by rede-
signing the Speedway Tour program to ac-
commodate important COVID–19 Safety Pro-
tocols, and she provided necessary oversight 
to see the Bureau’s STEAM program imple-
mented in at-home and remote environments 
at both Fort Bragg and Camp LeJeune. 
The Unsung Hero Award is presented by 
CCCVB to an individual who conducts indis-
pensable duties behind the scenes to assure 
high-quality guest services. As a laundry at-
tendant within the Housekeeping Department 
at the Great Wolf Lodge in Concord, North 
Carolina, Linda Brown has performed out-
standing leadership and teamwork to see her 
duties executed acutely and efficiently. When 
she has time, she goes the extra mile to assist 
other attendants with their own tasks. Perhaps 
most impressively, Ms. Brown refuses to let 
her hearing deficiency inhibit her ability to 
work and has taught coworkers hand signals 
and sign language to assure coherent commu-
nication. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Ms. Huitt and Ms. Brown for their 
exemplary service to the hospitality industry in 
Cabarrus County. I know I speak for our entire 
community in wishing them continued success 
and happiness. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Babette Huitt and Linda Brown 
for their recognition by the Cabarrus County 
Convention and Visitors Bureau.

RECOGNIZING FBI SPECIAL AGENT 
BRENDAN J. O’LEARY 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate and honor the service of 
newly retired FBI Special Agent (SA) Brendan 
J. O’Leary. SA O’Leary dedicated 22 years of 
his life to the FBI and served his country with 
distinction. Brendan was born and raised in 
Chicago and received his undergraduate de-
gree from the University of Illinois at Urbana- 
Champaign and his law degree from the John 
Marshall—UIC School of Law. Prior to joining 
the FBI, Brendan served honorably as an As-
sistant State’s Attorney with the Cook County 
State’s Attorney’s office prosecuting criminal 
cases. After being selected into the FBI, SA 
O’Leary spent most of his career in the Chi-
cago Field office investigating and overseeing 
public corruption cases, 
In 1999, SA O’Leary began his FBI career 
in the Las Vegas Division where he quickly 
established himself as a competent and hard-
working agent. He was immediately assigned 
to a significant public corruption investigation 
in which business owners were bribing elected 
county commissioners and other public offi-
cials in return for official acts intended to ham-
per investigations of their businesses. The 
case was named ‘‘Operation G-Sting’’ and it 
ended up being the largest and most com-
prehensive public corruption case in the his-
tory of Nevada. In 2004, after a successful as-
signment in Las Vegas, SA O’Leary trans-
ferred to the Chicago Division and was as-
signed to a public corruption squad, where he 
used his experience to address the systemic 
corruption in the City of Chicago, Cook Coun-
ty, and the State of Illinois. 
In 2012, SA O’Leary became the Super-
visory Special Agent (SSA) for WC–2. As the 
SSA, he oversaw a number of high-profile 
public corruption investigations. These inves-
tigations included cases involving members of 
the U.S. Congress, the Illinois State Legisla-
ture, the Chicago City Council, and other local 
politicians. Over the last two years, he was the 
acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge over 
the White-Collar Branch, and not only oversaw 
several cases involving complex financial 
crimes, health care fraud, and money laun-
dering investigations, but also very significant 
ongoing 
public 
corruption 
investigations. 
Throughout all of this, SA O’Leary continued 
to take an active role in cases, utilizing his ex-
perience and insight. He advocated on behalf 
of agents and programs and represented the 
FBI in a professional and intelligent manner 
when speaking to community groups or at 
school events. SA O’Leary not only had a pas-
sion for the public corruption program, but al-
ways followed the path of righteousness when 
fighting for the citizens of Chicago, the State 
of Illinois, and the United States of America. 
Agent O’Leary established a reputation for his 
relentless pursuit of justice and holding elect-
ed officials and government employees ac-
countable under the rule of law. 
Throughout the course of his 22 years, SA 
O’Leary was a reliable and steady leader who 
set a standard for excellence. Brendan J. 
O’Leary’s professional accomplishments were 
achieved with the loving support of his won-
derful wife Chris and their four beautiful 
daughters.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF DAVE FOSTER 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) 
Dave Foster who is retiring as the super-
intendent of the Andrew Johnson National His-
toric Site and the Andrew Johnson National 
Cemetery in Greeneville, Tennessee. 
Before joining the National Park Service in 
2009, he served twenty-one years in the 
United States Marine Corps with deployments 
to Kuwait, Iraq, and the Horn of Africa in sup-
port of the global war on terrorism. While in 
the military, he held leadership assignments at 
the company and battalion levels and retired 
at the rank of lieutenant colonel. 
Dave began his National Park Service ca-
reer as a subject-to-furlough maintenance 
worker at the Blue Ridge Parkway and has 
since served as a maintenance worker, utility 
systems operator, maintenance supervisor and 
facility manager on the Parkway. In 2014, he 
was selected by his peers to receive the class 
leadership award upon graduation from the 
Facility Manager Leaders Program. He at-
tributes his success to the professional and 
dedicated teams he has worked with both at 
the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Andrew 
Johnson Historical Site. He said, ‘‘as a vet-
eran, I am especially humbled by the privilege 
of overseeing one of the final resting places 
for our nation’s heroes.’’ 
Born in western North Carolina, Dave holds 
a bachelor’s degree in education from the Uni-
versity of South Carolina and a master’s de-
gree in national security and strategic studies 
from the Naval War College. He and his wife 
Terri reside in Bedford, VA, and they have two 
children: Autumn and Brian. 
Madam Speaker, Dave Foster, has served 
our country faithfully, first as a Marine across 
the world and later as an exemplary employee 
and leader in our National Park Service. I 
thank him for his service and congratulate him 
on his upcoming retirement in January of 
2022.

RECOGNIZING THE ROTARY CLUB 
OF HARTFORD CITY 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Rotary Club of Hartford 
City as it celebrates its centennial anniversary. 
Since receiving its charter in 1920, the Ro-
tary Club of Hartford City has been serving 
Hartford City, Blackford County, and greater 
Indiana through time, hard work, and re-
sources. 
While its 100th year celebration was de-
layed by the pandemic, the club continued to 
place ‘‘Service Above Self’’ over the last year 
and half. Local organizations like this club 
have been the backbone of our society 
through this trial allowing America to weather 
this storm together. 
I thank the Rotary Club of Hartford City for 
continuing to ‘‘serve best’’. 
Again, my congratulations to the Rotary 
Club of Hartford City. Hoosiers are grateful for 
its kindness and generosity over the last cen-
tury, and for centuries to come. 
HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
PASTOR BYRON JONES 
HON. LANCE GOODEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Pastor Byron (Boonie) 
Jones of First Baptist Church in Gun Barrel 
City, Texas, on his retirement. During his thir-
ty-five years of service, Byron has been a stal-
wart of the community, always putting others’ 
needs before his own. 
Byron first joined the Ministry in 1979 at 
Eastside Baptist Church in Rusk, Texas and 
served on staff for three years before joining 
as Youth Minister at First Baptist Church, 
Gresham. In 1985, the First Baptist Church 
Gun Barrel City was fortunate to have Byron 
join as Pastor. When Byron first came to Gun 
Barrel City, the church was meeting in a city 
council meeting room until they were able to 
build a house of worship. Now, the First Bap-
tist Church in Gun Barrel City, Texas, is one 
of the largest churches in Henderson County. 
After 35 years of service, Pastor Byron 
Jones more than deserves a peaceful retire-
ment, and I wish him the best. 
I commend Pastor Byron Jones for his dedi-
cation to serving the people of Texas, and I 
know the First Baptist Church in Gun Barrel 
City will be sad to see him go.

RECOGNIZING SPECIALIST LUCAS 
SCHMITZ’S 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
HON. MICHELLE FISCHBACH 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Retired Specialist 
Lucas Schmitz who sustained severe injuries 
while heroically serving the United States as 
part of the Minnesota Army National Guard. 
Specialist Schmitz has spent his life serving 
others. In 2005, Schmitz was deployed to Iraq 
with the Minnesota Army National Guard as 
an Infantryman with the Second Combined 
Arms Battalion of the 34th Infantry Division. 
On July 25, 2006, the vehicle that Specialist 
Schmitz’s was riding in hit an IED, forcing 
them to vacate it. While running to the next 
vehicle, Specialist Schmitz was injured by 
stepping on a second IED and tragically lost 
his right leg. 
Upon his medical discharge from the Min-
nesota Army National Guard, Schmitz moved 
back to his hometown of Perham, Minnesota 
where he now lives with his wife, Tina, and 
three children. He has continued with his com-
mitment to helping others by teaching special 
education at Perham Public Schools. Sur-
rounded by the support of his family and com-
munity, Schmitz will receive a new home from 
the organization Homes For Our Troops that is 
specifically designed to accommodate the 
needs resulting from his injuries. 
I 
am 
eternally 
grateful 
for 
Specialist 
Schmitz’s dedication to our Nation, and the 
sacrifices the men and women in the military 
make every day as they risk their lives to keep 
us safe. On behalf of Minnesota and the

PLUM HOLLOW COUNTRY CLUB 
100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, today I 
recognize the historic Plum Hollow Country 
Club which has been a staple in the Metro De-
troit community as one of the premier country 
clubs in the Midwest since 1921, and is now 
celebrating its 100th anniversary. 
Plum Hollow Country Club has been known 
to have a world-class golf course, playing host 
to several national events and tournaments in-
cluding its very first PGA Championship in 
1947. For a century, Plum Hollow Country 
Club has worked tirelessly to provide an inclu-
sive environment for members of all skill levels 
to enjoy a great golf experience. 
Plum Hollow Country Club continuously 
works to offer a variety of member options to 
provide a comprehensive and diverse club for 
networking and more. Plum Hollow also pro-
vides a strong community service element 
through its well-known Caddie Program that 
allows for younger generations to grow and 
learn in the game of golf. 
Plum Hollow Country Club is indeed an inte-
gral part of the Southfield community, a place 
that noticeably touched the lives of each mem-
ber over the last 100 years in concrete ways 
and will continue to do so for years to come. 
On this momentous occasion, I wish to pro-
claim Plum Hollow Country Club as an Amer-
ican Landmark Site of Distinction. On behalf of 
the United States of America, I salute them for 
their many years of faithful service and cele-
brating 100 years.

SAFEGUARD TRIBAL OBJECTS OF 
PATRIMONY ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 1, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker. I rise today in 
support of H.R. 2930, the Safeguard Tribal 
Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act, which I co-
sponsored, especially as it ensures we fully in-
clude Native Hawaiians in all aspects of cul-
tural heritage repatriation. 
The STOP Act reauthorizes and makes im-
portant improvements to the Native American 
Graves 
Protection 
and 
Repatriation 
Act 
(NAGPRA) to protect the cultural patrimony of 
our Indigenous communities, including Native 
Hawaiians, the indigenous peoples of our 
country who originate in Hawaii. This bipar-
tisan effort, spearheaded by Chair TERESA 
LEGER FERNANDEZ and Ranking Member DON 
YOUNG of our House Natural Resources Sub-
committee on Indigenous Peoples, on which I 
also serve, will assist our efforts to ensure the 
survival of Native artifacts for generations to 
come. 
I also wish to memorialize for the record our 
committee discussions assuring that Native 
Hawaiians are directly involved in all cultural 
heritage repatriation processes mandated by 
Congress under NAGPRA, including full and 
direct presence on the NAGPRA Review Com-
mittee. 
Religious practices of American Indians, 
Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians are an 
integral part of their culture, tradition and herit-
age. They also serve as a basis of Native 
identity and value systems. Congress has es-
tablished a long-standing policy under the 
American 
Indian 
Religious 
Freedom 
Act 
(AIRFA) of 1978 (Pub. L. No. 95–341) and 
other legislation (25 U.S.C. § 1996) to protect 
and preserve the inherent right of freedom to 
believe, express and exercise the traditional 
religions of American Indians, Alaska Natives 
and Native Hawaiians. 
Under NAGPRA, a review committee that 
consists of seven members is appointed by 
the Secretary of the Interior and tasked with 
several responsibilities, including consultation 
with Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian organi-
zations, working with the Secretary to develop 
regulations to carry out NAGPRA and making 
recommendations regarding future care of re-
patriated cultural items. At least two of these 
members must be traditional Indian religious 
leaders. The use of ‘‘traditional Indian religious 
leader’’ in NAGPRA (25 U.S.C. 3006) is con-
sistent with the policy described in AIRFA (42 
U.S.C. § 1996) and includes and should con-
tinue to include all traditional Native American 
religious leaders, including Native Hawaiians, 
as defined by the term ‘‘Native American’’ 
found at 25 U.S.C. § 3001. 
Ensuring the eligibility of any American In-
dian, Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian tradi-
tional religious leader to be nominated to 
serve on the NAGPRA Review Committee is 
critical to full implementation of the letter and 
spirit of NAGPRA and the preservation and 
safe return of our precious indigenous cultural 
heritage.

HONORING THE LANSING CHAPTER 
OF 
THE 
DAUGHTERS 
OF 
THE 
AMERICAN REVOLUTION 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Lan-
sing Chapter of the National Society Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution. 
Originally chartered with just 17 members 
on December 3, 1896, the organization now 
lists 135 women actively committed to pro-
moting patriotism, preserving American his-
tory, and securing a better future for our na-
tion’s children through education. 
Throughout its existence, the DAR ladies— 
as they affectionately call themselves—have 
supported civic works throughout the Greater 
Lansing area. In 2007, the Lansing DAR chap-
ter supported WKAR in the making of the 
award-winning documentary, ‘‘The War: Michi-
gan Voices,’’ a local companion to the land-
mark Ken Burns series. 
They often present flags to new American 
citizens and deliver copies of the Pledge of Al-
legiance to local schools. Service is an impor-
tant common thread among the Lansing DAR 
ladies, with many of them serving or having 
served our country in the armed forces. In ad-
dition, they recognize a top cadet each year 
from the Army ROTC and Air Force ROTC 
programs at Michigan State University, as well 
as the local U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps. 
The Lansing chapter has itself been recog-
nized for its work in the community—in 2000, 
it won Michigan Outstanding Chapter Regent 
at the state level and was awarded National 
Outstanding School Chair at the DAR’s na-
tional meeting, the Continental Congress, in 
2006. 
Today, after more than a century of uplifting 
each other and the Michiganders who call 
Lansing home, the Chapter continues to sup-
port community service, good citizenship, 
scholarship, veterans assistance, literacy, and 
so much more. In support of Wreaths Across 
America, you can consistently find Lansing 
Chapter members laying wreaths at veterans’ 
graves, furthering their mission of ‘‘Remember, 
Teach, and Honor.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the Lansing Chapter of the 
Daughter of the American Revolution has 
been remembering, teaching, and honoring for 
125 years. It’s my great privilege today to cel-
ebrate them by submitting these words to the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD so that future gen-
erations—those in the 125 years to come— 
may learn about their dedicated service to oth-
ers.

Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and congratulate Mrs. Nancy Parra- 
Quinlan for being named the 2022 Arizona 
Teacher of the Year by the Arizona Edu-
cational Foundation. Mrs. Parra-Quinlan, a 7th 
and 8th grade teacher at Kino Junior High in 
the Mesa Public Schools district, has inspired 
her students over her 27-year career to reach 
for the stars and create a better and brighter 
future for our state. 
School year after school year, Mrs. Parra- 
Quinlan has distinguished herself as a unique-
ly gifted and hardworking educator. She has 
revolutionized STEM education in the Mesa 
Public School District and has selflessly 
served our community both inside and outside 
of the classroom. Her lessons expose her stu-
dents to valuable real-world skills in a rapidly 
evolving technology industry throughout Ari-
zona. Mrs. Parra-Quinlan has sponsored and 
directed incredible programs like the STEM In-
stitute for Manufacturing and Innovation, and 
Mesa Public School’s Aerospace Academy. 
Through it all, she finds time to volunteer with 
the Civil Air Patrol as a statewide Assistant Di-
rector of Aerospace Education and with the 
305th Squadron at Falcon Field in Mesa as 
the Aerospace Education Office. 
Mrs. Parra-Quinlan is an exemplary advo-
cate for girls, students of color, and all stu-
dents who are underrepresented in STEM, 
and is helping create a more diverse and equi-
table future for Arizona. By innovating and ex-
panding the kinds of courses and activities of-
fered at Mesa Public Schools, she opens new

and making the field more inclusive and rep-
resentative of our ever diverse and vibrant 
community. 
I am beyond proud to honor Mrs. Parra- 
Quinlan for her remarkable service and as-
tounding legacy at Kino Junior High School. 
Mrs. Parra-Quinlan cares deeply about her 
work, students, coworkers, and our state. She 
chose to become a teacher to inspire the next 
generation and change the lives of her stu-
dents—and we are all grateful for her work as 
a teacher, role model, and mentor. I wish her 
and her students the very best as she con-
tinues to innovate, inspire, and shape a prom-
ising future for the STEM field, and the state 
of Arizona.

HONORING JOHN KARRAS AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the co-founder of RAGBRAI John 
Karras as Iowan of the Week. RAGBRAI is the 
world’s oldest, largest, and longest rec-
reational bicycling tour event, and it is a be-
loved Iowa tradition. John, who was a feature 
writer for the Des Moines Register, took his 
first ride across Iowa with some friends in 
1973. They chronicled their journey, and that 
trip sparked the inspiration for what is now 
known as RAGBRAI—an acronym for the 
Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across 
Iowa. 
John died on November 10, 2021, but the 
bicycle ride he helped create will continue in 
Iowa in 2022 and for many more years. 
RAGBRAI attracts 15,000 people to Iowa 
every summer, and allows visitors to see the 
state’s beautiful cities, towns, counties, and 
countryside while riding their bikes an average 
of 468 miles between the Missouri and Mis-
sissippi rivers. 
RAGBRAI generates more than $364.8 mil-
lion annually for the State of Iowa. The week- 
long event also brings in nearly $25 million in 
direct spending, which means towns that are 
lucky enough to have RAGBRAI ride through 
see upwards of $3 million a day in tourism 
spending. That money means so much to the 
Iowa towns that host RAGBRAI each year, 
and to the vendors that help support the bicy-
cle ride. 
The ride does more than raise money for 
our great state. It brings bicyclists from all 
over Iowa, the nation, and the world together 
to share their love of their favorite sport and 
pastime. It has created friendly rivalries be-
tween news organizations as they compete to 
see who can eat pies the fastest, and good 
laughs for everyone as the bicyclists have 
come up with some memorably humorous 
team names throughout the years. 
I’ve had the pleasure of riding RAGBRAI 
and can honestly say there’s no experience 
quite like it. I loved spending time in rural 
areas along the route, meeting Iowans and 
out-of-state riders to hear their stories, and the 
physical challenge of a cross-state ride. You 
have to push yourself through the unpredict-
able weather of an Iowa summer and the hilly 
landscape, but you’re rewarded with seeing 
and experiencing the state’s beauty from a 
unique perspective. RAGBRAI is a great way 
to connect with family, friends, and strangers 
alike while making memories that last a life-
time. John leaves a lasting legacy through the 
creation of this iconic event. 
John certainly didn’t know what RAGBRAI 
would grow into when he took his first bicycle 
ride across the state, but I am so thankful he 
went out anyway and tried something new. 
Iowa summers would not be the same without 
this phenomenal tradition and John will be 
missed by everyone who knows and loves 
RAGBRAI. It is my pleasure to honor John 
Karras as Iowan of the Week.

HONORING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY 
OF MIRIAM KELLER SIEFKEN 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the 100th 
birthday of Miriam Keller Siefken. Born on De-
cember 2, 1921, Mrs. Siefken grew up in Ab-
ington, Pennsylvania and was a graduate of 
Abington High School. She then raised her 
three children, Barbara, Edward and Larry with 
her late husband, Edward A. Siefken. Edward 
was a United States Army Veteran and served 
in the 9th Armored Division and the 52nd Ar-
mored Infantry Battalion. He also served at the 
Battle of the Bulge and Remagen Bridge and 
attained the rank of Sergeant. Together they 
raised a wonderful family. She is a proud 
grandmother of four as well as a great grand-
mother of three. 
Today, our community is celebrating Mrs. 
Siefken’s birthday at Neshaminy Manor. We 
wish her well in the upcoming year and for 
many years to come. I ask that my colleagues 
join me in wishing a Happy Birthday to Mrs. 
Siefken and a profound thank you for her con-
tributions to our community.

RECOGNIZING MR. LARRY J. MIL-
LER’S 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
PEOPLESBANK 
UPON 
HIS 
50 
YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to recognize Mr. Larry J. Miller’s retirement 
upon his 50 years of dedication and service to 
PeoplesBank, a Codorus Valley Company and 
its community. On December 31, 2021, Mr. 
Miller will retire from the Codorus Valley 
Bancorp, Inc. Board of Directors, the parent 
company of PeoplesBank. 
On 
March 
1, 
1971, 
Larry 
joined 
PeoplesBank (then known as Peoples Bank of 
Glen Rock) as a management trainee. He was 
the youngest person to serve as a bank presi-
dent in Pennsylvania when he became Presi-
dent of the bank at age 30 in 1981. He served 
in that role until 2016. In addition, he has 
served as director, President and Chief Execu-
tive Officer of Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc. 
from 1986 to October 1, 2021. His 50 years of 
service to PeoplesBank, the community and 
the banking industry has been nothing short of 
remarkable. 
When Larry Miller was hired, the bank had 
three branch locations and managed $23 mil-
lion in assets. During his tenure, the bank’s 
assets grew to over $2 billion. He led 
PeoplesBank’s growth to become the largest 
bank with headquarters in York County. As 
CEO, he led the opening of 25, the relocation 
of four, the combining of one and the closure 
of three locations. In addition, he oversaw the 
purchase of two insurance companies, the 
creation of the mortgage and trust divisions, 
the development of corporate and administra-
tive centers and the acquisition of four branch 
banks in Maryland. Fourteen limited-service 
facilities were also opened throughout his ten-
ure. 
His dedication to and impact on York Coun-
ty is evident through his active involvement in 
the community, as he serves on various non- 
profit boards of directors in leadership capac-
ities. Throughout his tenure, he has served as 
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the 
United Way of York County, the York County 
Economic 
Development 
Corporation, 
YorkCounts, the Cultural Alliance of York 
County, and Wellspan Heath System. 
Larry has been honored for his achieve-
ments and contributions through several rec-
ognition awards, including the York County 
Economic Alliance’s Business Achievement 
Award, the Southern School District Founda-
tion’s distinguished Leader Award, the 2021 
Distinguished Humanitarian Award Honoree by 
Penn-Mar Human Services, and his induction 
into the Central Penn Business Hall of Fame. 
I am proud to honor Mr. Larry J. Miller and 
recognize his important contributions to our 
communities throughout his five decades of 
leadership in York County and the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. I wish him God’s 
many blessings as he embarks upon his next 
adventure.

Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Floyd Nesse for his lifelong service 
to individuals with disabilities in NJ–11 and be-
yond. 
Mr. Nesse organized efforts throughout New 
Jersey to reduce barriers and broaden protec-
tions for people with disabilities. He was par-
ticularly committed to expanding access to ful-
filling and accommodating employment oppor-
tunities. He brought the concerns of the dis-
ability community to the attention of the fed-
eral government, traveling down here to our 
nation’s capital to advocate for legislation to 
improve the quality of life for those with dis-
abilities. 
Mr. Nesse was deeply admired by his peers 
and

empathetically and effectively. He was recog-
nized for his service in 2019 and was awarded 
the Unsung Hero Award from Inroads to Op-
portunities and the Larry Barker Spirit of State 
Use Award from the State Use Programs As-
sociation. 
Over the course of his career, Mr. Nesse 
served as the Executive Director of the Edison 
Sheltered Workshop, the President and CEO 
of the Center for Vocational Rehabilitation, 
and most recently as the Vice President of 
Government Affairs for ACCSES New Jersey. 
Beyond his advocacy, Mr. Nesse was a car-
ing husband, father, and grandfather, finding 
great joy in spending time with his family. He 
was also a man of deep faith, and on Sun-
days, you could find him with a guitar in hand 
leading the worship team at his local con-
gregation. 
Floyd Nesse passed away on October 19, 
2021. His legacy will live on in his family and 
in the lives of all he served. I am grateful for 
all Mr. Nesse did to ensure we live in more in-
clusive communities. He will be dearly missed.

HONORING OUTSTANDING AMBAS-
SADOR OF THE YEAR AWARD 
RECIPIENT 
NORTH 
CAROLINA 
SENATOR PAUL NEWTON 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor North Carolina Senator Paul Newton 
for his recognition as Outstanding Ambas-
sador of the Year by the Cabarrus County 
Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
Outstanding Ambassador of the Year is pre-
sented by the Cabarrus County Convention 
and Visitors Bureau to an individual who rep-
resents Cabarrus County by providing excep-
tional service to visitors. Working in coordina-
tion with the North Carolina Travel Industry 
Association, Senator Newton’s leadership ef-
fectuated the inclusion of a specific provision 
in House Bill 196 that makes tourism develop-
ment authorities in North Carolina eligible for 
the federal Payroll Protection Program (PPP). 
This quick and impactful response to the eco-
nomic struggles brought on by the COVID–19 
Pandemic has effectively reduced layoffs and 
allowed businesses in the hospitality and tour-
ism industries to remain economically stable 
so they may continue providing services to 
visitors and all members of their communities. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Senator Newton for his exem-
plary service to the tourism and hospitality in-
dustries in Cabarrus County and North Caro-
lina as a whole. It is an honor and a privilege 
to serve and represent the people of Cabarrus 
County by his side. I know I speak for our en-
tire community in wishing him continued suc-
cess and happiness. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Senator Paul Newton as the 
Cabarrus County Convention and Visitors Bu-
reau Outstanding Ambassador of the Year 
Award recipient and wish him well as he con-
tinues to address the needs of his constitu-
ency.

HONORING DARIN JOHNS 
HON. AUGUST PFLUGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer sympathy and prayer to the 
community of Andrews, as well as the family 
of Darin Johns, who was tragically killed in a 
bus crash while traveling with the Andrews 
High School Band to a Mustangs playoff game 
two weeks ago. 
Darin Johns was the beloved band director 
for Andrews High School. In the weeks since 
the accident, we have seen an outpouring of 
testimonies about Mr. Johns from former stu-
dents, friends, colleagues, and other band di-
rectors across the entire state of Texas. 
As I learn more about the life that Mr. Johns 
led, I am continually encouraged by the quality 
of service that he gave to his community and 
the quantity of people whose lives he touched. 
Mr. Johns was an active member of the An-
drews community who dedicated his life to his 
faith, loved his wife Karen and family and 
friends deeply, and invested in his natural tal-
ent and deep love of music. He was a gifted 
musician who could play almost any instru-
ment he touched. In his free time, he played 
in a Christian band and directed the church 
praise band as an active member of the Cal-
vary Baptist Church. 
Mr. Johns deepest passion was encour-
aging the younger generations. For over 30 
years, he taught others to love music as a 
high school band director. Over his impressive 
tenure, Mr. Johns led three different high 
school marching bands to the State Marching 
Contest. He lent all his time and energy to 
building up the dreams and talents of those 
around him. 
Andrews ISD and our communities across 
West Texas are mourning the loss of Mr. 
Johns. 
Camille and I are sending our support and 
prayers to Andrews and Mr. Johns’ family.

RECOGNIZING BONNY CLARK ON 
BEING NAMED A SAGAMORE OF 
THE WABASH 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor my constituent Bonny Clark of Pen-
dleton, Indiana, on being named a Sagamore 
of the Wabash. The Sagamore of the Wabash 
is one of the highest civilian honors the Gov-
ernor of Indiana can bestow upon citizens. 
Bonny is the most recent recipient of this pres-
tigious award. 
Bonny has been a selfless servant to the 
people of central Indiana and has had an in-
delible and personal impact on countless Hoo-
siers. Receiving this high honor is only a small 
reward for the great amount she has done for 
her neighbors and community. Bonny is an in-
spiration to others to serve, sacrifice, and get 
involved in meaningful ways at the local level. 
I join Governor Holcomb and our fellow 
Hoosiers in congratulating Bonny Clark on this 
prestigious recognition.

GOVERNOR’S AWARD FOR

HON. J. FRENCH HILL

Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the companies ECOJOHN and 
Leather Brothers, recipients of the Governor’s

This award recognizes companies that have 
experienced success in international markets

lence. 
ECOJOHN is a manufacturing company 
from North Little Rock, specializing in waste-
water management solutions. 
Leather Brothers are third-generation leather 
workers from Conway who manufacture high 
quality pet products. 
Both of these companies overcame adver-
sity caused by the COVID–19 pandemic and 
continued to succeed in a global market. 
I am proud of our local companies, their 
success, and their impact on our global mar-
kets.

LEE 
ELDER: 
GROUNDBREAKING 
GOLFER, MAKING A FAIR WAY 
ON THE FAIRWAYS 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 2, 2021 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, throughout 
my years in Congress, I have found it is not 
often that someone is as impactful or influen-
tial in breaking the color barrier in a sport or 
changing the culture of country clubs as the 
person for whom I stand today. I am honored 
to rise to recognize someone who found a 
more fair way on the fairways of professional 
golf; from Pensacola, Florida to Johannesburg, 
South Africa all the way to Augusta National 
and 
many 
courses 
in 
between, 
this 
groundbreaking golfer recently passed away. 
This incredible ambassador for the game was 
a gentleman both on the links and in real life, 
Mr. Lee Elder. 
With 16 professional tour wins, including his 
breakthrough at the Monsanto Open in Pensa-
cola in 1974, Lee Elder was the first African 
American to win a PGA Tour event. Mr. Elder 
was, however, a champion in more ways than 
one. He was a Black man born in the Jim 
Crow South who taught himself how to play 
golf on segregated courses. Working as a 
caddy he surmounted the hardships of being 
orphaned at a young age. In his early golfing 
days in the United Golf Association, Lee 
gained prominence for his skill and approach 
to the game. 
Much like Jackie Robinson in Major League 
Baseball, Mr. Elder who chose to stand 
against the stain of racism, had to endure 
many indignities. He broke through on the 
PGA Tour in 1968 as a 34-year-old golfer. 
From changing clothes in parking lots because 
Black people were not allowed in the club-
house to getting death threats for playing in 
the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, he overcame 
obstacles. He went to South Africa during the 
height of apartheid. He protested PGA rules 
allowing 
golfers 
to 
play 
at 
Sun 
City, 
Bophutswana, an outpost for segregation. He 
spoke out against country clubs which still ex-
cluded Black players as late as 1990. Mr. 
Elder helped Black golfers for whom he cre-
ated Summer Youth Development Programs. 
All these acts define a champion of civil rights. 
I stand today, Madam Speaker, for Lee 
Elder, not only for his dedication to the game 
of golf but also for his outstanding commit-
ment in paving the way for people of color to 
pursue their passions in both their studies and 
their sports. Using his fame and fortune to es-
tablish a foundation to help Black students 
and the United Negro College Fund is also an 
important part of his legacy. Standing on the 
shoulders of such an athlete shows us what 
we all know in our hearts to be true: without 
the likes of Lee Elder, there might not be a 
Tiger Woods nor entry into Country Clubs. Mr. 
Eider’s efforts yielded a fairer way on all fair-
ways across this land.
