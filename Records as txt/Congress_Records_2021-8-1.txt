PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr.

f 
THANKING STAFF 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know a 
lot of negotiations have been going on 
in the bill that is soon to be before us, 
and I appreciate the Senators from 
both parties who have done that, but 
sometimes we forget that there are 
hundreds of other people who work on 
it. 
I know the members of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee have been 
working extremely hard. I think of 
people—Chuck 
Kieffer, 
Chanda 
Betourney, Jessica Berry, and others in 
our committee—who have given up 
weekends, evenings. They were work-
ing and briefing me until last evening 
on the work they were doing because 
we can say what we want to do, but 
then you have got to write it down. 
The same thing happened with the 
bill that, fortunately, passed unani-
mously here to reimburse our National 
Guard, to pay the backpay and other 
necessities of the Capitol Police, to try 
to repair the damage and improve the 
situation after what happened—the ter-
rible things that happened on January 
6—to go for higher protections of 
COVID for everybody who works here 
in the Capitol: the staff, professionals, 
everybody. This is from those who 
clean the Capitol to those who guard 
the Capitol; they all need this kind of 
protection. 
And with the help of JEANNE SHA-
HEEN and others, we were able to put in 
additional money and changes in the 
law to help us bring translators back 
from Afghanistan, people who had 
worked and put their lives on the line 
for our military, and bring them to 
safety. 
As soon as, first, President Trump 
and then President Biden said we are 
leaving, their lives and the lives of 
their families were greatly endangered 
by the Taliban, and now they are back. 
But I mention that because some-
times I might say, only half in jest, 
that Senators are merely constitu-
tional impediments to their staffs, but 
we are very fortunate to have some of 
the brightest women and men any-
where in the staffs of the Senators in 
both parties, and certainly in those 
who administer the Senate, including 
those who are presently sitting and 
preparing to help us on everything 
from points of order to making sure 
the right papers are done and that the 
votes are counted properly. 
I see all of these people working hard 
here today when I came into the Cap-
itol, everybody from those who have to 
follow and make a copy of what I say 
on the floor, on through. I didn’t hear 
anybody say: Boy, I wish I wasn’t here. 
I am sure just about everybody had 
other plans for Saturday and Sunday 
instead of being here. I think we owe a 
great debt of gratitude to those who

August 1, 2021 
have come here who are helping us per-
form our duties. And I hope that Sen-
ators on both sides of the aisle will 
take note of that, try to bring these 
things to a conclusion—of course, have 
whatever votes we need—but keep in 
mind that there are hundreds, thou-
sands of people working in the Capitol 
whose schedules are ofttimes disrupted 
because of our schedules. 
They do it. They help us. They sup-
port us. We could not do our job with-
out them. And I hope we will take note 
of that and help them in reaching a 
conclusion or at least give some final-
ity to what we are doing. 
I am willing to stay here whatever 
hours are necessary, but I am hoping 
that we will know what those hours are 
so that the hundreds, even thousands of 
other people who work here in the Cap-
itol can go about planning for them-
selves, their families, their friends, 
whatever need be. 
So I would note that both the distin-
guished Presiding Officer is here, and I 
am here in the Senate. I am not hold-
ing up anything because no other Sen-
ator is seeking recognition, but I hope 
this may be coming to a conclusion. 
With that, I will yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, from 
the very beginning, my stated goal for 
the July and August work period has 
been that the Senate pass both a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill and a budget 
resolution with reconciliation instruc-
tions. This is our so-called two-track 
strategy: both a bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill and a budget resolution with 
reconciliation instructions. And de-
spite some bumps in the road, always 
expected on two bills as large and com-
prehensive as these, we have remained 
firmly on track to achieve our two- 
track goal. 
On the bipartisan track, I have 
worked with my colleagues throughout 
the process to help produce an outcome 
that all parties find acceptable. I have 
tried to prod the negotiators when they 
have needed it and given them space 
when they have asked for it. 
Deadlines were necessary to advance 
the negotiations. We are here right 
now, during a rare weekend session, in 
order to move the bipartisan bill for-
ward as quickly as possible. 
The idea here is to produce an out-
come, a real bipartisan agreement that 
provides a significant down payment 
toward the level of infrastructure in-
vestment our country needs. 
The process from here is simple. Once 
the legislative text of the agreement is 
finalized—and I understand it is being 
finalized imminently—I will offer it as 
a substitute amendment, as I have al-
ways promised, and then the Senate 
can finally begin voting on additional 
amendments. 
Given the thoroughly bipartisan na-
ture of the bill, I expect we will be able 
to consider all the relevant amend-
ments and finish the bill in a matter of 
days. 
But we know that this bill is not ev-
erything our country needs. That is 
why, after the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture legislation passes this Chamber, I 
will immediately move to the other 
track: passing a budget resolution with 
reconciliation instructions, which will 
allow the Senate to make historic in-
vestments in American jobs, American 
families, and efforts to reverse climate 
change. Both tracks are very much 
needed by the American people and we 
must accomplish both. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is 
hard to keep up with Donald Trump, 
particularly his Big Lie. Like the 
coronavirus, it is constantly mutating. 
A couple days ago, I read that one of 
the most vocal competitors of that Big 
Lie, Mike Lindell, the MyPillow Guy, 
has pulled all his advertising from FOX 
News. Why? Because FOX refused to 
sell him airtime for a commercial re-
peating the dangerous, discredited lie 
that the Presidential election was sto-
len. It is hard to imagine what level of 
conspiracy craziness it takes for even 
FOX Network to say that goes too far, 
but we have reached that point when it 
comes to the MyPillow Guy. 
I don’t know how Mr. MyPillow is 
going to peddle his products now. 
Maybe he will stand on the street cor-
ner handing out flyers next to one of 
those blow-up, scarecrow balloons that 
gyrates wildly in the wind. At this 
point, it is hard to rule anything out. 
But there is another development on 
the Big Lie that is far darker and more 
disturbing. According to recent pub-
lished reports, former President Donald 
Trump is now denouncing the brave po-
lice officers who testified last week be-
fore the select committee in the House 
about the mob insurrection on January 
6 in this Chamber, in this Capitol. He is 
disparaging them with a word which I 
will not repeat. 
His attacks on these officers is rep-
rehensible and inexcusable and totally 
predictable. These officers and hun-
dreds more battled a murderous mob 
sent to the Capitol by President Don-
ald Trump to overturn an election. He 
sent that mob to attack this Capitol 
and American democracy because he 
couldn’t bear the shame of losing. He 
wanted to overturn the election and 
cling to power like a tin-pot dictator. 
The police officers he now denounces 
still bear the wounds from the insur-
rection he ordered. Some other Trump 
supporters have attacked at least one 
of the police officers who testified as a 
‘‘crisis actor.’’ 
This morning’s New York Times has 
an article by Maureen Dowd, which I 
would like to quote from. She is speak-
ing of Laura Ingraham, one of the po-
litical pundits on FOX Network. It 
says: 
Laura Ingraham even gave awards—‘‘Best 
Exaggerated Performance,’’ ‘‘Best Political 
Performance’’ . . . ‘’for the Performance in 
an Action Role’’—to the police who re-
counted their terrifying battles with the 
mob. ‘‘They came across as political actors,’’ 
Ingraham said. ‘‘That doesn’t help anything. 
We want the police to be just police.’’ 
Even as Ingraham was describing as ‘‘ac-
tors’’ those cops who faced danger, Erin 
Smith was trying to get the death of her hus-
band, a veteran Washington patrolman—the 
second officer to take his life after the insur-
rection—reclassified from a suicide to a 
death in the line of duty. 
After he was hit in the head with a metal 
pole during the rampage, he fell into a dark 
depression, his wife told The Times. On the 
way to his shift, he pulled his car off the 
George Washington Parkway and killed him-
self with his service weapon. 
More than casting the police who told 
their stories as drama queens and fabulists, 
four House Republicans, representing the 
‘‘dregs of Congress’’— 
In Maureen Dowd’s words— 
turned up at a Washington jail on Thurs-
day to shine a light on the plight of insurrec-
tion suspects. One of them, Representative 
PAUL GOSAR of Arizona, hailed them as ‘‘po-
litical prisoners.’’ 
Since when do Republicans care more 
about criminals in jail than the cops who put 
them there? Since when do they coddle do-
mestic terrorists? 
Since Donald Trump. 
There was a point decades ago where, 
in desperation to stop the ravings of a 
Senator from Wisconsin, a man named 
Joseph Welch said to the Senator: Have 
you no shame? At long last, have you 
no shame? 
That is what Joseph Welch famously 
asked Senator Joseph McCarthy when 
McCarthy tried to turn his vicious 
smear campaign against members of 
the U.S. Army after his lies had al-
ready broken the lives of so many 
Americans. 
Now an angry, embittered ex-Presi-
dent is turning his vicious smear tac-
tics against a different group of democ-
racy’s defenders. It is pointless to ask 
if the former President feels shame or 
decency or empathy. We learned long 
ago that he is incapable of such feel-
ings. 
So I ask my Republican colleagues: 
What do you say? At long last, will you

August 1, 2021 
tell the former President ‘‘enough’’? 
‘‘no more’’? ‘‘you have gone too far’’? 
‘‘this must stop’’? 
You were all here on January 6, as I 
was. You know those Capitol Police 
and Metropolitan Police risked their 
lives to defend you and me. Will you 
now defend them when they are being 
smeared so scandalously? 
We are here on a Sunday, working to 
pass a historic bipartisan plan to build 
the backbone of a strong 21st century 
economy that benefits all Americans. 
Can’t we also have a bipartisan back-
bone to defend the men and women who 
defended the Capitol on January 6? 
A few minutes ago, I walked into the 
building. They were there. You know 
they are going to be there to protect 
you, the men and women of the Capitol 
Police. Theirs is a dangerous job now, 
more dangerous because of January 6. 
We salute them for their bravery, and 
those who have questioned that brav-
ery have really gone too far. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on an-
other topic, the most frustrating as-
pect of America’s COVID response isn’t 
that we are being asked to wear masks 
again—I have my mask here—in COVID 
hotspots; the most maddening part of 
this pandemic is that Americans could 
have put this virus in their rearview 
mirror long ago. 
We could have saved thousands of 
lives. Over 600,000 Americans are dead 
from COVID–19. We could have pre-
vented a great deal of the economic 
pain this pandemic has inflicted on 
America’s families and businesses. We 
are here now, battling a new surge and 
a 
more 
dangerous 
strain 
of 
coronavirus, in large part, because the 
people with big megaphones chose, 
cynically and cowardly and cruelly, to 
spread doubt and denial about this 
virus and the vaccines that prevent it. 
Their lies cost lives. 
Fortunately, this past week seems to 
mark a turning point for America. 
Leaders in both the public and private 
sectors are stepping up for the common 
good and requiring their workers to get 
vaccinated or to get tested regularly to 
show they are not sick and not a dan-
ger to others. If you want the job, get 
the jab. It is time. 
President Biden also announced that 
all Federal workers must get vac-
cinated or tested. I commend his deci-
sion. That is leadership, and it will 
save lives. 
And to some who come to the floor of 
the Senate and to other places to say 
that the government should operate 
more like a business, take note: Some 
of the most innovative employers— 
Google, Netflix, Disney—have also an-
nounced that their workers will have 
to be vaccinated, and there will be 
more. 
Recently, several of our Republican 
colleagues took to the floor of the Sen-
ate. They even invited over their fan 
club from the House. They lined up 
right behind the speakers over on the 
Republican side of the aisle. And they 
are very strong in their feelings that 
the Speaker of the House should not re-
quire Members to wear masks. 
Well, there is a reason for it, and the 
suggestion that the CDC has flip- 
flopped or that Dr. Fauci has flip- 
flopped belies the reality that the virus 
has flip-flopped. We are now dealing 
with something known as a Delta vari-
ant. 
There is an urgent message for all 
Americans who have not been vac-
cinated: While you have been avoiding 
vaccination or waiting for just the 
right moment, the enemy—the COVID– 
19 virus—has not been idle. The Delta 
variant has arrived in a big and deadly 
way. 
Here is what Dr. Rochelle Walensky, 
the Director of the CDC, said: 
The Delta variant is more aggressive . . . 
more [transferable] than previously circu-
lating strains. It is one of the most infec-
tious respiratory [viruses] we know of . . . in 
my 20-year career. 
Now, 
in 
case 
you 
dismiss 
Dr. 
Walensky as some nonsense-talking 
Democratic Socialist and you prefer 
the expertise of Tucker Carlson or 
Laura Ingraham on FOX, I hope you 
will not ignore the grim reality in the 
actual numbers: Over 90 percent of 
those infected, hospitalized, and dying 
from the coronavirus Delta variant are 
unvaccinated—over 90 percent. People 
infected by the coronavirus Delta vari-
ant 
may 
carry 
1,000 
times—1,000 
times—as much virus and for a longer 
period of time as those who were in-
fected with the original coronavirus. 
Those infected were more than twice as 
likely to be hospitalized than those in-
fected by the original coronavirus. 
Vaccines still are effective against 
the Delta variant and coronavirus. But 
don’t believe, if you are unvaccinated, 
that you are safe around vaccinated 
people. Early new data shows that fully 
vaccinated people may be able to 
spread the Delta variant to others as 
readily as unvaccinated people. 
In fact, it gets down to the very ba-
sics: Until America decides to make 
vaccination part of our survival, we 
will continue, sadly, to witness infec-
tions; hospitalizations; and deaths and, 
God forbid, more variants. 
Leaders in both public and private 
sectors are stepping up. We should too. 
People should be tested regularly, if 
they insist on not being vaccinated, to 
show that they are not sick and not a 
danger to others. The COVID vaccines 
are safe, free, readily available, and al-
most miraculously effective, and they 
are the way out of this pandemic. 
One more point about COVID protec-
tion: Many on the right are spitting 
mad and filled with feigned confusion 
about the CDC’s new guidance urging 
people in COVID hotspots to wear 
masks indoors even if you are vac-
cinated. 
They say: How can we trust an Agen-
cy that keeps changing its rules? 
Because the virus is changing and the 
guidance is changing accordingly. The 
virus has mutated and gained strength 
because tens of millions of Americans 
have refused to wear masks or get vac-
cinated. 
Deliberate distortion and outraged 
speeches aren’t going to stop the virus. 
If you want to take off the mask for 
good—and I sure do—if you want your 
kids to go to school without being bur-
dened by a mask—and I certainly do— 
we need to tell the truth. Listen to the 
experts. Get the vaccine. Getting this 
virus behind us for good is the only 
way we can reopen America’s economy. 
In the longer term, the way to re-
main the world’s preeminent economy 
is to invest in the fundamentals of 
strong, sustainable growth and shared 
prosperity. 
It is good that the Senate is debating 
this plan. I hope that it passes this 
week as soon as possible, as well as our 
budget resolution. But in the mean-
time, we cannot ignore that the Nation 
is still in the throes of a pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a courtroom.

who have been working together for 
months now, along with an additional 
12 colleagues, who together—the 22 of 
us Senators—have worked long and 
hard with each other and with the 
White House to introduce this evening 
the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act. 
We know that this has been a long 
and sometimes difficult process, but we 
are proud this evening to announce 
this legislation, and we look forward, 
very much, to working with our col-
leagues in a collaborative and open 
way over the coming days to work

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5236 
August 1, 2021 
through this historic investment in in-
frastructure in our country and to 
come to agreement in the U.S. Senate 
to move forward with this historic 
piece of legislation. 
Now, I know that many of my col-
leagues will talk about some of the vir-
tues of the legislation and the great 
things that it will do for the States 
that we all are proud to represent, the 
States that all of us Senators represent 
across this country. But what I would 
like to direct my brief remarks to this 
evening are not the details of this leg-
islative text—though they are signifi-
cant, and I think they are very mean-
ingful and will have an impact on the 
daily lives of Americans. What I would 
like to speak about is the very process. 
I know it has been difficult, and I 
know it has been long, and what I am 
proud to say is that is what our fore-
fathers intended when they created a 
system of government that required 
Republicans and Democrats to come 
together in a coequal branch of govern-
ment and work with each other and 
with the administration to find legisla-
tion and solutions that meet the needs 
of our country, individuals, and fami-
lies, companies, communities. It is dif-
ficult; it is time consuming; and it is 
exactly what our country insisted and 
demands of us every single day: to take 
the time to work with each other to 
find common ground, to compromise, 
and to be willing to work with each 
other—to give a little, to get a little— 
in order to achieve what is right and 
what is best for the American people. 
I think the process we are embarking 
on this evening, as we soon will join to-
gether with our colleagues of both po-
litical 
parties, 
representing 
every 
State across the country, is an impor-
tant one, and it sends a message to the 
individuals across this country and, in-
deed, to individuals across this world 
that the U.S. Government can work. It 
is difficult; it is time consuming; it can 
be hard; but this very process of find-
ing bipartisan compromise and work-
ing together to overcome obstacles to 
achieve the objectives that the Amer-
ican people are depending upon us to do 
is the very heart and the very core of 
why each of us serves in this govern-
ment, and I, for one—in addition to 
being tired, I, for one, am incredibly 
proud of this process. It is why I ran for 
office, and I believe it is why we have 
all run for office: to work together to 
overcome differences, to find solutions, 
and to make a difference in the lives of 
the American people. 
As we will see in the coming days, as 
we hear from our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, offering amendments 
and adjustments to this legislation, 
and, ultimately, I believe, passing this 
legislation out of the Senate, with a 
strong bipartisan record, we will con-
tinue to once again demonstrate to our 
country and to the world that we can, 
indeed, do our jobs; that we can legis-
late; that we can work together; and 
that we can put aside our own political 
differences for the greater good of our 
country. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I con-
cur with the comments of my colleague 
from Arizona. She put it well. 
This is a really important bill be-
cause it takes our aging and outdated 
infrastructure in this country and 
modernizes it, and that is good for ev-
erybody. It is good for the truckdriver 
who can leave home, knowing he is 
going to be safer on our roads and 
bridges. It is good for the mom who 
commutes to work and is sick of wait-
ing in rush-hour traffic on the way to 
work and on the way back because she 
would rather spend more time with her 
kids. It is good for the factory worker 
in Ohio who makes things that need to 
be transported. We make tanks in 
Ohio; we make cars in Ohio; we make 
washing machines. They go all over the 
world. Our ports—our land ports and 
our 
seaports—are 
inefficient 
and 
backed up. It is good for our consumers 
who are waiting for products from all 
over the world because our ports are 
backed up. 
Our infrastructure is way behind, and 
we will talk a lot more about that over 
the next couple of days with some very 
specific data as to how we have fallen 
behind, how we are not competitive 
anymore, how China has surpassed us 
in terms of infrastructure. As a percent 
of their economy, they spend about 
four times more than we do. Why? Be-
cause they get it. This helps make the 
economy more efficient, more produc-
tive, and, therefore, it actually returns 
an investment to the American people. 
We are also going to hear about how 
it is not going to increase inflation like 
some of the other spending that is 
being talked about around here, partly 
because it is long-term spending for 
capital assets. It is spending that is 
going to add to the supply side, mean-
ing it is actually going to be counter-
inflationary and create more jobs. We 
hear all about that, but one thing that 
I do want to make sure that we hear 
about tonight is the fact that this 
process of starting from the center out 
has worked. 
People have talked about infrastruc-
ture in this city forever. President 
Trump had a $1.5 trillion infrastructure 
package. Ours is $550 billion, by the 
way. Five percent of his was paid for. 
Ours is paid for. We made a commit-
ment early on that we were going to do 
two things: One, we were going to focus 
on core infrastructure. So, when Presi-
dent Biden introduced a $2.65 trillion 
bill and called it infrastructure, we 
said: Well, there is some good stuff in 
there, but let’s pull out the good stuff, 
the core infrastructure because a lot of 
it had nothing to do with infrastruc-
ture. And, second, we said: You know 
what? We are not going to do it by rais-
ing taxes. We are not going to hurt the 
American 
worker 
more 
and 
make 
America less competitive in this; we 
are going to do just the opposite. 
We kept to those two principles, and 
I am so proud of that; that tonight we 
can say the amendment, the substitute 
amendment, is going to be offered, and 
it is going to keep to that commitment 
of $555 billion—no new taxes, core in-
frastructure only—and it is great for 
the American people. 
I want to thank a few people who got 
us here who are going to be able, over 
the next few days, to tell us in great 
detail of the role they played because 
it was significant on every one of their 
parts. 
First, of course, Senator SINEMA; she 
has been the one who has kept us on 
track, and that has been very impor-
tant, but also to my colleagues who are 
here tonight on the floor, Senator 
SUSAN
COLLINS, Senator LISA
MUR-
KOWSKI, Senator MITT ROMNEY, Senator 
BILL
CASSIDY—my 
Republican 
col-
leagues whom we have worked with 
over the last 4 months—and each has 
made huge contributions to this. 
I want to thank the White House for 
their work with us because they said 
early on: OK. We want to do this, too, 
in a bipartisan way. 
We said: OK. If you are serious, we do 
too. 
And, sure enough, we negotiated. It 
was tough, and we had a lot of dif-
ferences, but we were able to get to 
this point tonight. 
Just as important is the group on the 
other side of the aisle who made this 
work, and I see my colleague Senator 
MANCHIN here. I see Senator WARNER 
here. It looks like he really wants to 
speak. I see Senator SHAHEEN here, who 
is about to speak, and I see Senator 
TESTER wandering around here some-
where. These are the folks on the other 
side of the so-called G–10 who made it 
happen. 
And then a much bigger group. So to 
my colleagues who also helped in the 22 
working groups we had in putting this 
together and did such a great job, RICH-
ARD
BURR, LINDSEY
GRAHAM, MIKE 
ROUNDS, THOM TILLIS, JERRY MORAN, 
CHRIS
COONS, MAGGIE
HASSAN, JOHN 
HICKENLOOPER, MARK
KELLY, ANGUS 
KING, JACKY ROSEN—11 Democrats and 
11 Republicans. 
And then, to my friends who took us 
over the top the other night on the 
first vote we had on this, I appreciate 
them because they were not involved 
as much on the details, but they know 
this is the right thing for the country, 
and many of them did help to get us 
where we are: KEVIN
CRAMER, MIKE 
CRAPO, MITCH MCCONNELL, ROY BLUNT, 
CHUCK
GRASSLEY, JOHN
HOEVEN, JIM 
RISCH. 
Folks, we wouldn’t be here without 
every one of them, and we thank all of 
the folks who have put so much time 
and effort into this. 
And, mostly, we got to thank our 
staffs because none of us would be here 
standing tonight, doing this, if we 
didn’t have staff who had been working 
their hearts out, staying here until 12

midnight, ensuring that every single 
thing in this bill has been looked over 
carefully to make sure that we got it 
right. 
And we are getting it right tonight 
for the American people, for our econ-
omy, and for the future of our great 
country. 
I yield to my colleague from Vir-
ginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
f 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I also 
want to, first of all, thank all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Senator SINEMA and Senator PORTMAN 
have taken the lead. I want to thank 
them both—and Senator PORTMAN for 
taking at least 40 seconds of my time 
to enumerate all of our colleagues who 
were part of this effort. 
I also want to thank the staff and ac-
knowledge, as he did, the incredibly 
important role the White House played. 
At some point in this process, the 
White 
House 
realized 
that 
they 
couldn’t just support this initiative, 
but they actually had to own it, and 
they were intimately involved in all of 
the details, and it is something that I 
know they will share with all my 
Democratic colleagues. 
I also want to thank the majority 
leader. He has given us the time we 
need to get here, to get a 3,000—close to 
a 3,000-page bill to this floor, this com-
prehensive. I know it has taken a little 
more time than, maybe, all of us 
thought, but the fact is we have been 
talking about this for 30 years under 
Democrats, Republicans—both polit-
ical parties at various times over the 
last 
30 
years—because 
Senator 
PORTMAN is right. Other nations are 
now investing at a level much greater 
than ours. So this record of a $550 bil-
lion investment in hard infrastructure 
over 5 years has never been done be-
fore. 
Senator MANCHIN often pointed out, 
as we were sometimes feuding and 
fighting over some of the details, that 
no pothole ever decided it was only 
going to hit a Democrat or a Repub-
lican. It hit everybody’s cars. 
We all know we have got thousands 
of bridges that need to be repaired. We 
all know that, post-COVID, high-speed 
broadband is not a ‘‘nice to have’’; it is 
a necessity. We all know too many 
Americans go without access to clean 
drinking water. 
This legislation will be debated and, I 
hope, passed in a strong bipartisan 
way. We will show our country, and we 
will show the world that no country 
around the world can keep up with us 
when we make these kind of invest-
ments. 
I thank my colleagues. 
With that, I yield to my great friend, 
the Senator from Maine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
H.R. 3684 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me 
begin my remarks this evening by ex-
pressing my appreciation to Senators 
PORTMAN and SINEMA for their extraor-
dinary leadership of our group, our bi-
partisan group, of 10 Senators, who 
have labored so hard to bring before 
the Senate the bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act. 
This legislation represents the most 
significant investment in our infra-
structure since the construction of the 
Interstate 
Highway 
System. 
Think 
about that. For generations, for dec-
ades, we have talked about the need to 
rebuild our roads and our bridges, our 
airports, our seaports, our waterways, 
our water treatment systems, and, 
today, to expand high-speed internet 
access to Americans throughout our 
country no matter where they live— 
whether they are in the northern re-
gions of Maine or an inner city neigh-
borhood—and that is exactly what this 
legislation would do. 
I want to just quickly give an exam-
ple from my own State of Maine. 
Maine has 315 bridges and nearly 1,500 
miles of roads that are rated as being 
in poor condition. Now the State of 
Maine will have the funding that will 
enable it to make major investments in 
the repair and replacement of this crit-
ical infrastructure. I am particularly 
pleased that the legislation includes 
$65 
billion 
to 
expand 
access 
to 
broadband. 
And I want to thank my colleague 
Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN, who worked 
so closely with me. We were partners in 
this endeavor, and this is going to 
make such a difference to students who 
are doing online courses, to seniors 
who want access to telemedicine, to in-
dividuals who are able to work from 
home, but none of that is possible with-
out access to high-speed internet serv-
ices. 
I am very pleased to be part of this 
group, and I am also delighted to dem-
onstrate to the American people that 
we can work across the aisle in a bipar-
tisan way to achieve real results that 
matter to the people of this country. 
I yield to the Senator from New 
Hampshire. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
f 
H.R. 3684 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am 
very proud to be here with the rest of 
my colleagues to present this bill that 
will make the biggest investment in in-
frastructure, as Senator COLLINS said 
so well, since the Interstate Highway 
System back in the 1950s. 
This is really an extraordinary work 
product that results from the leader-
ship of Senators SINEMA and PORTMAN 
and from the cooperation of everybody 
on this floor. There were an equal num-
ber of Democrats and Republicans—a 
number who are not here tonight who 
have worked on this bill—the work of 
committee chairs and ranking mem-
bers in the Senate who have done so 
much to put together underlying bills 
that we used in moving this forward 
and, of course, all of the staff from our 
personal offices, from the Appropria-
tions Committee, from all of the com-
mittees that worked on this bill. 
As has been said, this is the biggest 
investment in infrastructure with $550 
million—billion in new spending over 
the next 5 years. It builds on annual 
appropriations. It is an investment in 
roads and bridges, in water and waste-
water, and transit, the electric grid. 
We have got to do this because right 
now we are investing less than our 
competitors—less than China, less than 
India, less than Europe; less than we 
were spending in the United States in 
the 1960s. And if we are going to stay 
competitive, if we are going to provide 
opportunities for the people in this 
country, we have got to make these in-
vestments. 
As my partner in broadband said, if 
kids are going to have an equal oppor-
tunity for the future, then they need to 
have access to high-speed internet. 
More important, I think, is the point 
that all of my colleagues so far have 
made, and that is that this bill shows 
that Republicans and Democrats can 
work together to address the needs of 
this country; that our government is 
not broken. We can make it work if ev-
erybody works together. 
So I know we have a lot of work 
ahead of us to get this bill through the 
floor of the Senate and then through 
the House, and get the help out to the 
American people. But I know that in 
this Chamber we are committed to get-
ting that done and to making sure that 
we make these investments to move 
the country forward. 
So thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield to my colleague from Alaska, 
Senator MURKOWSKI. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The Senator from Alaska. 
f 
H.R. 3684 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it 
is indeed a pleasure to be on the floor, 
even though it is a little bit late on a 
Sunday evening, but to be here with 
colleagues that we have spent probably 
more time with one another than we 
have with our families, our spouses, 
our roommates, and what have you. 
But we have been working to build a 
product not only that we are proud to 
stand behind but a product that I be-
lieve the American public will be proud 
of the work that we have put into 
this—work not just of this group but, 
again, the broader group of 22. 
And also we recognize the very solid 
work that comes from our committees. 
We recognize all that was built at the 
committee level to help kick-start in 
so many different—in so many dif-
ferent—areas, but also to build the 
base of much of this infrastructure bill 
that we have in front of us today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5238 
August 1, 2021 
My friend and colleague from West 
Virginia, Senator MANCHIN, the chair-
man of the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee—when we started 
to sit down and focus on what we were 
going to do with infrastructure, the ne-
cessity for a power piece was impor-
tant. It was critical to what we were 
building. And so the committee went 
to work, put together, I think, a good 
product that moved out of the com-
mittee on a bipartisan basis, and that 
served as really the base for the title 
that is part of this measure, building 
on the energy act that we moved out of 
this body last year. 
So the work that has gone into it has 
been a collaborative process through-
out the way—very much an iterative 
process, as I might add, as well. 
But I think we recognize that the 
good, solid work that has been put into 
this to date is just really the beginning 
of bringing in more of the efforts and 
input from our colleagues from this 
body from around the country. 
You know, when you think about in-
frastructure, infrastructure connects 
us. Infrastructure brings us together. 
And so whether you are from a rural 
State, like mine, or from an urban 
State, like the occupant of the Chair, 
when we are able to move safely and ef-
ficiently, when we are able to commu-
nicate affordably and quickly and effi-
ciently, when we are able to ensure 
that our systems are all working to-
gether, this is what makes us the 
strong, competitive Nation that we 
are. 
So there is extraordinary policy in 
this product, but the process that has 
gotten us here this evening is one that, 
while hard and arduous, as the Senator 
from Arizona has noted, this is what we 
come here to do. We have come here to 
do the hard work, to do the necessary 
work. And tonight we are at that place 
where we can begin to take up the in-
frastructure product that we have been 
working on for months now and what 
the country is waiting for deserves. 
With that, I turn to my friend and 
colleague from West Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
f 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleagues. This has been 
the most enjoyable venture for the last 
6 to 8 weeks. 
So many people have given up on the 
Senate. They have given up on Con-
gress. They have given up on our abil-
ity to be able to do the big things. 
This is big. This is a big deal. And I 
don’t care who is looking at it any way 
they can, it has been said that nothing 
like this has been done in 30 years. It 
hasn’t. We have all talked about it. We 
all knew it. 
Senator WARNER said that, basically, 
potholes and bridges don’t have names. 
They don’t have Republican and Demo-
crat identification. It will hurt us all, 
and it has. 
It is something that every adminis-
tration for the past four to five admin-
istrations knew had to be done, and 
they didn’t because this is hard. It is 
not easy. 
They call us a deliberative body. This 
is true to what deliberation is about: to 
come to an agreement. And it takes an 
awful lot of time, a lot of patience, and 
a lot of effort. We did that. 
And when you think about it, having 
Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER and 
the leader of the Republican Party, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, vote for this piece 
of legislation, that says a lot about it; 
that it is needed. The American people 
are speaking loud and clear. The polls 
are overwhelming, whether it is Demo-
crat, 
Republican, 
Independent—they 
could care less. They want their infra-
structure repaired. 
Let’s rebuild America. We talk about 
it a lot. And when you think about 
this, this is the largest long-term jobs 
program that we have done—that we 
have ever done—for an awful long time. 
They talk about, basically, that the 
economy is soaring now, and they fig-
ure it will taper off and maybe even go 
down. This will prevent that from hap-
pening. These are great jobs. In every 
city, in every part of the county, in 
every State in America, great jobs are 
going to be available for people who 
want good-paying, high-skill jobs with 
benefits. 
This is the bill that will do it for 
them, and this will keep us going from 
5 to 10 years, not just 1 year. It is not 
just a ‘‘one blip’’ on the radar screen 
and we are done. This is for 5 to 10 
years, and we can continue to build on 
it. 
There are only a few things that 
bring us together as Americans, that 
bring us together as Congress, that we 
all gather around. One is the military. 
I have never seen a military piece of 
legislation or NDAA that we all didn’t 
rally around and pass, whether Demo-
crat or Republican. We knew it had to 
be done for the sake of our country. 
And infrastructure is the second. I 
have never seen anything so popular as 
infrastructure. 
People say: Oh, JOE, we need it done. 
And these are people that might be 
hardcore left or hardcore right. They 
could care less. They want their infra-
structure. They want their roads. They 
want their children safe on the buses. 
They want to be able to travel and 
communicate. 
They want internet service, if you 
live in Maine or if you live in rural 
Alaska or you live in rural West Vir-
ginia or New Hampshire or Virginia or 
Louisiana or Utah and also in Ohio. 
Wherever you may be, they want it. 
They want to be able to communicate 
and compete for the jobs of the 21st 
century. 
This is largest investment in clean 
drinking water and wastewater infra-
structure in American history—the 
largest. It is the largest dedicated 
bridge investment since the construc-
tion of the interstate highway system. 
It is the largest investment in clean 
energy transmission and infrastructure 
in the history of our country. It is the 
largest Federal investment in pas-
senger rail since the creation of Am-
trak. Think about that. Think of what 
I just said. It is the largest we have 
ever done. This is something. 
Now, I have always said that the best 
politics is good government. We do 
something good, and we can all take 
credit for it. I have seen people take 
credit for things they voted against 
when it was so good. This is one they 
can. They can say it is going to be 
great, go home, you will enjoy it. 
I can tell you also what the delibera-
tive body that we are and the greatest 
deliberative body in the world. By de-
liberation, it brings us together. We 
know each other. We know each other’s 
families. We care about each other. We 
don’t look at each as Democrat or Re-
publican. These are my friends, my in-
dividual friends, who I think basically 
would have my back at any time of the 
day and I would have theirs. 
This is what brings us—this is what 
people want. They want to see us work. 
And I want to thank—I will thank— 
Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER. He 
has been adamant about let’s pass this 
bill. Hurry up. Now, he has pushed us a 
little bit faster sometimes, but it is de-
liberation. We got through it. But he 
wanted the bill to happen. 
And I think, really—I think deep 
down—that MITCH
MCCONNELL
wants 
the bill. He has voted for it. He wants 
it too. 
So when you have both leaders push-
ing for it on both sides of the aisle, this 
is something that is going to get across 
the line, and I really believe very 
strongly in it. 
It includes the energy infrastructure 
act that passed the ENR, with Senator 
MURKOWSKI, then as the majority, as 
the chairman of Energy and Natural 
Resources. We worked on it together— 
a great piece of legislation. 
We are talking about energy that is 
going to be making and keeping Amer-
ica energy independent, but doing it 
cleaner than at any time in the world, 
anyplace in the world. We are going to 
be the leader for the world. You can’t 
eliminate your way to a clean environ-
ment, but you can innovate your way. 
That is what this bill has. 
It has the commitment to research 
and development that will define basi-
cally the way that we can clean up the 
climate, which we are all responsible 
for. 
So I am very proud to be part of this 
and proud of all of you, my colleagues, 
that I have worked with and I think 
the world of. 
This is something we should be proud 
of. This is a give-and-take proposition. 
Nobody got what they wanted; every-
body got what we needed. And that is 
the most important thing. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Now, I yield to my good friend from 
Louisiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5239 
August 1, 2021 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I join 
tonight in the celebration of a signifi-
cant next step in the passage of a $550 
billion, 
over 
5-year 
infrastructure 
package, with roads and bridges, high-
ways, sewer systems, broadband, flood 
mitigation, and coastal resiliency. 
If our responsibility as Senators is to 
listen to the American people, this bill 
is a product of hearing their voices. It 
is a bipartisan package, which does not 
increase taxes but does meet the needs 
that we have heard of. 
Now, first, let me join others. Sen-
ators PORTMAN and SINEMA, they just 
did a fantastic job of leading this ef-
fort. Our colleagues, both those here 
who are speaking but those who are the 
chairs and ranking members of other 
committees have really guided us tre-
mendously and produced a great work. 
I would also like to acknowledge our 
House colleagues: BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
JOSH GOTTHEIMER, the Problem Solvers 
Caucus, who on their side of the Cham-
ber have also seen fit to already en-
dorse our effort. And when they did, it 
was certainly a strong wind of encour-
agement for us. 
But most of all, I thank the Amer-
ican people. The Constitution gives 
Congress the responsibility for infra-
structure. Our duty gives us the re-
sponsibility to listen. If you listen to 
the American people right now, they 
are concerned about jobs, the economy, 
safety, and quality of life. 
With this bill, we give voice to their 
concerns. For example, as regards safe-
ty, there is $110 billion for better high-
ways, bridges, and roads. Along the 
way, by the way, you create quite a 
number of jobs. 
My State—every State—has been af-
fected by flooding. There is $3.5 billion 
for flood mitigation; $500 million to 
make storm drains bigger, so that if 
there is a tremendous rain event, sys-
tems are better able to hand this. 
There is money for sewer systems, 
money for broadband. Many places in 
my State do not have high-speed inter-
net. This addresses it in my State and 
every other. 
Quality of life. There are people in 
my State who, on a Sunday morning, 
you could drive in 15 minutes to where 
they are going to work, and on a work-
day, it takes them an hour and a half. 
That is 3 hours a day that they are 
away from their family, 3 hours a day 
that they are not doing something pro-
ductive, 3 hours a day of their life 
which is wasted—times the number of 
days they work in a year. This will im-
prove their quality of life. 
And, by the way, did I mention that 
it will create a lot of jobs along the 
way? 
So whether it is to benefit the econ-
omy, to create better paying jobs, to 
make people safer, to improve the 
quality of life, I feel as if we have done 
it. 
Will Rogers said that elected officials 
are nothing but the hired help. I agree 
with that. We were sent here to do a 
job. This legislation shows that Con-
gress can still work, can still do its job 
for the American people. 
With that, I yield to my colleague 
from Utah. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
f 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President it is an 
honor to be here. They say that mak-
ing law is like making sausage. But I 
have seen sausage made, and it is a 
prettier process, and it is a lot easier. 
But this has been a lot more rewarding. 
I have enjoyed the time we have had 
together. 
My good friend from West Virginia 
talked about how much money we are 
spending here, how big this is. But let 
me note something, underscore some-
thing: This is paid for. This is not 
going to raise taxes on people. This is, 
instead, taking some money that was 
already appropriated, not used for 
COVID relief. We are going to bring 
that back and use it to help build infra-
structure. 
This is a bill which is paid for, and it 
gives the American people something 
that they desperately need, and that is 
an upgrade in our infrastructure. 
Now, of course, you know it was sev-
eral months ago that this group came 
together. We call ourselves affection-
ately the G–10. Senator PORTMAN and 
Senator SINEMA have shown enormous 
patience and persistence and resolve 
getting this across the finish line. I 
want to thank also particularly Sen-
ator CAPITO for laying out the founda-
tion for what we proposed at the very 
beginning, which we built upon and has 
led to the final piece of legislation. 
As has been said, neither side got ev-
erything we wanted. There are a bunch 
of things in this bill I don’t like, I 
would take out. There are things in 
this bill I know my Democratic friends 
don’t like and would take out. But the 
nature of getting work done in Wash-
ington is to be able to come up with 
something that has enough good for 
both that we actually get it done. And 
the American people have been waiting 
one President after another after an-
other, saying let’s improve our infra-
structure, and it just doesn’t get done. 
This time, we have. 
Now, I know that Republicans had a 
choice here. We could let the Demo-
crats just do something on their own. 
With reconciliation, they could have 
spent trillions of dollars without any of 
our help. But the President and the 
leaders of the Democratic Party here 
and our friends said: No, let’s work to-
gether and see if we can do something 
collectively. 
Now, I know Members of both parties 
have mischaracterized our efforts as 
somehow linked to paving the way to 
the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion wish list. If 
you don’t think our Democratic friends 
are going to push for that monstrosity 
with or without this bill, then I have a 
bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. They 
are going to push for that anyway. This 
is a separate piece of legislation. I love 
this one. I hate that one. These are two 
very different things, and there is 
going to be an effort, obviously, to stop 
that bill from going forward. 
This is not perfect. It is paid for. 
I want to note as well that if the 
Democrats would have written the bill 
entirely on their own, Utah would 
probably have ended up on the short 
end of the stick. But because of our in-
volvement in this effort, some of our 
rural States like mine have been able 
to have a seat at the table, and that 
means limiting the spending on bad 
policy that only benefits the rich 
coastal cities in the East and the far 
West. So I am proud of this bill because 
it benefits Americans across the coun-
try. 
For decades, elected officials have 
talked about addressing our Nation’s 
infrastructure. This infrastructure bill 
turns that talk into reality without 
raising taxes on hard-working Ameri-
cans or adding to our debt. 
I am proud of my colleagues. It has 
been fun working with them. It was 
challenging from time to time, I am 
sure, to have to listen to me, they 
would tell you, but I am proud of what 
we did together, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Now, I would respectfully request 
that we yield just a minute more to 
Senator PORTMAN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague 
from Utah for his wise words. Yes, it is 
true that there was a $2.65 trillion 
package proposed by President Biden 
for infrastructure, and we are at $550 
billion. So it is bipartisan. Both sides 
made concessions. But it is very dif-
ferent than what we would have seen, 
and again, it is an alternative with no 
taxes. 
I do want to say that there was an-
other effort underway before we got 
started. Actually, SHELLEY MOORE CAP-
ITO was part of our efforts early on and 
then decided to try to work with the 
White House to come up with a pro-
posal. They were not successful in the 
end of bridging the gap between where 
the White House was and where they 
were, and the bipartisan approach that 
we used here ended up being more suc-
cessful, but we are building on the 
foundation that they created. So you 
will see Senator CAPITO managing this 
bill for our side. I appreciate her sup-
port the other day on our first vote, 
and I appreciate the hard work they 
put in to help us to be able to come to 
this point today. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, I 
thank my colleagues for their fine 
speeches, and I very much appreciate 
them.

ators has finished writing the text of

the infrastructure bill, and in a mo-
ment, I will take the procedural steps 
to make their legislative language the 
base of the bill here on the floor. 
I want to congratulate the Members 
of the bipartisan group for their ef-
forts. We haven’t done a large bipar-
tisan bill of this nature in a long time. 
I want to especially thank the staffs, 
who burned the midnight oil many a 
night, for their diligence, their hard 
work, their intelligence, and their 
skill. 
Thank you, staff, listening and a few 
in the room here tonight. 
These days, it isn’t easy to do major 
bills in the Senate, especially bipar-
tisan ones, so I have tried to prod the 
negotiators along when they have 
needed it and given them the space 
when they have asked for it. In the 
end, the bipartisan group of Senators 
has produced a bill that will dedicate 
substantial resources to repair, main-
tain, and upgrade our Nation’s physical 
infrastructure. It has been decades— 
decades—since Congress passed such a 
significant 
stand-alone 
investment, 
and I salute the hard work that was 
done here by everybody. 
In order for our workers, our busi-
nesses, our economy to succeed in the 
21st century, we cannot have infra-
structure that is stuck in the last cen-
tury. The bipartisan infrastructure bill 
is designed to bring our infrastructure 
up to date for a new century, and that 
is a significant achievement. 
Now, for the future, for the informa-
tion of Senators, here is how we plan to 
move forward. I will offer the text of 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill as a 
substitute amendment, as I promised, 
making it the base of the bill. 
Then the Senate will work to con-
sider additional amendments to the bi-
partisan framework. Given how bipar-
tisan the bill is and how much work 
has already been put in to get the de-
tails right, I believe the Senate can 
quickly process relevant amendments 
and pass this bill in a matter of days. 
Then I will move the Senate along 
the second track of our infrastructure 
effort and take up the budget resolu-
tion. 
A bipartisan infrastructure bill is 
definitely necessary, but to many of us, 
it is not sufficient. That is why soon 
after this bill passes the Senate, Demo-
crats will press forward with a budget 
resolution to allow the Senate to make 
further historic, vitally important in-
vestments in American jobs, American 
families, and efforts to reverse climate 
change. 
Look, I have set out two very ambi-
tious goals for the Senate this summer, 
and we are now on the way to achiev-
ing both. As I said, both tracks, this 
one and the other, are very much need-
ed by the American people, and we 
must accomplish both. 
Now, after many days of waiting and 
a lot of hard work and a lot of com-
promise, I ask that the clerk report the 
pending business.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3684) to authorize funds for 
Federal-aid highways, highway safety pro-
grams, and transit programs, and for other 
purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2137 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.) 
Mr. SCHUMER. I call up the Sinema- 
Portman substitute amendment No. 
2137. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from New York [Mr. SCHU-
MER], for Ms. SINEMA and others, proposes 
an amendment numbered 2137. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask to dispense 
with the further reading of the amend-
ment so we may get forward to other 
amendments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
now resume morning business, with all 
previous provisions in order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the majority leader and all of 
my colleagues. I want to mention two 
other things briefly. 
No. 1, Senator TESTER, who has been 
intimately involved in this effort, 
could not be here with us to tonight, 
but he was with us all day and has been 
up with us for weeks and weeks. 
I do think it is really important—the 
base bill that we will be negotiating 
will be the EPW bill. That committee 
is chaired by TOM CARPER from Dela-
ware. He has a lifetime record, from 
the House to his time as Governor, to 
his time in the Senate, of always work-
ing in a bipartisan fashion. He has 
spent literally decades on infrastruc-
ture. He will be carrying the ball for 
the majority on this. We support him, 
and we commend him, and we wouldn’t 
be here if he hadn’t put together the 
kind of base bill that we were then able 
to build upon. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent to speak for the duration 
of my remarks, not to be limited by 10 
minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is an 
honor to serve in this body. It is an 
honor to serve with the men and 
women from whom we have just heard. 
The Senators from whom we have 
just heard are some of my favorite peo-
ple in the Senate. For that matter, 
they are some of my favorite people. I 
like them, Democrats and Republicans 
alike. They are hard-working. They 
have been working really hard. They 
have gotten very little sleep in the last 
few days. 
Notwithstanding my great respect 
for them personally and professionally, 
I rise today because I have got real 
concerns with this bill, a lot of them. 
Those concerns, unfortunately, can’t 
be overcome by the respect I have for 
the individuals involved or my grati-
tude to them for their willingness to 
work hard for months on end and 
through the night on many, many 
nights in the recent past. These indi-
viduals are hard-working, and they 
genuinely want to do good. 
I have a different perspective on this 
bill. I recognize that I am the only one 
with that perspective on the floor right 
now, but I assure you, Mr. President, I 
am not alone. I am not alone among 
Senators, and I am sure not alone 
among those I represent and those rep-
resented by the 100 of us in this body. 
There are a number of Americans who 
see that all is not well with the way we 
spend money, the people’s money, 
within the Federal Government, and it 
is to them that I would like to direct 
my remarks tonight. 
Let’s talk for a minute, first of all, 
about infrastructure. One of the things 
that I think makes this an appealing 
piece of legislation is the fact that it 
deals with something that most Ameri-
cans intuitively understand we need. 
Infrastructure is something that is 
somewhat uniquely positioned for gov-
ernment. It doesn’t always have to be 
through government, but it can be, and 
it often is because it is a public good. 
It is a public good that is supposed to 
be accessible to all, not excludable, and 
it is difficult to have that without 
some sort of a master plan. 
Infrastructure is also something that 
can make the difference between some-
one having to spend hours of their life 
each day stuck in gridlock traffic and 
being able to spend time at home with 
their family. 
Infrastructure benefits us in count-
less ways. The fact that infrastructure 
is a good thing and that we need it is 
a different question from whether we 
can afford the infrastructure plan in 
this particular case. It is also a sepa-
rate question from whether Federal in-
frastructure is what we need, at least 
to this degree.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5241 
August 1, 2021 
Remember that we are a government 
of powers that James Madison de-
scribed as few and defined. That is in 
Federalist No. 45. By comparison, he 
described the powers reserved to the 
States as numerous and indefinite. 
The powers of Congress and, by ex-
tension, the powers of the Federal Gov-
ernment are those, for the most part, 
outlined in article I, section 8 of the 
Constitution. There have been a few 
other powers added since then. Most of 
them, most of the power that we rely 
on in enacting legislation—the over-
whelming majority of the powers we 
rely on can be found in article I, sec-
tion 8. 
Article I, section 8 really does come 
up with a pretty limited list of powers. 
We are in charge of national defense, 
trademarks, copyrights and patents, 
postal roads and post offices, and im-
migration code to determine questions 
on immigration and naturalization, 
bankruptcy laws, declaring war, grant-
ing letters of marque and reprisal. 
That is one of my favorite powers be-
cause, you know, it is a power that we 
have to issue essentially a hall pass in 
the name of the United States that en-
titles the bearer to engage in state- 
sponsored acts of piracy on the high 
seas in the name of the United States 
with utter impunity, and that is really, 
really cool that we have that power. 
We don’t exercise it very often; at least 
we haven’t in the last century or so. 
We also have the power to regulate 
trade or commerce between the States 
with foreign nations and with Indian 
Tribes. We have the power to collect 
taxes and to spend that money. And I 
believe the best reading of that clause, 
clause 1 of article I, section 8, is that 
we have the power to spend money on 
those powers that are enumerated in 
article I, Section 8 or elsewhere. 
We don’t have the power—in article I, 
section 8, you won’t find a generalized 
power that just says: Go out and spend 
things that you think would be good 
for the American people. 
Some people make the argument that 
that very power can, in fact, be found 
in clause 1 of article I, section 8. They 
will refer to what they sometimes 
characterize as the general welfare 
clause. 
Now, the term ‘‘general welfare’’ is a 
term of art that appears exactly twice 
in the Constitution. The first time it 
appears is in the preamble. Remember 
that the preamble is a nice, lovely 
statement. It is not an operative provi-
sion. It doesn’t contain any authority. 
The second time, as I mentioned, is 
in article I, section 8, clause 1. James 
Madison believed—and I believe—that 
most of the Founding Fathers were 
with him in this belief. As I said a mo-
ment ago, it was intended to grant 
Congress the power to spend money on 
those things that they were put in 
charge of. It doesn’t mean just go out 
and spend money on anything that we 
deem appropriate. There is also no 
power in there—in article I, section 8, 
or elsewhere in the Constitution—that 
gives us the power to create jobs. 
Now, I understand that that is an ap-
pealing thing. People like being able to 
have jobs. They like an economy that 
provides jobs. So when a politician can 
promise job creation, that sounds like 
an appealing feature. That, in and of 
itself, can’t be our objective; and that, 
in and of itself, doesn’t actually work. 
I will touch on this a little more a lit-
tle bit later. 
But we have to remember that the 
Federal Government has no ability to 
generate wealth. It lacks that capac-
ity; that, regardless of what you think 
of the Federal Government and the ex-
tent of Federal power, the Federal Gov-
ernment can’t create wealth. It can 
only transfer it. It can collect taxes. It 
can do new things, and those things 
can be good. They can even have posi-
tive impacts on the economy. 
We lack the power to generate 
wealth. We, therefore, lack the power 
to create jobs. Because, remember, 
when we are taking money, we are tak-
ing it from someone else—taxpayers, 
typically. Or in the case of borrowed 
money—and we will get more to that 
later—talking about future generations 
of Americans who will pay for this. 
So we are not creating jobs. We are 
just taking money from one group of 
people to do a specific job. And, yes, 
some people might be employed in 
those projects. That doesn’t mean we 
are actually creating jobs. 
Nor can we forget the fact that when 
we do something, we can always take 
credit for the things that we do. Those 
things don’t necessarily take account 
of the things in the economy that 
would have happened but for our inter-
vention. We can’t take into account 
what hospital wings might have been 
built but for the fact that we took a 
whole bunch of money and spent it on 
a Federal priority. 
So let’s get back to the distinction 
between 
State 
power 
and 
Federal 
power; specifically as it relates to in-
frastructure. I can see a number of in-
stances in which some infrastructure 
projects might well be appropriate for 
Federal spending. 
It was President Dwight D. Eisen-
hower who proposed the creation of the 
Interstate Highway System back in the 
1950s. One of the arguments that he 
came up with—in fact, as I recall, is 
the principal argument that President 
Eisenhower relied on in creating the 
Interstate Highway System—was that, 
for purposes of national defense, we 
needed to have a way that we could 
move U.S. military personnel from one 
part of the country to another. 
He did some research on it and dis-
covered that many parts of the country 
would be inaccessible from other parts 
of the country; and if they needed to 
get troops from one area to another, 
that could create a real national secu-
rity hazard. 
I suppose he might also have relied 
on the power to regulate interstate 
commerce. To my knowledge, he was 
relying principally on the defense as-
pect of having an Interstate Highway 
System. 
So, on that basis, he proposed that 
we create the Interstate Highway Sys-
tem; and he proposed, and Congress 
passed with his signature, legislation 
creating a gasoline tax to pay for the 
creation of the Interstate Highway 
System. It was more or less the deal 
that he cut with the American people. 
He said: Look, we, Congress, and the 
Federal Government, as a whole, will 
fund this. We will then fund the build-
ing of the Interstate Highway System. 
Once the Interstate Highway System is 
built, we will hand it over to the re-
spective States, understanding that 
each State would have a portion of the 
Interstate Highway System running 
through it. We will hand over to each 
State the portions of the Interstate 
Highway System running through that 
State. Those States would then be re-
sponsible for maintaining it and keep-
ing it functioning and so forth. 
In the seven or so decades since that 
plan was conceived and hatched, we 
have now built the Interstate Highway 
System. It is complete. The Federal 
gasoline tax has been adjusted on sev-
eral occasions since then. It has been a 
few decades since it has been adjusted, 
but it currently stands at 18.4 cents per 
gallon. That is the portion of what 
every American pays when they go to 
the gas pump. Regardless of what other 
additional State tax they might pay on 
that gasoline, it is 18.4 cents out of 
every gallon that goes into the Federal 
Highway Trust Fund, and that is still 
there, notwithstanding the fact that 
the Interstate Highway System is still 
in existence. 
Now, one might ask why. Well, deci-
sions have been made over time sug-
gesting it might be appropriate still for 
us to maintain the Interstate Highway 
System using Federal gasoline tax dol-
lars. It is a decent argument; one that 
I can accept, notwithstanding the fact 
that it wasn’t part of the original plan. 
Why then, with Federal infrastruc-
ture money, do we always dip into the 
Federal Highway Trust Fund and have 
to supplement it with general fund rev-
enues? 
Why is the 18.4 cents per gallon—a 
tax, remember, that is the vestigial re-
mains of the tax originally put in place 
to build it with the understanding we 
would hand it over and the States 
would maintain it. 
The question becomes an even more 
interesting one when you realize that 
it doesn’t cost 18.4 cents per gallon to 
maintain the Interstate Highway Sys-
tem. In fact, it doesn’t take anything 
close to that. Estimates vary some, 
but, according to some estimates, you 
can do that for about 5 cents per gal-
lon. And yet we collect 18.4 cents per 
gallon. And yet that is never enough 
because, on transportation funding, we 
routinely spend a lot more than that 
and we have to dip into other sources 
of revenue, including what we collect 
in income tax and so forth. 
Why is that? 
Well, it is because of the mission 
creep. Instead of just focusing on Fed-
eral infrastructure, we have focused on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5242 
August 1, 2021 
a lot of things that are not Federal in-
frastructure; things that, while lovely, 
useful, perhaps necessary, aren’t nec-
essarily Federal in nature; things like 
bike paths, hiking trails, beautifi-
cation projects that go alongside of a 
transportation corridor, and, in some 
cases, mass transit systems; in some 
cases, surface streets that may or may 
not even be connected to the Interstate 
Highway System; and that, in many 
cases, start and end entirely within one 
State that are not part of the inter-
state network at all. 
So why, then, do we do that? 
I mean, we do that to a really large 
degree. As the sponsors of this bill, this 
bill that I received for the first time 
just moments ago—I was sitting on the 
Senate floor waiting to begin my re-
marks, 2,702 pages long. I see it sitting 
near the desk clerk right now. It is a 
rather impressive specimen. It is a 
large piece of legislation. It is one that 
I look forward to reading. It is one that 
I realize will not exactly read like a 
fast-paced novel. 
Reading legislation like this and 
being able to digest it takes a fair 
amount of expertise. It takes a lot of 
patience, and it takes countless in-
stances of cross-referencing to multiple 
existing provisions in Federal law to 
understand. There is 2,702 pages. They 
have worked hard on it. It has taken 
them 4 months to come up with it, and 
even though I have got grave concerns 
with the legislation and can’t fathom a 
circumstance in which I will vote for 
it—although that said, that remains to 
be seen, depending on what we are able 
to change about it. You see, any piece 
of legislation can potentially turn into 
something that any Member ought to 
be able to vote for it, depending on how 
the amendment process goes. 
In its current form, I couldn’t pos-
sibly vote for it because it simply 
spends too much money. It spends 
money that we do not have, and it 
spends an enormous amount of money 
at a time when the American people 
are feeling the pinch of inflation—in-
flation brought about predictably and 
foreseeably by a government that 
spends way too much money. 
In effect, it is just printing more 
money. I mean, technically, I know 
there is an additional step involved in 
that. 
Technically, 
it 
is 
borrowed 
money. The Treasury issues instru-
ments of debt, and in those instru-
ments of debt, we borrow money from 
our creditors. There are lots of inves-
tors 
from 
all 
over 
America 
and 
throughout the world who buy those 
instruments of debt from us. 
But because the U.S. dollar is the 
world’s reserve currency, and because 
many regard U.S. Treasuries as sort of 
the least bad investment of its kind, 
people will buy them; and this stuff 
functions almost—when we decide to 
issue additional debt—functions almost 
as if hitting a button, just printing 
more money. 
When you print more money and you 
have a relatively finite basket of goods 
and services that an economy can 
produce in a particular year, the same 
basket of goods—when that same bas-
ket of goods can be targeted by more 
money, inflation is going to hit and 
people are going to have to pay more 
for the same things that they always 
need to buy. 
So, look, this doesn’t necessarily 
hurt wealthy Americans. In fact, some 
of the wealthiest and most well-con-
nected Americans will get rich off of 
legislation like this. Keep in mind, this 
legislation spends $1.2 trillion. The $550 
billion number is the number that just 
refers to the new spending. So that 
means there was already roughly $700 
billion that they were anticipating 
would be spent based on past practice. 
That doesn’t necessarily mean that we 
have to start all of this from the as-
sumption that we will continue spend-
ing at that pace, but it certainly 
shouldn’t obscure the fact that this is 
an enormous amount of money—$1.2 
trillion—that we will be spending here. 
This is at a time when Americans are 
feeling the pinch of inflation precisely 
because of the pace at which we have 
been spending money. I mean, look, we 
were already spending way too much 
money even before COVID hit. In the 
last few years, we have typically been 
shelling out about $4 trillion a year 
through the Federal Government. And, 
tragically, even at the top of the eco-
nomic cycle, where we were right when 
COVID hit, we were still borrowing $1 
out of every $4 we were spending. We 
were taking in about $3 trillion and 
spending 
about 
$4 
trillion 
before 
COVID hit. This, at a time where we 
are at the top of the economic cycle, 
fantastic economic growth, record low 
unemployment, 
things 
were 
going 
great and we were still borrowing $1 
out of every $4 we were spending. 
COVID hits. Last year, instead of 
spending $4 trillion, which is already 
too much, we spent $6.6 trillion, $6.7 
trillion. So we spent $3.6 trillion more 
than we brought in. 
One of my colleagues recently point-
ed out to me that about 37 percent of 
all U.S. dollars that have ever come 
into existence have come into exist-
ence in the last 18 months. That, by 
itself, should help people understand 
why their dollars are going less far 
than they have ever gone before. Be-
cause when you just add to the money 
supply, when government spends that 
much money that it does not have, 
that does not exist, it lessens the buy-
ing power of every dollar of every 
American. 
There, 
again, 
are 
some 
people, 
wealthy, 
well-connected 
individuals 
and corporations in this country who 
will get very rich off of a $1.2 trillion 
spending bill. They just will. We know 
it. They have got sophisticated ana-
lysts, lawyers, lobbyists, and compli-
ance specialists who I can assure you 
right now, at this very moment, are 
combing through that bill to figure out 
how they can get wealthy off of it. 
Those who don’t get wealthy off of it 
but who are already wealthy them-
selves probably won’t notice the pinch 
as much. Sure, they might notice that 
they are paying more for everything 
from gasoline to groceries, to air travel 
and everything in between, but it prob-
ably won’t impact their lifestyle, at 
least not for the top 1 percent. 
But then you have got pretty much 
everyone else—pretty much everyone 
else in America who is not wealthy, 
not well connected, who won’t make 
money off of this, and isn’t wealthy 
enough; any person who is not wealthy 
enough to be able to cushion the blow 
of inflation to where it doesn’t have to 
impact their lifestyle, pretty much ev-
eryone else, and that means the over-
whelming majority of Americans. 
I mean, I am talking about probably 
90, 95 percent of the men and women in 
America really will get hurt by this. 
Most people in America, in one way or 
another, are living paycheck to pay-
check, and if their paycheck remains 
the same during a time period in which 
each dollar goes less far, that really 
hurts them. And if they are living close 
to the edge on what they can afford 
with that paycheck and we further di-
minish the buying power of the dollar 
through our reckless spending in order 
to bring praise and adulation from the 
media and from each other, shame on 
us. That is reverse Robin Hood. That is 
stealing from the poor to give to the 
rich. Why then would we do that? Why 
would we do it right now? 
By the way, because of this same 
spending spree, this orgiastic convul-
sion of Federal spending of money that 
we do not have, we have labor short-
ages, and we have material shortages. 
The cost of labor and the cost of mate-
rials that will go into these projects 
are costing more than they ever have 
before. So why is this the time to ag-
gressively push something when we 
know full well that it will cost more 
right now because of other things we 
have done and that will, in turn, make 
other things that the American people 
need to buy more expensive? 
Shame on us for making poor and 
middle-class Americans poorer so that 
we can bring praise and adulation to 
ourselves and more money to a small 
handful of wealthy, well-connected in-
terests in America. 
It begs the additional question: There 
has got to be an additional reason why 
you would want to make all this spend-
ing Federal. I mean, keep in mind, it is 
not just that most powers of govern-
ment are and are supposed to be lodged 
in States and localities. That is also 
true. But it is also true that most in-
frastructure falls within the domain of 
States and localities. Most roads that 
people use from one day to the next are 
State roads or local roads. They are 
not Federal. 
So why does all of this need to be 
Federal? Why couldn’t some of this, 
why couldn’t most of it, why couldn’t 
perhaps nearly all of either the new 
spending or all of the spending incor-
porated within this $1.2 trillion pack-
age, why shouldn’t that be something

that States and localities could play a 
part in? 
Now, one might reason, perhaps there 
is some additional efficiency that could 
come from this centralization of this 
plan by making the plan Federal—by 
making the money Federal. Maybe we 
can make it more efficient. We can 
standardize it. That argument might 
be compelling if it were true, but it 
isn’t. It is quite to the contrary. 
When you add Federal money to any 
infrastructure project, the minute you 
add Federal money to it, you attach a 
whole host of Federal laws and Federal 
regulations that the State or local gov-
ernment carrying out the work then 
has to comply with, such that if the 
project were not Federal, if there were 
not Federal dollars in place, they 
wouldn’t have to comply with the same 
Byzantine labyrinth. They wouldn’t 
have to negotiate this Byzantine lab-
yrinth of Federal regulations and man-
dates. 
This affects everything from the cost 
of labor to the cost of materials, to the 
length of time needed to complete the 
project, the paperwork involved. And 
at the end of the day, it results in less 
of that money going into steel and con-
crete being placed in the ground and a 
whole lot more of it going to lawyers, 
accountants, 
compliance 
specialists, 
and delays, frankly. 
In fact, this varies a little bit from 
State to State, but in many States, in-
cluding my own, you often add 30 per-
cent, sometimes it is closer to 40 per-
cent, to the cost of a project the 
minute you add Federal dollars. Even 
just a few Federal dollars will add 
these requirements, and those require-
ments require a lot of additional 
money. 
It is not the case that we make this 
more efficient, that we make each dol-
lar stretch farther by consolidating it 
and distributing it back to the States, 
which 
is 
how 
these 
infrastructure 
projects often work. 
It is also intuitively something that 
doesn’t add up. Why would we take 
money, bring it to Washington, run it 
through our filter, knowing some of 
that money can slosh around, some of 
it gets lost administratively, and send 
it back? That wouldn’t make things 
more efficient. Separate and apart 
from the fact that we make infrastruc-
ture more expensive when we do that, 
it doesn’t make sense intuitively. 
All of this also arises in the context 
in which, due to the recent spending 
spree that we have been on in Wash-
ington, we are at a scary place with re-
gard to our debt-to-GDP ratio. It is 
about 2 years ago when the Congres-
sional Budget Office issued a report ex-
pressing some concerns about the fact 
that we were, at the time, about 79 per-
cent—our debt-to-GDP ratio was about 
79 percent. 
It is concerning because it had been 
mounting for some time. It was con-
tinuing to mount at the time. It was 
continuing, tragically, to mount, even 
though we were at the top of the eco-
nomic cycle with good job growth, good 
economic growth, low unemployment, 
and so forth, and yet we were still add-
ing to the debt at a rate of about $1 
trillion per year. But they concluded, 
yes, 79 percent debt to GDP, this is bad. 
They also forecasted at the time that 
we might cross the dreaded 100 percent 
debt-to-GDP ratio within about a dec-
ade. I believe the prediction at the 
time was that we would cross that 
threshold sometime in maybe 2029. 
One of the reasons people worry 
about that is that there has been a lot 
of research done on this. A couple of 
economists from Stanford University 
wrote a book. The name of the book 
was, ‘‘This Time Is Different.’’ It is one 
of many academic publications that ex-
plored the relationship of the debt-to- 
GDP ratio and economic growth. 
They conclude that once you cross 
that threshold, 100 percent debt to 
GDP, economic growth tends to stall, 
and it becomes much more difficult to 
manage the Federal debt at that point, 
the national debt that you are dealing 
with. And they have done this using 
models from all over the world, going 
back hundreds of years. And they have 
concluded that this is a threshold at 
which economies tend to stall out. 
The name of the book was inspired by 
the fact that they said, basically, every 
country, when it approaches this sort 
of thing, tends to—the government 
tends to tell the people of that coun-
try: Don’t worry. We are different. This 
time, it will be different, just as Amer-
icans and the Federal Government tend 
to tell people this day: Don’t worry, 
this time it will be different. 
They say it is not. This is real stuff. 
So it was with some concern a couple 
of years ago, when the Congressional 
Budget Office issued this report saying: 
Yes, we are at 79 percent now, and by 
the end of the 2020s, if we don’t turn 
things around, we should be hitting 100 
percent debt-to-GDP ratio. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, the CBO 
issued another report. That report con-
cluded that by the end of this year, by 
the end of 2021, our debt-to-GDP ratio 
will be at a staggering 106 percent. So 
at that moment when we really should 
be very concerned—because, look, re-
gardless how comfortable someone has 
been with deficit spending in the past, 
there are people who brushed off con-
cerns by making an argument that, 
look, as long as the economy on the 
whole and the big picture is growing 
faster than the debt, we should be able 
to keep a lid on it; we should be able to 
prevent it from spinning out of control. 
Now, there is some real appeal to 
that argument, but that appeal starts 
to dwindle. In fact, it disappears en-
tirely once your debt is growing much, 
much faster than your economy. And it 
gets even more concerning once you 
past that 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio 
because at that point, many econo-
mists predict that you will experience 
not just a cyclical, not just a periodic 
or episodic short-term downturn eco-
nomic growth, but you will experience 
a secular downturn, one that is likely 
to last much longer than that. 
So at a moment like that, I respect-
fully tend to think we should be asking 
ourselves the question about money 
that we are already spending. Should 
we even be spending money that we 
have already been planning to spend? 
The $700 billion that we had planned to 
spend over the next few years, perhaps 
that could be pared back. But, instead, 
we are saying: No, we are going to do 
all of that, not cut back on any of it, 
and then we are going to add $550 bil-
lion to it. 
To me, that is kind of scary, espe-
cially when you take into account how 
all of these things are interconnected. 
The fact that we have been spending 
too much, way too much, the fact that 
we have inflated the dollar as a result, 
that as a result of inflation, Americans 
are finding it harder to fill up their gas 
tank, they are finding it harder to pay 
their grocery bills, to pay for their 
rent, their mortgage, they are finding 
it harder to do just about everything, 
so why would we want to step on the 
accelerator at that moment, which also 
happens to be the precise same moment 
when the cost of all the things that we 
will need to undertake this ambitious 
infrastructure spending package, in-
cluding 
materials, 
steel, 
concrete, 
labor, everything else that we will need 
in connection with that, when all of 
those things are more expensive and 
made more expensive still by the fact 
that we are making them all Federal 
because, when you use Federal dollars 
for an infrastructure project, it typi-
cally cost a lot more. 
In a State like mine, it is often 30 
percent, sometimes more than that. It 
costs that much more the minute you 
add Federal dollars. For that reason, in 
my State and in many others, State 
transportation officials—very bright— 
my friend Carlos Braceras, who has 
been the long-time head of the Utah 
Department of Transportation, he and 
his team in the State of Utah and with 
the help of Utah’s Governor and its leg-
islature, they have figured ways to 
make sure that when Federal funding 
comes their way, it doesn’t bleed into 
everything. 
There are a number of projects that 
they try to keep insulated from Fed-
eral spending, from Federal dollars, 
specifically for the reason that it is 
likely to cost more and sometimes 
take longer if you involve Federal dol-
lars in it. So why would we want to 
continue exactly as we have been going 
and then add to it an additional $550 
billion? 
Now, on the inflation side of this ar-
gument, some of my colleagues will 
argue—in fact, some of them argued to-
night—that 
this 
is 
noninflationary 
spending and that it is going to be 
lengthened over—it will be spent over a 
lengthy period of time and we, there-
fore, shouldn’t worry about the impact 
it might have on inflation. 
I have a couple of responses to that. 
First of all, the fact that we will be

spending it over a period of several 
years doesn’t mean it won’t have an 
impact on inflation. The fact is, when 
we spend more Federal money, espe-
cially Federal money that we don’t 
have, that is the definition of infla-
tionary. Maybe it is not as inflationary 
as it would have been had this bill 
spent two or three times that amount 
and had it been mandated that it all be 
spent immediately, but that doesn’t 
make it noninflationary. 
Many of them also argued that it is 
OK because it is all paid for, the new 
money is all paid for. Well, it is one of 
the things that we will be exploring 
over the next few days, and I hope we 
will have even longer than that to 
wade through it. On this point, I would 
add simply that my colleagues—again, 
all Senators for whom I have tremen-
dous respect and affection. 
Every one of these Senators who has 
worked on this has worked hard on it. 
They are passionate about it. I like 
them. I respect them, even though I 
disagree with them on this. But many 
of them pointed out that it is paid for. 
Yet, when you look at the pay-fors, I 
wonder whether it actually is. 
Now, some of the arguments that 
they make in saying that it is all paid 
for rely on things like recapturing 
COVID funds already appropriated but 
not yet spent. 
I suppose that is a good thing to do. 
If we have got COVID money that we 
have appropriated but that hasn’t been 
spent, I suppose we have got to recap-
ture that and direct it somewhere else. 
But I am not sure that that necessarily 
means that there is no cost or con-
sequence to choosing to spend it here. 
I mean, if we appropriated more 
money for COVID than we should have, 
than we needed to, shouldn’t we also 
consider—I don’t know—giving it back 
to the American people or paying down 
the debt so that we don’t add to the 
debt as quickly? I think that ought to 
be on the table as well. So that is part 
of it, is the argument that we are tak-
ing a good chunk of it from COVID 
money that has previously been appro-
priated but not spent. 
They also rely on a number of other 
arguments suggesting that it is paid 
for and not through tax increases or 
additional borrowing. Some of those 
arguments are, I suppose, technically 
defensible but not necessarily within 
the spirit of what they are saying. For 
example, there is a large sum of 
money, many billions of dollars—the 
last time I checked, their proposal was 
at about $13 billion—to reinstate the 
fees attached to the production and 
distribution of certain chemicals. Like 
I said, the last time I checked, the pro-
posal was at about $13 billion falling 
into that category. It might be more or 
less because, again, we just now re-
ceived the 2,702-page bill that now sits 
at the clerk’s desk in front of us. 
So let’s assume that it is $13 billion 
from the collection of that. Well, it 
really is—at least, in my investigation 
of that, they are imposing taxes on the 
production and distribution of certain 
chemicals, many of which are used in 
the production of basically everything, 
basically all consumer products. 
So it is listed as a fee, not a tax. 
Sometimes, the distinction between a 
fee and a tax can be relatively minor 
and relatively insignificant, but, re-
gardless, it is money that ends up 
being paid for by poor and middle-class 
Americans in the form of higher prices 
passed down to the consumer on every-
thing that American consumers buy. 
The biggest difference between this 
and a tax is that with a tax, there is 
some record somewhere of what the 
taxpayer is paying. But with a fee that 
is going into basically every consumer 
product in the case of many of these 
chemicals, it is effectively an invisible 
or sort of hidden tax, so it is actually 
less desirable than a tax increase, in 
that respect. 
Like I say, there are two purposes of 
our tax system. The more obvious pur-
pose is just to fund the government. 
But the other purpose is to commu-
nicate the cost of government to the 
voter so that the voter knows what 
they are getting and what they are 
paying for. 
Things like these hidden fees that 
will increase the cost of all manufac-
tured items, maybe just a little but 
with no pricetag attached to it, it 
seems kind of unfair to me. 
Last I checked also, there were $56 
billion counted among the pay-fors, $56 
billion that they were counting on as 
something that would be collected by 
the Federal Government as tax revenue 
as a result of increased economic activ-
ity stemming specifically from the 
money that we are spending in this leg-
islation. 
Now, I don’t think we score infra-
structure bills that way. To my knowl-
edge, we haven’t done that in the past. 
To my knowledge, the Congressional 
Budget Office, whose job it is to score 
these things and which I hope will give 
us a score here—I don’t think it typi-
cally scores infrastructure bills that 
way. 
So, yeah, we are going to spend $1.2 
trillion on this bill, but that $1.2 tril-
lion being plied into the economy is 
going to do other things, and that, in 
turn, will generate revenue and come 
back to us this way. You sometimes 
hear of things like that being done 
from advocates of tax reform, and 
sometimes dynamic scoring has been 
done in tax reform. I don’t think it is 
typically 
done 
with 
infrastructure 
projects. 
I also think it is wildly speculative 
to assume that $56 billion will come 
from this and that that $56 billion 
wouldn’t come from the Federal Gov-
ernment if we weren’t doing this. It 
goes back to the common fallacy with 
government. You can see the tangible 
things that government does, but see-
ing those tangible things that govern-
ment does often obscures and makes 
impossible to know what would have 
been done in the absence of govern-
ment intervention, what hospital wing 
won’t be built as a result of people pay-
ing higher prices for everything they 
buy and higher prices on their tax bill 
and through inflation, generally. 
You don’t always see all of the con-
sequences built into that, but you can 
see the tangible benefits, which is ex-
actly why this is such a tantalizing, 
tempting 
thing 
for 
politicians—be-
cause, look, when politicians vote to 
spend more money, not theirs but ev-
erybody else’s, the way things work in 
our society today, in our mainstream 
media today, you will get praised for 
that. You will pretty much always get 
praised for voting to spend more of the 
American people’s money as long as 
you can identify good people who will 
benefit from it. And you can almost al-
ways do that, and I am absolutely cer-
tain that there are a lot of good, de-
serving, hard-working Americans who 
will be able to point to things in this 
bill that they will benefit from. I won’t 
take that away from the bill’s spon-
sors, not for a moment. 
There are absolutely good things 
that will happen to good people—good, 
deserving people—if we pass this legis-
lation. It is very tempting to do that 
because we will get praised if we do it. 
And once we create the expectation 
that we are going to do it and then we 
don’t do it, we will get criticized. Pre-
dictably, those who vote for this will 
get praised in the media. Those who 
vote against it will get attacked as 
thoughtless and insensitive and not 
caring about those people who will ben-
efit from it. 
But what about the Americans who 
will be harmed by it? It is one of the 
tragic consequences of spending large 
volumes of money through a system of 
government. We have the luxury in 
government of collecting money by 
force. Usually, that force doesn’t have 
to be brought to bear directly; it is the 
implicit threat of the potential for use 
of force that allows governments to 
collect money. In fact, it is what dif-
ferentiates governments from busi-
nesses or individuals or any other en-
terprise that might want to collect 
money in some way. Governments can 
use the implicit threat of force and 
carry out the threat of force when nec-
essary in order to carry out our man-
date. 
So we always have to remember that, 
even though we will get praised for 
spending other people’s money because 
there are good people who will benefit 
from it, there are other people who are 
harmed. It is a tragic consequence of 
concentrated benefits and dispersed 
burdens 
attached 
to 
basically 
all 
spending legislation. I mean, it is real-
ly difficult. I don’t know quite how to 
unravel it other than to say it is one of 
the many reasons why we should ad-
here to the constitutional norms estab-
lished in 1787, as modified with each of 
the 27 amendments that we have adopt-
ed, in figuring out what is and what is 
not a Federal priority. 
There are a lot of things that are 
good ideas. We don’t have to utilize

force or the implicit use of force or the 
potential use of force for all of them, 
but that is what we do when we push 
things through government. And when 
we push them through the Federal 
Government, we add other problems to 
them. 
Back to the drafters of this legisla-
tion. It took them 4 months to get to 
this. And, again, I commend them for 
doing that. I don’t fault them for the 
fact that it took them that long. I 
praise them for their willingness to 
dedicate their time and that much of 
their lives to something they care 
about. I happen to disagree with where 
they are going with it, but I respect 
them, nonetheless, greatly for it. 
But think about this. This group that 
has been working together has been 
very, very intimately involved in the 
negotiation of the details of it, but it 
took them 4 months to get there. There 
are, what, 10 or so of them. But there 
are 100 of us, and we have got 435 coun-
terparts in the House of Representa-
tives. 
Article I, section 7 tells us that you 
can’t create legislation at the Federal 
level without going through Congress. 
You can’t pass Federal legislation 
without it passing the House and pass-
ing the Senate and being presented to 
the President for signature or for veto. 
So it does still have to get through this 
body. 
What I would suggest is that if it 
took these 10 or so of our colleagues 4 
months to get here, it is not reasonable 
to expect that the rest of us can be 
brought to where they are in a matter 
of days. That is one of the reasons why 
we have committee processes. And I am 
not of the view that there is no piece of 
legislation that ought to ever be passed 
without it having gone through a full 
committee process and regular order. 
There are lots of times when that 
might not be necessary or appropriate 
or there might be other extenuating 
circumstances. 
I wonder, here, why that didn’t hap-
pen, but, regardless, the bill is here 
now. It is on the Senate floor now. We 
ought to consider it. But I would sug-
gest this. If it took them 4 months to 
get comfortable with it, is it at all rea-
sonable to expect that we should get 
through it and over the threshold of 
passing it, placing burdens on the 
American people that will last not just 
for years but for decades, in a matter 
of days? Would it be unreasonable to 
suggest that we ought to have at least 
a few weeks to debate it and discuss it; 
that we ought to have at least half the 
time that they have had to prepare 
this? It took them 4 months. Shouldn’t 
we at least have a month or 2? 
We are approaching a time when 
Members of Congress typically spend 
more time in their home States. Is it 
at all unreasonable to suggest that 
maybe we ought to take that time to 
vet this with the people we represent in 
our respective States? I would love 
nothing more than to take that 2,702- 
page bill around the State of Utah with 
me in my visits to the State in the 
month of August. I would love to get 
their input on it. I would love for them 
to be able to have access to that docu-
ment so we can have this debate and 
this discussion. 
And, yeah, sure, I have got grave con-
cerns with it. In its present form, I 
can’t vote for it. That doesn’t mean 
that we can’t make it better. That 
doesn’t mean that we can’t all benefit 
a lot from having those who have elect-
ed us have the chance to review this. 
Now, I don’t expect that all 31⁄2 mil-
lion Utahans will read that 2,702-page 
bill. It does not read like a fast-paced 
novel. But they still ought to have 
time to learn about what is in it, to at 
least read analysis performed by others 
and presented to them in a digestible 
form so that we can get their input on 
how it might affect their lives for good 
or for ill. 
Some of the other arguments that we 
have heard also need to be addressed. 
We have been told tonight that many 
of our peer nations are spending more 
money on infrastructure than we are. I 
am not sure that is true in every case. 
In fact, there aren’t a lot of countries 
on Earth that can afford to spend any-
where near the amount of money that 
we spend on anything, infrastructure 
or otherwise. So if that is what they 
are suggesting, I am not sure the argu-
ment pans out in a dollar-for-dollar or 
dollar-for-dollar equivalent analysis. If 
they are talking about as a percentage 
of GDP, maybe that is a good point. 
If we are talking about China, I am 
not sure that we want to measure what 
we do and evaluate the sufficiency of 
what we do on infrastructure the same 
way China would. China, remember, 
has a very highly centralized form of 
government and a very highly central-
ized economy, which China, being a 
communist 
dictatorship, 
focuses 
around the government, around their 
national government. That is a critical 
difference. I don’t think the Chinese 
model is one that we want to emulate 
here. 
The argument was also made that 
many in Europe are spending more. 
Again, perhaps they mean as a percent-
age of GDP. I am not sure. I would note 
here that many countries in Europe 
have the luxury of doing a lot of things 
that we don’t, in part, because of the 
burden that we carry for them on 
issues of national defense. Even with 
that, I doubt very highly that any 
country in Europe spends more dollars 
or more dollar equivalence of whatever 
currency they use than the United 
States, so I am not sure what is meant 
by that argument. 
We have to remember that anytime a 
politician, anytime an elected official, 
says ‘‘you need me,’’ the opposite is 
true. He or she, who when saying ‘‘you 
need me,’’ is actually saying ‘‘I need 
you.’’ 
People aren’t here to serve the gov-
ernment. The government exists for 
the purpose of serving the people. We 
have to be very, very wary of anything 
that sounds like we are telling the peo-
ple ‘‘you need us, you need us to take 
money from you and to take money 
from your yet unborn children or from 
your children who are alive today but 
not yet old enough to vote and spend it 
in a manner that we see deem fit.’’ 
For that additional reason, we should 
be extra cautious. As much as I love 
and respect the colleagues who put to-
gether this 2,702-page bill, I want to go 
through it to make sure that it spends 
money in the way that my constituents 
would like, which is all the more rea-
son why—if it took them 4 months, 
shouldn’t we really at least take a few 
weeks with it and not just a few days? 
Now, $1.2 trillion is what this bill 
wants to spend. It is easy to get caught 
up in the words ‘‘million,’’ ‘‘billion,’’ 
‘‘trillion.’’ In fact, I have heard most of 
our colleagues—most of us at one point 
or another have made the mistake, 
hopefully not in public as much, but at 
least in our private conversations as 
we discuss large numbers—large num-
bers necessarily involved in funding a 
government as large as ours is. Some-
times we will find ourselves saying 
‘‘million’’ when we mean ‘‘billion,’’ or 
‘‘billion’’ when we mean ‘‘trillion,’’ or 
some other combination of syntactic 
errors. There is a big difference be-
tween them, a thousandfold difference 
at every level. 
Remember that a number of people 
have pointed out recently in order to 
encapsulate the point, a million sec-
onds lasts just 111⁄2 days; a billion sec-
onds lasts 31.69 years; a trillion seconds 
lasts 31,688.74 years. There is an enor-
mous difference here—an enormous dif-
ference that we ought to take into ac-
count. 
So I don’t mean to suggest that any 
of this is easy. It is not easy at all. But 
we ought to get concerned anytime 
someone proposes that we spend this 
much money all at once, we have got 
to do our due diligence. 
Now, people like to talk about roads, 
bridges, wastewater projects. They like 
to talk about potholes. Those things 
are all really important. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague 
just yield for a minute for a brief inter-
ruption? I will close the Senate but 
then allow him to speak for as long as 
he should choose. 
Mr. LEE. I would be happy to. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I see he doesn’t have 
many notes, but it is all sui generis, I 
know that. 
Mr. LEE. I am not sure I would use 
the word ‘‘sui generis’’ there, but go 
ahead. 
Mr. SCHUMER. No comment.

f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
my friend and colleague, the majority 
leader, for allowing me to finish my re-
marks this evening. 
When we look at legislation like this, 
I hope we can pay attention to a few 
details—a few details—that focus on 
more than just our roads, bridges, 
wastewater projects, and other infra-
structure matters. 
Are they important? I hope we will 
ask 
specifically: 
Are 
they 
appro-
priately Federal? Could they be just as 
easily handled as some other level of 
government? 
I hope that we will also ask: If they 
are appropriate for the Federal Govern-
ment, are we spending appropriately 
there? And, are we doing it at the right 
time? Are we placing the dollars that 
we are going to spend on the right 
things? 
I also hope that we will pay careful 
attention to something that my friend 
and my distinguished colleague from 
Arizona, Senator SINEMA, said. She 
pointed out throughout this process it 
was difficult and time consuming. I 
liked how she put it. She said: It is sup-
posed to be that way. 
Our Founding Fathers set up a sys-
tem in which it would necessarily be 
difficult and time consuming to get 
there. She is absolutely right. It is not 
supposed to be easy to pass legislation 
because 
legislation, 
especially 
like 
this, impacts a lot of people—a lot of 
people who are not here. There are only 
100 of us who have the privilege of serv-
ing in this body, and we have 330 mil-
lion people in this country who will be 
affected by it, and they will be affected 
by it for a long time to come. 
That is why it is supposed to be dif-
ficult and time consuming. There, 
again, I point back to the fact that it 
took 
this 
committee—this 
com-
mittee—or this group; they are not a 
committee—this group of 10 or so Sen-
ators 4 painstaking months to come up 
with this. And it is to their credit that 
they were able to get it done even in 
that amount of time. 
Again, I don’t agree with the conclu-
sion that they reached. I can’t vote for 
this bill as it is written. But that real-
ly is remarkable that they were able to 
do it in that period of time. 
The fact that they, as a small group, 
were able to do that in 4 months means 
that this body has no business passing 
this legislation in a matter of just a 
few days. Quite arguably, we should 
need more time than that, not less, to 
digest it. But for the sake of discus-
sion, and for the sake of respecting 
what appears to be a widely held view 
in this body that we ought to act on 
this, we at least need a few weeks. We 
shouldn’t be doing this in just a few 
days. 
I also hope that we will keep in mind 
that every one of us in this body holds 
an election certificate, whether we par-
ticipated in the drafting of this bill or 
not, and every one of us should have 
the opportunity to offer up amend-
ments and to vote on those amend-
ments to make improvements to the 
bill, whether we support it in its cur-
rent form or not, whether we intend to 
vote for the finished package or not, 
every one of us deserves an opportunity 
to offer as many amendments as we 
may choose. And if we want them 
voted on, they should be voted on. We 
shouldn’t be afraid of it. 
Often it is through the amendment 
process that we discover the nooks and 
crannies, we discover the unintended 
consequences that we allow the public 
to have visibility and to what has been 
a process that most people don’t have 
access to. So I hope that we will do 
that and that we will be respectful to 
each other’s views in doing that. 
Bad things happen when legislation— 
especially legislation spending as much 
money as this one does or anything 
close to it—is drafted in secret. 
Look, there is no problem—I don’t 
have a problem at all with the fact 
they have been meeting. Members have 
every prerogative to decide what they 
want to propose behind closed doors. 
That is how the deliberative process 
works that results in legislation. But 
once it is here, as it is now, we need to 
take into account the fact that this 
hasn’t been through committee; this 
hasn’t been aired in its current form. 
We have got to give it the adequate air-
ing that it needs and that the Amer-
ican people deserve. 
So I hope, I expect that in the com-
ing days, what I hope will actually be 
the coming weeks, we will have the op-
portunity to review this in full, to 
share it with our constituents, to have 
it analyzed, to have it scored by the 
Congressional Budget Office—we have 
no business spending this kind of 
money without a CBO score—and then 
Members need to be able to offer 
amendments on it. 
We live in difficult times, and we live 
in times where there is a lot of rancor 
and there is a lot of disagreement. I am 
glad that there has been a good feeling 
here tonight with people who have been 
able to come together. 
Sometimes we can’t pass legislation 
simply because it is bipartisan. We 
can’t be expected to pass it just be-
cause some Democrats and some Re-
publicans happen to agree with it. That 
is actually not all that uncommon. 
From watching the news, sometimes 
you get the impression we can’t stand 
each other and that there is such deep- 
rooted animus across party lines, that 
we can’t talk to each other, we don’t 
like each other, and that the problem 
with Congress is that we can’t get any-
thing done because there is partisan 
gridlock that stops everything. 
Well, I would offer a different per-
spective to that. The fact that legisla-
tion like this occurs, bipartisanship; 
the fact that you don’t get to be al-
most $30 trillion in debt without a 
whole lot of bipartisanship. Every sin-
gle time we add an enormous sum to 
our national debt, there is bipartisan-
ship behind it. Just because something 
is bipartisan doesn’t mean that it is 
taking into account the needs of poor 
and middle-class Americans, who in-
creasingly, of late, are being robbed 
blind by those who, for short-term po-
litical gain and praising the media, 
will make things more expensive for 
the poor and middle class, enabling a 
small handful of wealthy and well-con-
nected interests to benefit from it. The 
fact that it is bipartisan shouldn’t ob-
scure the problems with it. I hope we 
will have an opportunity to address 
those problems and that we will give 
this legislation the due consideration 
it deserves. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Subtitle C—National Cyber Resilience 
Assistance Fund 
SEC. 70621. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL 
CYBER 
RESILIENCE 
ASSISTANCE 
FUND. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States now operates in a 
cyber landscape that requires a level of data 
security, 
resilience, 
and 
trustworthiness 
that neither the United States Government 
nor the private sector alone is currently 
equipped to provide; 
(2) the United States must deny benefits to 
adversaries who have long exploited cyber-
space to their advantage, to the disadvan-
tage of the United States, and at little cost 
to themselves; 
(3) this new approach requires securing 
critical networks in collaboration with the 
private sector to promote national resilience 
and increase the security of the cyber eco-
system; 
(4) reducing the vulnerabilities adversaries 
can target denies them opportunities to at-
tack the interests of the United States 
through cyberspace; 
(5) the public and private sectors struggle 
to coordinate cyber defenses, leaving gaps 
that decrease national resilience and create 
systemic risk; 
(6) new technology continues to emerge 
that further compounds these challenges; 
(7) while the Homeland Security Grant 
Program and resourcing for national pre-
paredness under the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency are well-established, 
the United States Government has no equiv-
alent for cybersecurity preparation or pre-
vention; 
(8) the lack of a consistent, resourced fund 
for investing in resilience in key areas inhib-
its the United States Government from con-
veying its understanding of risk into strat-
egy, planning, and action in furtherance of 
core objectives for the security and resil-
ience of critical infrastructure; 
(9) the Federal Government must fun-
damentally shift the way it invests in resil-
ience and shift the focus away from reactive 
disaster 
spending 
towards 
research-sup-
ported and risk-driven proactive investment 
in critical infrastructure cyber resilience; 
(10) Congress has worked diligently to es-
tablish the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, creating a new agency that 
can leverage broad authorities to receive and 
share information, provide technical assist-
ance to operators, and partner with stake-
holders across the executive branch, State 
and local communities, and the private sec-
tor; 
(11) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency requires strengthening in 
its mission to ensure the national resilience 
of critical infrastructure, promote a more se-
cure cyber ecosystem, and serve as the cen-
tral coordinating element to support and in-
tegrate Federal, State, local, and private- 
sector cybersecurity efforts; and 
(12) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency requires further resource 
investment and clear authorities to realize 
its full potential. 
(b) AMENDMENTS.—Subtitle A of title XXII 
of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 
U.S.C. 651 et seq.) is amended— 
(1) in section 2202(c) (6 U.S.C. 652(c))—

obstacles to recovery, including insufficient 
public and private resources to address dis-
aster-related housing and community devel-
opment needs for lower income households 
and distressed communities; 
(2) unmet disaster recovery needs, includ-
ing housing assistance needs, can be espe-
cially widespread among persons with ex-
tremely low, low, and moderate incomes; 
(3) economic, social, and housing hardships 
that affect communities before disasters arc 
exacerbated during crises and can delay and 
complicate long-term recovery. especially 
after catastrophic major disasters; 
(4) States, units of local government, and 
Indian Tribes within the most impacted and 
distressed areas resulting from major disas-
ters benefit from flexibility to design pro-
grams that meet local needs, but face inad-
equate financial, technical, and staffing ca-
pacity to plan and carry out sustained recov-
ery, restoration, and mitigation activities; 
(5) the speed and effectiveness consider-
ations of long-term recovery from cata-
strophic major disasters is improved by pre-
dictable investments that support disaster 
relief, long-term recovery, restoration of 
housing and infrastructure, and economic re-
vitalization, primarily for the benefit of low- 
and moderate-income persons; 
(6) undertaking activities that mitigate 
the effects of future natural disasters and ex-
treme weather and increase the stock of af-
fordable housing, including affordable rental 
housing, as part or long-term recovery can 
significantly reduce future fiscal and social 
costs, especially within high-risk areas, and 
can help to address outstanding housing and 
community development needs by creating 
jobs and providing other economic and social 
benefits within communities that further 
promote recovery and resilience; and 
(7) the general welfare and security of the 
nation and the health and living standards of 
its people require targeted resources to sup-
port State and local governments in carrying 
out their responsibilities in disaster recov-
ery and mitigation through interim and 
long-term housing and community develop-
ment activities that primarily benefit per-
sons of low and moderate income.

structure in the most impacted and dis-
tressed areas resulting from a catastrophic 
major disaster. 
‘‘(B) PUBLIC COMMENT.—In the notice issued

no more than 30 percent of the total esti-
mate or unmet needs. 
‘‘(5) REGULATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall, by 
regulation, establish a formula to allocate 
assistance from the Fund to the most im-
pacted and distressed areas resulting from a 
catastrophic major disaster. 
‘‘(B) FORMULA
REQUIREMENTS.—The for-
mula established under subparagraph (A) 
shall— 
‘‘(i) set forth criteria to determine that a 
major disaster is catastrophic, which criteria 
shall consider the presence of a high con-
centration of damaged housing or businesses 
that individual, State, Tribal, and local re-
sources could not reasonably be expected to 
address without additional Federal assist-
ance, or other nationally encompassing data 
that the Secretary determines are adequate 
to assess relative impact and distress across 
geographic areas. 
‘‘(ii) include a methodology for identifying 
most impacted and distressed areas, which 
shall consider unmet serious needs related to 
housing, economic revitalization, and infra-
structure; 
‘‘(iii) include an allocation calculation 
that considers the unmet serious needs re-
sulting from the catastrophic major disaster 
and an additional amount up to 30 percent 
for activities to reduce risks of loss resulting 
from other natural disasters in the most im-
pacted and distressed area, primarily for the 
benefit of low- and moderate-income persons, 
with particular focus on activities that re-
duce repetitive loss of property and critical 
infrastructure; and 
‘‘(iv) establish objective criteria for peri-
odic review and updates to the formula to re-
flect changes in available science and data. 
‘‘(C) MINIMUM ALLOCATION THRESHOLD.—The 
Secretary shall, by regulation, establish a 
minimum allocation threshold. 
‘‘(D) INTERIM ALLOCATION.—Until such time

under this paragraph, the Secretary shall— 
‘‘(i) allocate assistance from the Fund 
using the formula allocation methodology 
published in accordance with paragraph (4); 
and 
‘‘(ii) include an additional amount for 
mitigation equal to 15 percent of the total 
estimate of unmet need. 
‘‘(6) ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall— 
‘‘(i) except as provided in clause (ii), not 
later than 90 days after the President de-
clares a major disaster, use best available 
data to determine whether the major dis-
aster is catastrophic and qualifies for assist-
ance under the formula in paragraph (4) or 
(5), unless data is insufficient to make this 
determination; and 
‘‘(ii) if the best available data is insuffi-
cient to make the determination required 
under clause (i) within the 90-day period de-
scribed in that clause, the Secretary shall 
determine whether the major disaster quali-
fies when sufficient data becomes available, 
but in no case shall the Secretary make the 
determination later than 120 days after the 
declaration of the major disaster. 
‘‘(B) ANNOUNCEMENT
OF
ALLOCATION.—If 
amounts arc available in the Fund at the 
time the Secretary determines that the 
major disaster is catastrophic and qualifies 
for assistance under the formula in para-
graph (4) or (5), the Secretary shall imme-
diately announce an allocation for a grant 
under this section. 
‘‘(C) ADDITIONAL
AMOUNTS.—If additional 
amounts are appropriated to the Fund after 
amounts are allocated under subparagraph 
(B), the Secretary shall announce an alloca-
tion or additional allocation (if a prior allo-
cation under subparagraph (B) was less than 
the formula calculation) within 15 days of 
any such appropriation. 
‘‘(7) PRELIMINARY FUNDING.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—To speed recovery, the 
Secretary is authorized to allocate and 
award preliminary grants from the Fund be-
fore making a determination under para-
graph (6) if the Secretary projects, based on 
a preliminary assessment of impact and dis-
tress, that a major disaster is catastrophic 
and would likely qualify for funding under 
the formula in paragraph (4) or (5). 
‘‘(B) AMOUNT.— 
‘‘(i) MAXIMUM.—The Secretary may award 
preliminary funding under subparagraph (A) 
in an amount that is not more than 
$5,000.000.

preliminary funding awarded under subpara-
graph (A) based on the size of the prelimi-
nary assessment of impact and distress.

nary funding awarded under subparagraph 
(A) shall be limited to eligible activities 
that—

ability of the grantee to assess unmet recov-
ery needs, plan for the prevention of im-
proper payments, and reduce fraud, waste,

liminary funding for activities described in 
this paragraph, the Secretary may waive re-
quirements of this section in accordance 
with subsection (i). 
‘‘(F) AMENDED AWARD.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—An award for preliminary 
funding under subparagraph (A) may be 
amended to add any subsequent amount 
awarded because of a determination by the 
Secretary that a major disaster is cata-
strophic and qualifies for assistance under 
the formula. 
‘‘(ii) APPLICABILITY.—Notwithstanding sub-
paragraph (D), amounts provided by an 
amendment under clause (i) are subject to 
the requirements under subsections (h)(1) 
and (f)(1) and other requirements on grant

ing awarded under this paragraph, the Sec-
retary shall assign or provide technical as-
sistance to the recipient of the grant.

grants under this section to be used inter-
changeably and without limitation for the 
same activities in the most impacted and 
distressed areas resulting from a declaration 
of another catastrophic major disaster that 
qualifies for assistance under the formula es-
tablished under paragraph (4) or (5) of sub-
section (a); and 
‘‘(2) shall establish requirements to expe-
dite the use of grants under this section for 
the purpose described in paragraph (1).

populations, critical natural resources, and 
property that an analysis of hazards shows

ments assisted in whole or part under this

(e) 
DISADVANTAGED
BUSINESS
ENTER-
PRISES.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(A) while significant progress has occurred 
due to the establishment of the disadvan-
taged business enterprise program, discrimi-
nation and related barriers continue to pose 
significant 
obstacles 
for 
minority- 
and 
women-owned businesses seeking to do busi-
ness in Federally assisted surface transpor-
tation markets across the United States; 
(B) the continuing barriers described in 
subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of 
the disadvantaged business enterprise pro-
gram; 
(C) Congress has received and reviewed tes-
timony and documentation of race and gen-
der discrimination from numerous sources, 
including 
congressional 
hearings 
and 
roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued 
by public and private agencies, news stories, 
reports of discrimination by organizations 
and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits, 
which show that race- and gender-neutral ef-
forts alone are insufficient to address the 
problem; 
(D) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in subparagraph (C) demonstrate 
that discrimination across the United States 
poses a barrier to full and fair participation 
in surface transportation-related businesses 
of women business owners and minority busi-
ness owners and has impacted firm develop-
ment and many aspects of surface transpor-
tation-related business in the public and pri-
vate markets; and 
(E) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in subparagraph (C) provide a strong 
basis that there is a compelling need for the 
continuation of the disadvantaged business 
enterprise program to address race and gen-
der discrimination in surface transportation- 
related business. 
(2) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection: 
(A) SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.—

justed annually by the Secretary for infla-
tion.

TAGED INDIVIDUALS.—The term ‘‘socially and

nomically disadvantaged individuals.

NESS ENTERPRISES.—Each State shall annu-
ally—

percentage of the small business concerns

taged individuals (other than women); and

(7) COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS.—Noth-
ing in this subsection limits the eligibility of 
an individual or entity to receive funds made 
available under this division, division C, and 
section 403 of title 23, United States Code, if 
the entity or person is prevented, in whole or 
in part, from complying with paragraph (3) 
because a Federal court issues a final order 
in which the court finds that a requirement 
or the implementation of paragraph (3) is un-
constitutional. 
(8) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROMPT PAYMENT 
OF DBE SUBCONTRACTORS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) the Secretary should take additional 
steps to ensure that recipients comply with 
section 26.29 of title 49, Code of Federal Reg-
ulations (the disadvantaged business enter-
prises prompt payment rule), or any cor-
responding regulation, in awarding Federally 
funded transportation contracts under laws 
and regulations administered by the Sec-
retary; and

creasing the ability of the Department to 
track and keep records of complaints and to 
make that information publicly available.

State to secure approval, or to implement, a 
highway safety program described in sub-
section (a)(1).

GENERAL.—A highway safety pro-
gram approved by the Secretary shall not in-
clude any requirement that a State shall im-
plement such a program by adopting or en-
forcing any law, rule, or regulation based on 
a guideline promulgated by the Secretary 
under this section requiring any motorcycle 
operator aged 18 years or older, or a motor-

to terminate a capacity contract as soon as 
practicable after determining that sufficient 
transmission capacity of the eligible project 
has been secured by other entities to ensure 
the long-term financial viability of the eligi-
ble project, including through 1 or more 
transfers under subparagraph (B). 
(B) TRANSFER.—On payment to the Sec-
retary by a third party for transmission ca-
pacity to which the Secretary has rights 
under a capacity contract, the Secretary

paragraph (B) or (C) shall be in an amount 
sufficient for the Secretary to recover any 
remaining costs incurred by the Secretary 
with respect to the quantity of transmission 
capacity affected by the transfer under sub-
paragraph (B) or the relinquishment under 
subparagraph (C), as applicable. 
(6) OTHER
FEDERAL
CAPACITY
POSITIONS.— 
The existence of a capacity contract does not 
preclude a Federal entity, including a Fed-
eral power marketing administration, from 
otherwise securing transmission capacity at 
any time from an eligible project, to the ex-
tent that the Federal entity is authorized to 
secure that transmission capacity. 
(7) FORM OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.—Enter-
ing into a capacity contract under sub-

TITLE III—FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS 
Subtitle A—Carbon Capture, Utilization, 
Storage, and Transportation Infrastructure 
SEC. 40301. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the industrial sector is integral to the 
economy of the United States— 
(A) providing millions of jobs and essential 
products; and 
(B) demonstrating global leadership in 
manufacturing and innovation; 
(2) carbon capture and storage technologies 
are necessary for reducing hard-to-abate 
emissions from the industrial sector, which 
emits nearly 25 percent of carbon dioxide 
emissions in the United States; 
(3) carbon removal and storage tech-
nologies, including direct air capture, must 
be deployed at large-scale in the coming dec-
ades to remove carbon dioxide directly from 
the atmosphere; 
(4) large-scale deployment of carbon cap-
ture, removal, utilization, transport, and 
storage— 
(A) is critical for achieving mid-century 
climate goals; and 
(B) will drive regional economic develop-
ment, technological innovation, and high- 
wage employment; 
(5) carbon capture, removal, and utiliza-
tion technologies require a backbone system

TITLE 
I—BROADBAND 
GRANTS 
FOR 
STATES, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUER-
TO RICO, AND TERRITORIES 
SEC. 60101. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Access to affordable, reliable, high- 
speed broadband is essential to full partici-
pation in modern life in the United States.

United States is a barrier to the economic 
competitiveness of the United States and eq-
uitable distribution of essential public serv-
ices, including health care and education. 
(3) The digital divide disproportionately af-
fects communities of color, lower-income 
areas, and rural areas, and the benefits of

TITLE IX—BUILD AMERICA, BUY AMERICA

SEC. 70901. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Build 
America, Buy America Act’’. 
PART I—BUY AMERICA SOURCING 
REQUIREMENTS 
SEC. 70911. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the United States must make signifi-
cant investments to install, upgrade, or re-
place the public works infrastructure of the 
United States; 
(2) with respect to investments in the in-
frastructure of the United States, taxpayers 
expect that their public works infrastructure 
will be produced in the United States by 
American workers; 
(3) United States taxpayer dollars invested 
in public infrastructure should not be used 
to reward companies that have moved their 
operations, investment dollars, and jobs to 
foreign countries or foreign factories, par-
ticularly those that do not share or openly 
flout the commitments of the United States 
to environmental, worker, and workplace 
safety protections; 
(4) in procuring materials for public works 
projects, entities using taxpayer-financed 
Federal assistance should give a common-
sense procurement preference for the mate-
rials and products produced by companies 
and workers in the United States in accord-
ance with the high ideals embodied in the en-
vironmental, worker, workplace safety, and 
other regulatory requirements of the United 
States; 
(5) common construction materials used in 
public works infrastructure projects, includ-
ing steel, iron, manufactured products, non- 
ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based 
products (including polyvinylchloride, com-
posite building materials, and polymers used 
in fiber optic cables), glass (including optic 
glass), lumber, and drywall are not ade-
quately covered by a domestic content pro-
curement preference, thus limiting the im-
pact of taxpayer purchases to enhance sup-
ply chains in the United States; 
(6) the benefits of domestic content pro-
curement preferences extend beyond eco-
nomics; 
(7) by incentivizing domestic manufac-
turing, domestic content procurement pref-
erences reinvest tax dollars in companies 
and processes using the highest labor and en-
vironmental standards in the world; 
(8) strong domestic content procurement 
preference policies act to prevent shifts in 
production to countries that rely on produc-
tion practices that are significantly less en-
ergy efficient and far more polluting than 
those in the United States; 
(9) for over 75 years, Buy America and 
other domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws have been part of the United 
States procurement policy, ensuring that the 
United States can build and rebuild the in-
frastructure of the United States with high- 
quality American-made materials; 
(10) before the date of enactment of this 
Act, a domestic content procurement pref-
erence requirement may not apply, may 
apply only to a narrow scope of products and 
materials, or may be limited by waiver with 
respect to many infrastructure programs, 
which necessitates a review of such pro-
grams, including programs for roads, high-
ways, and bridges, public transportation, 
dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime fa-
cilities, intercity passenger and freight rail-
roads, freight and intermodal facilities, air-
ports, water systems, including drinking 
water and wastewater systems, electrical 
transmission facilities and systems, utili-
ties, broadband infrastructure, and buildings 
and real property;

the United States have moved offshore, the 
strength and readiness of the defense indus-
trial base of the United States has been di-
minished; and 
(15) domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws— 
(A) are fully consistent with the inter-
national obligations of the United States; 
and 
(B) together with the government procure-
ments to which the laws apply, are impor-
tant levers for ensuring that United States 
manufacturers can access the government 
procurement markets of the trading partners

Subtitle C—Make PPE in America 
SEC. 70951. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Make 
PPE in America Act’’. 
SEC. 70952. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed 
the vulnerability of the United States supply 
chains for, and lack of domestic production 
of, personal protective equipment (PPE). 
(2) The United States requires a robust, se-
cure, and wholly domestic PPE supply chain 
to safeguard public health and national secu-
rity. 
(3) Issuing a strategy that provides the 
government’s anticipated needs over the 
next three years will enable suppliers to as-
sess what changes, if any, are needed in their 
manufacturing capacity to meet expected de-
mands. 
(4) In order to foster a domestic PPE sup-
ply chain, United States industry needs a 
strong and consistent demand signal from 
the Federal Government providing the nec-
essary certainty to expand production capac-
ity investment in the United States. 
(5) In order to effectively incentivize in-
vestment in the United States and the re- 
shoring of manufacturing, long-term con-
tracts must be no shorter than three years in 
duration. 
(6) To accomplish this aim, the United 
States should seek to ensure compliance 
with its international obligations, such as 
its commitments under the World Trade Or-
ganization’s Agreement on Government Pro-
curement and its free trade agreements, in-
cluding by invoking any relevant exceptions 
to those agreements, especially those related 
to national security and public health. 
(7) The United States needs a long-term in-
vestment strategy for the domestic produc-
tion of PPE items critical to the United 
States national response to a public health 
crisis, including the COVID–19 pandemic.

SEC. 90003. FINDINGS REGARDING UNUSED UN-
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUNDS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On July 16, 2021, the Congressional 
Budget Office (in this section referred to as 
‘‘CBO’’) reduced its projected cost of the ex-
tension of expanded unemployment com-
pensation as enacted in the American Rescue 
Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 117–2). 
(2) CBO budget projections included man-
datory outlays for the expansion totaling 
$144,000,000,000 in 2021 and $8,000,000,000 in 
2022. That estimated cost is $50,000,000,000 
less in 2021, and $3,000,000,000 less in 2022, 
than anticipated in CBO’s March 2021 cost es-
timate. 
(3) CBO reduced its projections of those 
costs for two major reasons. First, several 
States have announced that they are dis-
continuing one or more of the components of 
expanded unemployment compensation be-
fore the expansion’s authorization ends in 
September 2021. In its original estimate, CBO 
projected that all States would participate 
in the programs until September. Second, 
because of the improving economy, the agen-
cy has lowered its forecast of the unemploy-
ment rate, resulting in fewer projected bene-
ficiaries for the programs, which also re-
duced projected costs. 
(4) It is estimated that there are approxi-
mately $53,000,000,000 in savings from the 
amounts in the Treasury originally esti-
mated to be spent on unemployment insur-
ance funds (under the provisions of subtitle 
A of title II of division A of the CARES Act) 
not used by the States.
