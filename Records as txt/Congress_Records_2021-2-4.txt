Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2021 
No. 21 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the 
order of the House of January 4, 2021, 
the Chair will now recognize Members 
from lists submitted by the majority 
and minority leaders for morning-hour 
debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

MEETING OUR PARIS AGREEMENT 
COMMITMENTS 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, by 
rejoining the Paris Agreement, Presi-
dent Biden has promised the world that 
America will retake its position as a 
global leader in the fight against cli-
mate change and be true to its word to 
meet 
our 
commitments 
to 
reduce 
greenhouse gases. It now falls to us—it 
falls to Congress—to prove the Presi-
dent right. 
Despite all the confused, disingen-
uous, and flatly false rhetoric around 
the Paris Agreement, in reality, it is 
simply a framework for catalyzing, 
measuring, and improving action to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions and 
adapting to climate impacts. 
The agreement, signed by 195 coun-
tries in Paris and not simply for the 
benefit of that city, is made up of com-
mitments from each nation, deter-
mined by that nation, and which they 
are each responsible for meeting. 
President Biden’s commitment, nec-
essary as it was, will not itself reduce 
America’s emissions enough to meet 
our 2015 promise to the world or to 
stem the climate crisis. For that, we 
must act urgently. We must reject the 
bad-faith talking points about a false 
dichotomy 
between 
environmental 
stewardship and economic growth and 
openly embrace the idea that a sustain-
able economy is dependent upon a sus-
tainable environment. 
Far from climate action costing us 
jobs, the truth is that our entire econ-
omy is at stake if we do act on climate. 
By contrast, climate action means 
clean air and better public health. It 
means more miles between fill-ups and 
more money in Americans’ pockets. It 
means reliable, robust harvests and in-
novative and productive ways to make 
money farming sustainably. 
It means passing America’s beautiful 
natural heritage on to future genera-
tions and protecting the places and 
creatures that make our country the 
envy of the world. It means safe, liv-
able coastlines that don’t wash away 
our roads and our homes. And it means 
high-paying 
jobs 
that 
can’t 
be 
outsourced—up to 24 million globally, 
according to the United Nations. 
We have a lot of work to do: building 
out electric vehicle infrastructure and 
a modern electric grid; cleaning up our 
rivers and lakes; deploying clean, re-
newable power generation; and invent-
ing the next leap in battery storage 
technology. 
No one is better suited than Amer-
ican workers. Low-carbon, long-term, 
and resilient economic growth and eco-
logical stability are within our grasp, 
but only if we have the courage to go 
after them. 
This Congress must send legislation 
to the President’s desk meeting this 
challenge and seizing this opportunity. 
Executive action cannot do it alone. 
I am proud to serve as vice chair of 
the House Sustainable Energy and En-
vironment Coalition. This group has 
worked for years to advance common-
sense legislation to create green jobs 
and seize low-carbon opportunities, ex-
actly the type of legislation we will 
need to meet our Paris Agreement 
commitments. 
Mr. Speaker, preliminary data indi-
cates that 2020 will tie 2016 and go down 
in history as the hottest year on 
record. This means that the 7 hottest 
years have now occurred in the 7 last 
years. 
The call for action from those whose 
homes have been destroyed by natural 
disasters and from those suffering 
through 
record 
heat 
waves 
and 
droughts is loud and clear. And we hear 
that same call from our constituents 
who see through the pandering mis-
direction of outdated thinking, under-
stand the imperative to act, and in-
creasingly vote only for those willing 
to take action. 
President Biden corrected an egre-
gious mistake when he moved to reen-
ter the U.S. into the Paris Agreement. 
We must move with him and usher in 
the low-carbon economy of the future 
now.

LOCKDOWNS ARE KILLING US 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we 
are now nearly 1 year into the most 
self-destructive social experiment in 
the recorded history of human civiliza-
tion. 
On this day 1 year ago, we enjoyed 
the greatest economic expansion in our 
lifetimes. The poverty rate was at its 
lowest in 60 years. The unemployment 
rate was the lowest in 50 years. Wage 
growth was the strongest in 40 years. 
The wage gap was narrowing, with 
blue-collar wages rising the fastest. 
Unemployment 
rates 
for 
minority 
groups and women were at the lowest 
ever recorded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H328 
February 4, 2021 
Then, over the course of just a few 
catastrophic weeks, our government 
took a wrecking ball to it all. In the 
second quarter, GDP plunged by one- 
third, the worst decline in productivity 
ever 
recorded. 
Unemployment 
sky-
rocketed to its highest levels since the 
Great Depression. Tens of millions of 
Americans lost their jobs. Trillions of 
dollars of the Nation’s wealth were 
squandered. 
In the months since, our children 
have been robbed of a year of their edu-
cation. Millions of Americans have 
been forbidden from earning a living by 
their own government. Shopkeepers 
have seen their life’s work destroyed, 
and when in desperation they try to 
hold on, they are led away in hand-
cuffs. 
Our most cherished rights to worship 
freely; to peaceably assemble; and not 
to be deprived of our lives, liberty, or 
property without due process of law 
have all been destroyed. 
Now, COVID did not cause this dam-
age. Public officials did. They promised 
us it was for our own good and that it 
would save lives. But mounting evi-
dence in multiple scientific studies is 
putting the lie to these sophistries. It 
is becoming increasingly, tragically, 
and bitterly clear that the lockdowns 
have not only failed to save lives, but 
they are costing lives. 
Last month, the University of Den-
mark released the results of a study 
comparing Danish municipalities that 
locked down with those that did not. 
Their conclusion: The lockdowns had 
‘‘statistically insignificant effects.’’ 
Their conclusion mirrored a similar 
study out of Stanford University that 
compared eight lockdown nations and 
two non-lockdown nations. They con-
cluded: ‘‘We fail to find an additional 
benefit of stay-at-home orders and 
business closures.’’ 
Now, these are studies based not on 
assumptions and models but on actual, 
real-life, hardcore data. That is what 
the science is telling us, and it is tell-
ing us the same thing for multiple 
studies: The lockdowns have not saved 
lives, certainly not to any statistically 
significant level. 
But it gets worse, much worse. We 
are now seeing mounting evidence that 
the lockdowns are costing lives on a 
staggering scale. Last month, the Na-
tional Bureau of Economic Research 
warned 
that 
increases 
in 
poverty 
caused by the lockdowns will cost more 
than 800,000 American lives over the 
next 15 years due to higher poverty lev-
els, with the deaths disproportionately 
affecting 
African 
Americans 
and 
women. That comports with a U.N. 
warning that tens of millions of people 
worldwide are being pushed to the 
brink of starvation. 
Suicide rates have jumped dramati-
cally over the past year. Dementia 
deaths between March and September 
jumped 13,000 as patients were left with 
little means of social interaction. San 
Francisco 
reported 
that 
additional 
deaths from drug overdoses exceeded 
the total COVID deaths in 2020. 
According to The Wall Street Jour-
nal, the CDC reported 475,000 excess 
deaths in the United States at a time 
when it was reporting 281,000 COVID- 
related fatalities. Now, that difference 
is 192,000 additional deaths unexplained 
by normal mortality and COVID com-
bined. 
Could it be this is the butcher’s bill 
from a folly that has produced sky-
rocketing suicides, drug and alcohol 
deaths, domestic homicides, isolation- 
related 
deaths, 
delayed 
health 
screenings, delayed health treatments, 
and poverty-related deaths? 
Unlike COVID, which is a curse 
brought us by nature, lockdown deaths 
are the fault of specific individuals in 
positions of public trust who imposed 
draconian restrictions out of panic, 
fear, 
ignorance, 
or 
egotism. 
They 
preened and virtue-signaled and boast-
ed how much they cared for the lives of 
others while they have pursued a folly 
that is needlessly taking an appalling 
toll of lives and livelihoods. 
Some of those responsible hold power 
by virtue of appointments by elected 
officials while others are elected offi-
cials themselves, and I fear this night-
mare will not end until the officials 
who are responsible for it are removed 
from the offices they hold.

HONORING ALBERT HALE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of former Navajo 
Nation President Albert Hale, who lost 
his battle with COVID this week. 
Years ago, Albert and I served to-
gether in the Arizona House of Rep-
resentatives, working on water issues 
and fighting to uphold Tribal sov-
ereignty. As the second elected presi-
dent of the Navajo Nation, Albert Hale 
taught me so much about the Dine peo-
ple, their culture, and their long-over-
looked struggles. 
In this body, we are no strangers to 
the suffering the Navajo Nation has en-
dured throughout the course of this 
pandemic—and still is. Forced to wait 
months for CARES Act funding to ar-
rive, Navajo families were often at the 
epicenter of this global pandemic, sev-
eral times experiencing the highest per 
capita infection rates in the world. 
As a Congress, we must, once and for 
all, commit ourselves to discontinuing 
the shelving of Native American issues 
and concerns. I know that is what Al-
bert Hale would have said. 
We must wholeheartedly devote our 
efforts to serving all Americans equi-
tably and come together reinvigorated 
to pass legislation to meet our obliga-
tions. 
Today, I think of Albert’s passing 
with a heavy heart for many reasons. I 
am saddened to lose his friendship and 
guidance, his smile, his sense of humor, 
and his sense of caring for his fellow 
Navajo and American people. And I am 
frustrated to see yet again that the 
community he fought to uplift con-
tinues to be left behind. Too many 
Dine mothers, grandfathers, neighbors, 
and friends have fallen to this deadly 
disease. 
Since coming to Congress in 2017, I 
have strived to bring the voices of all 
12 sovereign Tribal nations in our dis-
trict to the discussion table in Wash-
ington. Today, I recommit myself to 
fighting for their needs and honoring 
their unique stories, as Albert Hale did 
during his time with us. 
My thoughts are with the Hale fam-
ily and the entire Navajo Nation as we 
mourn Albert’s passing. His work, his 
light, and his mission will not be for-
gotten. 
And I can’t stand here today and not 
say that one of my last conversations 
with Albert was about COVID. 
I am so sad that he and many other 
people who have died from this dreaded 
disease have not been able to be with 
their loved ones as they have passed 
away, or their friends. I am saddened 
that I didn’t know at that time that 
Albert would have been stricken with 
this terrible virus. But we do know Al-
bert would say to us, Please continue 
to fight the fight for the American peo-
ple.

CONGRATULATING DR. KARLA 
SAPP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate a devoted ad-
vocate in my district, Dr. Karla Sapp, 
who was named the 2020 Mental Health 
Advocate of the Year by the Black 
Mental Health Symposium. 
Dr. Sapp has worked tirelessly to de-
crease the stigma of mental illness, in-
crease access to care, and improve the 
wellness of the individuals in her com-
munity. 
A native of Midway, Georgia, Dr. 
Sapp previously served with the Geor-
gia Department of Juvenile Justice. 
For the past 11 years, she has worked 
as a drug abuse program coordinator 
with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. I 
have had the honor of working with Dr. 
Sapp during her tenure at the Federal 
Correctional Institution of Jesup. 
Karla is a mother, sister, advocate, 
counselor, 
teacher, 
resource, 
motivator, and public servant. We are 
blessed to have Dr. Sapp working to 
better the lives of those suffering from 
mental illnesses, and I am thankful for 
her commitment to improving count-
less lives. 
I congratulate her on this amazing 
accomplishment, and I look forward to 
her continued journey of service and 
success.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H329 
February 4, 2021 
Ken Griner of Georgia’s First Congres-
sional District for his 33 years of serv-
ice in television and his many con-
tributions to Savannah, Georgia. 
Over the duration of his successful 
career, Ken began as a studio camera 
operator, then worked his way to cov-
ering late nights as WTOC’s sports di-
rector, and eventually became the hall-
mark coanchor at The News at Day-
break in historic Savannah, Georgia. 
Ken’s energetic, warm, and bubbly 
personality made him an invaluable 
and universally loved person within the 
television community, and I have per-
sonally enjoyed listening to his re-
marks. 
Ken has always been known as a fan 
favorite; warm and friendly; a helpful 
coworker; and, above all, a loving per-
son of all people. He is a pillar in Sa-
vannah, and I am thankful for his 
many years of dedicated work in media 
and for his whole-hearted investment 
in his community. I hold Ken in the 
highest regard and I wish him the best 
of luck in his future endeavors. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MACK MATTINGLY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Senator 
Mack Mattingly, who celebrated his 
90th birthday on January 7. Mack car-
ries a long list of accomplishments and 
prestigious titles and awards, but his 
heart for public service stands out the 
most. 
In the early 1950s, Mack served our 
country for 4 years in the United 
States Air Force and was stationed at 
Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, 
Georgia. He first became active in poli-
tics in 1964, when he served as chair-
man of U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater’s 
campaign for President in Georgia’s 
First Congressional District. 
In 1980, Mack defeated longtime 
Democratic Senator Herman Talmadge 
and served in the Senate from January 
1981 until January 1987. Mack was the 
first Republican to serve in the United 
States Senate from Georgia since Re-
construction. 
In 
his 
post-Senatorial 
campaign, 
President Reagan appointed Mack to 
serve as assistant secretary-general for 
defense support for NATO in Brussels, 
Belgium. He was later appointed as am-
bassador to Seychelles by President 
George Bush. Mack has contributed 
greatly to Georgia and to the United 
States as a whole through all the posi-
tions he held. 
I am thankful for his amazing life, 
and I wish him and his family the best 
in years to come. 
HONORING STEPHEN TOOTLE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Stephen Tootle of Savannah, Georgia, 
who recently passed away at the age of 
32 on December 20. 
Stephen was a man of remarkable 
character and a giving heart, who knew 
no stranger. He and his family were 
engrained in the local Savannah com-
munity, and everyone who knew him 
recognized his light-hearted person-
ality and passion for the outdoors. 
He was a 2006 graduate of Benedictine 
Military School and would go on to at-
tend the University of Georgia, where 
he was a member of the Lambda Chi 
Alpha fraternity. During this time, he 
made many lifelong friends. He grad-
uated from the University of Georgia 
in 2010, with a degree in risk manage-
ment and insurance, before he returned 
to his hometown of Savannah and 
worked as a commercial fisherman in 
his family’s crabbing business. 
Stephen was known as someone who 
saw the good in everyone and every-
thing and had a heart of gold. He also 
had a way of making anyone he met 
laugh. He was a courageous fighter who 
battled addiction, and I know his story 
will continue to touch many lives. 
Stephen leaves behind a wonderful, 
loving family who raised Stephen to be 
the amazing person he was, and I am 
thankful for the life he lived. My 
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily, friends, and all who knew him dur-
ing this most difficult time.

REMEMBERING 
HAWAII 
COUNTY 
MAYOR 
WILLIAM 
‘‘BILLY’’ 
P. 
KENOI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. KAHELE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
KAHELE. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
my 
ohana is from the last native Hawaiian 
fishing village in Hawaii, Milolii. You 
have likely never heard of Milolii, and 
if you haven’t heard of the small fish-
ing village of Milolii, then you prob-
ably haven’t heard of Kalapana. 
Kalapana, like Milolii, is an ocean 
community, but Kalapana sits in the 
shadow of the volcano Kilauea. For 
decades, this area has been shaped by 
the various destructive lava flows that 
have flowed through; but no matter 
how many times this happened, the 
people of Kalapana remained resilient 
and proud of their community. 
Mr. Speaker, I can think of no one 
who embodied the pride and resilience 
of being Kalapana born and raised than 
William 
Punapaia’alaikahala 
Kenoi, 
known to most as Hawaii Island Mayor 
Billy Kenoi. Billy Kenoi would proudly 
talk 
about 
the 
papaya 
fields 
of 
Kalapana and the mentors who helped 
him see the world outside of them. 
Their inspiration took him from the 
slopes of Kilauea to the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst. 
From there, the boy from Kalapana 
walked with reverence through these 
very Halls, which he regarded as a 
heiau, or spiritual center of democracy, 
as a congressional intern with the leg-
endary Senator Daniel K. Inouye. He 
then went on to attend the William S. 
Richardson School of Law at the Uni-
versity of Hawaii at Manoa. 
As he moved through his career, he 
remained that same resilient and proud 
kid from Kalapana. He worked for jus-
tice as a public defender with indigent 
clients. He moved home to Hawaii Is-
land as a public servant, dedicated to 
helping his island weather the crystal 
meth crisis that was ravaging our com-
munities. His leadership in crisis, born 
of 
the 
lava 
flows 
and 
fields 
of 
Kalapana, 
eventually 
translated 
to 
leadership at the island level, when he 
was elected as Hawaii County mayor in 
2008. 
Nobody could deny Billy’s charm, 
keen political drive, and charismatic 
leadership. And for all his high-level 
leadership and larger-than-life person-
ality, he left his mark in the individual 
interactions he had with people, always 
kind and authentic. Some of us had the 
fortune of getting to know him as a 
friend. For me, he was also a mentor. 
I will always remember Martin Lu-
ther King Day 2016, because it was the 
day my father had a heart attack and 
passed away a week later. In the cha-
otic hours after he passed, there were 
too many calls and texts of support to 
count and certainly too many to an-
swer. Despite all of this, one person’s 
grief persisted and pierced through the 
profound grief: Billy Kenoi. 
Billy called, asked where I was, and 
told me to come to the State Capitol. 
He said, ‘‘It was time.’’ I didn’t know 
what he meant by that. My father had 
just passed, but when Billy spoke, I lis-
tened. When a man who was once a boy 
from Kalapana calls you in the middle 
of a family crisis, you know that he 
summons with it the resilience and 
strength of an island community that 
persisted through lava flow after lava 
flow. 
I went to the State Capitol, to the 
desk of my father in the State Senate, 
surrounded by his colleagues, and my 
life was forever changed. Five years to 
the day after he passed, Billy Kenoi 
went into po himself, and he crossed 
into the afterlife. He left behind a 
beautiful wife, Takako, and three chil-
dren, Justin, Liam, and Mahina. He 
was only 52. And like my father, he was 
too important a leader to lose too soon. 
Billy 
was 
the 
personification 
of 
Kalapana. No matter what change life 
threw at him, he embraced it with 
pride, resilience, and a sense of humor. 
As Hawaii is now altered by the pass-
ing of this leader, we will conjure his 
spirit and the spirit of Kalapana. We 
will remember the boy from Kalapana 
who became the incomparable leader 
Billy Kenoi. 
Colleagues, I leave you with words 
from his final speech—and he was fa-
mous for speeches—to remember him 
and take us to a more resilient and 
prouder future: If impossible is noth-
ing, then everything is possible.

JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS IN 
SANCTUARY CITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I am here to 
talk for just a moment about law and 
order. I am here to talk about how we 
as a body can prevent more needless 
tragedies in our country. I am here to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H330 
February 4, 2021 
talk about true justice. Specifically, 
justice for victims of dangerous sanc-
tuary city policies. 
We have all heard the stories. Kate 
Steinle brutally murdered in San Fran-
cisco by an illegal immigrant who was 
repeatedly released. 
In 
Washington 
State, 
an 
illegal 
named Rosalio Ramos-Romas was de-
ported four times before authorities ar-
rested him in October of 2017. Once no-
tified of his arrest, ICE issued a de-
tainer request asking local authorities 
to imprison him for an additional 48 
hours. But, instead, local authorities 
ignored the detainer request and al-
lowed Rosalio back into the commu-
nity, where he eventually murdered his 
cousin and hid the body in a dumpster. 
In my State of North Carolina, the 
Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office 
refused to notify ICE and comply with 
lawful detainer requests when it re-
leased dangerous illegal immigrants 
from the county jail. One was charged 
with multiple domestic violence of-
fenses for strangling a woman and 
threatening to kill her. 
These are not isolated incidents of vi-
olence, but, rather, the norm in sanc-
tuary cities across America. The truth 
is that sanctuary city policies are un-
necessary and they only threaten the 
safety of our families and our neigh-
bors. This lawlessness leads to trage-
dies that are simply not acceptable and 
should not be allowed by our leaders. 
That is why I introduced the Justice 
for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act 
with Senator THOM
TILLIS. Our bill 
would allow anyone harmed by an ille-
gal immigrant in a sanctuary city to 
sue the sanctuary city or State for the 
damages that it caused. It also with-
holds certain grant funding from juris-
dictions that refuse to comply with 
Federal law. This move will put lawless 
cities on notice and will, hopefully, 
persuade them to reverse course, en-
force our laws, and keep our streets 
safe. 
At a time when the current adminis-
tration refuses to crack down on sanc-
tuary cities, Congress has the responsi-
bility to act. It is long past time that 
cities who refuse to enforce our immi-
gration face legal consequences. This 
has to stop. 
UNEVEN ALLOCATION OF THE COVID–19 VACCINE 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, last month, 
over 10,000 patients in and around my 
district had their COVID–19 vaccina-
tion appointments forcibly canceled, 
throwing seniors and frontline workers 
into uncertainty. This mistake was the 
result of an uneven allocation process 
and bureaucratic confusion. It is unac-
ceptable and something has to be done. 
I sent a letter to the Department of 
Health and Human Services demanding 
immediate answers for my constitu-
ents. I understand that an expedited 
national vaccine rollout is complex. It 
is a tough undertaking. But the faster 
vaccine doses are allocated to States 
like mine in North Carolina, the sooner 
we will be able to defeat this virus once 
and for all. 
The people of my community deserve 
clarity and honesty when it comes to 
vaccines from the Federal Government, 
and I am going to continue to get an-
swers for them. 
ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme 
Court decision in Roe v. Wade was de-
cided 48 years ago last month. Since 
abortion was made legal, more than 60 
million unborn children have had their 
lives prematurely ended. This is a mat-
ter of conscience for me, and I believe 
that life begins at conception. 
In recent years, advances in science 
and medicine have given us an increas-
ingly vivid picture of what life in the 
womb is like. A child has a heartbeat 
at just 6 weeks. A child feels pain at 20 
weeks. 
Science makes clear that life exists 
in the womb and, therefore, an unborn 
child is entitled to the most funda-
mental of human rights, and that, Mr. 
Speaker, is the right to live. 
This issue transcends what it means 
to be an American and goes to the core 
of what makes us human. I hope that 
one day soon, the Supreme Court cor-
rects their constitutional error so that 
the American people can reassert their 
voice in determining the moral ques-
tion of our time.

HONORING THE LIVES AND SERV-
ICE 
OF 
FBI 
SPECIAL 
AGENTS 
DANIEL 
ALFIN 
AND 
LAURA 
SCHWARTZENBERGER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that 
I rise to honor the lives of two fallen 
FBI agents, Daniel Alfin and Laura 
Schwartzenberger. 
On Tuesday morning, while executing 
a Federal warrant in a child exploi-
tation investigation, Special Agent 
Daniel Alfin and Special Agent Laura 
Schwartzenberger were shot and killed 
in the line of duty in Sunrise, Florida. 
They died protecting our most vulner-
able citizens and the community they 
loved. 
This was, sadly, the FBI’s deadliest 
day since the tragic events on 9/11. It 
has also been more than 30 years since 
two agents were gunned down together 
in the line of duty. 
A 16-year veteran of the FBI, Special 
Agent Laura Schwartzenberger’s spe-
cialty was pursuing crimes against 
children. Her work with the FBI Miami 
field office’s Innocent Images national 
initiative led to the arrest of those in-
volved in the exploitation of children 
and ‘‘sextortion.’’ She leaves behind a 
husband and two children. 
Special Agent Daniel Alfin was a 12- 
year veteran of the FBI. He was a vet-
eran agent who led the investigation 
into a dark website called Playpen, one 
of the country’s largest child pornog-
raphy operations. He also leaves behind 
a wife and one child. 
While I did not have the good fortune 
of knowing these two special agents, I 
know this: These were two heroes 
taken from us, and we lost them way 
too soon. These were incredible parents 
torn from their families. They were ex-
traordinary public servants trying to 
make our community a safer place to 
raise our families. 
To their loved ones and colleagues, I 
struggle to find words that can offer 
solace and comfort in their time of dis-
tress. The great poet William Words-
worth once said: ‘‘Not without hope we 
suffer and we mourn.’’ 
Perhaps he meant that we find hope 
in the belief that our thoughts and 
prayers will, in time, heal their fami-
lies and their colleagues, and in the 
hope and the belief that the children of 
these fallen heroes will grow up know-
ing that their parents made the sac-
rifice to make their world and our 
world a better place. 
Agents Alfin and Schwartzenberger 
put their lives on the line every day to 
help us be safer. We lost them to a 
senseless act of violence by someone 
with a total disregard for the lives of 
others. We lost them to evil. 
We grieve their loss, not only to the 
community they served, but to the 
families and loved ones that they leave 
behind. They made the ultimate sac-
rifice and, for that, Americans will be 
forever in their debt and forever grate-
ful. 
May their memories be a blessing.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BILL 
REYNOLDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
GARCIA 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a fallen 
hero who graced our glorious Nation 
for 47 years. Mr. Bill Reynolds, one of 
my best friends and a loyal wingman, 
crossed into heaven to be alongside the 
Lord on January 11. 
As a young man, Bill also crossed 
oceans to fight for this Nation in the 
jungles of Vietnam in 1967. In fact, he 
was one of the few surviving members 
of the well-known ‘‘The Boys of ‘67,’’ 
the Army’s Charlie Company, 9th Divi-
sion, 4th Battalion, 47th Infantry Regi-
ment. 
He was wounded in combat on the 
Mekong Delta on June 19, 1967, in one 
of the fiercest days of the Vietnam war 
during the Battle of My Lai. Despite 
being wounded, Bill continued to fight 
alongside his fellow Americans as they 
took on heavy fire. His brave service 
earned him the Bronze Star as well as 
the Purple Heart. 
From an early age, Bill was a scrap-
per. He was a real patriot. He loved his 
friends, he loved his family, but his 
deepest love was for the United States 
of America and those who served to 
protect her. The blood he shed and the 
sacrifices that he made overseas during

combat operations were matched only 
by his commitment and his passion to 
take care of veterans back home. 
In fact, in my hometown of Santa 
Clarita, there is a veterans’ memorial 
that stands today because of Bill’s hard 
work and his advocacy. In the halls of 
a local veterans’ support center, there 
are several dozen biographies of our 
city’s local heroes, our veterans; and 
all of these biographies were written by 
Bill after he personally sat down, inter-
viewed, and discussed their experiences 
with them each, individually. 
Bill loved our veterans because he 
understood what it meant to truly 
serve, and he understood what it meant 
to truly sacrifice. In his own words he 
said: ‘‘America was founded on the 
courage to fight for freedom, and that 
is what the veteran community does. 
They take pride in that. There is no 
better family than the veteran commu-
nity,’’ he said. 
Bill was a steward of those who pro-
tected our Nation. A warrior with a big 
heart and a sheepdog with a big bark 
and an even bigger fight, and he knew 
what that flag, Mr. Speaker, stood for, 
and he would do anything to protect it. 
And underneath all the passion and 
fight was a kind and gentle man, one of 
the most soft-spoken and caring men I 
have ever known, a husband to Meg, a 
role model to his sons, and a friend to 
thousands. 
Bill knew better than anyone that 
our Nation is a precious one and that 
its survival is not pre-ordained. 
He knew that our Nation is some-
times vulnerable. It is an experiment of 
government still in its infancy, a de-
veloping Nation that is underpinned by 
goodwill and dependent on the labors of 
good Americans willing to serve her 
and to fight for her for the right rea-
sons. 
We are indeed a Nation that some-
times wobbles and, in doing so, we re-
quire the steady hands of patriots and 
leaders. We are a Nation that is kept 
stable by the exertions of great Ameri-
cans. People like Bill Reynolds. 
Bill was an American who cared until 
the very end and will continue to look 
over us and our precious Nation like 
the loyal wingman that he has always 
been. 
May God bless Bill Reynolds and his 
family. And may God bless this great 
Nation that he gave so much and 
fought so hard for.

LIFE IS SACRED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in memory and to honor the 
millions of babies killed since the Roe 
v. Wade decision almost 50 years ago. 
There is nothing more precious than 
the gift of life, given to us by God, who 
knew us before He formed us in our 
mother’s womb. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. The gentleman 
will put on the mask, please. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, 
there is nothing more precious than 
the gift of life given to us by God, who 
knew us before He formed us in the 
womb. 
Mr. Speaker, life is sacred, and it is 
heartbreaking that there are those 
across this country and in Congress 
who reject that truth and view abor-
tion as nothing more than a medical 
procedure. 
Sadly, 
a 
professed 
Catholic 
who 
knows better has already taken steps 
to increase the killing of babies across 
the world and make innocent taxpayers 
foot the bill. 
He has revoked the Mexico City pol-
icy, which means American taxpayers 
will now be sending dollars overseas to 
support the killing of unborn babies in 
foreign countries. And he is actively 
working to eliminate the Hyde amend-
ment, which is a longstanding, bipar-
tisan doctrine that prevents taxpayer 
funds from paying for the killing of ba-
bies in the United States. 
Let’s be clear, abortion is murder, 
not healthcare. 
Abortion is not the answer to a 
child’s mental or physical challenges. I 
am reminded today of the words of 
Frank Stephens, a Special Olympian. 
Many of you heard him speak here at 
Congress. He is now living with Down 
syndrome. He said this: ‘‘About abor-
tion, I don’t want to make it illegal, I 
want to make it unthinkable. Politi-
cians change laws. I want to change 
people’s hearts.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I agree with Frank Ste-
phens, but I believe we can do both. We 
can change lives and we can change 
people’s hearts.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize three ‘‘Legacy Lead-
ers’’ from my district in Nebraska for 
Black History Month. 
Every February, we celebrate the 
achievements of African Americans 
and recognize their pivotal roles in the 
history of our great country. This year, 
I recognize Ella Willis, Teela Mickles, 
and Bettie McDonald, who have worked 
diligently to leave a meaningful and 
lasting impact on the Omaha commu-
nity. 
Originally from North Carolina, our 
first Legacy Leader, Ella Willis, came 
to Omaha in 1967, right after the race 
riots. After seeing the damage and de-
struction from the riots not being re-
paired, she joined the Neighborhood 
Action and Fact Association, founded 
by Andy ‘‘Handy’’ Wright. 
Around 2004, Mrs. Willis became the 
president 
of 
the 
association. 
She 
worked to secure grant funding for the 
beautification of 24th Street and the 
neighborhood garden and marketplace 
building. The association assisted with 
the painting of murals along the 24th 
Street corridor, including The Union 
for Contemporary Art. 
In 2005, under Mrs. Willis’ leadership, 
the association received the Environ-
mental Improvement Award from the 
Urban Community Improvement Pro-
gram. Her community advocacy start-
ed long before, when she joined the 
NAACP in the early sixties, while her 
husband served in Vietnam. She par-
ticipated in the voting registration 
process, protesting for the right for 
Black women to vote and registering 
Black men. 
Mrs. Willis thanks God for Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr., and praises his be-
lief in justice, hope, love, and non-
violence, saying, ‘‘This is what we 
must learn together as brothers and 
sisters of God. Have love and faith in 
your heart.’’ 
Another Legacy Leader is Teela A. 
Mickles, the founder and CEO of Com-
passion in Action, a faith-based, non-
profit organization that serves individ-
uals confined in the State correctional 
facilities and families affected by in-
carceration. 
Mrs. Mickles became a single parent 
to five young children after an unfortu-
nate turn in life and later attended col-
lege, earning her associate degree in 
Chemical Dependency Counseling. At 
the same time, she developed Compas-
sion in Action’s Pre-Release Education/ 
Reentry Preparation Program, with 
her motto of ‘‘Embracing the person, 
rebuilding the family, and breaking the 
cycle.’’ 
She has been recognized for her dedi-
cation and accomplishments through 
the years: The UNO Woman of Color 
Award, Heartland Family Services’ 
Family Advocacy Award, and the City 
of Omaha Excellence Award, and many, 
many more. 
Mrs. Mickles is also an ordained min-
ister on staff at Mission Church and 
credits the success of her organization 
to her strong faith in God and belief 
that every person is viable. As she 
says: ‘‘If you’re not dead, God’s not 
done.’’ 
Our third Legacy Leader is Bettie 
McDonald, cofounder of Native Omaha 
Days, a week-long homecoming event 
that celebrates the community’s his-
torical and cultural legacies. 
Born and raised in Omaha, Bettie be-
longs to the Bryant-Fisher family, 
hailed as one of the most prodigious 
Black families in Nebraska. After grad-
uating from the Allhouse School of 
Beauty and Culture, she became owner 
of her own beauty shop of over 50 years, 
The Economy Beauty Salon. 
The vision for a reunion of native 
Omahans was first arranged in 1976 and 
less than a year later the original 
founding 
planning 
members, 
Vera 
Johnson and Bettie McDonald, started 
a tradition of the week-long celebra-
tion. It is now known as Native Omaha 
Days and, every 2 years, has brought 
people to Omaha from across the coun-
try. 
Approaching its 22nd biennial, Native 
Omaha Days has reached a peak, influ-
encing cultural programming along 
24th Street and adjacent North Omaha 
neighborhoods.

THE CURRENT STATE OF THE 
COVID–19 PANDEMIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as my home State of Illinois 
approaches the grave milestone of 
20,000 COVID–19 deaths. 
I am thinking of the families of each 
of our neighbors we have lost, and I am 
also thinking of everyone in our com-
munity who is currently suffering from 
the physical, psychological, and finan-
cial consequences of the pandemic. 
The past year has been so hard for so 
many of us, and it is not over. We still 
have a long way to go until our fami-
lies’ health and economic well-being is 
secure. 
Now, thanks to the work of incred-
ible scientists, we have authorized vac-
cines that are safe and effective, offer-
ing a level of protection that can save 
lives and crush this virus. 
But until we actually get shots in 
arms, the virus will continue to spread. 
This process has been difficult, and the 
bottom line is that our current vaccine 
process is not sustainable. But we can 
change that. We must change that. 
The good news is that we can. We 
have a new administration laser-fo-
cused on ramping up distribution, and 
there are investments to be made in 
order to help. 
Local health departments are over-
whelmed with phone calls from people 
wondering where to go for a vaccine. 
Web-based appointment signups are 
filling faster than people can register. 
Immunization providers lack the re-
sources to carry out vaccination cam-
paigns at this unprecedented scale. 
To address these challenges and 
carry out an efficient COVID–19 vac-
cination campaign that prioritizes the 
people who need them most, Congress 
needs to act swiftly and boldly. The 
next relief bill must include significant 
funding to accelerate vaccine adminis-
tration with a particular focus on pro-
viding vaccine doses and outreach to 
ensure that nobody is left behind. 
We also need to fund the workforce 
that will carry out vaccination efforts, 
as well as testing, contact tracing, and 
other critical initiatives to stop the 
spread of the virus. 
I have introduced two bills, the Com-
munity Immunity During COVID–19 
Act and the Health Force, Resilience 
Force, and Jobs to Fight COVID–19 
Act, to make the investments that will 
be needed to end the pandemic, prevent 
the next public health crisis, and en-
sure a strong economic recovery. 
Finally, as we continue to confront a 
once-in-a-century health crisis, it is 
absolutely unacceptable that millions 
of Americans continue to lack access 
to affordable healthcare. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 369, the 
Health Care Affordability Act, which 
would increase the dollar amount of 
premium tax credits across all income 
levels. 
It would eliminate premiums for 
lower-income households; reduce pre-
mium costs by hundreds or thousands 
of dollars for middle-class families, in-
cluding those who currently make too 
much money to qualify for the tax 
credit; and ensure that everyone would 
be able to buy a plan for no more than 
8.5 percent of their income. For fami-
lies in northern Illinois who currently 
pay 15, 18, or 20 percent of their income 
for healthcare, this is real savings that 
matters. 
This was included in the President’s 
American Rescue Plan, and I urge my 
colleagues to support its inclusion in 
the next relief package. 
At this challenging moment in his-
tory, the decisions we make will be felt 
for generations. If our ideas are too 
small, the consequences not only mean 
a protracted pandemic but a stunted 
economic recovery. 
But if we pursue solutions that meet 
this moment, we can not only get to 
the other side of the pandemic, we can 
emerge from it stronger than before, 
with evidence-based public health in-
vestments that prevent future crises; 
with career pathways that usher in a 
new era of economic growth; and with 
a healthcare system built on a founda-
tion of equity, where access to quality 
care is not the privilege of a few but 
the right of all. 
I believe that this future is possible, 
and I know that the decisions we make 
today will shape it. I hope my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle are 
ready to do the work we were sent here 
to do.

CONGRATULATING ETHAN KNARR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and 
congratulate 
Ethan 
Knarr 
of 
DuBois, Pennsylvania. Ethan recently 
accepted a fully qualified appointment 
to the United States Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, Maryland. 
Ethan is the son of Christopher and 
Danielle Knarr and the grandson of 
Daniel and Linda Schaffer of DuBois, 
Leona Knarr of Troutville, and Doug 
Grube and the late Elizabeth Ann 
Grube of DuBois. 
As a student at DuBois Area High 
School, Ethan has been an active mem-
ber of the National Honor Society and 
the cross-country team, and he served 
as captain of the tennis team. 
Outside of school, Ethan has been 
heavily involved in the Boy Scouts of 
America, having served as historian, 
assistant senior patrol leader, and 
eventually senior patrol leader of his 
troop. Ethan became an Eagle Scout in 
March 2020. 
I would like to thank Ethan for his 
commitment to service and wish him 
the very best as he embarks on this ex-
citing new phase of life in Annapolis. 
RECOGNIZING PETE RICKARD 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and 
congratulate 
Pete 
Rickard 
of 
Strattanville, Pennsylvania, for ac-
cepting a fully qualified appointment 
to the United States Air Force Acad-
emy in Colorado. 
Pete is a student at Clarion-Lime-
stone High School. During his time at 
Clarion-Limestone, Pete has been a 
member of the Academic Decathlon 
team, lettered in basketball, and active 
in FFA, or Future Farmers of America. 
He is now a senior member of the 
Civil Air Patrol Clarion Composite 
Squadron 504 and is active in the 
Greater Pennsylvania American Red 
Cross. 
Pete credits his success to the love 
and support he has received from fam-
ily and friends, including Rod and 
Debbie Frampton, as well as his four 
sisters, Lucy, Ann, Katie, and Bonnie. 
Undoubtedly, Pete’s academic suc-
cess and experience with the Civil Air 
Patrol will serve him well as he starts 
this exciting new chapter at the Air 
Force Academy. 
Best wishes to Pete, and I look for-
ward to seeing all that he achieves. 
RECOGNIZING LISA WINGER 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Lisa Winger of Oil City. Lisa was re-
cently recognized by the Venango Area 
Chamber of Commerce as the 2020 Cit-
izen of the Year. 
According to the chamber, nominees 
are those who, ‘‘in the face of danger, 
combat adversity through feats of inge-
nuity, courage, or strength, and those 
who perform great deeds or selfless 
acts for the common good.’’ 
Susan Williams, executive director of 
the chamber, noted nominations for 
Lisa mentioned her impeccable char-
acter and that she was highly re-
spected, a leader, and selfless. 
Lisa works at the AseraCare Hospice, 
where she counsels residents and their 
families by providing compassion, com-
fort, and advice. 
She truly lives a life of service. Out-
side of her work with AseraCare, Lisa 
has also established an Alzheimer’s 
support group at the Oil City YMCA, 
and she leads the county’s Toys for 
Tots program. 
A friend of Lisa’s said in her nomina-
tion that Lisa ‘‘works tirelessly for 
Venango County and dedicates herself 
to everything she does.’’ 
I would like to congratulate Lisa on 
this much-deserved recognition and 
thank her for her commitment to serv-
ing her community.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MAXY 
HUGH HAMMOND 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the accomplish-
ments and life of a true family man 
and public servant, Maxy Hugh Ham-
mond. Maxy was born in Lancaster, 
South Carolina, on October 19, 1956. 
Maxy was from a family that was 
heavily involved in every facet of serv-
ice. His father, Maxy Sr., was very ac-
tive in serving in the Lancaster com-
munity, having served on the Lan-
caster School Board and Lancaster 
City Council for years and ‘‘whetted 
the appetite’’ for his son to serve the 
public, which he did for many years, in-
cluding serving on the Lancaster Coun-
ty Council, United Way, Chamber of 
Commerce, Rotary Club, Economic De-
velopment Board, Boy Scout Council, 
school 
improvement 
councils, 
and 
many more boards and commissions. 
Maxy began his work career 45 years 
ago, including 7 years with the Ca-
tawba nuclear plant; Springs Industries 
for 12 years, where he worked in the en-
gineering department; Kanawha Insur-
ance in sales for 15 years; and vice 
president of Founders Federal Credit 
Union for 10 years, retiring on Decem-
ber 31, 2020. 
Maxy has been married for 42 years 
to Jennifer Starnes Hammond and has 
two children, his son, Garrett, and his 
wife, 
Elizabeth; 
and 
his 
daughter, 
Holly, who is married to Matthew 
Whitley. 
The joys of Maxy and Jennifer’s life 
are their two granddaughters, Avery 
Oak, who will be 2 years old in June, 
and Maryn Reese, who will be 1 year 
old in April. 
I had the privilege of viewing and lis-
tening to a series of testimonials post-
ed on Facebook about Maxy and what 
he and his family have meant to the 
greater Lancaster community, which 
included heartfelt comments by his 
family, his friends, and his coworkers 
from all walks of life. 
Those who knew him the best had 
this to say: 
‘‘Our office is like a six-pack, and 
Maxy is the plastic ring that holds our 
office together.’’ 
‘‘He never puts himself first. It is 
about everyone else.’’ 
‘‘If this building was burning down, 
he would circle the building two to 
three times before worrying about him-
self.’’ 
‘‘Maxy doesn’t care about titles, ac-
colades, or recognition. It is all about 
others.’’ 
‘‘If Maxy can make everyone else 
happy, that is all he wants.’’ 
Maxy Hammond is a true public serv-
ant who has lived his life for his God, 
his family, and his country. 
On behalf of the Members of the 117th 
United States Congress, I wish you 
Godspeed in your retirement years as 
you spend time with your family and 
your many friends on the heavenly 
beaches of the Carolinas. 
f 
MIDDLE OF IT ALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I am hum-
bled to deliver my first speech on the 
House floor today and discuss the fu-
ture of our great Nation. 
I grew up on a farm south of Quinter, 
Kansas, that my parents and brother 
still operate. The house my parents 
live in, and the house I grew up in, is 
the same house my great-great-grand-
father ordered from a Montgomery 
Ward catalog in the early 1900s. 
Growing up there meant I spent 
thousands of hours on a tractor work-
ing in the fields and on horseback doc-
toring cattle in the family feed yard. 
Those hours turned into love of coun-
try and lessons about the value of hard 
work. 
My Kansas roots run deep, and my 
desire to serve our country is wider 
than a country mile. I ran for Congress 
to advocate for agriculture and our 
conservative Kansas values. Kansans 
are good people who carry a pioneering 
spirit with them, in the same way 
those who settled my State did over 160 
years ago. 
The people of Kansas 1, the Big First, 
know each other, look out for each 
other, and sacrifice for each other. The 
district is home to more than 60,000 
farms and is made up of farmers, 
ranchers, feedlot managers, nutrition-
ists, ethanol producers, ag lenders, and 
agribusiness owners who feed, fuel, and 
clothe the world. 
As Congress becomes increasingly 
more urban, the distance from farm to 
fork has never been greater, and the 
Big First depends on strong voices for 
agriculture in Congress. That is why I 
am honored to serve on the House Agri-
culture Committee. 
At the very top center of the Big 
First sits Lebanon, Kansas, a seem-
ingly ordinary small town. About 21⁄2 
miles northwest of Lebanon is the 
exact middle of the contiguous 48 
States. A few months ago, a group of us 
met in Lebanon and prayed for our Na-
tion and that God’s will would be done 
and that our future would be bright. 
There is something about being in 
the middle of the country where farm-
ers pray for rain, parents drive 30 miles 
one way to take their kids to school, 
and communities shrink and grow with 
oil and gas prices that gives you a 
great perspective. To really be in the 
middle of it all, though, we must de-
mand results. 
I have received many calls from fam-
ily farmers in the Big First gravely 
concerned with President Biden’s exec-
utive order restricting travel from 
countries like South Africa, where 
many of our legal farmworkers come 
from during harvest. I will tell you, if 
an issue matters to a Kansan, it mat-
ters to me. 
I worked with a number of my col-
leagues here to issue a letter to Presi-
dent Biden, asking that he exempt es-
sential workers, like those in agri-
culture, from his travel ban. Soon 
after, we were told the President would 
grant the exemption. But to me, an ex-
emption to an overreaching executive 
order is not enough. 
After watching President Biden issue 
25 executive orders in his first 10 days 
as President, more than the last seven 
Presidents combined during their first 
10 days, I decided I could no longer sit 
idle and watch executive orders dictate 
the direction of this country with no 
input from Congress. The executive 
branch was not created to legislate— 
Congress was. 
We are now up to 42 executive orders 
from the Biden White House. That is 
why, earlier this week, I introduced the 
More Accountability is Necessary Now 
acts, six pieces of legislation pro-
moting 
accountability 
and 
trans-
parency to the administration’s future 
executive orders. 
The MANN acts require that the ex-
ecutive branch notify the American 
public and Congress of its intent to 
issue any new executive orders per-
taining to agriculture, energy, the en-
vironment, pro-life provisions, the Sec-
ond Amendment, and immigration. 
The short-term impact of legislation 
like this would be to hold our elected 
leaders more accountable. But for the 
long term, we must never forget that 
America is the greatest and most noble 
experiment that has ever been endeav-
ored. 
When our Founding Fathers used the 
three words ‘‘by their Creator’’ 245 
years ago, they unleashed freedom on 
humanity, because for the first time in 
history, people stood up and declared 
that freedoms do not flow from a king 
or government; they flow from God. 
The power of that truth can never be 
stomped out because it rings loudly in 
the hearts and minds of Americans 
from coast to coast and certainly in 
the Big First, which in many ways is 
the pilot light of America. In my dis-
trict, the basic values of faith, family, 
and freedom are alive and well. It is 
our responsibility to never let that 
light go out. 
b 1100 
I believe that when we get into the 
middle of issues, roll up our sleeves, 
get to work, and do the heavy lifting, 
we gain better perspectives and better 
results. Being in the middle of it all in-
stead of being stapled to our desks in 
Washington, D.C., makes us all better 
and is good for America. 
Get in the middle of it. Stand face to 
face and engage. Spend time to think, 
pray, and reflect, like I did that day in 
the exact center of the country. I 
promise you will gain a better under-
standing of where we need to go as a 
nation. 
I did not run for Congress to be a 
caretaker in the slow demise of Amer-
ica. I ran so I could fight and work to

THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
Chamber for the first time in my serv-
ice to the 23rd District of Texas. 
My 
path 
to 
Congress 
has 
been 
marked by many obstacles. At age 18, I 
left high school to join the Navy and 
provide a path to success for my fam-
ily. As I embarked on a 20-year career 
as a cryptologist, I deployed to Iraq 
and Afghanistan and gained a deep un-
derstanding of the security issues that 
currently affect our Nation. 
Today, many of those issues are visi-
ble along our Southern border, espe-
cially within my district, which spans 
over 800 miles between the U.S. and 
Mexico border. The challenges facing 
our district are compounded by the 
minute, and it is imperative that Con-
gress take action. 
Mr. Speaker, as I have made my way 
around the district, I have seen first-
hand the men and women who are 
doing the work. People like Sheriff 
Martinez in Val Verde County, like 
Sheriff Coe in Kinney County. We have 
other sheriffs throughout. We have 
Chief Guajardo in Eagle Pass and Chief 
Rodriguez in Uvalde. We have Sheriff 
Dodson. These are the men and women 
on the ground every day doing the 
work. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
the Security First Act, to ensure our 
borders are safe, resilient, and adaptive 
to 21st century challenges. One of the 
primary objectives to my bill is to au-
thorize an increase in grant funding for 
Operation Stonegarden. 
As a key pillar of our border security 
framework, 
Operation 
Stonegarden 
provides resources to local law enforce-
ment agencies involved in Customs and 
Border Protection operations. By ena-
bling our sheriffs and police depart-
ments to collaborate with CBP and 
United States Border Patrol, Operation 
Stonegarden helps create a layered ap-
proach to border security and encour-
ages a joint collaboration across all 
levels 
of 
Government. 
Operation 
Stonegarden funds can be used to pur-
chase field equipment to enhance oper-
ational efficiencies. 
The United States has long been a 
leader in technology. So equipping our 
boots on the ground with sophisticated 
tools to do their job is exactly what is 
needed. After speaking to countless law 
enforcement agents in my district, it is 
clear that more funding for this pro-
gram is needed. A surge at our South-
ern border is occurring. 
The Security First Act proposes a 4- 
year increase to current Stonegarden 
funding levels and requires that all 
moneys seized from drug trafficking 
activities at the Southern border be 
funneled to the Stonegarden account. 
By strengthening our ability to cope 
with evolving security challenges, the 
Security First Act helps protect the in-
tegrity of our Southern border.

HONORING DEBBIE MOSELEY ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the services of Ms. Deborah 
‘‘Debbie’’ Moseley, the executive direc-
tor of The Bridge Over Troubled Waters 
in Pasadena, Texas. Commonly referred 
to as ‘‘The Bridge,’’ this organization 
has assisted men, women, and children 
affected by domestic and sexual vio-
lence or homelessness in southeastern 
Harris County, Texas. 
For 34 years, Debbie has served the 
organization as an advocate in the field 
of domestic and sexual violence. Debbie 
began working as a volunteer at The 
Bridge in 1986, alongside her mother 
and grandmother. A year later, she 
started working with The Bridge’s chil-
dren’s programs on Tuesday and Thurs-
day evenings. In 1988, Debbie began to 
work full time at The Bridge as a resi-
dent advocate. 
Over the years, she has held many 
leadership positions in each of the dif-
ferent programs that The Bridge offers, 
including shelter coordinator, resale 
shop coordinator, nonresident director, 
and advocacy director. In 2003, Debbie 
was named the executive director and 
has served in that role ever since. 
Under 
Debbie’s 
leadership, 
The 
Bridge 
connected 
with 
community 
leaders and the community at large; 
built a new location; and started Des-
tiny Village, a long-term housing pro-
gram for survivors of violence with dis-
abilities and children. In addition, she 
has 
significantly 
increased 
The 
Bridge’s share of funding granted by 
the Victims of Crime Act to provide 
critical support services to victims of 
domestic violence. 
Debbie is a licensed social worker 
and has dedicated her life to commu-
nity and volunteer service. She serves 
on the boards of numerous community 
organizations, such as the Harris Coun-
ty Coordinating Council, the Texas 
Council on Family Violence, the Harris 
County Adult Fatality Review Team, 
the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, 
the Pasadena Police Academy, and the 
Bridges to Life prison ministry. She is 
also active in the New Hope Church of 
Pearland, the Pasadena Kiwanis, the 
Bay Area Kiwanis, the Pasadena Ro-
tary, the Salvation Army, and the 
Texas Invitational. 
For her community and civic in-
volvement, Debbie has received numer-
ous recognitions, including the Gov-
ernor’s Victim Services Division Path-
finder Award in 2007; Debbie Moseley 
Day in Pasadena, Texas; the Rotary 
Club’s Paul Harris Fellow Award in 
2010; Rotary Director of the Year in 
2016; and the Stella Trimble Commu-
nity Service Award in 2017. 
In 1985, Debbie married the love of 
her life, Tom Moseley. Debbie is the 
mother of four children: John Miles of 
Burleson, Texas; Aaron Miles, also of 
Burleson; Derek Miles of League City; 
and Staff Sergeant Josh Moseley, who 
is stationed as a United States Marine 
Corps recruiter in Arlington, Texas. 
Debbie and Tom are the proud grand-
parents of eight grandchildren. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
Debbie Moseley for her lifetime of dedi-
cated service to the survivors of domes-
tic and sexual violence, and I wish her 
the very absolute best during her well- 
deserved retirement.

MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ILLINOIS, 
BICENTENNIAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 
the bicentennial celebration of the 
founding of Montgomery County, Illi-
nois. 
Montgomery County was formed Feb-
ruary 12, 1821, and named in honor of 
Revolutionary War General Richard 
Montgomery. Montgomery County has 
a rich history, including being a friend 
to Illinois’ favorite son, Abraham Lin-
coln, and providing a stretch of his-
toric Route 66. 
Montgomery County continues to be 
a vibrant community that supports 
family, sports, fine arts, churches, and 
numerous organizations for more than 
30,000 residents that make up 20 mu-
nicipalities. I am proud to represent 
Montgomery County and the many 
people who make it a wonderful place 
to live. 
Congratulations to everyone in the 
county on celebrating their bicenten-
nial. 
THANK YOU TO DAVID A. NORTHERN, SR. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
David A. Northern, Sr., for his leader-
ship and service to the people of Cham-
paign County, Illinois. 
I have had the privilege to work with 
David through his role as the chief ex-
ecutive officer of the Housing Author-
ity of Champaign County, an organiza-
tion which provides housing and re-
lated services to the most vulnerable 
populations in our community. He 
oversaw various programs that pro-
vided housing opportunities and assist-
ance to over 13,000 citizens. 
Under David’s leadership, the agency 
launched numerous projects to develop 
affordable housing, update existing 
properties, and bolster support pro-
grams. David believes that the Housing 
Authority’s mission is just as much 
about transforming futures and putting 
families on a path to economic self-suf-
ficiency as it is to just providing 
homes. That vision and drive has 
served him well.

H335 
February 4, 2021 
David’s distinguished career and ex-
perience in Federal housing assistance 
has been a blessing to Champaign 
County. While we will certainly miss 
him in Illinois, we wish him the very 
best as he begins a new journey as the 
president and CEO of the Housing Au-
thority of Birmingham District in Ala-
bama, the largest in the State. 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, wish to thank 
my friend David Northern for his serv-
ice to Champaign County and con-
gratulate him and wish him the best in 
his new home in Alabama. 
REMEMBERING DAVID PICKETT 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of David 
Pickett, my friend from Taylorville, Il-
linois, who sadly passed away right be-
fore Christmas. 
David graduated from Taylorville 
High School in 1977, and then grad-
uated from Western Illinois University 
in 1981, with degrees in accounting and 
computer science. 
He will be remembered in our com-
munity for his entrepreneurial spirit, 
his photography skills, and for his love 
of sharing with others in the commu-
nity. His most memorable feat in 
Taylorville will be taking the hobby of 
photography and turning it into a busi-
ness called Fun Photo. It was his own 
sports photography business. I saw 
David at sports events, and I still have 
pictures of my young kids in youth 
football and youth baseball that line 
my household because David was there. 
He was part of our community and he 
was part of our kids. 
David was an avid fisherman, a die-
hard Cardinals fan. He had a talent for 
cooking and loved to entertain his 
friends and family. His vibrant person-
ality and remarkable smile will be 
missed. 
I really wish the best for his family 
right now. It is a sorrowful loss for 
them, but also everybody in our home-
town of Taylorville. Shannon and my 
kids send our thoughts and prayers to 
his wife, Debbie; his children, Mark and 
J.D.; his grandchildren, Libbey, Ben-
net, Jamison, Charlotte, and Connor; 
his parents, James and Mary; and his 
siblings, Linda and Tom. 
David, may you rest in peace, my 
friend. 
REMEMBERING ROSEMARIE LONG 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, it is a sad day today. Last 
night, not just my good friend, but a 
great friend to our community and 
Sangamon 
County, 
Illinois, 
passed 
away. 
Rosemarie Long was somebody who I 
came to know as the head of our local 
Republican Party in Springfield, Illi-
nois. I can tell you that Rose Long 
gave 
such 
good 
advice 
and 
great 
mentorship to many people like me and 
others who have walked this institu-
tion. Rose Long was somebody who 
cared about her community and cared 
about making her country better. 
My heart goes out to her family at 
this trying time, and I certainly want 
them to know that I know without 
Rose’s guidance, without Rose’s friend-
ship, without Rose’s support, I would 
not be blessed to serve as a Member of 
Congress. 
One thing about Rose, she was not 
shy, at all, of letting me know her con-
cerns about what we may or may not 
be doing right for her in this institu-
tion. I cannot believe that Rose is 
gone. I cannot believe that the world is 
going to be a better place without her. 
But I know one place that will be bet-
ter with her, and that is Heaven. 
Good luck, my friend. May you rest 
in peace, and may God continue to 
bless you and your family at this very 
sorrowful time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Holy God, we humble ourselves be-
fore You, coming to You in prayer as 
thousands across the globe and hun-
dreds within this Congress have done 
on this day of the National Prayer 
Breakfast. We pause to lay before You 
ourselves, our hopes, our dreams, our 
frustrations, and our anger, keenly 
aware of Your sovereignty over our 
lives, and our failures in living them. 
Even as we kneel before You, anoint 
us with Your mercy and lift up our 
eyes to Your grace. Shine Your re-
demptive light on us that we reflect 
the love that You have shown to us 
that our attitudes toward each other 
and to the tasks You set before us 
would be changed to demonstrate the 
benevolent plan You desire to share 
with each one and with this country. 
As Your people, holy and dearly 
loved, we commit to clothe ourselves 
with compassion, kindness, humility, 
gentleness and patience. Forgiven by 
Your mercy, we devote ourselves to 
bear with one another and to forgive 
the grievances we have against an-
other. 
So transformed, may we live lives of 
reconciliation, not as a political posi-
tion but in a posture of compassion. 
And with these virtues we will choose 
this day to love, that we would be 
bound together in perfect unity by the 
strength of Your most holy name in 
which we pray. 
Amen.

MEDICAL EDUCATION IN RURAL 
DISTRICTS 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about the urgent need to 
address doctor shortages in rural and 
medically 
underserved 
communities 
throughout our country. The current 
pandemic and problems with vaccine 
distribution have highlighted the dan-
gers behind a lack of access to the 
quality of healthcare in these areas. I 
am working to change that right now. 
Unlike producing personal protective 
equipment, it takes years to train a 
physician. This week, I will introduce 
legislation to invest in medical edu-
cation and to create new medical 
schools throughout this country and in 
underserved communities like mine in 
the San Joaquin Valley. 
This bill will help curb the shortfall 
of physicians in rural areas by enabling 
medical students to stay close to home. 
Studies increasingly show that stu-
dents who can study close to home are 
more likely to stay there and practice 
there upon graduation. 
If we want to keep the promise that 
every American who wants a vaccine 
will get one, then we need to have more 
doctors, nurses, and medical providers 
throughout our country. This legisla-
tion would do just that. 
Helping my constituents and keeping 
them safe is my number one priority. I 
will continue to do whatever it takes 
to make that happen. This is impor-
tant legislation, and I ask my col-
leagues to support this legislation in a 
bipartisan basis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H336 
February 4, 2021 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, in 
the midst of these hard times, we are 
especially grateful for the healthcare 
and frontline workers who have brave-
ly answered the call. Thankfully, we 
see glimmers of hope with the dis-
covery and distribution of multiple 
vaccines. 
Yet, sadly, here in Congress, Demo-
crats are using the pretense of COVID 
relief to ignore bipartisan consensus 
and push a $2 trillion liberal wish list 
of unrelated provisions. Let’s not for-
get the most recent targeted COVID re-
lief bill was signed into law only 1 
month ago, and together with pre-
viously enacted stimulus laws, over $1 
trillion remain unspent. 
Back home in Michigan, Governor 
Whitmer continues to go it alone, im-
posing punitive and arbitrary restric-
tions that have harmed too many small 
businesses and hardworking families. 
It is time to work together to end 
this pandemic and help our constitu-
ents get back on their feet. Let’s get 
students back in the classroom, vac-
cines distributed, and workers back on 
the job.

HONORING DAVID SNIDER 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in honor of David Snider, a 
constituent, a colleague, and a friend 
who passed away late last month. In 
every role, he dedicated himself self-
lessly and tirelessly to his community. 
I was honored to spend years working 
together on our State’s water con-
servation 
and 
management 
issues. 
Water is the lifeblood of the South-
west, and David helped ensure that 
families across our great State had ac-
cess to clean drinking water. 
David wore many hats, but the one 
that jumps out is his two terms as 
Pinal County Supervisor. His efforts 
helped to keep Arizona on track during 
the drought that still exists, and his 
plans and expertise have helped us 
form 
important 
multi-State 
water 
agreements. 
I know David’s legacy will live on. 
My heart is with the Snider family and 
the entire Casa Grande community as 
we mourn his passing.

CONGRATULATIONS TO ORION 
SAMUELSON ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Orion Samuelson 
on his retirement and to thank him for 
his 60 years of work at WGN Radio and 
Nexstar Media. 
Orion’s Hall of Fame career leaves 
behind a legacy known throughout the 
country, especially in our agriculture 
community in central and west central 
Illinois. 
Born on a dairy farm in La Crosse, 
Wisconsin, Orion got his start in radio 
in Appleton and Green Bay. In 1960, he 
came to Chicago and joined WGN Radio 
as their farm director. In the six dec-
ades since, Orion has become the best 
known voice in agriculture radio. From 
presenting his signature farm reports 
to anchoring ‘‘The Noon Show’’ and 
hosting his ‘‘U.S. Farm Report,’’ which 
still airs today, Orion is a legend in 
broadcasting and agriculture. In 1963, 
Orion was the first to read the on-air 
bulletin that President Kennedy had 
been assassinated in Dallas. 
His booming and distinctive voice is 
known well throughout Illinois and in 
our agriculture community. We will 
miss hearing his voice on air, seeing 
him at the Illinois State Fair in 
Springfield, and hearing his reports 
that helped guide our farmers to suc-
cess over the years. 
I want to thank Orion for his years of 
work and service, and I hope he enjoys 
a well-earned retirement.

THE BIG LIE 
(Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
attended more police officers’ funerals 
than I care to admit. Some I have eulo-
gized. The services are beautiful, but 
the loss is tremendous. 
Officer Sicknick’s murder hit us 
hard. It hit me hard for a lot of rea-
sons. But this death should be personal 
to every Member of Congress because I 
believe this body failed our Capitol Po-
lice officers. We tell everybody else 
that, if you see something, say some-
thing. Yet, while Brian was being mur-
dered and other officers were suffering 
great bodily harm, a significant num-
ber of Members in this body said noth-
ing and continued to uphold the big lie. 
They followed the unlawful, inhumane, 
and criminal orders of their Com-
mander in Chief. 
But Brian remembered his oath. And 
if we want to honor his life, then all of 
us should follow his example. Many 
have given much, but Officer Brian 
Sicknick gave all. He paid the ultimate 
sacrifice, and we are forever grateful 
for a life well lived.

MINNESOTA’S VETERANS OF 
FOREIGN WARS 
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I introduce a resolution commemo-
rating the 100th anniversary of the De-
partment of Minnesota Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. 
The Minnesota VFW was founded on 
January 17, 1921, and, today, has over 
200 posts across the State and serves 
more than 32,000 veterans who fought 
for America honorably overseas, as 
well as an additional 21,000 auxiliary 
members, consisting of veterans’ fam-
ily members. 
The Minnesota VFW Century of Serv-
ice has helped strengthen the common 
bonds of our military heroes by im-
proving the quality of life for veterans 
and their families. The VFW provides a 
wide array of services to its members, 
including 
youth 
development 
and 
scholarships, national security advo-
cacy, legislative affairs, citizenship 
education, 
veterans’ 
fellowship 
re-
treats, and financial assistance for dis-
abled veterans. 
I am incredibly grateful to those at 
the Minnesota VFW who work tire-
lessly on behalf of our States’ veterans. 
Here is to another 100 more years. I ask 
Members to cosponsor my resolution.

ECONOMIC CRISIS 
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, a lot 
of people in this body are talking about 
jobs these days, and rightfully so. Our 
economy is in crisis. But what I want 
to do is urge everyone that when we 
talk about rebuilding this economy, we 
are talking about all of the issues that 
make for a successful economy, and 
that includes childcare and attention 
to our children. 
Like many industries during this 
pandemic, 
childcare 
is 
struggling. 
Many facilities can’t pay their bills 
due to reduced demand in services and 
increased costs to keep safe facilities 
for both children and staff. Many of us 
on both sides of the aisle have right-
fully celebrated the heroes of this pan-
demic: healthcare workers, frontline 
workers, and essential workers. And 
these are the very people who are using 
childcare right now and they are the 
ones who cannot work from home and, 
therefore, need enriching and safe 
places for their children to go while 
they literally save lives and provide for 
the American people. 
So I ask every Member who has spo-
ken so passionately about our heroes 
and about returning to normal life to 
move beyond those words and to take 
meaningful votes on legislation that 
will ensure access to equitable, high- 
quality childcare for infants, toddlers, 
preschoolers, and afterschool care chil-
dren alike all across this country.

EXECUTIVE ORDERS COMPROMISE 
OUR SECURITY 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
the first and most important job of the 
Federal Government is protecting its 
citizens. From day one, President 
Biden, who campaigned as the unifier 
in chief, has made record unilateral de-
cisions to compromise the security of 
our country and undermine the rights 
of the American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H337 
February 4, 2021 
In his flood of executive orders, 
President Biden has already stopped 
deportation, lifted travel restrictions 
from terrorist countries, halted border 
wall construction, empowered sanc-
tuary cities, weakened asylum poli-
cies—I am running out of breath, 
Madam Speaker. 
I welcome all freedom-loving and 
law-abiding citizens who want to make 
a better life for themselves in this 
country, but we must respect the sov-
ereignty of this country, we must re-
spect the rule of law, and we must al-
ways respect the American people’s 
safety first.

YOUTH MENTORING MONTH 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of Youth 
Mentoring Month, which we celebrate 
in January. 
Established in 2002, Youth Mentoring 
Month celebrates the powerful impact 
of mentoring relationships and raises 
awareness about the need for more car-
ing adults to become mentors in their 
communities. 
In 2006, I created a career develop-
ment and mentorship program at Con-
stitution High School in Philadelphia 
and, throughout the years, I have 
served as a mentor many times over. 
We often talk about mentoring in 
terms of the benefits to young people, 
but what surprises so many people 
about mentoring is the emotional sat-
isfaction and benefits to the mentor. 
Whether it be through a classroom, an 
arts program, or a local youth sports 
team, mentors provide young people 
with the guidance and encouragement 
they need to find success and reach 
their full potential. 
As co-chair of the bipartisan Con-
gressional Youth Mentoring Caucus 
with Representative JAIME
HERRERA 
BEUTLER, I look forward to celebrating 
and promoting mentoring programs 
across our country.

CHINA CONTINUES TO SEEK 
GENETIC TECHNOLOGY 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, today I would like to 
bring attention to a troubling assess-
ment that was issued by the National 
Counterintelligence and Security Cen-
ter on Monday. 
China continues to aggressively seek 
to acquire Americans’ genetic informa-
tion. They have targeted American ho-
tels. They have targeted government 
agencies, as well as our universities, 
through hacks and ill-intentioned part-
nerships. They recently even tried to 
buy fertility clinics in the United 
States to gather American DNA. 
And as was catalogued on ‘‘60 Min-
utes’’ last week, the Chinese are now 
targeting family research databases 
that Americans innocently use to re-
search their family trees. 
Make no mistake, our healthcare in-
formation can be and will be used 
against us. The Chinese have already 
demonstrated the lengths to which 
they are willing to go to use genetics 
against their own people as they exper-
iment on the Uighurs in the Xinjiang 
province. This threat cannot be ig-
nored. 
China has already received person-
ally identifying information on most 
Americans. As citizens, we must take 
better control of our information, and 
Congress must act to keep this problem 
from getting worse.

RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF 
THE GREENSBORO FOUR 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, on 
February 1, 1960, four young Black men 
sat down at a Whites only Woolworth’s 
lunch counter in Greensboro, North 
Carolina, and asked to be served. These 
students from North Carolina A&T 
State University had trained for weeks 
to be able to withstand the hostility 
and abuse that would be thrust upon 
them. 
The next day, the ‘‘Greensboro Four’’ 
were joined by women from Bennett 
College and Greensboro Woman’s Col-
lege. The courage demonstrated by 
these students sparked a national sit- 
in movement that spread to 55 cities in 
13 States. The sit-ins lasted for 6 
months until, finally, the Woolworth’s 
lunch counter was integrated. 
As the Representative from Greens-
boro, I join my colleagues, Representa-
tives ADAMS and BUTTERFIELD, in in-
troducing a resolution to recognize the 
legacy of the Greensboro Four, and fol-
low their lead in fighting for a future 
that will bring equal rights to all peo-
ple.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
JOSHUA GRANT 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the 
service of the Correspondence Director 
of the Second Congressional District, 
Joshua Grant. This week he is joining 
the office of my fellow Charlestonian, 
Senator TIM SCOTT, as a Legislative 
Correspondent for Finance. 
Josh hails from the beautiful commu-
nity of Walterboro, South Carolina, 
and joined the office of the Second Dis-
trict shortly after graduating from 
Benedict College, an historically Black 
college in Columbia, in 2016. During his 
time in the office, Josh continually 
went above and beyond and made every 
constituent and guest feel welcome. He 
instituted a small-town sense of com-
munity to Capitol Hill. 
Congratulations to his parents, Jo-
seph and Diannia Grant, as well as his 
siblings, Tahnee Johnson, Tiffany Gist, 
Lisa Grant, and Jason Grant, for rais-
ing a kind, smart, and inspired young 
man, a favorite of my wife, Roxanne. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
After last night, Republicans are 
united to stop socialism which destroys 
jobs.

EXECUTIVE ORDER ON KEYSTONE 
PIPELINE 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
opposition 
to 
President 
Biden’s executive order to revoke the 
permit for the Keystone pipeline. 
This decision was political, provides 
no benefit to the environment, and it 
came at a cost of approximately 11,000 
good-paying American jobs. 
President Biden cited concerns re-
garding climate change for his reason 
on stopping the pipeline. But under 
President Obama and Vice President 
Joe Biden, the State Department con-
ducted a review and found the pipeline 
to have minimal impact on the envi-
ronment. 
Now, instead of having the pipeline, 
the oil from Canada will now be trans-
ported in less safe ways like trucks and 
railways. 
Axing the Keystone pipeline de-
stroyed thousands of jobs, won’t reduce 
the greenhouse gas emissions, and only 
will deepen the divide on the issue of 
climate change.

CONDEMNING ABORTION 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
our wonderful country, America, has 
been given material wealth beyond be-
lief, plus natural beauty that I think is 
greater than anything around the 
world. 
In 1973, how did this country respond 
to those gifts? The United States Su-
preme Court, in Roe v. Wade, legalized 
abortion, something that even in days 
before the ultrasound, almost was uni-
versally condemned around the world. 
Since that time, 62 million unborn ba-
bies have had their lives cut short in 
America. 
The United States is one of only 
seven countries in the world where 
late-term abortions are legal, joining 
countries like China, North Korea, 
Vietnam, and then Singapore, Canada, 
and Holland. 
Now, we, under the current adminis-
tration, look to push for still more

abortions by talking about removing 
the Hyde amendment allowing for tax-
payer funding and, even worse, repeal-
ing the new Mexico City policy in 
which the United States gives money 
to organizations abroad who will wind 
up performing abortions. That is what 
the United States will become known 
for around the world. 
How is this to respond to the natural 
wealth and beauty we have been given.

RECOGNIZING 
INDIANA 
COUNTY, 
PENNSYLVANIA’S 
MEALS 
ON 
WHEELS 50-YEAR MILESTONE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the Meals on Wheels Program in 
Indiana County, Pennsylvania, who re-
cently celebrated a 50-year milestone 
of helping neighbors in need. 
Marty Yachisko is the lifeblood of 
this operation. Marty has been running 
the Meals on Wheels Program in Indi-
ana County out of the local American 
Legion kitchen since 1981. Five days a 
week, Marty and his volunteers gather 
at the Legion to prepare meals for 
local senior citizens. Currently, Meals 
on Wheels of Indiana County is serving 
35 seniors but, in the past, volunteers 
have served up to 70 individuals daily. 
Before COVID–19, almost 10 million 
seniors were facing hunger threats. 
Meals on Wheels provides an incredibly 
valuable service. It is not just hot 
meals. For many seniors, their only so-
cial interaction of the day may be their 
visit from a Meals on Wheels volunteer. 
That connection is invaluable. 
Meals on Wheels Indiana is always 
looking for more volunteers looking to 
help seniors in their community. 
Thank you to Marty and the team at 
Meals on Wheels Indiana County for 
their dedication.

CELEBRATING LUNAR NEW YEAR 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and

Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to join my com-
munity in recognizing and celebrating 
the Lunar New Year. 
2021 is the Year of the Ox, which rep-
resents strength, determination, and 
perseverance. 
We have seen this spirit in the Amer-
ican people during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. And while we have faced un-
precedented challenges, we have also 
shown that the American people are re-
silient. And I hope this year, this new 
year is filled with many blessings, joy, 
and renewal. I pray that this year 
brings success and happiness to all. 
I hope to be a voice for our commu-
nity to ensure that the American 
Dream that I was able to achieve is 
available for everyone and for our next 
generation. Together, I know we can 
make a better world. 
I would like to extend a happy new 
year to everyone.

made in Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese,

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H. RES. 72, REMOVING A CER-
TAIN MEMBER FROM CERTAIN 
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 91 and ask for 
its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 91 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order without interven-
tion of any point of order to consider in the 
House the resolution (H. Res. 72) removing a 
certain Member from certain standing com-
mittees of the House of Representatives. The 
resolution shall be considered as read. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the resolution and preamble to 
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question except one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Ethics. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, the Rules Committee met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
91, to provide for the consideration of 
H. Res. 72, removing a certain Member 
from certain standing committees of 
the House of Representatives under a 
closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the Chair and ranking member of 
the Committee on Ethics. 
Madam Speaker, this is one of those 
moments where this institution must 
decide where the line is drawn. 
A person in this House encouraged vi-
olence against Members of this institu-
tion, part of a larger pattern of dis-
turbing rhetoric. 
She has also called the Sandy Hook 
and Parkland shootings, where young 
children were killed, a hoax. 
She followed and harassed a survivor 
of the Parkland shooting, David Hogg. 
She promoted a video featuring a 
Holocaust denier which contained dis-
gusting anti-Semitic language. 
She has even claimed that 9/11 was a 
hoax; that a plane didn’t really hit the 
Pentagon. 
And what did our distinguished mi-
nority leader, KEVIN
MCCARTHY
do, 
Madam Speaker? 
Did he take action to push this dis-
gusting rhetoric out of the Republican 
conference? 
No, 
he 
rewarded 
Congresswoman 
GREENE with seats on the Education 
and Labor and Budget Committees. 
Now, I don’t get surprised by much 
around here these days, but I was 
shocked by this. 
Our teachers and our students are 
watching, Madam Speaker. Two of 
them are my sisters, who are public 
school teachers in Massachusetts. I 
can’t imagine how they feel knowing 
that someone who says the deadliest 
high school shooting in our Nation’s 
history was a false flag operation; how 
they will feel if that person sits behind 
the dais of the Education and Labor 
Committee, or behind the dais of any 
committee. 
Madam Speaker, serving on a com-
mittee is not a right, it is a privilege, 
and when someone encourages violence 
against a Member, they should lose 
that privilege. 
Now, this is not a radical idea. When 
something like this happened in the 
past, party leadership on both sides 
stepped up and took action. 
That is what happened with Demo-
crat Bill Jefferson and Republican 
Steve King. We are here today because 
Minority Leader MCCARTHY does not 
have the courage to do what is right. 
Now, I remember a time when Repub-
lican leaders had the courage to do 
what was right. Dealing with the likes 
of Steve King was not an isolated inci-
dent. In 1991, when the Republican 
Party contended with David Duke, a 
Holocaust-denying neo-Nazi and former 
KKK grand wizard, former President 
George H.W. Bush said: ‘‘He should be 
rejected for what he is and what he 
stands for.’’ 
David Duke was pushed out of the 
party and stripped of any credibility 
and recognition. 
b 1230 
Even as recently as 2016, when Duke 
announced a run for the U.S. Senate, 
the then-Republican National Com-
mittee chairman said: ‘‘David Duke 
and his hateful bigotry have no place 
in the Republican Party.’’ 
Madam Speaker, that seems like for-
ever ago. What happened? The party of 
Lincoln is becoming the party of vio-
lent conspiracy theories. And appar-
ently, the leaders of the Republican

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H339 
February 4, 2021 
Party in the House today are not going 
to do a damn thing about it. 
Now, I never thought I would say 
this, Madam Speaker, but I agree with 
MITCH MCCONNELL. The Senate minor-
ity leader this week called Congress-
woman 
GREENE’s 
embrace 
of 
con-
spiracy theories ‘‘a cancer for the Re-
publican Party.’’ 
I would take it a step further. I think 
giving Congresswoman GREENE a mega-
phone on a standing committee would 
be a cancer on this entire Congress. 
None of us get to decide who the vot-
ers send to Congress. But as Members 
of this body, it is our job to set the 
standard for the conduct of those who 
serve here, especially when they cross 
the line into violence. 
The Republican talking point now 
seems to be: ‘‘I condemn Congress-
woman GREENE’s words, but . . . ‘’ 
Madam Speaker, her words are inde-
fensible, period. And we must act, not 
because it helps us or hurts them, but 
because it is the right thing to do for 
this institution and for America. 
Is nothing beyond the pale? Is there 
nothing so depraved and so disgusting 
that my colleagues would not condemn 
it, not just with words but with action? 
Will they not draw the line at calling 
for the assassination of another Mem-
ber of this body? 
It is my understanding that Con-
gresswoman GREENE
got a standing 
ovation from many Members during 
their Conference meeting last night. 
Come on. 
Who applauded the person who advo-
cated putting a bullet in the head of 
the Speaker of House? Who applauded 
the person who said school shootings 
are a false flag operation? Who ap-
plauded the person who suggested that 
9/11 was a hoax? 
I would like to know. I would like to 
know exactly who on the other side be-
lieves that these sick ideas deserve a 
standing ovation. Could we see a show 
of hands, please? 
When the history books are written, 
they will remember this moment. But 
more than that, we all have to live 
with ourselves. I could never live with 
myself if I did nothing here. This is not 
the time for any of us to just look the 
other way. 
Now, I am actually hopeful that 
there are some Republican Members 
who are willing to stand up, join with 
us, and vote for this resolution because 
it is the right thing to do, partisanship 
be damned. 
I challenge any one of my colleagues 
to take a moment and read what she 
has said and what she has posted and 
come down here and try to defend it. 
You can’t. It is indefensible. 
Congresswoman GREENE
says this 
resolution could set a precedent for the 
future. I hope it does. Because if this 
isn’t the bottom, then I don’t know 
what the hell is. 
I hope we are setting a clear standard 
for what we will not tolerate. Anyone 
who suggests putting a bullet in the 
head of a Member shouldn’t serve on 
any committee, period. 
This is the standard that we are set-
ting here today, and I am betting it is 
a standard that the American people 
want us to uphold. This is where we 
draw the line, Madam Speaker. These 
words and actions are the worst I think 
I have ever seen, ever, in all my time 
here. 
We should have the courage to pass 
this rule and the underlying resolution 
on a bipartisan basis, to stand up for 
what is right, to demand better from 
those who serve in this institution, and 
to demand more for the people that we 
represent. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts, my good friend, Chairman 
MCGOVERN, for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today is a sad one 
for us, for me personally, for the Rules 
Committee, and for the entire House of 
Representatives. Today, we are meet-
ing on an unprecedented resolution by 
the majority, removing a Member of 
the minority party from her committee 
assignments. 
Now, 
before 
I 
continue, 
Madam 
Speaker, I want to be very clear that I 
find the comments made by the Rep-
resentative in question before she was 
elected to Congress to be deeply offen-
sive. Members of Congress are and 
should be held to a high standard. And 
if she spoke any of what has been re-
ported while a Member of this body, 
her words would certainly not meet 
that standard. 
But at last night’s Republican Con-
ference, Representative GREENE
ex-
pressed regret for her past statements, 
which speaks to a problem with today’s 
resolution. Representative GREENE is 
not being given the courtesy of a refer-
ral to the Ethics Committee, the body 
empowered to investigate the conduct 
of Members. She is not being given the 
same due process that is given to other 
Members before facing punishment by 
the House. 
Why is it so hard for the majority to 
give a Republican Member due process 
before stripping her of her committees? 
That is all I asked the Rules Com-
mittee last night, which the majority 
rejected. 
Today’s 
resolution 
raises 
serious 
questions for this institution. Indeed, 
these questions have nothing to do 
with this particular Member at all. In-
stead, they are about the future of the 
institution. The action the majority is 
proposing to take today is not only 
premature but, in fact, unprecedented 
in the history of the House. 
Madam Speaker, what the majority 
is really proposing to do today is estab-
lish a new standard for punishing Mem-
bers for conduct before they ever be-
came a Member. The majority is pro-
posing to hold Members of Congress ac-
countable for statements made before 
they were even a candidate for Con-
gress. 
This change opens up troubling ques-
tions about how we judge future Mem-
bers of Congress and whether or not we, 
as an institution, should impose sanc-
tions on Members for actions they took 
before they were even candidates for 
office. 
Under this majority’s new approach, 
could a Member be punished for state-
ments they made 5 years ago? Ten 
years ago? Twenty years ago? 
I would remind the majority that 
several of their own Members have en-
gaged in activities or made comments 
that Republican Members find offen-
sive and inappropriate. If the majority 
changes hands in the future, as it sure-
ly will at some point, how would the 
current majority feel if these Members 
are stripped of their committee assign-
ments with no due process? My friends 
run the risk of setting off a tit-for-tat 
exchange of escalating partisan punish-
ment and score-settling that could 
cripple the operation of the House now 
and well into the future. 
But what has also never been done 
before in the history of the institution 
is this: The majority has never taken 
steps to exercise a veto over the mi-
nority’s committee assignments. It has 
never been done, Madam Speaker. 
I know my friend, Chairman MCGOV-
ERN, attempted to point out some cases 
in yesterday’s Rules Committee hear-
ing to the contrary. But each of those 
cases he cited actually involved the 
party sanctioning their own Members. 
The majority exercising a veto over the 
minority’s assignments has never hap-
pened before. 
I would also like to point out that 
this is the same majority which raised 
no objections a week ago when this 
House unanimously approved resolu-
tions on committee assignments. 
In the past, the majority and minor-
ity have respected each other’s rights 
to place Members on committees with-
out interference. It has ultimately 
been the responsibility of each side to 
also hold their Members accountable 
for unacceptable behavior, including 
making decisions to remove Members 
from 
their 
committee 
assignments 
when warranted. 
Indeed, Madam Speaker, Republicans 
have removed Members from commit-
tees in the past. I know. I have person-
ally been part of those proceedings. 
We can and will do so again, if nec-
essary, but it will be done with due 
process and with the Members in ques-
tion, whoever they may be, allowed to 
make their case. That is a simple 
standard of fair play and decency that 
the majority has decided not to extend 
to a Member of the minority in this 
case. 
I truly believe that the majority 
claiming a new right to be able to exer-
cise a veto over the minority’s com-
mittee assignments will ultimately be 
dangerous 
for 
this

holds a veto power over everything, in-
cluding committee assignments, is ul-
timately an institution that cannot 
function. 
If one side feels the other should take 
corrective action for one of its Mem-
bers and has failed to do so, then the 
bipartisan Ethics Committee exists to 
adjudicate matters related to the Code 
of Official Conduct. I believe it would 
be appropriate for the Ethics Com-
mittee to determine if a new standard 
relating to the actions taken by a 
Member of Congress before they are 
elected should be covered by the Code 
of Official Conduct and make the ap-
propriate recommendations for the in-
stitution to guide us going forward. 
I fear that doing anything other than 
this would send the institution down a 
precarious path. The Ethics Committee 
is the appropriate venue for consid-
ering claims of misconduct. That is 
traditionally what this institution has 
done when considering the conduct of 
an individual Member. I believe today 
it is appropriate to adhere to that 
norm. 
Madam Speaker, the matter we are 
faced with is bigger than any one indi-
vidual Member. It is about how we, as 
an institution, will continue to func-
tion in the future. I fear that if we 
open this particular Pandora’s box, we 
will not like what happens next. I 
would strongly urge this House to con-
sider an alternative course before it is 
too late. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I will respond to a 
couple of things my good friend, Mr. 
COLE, just said. 
As he pointed out, in the past, Mem-
bers were removed from committees as 
a result of the wishes of their party 
leaders. It did not go through the Eth-
ics Committee. 
The reason we are here is because, in 
this case, which seems very obvious to 
us, the Republican leadership chose not 
to act. In fact, they met last night, and 
they voted on whether to remove Con-
gresswoman CHENEY from her position 
because she had the courage of her con-
victions and came down and voted her 
conscience. They didn’t vote on this. 
Again, let me also point out, with re-
gard to the Ethics Committee, there is 
no Ethics Committee that exists quite 
yet because Republicans haven’t ap-
pointed all of their Members to the 
Ethics Committee, so it doesn’t even 
function at this particular point. 
I would just also say that, listening 
to my good friend, he talks about all of 
this as if it is somehow ancient his-
tory. Well, the gentlewoman from 
Georgia, as we speak, continues to 
fundraise off these disturbing remarks. 
I am not sure what she said to the 
Republican Conference last night, but 
just last night, she tweeted about rais-
ing $175,000 off of this and said: ‘‘We 
will not back down. We will never give 
up.’’ 
That 
is 
not 
contrition, 
Madam 
Speaker. I say that to my colleagues. 
That is doubling down and profiting. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), a member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I, 
too, have to agree with the ranking 
member of the Rules Committee that 
this does raise serious questions for our 
institution and assure him that this is 
not a move taken lightly, but our col-
leagues have left us no choice. 
Historically, the parties have policed 
themselves. Even as recently as 2 years 
ago, our Republican colleagues re-
moved a Member from committees 
after he made a series of false and des-
picable statements, which were less se-
rious than the conduct we consider 
here. 
But, apparently, that was the old 
GOP. In the words of Republican Sen-
ator JOHN THUNE from South Dakota, 
the party of ‘‘limited government and 
fiscal 
responsibility, 
free 
markets, 
peace through strength’’ has become 
the ‘‘party of conspiracy theories and 
QAnon.’’ 
No matter how much our colleagues 
here today say that they disapprove of 
the conduct of the Representative from 
Georgia, they must realize that she is 
now the face of their party. 
If today’s House Republican caucus 
wants to embrace this behavior, the 
majority does not. The Member in 
question has advocated for insurrection 
and violence against elected officials 
and children, has challenged the safety 
of Members and our Capitol Police, and 
has promoted fringe conspiracy theo-
ries that damage our work. 
Such behavior would not be tolerated 
in any other workplace, and it cannot 
be tolerated in the people’s House. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle know this. While they have 
been careful to distance themselves 
from their Member’s remarks and ac-
tions, they have not shown the courage 
to hold a Member of their own party 
accountable when they don’t have the 
shield of a secret vote. 
They force us to take this action to 
stop the spread of conspiracy theories, 
lies, and hate in the Halls of Congress. 
This isn’t canceling the Representa-
tive from Georgia’s voice. It is about 
accountability. There is no right to 
committee assignments, but if a Mem-
ber conducts himself or herself in so 
disgraceful a way that she brings dis-
credit upon Congress, and her own 
party cannot address the problem, then 
the House, as a whole, has to deal with 
it. 
I urge my colleagues to recognize 
what the public has recognized in a bi-
partisan manner, that the indecent be-
havior of this Member is a threat to 
Congress and our government. 
b 1245 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume 
just for informational purposes. 
There is no way my friend from Mas-
sachusetts could have known this, but 
last night the Republican members 
were formally named to the Ethics 
Committee. We expect them to be ap-
proved today so the committee could 
function immediately. But, again, my 
friend would have had no way of know-
ing that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, to my Democrat colleagues, 
to my Republican colleagues, to my 
district back home in Georgia 14, to 
the American people, to my mom and 
dad, and to my husband and my chil-
dren: 
I have been here for 1 month and 1 
day, and I have gotten to know part of 
my conference—my Republican col-
leagues—but not even all of them yet. 
I haven’t gotten to know any of my 
Democrat colleagues, and I haven’t had 
any conversations with any of you to 
tell you who I am and what I am about. 
You only know me by how Media Mat-
ters, CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of the 
mainstream media is portraying me. 
What you don’t know about me is 
that I am a very proud wife of almost 
25 years and that I am a mother of 
three children. I consider being a moth-
er the greatest blessing of my life and 
the greatest thing that I will ever 
achieve. I am proudly the first person 
to graduate college in my family, mak-
ing my parents very happy and proud. 
I 
am 
also 
a 
very 
successful 
businessowner. We have grown our 
company from one State to 11 States. I 
am a very hard worker. I have always 
paid my taxes. I have never been ar-
rested. I have never done drugs. But I 
have gotten a few speeding tickets in 
my day. 
What you need to know about me is 
I am a very regular American, just like 
the people I represent in my district 
and most people across the country. I 
never, ever considered to run for Con-
gress or even get involved in politics. 
As a matter of fact, I wasn’t a political 
person until I found a candidate that I 
really liked, and his name is Donald J. 
Trump, when he ran for President. 
To me, he was someone I could relate 
to, someone that I enjoyed his plain 
talk; not the offensive things, but just 
the way he talked normally. And I 
thought, finally, maybe this is some-
one who will do something about the 
things that deeply bother me, like the 
fact that we are so deeply in debt, that 
our country has murdered over 62 mil-
lion people in the womb, that our bor-
ders are open and some of my friends 
have had their children murdered by il-
legal aliens. Or perhaps that maybe we 
can stop sending our sons and daugh-
ters to fight in foreign wars and be 
used as the world’s police basically. Or 
maybe that our Government would 
stand up for our American businesses 
and our American jobs and make the 
American people and the American 
taxpayers their focus. These are the 
things that I care about deeply.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H341 
February 4, 2021 
So when we elected President Trump, 
and then I started seeing things in the 
news that didn’t make sense to me— 
like Russian collusion, which are con-
spiracy theories also and have been 
proven so—these things bothered me 
deeply. I realized that just watching 
CNN or FOX News, I may not find the 
truth. 
So what I did was I started looking 
up things on the internet, asking ques-
tions, like most people do every day, 
use Google. I stumbled across some-
thing—and this was at the end of 2017— 
called QAnon. Well, these posts were 
mainly about this Russian collusion in-
formation. A lot of it was some of what 
I would see on the news at night, and I 
got very interested in it. So I posted 
about it on Facebook, I read about it, 
I talked about it, I asked questions 
about it. And then more information 
came from it. 
But, you see, here’s the problem: 
Throughout 2018, I was upset about 
things and didn’t trust the Government 
really because the people here weren’t 
doing the things that I thought they 
should be doing for us, the things that 
I just told you I cared about. And I 
want you to know that a lot of Ameri-
cans don’t trust our Government, and 
that is sad. The problem with that is, 
though, I was allowed to believe things 
that weren’t true, and I would ask 
questions about them and talk about 
them. 
And that is absolutely what I regret 
because, if it weren’t for the Facebook 
posts and comments that I liked in 
2018, I wouldn’t be standing here today 
and you couldn’t point a finger and ac-
cuse me of anything wrong, because I 
have lived a very good life that I am 
proud of, my family is proud of, my 
husband is proud of, my children are 
proud of. And that is what my district 
elected me for. 
So later in 2018, when I started find-
ing misinformation, lies, things that 
were not true in these QAnon posts, I 
stopped believing it. And I want to tell 
you—and I say this to everyone—any 
source of information that is a mix of 
truth and a mix of lies is dangerous, no 
matter what it is saying, what party it 
is helping, anything, or any country it 
is about. It is dangerous. And these are 
the things that happen on the left and 
the right. And it is a true problem in 
our country. 
So I walked away from those things 
and I decided that I am going to do 
what I have done all my life: I am 
going to work hard and try to solve the 
problems that I am upset about. So I 
started getting involved in politics. 
You see, school shootings are abso-
lutely real. Every child that is lost, 
those families mourn it. I understand 
how terrible it is because when I was 16 
years old, in 11th grade, my school was 
a gun-free school zone, and one of my 
schoolmates brought guns to school 
and took our entire school hostage, and 
that happened right down the hall from 
my classroom. I know the fear that 
David Hogg had that day. I know the 
fear that these kids have. And I say 
this sincerely with all my heart be-
cause I love our kids, every single one 
of your children, all of our children: 
This is why I truly believe that chil-
dren at school should never be left un-
protected. I believe they should be just 
as protected as we were with 30,000 Na-
tional Guardsmen. Our children are our 
future and they are our most precious 
resource. 
I also want to tell you that 9/11 abso-
lutely happened. I remember that day, 
crying all day long, watching it on the 
news. And it is a tragedy for anyone to 
say it didn’t happen. So I definitely 
want to tell you that I do not believe 
that it is fake. 
I also want to tell you that we have 
to do better. You see, big media compa-
nies can take teeny tiny pieces of 
words that I have said, that you have 
said, any of us have said, and can por-
tray us into someone that we are not, 
and that is wrong. 
Cancel culture is a real thing. It is 
very real. And with big tech companies 
like Twitter, you can scroll through 
and see where someone may have 
retweeted porn. This is a problem. This 
is a terrible, terrible thing. Yet when I 
say that I absolutely believe with all 
my heart that God’s creation is he cre-
ated the male and female and that 
should not be denied, when I am 
censored for saying those type of 
things, that is wrong. 
You see, here’s the real situation: I 
decided to run for Congress because I 
wanted to help our country. I want 
Americans 
to 
have 
our 
American 
Dream. I want to protect our freedoms. 
This is what I ran for Congress on. 
I never once said QAnon during my 
entire campaign. I never once said dur-
ing my campaign any of the things 
that I am being accused of today. I 
never said any of these things since I 
have been elected for Congress. These 
were words of the past. These things do 
not represent me. They do not rep-
resent my district. They do not rep-
resent my values. 
Here’s what I can tell you: I am be-
yond grateful for this opportunity. And 
I will tell you why. I believe in God 
with all my heart. I am so grateful to 
be humbled, to be reminded that I am 
a sinner and that Jesus died on the 
cross to forgive me for my sins. This is 
something that I absolutely rejoice in 
today to tell you all. I think it is im-
portant for all of us to remember that 
none of us are perfect. None of us are. 
None of us can even come close to earn-
ing our way into Heaven just by our 
acts and our works, but it is only 
through the grace of God. 
This is why I will tell you as a Mem-
ber of this Congress—the 117th Con-
gress: I am a passionate person. I am a 
competitor. I am a fighter. I will work 
with you for good things for the people 
of this country. 
But the things I will not stand for is 
abortion. I think it is the worst thing 
this country has ever committed. And 
if we are to say, ‘‘In God we trust,’’ 
how do we murder God’s creation in 
the womb? 
Another thing I will say to this body 
is I want to work with all of you for 
our people. It should be America first 
always. 
Always. 
There 
is 
nothing 
wrong with that. 
If this Congress is to tolerate Mem-
bers that condone riots that have hurt 
American people, attacked police offi-
cers, occupied Federal property, burned 
businesses and cities, yet wants to con-
demn me and crucify me in the public 
square for words that I said—and I re-
gret—a few years ago, then I think we 
are in a real big problem, a very big 
problem. 
What shall we do as Americans? 
Shall we stay divided like this? Will we 
allow the media, that is just as guilty 
as QAnon of presenting truth and lies, 
to divide us? Will we allow ourselves to 
be addicted to hate and hating one an-
other? 
I hope not, because that is not the fu-
ture I want for my children and it is 
not the future I want for any of your 
children. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. First of all, Madam 
Speaker, to equate the media to QAnon 
is beyond the pale. 
Secondly, the gentlewoman said that 
she now believes that 9/11 really hap-
pened. But let me just read a quote. At 
the conservative American Priority 
Conference, she said: ‘‘It’s odd there’s 
never any evidence shown for a plane 
in 
the 
Pentagon, 
but 
anyways, 
I 
won’t—I won’t—I’m not going to dive 
into the 9/11 conspiracy.’’ 
Now, granted, that was in 2018, and 
the gentlewoman just told us that, in 
2018, she had an epiphany and decided 
not to follow these conspiracy theories 
anymore. 
But then, in 2019, she claims that 
Speaker PELOSI is guilty of treason, 
and then she said: ‘‘It’s a crime punish-
able by death is what treason is. NANCY 
PELOSI is guilty of treason.’’ 
That is 2019. Also in 2019, she liked a 
comment on social media that advo-
cated a bullet to the head of Speaker 
PELOSI. 
Also in 2019, in an interview, she 
called a student survivor of the Park-
land massacre, ‘‘Very trained. He is 
like a dog.’’ And then she said that he 
was an idiot who only talked when he 
is scripted. 
Also in 2019, you know, on the 
Grounds of the Capitol complex, Rep-
resentative GREENE followed a survivor 
of the Parkland massacre, calling him 
a coward; and then when he ignored her 
shouted questions, she said: He can’t 
say a word because he can’t defend his 
stance. 
I mean, that is 2019. 
Now, we could be here all week going 
over comments and posts in 2019 and in 
2020. So, you know, I just have to say 
that I did not hear a disavowment or 
an apology for those things. I did not 
hear an apology or denouncement for 
the claim, the insinuation that polit-
ical opponents should be violently 
dealt with. I didn’t hear anybody

apologize or retract the anti-Semitic 
and Islamophobic remarks that have 
been made and that have been posted 
over and over and over again. Again, 
the gentlewoman’s campaign has prof-
ited off of these hurtful remarks and 
these dangerous statements. So I just 
point that out for the RECORD. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
AUSTIN 
SCOTT), my very good friend. 
b 1300 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, this morning, as 
many of you, I was watching the Na-
tional Day of Prayer. While watching, I 
was reading an opinion piece in Baptist 
News and this message stuck out to me 
as relevant to today’s debate: Whoever 
has the power, makes the rules; who-
ever makes the rules, makes them in 
their favor. 
Madam Speaker, I want you to know 
that I read that before I saw your pray-
er, which I thought was a wonderful 
closing prayer. 
I would point out, some others who 
don’t share our faith may not. I 
thought it was wonderful and that is 
the First Amendment that we get to 
enjoy in this country, and I thank you 
for that prayer. 
I rise today in opposition to H. Res. 
72 and efforts by the majority to re-
move a member of the minority party 
from their committee assignments. 
This resolution—and I think this is 
important—was introduced 3 days ago 
to the Ethics Committee, but it was 
brought to the floor without so much 
as a hearing before the Ethics Com-
mittee. 
Now I want to stress, the past re-
marks or emojis that you bring up of 
our colleague do not represent the val-
ues of our Conference nor of my home 
State of Georgia. I expressed that in 
her primary and I continue to express 
that today. 
But if this was about the remarks our 
colleague made, you would put a reso-
lution on the floor condemning those 
remarks. But no matter what those re-
marks are or how bad they are, she and 
every other Member in this body 
should be entitled to due process just 
as every other American is entitled to 
due process. And in this case, it would 
be before the Ethics Committee before 
it came to the floor of the House. 
But let’s be honest about what this 
is. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Georgia an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, you have a 10-vote 
margin in this body. This body has 20 
standing committees. You created a 
proxy voting system that allows your 
Members to stay at home while the Re-
publican Members show up for work 
and you have another resolution that 
you haven’t discussed yet to remove 
over 100 Republican Members of Con-
gress, including 6 from my home State 
of Georgia. 
Do you really think that we believe 
that you are going to stop with the 
gentlewoman from the 14th Congres-
sional District, Mrs. MARJORIE TAYLOR 
GREENE? We know better. We know bet-
ter. The truth of the matter is you 
have got a math problem in passing 
your agenda. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just tell my colleague from 
Georgia—I can’t resist because he men-
tioned proxy voting. I hate to tell him, 
but a lot of Republicans are voting by 
proxy, too. So the same ones who con-
demned it are the ones who are now 
utilizing it. 
And, again, I would remind the gen-
tleman that this is not a criminal trial. 
And that when the Republicans re-
moved Steve King from his commit-
tees, there was no Ethics Committee 
deliberation on that. The decision was 
made to remove Steve King because fi-
nally, at long last, there was a realiza-
tion that embracing white supremacy 
was unacceptable. 
When Bill Jefferson, a Democrat, was 
removed by Democrats, again, removed 
from his committees, there wasn’t an 
Ethics Committee deliberation. It was 
a decision that our leadership made 
and there was bipartisan support for 
that as well. 
Now, we can sit here all we want and 
try to make excuses for not taking ac-
tion. I mean, I think the standard here 
is, Republicans are coming to the floor 
and saying: We don’t want to associate 
ourselves with these remarks. We con-
demn these remarks, but we don’t ap-
preciate any references to violence, 
and we don’t appreciate any references 
to anti-Semitism, but . . . 
I mean, but, but, but, but. And here 
we are. 
And so the issue here is that the Re-
publican Conference last night met to 
really deliberate on the fate of Con-
gresswoman CHENEY. They didn’t take 
a vote on this. And, basically, by doing 
nothing, what does that message send? 
How refreshing it would be, how wel-
come it would be if there was a strong, 
bipartisan vote on this resolution. 
Imagine what that would mean to the 
American people to know that we were 
all unified on the issue of when a Mem-
ber, when a person who serves in this 
House has advocated the use of vio-
lence, called for assassinations, that we 
all agree that that is so unacceptable 
that, at a minimum, they ought not to 
have the privilege of being on a com-
mittee. 
And I am not sure we are going to get 
that kind of unity here today, but I 
hope we do. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, just 
quickly, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, just to respond to 
my friend briefly, remember, we are 
doing something here that has never 
been done before. The majority is tak-
ing away a committee assignment of 
the minority. That has not happened in 
this House before. 
Also remember, we are applying, or 
you were choosing to apply the code of 
official conduct to a Member before 
they were ever a Member. That has 
not, to my knowledge, ever been done 
before either. 
We haven’t said: Let’s do nothing. We 
have said: These are pretty serious 
questions. Let’s go to the Ethics Com-
mittee, adjudicate them, have a discus-
sion, and have a recommendation come 
back out. 
So to say we don’t want to do some-
thing is just simply inaccurate. I think 
you are, frankly, overlooking the un-
precedented nature of the acts that you 
have decided upon, and where that may 
lead us when the majority changes. 
So with that, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I find my-
self sort of the oldest freshman in my 
class returning after just a 2-year hia-
tus and finding a House that I am hav-
ing a hard time understanding how it 
got so bad in such a short period of 
time. 
As my colleague on the other side of 
the aisle aptly said, we have had to re-
move people for cause in this body. 
When I was a freshman some 20 years 
ago, we removed Jim Traficant because 
he had been tried and convicted and 
still wouldn’t resign. 
We have stripped people of their com-
mittees when they have been indicted 
and ensured that they left this body 
when they were convicted. 
But we have not and should not, in 
fact, hold people responsible for ac-
tions before the people of their home 
State elected them and their Secretary 
of State certified them, and they came 
here. In so doing, we could pick a 
plethora of people not to seat or not to 
give committees to. 
On the other side of the aisle, there is 
a gentleman who I respect whom I have 
served with for my entire time in Con-
gress who was impeached and removed 
from office by this very body and, yet, 
has served honorably here for more 
than two decades and sits at a high po-
sition on many committees. 
After the Civil War, in time, there 
were people who had been Confederate 
soldiers who came here as Congress-
men. In fact, the famous Senator Byrd 
was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan 
before he was a member of these bod-
ies. 
We cannot and should not judge peo-
ple by what they have done before they 
arrive, and we should not tell the mi-
nority who they can seat. You may 
shame us, you may disparage us if we 
give somebody a committee assign-
ment, but that is part of free speech.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H343 
February 4, 2021 
In closing, if we do this, it will be no 
different than when John Adams al-
lowed for a Member—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of 
the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from California an addi-
tional 15 seconds. 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, when a 
member of this body was incarcerated 
for something that John Adams felt 
was injurious to him under the Sedi-
tion Act, it was retroactive. He had 
written it before the act was passed 
and the act was, in fact, not in keeping 
with our free speech. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me, again, just respond by re-
minding the gentleman that this isn’t 
an issue because of political differences 
on policy. It just isn’t. 
I mean, I remind him, Representative 
GREENE, in January 2019 on her social 
media, liked a comment that advo-
cated a bullet to the head of the Speak-
er of the House. That doesn’t bother 
you? That doesn’t give you pause? Be-
cause there is a whole bunch of those 
kinds of posts on her social media. 
Is there anything that is so awful 
that will give you pause? 
I mean, we heard Mrs. GREENE. She 
came down here and we heard 10 min-
utes of whataboutism and conspiracy, 
you know, and comparing American 
journalists to violent QAnon extrem-
ists. She was basically saying it is not 
her fault—it is everybody else’s fault— 
not taking personal responsibility, and 
really not apologizing for any of these 
really offensive things. 
And so this is one of these moments 
of truth as to, you know, what do we 
think about this institution? I mean, I 
really do think this is a vote about the 
integrity of this institution, and about 
upholding a standard of decency. And, 
quite frankly, we were all hoping you 
would do it. You do the right thing. 
But, apparently, I think a political 
decision was made that it is advan-
tageous not to alienate certain types of 
voters in this country even if they 
think the way and advocate for the 
policies and ideas that Mrs. GREENE 
has put forward. That is what this is 
about. 
And I know I talked to many of my 
colleagues on the other side. I know 
many are very uncomfortable and very 
offended by what she has said and what 
she has posted, but apparently not of-
fended or uncomfortable enough to ac-
tually take action. And I think that 
that is unfortunate. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. SCALISE), the distinguished 
Republican whip of the Congress and 
my good friend. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I have been clear for 
a long time that the comments made 
by Mrs. GREENE prior to being elected a 
Member of Congress are completely in-
appropriate and, in fact, I have spoken 
directly to her to express that. And we 
had a long conversation, frankly, simi-
lar to the one that we just heard on the 
floor a few minutes ago, Madam Speak-
er, where we heard Mrs. GREENE herself 
come and give a full account of things 
she has done in her past. 
In fact, at the end, she said: Jesus 
died on the cross to forgive me of my 
sins. She has actually held herself to 
account as many of us have as well. 
I wonder if that same new standard 
that is being talked about today is an-
ticipated to be applied equally by the 
majority’s side to people who have 
done things egregious and haven’t 
given account and, in fact, on those 
things, as sitting Members of Congress, 
not what happened in 2018, 2019, that 
we all decry. 
But, Madam Speaker, if the things 
that happened in 2018 and 2019 were so 
egregious that they warrant the un-
precedented step of removing a Mem-
ber of Congress from all committees by 
the majority party against someone in 
the minority party, if that was so egre-
gious, why then did not a single Demo-
crat object to that last week when that 
issue came before this Congress on this 
floor and she was added to those com-
mittees? 
This is the resolution that added her 
to the committees. Not a single Demo-
crat last week—not in 2018 or 2019—last 
week, not a single Democrat objected. 
But now this new standard seems to be 
applied. 
This morning, we continued a great 
tradition in this Congress, the National 
Prayer Breakfast, where Republicans 
and Democrats come together and lead-
ers from the entire world come to-
gether to pray. Today, things like for-
giveness were freely discussed. 
I want to read John 8:7. 
So when they continued asking Him, He 
lifted up Himself, and said unto them, He 
that is without sin among you, let him first 
cast a stone at her. 
Madam Speaker, we need to stop 
casting stones at each other and rise to 
the level where we are going to start 
spending every day on this House floor, 
not fighting battles of the past but 
fighting for the hardworking families 
of this country who are counting on us 
to come together. 
I ask that the leadership withdraw 
this resolution and let’s get back to 
work for the American people. 
b 1315 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me say to the 
gentleman who just spoke that I do be-
lieve that the standard that we are up-
holding today should be viewed equally 
for everybody. If any Member of this 
Chamber has advocated for the execu-
tion of another Member, whether it is a 
Democrat or a Republican, I will join 
with everybody here in advocating that 
they be taken off their committees. I 
have said that over and over and over 
again. 
Madam Speaker, is that a controver-
sial idea, that if people advocate that 
kind of stuff, that somehow we are 
going to look the other way or we are 
going to move on and let’s not even 
talk about it? 
And I will remind the gentleman that 
this is not ancient history. She con-
tinues to fundraise off this stuff. Read 
her social media. I am sure you do. So, 
come on. 
And then I am a little confused be-
cause the gentleman was saying we 
shouldn’t be doing this today, we 
should have done it last week when 
there was a unanimous consent request 
to basically move forward a whole 
bunch 
of 
committee 
assignments— 
Democrats and Republicans forward. 
I mean, the deal is, if we had taken 
that down, then a whole bunch of peo-
ple would be without committee as-
signments, as we speak. We have a lot 
of work to do to get this economy on 
the right track and crush this virus, es-
pecially in the aftermath of the 4 years 
we have been through. 
Madam Speaker, we all want to move 
forward. We all want to move on. But 
you can’t move forward unless there is 
some accounting here, unless there is 
some reckoning with what all of this 
means. And I would think that for the 
sake of this institution, if we want to 
uphold the standard of decency in this 
institution, that we will all come to-
gether on this. 
Madam Speaker, what we just heard 
from Mrs. GREENE was not an apology. 
And if that was the speech that was 
given last night in the Republican Con-
ference, I guess my question would be: 
And that got a standing ovation? 
I didn’t hear an apology for the in-
credibly dangerous and hurtful re-
marks that she has made. I didn’t hear 
an explanation for why she is still 
fundraising off of these terrible things 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know what 
my colleagues found so convincing, but 
I stand here today still deeply, deeply 
troubled and offended by the things 
that she has posted and the things that 
she has said and still not taken respon-
sibility for and still not apologized for. 
And the idea of coming to the floor 
and basically saying: Well, it is the me-
dia’s fault, it is this person’s fault or 
that person’s fault—and that the Amer-
ican media is equivalent to the violent 
QAnon extremists, well, I got to tell 
you, just when you think you have 
heard everything, then you hear that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, just quickly for the 
RECORD, so my friend knows, the reso-
lution that the Republican whip, Mr. 
SCALISE, was referring to just a few 
minutes ago only concerned Repub-
licans. So if you wanted to object to 
Republicans, that is what you could

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H344 
February 4, 2021 
have done. It didn’t involve Democrats 
at all. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to amend House rules 
to state that any resolution proposing 
to remove a Member from a committee 
assignment shall not be in order unless 
offered by, or with the concurrence of, 
the leader of the party of the Member 
that is the subject of the resolution. 
Madam Speaker, this speaks to a 
norm of basic fairness that today’s res-
olution does not comply with. In the 
past, the majority has never attempted 
to exercise a veto over the minority’s 
committee assignments, nor has the 
minority ever attempted to do the 
same to the majority. 
This has been, in the past, an unwrit-
ten rule, a norm the House has adhered 
to in order to protect the operations of 
the institution. But the majority’s ac-
tions today threaten that norm and 
threaten to set off a new round of esca-
lating partisan punishment anytime 
the majority changes hands. Enshrin-
ing historical practice as a new rule is 
an important step to protect the insti-
tution as a whole. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I respond by saying 
to the gentleman: We have been wait-
ing. We have been Members now for 
over a month in this new Congress, and 
we have been waiting for action. I 
guess we got the answer last night: A 
standing ovation for somebody who has 
said and posted what Mrs. GREENE has 
said and posted. I mean, that is the re-
sponse. We have waited, and now we 
are going to move forward with this ac-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, just in response to 
my good friend: I was actually there. 
So, number one, she didn’t get a stand-
ing ovation for things that she said. 
She got a standing ovation for regret-
ting things that she had said, and say-
ing she has been wrong, and denounc-
ing QAnon and denouncing school 
shootings. That is what she got the 
standing ovation for. My friend didn’t 
have the opportunity to hear that. I 
wanted to take the opportunity to in-
form him. 
Madam Speaker, I would advise my 
friend that I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I oppose 
the rule. Never before in the history of 
this institution has the majority at-
tempted to exercise a veto over the mi-
nority’s right to make committee as-
signments, yet, today, the majority is 
choosing to do just that. This leads the 
institution down a dangerous path, the 
end of which we cannot see. 
Madam Speaker, there are alter-
native paths open that I believe the 
House should consider. We owe it to 
ourselves and to the institution to do 
so. Before we strip a Member of their 
committees for remarks that person 
made before they were subject to the 
official rules of conduct of the House, 
maybe we ought to have a discussion 
about that, if we are going to extend 
that in a way we never have before in 
the institution. I am not necessarily 
against that, by the way. I think that 
is a worthy topic. 
I also think that if we are going to 
strip a Member before they ever served 
on a committee, they ought to have an 
opportunity to tell their side of the 
story in a judicious proceeding. Our 
Committee on Ethics has resolved a lot 
of naughty issues in a very bipartisan 
way, and not with Members escaping 
punishment. So to say we have asked 
for nothing be done, it is quite the op-
posite. 
We have said: Let’s go to the Com-
mittee on Ethics. 
Let’s hash through these tough issues 
of changing the scope of the official 
conduct provisions of the House that 
applies to Members. 
Let’s talk about whether or not it is 
appropriate for the majority to actu-
ally try to dictate the people that the 
minority puts on committees. 
And, finally, let’s give a Member that 
we accuse of something an opportunity 
to make his or her case. 
That is what we have asked for, and 
that is what the majority has chosen 
not to do. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is a dan-
gerous mistake. It is a mistake that, 
frankly, when the majority changes, 
the temptation will be overwhelming 
for a Member to say: ‘‘Oh, well, there is 
a Member I didn’t like or said some-
thing or did something I didn’t like. As 
a Member, I think I am just going to 
take 
that 
committee 
assignment 
away.’’ 
I can give you a list of people that 
have done things that I think are inap-
propriate, on both sides of the aisle, 
quite frankly. But we have never done 
that here, and I don’t think we should 
start doing that here. All we have 
asked for is a process, a Committee on 
Ethics discussion. We think that is the 
appropriate way to proceed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question, ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, this is a very seri-
ous matter, and I appreciate my rank-
ing member, Mr. COLE, for the way he 
conducts himself because I know he 
cares deeply about this institution, and 
he knows that I admire him greatly. 
The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE) was on the floor, and he 
quoted the Bible. And I have read the 
Bible, too, I want to inform the gen-
tleman. And I believe in the Jesuit tra-
dition. 
Apology is not just words, it is ac-
tion. And I didn’t hear Mrs. GREENE do 
that 
today. 
I 
heard 
a 
lot 
about 
whataboutisms, but I didn’t hear her 
take responsibility, nor did I hear her 
apologize for some of the most egre-
gious things that she has posted and 
said. 
I also point out for the record—be-
cause I think this is important—I am 
not convinced her memory is 100 per-
cent accurate here on some things. 
Here, just now—and she spoke to the 
whole Chamber—she said she didn’t 
discuss QAnon during her campaign. 
Madam Speaker, but last July, she 
said in her local interview: ‘‘I’ve only 
ever seen patriotic sentiment coming 
out of that source.’’ And she wouldn’t 
answer if she was still a follower. 
So I am a little confused that she is 
now trying to denounce QAnon, yet she 
said recently that they are patriots. 
She said: Never seen anything other 
than patriotic sentiment coming out of 
that source. 
QAnon is a dangerous, sick cult. Pe-
riod. And nobody—certainly nobody in 
this Chamber—should ever, in any way, 
shape, or form, try to associate them-
selves with them. They are not patri-
otic individuals. They are pushing sick, 
dangerous, violent conspiracy theories. 
Many of the people who attacked this 
Chamber on January 6 had their QAnon 
flags and insignias. So give me a break. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know what 
it is going to take for some here to act. 
And I will just repeat what I said ear-
lier. I don’t know what the hell hap-
pened to the Republican Party. The 
party of Lincoln, the party of Eisen-
hower, the party of Reagan is becoming 
the party of MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE 
and the party of violent conspiracy 
theories. 
If anyone has any question about the 
things that she has said or done—any-
body who is watching—just spend a 
moment and look at her social media 
posts. Don’t take my word for it. Go re-
search it for yourself. Google it. It is 
all there. They go well beyond any-
thing that we have seen from any 
Member in this body. 
Encouraging violence against an-
other Member; 
Posting and saying that 9/11 was a 
hoax; 
That school shootings were planned 
by gun safety advocates; 
Spreading 
anti-Semitic 
and 
anti- 
Muslim conspiracies and hate speech. 
It is all there. We are not just saying 
this. It is there. 
Madam Speaker, now, I am a big be-
liever of the Committee on Ethic’s 
process, but I don’t need an investiga-
tion to tell me what I can read with my 
own eyes. The only question is this: 
What are we going to do about it?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H345 
February 4, 2021 
Just as there was bipartisan agree-
ment that Congressman KING had no 
business on a committee, there should 
be bipartisan agreement that Congress-
woman GREENE doesn’t either. 
The only reason this is taking a reso-
lution on the floor today is that Leader 
MCCARTHY is unwilling to apply that 
same standard here. A stern conversa-
tion is not enough. We aren’t talking 
about expulsion here today. Though, 
some think that that is warranted, but 
that is not what we are talking about. 
We are deciding whether someone who 
has encouraged violence against Mem-
bers should be given a platform on a 
standing committee. That is what the 
topic is here today. 
And I have to say, I didn’t even know 
that was a question. I assume the an-
swer was obvious, but apparently it is 
not to some here. 
Madam Speaker, inaction is com-
plicity. We must set a standard of con-
duct in this institution and ensure that 
the violence, conspiracy theories, and 
the lies that we see on the darkest cor-
ners of the internet don’t get a plat-
form on a standing committee here in 
the House of Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will vote their conscience. I 
hope my colleagues will do what is 
right for the institution. This is about 
the institution, about who we are. 
Again, for the life of me, I don’t under-
stand what is complicated here, what is 
giving people hesitation. 
We know the results of these violent 
conspiracy theorists. We saw that on 
January 6. We know what it leads to. I 
don’t ever want to see that again. And 
we all should make clear where we 
stand 
on 
this. 
So 
Congresswoman 
GREENE coming here and speaking for 
10 minutes and not taking responsi-
bility for any of this stuff, trying to 
make us believe that she doesn’t be-
lieve in QAnon anymore—I just pointed 
to an interview that was fairly recent— 
not apologizing for the most egregious 
comments that she has posted. 
Madam Speaker, we have to be better 
than this. This can’t be the future. And 
I am hoping that we will get a bipar-
tisan vote here because I do think, as I 
said before, a strong bipartisan vote on 
this, what a refreshing signal that 
would be to the American people that 
all of us together are standing up 
against hate, against violence, against 
conspiracy theories; that we are to-
gether on this. This shouldn’t be hard. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 91 
Strike all after the resolved clause and in-
sert the following: 
‘‘That clause 5(a)(1) of rule X is amended 
by designating the existing text as subdivi-
sion (A) and adding the following new sub-
divisions: 
‘‘(B) A resolution proposing to remove a 
Member from a committee shall not be in 
order unless offered by, or with the concur-
rence of, the Leader of the party of the Mem-
ber that is the subject of the resolution.’’. 
‘‘(C) The Committee on Rules may not re-
port a rule or order that waives the applica-
tion of subdivision (B).’’. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 218, nays 
209, not voting 4, as follows:

REMOVING A CERTAIN MEMBER 
FROM CERTAIN STANDING COM-
MITTEES 
OF 
THE 
HOUSE 
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 91, I call up the 
resolution (H. Res. 72) removing a cer-
tain Member from certain standing 
committees of the House of Represent-
atives, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 91, the resolu-
tion is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 72 
Whereas clause 1 of rule XXIII of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives provides, ‘‘A 
Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, 
officer, or employee of the House shall be-
have at all times in a manner that shall re-
flect creditably on the House.’’; and 
Whereas Representative Marjorie Taylor 
Greene should be removed from her com-
mittee assignments in light of conduct she 
has exhibited: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
ber be, and is hereby, removed from the fol-
lowing standing committees of the House of 
Representatives: 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET: Mrs. Greene of 
Georgia. 
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR: Mrs. 
Greene of Georgia. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for one hour, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and the ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Ethics. 
The gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DEUTCH) and the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. WALORSKI) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 72. 
In 
2019, 
the 
FBI 
warned 
that 
‘‘antigovernment, identity-based, and 
fringe political conspiracy theories 
very likely to motivate some domestic 
extremists to commit criminal, some-
times violent activity.’’ 
In October last year, this House 
voted nearly unanimously to condemn 
QAnon conspiracy theories because 
they encourage the rejection of objec-
tive reality, deepen political polariza-
tion, and undermine trust in our demo-
cratic institutions; but also because 
they have inspired real-world violence, 
bomb threats, vandalism, kidnapping, 
terrorism, murder, and insurrection. 
Congresswoman GREENE of Georgia 
has a long history of amplifying dan-
gerous conspiracy theories online and 
threatening 
violent, 
racist, 
Islamophobic, and anti-Semitic con-
duct. H. Res. 72 will ensure that Mrs. 
GREENE’s conduct is not rewarded with 
seats on two important committees. 
The Congresswoman has said that 
American citizens who practice Islam 
‘‘do not belong in our government,’’ 
and ‘‘they should stay in their coun-
try.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is their country, 
and it is their government as much as 
any American’s. 
Mrs. GREENE has trafficked in dan-
gerous anti-Semitic lies about the 
Rothschild family, George Soros, Zion-
ist supremacists, and secret Jewish 
plots. 
Over millennia, because of baseless, 
ugly lies, millions of Jews have been 
hated, targeted, expelled from their 
countries, violently attacked, killed, 
and exterminated because words lead 
to action and death. 
Mrs. GREENE claimed the mass shoot-
ing at Sandy Hook Elementary School 
in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed

26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-old 
kids, was staged. She claimed the Las 
Vegas shooting that killed 60 people 
and injured over 800 was an orches-
trated attempt to weaken gun rights. 
And she claimed the shooting at Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas High School 
was a false flag event and called the 
survivors crisis actors. 
Mr. Speaker, the 17 people who never 
came home from school in Parkland on 
February 14, 2018, were my constitu-
ents. Their families’ pain is real, and it 
is felt every single day. 
Yesterday, parents of children slain 
at Sandy Hook, Mark Barden, Daniel’s 
dad; and Nicole Hockley, Dylan’s mom, 
wrote a letter to Leader MCCARTHY to 
share how these conspiracy theories 
impact their families: ‘‘These vicious 
lies deny the deaths of our murdered 
children and bring death threats and 
constant harassment to our doors and 
our surviving children.’’ 
In 2019, Mrs. GREENE created a White 
House petition to impeach Speaker 
PELOSI for treason, emphasizing that it 
is punishable by death, and she liked a 
Facebook comment stating that: ‘‘A 
bullet to the head would be a quicker 
way to remove Speaker Nancy Pelosi.’’ 
In a video statement from December 
31, 2018, Mrs. GREENE called on her fol-
lowers to storm Washington, D.C., in 
what sounds today like a prescient 
forecast of last month’s deadly insur-
rection: Flood the Capitol. Flood all 
the government buildings. Go inside. 
We can end it. We can do it peacefully. 
We can. I hope we don’t have to do it 
the other way, but we should feel like 
we will if we have to. 
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what 
happened. 
Conspiracy theories and hate are ma-
lignant. They do not fade away. We 
must stand up to them and say, 
Enough. 
Mrs. GREENE has promised that she 
will never apologize. 
Well, we are here today because Re-
publican leadership has decided to em-
brace and elevate Mrs. GREENE. They 
rewarded her with a seat on the com-
mittee of this House that has responsi-
bility for teaching our children the 
truth and giving them a safe place to 
learn it. 
Two years ago, the Republican leader 
spoke on this floor, very strongly say-
ing, ‘‘I will pledge to you this, from 
this side of the aisle, and I hope you 
understand this clearly, any hatred, we 
take action.’’ 
Mr. MCCARTHY did take action, but it 
wasn’t condemnation. It was elevation, 
appointing her to committee seats. 
That is why it is necessary to put 
this resolution to a vote for every 
Member of this body because this 
House must take action. I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution and 
remove 
Representative 
GREENE
of 
Georgia from her positions on the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor and the 
Committee on Budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: I abso-
lutely reject racism, anti-Semitism, 
and bigotry. I condemn conspiracy 
theories and calls for violence. I do not, 
in any way, condone these reprehen-
sible views. I am not here today to de-
fend any comments made by Rep-
resentative GREENE, whether as a pri-
vate citizen, candidate, or Member of 
Congress. 
I am here today to defend the prece-
dent set by years of the majority and 
minority parties coexisting in this 
body; and I am here today to defend 
the House Ethics Committee, on which 
I serve as the ranking member. 
b 1630 
H. Res. 72 is nothing more than a par-
tisan power grab at a critical time 
when the majority party itself repeat-
edly calls for unity as our path for-
ward. Bringing a majority resolution 
to the floor to remove a minority Mem-
ber from her committee assignments is 
wrong and unprecedented. 
Referring such a resolution to the 
House Ethics Committee is unprece-
dented. Referring such a resolution to 
the House Ethics Committee and then 
completely bypassing the committee’s 
role is unprecedented. On this floor 
today we are witnessing one more ef-
fort to consolidate power with a major-
ity party and diminish the rights of the 
minority. 
This is not the first power grab effort 
by this majority in Congress. Earlier 
this year, the Democrats destroyed 
over 100 years of representation in Con-
gress and effectively eliminated the 
only tool that safeguarded the minori-
ty’s voice: the motion to recommit. 
And they are doing it again today with 
H. Res. 72. 
In the last 20 years, several Members 
have been removed from their com-
mittee duties. Members on both sides 
of the aisle have been removed and for 
various reasons. But those reasons and 
that decision was always made by the 
Member’s party leadership, or party’s 
membership. Even if the decision to re-
move a Member was followed with a 
voice vote on the House floor, the deci-
sion itself was made by that Member’s 
caucus following weeks of public and 
private infighting. 
Last night, the Republican Con-
ference met to discuss statements 
made by Representative GREENE prior 
to her serving the Congress. We lis-
tened to Representative GREENE. She 
made similar statements as she did on 
the floor today. She assured the Con-
ference that her prior statements did 
not reflect her views today as a mem-
ber of this body. 
The Democratic majority claims the 
Republican Conference hasn’t acted, 
but that simply isn’t true. The Con-
ference just hasn’t done what the 
Democrats want it to do. 
Regardless, the majority has brought 
this unprecedented resolution before 
the House today. The majority party 
could have brought this matter di-
rectly to the floor as a privileged ques-
tion and the question of removal would 
have been a swift vote on the floor. 
Instead, the majority referred the 
resolution to the Ethics Committee to 
then immediately and completely by-
pass the Ethics Committee and its 
functions by bringing this resolution 
directly to the floor. 
Involving the committee, then to 
only bypass the committee, violates 
the collegial and bipartisan manner by 
which the Ethics Committee should op-
erate. 
This is my second term serving on 
the Ethics Committee and I was look-
ing forward to working with Chairman 
DEUTCH in a collegial and bipartisan 
manner. You see, the Committee on 
Ethics is unique. It is the only stand-
ing House committee with equal num-
bers of Democrat and Republican Mem-
bers: five Democrats and five Repub-
licans. 
There is a reason that neither party 
holds a majority on this committee 
and that reason is to avoid one party or 
the other weaponizing the committee’s 
purpose for use in a political and par-
tisan fashion. 
The committee has publicly warned 
of this risk before. In 2012, following a 
particularly contentious investigation, 
the committee publicly expressed the 
necessity of bipartisan cooperation 
within the committee leadership. 
The committee stated: ‘‘Unlike any 
other 
committee, 
this 
committee 
avoids partisan legislative concerns 
and policies, and must have bipartisan 
cooperation for the committee to ful-
fill its constitutional mandate to po-
lice the Members, officers and employ-
ees of the House. That mission calls 
upon Members to step out of their par-
tisan framework and approach the 
work of the committee without regard 
to their party. It is our recommenda-
tion, for any Member that serves on 
this committee, that he or she con-
stantly evaluate their actions on the 
committee to ensure that they are liv-
ing up to the highest standards of this 
committee.’’ 
Today, we do not see the Ethics Com-
mittee’s leadership upholding the high-
est standards of bipartisan coopera-
tion. We don’t see today the chair and 
ranking member presenting a resolu-
tion on the House floor together. 
At the end of each Congress, the com-
mittee issues a report detailing the ac-
tivities of the committee during the 
Congress. For each Congress Chairman 
DEUTCH has served on Ethics, the com-
mittee has worked in a collegial and 
bipartisan manner, to be able to state 
that—for the 113th, 114th, 115th, and 
116th Congress—all votes taken in the 
investigative 
subcommittees 
were 
unanimous. 
This stack of public reports rep-
resents all the hard work the com-
mittee has completed in the last four 
Congresses. All of this work of the 
committee—completed by its sitting

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H349 
February 4, 2021 
Members, the Members who were asked 
to serve in the investigative sub-
committees and the committee’s pro-
fessional and nonpartisan staff—was 
accomplished in bipartisan coopera-
tion. 
In fact, Chairman DEUTCH
himself 
recognized in the committee report for 
the 116th Congress that: ‘‘All of the 
committee’s work . . . is made possible 
by the committee’s talented, profes-
sional, nonpartisan staff. The members 
of the committee wish to acknowledge 
their hard work and dedication to the 
committee and the House. In addition, 
the committee wishes to thank its de-
parting Members . . . for their service 
and 
for 
the 
thoughtfulness 
and 
collegiality they showed during their 
time on the committee.’’ 
As you can see, the work on the Eth-
ics Committee is extensive. In the 
116th Congress alone, the committee 
commenced or continued investigative 
fact-finding gatherings for 50 separate 
investigative matters, impaneled six 
investigative committees, and filed 
five reports with the House, totaling 
over 3,300 pages regarding various in-
vestigative matters. 
These tasks were agreed to by the 
chair and the ranking member of the 
committee. In fact, the phrase itself, 
‘‘chair and ranking minority member’’ 
appears 38 times, 38 times in the com-
mittee rules. The Ethics Committee 
operates effectively because it is con-
sensus driven with decisions made 
jointly by the chair and the ranking 
member. 
But that is not what is happening 
today on this floor. The current chair 
and ranking member have not received 
a complaint and determined whether 
the information meets the require-
ments of the committee rules. 
The current chair and ranking mem-
ber have not jointly gathered informa-
tion concerning this alleged conduct. 
Until yesterday’s Rules hearing, the 
chair and the ranking member had not 
had a single conversation regarding 
Representative GREENE. 
As I stated earlier, involving the 
committee then to only bypass its 
function, violates the spirit of how this 
unique committee operates. Once a ma-
jority determined that the Ethics Com-
mittee was the place for the resolution, 
it should have allowed the committee 
to consider the issues properly. 
I know our colleagues want to see the 
Ethics Committee function effectively 
and not to be used as a partisan polit-
ical weapon on a manipulated plat-
form. If the Ethics Committee is to 
consider reviewing statements made by 
Members of Congress before they were 
sworn in, then the matter should come 
before the Ethics Committee in a way 
that complies with committee rules, 
preserves the bipartisanship intended, 
and allows the committee to make 
legal conclusions and factual deter-
minations in a collegial environment. 
All I ask is that we let the com-
mittee work, as it is supposed to, to ef-
fectively serve this body. To do so, the 
majority should withdraw this resolu-
tion if it chooses, and pursue the mat-
ter properly through the Ethics Com-
mittee. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H. Res. 
72. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I also note Republican colleagues 
purport not to defend any of Represent-
ative GREENE’s hateful statements or 
reprehensible conduct, instead, rely on 
process. The appeals to process should 
be recognized for what they are, an ef-
fort to shield her from her account-
ability for her egregious language and 
actions. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), my friend and 
colleague from south Florida who has 
come to know the families from Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas, as well as I, 
and the sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
I rise to support H. Res. 72, legisla-
tion I never hoped to author. 
My resolution would remove Con-
gresswoman MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE 
from her committee assignments. We 
have already heard today a lot about 
precedents, so let me explain the prece-
dents which brought us here. 
Congresswoman GREENE
advocated 
for the execution of a leader of this 
House. She advocated for the execution 
of former President Obama. She en-
couraged violence against law enforce-
ment and has a long record of racist, 
anti-Semitic, and Islamophobic com-
ments. 
She spread cruel conspiracy theories, 
even claiming the horrific mass school 
shootings in Sandy Hook and Parkland 
were staged, and even stalked a young 
survivor of one of those tragedies, call-
ing him a ‘‘coward.’’ 
These are unprecedented comments 
and actions by a Member. No one else 
on this floor has called for violence 
against other Members and law en-
forcement. Only one Member has done 
that and refused to back down, and 
that is the real precedent we are deal-
ing with today. 
We have also heard about regrettable 
conduct before taking office, a so- 
called statute of limitations on bad be-
havior. Prior to her floor remarks this 
afternoon, 
Congresswoman 
GREENE 
spent this entire week doubling down 
on her promotion of violence, bigotry, 
and conspiracy theories. 
Her response to her critics just yes-
terday was: ‘‘I won’t back down. I’ll 
never apologize.’’ 
We have also heard today about re-
venge and whataboutism. GREENE her-
self threatened that when Republicans 
wield the gavel, Democrats will face a 
similar fate. 
And if a Democrat proposes violence 
against Members and peddles dan-
gerous lies and conspiracy theories, 
then refuses to renounce them and our 
caucus refuses to police it, then pun-
ishment would be in order. 
That is the reality of what we are 
dealing with today with Congress-
woman GREENE. We are dealing with 
conduct that brings shame on this 
House and a pointed refusal to de-
nounce or internally police it by Re-
publicans. 
Congresswoman GREENE’s past sup-
port and present reaffirmation for vio-
lence, intimidation, lies, and racism is 
dangerous. It is exactly the kind of 
conduct that helps fuel domestic ter-
rorism. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t take this threat 
of violence lightly. Two years ago, a 
pipe bomb, one of 16 sent around the 
country in my name, sat in my district 
office for more than 24 hours with my 
staff handling and moving around it be-
fore anyone knew or told them it pos-
sibly contained an explosive device. 
None of my staff signed up for that 
kind of threat. No one should be terror-
ized at work. 
But what delivered that bomb to my 
office was not just one disturbed man. 
It was the culmination of endless lies, 
conspiracy theories, and hate that 
drove someone to violently attack his 
political rivals. 
We all saw that unfold again with 
deadly consequences here in the Cap-
itol on January 6. We can’t afford to 
have these kinds of violent threats con-
tinue and certainly not from someone 
in this very House. This is not about 
whether we find MARJORIE
TAYLOR 
GREENE’s speech offensive. 
The point here is that she has pro-
moted and advocated violence. Denying 
her a seat at committee tables where 
fact-based policies will be debated and 
crafted is an appropriate punishment 
and restraint of her influence. 
Congresswoman GREENE chose a dan-
gerous and harmful path into this 
House, one filled with deliberate lies 
that fomented violence. Once elected 
and seated here as a sitting Member, 
she then also chose not only to stand 
by, but affirm those words and actions. 
A deathbed, mild walk back of a cou-
ple of wild conspiracy theories just mo-
ments ago is not enough to prevent her 
future harm. Importantly, there was no 
apology for the hurt and harm caused, 
and she did not express regret for the 
stalking of a teenage mass-shooting 
victim; nor for life-threatening state-
ments she made or promoted against 
the leader of this House, and so much 
more. 
Now that she has made her choices, 
the House must limit the future harm 
and violence that she can invite on this 
body. The deceptive and inflammatory

conduct that fueled such violence can-
not be tolerated anywhere, certainly 
not in this House. 
We can take an important step to-
ward restoring integrity, security, de-
corum, and truth in this House by re-
moving Congresswoman MARJORIE TAY-
LOR GREENE from her committee as-
signments. 
While it is an action we do not take 
lightly, it is the necessary course of ac-
tion in the face of her extraordinary 
behavior that is unbecoming of a Mem-
ber of Congress. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY), the Repub-
lican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H. Res. 72. This resolu-
tion sets a dangerous new standard 
that will only deepen divisions within 
this House. 
For all of their talk about norms and 
institutions, it is the Democrats who 
have acted to undermine the people’s 
House at every turn. 
Let’s check the RECORD. Afraid for 
their 
political 
careers, 
they 
have 
moved to shut down debate and silence 
dissent in committee and on this floor. 
They went so far as to eliminate the 
motion to recommit—the minority par-
ty’s only chance to offer an amend-
ment—which stood for over a century 
until this year. 
They 
have 
rushed 
impeachment 
through without a shred of due process, 
just like today, reducing this tool from 
the highest constitutional remedy to 
just another opportunity to fundraise 
and go on TV. 
And now, they are declaring the ma-
jority has veto power over the minori-
ty’s member selections for committee. 
b 1645 
We have reviewed this with the histo-
rians. Never before in the history of 
this House has the majority abused its 
power in this way. Never in the entire 
history of this House have you ever 
abused the power in this way. 
But it is clear Speaker PELOSI’s Cau-
cus thinks differently. They are blind-
ed by partisanship and politics, and it 
is the American people who will suffer 
the most because of it. 
Mr. Speaker, as for the Member in 
question, let me be very clear: Rep-
resentative GREENE’s past comments 
and posts as a private citizen do not 
represent the values of my party. As a 
Republican, as a conservative, as an 
American, I condemn those views un-
equivocally. I condemned them when 
they first surfaced, and I condemn 
them today. 
Mr. Speaker, this House overwhelm-
ingly voted to condemn the dangerous 
lies of QAnon last Congress and con-
tinues to do so. I made this clear when 
I met with Representative GREENE. 
I also made clear that we, as Mem-
bers, have a responsibility to hold our-
selves to a higher standard. She ac-
knowledged this during our conversa-
tion and apologized for her past com-
ments. I will hold her to her words and 
her actions moving forward. 
Because these comments caused such 
deep wounds, I offered Leader HOYER a 
path to lower the temperature and ad-
dress these concerns in a productive 
way. I offered to remove Representa-
tive GREENE from the Committee on 
Education and Labor, but it was re-
jected. It was rejected. 
Now, privately, I have had calls from 
many Democrats, acknowledging what 
they are doing is wrong. They under-
stand that this partisan power grab is 
not only cynical, it is hypocritical. If 
this is the new standard, I look forward 
to continuing out the standard because 
if you look for a side that has a leader-
ship that has done something when 
their Members do something as a Mem-
ber, not prior, look to me, because I did 
just that. 
But when a Democrat freshman said, 
‘‘Israel has hypnotized the world,’’ that 
supporting Israel is ‘‘all about the Ben-
jamins,’’ and that 9/11 was ‘‘some peo-
ple did something,’’ did Speaker PELOSI 
kick her off the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs, or did she keep her on the com-
mittee and even pose with her on the 
cover of a magazine? 
Will the standard change? 
When another Democrat was com-
promised by a Chinese spy, and it was 
so serious that the FBI had to brief 
congressional 
leaders, 
did 
Speaker 
PELOSI
remove him from the House 
Committee on Intelligence or the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security after the 
briefing? 
I am the only other person that had 
that same briefing just recently. I was 
in the room with the Speaker. I heard 
what was said. I will be very clear: I 
would never have that Member on ei-
ther of those committees. 
Or did she reward him by making 
him the head of the subcommittee 
overseeing the CIA? 
I guess there are different standards. 
Mr. Speaker, when the chairman of 
the Committee on Rules objected to 
certifying the 2016 election, citing Rus-
sian interference, did Speaker PELOSI 
censure him? 
How about when the chairwoman of 
the Committee on Financial Services 
told supporters at a rally in 2017—she 
was a Member then, unlike the person 
we are talking about today—‘‘If you 
see anybody from that Cabinet in a res-
taurant, in a department store, at a 
gasoline station, you get out and you 
create a crowd. And you push back on 
them, and you tell them they are not 
welcome anymore, anywhere.’’ 
After she called for violence against 
public servants, did Speaker PELOSI 
condemn it, or did she look the other 
way and make her chairwoman again? 
I don’t know if you want to amend 
this one and add others so you can 
keep your standard. The answer is ob-
vious. While Democrats attack Con-
gresswoman GREENE, they not only ig-
nore the infractions within their own 
party, they reward these Members with 
prestige and influence. 
Mr. Speaker, when it comes time to 
vote, I expect Democrats will codify 
this partisan power grab. I would ad-
vise them to think twice and pull this 
resolution from the floor while they 
still can. 
I have heard Democrats quote the 
Senate minority leader to defend this 
resolution. I would remind them what 
Leader MCCONNELL said when Demo-
crats voted to nuke the judicial fili-
buster: ‘‘You will regret this, and you 
may regret this a lot sooner than you 
think.’’ 
If that is the new standard, if people 
are held to what they have said prior 
to even being in this House, if the ma-
jority party gets to decide who sits on 
whatever committees, I hope you keep 
that standard because we have a long 
list you can work within your own. 
Mr. Speaker, in the end, this resolu-
tion is merely a distraction from the 
real issues. In the last 2 weeks, Demo-
crats have taken just two votes: the 
one today and the one last month on a 
waiver for a Cabinet member. 
This is the least productive Congress 
since last year. I thought that would be 
hard to beat. 
There is nothing for workers who 
have lost their jobs, including thou-
sands of blue-collar jobs that were 
eliminated just by a stroke of a pen of 
President Biden, even laying off the 
union workers who endorsed him. It is 
a shame. They need that job. It is a 
good-paying job. Nobody sat and talked 
to them before or asked them. They 
just laid them off. 
Nothing for students who have been 
stuck learning from behind screens for 
nearly a year, even though the admin-
istration’s CDC Director says in-person 
learning is safe. 
Nothing to increase the pace of vac-
cine distributions so we can get them 
to people who want them and get one 
step closer to fully reopening this econ-
omy. 
At a time when households are al-
ready struggling, Congress should use 
its window of opportunity to get Amer-
icans back to work, kids back to 
school, and vaccines for any American 
who wants it. 
These are the immediate priorities 
that deserve our energy and our atten-
tion. This is what we would work on if 
we had the opportunity to be in the 
majority or even had the same oppor-
tunity that those in the minority had 
for last 100 years: to offer a motion to 
recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said before, a House 
distracted cannot govern, and we are 
proving it one more time today. Let’s 
stop trying to invent dangerous and di-
visive ways to abuse the power of a ma-
jority and start working on what really 
matters. 
No one supports what was said before 
a person ever became a Member. When 
a Member said something that was in-
appropriate on this side of the aisle, we 
removed them from committee because 
they said it when they were a Member. 
As we list the long list of the stand-
ards on the other side, no, no one ever

got removed. They got rewarded. And 
now, the more than 200-year-history in 
this body is going to change. But if it 
changed as a standard to reach all, I 
will be right here with you. 
If the concern was really what the 
majority leader said to me about being 
on the Committee on Education and 
Labor, I am the first one to switch it. 
I actually offered it. That would be ap-
propriate. 
But not for this majority. They be-
lieve something different, and that is 
wrong, just as the words that were said 
were wrong. 
That Member came to this floor to 
answer those questions. She did it as a 
Member of Congress, not as a private 
citizen, when they were said. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to President 
Biden as I watched him sworn in. I 
heard the word ‘‘unity.’’ That is why I 
reached out, as well. If there is concern 
about education, we can fix that. If 
there is concern on the other side 
about working with people or getting 
laid off with every stroke of every ex-
ecutive order, I will work to fix that. If 
there is concern about getting kids 
back in school, we will work on that. If 
there is concern about getting a vac-
cine to any American who wants it, we 
will work on that. 
But unfortunately, the majority gets 
to decide what comes to the floor. And 
once again, this Congress will get list-
ed as the least productive Congress in 
history. 
But the one thing it will have a 
record of is changing the rules to be 
one-sided, a long history that I believe 
this body will be embarrassed by. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague and friend from Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2 weeks, I celebrate 
the birthday of my son, Jordan. Every 
year since he was murdered, his birth-
day brings joyful memories but pro-
found sadness. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, my pain on 
his birthday turned to horror and grief 
as I watched students in Parkland, 
children the same age as my son, run 
terrified out of their high school. 
I watched parents read texts from 
their kids that said: Mom, if I don’t 
make it back, thank you for every-
thing that you have done for me. 
I watched as 17 families realized that 
their lives are never going to be the 
same. 
Mr. Speaker, throughout history, 
words have shown and have had the 
power to unite this Nation with unity 
and hope, or the power to divide with 
bigotry and hate. Words have an im-
pact on everything that we do here in 
this Chamber, on this Hill, in this 
body. Every action that we take makes 
life better for the American people. 
This today is about a Member’s 
words and actions that are beneath 
this body, beneath the American people 
that we have sworn to protect. 
This is about a Member stalking the 
children of tragedy, attacking sur-
vivors, and threatening violence. This 
is about a Member denying the exist-
ence of dead children at Sandy Hook 
Elementary and Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School. This moment is 
about parents across America who now 
celebrate their child’s birthday just 
like me. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, who is 
next? Who is next? 
Everyone has said things they wish 
they didn’t say. Everyone has done 
things they wish they didn’t do. 
So who is next? Who will the cancel 
culture attack next? 
Former New York Times editor Bari 
Weiss—not a conservative—had to re-
sign because of the environment at 
that paper. She had to resign—she 
coined 
this 
term—the 
‘‘digital 
thunderdome.’’ 
You engage in wrong-think? You en-
gage in wrong-speak? You are going in 
the thunderdome. 
Today, it is Mrs. GREENE. Who is it 
going to be tomorrow? 
I have heard several times on the 
floor today from the Democrats, ‘‘con-
spiracy theory.’’ The Democrats ped-
dled the biggest conspiracy theory of 
all time, the Russia hoax. 
For the last 4 years, they peddled 
this theory. Two of those years, they 
spent $40 million, 19 lawyers, 40 FBI 
agents, 500 witnesses, 2,500 subpoenas, 
but came up with zero collusion. 
The former Director of National In-
telligence, 
James 
Clapper, 
he 
was 
going on television all the time, talk-
ing about the coordination and the col-
lusion that was going on. But what did 
he say behind closed doors when he was 
under oath in the Intelligence Com-
mittee? He said this: I never saw any 
evidence that the Trump campaign was 
conspiring with the Russians to meddle 
with the election. 
No evidence, but they peddled this 
theory for 4 years. 
And think about this: The guy who 
started the debate off today for the 
Democrats, the Democrat chair of the 
Committee on Rules, 4 years ago, guess 
who was the first person to object to 
the 2016 Presidential election? The guy 
who kicked off the debate for the 
Democrats today going after Mrs. 
GREENE, the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts. Guess what his reason was: 
the Russian hoax conspiracy theory. 
And guess which State he objected 
to. Alabama. 
b 1700 
That is right, January 6, 2017, the 
guy who kicked off the debate from the 
Democrats objected to Alabama, a 
State that President Trump won by 30 
points. The first person to kick off the 
debate today 4 years ago objected to 
Alabama based on this Russian hoax 
conspiracy theory. And now, they are 
coming after Mrs. GREENE. 
I stood right here 3 weeks ago, and I 
said this cancel culture will not just 
come after Republicans; it is going to 
come after us all. It is going to come 
after us all. This is what is scary. And 
it took all of 13 days—all of 13 days— 
for that to be proven true. 
Last week, Senator DIANNE
FEIN-
STEIN Elementary School is no longer 
named after Senator FEINSTEIN. That is 
how bad this is. 
I hope this stops, and I hope it stops 
soon. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
when we talk about unity, let’s remem-
ber we were united last October when 
the House came together almost unani-
mously to condemn QAnon in a resolu-
tion that I had introduced. We said 
that QAnon was fanning the flames of 
anti-Semitism, that the looney lies it 
was spreading online would lead to peo-
ple being killed in the real world. 
But then yesterday, Mr. MCCARTHY, 
the minority leader, said something 
that mystified me. He cited that reso-
lution as a reason not to remove Rep-
resentative GREENE
from her com-
mittee. We had already condemned 
QAnon, he suggested, so why would we 
need to do anything else? 
It is like saying: We condemned bank 
robbery last year. We don’t need to ac-
tually stop any bank robbers this year. 
How could almost 400 of us say that 
QAnon is a threat and then when we 
see someone who has spent years 
spreading the same conspiracy theo-
ries, the same anti-Semitism, the same 
calls for violence, someone who 3 days 
ago called her critics pedophiles—not 2 
years ago; 3 days ago—then say that 
person should be given all the privi-
leges of a Member of the House? 
Mr. Speaker, if you condemn QAnon, 
that means you have to fight it. If you 
believe that these conspiracy theories 
are dangerous, you have to separate 
yourself from the people who are 
spreading them. 
If even a substantial number of us 
stand 
with 
Representative 
GREENE 
today, violent extremists will see it as 
another sign that they have a legiti-
mate place in our national debate, that 
respectable leaders in our society ei-
ther embrace them or fear them too 
much to stand in their way. 
I ask you, do not send this message. 
Let’s unite against extremism, not 
with it. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, about a 
month ago, 3 weeks ago, I suspended 
my social media accounts, my personal 
social media accounts. I did so because 
social media is pretty much consuming 
the way we govern. 
And I will just say, why are we gov-
erning by sound bite? Why are we gov-
erning by looking back at what some-
body said on Twitter or Facebook? 
This is a body that is called under 
the Constitution to meet on the floor 
of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives—not by proxy, by the

way—and to sit here and debate, and to 
debate the important issues of the day. 
A few weeks ago, I was proud to 
stand with my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to condemn what occurred 
on January 6. I joined with some of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to disagree on the issue of objections. 
And then to have a Member on the 
other side of the aisle attack my 
former boss and friend, Senator TED 
CRUZ, and basically accuse him of 
being an attempted murderer? I asked 
that that statement be stricken and 
there be an apology for it. I didn’t ask 
that somebody be stripped from their 
committeeships. I didn’t ask that they 
be censured. I tried to engage with that 
colleague—have and will. And then this 
last weekend, I had a statement di-
rected at me, accusing me of the worst 
kind of horrific act. 
Where is this body going to go, ladies 
and gentlemen? Now, we are here in 
the first few weeks of this Congress at-
tacking a freshman Member, who is ad-
dressing the concerns of statements 
that I take issue with, that a number 
of my colleagues on this side of the 
aisle take issue with, and you are going 
to unilaterally strip her of a com-
mittee assignment. 
This is not the people’s House any-
more. I made this statement yesterday 
on the budget reconciliation. 
I had a great conversation with the 
distinguished majority leader today 
about our need to restore regular 
order. And I would just ask my col-
leagues that we remove this. 
I made a motion to adjourn because 
we shouldn’t be wasting the time of 
this body attacking a Member of this 
body. This will not end well. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to make 
clear that this is not an action by one 
party. This is a House resolution. 
Today, all of us will be voting. 
And the Constitution couldn’t be 
clearer. Article I, Section 5 vests the 
House with the authority, independent 
of the Ethics Committee, to discipline 
a Member. As a sanction for such be-
havior, the House may limit any right, 
power, privilege, or immunity of that 
Member. I am sure my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are aware of 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS). 
Ms. 
WILLIAMS 
of 
Georgia. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
resolution to remove Congresswoman 
MARJORIE
TAYLOR
GREENE
from her 
committee assignments. 
Her words and actions tout dangerous 
and deadly QAnon conspiracy theories, 
threaten our national security, and put 
the lives of every person at risk. 
On January 6, we witnessed what can 
happen when our leaders spread base-
less conspiracy theories and spew vio-
lent rhetoric that echoes the same call 
to violence that resulted in a domestic 
terrorist attack on the United States 
Capitol. 
We can’t control what Representa-
tive GREENE does and says, but we can 
control how we operate as a governing 
body that holds its officials account-
able. 
I am particularly concerned about 
her appointment to the Education and 
Labor Committee, which not only has 
oversight of the education of our chil-
dren, but also has the responsibility to 
ensure students have safe environ-
ments to learn. 
I watched in horror at the footage of 
Representative 
GREENE
berating 
a 
Parkland shooting survivor, a teenager 
who came to Capitol Hill seeking help 
from lawmakers to put an end to mass 
shootings 
and 
prevent 
other 
high 
school students from having to witness 
the senseless murder of their class-
mates and teachers. 
This is personal for me. As a mom of 
my Carter, who just started kinder-
garten, and as a survivor of a school 
shooting my senior year of high school 
that claimed the life of a classmate, I 
still live with that trauma today. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle say they disapprove of Rep-
resentative GREENE’s actions. However, 
disapproval 
without 
action 
means 
nothing. 
This is about doing what is right. As 
Dr. King stated, it is never the wrong 
time to do the right thing. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this is 
personal to me. I have dedicated so 
much of my adult life to the Constitu-
tion of the United States. 
If you go back to 1884—it has been 
cited for about 80 or 100 years even— 
the Select Committee back in 1884 was 
taking up the issue of a Member of 
Congress being expelled. The com-
mittee said that because the conduct 
was committed during an earlier Con-
gress: It must be said that with prac-
tical uniformity the precedents in such 
cases are to the effect that the House 
will not expel a Member for reprehen-
sible action prior to the election of a 
Member, not even for conviction of an 
offense. That has been so frequently de-
cided in the House that it is no longer 
a matter of dispute. 
And, yes, that was expelling from the 
House, but you are wanting to expel a 
Member from being a full Member, as 
she was elected to do. 
Now, James Madison—hopefully, that 
name rings a bell—said if the legisla-
ture 
could 
regulate 
those—talking 
about 
qualifications—which 
in 
this 
case would mean you have to meet our 
qualifications for what you say before 
you are a Member of Congress or you 
don’t come in. He said if you could reg-
ulate those qualifications, ‘‘it can by 
degrees subvert the Constitution. A Re-
public may be converted into an aris-
tocracy or oligarchy as well by lim-
iting the number capable of being 
elected.’’ Qualifications founded on ar-
tificial distinctions may be devised by 
the stronger party in order to keep out 
partisans of a weaker party. 
This is so dangerous. Never in the 
history of the Congress has a majority 
party taken such fanatical action to 
remove somebody from the other party 
from committees. This is unprece-
dented. 
We had a Senator named Biden who 
looked at a Ku Klux Klan recruiter as 
a mentor and friend, and you punished 
him by inaugurating him as President. 
Look, please, I know there are so 
many good, decent Democrats. We dis-
agree on a lot of things, but as a mat-
ter of conscience—you talk about con-
science. You have to know if you do 
this, just like Democrats objecting to 
electors and then coming around later 
and 
saying, 
oh, 
you 
are 
disenfranchising voters. Look, if you 
do this, you know the day will come 
when Republicans will not like some-
thing you said and start removing you 
from committees. This is not a road to 
go down. 
I beg you, please, don’t start this 
precedent. It won’t end well for either 
party. But we will follow your lead if 
you lead. 
I am imploring you, do the right 
thing. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, after dec-
ades of living through discrimination 
from our government, my older Black 
neighbors in my district finally began 
having a sense of hope that a new gen-
eration of elected leaders is here. 
Recently, however, those same neigh-
bors have told me they began to feel 
that fear again because of what is hap-
pening here in this Chamber. In today’s 
Republican Party, MARJORIE
TAYLOR 
GREENE’s world views are violent, anti- 
Black, racist, Islamophobic, and anti- 
Semitic, and they are condoned. 
Every single day that goes by with-
out outright condemnation from every 
single one of her Republican col-
leagues, without consequences for her 
extremist views, is an outright en-
dorsement of white supremacy. We owe 
it to our residents who have been vic-
tim of these very hateful views to take 
action. 
When Members like MARJORIE TAY-
LOR GREENE proudly claim that Mus-
lims shouldn’t be allowed in this Con-
gress, or that 9/11 attacks were fake, or 
that the Speaker of the House should 
be 
executed, 
there 
must 
be 
con-
sequences. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, it is good to 
be here today, but what I feel and what 
I believe as I am listening and I am 
hearing the debate is this is not really 
about words said by Mrs. GREENE be-
fore she was ever elected overwhelm-
ingly in her district. 
If it was about language and that we 
were disciplining because of language,

we would have disciplined somebody 
else on this side, on the Democrat’s 
side, who said: ‘‘Israel has hypnotized 
the world. May Allah awaken the peo-
ple and help them see the evildoings of 
Israel.’’ ‘‘It is all about the Benjamins, 
baby.’’ 
That would invoke some discipline, I 
would have thought. 
How about this one comparing Jew-
ish Israeli settlers to termites. That 
guy didn’t get disciplined. He is still on 
the committees I sit on. He said: There 
has been a steady stream, almost like 
termites can get into a residence and 
eat. And before you know that, you 
have been eaten up, and you fall in on 
yourself. 
b 1715 
It goes on and it goes on. The Speak-
er of this House has said that Repub-
licans are enemies of the state. All of 
these incite violence. All of these de-
mean. All of these dehumanize. All of 
these are statements that just should 
not be accepted, but they were accept-
ed. There was no condemnation. And as 
the last speaker just said, no con-
demnation is an endorsement. So I 
guess there is endorsement from all of 
them on those statements. 
So here today you are doing some-
thing that is unprecedented. You are 
taking somebody for things she said be-
fore she got into this body, and you are 
saying that we are going to control the 
minority choice of committee assign-
ments. This has never happened before, 
but here it goes. I am afraid it is going 
to cascade, because that is not the way 
we should do this. You can’t take away 
the rights of the minority leader and 
the minority conference. That is the 
problem that we have here. 
No one endorses what Mrs. GREENE 
said, but we endorse her election and 
the right of the leader to make her 
committee assignments and not to 
have those be taken away by the ma-
jority. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of H. Res. 72, to remove 
MARJORIE
TAYLOR
GREENE
from her 
committee post. 
Congresswoman GREENE is part of the 
cult conspiracy mindset that has in-
fected segments of our American soci-
ety and is ripping our Nation apart. 
The wild conspiracy theories that 
QAnoners invent are, in essence, out-
rageous lies. Even more alarming, they 
are lies backed by the threat of vio-
lence. 
Yes, Representative GREENE and her 
QAnon adherents are ready to defend 
their deranged lies with violence. They 
have expressed a desire to assassinate 
Speaker PELOSI and to publicly execute 
those who disagree with their malig-
nant lies. They have even expressed a 
passionate desire to overthrow our con-
stitutional democracy. 
Congresswoman GREENE indicated be-
fore last year’s election that, if Donald 
Trump lost, Americans may need to re-
claim freedom with the price of blood. 
MARJORIE GREENE has harassed a sur-
vivor of the Marjory Stoneman Doug-
las High School shooting, calling him a 
coward and proclaiming the massacre 
was staged as a plot to pass more gun 
laws. 
Yet her Republican colleagues be-
lieve she has the proper credentials and 
principles to serve on the Education 
and Labor Committee. Some will play 
both sides, but that is a false equiva-
lence. 
I think it is clear that we need to 
draw the line at Jewish space lasers 
and calling for political assassinations, 
not policy differences. At least with 
one xenophobic racist, both sides were 
able to put country over party. The 
party of Honest Abe can no longer be 
honest with itself. 
MARJORIE GREENE and her fellow con-
spiracy theorists have saturated our 
Nation with lies. It is time to turn the 
tables and start talking about truth for 
a change. 
Gandhi liked to say: ‘‘Even if you are 
a minority of one, the truth is the 
truth.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to join 
in defending truth. Stand up for truth 
even if you are alone. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, at the di-
rection of the narrow Democrat major-
ity, we are here today standing in judg-
ment over a newly elected colleague of 
ours for things said as a private citizen 
that have since been retracted. 
Meanwhile, some colleagues have en-
gaged in anti-American, anti-Semitic 
tropes and commentary before and 
after their elections to Congress. Other 
colleagues have incited and called for 
violence across the country the day 
Donald Trump became President, and 
still encourage violence against him 
and those who support the Republican 
Party, not to mention other dangerous 
words that have been harmful to the 
security of our Nation. 
But, Mr. Speaker, none of those are 
in question. Those Members never saw 
any condemnation and, in this Demo-
crat majority, they never will. 
I went to the Rules Committee yes-
terday, 
strongly 
opposing 
to 
this 
course of action, with a suggestion to 
correct this blatant double standard, 
should it move forward. I was told by 
the chairman that, ‘‘We don’t share the 
same values,’’ because I was demanding 
that we prioritize accountability for 
members of his party and their com-
ments and dangerous rhetoric carried 
out while in office before we address 
Representative GREENE’s commentary 
made before she was elected. 
Perhaps the chairman is right. My 
values are that anyone who blatantly 
calls for violence against Conserv-
atives; praises deadly antifa riots; en-
dangers Americans; encourages the de-
struction of our ally Israel; and, per-
haps worst of all, dismisses the signifi-
cance of 9/11 has no business serving in 
the House of Representatives. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, no one in 
Congress should be more grateful than 
the Democrat majority that eliminated 
our motion to recommit last month 
and the Democrat members who have 
made 
these 
inflammatory 
remarks 
over the years, because I have no doubt 
that a motion by Republicans to oust 
those Representatives would have suc-
ceeded with very strong bipartisan sup-
port. By shattering this precedent 
today, perhaps this majority has set in 
motion a future majority’s obligation 
to do so. 
If my Democrat colleagues are at-
tempting to take the speck out of our 
eye, I encourage them to also take the 
log out of their own eyes. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, this is not 
about one Member. This is about who 
we are as a body and what we are as a 
democracy. This is about whether it is 
acceptable to cheer on and encourage 
an 
insurrection 
against 
our 
basic 
democratic processes. This is about 
whether it is okay to demand Members 
swear in on a Bible of a religion they 
do not practice. This is about whether 
it is okay to hold an assault rifle next 
to Members’ heads in a campaign ad 
and incite death threats against them. 
This is about whether it is okay to en-
courage the murder of the Speaker of 
the House. 
As a survivor of civil conflict and 
civil war, I know political violence and 
political rhetoric does not go away on 
its own. This is about whether or not 
we will continue to be a peaceful and 
functioning democracy. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to have taken my oath on 
that Bible, which I do follow and try to 
live my life after. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to object to 
the left’s pattern of teaming up with 
the mainstream media to try to stifle 
the voices of conservatives. 
First, it was 4 years of trying to re-
move President Trump. Today, it is 
trying to strip my friend, MARJORIE 
TAYLOR GREENE, of her committee as-
signments. It is only a matter of time 
until they start coming after everyday 
Americans. 
We travel down a dangerous road 
today when the majority party is 
threatening to make committee as-
signments for the minority. Mr. Speak-
er, my friends across the aisle, as we 
have seen and as we have just heard 
from one, certainly have no shortage of 
members who have expressed very of-
fensive opinions after they were elect-
ed to this body. 
Democrats are not looking to lower 
the temperature or deliver results for 
the American people. Their goal is to 
cause chaos and divide our country so

February 4, 2021 
they can continue to expand their rad-
ical left agenda until they have si-
lenced all opposing viewpoints. 
Democrats control the House, the 
Senate, and the White House. If they 
wanted to deliver results to the Amer-
ican people, they could do it. But their 
agenda is clear: they don’t want to gov-
ern. They want to rule and clamp down 
on any dissent to their radical agenda. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis 
and I rise in defense of our Nation’s 
schoolchildren. I cannot sit idly by and 
allow white supremacy and hatred to 
have decisionmaking power over our 
students’ futures. 
To my Republican colleagues: let his-
tory remember what you did in this 
moment. A prerequisite for appoint-
ment to these committees and for all 
that we do must be that you love and 
represent all people. 
We owe it to our children and we owe 
it to their parents to have a House 
Education and Labor Committee that 
is committed to fighting for a country 
where all children have an equitable 
education in an intentionally anti-rac-
ist society. Let me say that again: an 
intentionally anti-racist society. 
From the Ferguson-Florissant school 
district in St. Louis to the Normandy, 
Hazelwood, Riverview Gardens, Jen-
nings, and University City school dis-
tricts, to St. Louis Public Schools, all 
of our school districts deserve better. 
Harris-Stowe State University, Univer-
sity of Missouri-St. Louis, our tech and 
trade schools, St. Louis University, 
and Washington University deserve 
better. 
Our teachers, our custodial workers, 
and our cafeteria workers deserve bet-
ter. 
Our students who don’t have a roof to 
sleep under at night, our students who 
don’t have running water at home, our 
students who don’t have enough to eat 
deserve better. 
Those living with student debt and 
those who desire to go to college de-
serve better. 
Our parents deserve better. 
We cannot build an equitable, anti- 
racist education system if a seated 
House Education and Labor Committee 
member incites violence through the 
perpetuation of racist lies in an at-
tempt to overturn an election. We can-
not build an equitable, anti-racist soci-
ety if a Member of Congress endorses 
white supremacy. We need to strip 
them of their committee assignments. 
And then we must pass our resolution, 
H. Res. 25, to investigate and expel 
them. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
the hypocrisy here is an outrage. My 
fellow 
Georgian, 
Congresswoman 
GREENE, stood right here in this House 
and took full responsibility for her 
statements. That is more than we can 
say for any of the many in this Cham-
ber who have made outrageous, hate- 
filled, and vile statements and com-
ments over the past years—and recent 
months, in particular. 
For example, a Democrat member of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
has repeatedly made blatant anti-Se-
mitic statements. She still holds her 
position. 
The Democratic chairwoman of the 
House Financial Services Committee 
encouraged supporters to aggressively 
assault anyone who supported Presi-
dent Trump. She still holds her posi-
tion. 
The Speaker of the House has called 
Republicans enemies of the state. She 
still has her position. 
While we watch cities in flames, busi-
nesses being destroyed, officers killed, 
and civilians attacked, a member of 
the majority party called for further 
unrest in the streets. She still has her 
position. 
I have got four pages of similar com-
ments, and this is by no means exhaus-
tive. Inflammatory rhetoric around 
here has become commonplace, unfor-
tunately, and Members of this House 
have absolutely crossed the line by 
calling for violence and making other 
similar remarks. The majority refuses 
to hold its own members accountable. 
This is the zenith of hypocrisy and in-
justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on and urge our 
Members to oppose this resolution. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, it is a 
shame that we must use precious time 
on the floor of the people’s House to 
address the inflammatory remarks of 
Member MARJORIE
TAYLOR
GREENE. 
But just as we are in the midst of three 
crises of the coronavirus, the economic 
distress, and social injustice, we must 
also act against a crisis of extremism 
and unhinged conspiracy theories. 
Disturbing and dangerous words and 
actions like those we have heard and 
seen from this individual in this House 
are below the dignity of a Member of 
Congress. And if they did not stop when 
we were all sworn in, then, if anything, 
these backward views gained a national 
platform. 
Well, I stand here to tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, I will stand up to bullies who 
threaten students and threaten and 
celebrate violence towards our Speaker 
and our colleagues. Today, as the con-
science of the Congress, it is important 
that we take this step to affirm that 
conspiracy theories and outrageous lies 
have no place in the Congress and no 
place in the people’s House. No place. 
No place. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, here we 
sit on this fourth day of February and, 
here we go, we have a pandemic that is 
shutting down businesses all across 
this country. We have schools shut 
down, causing havoc with our children. 
We have a national debt of over $30 
trillion. We have seniors wondering if 
their Social Security payment will be 
suspended due to anticipated bank-
ruptcy. We have a Democratic Party 
focusing today and yesterday on by-
passing the legislative process and 
issuing executive orders defunding our 
police departments, destroying our en-
ergy independence by shutting off our 
production of oil and gas, allowing men 
to identify as women and going to any 
bathroom of choice. 
And what is the majority, who are 
spending the hard-earned tax dollars, 
doing today? 
Attempting to throw a member of 
our party, who was duly elected, be-
cause of something purportedly to have 
been said before she got into Congress. 
Here is what I ask: Throw us all off 
the committees. Throw all of us off. 
God, I hope the American people see 
what you are doing and that this is 
nothing more than an abuse of power 
by a party drunk with power. 
b 1730 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mrs. 
HAYES). 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this resolution on 
behalf of my constituents in Connecti-
cut’s Fifth District. 
The statements made by the Rep-
resentative from Georgia have ampli-
fied horrific and deeply dishonest rhet-
oric and empowered and mainstreamed 
fringe conspiracy theories about school 
shootings. Giving any Member the 
platform to spread dangerous rhetoric 
only rewards and normalizes this be-
havior, 
places 
already 
vulnerable 
groups 
in 
danger, 
and 
further 
traumatizes survivors. 
There is no place in this House for a 
Member that trivializes these events or 
refuses to publicly disavow her own 
words or apologize to those affected. 
Mr. Speaker, there are men and 
women on both sides of the aisle whom 
I strongly disagree with, colleagues 
who have made statements that have 
deeply offended me. Yet, I have never 
believed we should remove them from 
committees on this body. 
But today is different. We are forced 
to make this motion, not because of a 
disagreement in values or opinions, but 
because the Republican Conference has 
refused to take any actions addressing 
dangerous comments made by a Mem-
ber, comments which have no place in 
common discourse and cannot be given 
a platform to be amplified. 
While I remain respectful of the vot-
ers in Georgia, we have a responsibility 
as a body to hold our own Members ac-
countable, and I would vote in the 
same way if a member of my own cau-
cus had committed the same infrac-
tions. 
No Member of Congress should pro-
mote conspiracy theories or sow doubt 
about the validity of tragic mass cas-
ualty events like Sandy Hook, Park-
land, and others. No parent should ever

have to invite a Member of Congress to 
visit their child’s grave or touch the 
bullet-riddled clothing that their child 
wore to prove that their death actually 
happened. 
Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of this 
House always tells Members to vote 
our district. Today, I vote as an act of 
conscience in defense of my district. I 
vote for the babies who left for school 
8 years ago and never returned home, 
and the teachers who died trying to 
protect them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Mrs. HAYES. Today, I will vote for 
millions of educators who stand brave-
ly before students while they lead 
lockdown drills and whisper quietly to 
them while sheltering in place that 
school is still safe. 
I will vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution 
for the parents and the communities 
who want real debate that produces 
real solutions for keeping schools and 
communities safe. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. SPARTZ), my new 
colleague. 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, as some-
one who grew up in a communist coun-
try where people were punished for ex-
pressing their opinions, I have an enor-
mous 
appreciation 
for 
our 
First 
Amendment rights. This is a core prin-
ciple our Nation was founded on. 
I might not like many things that 
my colleagues from both parties have 
to say. Sometimes I think they are 
crazy things, but I will still vigorously 
defend their First Amendment rights 
and rights of free speech, especially 
what they have said as private individ-
uals before. The voters will decide if 
they are the right representative for 
them. 
It is a slippery slope to start policing 
people’s opinions, and our Congress 
will start resembling a communist po-
litburo if we are not careful. I would 
really like my colleagues to think be-
fore they make this vote. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), my 
friend and neighbor. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard a lot here 
today so, in closing, let me remind my 
colleagues that we were sent here, not 
only to uphold the Constitution, but to 
uphold the standard of conduct. 
Let me share with you what should 
have happened. What should have hap-
pened is some remorse for the pain that 
the gentlewoman from Georgia has 
caused and to acknowledge that pain, 
the damage that she has caused, the vi-
olence she has advocated. 
I would have hoped that she would 
have realized, like so many of us have, 
the awe and gravity of serving in this 
institution and that, despite all the 
harm that the words and actions she 
has taken have caused, that now that 
she is a Member of this body, she truly 
understands and is sorry she stalked 
the teenager who was a victim of a 
mass shooting; sorry that she actually 
suggested that our leader of the House 
of Representatives should meet a bullet 
as her end; sorry that she suggested 
that President Obama should have his 
life snuffed out. 
But none of that happened, and that 
is why she has forfeited the right to 
serve on committees in this House of 
Representatives. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose this unprecedented 
power grab orchestrated by the Demo-
crats. 
Much has been said about what my 
colleague from Georgia has spoken of 
in her past, but the past is past. I do 
not believe Congress has jurisdiction to 
re-litigate what a Member of this body 
said before they took their solemn oath 
of office. That is an issue to be adju-
dicated by her constituents at the bal-
lot box in the 14th District of Georgia, 
not here in Congress. 
Without question, this body is put-
ting itself on an extremely dangerous 
path, a path that opens the door to al-
lowing the majority party to strip the 
minority party members of their com-
mittees, based on statements made or 
beliefs held before holding office. 
It is clear the resolution before us is 
not about my colleague; it is about 
Democrats seizing upon an opportunity 
to further suppress the rights of the 
minority party, to silence a bold mem-
ber of the opposition, and to thereby 
further their socialist agenda. 
Members of Congress have a duty to 
hold themselves to the highest stand-
ards, and I know Marjorie is doing just 
that. I expect no less from my Demo-
cratic colleagues, which is why this 
resolution must not pass. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the distinguished majority leader of 
the House of Representatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
sad day and a difficult day for the 
House of Representatives and for our 
country. I have had the great honor of 
serving this body for 40 years and in 
that time, I have never encountered a 
situation like the one before us now, 
where a Member has made such vile 
and hurtful statements, engaged in the 
harassment 
of 
colleagues, 
and 
ex-
pressed support for political violence. 
None of us should take any pleasure in 
what we must do today. 
But to do nothing would be an abdi-
cation of our moral responsibility to 
our colleagues, to the House, to our 
values, to the truth, and to our coun-
try. 
A great forebear of legislators, Ed-
mund Burke, famously declared: ‘‘The 
only thing necessary for the triumph of 
evil is for good men to do nothing.’’ 
Yesterday, 
the 
Republican 
Con-
ference chose to do nothing, so today, 
the House must do something. 
I have heard some condemnation 
from across the aisle of the contents of 
Representative GREENE’s statements. 
Some have condemned the white su-
premacist and anti-Semitic things she 
said and posted online. Some have con-
demned 
the 
falsehoods 
she 
shared 
about 9/11 and the horrific school 
shootings. 
But I have heard little from Repub-
licans about the horrific statements 
made 
by 
their 
colleague 
making 
threats of violence against Democratic 
elected officials and her threatening 
conduct toward Representative BUSH 
and others. 
Indeed, Mr. Speaker, there seems to 
be much silence when it comes to her 
incitement of political violence. 
In The Washington Post yesterday, 
columnist Greg Sargent wrote: 
Whatever 
happens 
to 
Representative 
GREENE, the truth is unavoidable: Repub-
licans have yet to offer a clear and unambig-
uous declaration that political violence is 
unacceptable and has no place in their ranks. 
And I have heard too much about 
process and not enough about account-
ability. 
No Member ought to be permitted to 
engage in the kind of behavior that 
Representative GREENE has and face 
zero consequences. This vote can be a 
first step in correcting the error of 
those who, so far, have chosen to do 
nothing. 
A short while ago, Representative 
GREENE came to this floor to defend 
her indefensible conduct. I heard no 
apology. 
She claimed that we are here today 
only because of some things she wrote 
online before she ever ran for Congress, 
as if one’s moral slate is wiped clean 
when one becomes a candidate for of-
fice. 
Regardless, the conduct we are judg-
ing today continued to occur even after 
Representative GREENE became a can-
didate, and even after she was elected. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
look at this image. 
I heard about motherhood today. 
Two of those women between them 
have six children. They are mothers. 
One of them does not have children, 
and she has come to this body asking 
for more housing for people, for more 
healthcare for people, for more income 
for people. How awful. 
And they are not the Squad. They are 
Ilhan, they are Alexandria, and they 
are Rashida. They are people. They are 
our colleagues. 
And yes, you may have disagree-
ments, but I don’t know anybody, in-
cluding STEVE KING, who you precluded 
from going on committees for much 
less—and this is an AR–15 in the hands 
of Mrs. GREENE. This was on Facebook 
just a few months ago. 
Is that a message of peace and rec-
onciliation and peaceful democratic 
dialogue—The Squad’s worst enemy, 
AR–15 in hand.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H356 
February 4, 2021 
I have never ever seen that before. Is 
this a precedent-setting event? It is, 
because the conduct, the tweeting, the 
QAnon association—I heard the dis-
avow of QAnon. I learned more. 
b 1745 
AR–15, ‘‘Squad’s Worst Nightmare.’’ 
Is that what it was intended to do, that 
each one of these ladies would have a 
nightmare about somebody with a gun, 
an AR–15 that can carry a clip of up to 
60 bullets? 
I urge my colleagues to look at that 
image and tell me what message you 
think it sends. 
Here she is, armed with a deadly as-
sault rifle, pointing it toward three 
Democratic Members. Now, the pic-
tures were put together, you under-
stand. They were not present; I under-
stand that. And she captioned it 
‘‘Squad’s Worst Nightmare.’’ 
Yes, some people are having night-
mares and fear. And some people who 
wanted to give other people nightmares 
committed sedition and broke into the 
House of Representatives and tried to 
stop us from electing a President of the 
United States. 
These three faces are real people. 
They are three reasons we are here. 
But there are many other reasons we 
are here today. 
In 2019, during the same election 
cycle in which she ran, she showed sup-
port for comments online that the 
quickest 
way 
to 
remove 
Speaker 
PELOSI from power would be ‘‘a bullet 
to the head.’’ Did any of you hear 
Steve King say anything like that? 
You removed him from all of his com-
mittees. 
But as I said, you did nothing. As a 
matter of fact, you gave a standing 
ovation, as I understand. I wasn’t 
there. What message does that send? 
What message does it send to have a 
standing ovation to give these three 
women nightmares? 
Indisputably, these are clear threats 
to commit or incite political violence, 
not from years ago but just months 
ago. Imagine the pain that these Mem-
bers’ families must be experiencing 
when they see pictures like this one. 
Imagine what their children think 
when they know their loved ones are 
walking the Halls of Congress and may 
encounter harassment, as it happened 
to Representative BUSH? 
So I ask my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, when they take this 
vote, imagine your faces on this poster. 
Imagine it is a Democrat with an AR– 
15. Imagine what your response would 
be. Would you think that that person 
ought to be held accountable? 
But when acquiescence to the sugges-
tion of violence of any kind is allowed 
to go unchecked, it is a cancer that 
metastasizes on the body politic of our 
Nation, as we saw just a few days ago 
on January 6. 
Cancer, that is how Senate Repub-
lican Leader MCCONNELL described it. 
He said: ‘‘Loony lies and conspiracy 
theories are cancer for the Republican 
Party and our country.’’ Should we 
stand silent in the face of that kind of 
activity? 
He continued: ‘‘Somebody who has 
suggested that perhaps no airplane hit 
the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying 
school shootings were pre-staged, and 
that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.’s air-
plane is not living in reality.’’ 
That is not me talking. That is not a 
Democrat talking. That is Senator 
MCCONNELL. 
‘‘This has nothing to do with the 
challenges facing American families or 
the robust debates on substance that 
can strengthen our party.’’ 
My colleagues across the aisle have 
an opportunity today to reclaim their 
party from the dangerous cancer of 
QAnon and violent conspiracy theories 
that promote and have demonstrably 
resulted in sedition and insurrection. 
Senator 
ROMNEY—you 
remember 
Senator ROMNEY. He was a candidate 
for President of the United States on 
the Republican ticket, nominated in 
the Republican convention. He said of 
his party this week: ‘‘I think we should 
have nothing to do with MARJORIE TAY-
LOR GREENE and think we should repu-
diate the things she said and move 
away from her.’’ ‘‘Our big tent is not 
large enough to both accommodate 
conservatives and kooks.’’ 
Not my words, his words, a Repub-
lican Member of the United States Sen-
ate. Now, he is not a big buddy of 
Trump’s, so apparently he didn’t have 
to do what Trump suggested he do. 
And Senator ERNST, a conservative 
woman from Iowa: ‘‘She doesn’t rep-
resent the party. I don’t want her to be 
the face of our party. I think this is a 
great time for us to really talk about 
what we want to see in the upcoming 
years and continue to build. We don’t 
need people that are promoting vio-
lence or anything like that.’’ That is a 
Republican conservative Senator. 
Republican Senator and former Gov-
ernor of Florida RICK SCOTT said—a 
conservative 
Republican 
Senator— 
‘‘That is not what the Republican 
Party stands for.’’ 
Let me suggest to you, if it is not, 
vote with us. Vote with the House, not 
Democrats. Vote with the House of 
Representatives. Vote with good order 
and peace. 
Furthermore, Senator YOUNG
from 
Indiana said: ‘‘There ought to be no 
place’’ in the Republican Party for the 
kind of views espoused by Representa-
tive GREENE. 
That is what McCarthy said when 
you kicked King off of all his commit-
tees. This is not something you haven’t 
done. However, sadly, you left it to us 
to do your job. 
Representative COLE called her state-
ments ‘‘extraordinarily disturbing.’’ He 
said that yesterday; it is an old quote. 
And Senator THUNE asked his fellow 
Republicans in the House: ‘‘Do they 
want to be the party of limited govern-
ment’’—I think the answer to that is 
yes—‘‘or do they want to be the party 
of conspiracy theories and QAnon?’’ 
Furthermore, Senator YOUNG
from 
Indiana said: ‘‘There ought to be no 
place’’ in the Republican Party for the 
kind of views espoused by Representa-
tive GREENE. 
That is what your Republican col-
leagues have said. This is not partisan. 
This is about principle. 
And you can shake your head as 
much as you want. This is not about 
party. It is about whether or not you 
will vote for decency and truth, not the 
Members’ worst nightmare. 
I hope we can do it together, all of 
us, embracing our humanity and our 
basic adherence to the Constitution. 
Edmund Burke, who I quoted earlier, 
said: The only thing necessary for evil 
to triumph is for good men to do noth-
ing. 
Let us not do nothing. 
I often share another passage shared 
so long ago by Edmund Burke when a 
new Member arrives to serve in the 
House. It concerns a duty a representa-
tive has to his or her constituents. His 
conclusion on that matter is that we 
owe them our unbiased opinion, mature 
judgment, and enlightened sense of 
conscience. 
What does your conscience tell you 
to do in light of this kind of assertion? 
Nothing? 
Burke told his own constituents that 
these virtues of a representative ‘‘does 
not derive from your pleasure,’’ ‘‘nor 
from the law and the Constitution. 
They are a trust from providence, for 
the abuse of which’’ you are ‘‘deeply 
answerable. Your representative owes 
you, not his industry only, but his 
judgment, and he betrays, instead of 
serving you, if he sacrifices it to your 
opinion.’’ 
This is not about polling. This is not 
about your base. This is about your 
conscience and your moral judgment. 
In other words, each of us ought to 
look inside our hearts to the answer 
that we know is right and is best for 
the House and for our country. 
If the Republican Party for less toxic 
language took committee assignments 
away from Steve King, should they do 
less in this instance? 
There is no doubt that if somebody 
came to the Congress and had said, be-
fore they came to the Congress, ‘‘I am 
for violent revolution against the Gov-
ernment of the United States of Amer-
ica,’’ your party would say that is not 
somebody we want to be associated 
with. 
That is not what she said; I do not as-
sert that. But should we do less than 
you did for Steve King for far less toxic 
language? 
Let us not do nothing. Mr. Speaker, 
let us do the right thing. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, today is 
really about one party single-handedly 
canceling a Member of the other party 
because of something said before that 
Member was even elected. 
This isn’t about agreeing or dis-
agreeing with the comments. This is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H357 
February 4, 2021 
about Democrats abusing their power 
and using it to cancel. 
This sets a very dangerous precedent. 
There are Members across the aisle 
who have said alarming things re-
cently. They have made anti-Semitic 
comments repeatedly. They have made 
anti-American comments repeatedly. 
And they have made comments threat-
ening violence repeatedly. 
Cancel culture should not take over 
our country. Cancel culture should not 
take over our tech platforms. And can-
cel culture certainly should not take 
over the House of Representatives. 
We need to let the gentlewoman from 
Georgia serve and to allow her con-
stituents to judge her performance at 
the ballot box. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I absolutely reject rac-
ism, anti-Semitism, and bigotry, as I 
said earlier. I condemn conspiracy 
theories and calls for violence. I do not 
in any way condone these reprehensible 
views. 
Sadly, though, here we are today to 
effectuate another partisan power grab. 
The Democratic majority has taken 
unprecedented steps to marginalize Re-
publicans just because we have not 
done what they want us to do, and that 
is wrong. 
There is a reason that neither party 
holds a majority on the Ethics Com-
mittee, and the reason is to avoid one 
party or the other weaponizing the 
committee’s purpose for use in polit-
ical and partisan fashion. 
The majority should withdraw this 
resolution and, if it chooses, pursue 
this matter properly through the Eth-
ics Committee. 
If the resolution is not withdrawn, 
then I will vote ‘‘no’’ and hope at some 
point the Ethics Committee will again 
be used to serve this body as intended. 
Our colleagues deserve better, and 
the House, as an institution, deserves 
better. I ask my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just address 
some of what we have heard today. 
First, we have heard the argument 
made by our colleagues that this is 
something that should go to the Ethics 
Committee, despite the fact that we 
have the authority to be here today to 
tackle something that our friends 
should have tackled. 
But then they turn around and say 
that the Ethics Committee doesn’t 
have jurisdiction for anything that has 
been said before a Member is elected, 
thereby creating a loop that will result 
in no accountability, zero account-
ability, for any of the horrific sayings, 
any of the horrific actions that have 
been 
promoted 
by 
Representative 
GREENE on social media and in her 
words. 
We also heard that what we are doing 
here risks deepening dangerous divi-
sions. The dangerous divisions that 
exist in our country resulted in an at-
tack on this Capitol, putting all of our 
lives at risk. We are trying to stop the 
divisions in our country by not giving 
a platform to the kinds of conspiracy 
theories that helped to inflame them. 
We heard that this is cynical and 
hypocritical. Mr. Speaker, is there any-
thing more cynical and hypocritical 
than to be told on the floor of this 
House that the minority leader was 
prepared to take Mrs. GREENE off the 
committee, not because it was the 
right thing to do, but because it was a 
political decision he was willing to 
consider? 
Finally, we heard that Representa-
tive GREENE has apologized for this. 
She came to the floor today. She ac-
knowledged that 9/11 happened; she ac-
knowledged that school shootings are 
real; and she acknowledged that she 
learned some things about QAnon that 
she didn’t know before. 
b 1800 
There was no apology. There was 
nothing to address any of the pain and 
hurt that she has done to my constitu-
ents and gun violence survivors in 
every part of this country and the fam-
ilies who lost loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to be here 
today. This hateful rhetoric is in the 
real world as well, outside the Halls of 
Congress, not just here. Memories of 
the lives we have lost to gun violence 
are being forsaken by those who 
baselessly claim those tragedies were 
false flag events. Online rants about 
anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, 
and conspiracy theories have mani-
fested in real and violent acts. It is not 
a debating society that we are partici-
pating in. This has real impact, in the 
real world. 
Finally, I close with this, Mr. Speak-
er: We are worried about precedent? 
So am I. So we should all be. And the 
precedent of rewarding a Member of 
the House by giving her a platform of a 
congressional committee to amplify 
dangerous conspiracy theories is one 
we should never set. 
Leader MCCARTHY said so himself. I 
would remind my colleagues again, 2 
years ago he said: Any hatred, any ha-
tred we take action. 
Unfortunately, the only action taken 
by Republican leadership has been to 
appoint Representative GREENE to two 
powerful committees. 
This resolution condemns the prac-
tice of promoting extreme ideologies, 
conspiracy 
theories, 
and 
antigovernment rhetoric. The resolu-
tion proclaims that there is no place 
for such conduct in this Congress or in 
society. When Mrs. GREENE came to the 
floor today and compared the media to 
QAnon, it is a reminder of just how im-
portant this action is that we are about 
to take. This is why we must adopt H. 
Res. 72. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 91, the 
previous question is ordered on the res-
olution. 
The question is on adoption of the 
resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN 
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, by di-
rection of the Republican Conference, I 
send to the desk a privileged resolution 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 95 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
bers be, and are hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing committees of the House of Rep-
resentatives: 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET: Mr. Grothman 
(to rank immediately after Mr. McClintock), 
Mr. Smucker (to rank immediately after Mr. 
Grothman), Mr. Carter of Georgia (to rank 
immediately after Mr. Burgess). 
COMMITTEE ON ETHICS: Mr. Joyce of Ohio, 
Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Armstrong. 
Ms. CHENEY (during the reading). 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution be considered 
as read. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
HAYES). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from Wyo-
ming? 
There was no objection. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
FBI AGENTS DANIEL ALFIN AND 
LAURA SCHWARTZENBERGER 
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy 
heart that I rise to honor the lives of 
two fallen FBI agents, Daniel Alfin and 
Laura Schwartzenberger. 
On Tuesday morning, while executing 
a Federal warrant in a child exploi-
tation investigation, Special Agents 
Daniel 
Alfin 
and 
Laura 
Schwartzenberger were shot and killed 
in the line of duty in Sunrise, Florida. 
This was, sadly, the FBI’s deadliest 
day since the tragic events on 9/11. It 
has also been more than 30 years since 
two agents were gunned down together 
in the line of duty. They died pro-
tecting our most vulnerable citizens 
and the community they loved. 
Laura Schwartzenberger’s specialty 
was pursuing crimes against children. 
Her work with the FBI Miami Field Of-
fice’s Innocent Images National Initia-
tive led to the arrests of those involved 
in the exploitation of children and 
sextortion. She leaves behind a hus-
band and two children. 
Daniel Alfin was a veteran agent who 
led the investigation into a dark 
website called Playpen, one of the 
country’s largest child pornography op-
erations. He leaves behind a wife and 
one child. 
These were two heroes taken from us 
way too soon while trying to make our 
community a safer place to raise our 
families. We grieve their loss not only 
to the community they served but to 
the families and loved ones they leave 
behind. They made the ultimate sac-
rifice, and we will be forever grateful. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House to 
please pause for a moment of silence in 
memory and honor of these heroes who 
gave their lives protecting our chil-
dren.

RECOGNIZING DREAM LIKE DREW 
WEEK 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
am here to speak about a wonderful 
cause, Dream Like Drew, that pro-
motes awareness of a rare genetic dis-
order, cri du chat. 
Dream Like Drew is a weeklong 
event starting on May 3 where students 
can show their support by wearing 
unique socks, one high and one low. 
Cri du chat is caused by the deletion 
of genetic material on the fifth chro-
mosome that can cause delays in motor 
functions. Dream Like Drew was start-
ed by Kasey Eykyn, a teacher in south 
Jersey, in honor of her son, Drew 
Eykyn. Drew is an 8-year-old little boy 
who was diagnosed with cri du chat 
shortly after he was born. 
He lives life with a positive outlook 
and mindset that will allow him to 
achieve his dreams always. Drew is an 
inspiration to all, and Dream Like 
Drew is an amazing cause that encour-
ages a discussion on how important ac-
ceptance and inclusion is for those 
with disabilities. 
God bless him forever.

HONORING UNITED STATES 
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise with a somber spirit and a heavy 
heart to be able to celebrate the law of-
ficers, the police officers, who stood 
their ground on behalf of this citadel of 
democracy on January 6. 
Police officers were beaten, sprayed 
with mace, hit with stun guns, and

beaten with the United States flag and 
symbols of Nazism. You could see their 
valiant efforts, the Washington, D.C., 
Metropolitan Police with our own Cap-
itol Police. They stood their ground, 
being beat continuously by insurrec-
tionists and, of course, domestic ter-
rorists. 
Madam Speaker, I offer today my 
deepest appreciation for them and sym-
pathy for their brothers who were lost 
in the fight to preserve democracy. 
Yes, it was a fight because it was an at-
tack on the United States Capitol. We 
owe them a great deal of gratitude and, 
as well, admiration. 
Madam Speaker, I intend to intro-
duce a resolution that will honor all 
those who stood their ground and pro-
tected this place, Members of Congress, 
and others, and were in the midst of a 
battle where so many were hurt. I ex-
press my sympathy and concern for 
those still hospitalized. 
And I do say that it is important for 
us to say the simple words thank you. 
Thank you to the men and women of 
the United States Capitol Police, the 
Metropolitan Police Department, and, 
of course, our National Guard, and oth-
ers.

IN HONOR OF USCP BRIAN D. 
SICKNICK 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, this 
week, we had a hero lie in honor in the 
dome of the United States Capitol. 
United States Capitol Police Officer 
Brian Sicknick gave his life to protect 
the U.S. Capitol, one of our greatest 
symbols of democracy. I had the oppor-
tunity to pay my respects to Officer 
Sicknick in the Capitol rotunda, which 
is safe and secure because of his sac-
rifice and also the bravery of his fellow 
Capitol Police officers and other law 
enforcement. 
I am devastated by the loss of Officer 
Sicknick, and I want to provide my 
deepest 
condolences 
to 
Officer 
Sicknick’s family and fellow officers. 
I want each and every Capitol Police 
officer to know that I am grateful and 
appreciative of their work here that 
they do each and every day to protect 
democracy and all who work here, and 
they protect all of our constituents 
who visit.

VACCINE DISTRIBUTION 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today on behalf of the people 
of Nevada’s Third District. 
The pandemic has ravaged our econ-
omy, especially in Nevada, where the 
travel and tourism industry is the bed-
rock of our economy. 
Nevada is one of the hardest-hit 
States by this pandemic. Currently, we 
have one of the highest unemployment 
rates in the country at 9.2 percent, but 
we have an opportunity to put this 
pandemic behind us and to begin to re-
build our economy. That answer lies in 
vaccine distribution. We are doing ev-
erything we can to get vaccines to 
those who are eligible, but with limited 
resources, we are not able to get them 
out quickly enough. 
This week, we were able to work with 
Clark County Commissioner Michael 
Naft to establish a temporary vaccine 
site for the residents of Laughlin, a 
rural community on the border of Ari-
zona, California, and Nevada. Before 
this site was established, these Nevad-
ans had no vaccination options within 
an hour’s drive of their community. 
This pandemic needs to be treated 
like the crisis it is. We need to act 
swiftly and get States more funding for 
distribution. I am urging my col-
leagues: we must act quickly. We can-
not let partisan games get in the way.

RECOGNIZING LAKELAND FIRE 
CHIEF DOUG RILEY 
(Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize Lakeland Fire Chief Doug Riley 
for being named the 2020 Florida Fire 
Chief of the Year by the Florida Fire 
Chiefs’ Association. 
Riley was appointed as fire chief in 
December 2017. He has served more 
than 30 years with the Lakeland Fire 
Department, holding just about every 
position there during his tenure. 
I was privileged to serve alongside 
Chief Riley as a Lakeland city commis-
sioner and as a fellow rotarian. I have 
seen firsthand his effort to build better 
relationships with employees, staff, 
and the community. Doug Riley con-
tinues to go above and beyond to 
strengthen the fire department and its 
employees. 
On behalf of the 15th District of Flor-
ida, congratulations to Chief Doug 
Riley for earning this distinguished 
honor. 
The 
Lakeland 
community 
thanks the chief for his efforts to pro-
tect and serve us every day. 
Well done, Chief.

COVID–19 RELIEF 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to introduce the bipartisan Restoring 
Communities Left Behind Act. 
This legislation establishes a $5 bil-
lion neighborhood infrastructure stim-
ulus program at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development to 
help communities face down the dire 
COVID–19 economic crisis. 
I am grateful for the cooperation and 
leadership of Michigan Congresswoman 
RASHIDA
TLAIB
for leading this bill 
with me, and also for Chairwoman 
MAXINE WATERS for encouraging our ef-
forts. 
In addition to COVID–19, Americans 
in rural and urban areas are still suf-
fering from the effects of the 2008 Great 
Recession, decades of job washout, and 
redlining. Wall Street’s malfeasance 
resulted in African Americans alone 
losing nearly half of their accumulated 
wealth since the founding of the Re-
public. 
Nothing 
is 
more 
important 
for 
wealth creation than owning a home. 
This bill will provide a lifeline for fam-
ilies 
to 
restore 
financial 
security 
through homeownership. 
The bill is a critical job-creation pro-
gram. By investing in neighborhood in-
frastructure, we are investing in skills 
training and creating good paying jobs. 
Congress must act now to provide 
stimulus for neighborhoods to recover 
so they emerge more resilient. I look 
forward to working to include this bill 
in a larger COVID relief and recovery 
package. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this important housing recovery 
legislation.

HONORING TOMMY LEE EXLEY, 
SR. 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor the life of Tommy Lee Exley, 
Sr., who passed away on January 16. 
Tommy was a man of integrity who 
dedicated his life to serving others. In 
addition to serving his country in the 
National Guard, he was very active in 
community service. Tommy served on 
the Effingham Industrial Development 
Board and the Effingham Hospital 
Board for a number of years. 
He was also an active member of the 
Lions Club, The American Legion, Sun-
rise Rotary Club. He was even presi-
dent of the Springfield Jaycees, which 
is an organization that identifies com-
munity needs and provides solutions by 
planning 
and 
facilitating 
service 
projects and funding. 
Tommy graduated from the Univer-
sity of Georgia and was an avid Geor-
gia Bulldogs fan. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
wonderful family, including the love of 
his life, Bebe, as well as his friends, 
during this most difficult time.

H360 
February 4, 2021 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, 29 days ago, on January 6, 
2021, insurrectionists attacked our Cap-
itol seeking to overturn the results of 
our Nation’s election. 
Twenty-nine days ago, the glass in 
and around this very Chamber was 
shattered by gunshots, clubs, and by 
individuals seeking to restrain and 
murder Members of Congress duly 
elected to carry out the duties of their 
office. 
Twenty-nine 
days 
ago, 
Officer 
Sicknick, who just laid in honor yes-
terday in our Nation’s Capitol, was 
murdered on the steps just outside this 
hallowed floor. Two Capitol Police offi-
cers have lost their lives since, in addi-
tion to the four other people who died 
during the events of January 6. 
Twenty-nine days ago, food service 
workers, staffers, and children ran or 
hid for their lives from violence delib-
erately incited by the former President 
of the United States. 
Sadly, less than 29 days later, with 
little to no accountability for the 
bloodshed and trauma of the 6th, some 
are already demanding that we move 
on, or, worse, are attempting to mini-
mize, discredit or belittle the accounts 
of survivors. In doing so, they not only 
further harm those who were there 
that day and provide cover for those re-
sponsible, but they also send a tremen-
dously damaging message to survivors 
of trauma all across this country that 
the way to deal with trauma, violence, 
and targeting is to paper it over, mini-
mize it, and move on. 
Sadly, this is all too often what we 
hear from survivors of trauma as the 
reason why they don’t get care; that 
what they experienced wasn’t bad 
enough or too bad to talk about; or 
that they are afraid of being invali-
dated, accused of exaggeration or mak-
ing a mountain out of a mole hill. As a 
result, thousands, if not millions, deny 
themselves the care that they need and 
deserve to live better lives. 
Twenty-nine days ago, our Nation’s 
Capitol was attacked. That is the big 
story, and in that big story resides 
thousands of individual accounts just 
as valid and important as the other. 
Tonight, for this Special Order, we 
will begin to hear and commit to the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD just some of 
those many stories. I thank my col-
leagues who have bravely come forward 
today to share their accounts. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH). 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, it was 
an extraordinary day that started out 
quite beautiful for me. I live across the 
street, right next to the Supreme 
Court; and every day, almost without 
fail, there are demonstrators out on 
the Supreme Court who are peaceful. 
Some of them I agree with and some of 
them I disagree with, but it is a beau-
tiful sight to see people exercising 
their First Amendment right. 
That was a beautiful day, January 6, 
and I had time. We weren’t scheduled 
to be here in the House until about 1 
p.m. So I did something that is a privi-
lege and just a joy for those of us who 
serve here in the Capitol. I took a walk 
from the Supreme Court to the Capitol, 
down to the Washington Monument, to 
the Lincoln Memorial, and back. 
Of course, the Trump protesters at 
that point were there, as it was their 
right to be. But on the way back, I be-
came somewhat alarmed because when 
I got to the White House, it was really 
much more like a mob with many folks 
with bullhorns talking about hanging 
Mike Pence and using horrible epithets 
I can’t mention here directed towards 
NANCY PELOSI. 
As they came back toward 4th 
Street, I came in sight of—and was 
standing by—two groups of people who 
were about 70 strong and were prac-
ticing marching in military formation, 
and as they marched, they were chant-
ing, again, a word I can’t use here, F 
those people, talking about the people 
in this building. 
As Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ said, people in 
this building were workers. They were 
Capitol Police who were in this build-
ing because they had to do an hour- 
and-a-half commute to do this job to 
protect this building that belongs to 
the people of this country so they 
could then pay the bills for their fam-
ily and make that hour-and-a-half com-
mute back. It was the cafeteria work-
ers. It was everyday, hardworking, 
wonderful Americans. 
Now, at that point I still didn’t think 
anything about it because it never oc-
curred to me, with all the anger and 
hostility I saw with those groups of 
people who were marching in a forma-
tion, that when I was later sitting up 
in that gallery with many of my col-
leagues as the proceedings were taking 
place, that this building would be in-
vaded. I took it for granted that that 
just couldn’t happen. 
Of course, it did. The first sign we 
had of something amiss is when we saw 
the security people for our leadership— 
the Speaker, the minority leader, and 
our majority leader—rush them off the 
floor. We on the floor and in the gal-
lery still had no idea what was going 
on. 
Now, in retrospect, we find out the 
west side of the building was being 
breached, and one of the police officers 
said it was like a castle storming. 
Mr. MCGOVERN took the chair and 
began to continue the process of cer-
tification of the election until one of 
the Capitol Police officers told us that 
teargas had been fired, that people had 
breached the building, get out the gas 
mask, and lie on the floor. 
Then I saw Capitol Police officers 
with guns from their holsters. I looked 
at these men and women and I tried at 
that moment to imagine what was it 
like for them that they actually had to 
have a weapon out. They had families, 
they had responsibility, and whatever 
fear they may have felt, their duty was 
to protect us, and they were going to 
do it no matter what. 
How small I felt at that moment that 
because of someone who was doing 
their duty to protect me—I am no more 
worthy than any other person who 
works in this building—but that is 
their job. They were threatened. 
Then, of course, we heard the shot 
when the mob was getting in to the 
door of the Speaker’s Lobby. Then to 
get us out, they had to bring us all the 
way across this Chamber to the far 
door. We got stopped right over here 
where these two doors were being 
breached, and we heard the sound and 
saw the poles that were being pushed 
through. 
You know the rest. We are going to 
hear more stories. 
But I want to say that, in listening 
to my colleagues and experiencing it 
myself, where I had some fear, but then 
we were okay, there are two things 
that just stay with me. The first thing 
is that the tradition we have had in 
this country that is so commonplace, 
we do it every 4 years, the peaceful 
transfer of power, and how extraor-
dinary it is that we do that every 4 
years, was shattered. The second thing 
is that we saw something that allowed 
Jim Crow to thrive for over 100 years 
after the Civil War, and that was the 
use of violence as a political tactic. 
b 1915 
We now have a Capitol ringed by 
these 7-foot fences with concertina 
wire. So the trauma that we are feel-
ing, working in the sense of isolation, 
is the trauma to our democracy. Our 
goal, our responsibility is to restore 
that and not be defeated. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague, Con-
gresswoman ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-COR-
TEZ, for organizing this Special Order 
Hour this evening. 
The events of January 6 are still 
burning in the memories of all of us, as 
well as millions and millions of Ameri-
cans across the Nation; although some 
people would like to deny that it never 
happened, or sweep it under the rug, it 
continues to burn in everybody. The 
images are so aggressive that they still 
burn in the memories of millions upon 
millions of Americans. 
I started that day as I start every 
day. I came to my office at 8:30 in the 
morning. I couldn’t get through Inde-
pendence Avenue because it was shut 
down, so I came through the back of 
my office building, and I noticed that I 
was walking on the sidewalk with some 
of the protesters, unimpeded. I felt as 
though security was very lax. No one 
stopped them. They were walking right 
next to me. They were around here as 
early as 8:30 in the morning.

H361 
February 4, 2021 
I went to my office, and as I pro-
ceeded at one point to leave my office 
to come down to the floor, I was in-
formed that the Capitol had been 
breached. So we stayed in our office. 
Two police officers came to the office 
trying to escort us out and trying to 
take me to a site, a room in another of-
fice building where other Members 
were, to protect us. I decided to stay in 
my office with my team, and we locked 
ourselves in there. 
I could see from my window some of 
the protesters. You see, this assault 
against the Capitol was not just con-
centrated on the Capitol steps. It was 
everywhere, really. 
And of course, at about 8:00 at night, 
a little bit before that, I came here to 
conclude the proceedings. I felt it was 
very important that we completed our 
work for the night and not be intimi-
dated by that mob. Democracy could 
never be intimidated. 
And so I came here very early. I 
walked around as agents went around 
the Capitol and this floor securing evi-
dence. And the scene was pretty horri-
fying; furniture stuck up against the 
walls and bloodstains right outside, 
where someone was shot, was being 
mopped. 
So this is a traumatic experience for 
all of us on both sides of the aisle and 
for our Nation. It cannot be swept 
under the rug. We must get to the bot-
tom of this. We must find out if there 
were Members of this body who aided 
and abetted that angry mob, who in-
structed them of the whereabouts of 
Speaker PELOSI. 
You see, that mob came here saying 
they wanted to assassinate her and 
they wanted to hang the Vice Presi-
dent. So if anybody in this body as-
sisted someone that clearly had an in-
tent to attempt to murder someone, 
they are an accessory to that crime, 
and we must look at that evidence. 
Ultimately, we need to have the 
truth; and if we want unity in this 
body, we need the truth. If we want 
unity in America, we need the truth. 
That is what will unite us. We must 
have a deep dive, a deep investigation 
into what occurred. 
Did any of our colleagues text, email, 
or tweet the whereabouts of Speaker 
PELOSI? Did anybody tweet or share in-
formation about the labyrinth of tun-
nels and hallways in this Capitol build-
ing? They seemed to know their way 
around. 
So the truth is important for the 
unity of our Nation. This is a beautiful 
building and a temple of democracy, 
but Congress is not this building. It is 
each and every one of us and, by exten-
sion, the people that we represent. So 
an attack against us was an attack 
against our constituents. We are their 
voices here, and we must take a good 
look at what occurred. 
We must not sweep this under the 
rug. We must continue to ascertain and 
get all the facts and evidence to deter-
mine who played a pivotal role in per-
petrating that crime. Only then will we 
have unity. Only then, through truth, 
will we have peace. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentlewoman from 
New York, first of all, for her courage 
and for convening us together. And I 
might say to the gentlewoman that we 
are not doing this for ourselves. We 
have taken an oath of office. 
I have said this many times today as 
we debated a question of the status of 
a Member. We took an oath to defend 
this Nation against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic. And we realize that that 
oath is really above our own personal 
safety; that if we were called upon by 
this Nation to defend her, to defend our 
constituents, I would venture to say 
that most Members would stand by 
their constituents and this Nation. 
This should not be taken as Members 
fleeing out of fear. But it should be 
taken as an explanation and an expose’ 
of what happened in this place; how it 
was desecrated, undermined, dimin-
ished; 
how 
the 
American 
people 
watched this precious place. 
For those of us who have been here, I 
fled this place on 9/11. We were in a 
meeting, and all you could hear is a lot 
of noise. Members continuing to meet, 
not wanting to be disturbed, did not 
move until an officer or screaming 
came, and we heard the noise saying, 
we don’t know what’s going on, but get 
out. 
In that instant, we fled, and all we 
could hear was, run as fast as you can 
and hit the ground way on the other 
side near First Street and the Supreme 
Court. I could see the billowing smoke 
and the plane that had hit the Pen-
tagon. And so, that fleeing, of course, 
was because we were told to do so. 
But Members began to look for their 
staff and wanted to know what they 
could do. It was different from having a 
pandemic. It was different from the 
setting here, except for the fact that 
Members cared about what was going 
on with their constituency and their 
staff. 
Here, we were in the same way. Mem-
bers were protecting their staff in their 
offices. So I want this not to be about 
us, but the story needs to be told. 
As you have already heard, there 
were those of us participating in this 
debate, some on the floor, some in the 
gallery. 
And I will tell you that the first 
thing I saw, Madam Speaker, because 
we did not know of the huge crowds 
down near the White House. We didn’t 
know that there were people dancing to 
music inside the White House, watch-
ing activities of attack here. But we 
did know about the major speech that 
was provoking a crowd of insurrection-
ists that had planned to come here and 
kill people. 
But the first thing I saw was good 
friends here rising up out of seats and 
moving out quickly. And only after 
they began to move did we hear the 
words, Hurry up. Get out. Flee. Not 
necessarily flee, but the first words I 
heard was our good leadership calling 
for the doors to be closed. Thank them 
for that, our Sergeant at Arms, who 
are here in this place. 
As we fled, we could hear the attack 
coming from the Senate side, and then 
we could hear the shooting that oc-
curred right outside in the cloakroom 
area. And we crouched there, and some 
of my good colleagues and I began to 
pray. 
I started out by saying this is not 
about us, but it is about truth. And as 
I 
mourned 
and 
honored 
Officer 
Sicknick, as he was honored by being 
in a state of honor in this House, I was 
reminded of the many officers, Capitol 
Hill and Metro Police, that are in hos-
pitals; that are still hurting; and that 
are still suffering. And I said earlier 
this evening that I offered to them my 
deepest concern and sympathy and re-
spect, and I will be introducing a reso-
lution to honor them. 
But I think the importance of this re-
living what we went through is, as I 
have heard from my colleagues, we 
must get to the bottom of this. We can-
not let white supremacy, which is now 
the number one terrorist activity or 
terrorist group in America, more so 
than foreign terrorists, dominate the 
goodness of what this democracy and 
this Constitution stands for. 
We can’t let the idea of free speech be 
the source of the fueling of hatred and 
anger that turns to violence. We can’t 
let individuals storm this building and 
call for the killing of the Vice Presi-
dent, or the killing of the Speaker of 
the House, or the putting on of plastic 
cuffs on Members of Congress. 
We can’t frighten Members of Con-
gress in their offices. We cannot allow 
this kind of attack on voices like the 
gentlewoman from New York who sim-
ply wants to tell truth. She has free-
dom. 
So I am here on the floor to say that 
we shall not be denied. We are never 
going to give up our love for democracy 
nor its vitality; nor are we going to let 
this country be dominated by the in-
surrectionists who came to this place 
to do nothing but act in a bloodthirsty 
manner. We are not afraid of you. 
And yes, on behalf of all of those offi-
cers that the video showed us that were 
beaten by American flags, beaten with 
signs of Nazism, we are going to get to 
the bottom of this for you. We are 
going to find out what happened. 
We are going to find out why the in-
formation came from the FBI to the 
City of Washington, D.C., and their po-
lice, and it was evident that it was 
given to the brass here, but that there 
was no response in terms of the kind of 
equipment or the numbers of officers 
that were there, or why wasn’t permis-
sion given to the mayor of the City of 
Washington to call up the National 
Guard. 
b 1930 
Why did this President deny access 
to the National Guard to protect, not 
us, but this place of democracy?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H362 
February 4, 2021 
I am grateful for this opportunity. 
We have work to do. But I think the 
greatest statement that we can make 
tonight, that we are in the light of day 
on this floor, as I said before, not for 
us, but to be able to stand in the shoes 
of all those heroes who fought in dif-
ferent ways, whether it was in the 
peace movement, whether it was in the 
civil rights movement, Black power 
movement, whether it was Cesar Cha-
vez fighting for farmworkers—people 
who fought to make a difference for 
goodness. 
For all of those patriots, all of those 
fallen leaders, some assassinated like 
Dr. Martin Luther King, we cannot 
stand and allow the voices of those who 
provided horror to this place to suggest 
to the world that they have overcome 
us. 
I close by simply saying to the world 
that we had a day, January 6, an at-
tack on this place, insurrectionists and 
domestic 
terrorists 
penetrated 
the 
United States Capitol, but they never 
penetrated the strength of the Con-
stitution and our values and our com-
mitment to protect democracy, but 
also to give respect and comfort to 
those who lost their lives on that day 
or thereafter, in terms of our law en-
forcement officers, and sadness for 
those unfortunately who lost their life 
by being misguided, but also to be able 
to say that this is a place that we will 
hold sacred. 
We will be victorious. White suprem-
acy, insurrectionists, and also domes-
tic terrorism will not prevail over us. 
We will win, and we will win for the 
many Americans who believe in the 
goodness of this country. 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
to me, and I thank her so very much 
for her courage. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the gentlewoman 
from New York, for organizing tonight 
and for inspiring rising generations of 
Americans, including my own daugh-
ters, to dream bigger and to do better. 
I want to start my remarks by ad-
dressing those who have belittled, dis-
missed, minimized, or criticized any-
one who has experienced trauma of any 
type, at any time, in any form. To you, 
I say I take pity on you, and I say 
shame on you. 
I was in this very room on January 6 
when the insurrection began. I was 1 of 
20 colleagues up in the gallery, just 
over my shoulder, who had to take 
cover behind our seats, on the floor, 
and struggle to activate our gas masks, 
the whizzing sounds, the collective 
whizzing sounds in this room, which 
none of us will ever forget. 
We know the sound of the breaking 
glass, of the screams, and of the fur-
niture being moved in front of the 
doors. We know the feeling of being 
trapped in this room and believing that 
being taken hostage may be the best- 
case scenario. 
We know what it feels like, searching 
for something, anything, with which to 
defend ourselves, and realizing a pencil 
is about all we had. We know what it 
feels like thinking that it is a real pos-
sibility that we would not see our fami-
lies and loved ones again. 
We won’t forget. We won’t forget. 
But I am not here this evening to 
seek sympathy or just to tell my 
story—rather, to make a public apol-
ogy. 
Recognizing that we were sitting 
ducks in this room, as the Chamber 
was about to be breached, I screamed 
to my colleagues to follow me across 
the aisle to the Republican side of the 
Chamber so that we could blend in—so 
that we could blend in—for I felt that 
the insurrectionists who were trying to 
break down the doors right here would 
spare us if they simply mistook us for 
Republicans. But within moments, I 
recognized that blending in was not an 
option available to my colleagues of 
color. 
So, I am here tonight to say to my 
brothers and sisters in Congress, and 
all around our country: I am sorry. I 
am sorry, for I had never understood, 
really understood, what privilege real-
ly means. 
It took a violent mob of insurrection-
ists and a lightning bolt moment in 
this very room, but now I know. Be-
lieve me, I really know. 
I want to close with an invitation, a 
hopeful invitation at that, to every-
body watching or listening. Whether 
you experienced January 6 right here 
in this room; whether you were barri-
caded in an office across the street; or 
whether, like most Americans, you ex-
perienced 
it 
through 
a 
television 
screen, please do not allow that day to 
change you for the worse. Rather, 
please find something in it to improve 
yourself, to improve our country, and 
to improve our world. 
I surely did, and I hope you will join 
me. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON). 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from New 
York for arranging this really impor-
tant Special Order hour. 
Every day, we are so grateful for the 
hard work and support of our congres-
sional staff. Many of them are young 
enough to be my children, but they 
serve Congress and our country with 
brilliance and honor every single day. 
This evening, I want to read a letter 
signed by nearly 400 congressional 
staffers to their Senators because they 
don’t often have a voice on this floor, 
but their words are so raw and so 
heart-wrenching. 
Here is their letter, titled ‘‘An Open 
Letter to Members of the U.S. Senate.’’ 
‘‘We are staff who work for Members 
of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House 
of Representatives, where it is our 
honor and privilege to serve our coun-
try and our fellow Americans. We write 
this letter to share our own views and 
experiences, not the views of our em-
ployers. But on January 6, 2021, our 
workplace was attacked by a violent 
mob trying to stop the electoral col-
lege vote count. That mob was incited 
by former President Donald J. Trump 
and his political allies, some of whom 
we pass every day in the hallways at 
work. 
‘‘Many of us attended school in the 
post-Columbine era and were trained to 
respond to active shooter situations in 
our classrooms. As the mob smashed 
through 
Capitol 
Police 
barricades, 
broke doors and windows, and charged 
into the Capitol with body armor and 
weapons, many of us hid behind chairs 
and under desks or barricaded our-
selves in offices. Others watched on TV 
and frantically tried to reach our 
bosses and colleagues as they fled for 
their lives. 
‘‘On January 6, the former President 
broke America’s 230-year legacy of the 
peaceful transition of power when he 
incited a mob to disrupt the counting 
of electoral college votes. Six people 
died. A Capitol Police officer—one of 
our coworkers who guards and greets 
us every day—was beaten to death. The 
attack on our workplace was inspired 
by lies told by the former President 
and others about the results of the 
election in a baseless, monthslong ef-
fort to reject votes lawfully cast by the 
American people. 
‘‘Our Constitution only works when 
we believe in it and defend it. It is a 
shared commitment to equal justice, 
the rule of law, and the peaceful resolu-
tion of our differences. Any person who 
doesn’t share these beliefs has no place 
representing the American people, now 
or in the future. The use of violence 
and lies to overturn an election is not 
worthy of debate. Either you stand 
with the Republic or against it. 
‘‘As 
congressional 
employees, 
we 
don’t have a vote on whether to con-
vict Donald J. Trump for his role in in-
citing the violent attack at the Cap-
itol, but our Senators do. And for our 
sake, and the sake of the country, we 
ask that they vote to convict the 
former President and bar him from 
ever holding office again.’’ 
It is signed by nearly 400 congres-
sional staff. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD their letter and 
their signatures. 
AN OPEN LETTER TO MEMBERS OF THE U.S. 
SENATE: We are staff who work for members 
of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, where it is our honor and privi-
lege to serve our country and our fellow 
Americans. We write this letter to share our 
own views and experiences, not the views of 
our employers. But on January 6, 2021, our 
workplace was attacked by a violent mob

less, months-long effort to reject votes law-

Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman OCASIO-CORTEZ 
for leading this Special Order hour, and 
I thank her for the bravery she exhib-
ited by sharing her story. 
January 6 was unlike any other day I 
lived through during my time in Con-
gress. I awoke with Georgia on my 
mind, with hope in my heart, after the 
runoff victories delivered us a Senate 
Democratic majority. That morning, it 
felt like we were turning the page on a 
dark chapter and entering a chapter of 
reckoning, progress, and, ultimately, 
unity. 
To fully turn that page, Congress 
needed to count the electoral college 
votes and certify the historic election 
of President Biden and Vice President 
Harris. That was supposed to be a per-
functory, procedural action. But it be-
came, instead, the target of an angry 
mob incited by the President, who en-
couraged that very mob to interfere 
and stop the counting of the ballots. 
Too many Republican colleagues em-
powered the lies that Trump told in-
stead of standing up for the truth and 
for our democracy. 
Earlier that day, I had followed press 
reports about a rally being organized 
by Trump supporters in Washington, 
and my staff warned me to be careful 
as I carried out business in and around 
the Capitol. I got to the Capitol early 
because I did not want to run into too 
many crowds, but I never imagined 
what was coming after Trump encour-
aged his supporters at a rally to storm 
the Capitol and disrupt the electoral 
college count. 
About 
midday, 
shortly 
before 
1 
o’clock, I was returning back to my 
Cannon House Office Building when the 
Capitol Police told me: Sir, we are 
closing down Cannon. We are evacu-
ating Cannon. You need to go to either 
the Longworth House Office Building 
or Rayburn and take cover. 
So, I followed the instructions. I 
made my way back to Longworth, 
where I took refuge in a colleague’s of-
fice. Eventually, I made it to a secure 
location in the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee offices in the Longworth base-
ment. 
It was there my phone started to 
blow up with anxious constituents who 
asked me if I was okay, and they made 
me aware of what was going on outside. 
I turned on the television, and I could 
not believe what I was seeing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H364 
February 4, 2021 
What I saw were Capitol Police being 
overwhelmed and the violent mob of 
Trump supporters breaking into the 
Capitol and bringing the electoral col-
lege vote count to a halt. 
As the violence unfolded, I have to 
say I was in a secure location, as safe 
as I could be for that moment. I was 
fine but shaken, concerned about what 
this meant for our democracy. 
I worried about the safety of my col-
leagues. I worried about the safety of 
the staff. I wondered when the National 
Guard would arrive, when reinforce-
ments would arrive, because it was ex-
traordinarily distressing to see our 
Capitol Police so greatly outnumbered 
by the crowd. 
I was safe. I turned out to be fine. I 
still am fine. But that is not the case 
for everyone. Unlike my colleagues and 
me who are here, most of the people 
who lived through the horrors of that 
day can’t share their experiences on 
the floor of the House today. 
I am here to give voice to and ac-
knowledge the experience of hundreds 
of congressional staffers, Capitol sup-
port staff, maintenance workers, and 
Capitol Police officers who also lived 
through that deadly insurrection. They 
experienced and lived the trauma, and 
it is just as valid and real as the stories 
that are being shared here today. 
b 1945 
Staff barricaded themselves in of-
fices. They heard banging on the doors 
from insurrectionists who could harm 
them. Staff also evacuated the House 
Chamber in gas masks. They were 
alone, gathering any items they could 
use as weapons in case the insurrec-
tionists broke into the very room they 
were sheltering in. They were in danger 
as well. This is their workplace, hun-
dreds of people who answer the phones 
and keep our buildings running and 
keep us safe every day. 
When you run for office, you are con-
fronted with the reality that you may 
be putting yourself in harm’s way. 
Staff didn’t ask for this, they didn’t 
sign up for this, to be put in harm’s 
way. They shouldn’t have had to have 
dealt with an attack like this. They 
were just doing their jobs. 
Those who lived through that dan-
gerous day or watched as the Capitol 
was attacked from home are also expe-
riencing pain and trauma. To them, I 
say: What you are feeling is valid, and 
we are here to support you, and don’t 
let anybody gaslight or diminish or be-
little what happened on January 6th. It 
was a serious event. 
Over the past few weeks, I learned 
that following the insurrection, the Of-
fice of Employee Assistance has been 
overwhelmed with requests for coun-
seling and support from our staff. After 
my staff on the House Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs and I were made 
aware of this overwhelming of requests 
at the Office of Employee Assistance, 
we worked with the VA to bring Mobile 
Vet Centers to the Capitol complex to 
provide mental health services and re-
sources to Capitol Police, the National 
Guard deployed at the Capitol, congres-
sional staff, journalists, and anyone 
who needs it. 
I visited one of the vet centers this 
morning, and they told me, vaguely, 
‘‘Congressman, the numbers are there. 
The numbers, out of confidentiality, we 
won’t tell you how many, but people 
are using these centers, and they are 
asking for help.’’ 
The Mobile Vet Centers can accept 
walk-in appointments every day, in-
cluding weekends, from 7 a.m. to 11 
p.m. If someone would like to schedule 
a next-day appointment, they may call 
the Washington, D.C. Vet Center at 
202–726–5212. 
I just want to emphasize, if you work 
at the Capitol, as part of the Capitol 
workforce, whether you work as a 
maintenance 
worker, 
whether 
you 
work as a staffer, this is available to 
you. 
I thank my colleagues and the staff 
who keep our democracy running. The 
only way to make this right and to 
help heal our Nation is for the Senate 
to do the right thing and hold Donald 
Trump accountable for the insurrec-
tion he incited. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for her incredible cour-
age. I asked her to go last because this 
is so personal. This is so hard because, 
as many of my colleagues and my clos-
est colleagues know, on my very first 
day of orientation, I got my first death 
threat. 
It was a serious one. They took me 
aside. The FBI had to go to the gentle-
man’s home. I didn’t even get sworn in 
yet and someone wanted me dead for 
just existing. 
More came later; uglier, more vio-
lent. One celebrating in writing the 
New Zealand massacre and hoping that 
more would come. Another mentioned 
my dear son, Adam, mentioning him by 
name. Each one paralyzed me each 
time. 
So what happened on January 6, all I 
can do is thank Allah that I wasn’t 
here. I felt overwhelming relief. I feel 
bad for ALEXANDRIA and so many of my 
colleagues who were here; but as I saw 
it, I thought to myself, Thank God I 
am not there. I saw the images that 
they didn’t get to see until later. 
My team and I decided at that point 
we would keep the death threats away. 
We tried to report them, document 
them, to keep them away from me be-
cause it just paralyzed me. All I want-
ed to do was come here and serve the 
people who raised me; the people who 
told my mother, who only had an 8th 
grade education, that she deserves 
human dignity; people who believed in 
me. 
So it is hard. It is hard when my 
seven brothers and six sisters beg me 
to get protection, many urging me to 
get a gun for the first time. And I have 
to tell you, the trauma from just being 
here, existing as a Muslim woman is so 
hard. But imagine my team, which I 
love and just adore. They are diverse. I 
have LGBTQ staff. I have a beautiful 
Muslim who wears her hijab proudly in 
the halls. I have Black women who are 
so proud to be here, to serve their 
country. I worry every day for their 
lives because of this rhetoric. I never 
thought that they would feel unsafe 
here. 
So I ask my colleagues to please try 
not to dehumanize what is happening. 
This is real. And you know many of our 
residents, from the shootings in Char-
lottesville to the massacre at the syna-
gogue, all of it—all of it is led by hate 
rhetoric like this. So I urge my col-
leagues to please, please take what 
happened on January 6 seriously. It 
will lead to more deaths. We can do 
better. We must do better. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I think that what Representa-
tive TLAIB speaks to is so powerful and 
so important because when we attack 
not just Members of Congress and focus 
on them because of their gender, their 
faith, their race, their creed, we make 
everyone on this complex feel unsafe 
and feel less than safe. Our seats do not 
belong to us. They belong to the people 
of the United States. We, as Members 
who come in and leave this Chamber, 
are not permanent fixtures. There are 
so many others in this country who see 
themselves in the 435 Members of this 
body. And to see individual Members 
targeted, demeaned, singled out by vir-
tue of how they were born is to single 
out and demean so many people in this 
country who see themselves on this 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Ms. BUSH), a 
powerful woman and leader that so 
many in our country see themselves in. 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from New York for 
being such a leader at this time. 
Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise 
to reflect on how our office experienced 
the white supremacist attack on our 
Nation’s Capitol on January 6. 
Everybody’s 
experiences 
are 
dif-
ferent, and everybody’s experiences 
must be validated. Everybody’s experi-
ences. 
I remember sitting up in the gallery 
listening to floor speeches, knowing 
that there was supposed to be a protest 
happening outside, seeing people out-
side and thinking that this was just 
part of the day. Until something hap-
pened, and I just felt the need to stand 
up and walk out. 
I walked out and walked over to the 
steps, and I went down a flight. I went 
to the steps and I went to look to see 
what was happening outside. I saw the 
tip-top of flags, and then I saw more of 
the flags, and I could read words. 
And then after I could read words, I 
could see people. Then I realized that 
people were approaching. So I hopped 
on the nearest elevator and left and 
made it back to my office safely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H365 
February 4, 2021 
When we came back into our office, 
we walked in, and we started to see on 
our televisions people breaching doors. 
I remember thinking, Is this actually 
what is happening? 
The more I watched, people were call-
ing this a protest. Let me say this: 
That was not a protest. I have been to 
hundreds of protests in my life. I have 
co-organized, co-led, led and organized 
protests not only in Ferguson, Mis-
souri, alongside the amazing Ferguson 
front line that most people don’t even 
acknowledge—they don’t even know 
their names. They don’t even know 
who died. They don’t even acknowledge 
the amazing people who put their lives 
and livelihoods on the line for our safe-
ty, believing that Black Lives Matter. 
Because they actually do. And we 
shouldn’t have to say it. It should just 
be true. But it is not evident in our so-
ciety when we have to continue to say, 
‘‘My life matters.’’ 
And then they hit us with things like 
this. So I remember sitting in the of-
fice with my team and just thinking to 
myself, I feel like I am back. At this 
very minute, I feel like I am back. I 
feel like this was one of the days out 
there on the streets when the white su-
premacists would show up and start 
shooting at us. This is one of the days 
when the police would ambush us from 
behind, from behind trees and from be-
hind buildings, and all of a sudden now 
we are on the ground being brutalized. 
It felt like one of those days. 
And I just remember taking a second 
thinking, if they touch these doors, if 
they hit these doors the way they hit 
that door, if they hit these doors and 
come anywhere near my staff—and I 
am just going to be real honest about 
it—my thought process was, we bang-
ing to the end. I am not letting them 
take out my people, and you are not 
taking me out. We have come too far. 
So, Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I 
rise with a message for our Republican 
colleagues. On January 6, I thought 
about January 3, and I thought about 
how we all raised our right hands up 
and took an oath, each and every one 
of us, on this very floor. We swore that 
we would support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
Even 
though 
that 
Constitution 
wasn’t written for people who look like 
me, even though that Constitution 
wasn’t written by people who look like 
me, and even though that Constitution 
cemented an unjust nation for people 
like me, my team and I got to working. 
We unveiled legislation to investigate 
and expel those who were responsible 
for inciting this attack so that we 
could defend it because we have a duty 
to fight for a more perfect Union. 
Because if you cannot stand up to 
white supremacy in this moment as 
Representatives, then why did you run 
for office in the first place? 
No matter what district you rep-
resent, no matter where you live, no 
matter Democrat or Republican, you 
represent a district that is, on average, 
about 700,000 people. Meaning, you have 
to represent those who love you, those 
who despise you, those who voted for 
you, those who swear they will never 
cast a vote for you, people who talk 
like you or people who don’t look like 
you. 
Building better communities, build-
ing better lives, building a better soci-
ety is not a Democratic or Republican 
issue. We can’t build a better society if 
Members are too scared to stand up 
and act to reject the white supremacist 
attack that happened right before our 
eyes. 
How can we trust that you will ad-
dress the suffering that white suprem-
acy causes on a day-to-day basis in the 
shadows if you can’t even address the 
white supremacy that happens right in 
front of you in your House? 
Does your silence speak to your 
agreement, is the question. 
In St. Louis, the COVID–19 pandemic 
is disproportionately hospitalizing and 
killing Black and Brown people. I have 
lived that. We have people dying from 
gun violence, a crisis that stems from 
decades of economic disinvestment and 
disruption from an overreliance on po-
licing that this very Chamber has con-
tinually voted to endorse. 
b 2000 
I have cried those tears. You don’t 
know what that is like. So I ask you 
today, take a moment to think about 
what it is like to live what we live 
through. If you cannot do what is right 
in the face of a blatant, heinous, foul, 
white supremacist attack like the one 
we just saw, how will you do right by 
the Black and Brown people you rep-
resent who just want to know that our 
children will have safety, that our chil-
dren will have life, and that they will 
have shelter, because you represent us, 
too. 
So on January 3, we stood together 
to swear our oath of office to the Con-
stitution. We swore to defend it against 
all enemies foreign and domestic. Well, 
it was attacked by a domestic enemy 
called white supremacy and we must 
stand together now, today, to uphold 
that oath and hold every single person 
who helped incite it accountable. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative BUSH 
for her comments today and for how 
she carries herself in this Chamber 
every day, which is just a powerful 
demonstration of why so many people 
are inspired by her example. 
Madam Speaker, how much time is 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York has 41⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, lastly, I would like to close, 
speaking to some of the individuals 
who have already been mentioned, and 
some of the folks who have already 
been mentioned in prior remarks: our 
staff, our Capitol Police, our House 
clerks, we thank you. 
We know how many of you were put 
in the line of danger because of the job 
that you have. We know and felt how 
many staffers were willing to put 
themselves on the line in order to pro-
tect the Members that they serve 
alongside, and that is a weight that no 
one should have to carry. 
And so we say thank you to our 
House clerks. We say thank you to 
every single staff member of the United 
States Congress. We say thank you to 
our food service workers. We say thank 
you to our custodial workers, sweeping 
up the glass on the floor shattered by 
white supremacists, cleaning up after 
their mess. 
There are not enough ways to say 
thank you. We say thank you to our 
Capitol Police who were willing to de-
fend us. And, again, to our staffers we 
say thank you. 
I would be remiss if I did not specifi-
cally thank my staffer right here to 
my left, Gerardo Bonilla Chavez, who 
was with me on the day of the attack, 
and who did everything he could to 
protect me. 
I want his community to know that 
he is a hero. I want his parents and his 
family to know that he is a hero. Our 
staff already know that he is a hero, 
and I believe he is a hero, too. 
And I know it is not just him. He will 
be the first one to say that. But to 
every one of our House clerks, we say 
thank you; to our Capitol Police we 
say thank you; to our food service 
workers, our custodial workers, every 
person here that was standing to fight 
for our democracy, we thank you. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

BIDEN’S UNILATERAL EXECUTIVE 
ORDERS ARE HARMFUL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on the 
topic of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, in 
the first days of his administration, 
President Biden has taken a record- 
breaking number of executive actions 
and he has signed more executive or-
ders than any President in recent his-
tory. 
I am very proud this evening to be 
joined by some of my colleagues from 
the Congressional Western Caucus. As 
a group, we represent constituents 
across the country who have been neg-
atively impacted by these actions of 
President Biden. 
On his very first day in office, the 
President signed an executive order to

February 4, 2021 
revoke the Presidential permit for the 
Keystone XL pipeline. This innovative, 
first-of-its-kind 
energy 
project 
has 
been in the works for years with local 
communities, numerous States, and 
even our neighbor to the north, Can-
ada, investing heavily in its creation. 
Also, on day one, President Biden di-
rected his Acting Secretary of the Inte-
rior to issue a 60-day moratorium on 
new oil and gas leases on Federal lands. 
And then if that weren’t enough, to 
complete the one-two punch, a week 
later, he extended that moratorium in-
definitely. 
Madam Speaker, I am confident my 
colleagues will echo this sentiment: It 
is unconscionable that President Biden 
would, during a global pandemic, elimi-
nate thousands of jobs and prevent the 
creation of thousands more with one 
flick of his pen. 
As you will hear from my colleagues, 
this action was thoughtless and dev-
astating to the hundreds of commu-
nities and the millions of Americans 
who rely on the oil and gas industry, 
from labor unions, local small busi-
nesses, to rural school districts, con-
servationists, people all over the coun-
try. 
His long-term goals may very well be 
well-intentioned, but, Madam Speaker, 
right now, in communities across the 
country, jobs, revenue, and investment 
are lost. They have just disappeared. 
Madam Speaker, what does President 
Biden propose to do in the meantime? 
This truly can be described as an at-
tack on American energy and Amer-
ican workers. 
Over the last 4 years during the 
Trump 
administration, 
the 
United 
States has made huge strides toward 
energy independence, becoming the 
largest net exporter of energy in the 
world. 
President Biden’s actions will unilat-
erally undo this progress. It will 
threaten our energy security and leave 
thousands of hardworking American 
men and women without a job. Presi-
dent Biden has acted without any input 
or meaningful debate from the Mem-
bers of this Congress who represent the 
people who are most affected by his or-
ders. 
Madam Speaker, tonight, we are here 
to make our voices and their voices 
heard. I am proud to be joined, as I 
said, with many of the outstanding 
members of the Congressional Western 
Caucus, and we have a lot of them who 
have a lot of great things to say. 
My first guest is a new member of 
our executive committee. He comes 
from the State of Minnesota, where at 
least 50,000 jobs are supported by min-
ing in his home State, a tremendous 
amount of economic activity. 
So I am very pleased to yield to the 
gentleman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mr. 
STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for this oppor-
tunity. 
I rise with my colleagues today out 
of serious concern for the well-being of 
America’s workers and American en-
ergy independence. 
Under the Trump administration, 
America came first. The priority was 
lowering energy costs for Americans 
and ending our supply chain depend-
ency, along with supporting high-wage 
jobs in the energy industry. 
Sadly, within just 2 weeks, Joe Biden 
has started destroying much of that 
progress and setting our Nation back. 
President 
Biden’s 
executive 
orders 
have ended high-wage pipeline jobs on 
Keystone XL. He has banned oil and 
gas development on Federal lands and 
forced America to rejoin the unfair 
Paris climate agreement which gives a 
free pass to polluters like India and 
Communist China. 
His 
actions 
have 
serious 
con-
sequences for my rural district and dis-
tricts like mine. 
In my district, gas prices have start-
ed to dramatically increase as Joe 
Biden keeps punishing American fami-
lies with executive order after execu-
tive order. 
In fact, since November 30, the gas 
prices have already risen $0.32 and 
counting. A 60-mile round trip for work 
is not uncommon in northern Min-
nesota. Already, that is a $244 a year 
increase per driver. Imagine what it 
will be like for middle class families if 
these increases continue. 
Furthermore, Joe Biden’s executive 
order canceling critical projects like 
the Keystone XL pipeline sends a 
chilling message to union members na-
tionwide, including in my district 
where many are currently working to 
replace the Line 3 pipeline. 
Many workers are asking themselves: 
Will Joe Biden cancel their job next? 
And what about those individuals who 
were employed with a good-paying, 
high-quality job working on pipelines 
or in oil fields on our Federal lands? 
Because of Joe Biden’s anti-jobs 
agenda, these individuals are not only 
being denied a living wage, but the dig-
nity of work. Meanwhile, they will still 
need to put gas in their vehicles. 
Prices will keep rising and the gas 
they use won’t be produced by hard-
working Americans any longer. In-
stead, they will be purchasing gas for 
their trucks from hostile countries like 
Russia, Venezuela, and China, all of 
which signed the Paris climate agree-
ment, but not one of these countries 
has met their obligation. 
Madam Speaker, Joe Biden’s unilat-
eral executive orders are harmful. It 
may not be understood here in the 
Beltway, but my constituents know 
that these executive orders mean job 
loss and higher energy costs for the 
American family. 
It has been less than a month and Joe 
Biden has already made his agenda 
very, very clear. American jobs, Amer-
ican families, and American energy 
independence are no longer first. 
At this time of economic uncer-
tainty, I urge the Biden administration 
to change their reckless course. I urge 
the Biden administration to abandon 
the failed Obama-era policies and sup-
port an all-of-the-above energy strat-
egy that will create jobs, keep energy 
costs low, and maintain our energy 
independence which will enhance our 
national security. 
And by working together to support 
energy jobs and reduced dependence on 
foreign nations, we have the chance to 
create a tomorrow with unimaginable 
potential. 
b 2015 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Thank you, Con-
gressman STAUBER, in helping to put a 
human face onto the issue that we are 
speaking about. The real cost to Amer-
ican citizens, the loss of jobs cannot be 
understated and the impact to our 
communities and to families across 
this country. So thank you very much. 
Madam Speaker, a lot of States will 
be impacted. The whole country will 
be. I am going to turn to someone from 
the great State of Texas, but you prob-
ably know this already: This ban from 
President Biden will eliminate 2 mil-
lion jobs in the oil and gas industry in 
Texas alone—in one State. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), from 
the 
Houston 
area, 
representing, 
I 
think, probably the epicenter of petro-
leum refining in this country, another 
fine Member of our Western Caucus. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my 
good 
friend 
from 
Washington 
State—and a classmate—for having 
this. It is good to be here. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today 
as a proud representative of Houston, 
Texas, the epicenter of American en-
ergy and the catalyst for this country’s 
pursuit of energy independence. But, 
unfortunately, our economic bedrock 
of oil and gas is under attack, severe 
attack, by an administration that is 
eliminating millions of jobs and leav-
ing our national security wide open to 
threats from adversaries. 
An oil and gas moratorium on Fed-
eral lands is projected to cost America 
1 million jobs. Revoking the Keystone 
XL pipeline permit will cost us 11,000 
jobs in 2021 alone and account for the 
loss of $1.6 billion in gross wages. 
Rejoining the Paris climate accord, 
which was originally poorly negotiated 
by President Obama, is projected to 
cost us 400,000 jobs and is simply a bad 
deal for the American people and very 
good deal for the world’s biggest pol-
luter, Communist China. What hap-
pened to this new administration’s 
promise to stand up for all Americans? 
From gas and electric bills, to new 
highways and bridges, to taxes, to put-
ting food on the table, what happens to 
the oil and gas industry affects all 
Americans, and killing these jobs will 
have a ripple effect that will be felt in 
every home in the Nation. 
Additionally, if we destroy oil and 
natural gas production here by can-
celing these pipelines and forcing ad-
herence to widely burdensome red tape, 
we will then have to import oil and 
natural gas from overseas and burn

much fuel to get it here. And that 
means that we will be paying more for 
energy that was processed not using 
the same, stringent clean environ-
mental regulations that we have here 
in America. 
No, if we want to stand here and talk 
about cleaner energy solutions, we 
have to acknowledge the fact that pipe-
lines are by far the safest and most en-
vironmentally friendly way to trans-
port energy. In fact, pipelines have a 
99.9 percent safety record. When we kill 
energy jobs here in the United States, 
we are in turn killing clean energy jobs 
globally. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BABIN. I thank him 
for explaining to us and helping us un-
derstand the pipeline industry and 
what that does for our country, how it 
improves safety, and, certainly, our 
care for the environment as well. 
Madam Speaker, I next turn to one 
to our newest Members—new to our 
caucus, but also to the House of Rep-
resentatives—a young lady from the 
State of New Mexico. YVETTE HERRELL 
is doing just a great job in the short 
time that she has been here with us. 
And let me just tell you a little bit 
about New Mexico. If you want an ex-
ample of a State that is reliant on this 
industry, oil and gas, you have to look 
no farther than New Mexico. 
You can correct me if I am wrong, 
but at least 134,000 jobs are supported 
by that industry. And I know it is a 
huge part of your State’s economy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL). 
Congresswoman HERRELL, thank you 
very much for being with us. 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman NEWHOUSE for yielding 
and for his leadership in holding this 
Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, with the stroke of a 
pen, President Biden threatened the 
economy and public education systems 
of New Mexico, seven other Western 
States, four Gulf States, and Alaska. 
To put it simply, the executive ac-
tions he took on behalf of radical envi-
ronmentalists to stop new oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands is nothing 
short of disastrous. 
In New Mexico, over half the oil pro-
duction and two-thirds of the natural 
gas production occurs on Federal lands. 
That production employs nearly 120,000 
people Statewide, and estimates show a 
ban on new oil and gas leases could 
cost the State over 60,000 jobs by the 
end of 2022. 
Royalty payments and taxes from 
the oil and gas industry contribute 
more than over one-third of our State’s 
general fund. The loss in revenue from 
this leasing ban will have the greatest 
impact on the children of New Mexico, 
as over $1 billion from the oil and gas 
industry goes to New Mexico public 
schools every year. 
Madam Speaker, before the ban was 
announced, I sent a letter to New Mex-
ico Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, 
asking how she would make up the lost 
revenue. I have yet to receive a reply. 
After the announcement, I intro-
duced the POWER Act, along with 
nearly 40 of my Republican colleagues. 
This bill would prevent the President 
from halting new oil and gas leasing 
along with coal, hard-rock mineral, 
and critical mineral leasing on Federal 
lands without consent of Congress. 
For too long, Congress has ceded au-
thority over our public lands to the ex-
ecutive branch. This will enable Con-
gress to take back control and stand up 
for the people we represent. 
Just yesterday, I also introduced the 
Protecting New Mexico’s Jobs and Pub-
lic Education System Act, which would 
exempt New Mexico from the current 
ban on new oil and gas leasing. 
My State would be the most nega-
tively affected in the Nation by a leas-
ing ban. More than half of the onshore 
oil produced on Federal lands in the 
U.S. is produced in New Mexico. 
Madam Speaker, I must also point 
out that the oil and gas industry is not 
just about filling up our cars and heat-
ing our homes, petroleum-based prod-
ucts are an essential part of our every-
day lives. Petroleum-based products in-
clude mini medical devices, articles of 
clothing, and even sporting equipment. 
In response to concerns we raised re-
garding the loss in oil and gas jobs, the 
Biden administration said people can 
just find work in the renewable energy 
sector. 
Madam Speaker, well that just is not 
good enough. In fact, statistics show 
workers involved in oil and gas extrac-
tion make an average of $48 an hour. 
How do I tell my constituents to go 
earn much less than that in other in-
dustries? At a time when our economy 
has been weakened by the COVID–19 
pandemic and many of our constituents 
are out of work, we should be focused 
on protecting good-paying jobs, not 
eliminating them. I look forward to 
working with my Western Caucus col-
leagues over the coming weeks to pro-
mote this message and to give a voice 
to our constituents whose lives will be 
harmed by the executive actions of the 
Biden administration. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
NEWHOUSE again for hosting this Spe-
cial Order. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman HERRELL. I ap-
preciate her helping us understand the 
impact on the State of New Mexico, 
not just jobs but schools as well—$1 
billion cost to the school districts of 
your State. I just can’t imagine the 
long-term, detrimental impacts that 
that will bring. 
Speaking of that, I turn to another 
gentleman from the State of Texas, 
someone I got to know very well on the 
Committee on Rules. MICHAEL BURGESS 
represents his district in Texas, and 
similar to what we just heard from 
New Mexico, I believe Texas school dis-
tricts also, through property taxes on 
oil and gas production, on pipelines, on 
gas utilities receive at least $1 billion a 
year as well. 
Dr. BURGESS, thank you so much for 
being here this evening and helping us 
tell the American people the real im-
pact of these decisions. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman, and congratulate 
him for the chairmanship of the West-
ern Caucus, and I appreciate being in-
cluded in this discussion this evening. 
Madam Speaker, on the way over 
here, here is a bit of breaking news: 
POLITICO, in their online newsletter, 
6:30 tonight, the headline: ‘‘Biden’s 
plans for recovery imperiled by swell-
ing ranks of long-term jobless.’’ 
First sentence reads: 
Millions of Americans are staring at the 
reality of long-term unemployment, a pre-
carious and worsening situation that threat-
ens to drag on the economic recovery after 
the pandemic ends. 
You know what, I remember when 
Democrats used to be the champion of 
the working class, the champion of the 
working man and woman. 
Long-term unemployment is so dam-
aging to people’s families and people’s 
lives. Suspending the production on 
Federal lands—granted Texas doesn’t 
have the amount of Federal lands that 
some of the other Western States do, 
but still, it affects us. 
And Todd Staples, our former agri-
culture commissioner in the State of 
Texas—now the head of the Texas Oil 
and Gas Association—writes in Janu-
ary: ‘‘Banning energy development on 
Federal lands and in offshore waters 
not only threatens thousands of the 
best-paying jobs, but needlessly erases 
much-needed revenue that helps pay 
for schools and other essential serv-
ices,’’ so said Todd Staples, the presi-
dent of Texas Oil and Gas Association. 
Going on: ‘‘American oil and natural 
gas is safe, clean and abundant, and 
misguided policies will only stifle our 
Nation’s energy and environmental 
progress.’’ A million jobs across the 
country—120,000 of those in the State 
of Texas alone. 
And as we heard from our colleague, 
Ms. HERRELL, it does affect tax reve-
nues for local activities in our schools, 
building our highways. 
Todd Staples went on to say: 
The oil and natural gas industry is pro-
ducing energy in cleaner and more efficient 
ways than 10 to 15 years ago, all while pro-
ducing more affordable and reliable energy 
to power our daily lives. Increased use of 
natural gas is the number one reason the 
United States power sector cut carbon diox-
ide emissions 33 percent. 
Now, look, everybody talks about 
going to electric cars. Where is the 
electricity going to come from? Well, 
some of it is going to come from nat-
ural 
gas, 
natural 
gas-fired 
power 
plants. 
But, again, I do remember when the 
Democratic party used to be the party 
of the working man and woman. I ques-
tion why President Biden has strayed 
so far from that. A little over 2 weeks 
ago, he said, on the western steps of 
this Capitol building, that his number

one priority was going to be American 
jobs. And then he immediately causes 
immeasurable harm to millions of 
Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for leading this hour and for 
letting me participate. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
think you are starting to get the mes-
sage that it is clear: This is going to 
impact every citizen of this country. 
These wrongheaded decisions are im-
pacting our way of life, our cost of liv-
ing in so many different ways. 
I don’t know what the next speaker is 
going to talk about for sure, but I will 
make a guess that BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
who is our new ranking member of the 
Committee on Natural Resources, hail-
ing from the State of Arkansas, may 
talk about a tree. I am not sure about 
that, but certainly, the natural re-
source impacts here are going to be 
real, and I always say people may not 
understand that. But we passed a huge 
bill last Congress—I am sure you re-
member the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund—which was part of a bigger 
piece of legislation. Well, guess where a 
lot of that money comes from to make 
that happen? It is from oil and gas 
leases. And I think the great State of 
Arkansas is set to get a lot of money in 
2021 from that fund. And this is going 
to have an impact there. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN), and thank him not only 
for his partnership and his activity and 
work on the Western Caucus, but also 
on the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Wash-
ington and commend him for the great 
work that he has done with the West-
ern Caucus and also here in Congress to 
be a voice for rural America and for 
these areas, like my district, that de-
pend on Natural Resources. 
Madam Speaker, our country is at a 
crossroads on the environment. One 
road leads to a vibrant, all-of-the- 
above energy approach, where we com-
bine our state-of-the-art technology 
with hardworking American ingenuity 
and work ethic to incentivize smart en-
vironmental solutions. 
The other road leads to a top-down 
regulatory approach in which those in 
power ban, tax, and prohibit energy ac-
cess resulting in economic ruin and en-
vironmental degradation. It is clear 
which path President Biden has chosen. 
With a stroke of a pen, he eliminated 
thousands of American jobs, put many 
more into jeopardy, defunded bipar-
tisan 
conservation 
programs, 
and 
eliminated some of the safest, most re-
liable forms of energy production and 
transportation we have. 
Let’s 
not 
confuse 
action 
with 
progress. The data is very clear. Amer-
ica leads the world in environmental 
standards. If our goal is actually a 
cleaner, safer, and healthier environ-
ment—and I hope it is—then we should 
continue modeling these standards for 
the rest of the world to follow, while 
developing the technology of the fu-
ture. 
However, through his sweeping bans 
that killed the Keystone pipeline and 
shut down new energy leases on Fed-
eral lands and water, President Biden 
is merely shifting our current demand 
for energy overseas. 
Let me make that very clear: Much 
as my Democrat colleagues might pre-
tend otherwise, America’s demand for 
oil and natural gas will not go away 
overnight. It cannot. Our infrastruc-
ture depends on it. So by shutting 
down one of our main domestic sup-
plies, our supply will shift overseas, 
where we have no control over their en-
vironmental standards. 
Put simply, President Biden’s orders 
will hurt our environment in the long 
run and devastate our economy in the 
meantime. 
So what is our alternative? 
How about allowing the free market 
to work, like it always has. We have an 
innovative, pragmatic plan in place, 
unlike 
the 
Democrats’ 
haphazard, 
shooting-from-the-hip approach. It is 
why I have submitted pro-growth solu-
tions like the Trillion Trees Act. 
Madam Speaker, we don’t need to 
make hollow political points with no 
substance and no hope for success. We 
need an energy plan that looks to the 
future while taking care of the needs of 
today. 
b 2030 
Democrats want to make us choose 
between a healthy environment and a 
strong economy. I am here to tell you 
we can have both. Actually, if we want 
a cleaner, safer, healthier environment, 
then we must have a strong economy. 
They go hand-in-hand. 
I hope President Biden reverses this 
ban and puts our environment and 
America’s economy first. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman WESTERMAN. I ap-
preciate that very much, and I thank 
him for getting in that word ‘‘tree.’’ I 
appreciate that very much and for real-
ly helping us understand the true im-
pacts not only to our economy but to 
our environment of these kinds of deci-
sions. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY), 
another W State, which we have to 
stick together, a strong member of the 
Congressional 
Western 
Caucus. 
He 
comes from a State that also is set to 
receive a tremendous amount of fund-
ing through the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, which, again, is fi-
nanced through oil and gas leases. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man TIFFANY
for participating this 
evening, and I appreciate him being 
here. 
Mr. 
TIFFANY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
while America and Congress’ attention 
has been diverted from the real issues, 
we have seen something over the last 
couple of weeks that is going to com-
promise American security in three 
ways. 
One is national security; two, our 
economic security; and most important 
for millions of Americans, their job se-
curity. 
First came the White House decision 
to shred the Keystone pipeline permit, 
a slap in the face to our friends in Can-
ada and a pink slip for countless Amer-
icans who rely on the strategic energy 
security project for their livelihoods. 
But you know what may have hap-
pened, 
most 
importantly? 
With 
a 
stroke of a pen, a contract was elimi-
nated. Can other countries trust Amer-
ica anymore? Can Americans trust our 
President and our executive branch 
when, at a stroke of a pen, they unilat-
erally say that contract is null and 
void? 
Then came the moratorium on Fed-
eral oil and gas leases, the prospect of 
a long-term drilling ban on public 
lands, and even steps to halt energy 
projects on private land. 
The White House has also pushed the 
U.S. back into the U.N.’s Paris climate 
treaty, subjecting American interests 
to the whim of international bureau-
crats. By the way, the English were 
smart enough to get out of one of those 
agreements. They called it Brexit. 
These things will kill family-wage 
American 
jobs 
that 
can’t 
be 
outsourced, raising prices at the pump 
and draining trillions of dollars from 
the U.S. economy. All of this was done 
with a stroke of a pen, without ap-
proval from Congress, and the rami-
fications will be disastrous. 
Madam Speaker, when it comes to 
national security, it is no coincidence 
that we have seen peace break out in 
the Middle East over the last few 
years. The diplomatic achievements of 
the Trump administration in that trou-
bled region are a result, in part, of poli-
cies that have made American energy 
dominance a reality. We gained the 
upper hand when we began producing 
more petroleum and became energy 
independent in America. By turning 
back the clock on these historic gains, 
the new administration is putting more 
American lives and treasure at risk. 
Closer to home, the economic costs 
will also be dire. The cancellation of 
the Keystone pipeline and new energy 
restrictions have put Wisconsin jobs on 
the chopping block, including more 
than 2,000 jobs at Michels and Precision 
Pipeline, two fine American companies 
and Wisconsin companies. These com-
panies will not be the only victims of 
the Biden administration’s great leap 
backward. 
Thousands of downstream companies 
provide support services to pipeline 
firms, businesses like parts suppliers, 
steelworkers, fracking sand mine oper-
ators, and even restaurants, taverns, 
and other Main Street businesses that 
count energy industry workers among 
their customers. All of these businesses 
are in the crosshairs for another eco-
nomic hit, this one inflicted by their 
own government in Washington, not a 
pandemic in Wuhan.

Even more galling was the adminis-
tration’s glib response that these hard-
working Americans should simply suck 
it up and find better jobs. Is that what 
unity looks like, Madam Speaker? 
By taking aim at Americans who 
work in oil and gas, the Biden adminis-
tration will cripple a key stream of 
revenues for State and local govern-
ments, funding that they rely on to pay 
for schools, road repairs, first respond-
ers, and public health services. In Wis-
consin alone, the loss of revenue asso-
ciated with the cancellation of Key-
stone is estimated to hit $3 billion. 
I would like to emphasize, while we 
are here with the chair of the Western 
Caucus and hearing from Members 
from the west side of Mississippi—Wis-
consin is on the east side of the Mis-
sissippi—it is Eastern States that are 
going to be hit with this equally hard, 
including the States of Ohio and Penn-
sylvania. 
While people in our communities are 
struggling to pay their bills and find 
work, this administration is killing 
jobs and making their lives more ex-
pensive. 
While those on the other side are 
pushing a $350 billion State bailout, the 
White House is choking off their reve-
nues. 
While our Nation faces rising threats 
from foreign adversaries, the other side 
is taking active steps that will make 
America less safe, less secure, and less 
self-reliant. 
American workers are tired of being 
lectured about carbon emissions by 
people who fly around the world on pri-
vate jets, like President Biden’s cli-
mate czar, who admitted that even if 
U.S. emissions dropped to zero, it 
would make no difference because 90 
percent of CO2 comes from other coun-
tries. In fact, a third of the total global 
emissions come from China. 
The bottom line is that access to af-
fordable, abundant, and reliable energy 
is essential to a dynamic economy sup-
porting millions of good Made in the 
USA jobs in American manufacturing. 
Madam Speaker, when the White 
House attacks homegrown energy jobs 
for purely political gain, China wins 
and America loses. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman TIFFANY. Well-spo-
ken. The economy, jobs, the environ-
ment, schools, national security, the 
impacts of these decisions are far and 
wide across this country. 
One of the great things about a cit-
izen legislative body is that we are 
made up of individuals from all walks 
of life, and I am very proud that we 
have, on the Western Caucus, a new 
member to the caucus and also a new 
member of our executive committee, 
but also someone whose family is one 
of these people who we are talking 
about whose jobs will be impacted by 
these decisions. 
Madam Speaker, I am anxious to 
hear from our new Member from Colo-
rado, and I thank her very much for 
being a part of this discussion, coming 
from a State that has tens of thousands 
of jobs that rely on this industry. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Washington, 
and I thank my chairman of the West-
ern Caucus. It is an honor to serve with 
him, especially in a time like this 
where our energy needs are so dramati-
cally threatened. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as the 
proud 
Representative 
of 
Colorado’s 
Third Congressional District, one of 
the most beautiful districts in the en-
tire Nation, where waters like the Col-
orado, the Arkansas, and the Animas 
Rivers flow, and snow falling along the 
Rocky 
Mountains 
provides 
outdoor 
recreation in towns like Durango, Tel-
luride, Aspen, and Steamboat Springs. 
Colorado’s Third District is also 
home to some of the Nation’s most 
abundant energy resources. We all win 
when American energy workers develop 
our resources responsibly at home. Yet, 
this administration is laser-focused on 
eliminating fossil fuels and the major-
ity of jobs in the energy industry. 
It is not complicated. We are strong-
er and safer as a country when we re-
main energy independent and when dic-
tators across the world can no longer 
fund their deadly terrorist activities on 
the backs of our energy needs. 
Madam Speaker, there is no reason 
the U.S. should be dependent on vola-
tile foreign sources from countries like 
Russia, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia when we 
can safely produce these resources 
right here in America, creating Amer-
ican jobs. 
American ingenuity and innovation 
have resulted in the U.S. becoming a 
global leader in carbon emissions re-
ductions. Protecting our environment 
while safely producing American en-
ergy are not mutually exclusive goals. 
Advancements 
associated 
with 
fracking and horizontal drilling are the 
main reasons the U.S. has become a 
world leader in protecting the Earth. 
You heard me. Fracking, demonized by 
the left without any merit, has proven 
to be one of the best energy solutions 
for our environment. I think it is be-
coming very clear that my colleagues 
on the left have become fracking liars. 
But these facts don’t matter to the 
Biden administration. All they seem to 
care about is appeasing extremist envi-
ronmentalists in order to get more 
campaign donations. 
With the stroke of his pen, which 
sometimes takes him a while to find, 
President Joe Biden has unilaterally 
imposed job-killing executive orders 
and 
overreaching 
energy 
mandates 
that are going to crush my district and 
the people who live within it. 
From rejoining the Paris Agreement 
without asking the Senate to ratify 
this treaty, to unilaterally eliminating 
the Keystone XL pipeline, to banning 
all new Federal oil and gas leases, the 
Biden 
administration 
has 
already 
taken actions that will eliminate thou-
sands of Colorado’s jobs, just as the 
gentleman mentioned, and send my 
people, the people I was sent to rep-
resent in my district, to the unemploy-
ment line. 
Madam Speaker, I have met with my 
constituents. They don’t understand 
why this administration is targeting 
their livelihoods and telling them that 
they can simply find other jobs. 
The energy workers in Colorado’s 
Third District like their jobs. They are 
good at them. They are the best at ex-
tracting these resources responsibly. 
They don’t want to be unemployed dur-
ing a pandemic and worry about how 
they are going to put food on the table 
or make ends meet for their families. 
Just last week, President Biden un-
veiled a Green New Deal-like environ-
mental plan. While the price tag is as-
tronomical and its goals unrealistic, 
the real tragedy associated with this $2 
trillion charade will be the number of 
men and women in my district who 
have to come home and tell a spouse 
and their children that they were laid 
off and are unable to provide for their 
family. 
It is not Big Oil that is going to close 
their doors as a result of Biden’s execu-
tive orders. It is the little guys in 
small, rural communities that will be 
hit hardest by this administration’s ac-
tions that seek to eliminate all coal, 
oil, and natural gas as its electricity 
sources by 2035. 
Joe Biden’s team learned nothing 
from the American energy renaissance 
we saw under the Trump administra-
tion: low gas prices, the lowest average 
unemployment rate ever until COVID, 
and the greatest economy the world 
has ever seen. 
Madam Speaker, energy dominance 
and America first policies have been 
replaced by climate change overkill 
and people like John Kerry flying 
around the world in their private jets, 
telling 
hardworking 
Americans 
to 
make better choices. 
We are the land of the free and will 
always be. I will never allow my four 
boys to live in a socialist nation. For 
all the people in the Third District 
that I so proudly represent, I will 
proudly fight the Green New Deal poli-
cies and Joe Biden’s job-killing execu-
tive orders with everything that I 
have; I will support freedom and pros-
perity at every opportunity; and I will 
oppose any effort that seeks to take 
the God-given freedom and rights away 
from the American people. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman BOEBERT. I ap-
preciate her strong voice on behalf of 
not only the people she represents, but 
people all over the country. I thank her 
for those very valuable comments. 
Madam Speaker, as you can already 
tell, we have a very strong class of new 
Members this year. I would like to turn 
to another who comes from the State 
of Utah, a State that I don’t think is 
the highest with Federal land owner-
ship, but pretty darn close. Sixty-three 
percent, I understand, of the land in

February 4, 2021 
BLAKE MOORE’s State is under Federal 
ownership. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE). I know 
he has a great perspective on this 
issue, and I am very anxious to wel-
come him and give him the floor so 
that he can share with us his thoughts. 
b 2045 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, when the gentleman says perspec-
tive, the part I would like to highlight 
is that it is about balance. I am going 
to speak to that in a little bit, but be-
fore my comments get drowned out in 
some of the prepared statements, mak-
ing sure there is balance benefits all, 
and it is something that I am really 
passionate about and Utahns are pas-
sionate about. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to call 
on the Biden administration to reverse 
its unilateral orders, including Execu-
tive Order 14008 pausing new oil and 
gas leases on Federal land; Secretarial 
Order 3395 suspending mineral leasing 
and permits; and Executive Order 13990 
revoking the Keystone XL pipeline per-
mit. 
Utah, as the gentleman mentioned, 
has the second highest percentage of 
federally owned land at about 65 per-
cent. Approximately 10,000 Utahns rely 
on the oil and gas industry for their 
employment and livelihoods. These or-
ders will result in Utah families losing 
their jobs and will reduce crucial fund-
ing for conservation programs that 
protect the natural wonders of my 
home State and our great country. 
They will make our country more re-
liant on imported energy from other 
countries with lower environmental 
standards than our own and weaken 
our national security foothold. Re-
stricting extraction has real costs for 
our schools, our first responders, and 
public services. The Keystone pipe-
line’s 
MOU 
with 
North 
America’s 
Building Trades Unions will provide $10 
million in renewable energy job train-
ing for union workers and invests a 
total of $1.7 billion in renewable energy 
infrastructure, proving that a produc-
tive balance of development and con-
servation can be achieved. 
Rushed executive actions do not 
allow for collaboration with the people 
who are directly impacted by these de-
cisions. Utahns will feel the negative 
effects of these orders. 
I encourage the administration to re-
verse these actions and work with a bi-
partisan group of legislators on solu-
tions that both protect and develop our 
cherished lands. I ran on a sincere de-
sire to work with the administration to 
promote productivity over partisan-
ship, and I stand by that commitment 
today. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate that very much. 
Continuing a theme of our strong 
freshman class, I turn to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN). This 
is kind of news to me. I didn’t realize 
that Kansas is such a major producer 
of energy. I think of Kansas as wheat 
and corn, but energy is an important 
part of the economy. I don’t think a lot 
of Americans understand truly the im-
pact of these decisions in other States. 
I thank Congressman MANN for partici-
pating tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
My district in Kansas has a lot of oil 
and gas, and a lot of ethanol produc-
tion as well, which is very important 
for the energy, the backstop for the 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss President Biden’s recent executive 
actions and their impacts on American 
energy. 
Kansas-1, the Big First, is one of the 
most productive agricultural areas of 
the country, and is also home to a 
flourishing energy industry. In a rural 
district like the Big First, commu-
nities shrink and grow with oil and gas 
prices. My district is the 11th largest 
district in this country and has more 
than 83,000 miles of roads. We depend 
on energy every day to fuel agricul-
tural equipment and to transport our 
products across the country and around 
the world. 
Crude oil and natural gas are the 
foundation that fuels the Big First. 
Whether it be diesel for a tractor, keep-
ing our home and families warm, or 
filling up a gas tank to drive our kids 
30 miles each way to school, my dis-
trict needs energy. In addition, the Big 
First also produced nearly 500 million 
gallons of ethanol last year. 
I am gravely concerned with Presi-
dent Biden’s mandates on oil and gas. 
In my first few weeks in Congress, 
President Biden issued 25 executive or-
ders in his first 10 days as President. 
That is more than the last 7 Presidents 
combined during their first 10 days. 
For example, President Biden delivered 
mixed messages claiming to support 
fossil fuels and American jobs, and 
then issued an executive order disman-
tling the Keystone XL pipeline. 
The United States has achieved en-
ergy independence over the last several 
years. That said, we cannot sit idle and 
watch executive orders dictate the di-
rection of our country with no input 
from Congress. The administration will 
soon fundamentally impact our energy 
independence. The executive branch 
was not created to legislate. Congress 
was. 
Earlier this week, I introduced the 
More Accountability is Necessary Now 
Acts, six pieces of legislation pro-
moting 
accountability 
and 
trans-
parency to the administration’s future 
executive orders. The MANN Acts re-
quire the executive branch to notify 
the American public of its intent to 
issue any new executive orders per-
taining to six specific topics that im-
pact my district, including energy and 
the environment. 
We must hold our elected leaders ac-
countable for the pipeline worker and 
the plant manager, for the farmer and 
rancher, for the millions of lives de-
pending on agriculture and energy 
every day, and for the betterment of 
our democracy. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate Congressman MANN’s in-
volvement in the Western Caucus. 
The voices we have are strong, and 
we will continue to speak loudly and 
clearly about the impact of some of 
these decisions. 
Madam Speaker, you probably have 
guessed that the State of Texas has 
been impacted tremendously by these 
decisions. I am very pleased to have a 
gentleman from the State of Texas. 
Congressman CHIP
ROY
is someone 
whom I have come to know and respect 
for his clearheaded thinking on so 
many different issues, and I know he 
can speak firsthand about the oil and 
gas industry and the impact to our 
economy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for leading this effort. It 
is so critically important, obviously, to 
my great home State of Texas, but also 
to so many States particularly out 
West and, let’s be honest, to all 50 
States of the Union. This is so funda-
mental to who we are as Americans. 
Unfortunately, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are attacking 
the very natural resources and the very 
great strength that the United States 
of America has to set us apart from the 
rest of the world to be independent. We 
were blessed by the good Lord with un-
believable resources, resources that we 
can use for the betterment of man-
kind—our own people, the people in 
this country—for jobs, for affordable 
energy, and for prosperity, and to lead 
the world doing that. 
Unfortunately, we are seeing a mas-
sive attack literally in the first few 
weeks of the new administration: 28 ex-
ecutive orders. A huge number of which 
are obviously targeted at oil and nat-
ural gas, targeted at the lifeblood of 
our energy in this country. 
Madam Speaker, look at what we 
have been able to do with clean-burn-
ing natural gas as a result of fracking. 
We have CO2 levels that are down at 
1990 levels. We have vastly exceeded 
what my leftist friends on the other 
side of the aisle want to follow, the so-
cial welfare state of Europeans down 
the road of fancy gatherings in Davos, 
and they fly in their expensive jets to 
go preach to the world about global 
warming. 
Spare me your preaching as you are 
riding around in these jets spewing out 
CO2 when we, through innovation in 
the great State of Texas and in our 
country, are creating clean-burning 
natural gas. We are creating jobs 
powering the world. 
And now the Democrat administra-
tion wants to come in and destroy jobs, 
destroy our leadership in the world, 
turn us over to Russia and Iran, and, 
oh, by the way, empower China to roll

right over us while they spew out what-
ever they want to spew out because 
darn if they are going to actually do 
anything like agree to whatever is in 
the Paris Agreement. 
It is an absolute joke. It is a laugh-
ingstock what the Democratic Party is 
doing, saying they are standing up for 
the little guy in this country when 
they are going to drive up the price of 
energy, increase CO2, empower China, 
empower Iran, empower Russia, and 
harm jobs. They are going to kill hun-
dreds of thousands of jobs in this coun-
try even as we are coming out of the 
negative effect of the pandemic. 
We have an expression in Texas: 
Come and take it. It goes back to our 
history, our founding as a republic in 
Texas and Gonzalez, when Santa Anna 
wanted his cannon back, and we said: 
Come and take it. 
Well, my message to my Democratic 
colleagues is: We are going to drill and 
we are going to frack. Texas is going to 
continue to lead the world. 
And to my Democratic colleagues: 
Come and take it. 
We are going to stand up for this 
world being able to flourish. Not just 
America, not just Texas, but the world. 
We are exporting liquified natural gas 
around the world, making the world 
better. 
If my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are so concerned about CO2, 
why would they undermine the very 
energy policies that are giving us the 
ability to drive the CO2 level down? 
It makes absolutely no sense. 
So I would just say to the gentleman, 
I greatly appreciate his giving us the 
opportunity here to highlight this. But 
this is just the beginning to my friends 
on the other side of the aisle. 
You roll in here with a new adminis-
tration, roll in here thinking that we 
are going to just fundamentally alter 
our entire economy through executive 
order? 
We are going to say. No. We are going 
to say, Come and take it. That is what 
we are doing. That is what I am here to 
say. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate Mr. ROY’s strong voice and 
leadership on the Republican Con-
ference. I appreciate very much his 
being part of this evening’s discussion. 
Words couldn’t be truer. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank you 
for your attention and listening to the 
message that we have. 
Let me ask you a question: Could you 
imagine if former President Trump had 
signed an executive order during the 
middle of this pandemic to unilaterally 
kill thousands of jobs? 
What would you say would happen? 
It would be a national outrage. 
Well, President Biden’s reckless exec-
utive actions are a national outrage. 
As you have heard, Americans in rural 
communities across the country—in 
fact, in urban areas, too—will suffer be-
cause of this ban. 
The Western Caucus advocates for re-
sponsible land and resource manage-
ment. I can assure you that we will 
continue to be a strong voice for rural 
America. We will do everything in our 
power to fight for their livelihoods in 
the face of these devastating decisions 
by President Biden. So we—I, tonight, 
call on President Biden to please re-
voke and reverse these actions. 
I appreciate your attention, Madam

A BIRD’S EYE VIEW TO INSURRECTION 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take a few minutes to talk 
about my personal account, like so 
many other Members have, on the day 
of January 6. I do so in a poetic, artis-
tic form, with a poem, ‘‘A Bird’s Eye 
View to Insurrection.’’ 
The day started with the humdrum noises of 
a mundane process 
Mahogany boxes were presented, papers shuf-
fled, and gavels knocked, 
But the process of the day was everything, 
The hearing of voices, the counting of votes, 
the sum of democracy. 
I had a bird’s eye view from the gallery 
And on that day, we were in the final steps, 
the technocratic certification, we were 
electing a President 
Meanwhile, at the Ellipse, at base camp, an-
other scene ensued 
A President spewed hateful lies, violence was 
incited, and a fuse was lit 
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, stop 
Objections were raised, debates began, and 
passions heated 
A text reads Capitol Complex breaches 
I rest assured, I am in the safest place on 
Earth, for the people’s House has never 
fallen 
I call my wife to tell her we are safe 
No thought of danger permeates, I am con-
vinced of my safety, and I listen to 
more speeches 
A text reads Capitol Dome breached 
Pence and Pelosi, Hoyer and McCarthy, one- 
by-one they were escorted out 
The debate continued, the people’s represent-
atives continued, and JIM MCGOVERN 
presided 
Debate yields to a prayer by the chaplain 
I am uneasy, fear is in the air, and the Mem-
bers evacuate the House floor 
We dozen or so remain in the gallery strand-
ed 
Banging, banging, banging on the doors 
The insurrectionists are at the Chamber, gas 
masks are deployed, and we are sur-
rounded 
Welch and Gomez, Crow and DeLauro, Himes 
and Costa, Thompson, Wild, Johnson, 
and I 
Together we flee, over chairs and under rail-
ings to the door 
We are trapped 
Bang, bang, bang! Bang, bang, bang! Get 
down! The orders rang. 
Guns, flash bombs, teargas? 
Which sounds these were, I do not know, as 
Capitol Police stood as sentinels to 
protect us 
Get down, get down again, so we did 
I lie flat, behind flimsy plastic seat cov-
erings, no match for bullets, contem-
plating my mortality 
I realize finally and truly in this moment I 
could die 
Army Rangers rise, we lawyers take cover, 
and old souls sit relaxed, waiting 
peacefully, perhaps for the inevitable 
I am cerebral and imagining 
I do not even hear the gunshot, mortally 
wounding a terrorist at the very door 
behind me, and the Chamber finally de-
fended with urgency 
Meanwhile, the Senate Chamber falls with-
out a shot fired 
Police bang the doors, the doors bang back, 
who lurks on the outside 
Confusion changes to clarity and now there’s 
one, and only one, way out 
Up we go and out the door, terrorists lay flat 
with guns drawn upon them, as they 
look at us with killers’ eyes

Partisan cliques form, realizations begin,

dangerous rhetoric turns to violence, 
as the seeds of despicable lies finally 
grow to insurrection 
I start to contemplate 
I am hungry, I am thirsty, and I am sus-

Gomez and I leave the safe room for our of-

I am vaccinated, I am eventually vindicated,

Our colleagues gave it to them, maskless and

I return to our Rayburn sanctuary, I am 
greeted with anxious smiles, my staff 
is safe 
We share the events of the great happening, 
the terrible 
We watch the news, we see the mob in all its 
horror, and the assailing of the Capitol 
walls 
We are in disbelief 
Capitol Police fight hand-to-hand combat, 
they are outnumbered, and beaten by 
flags that say MAGA, Trump, and back 
the blue 
There is a vicious irony 
Now hunger reminds us, snacks are procured, 
we eat creatively in fellowship 
The hours go by in frightful minutes as our 
eyes remain glued to the television 
Brave cooks open the cafeteria, police keep 
their posts, and my staff remain safe in 
the Capitol offices with me 
We finally have a real meal 
The decision has been made, we will return 
to the Chamber, and we will do our 
duty 
Arizona receives its objection and it goes 
down 
Arkansas, California, Colorado go by as

We have a standoff on Pennsylvania 
Debates ensued, liars are called out and an-

PROTECTING OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
before we deal with the purpose of this 
speech, I would like to make some ob-
servations about changes that have 
been made in the last few weeks and 
other 
rapidly 
changing 
aspects 
of 
American life. 
One of the few positive observations I 
have made since I was a Congressman 
is the freedom people have normally 
had to see their Congressmen. Eccen-
tric people can stand at the base of the 
Capitol steps a few yards away and 
hand out their pamphlets, nice and 
free. Easy to meet their Congressmen, 
for those of us who like to walk outside 
and not use the tunnel. 
Now, 
a 
chain-link 
fence 
stands 
around the Capitol with razor wire on 
top. Let’s be honest. After about mid-
night on January 7, I think most of us 
felt pretty safe. 
Now, we are almost a month later, 
and we still have National Guard folks 
in full combat, ready to protect us. We 
have the wire on top of the walls, as 
well as Constitution and Independence 
Avenues shut down. 
I feel like I am in East Germany in 
the 1970s. I am not sure exactly what 
East Germany was like, but that is how 
I kind of visualize it, around maybe 
their parliament or whatever, fencing, 
police, always afraid of the people. 
It is a fitting background for our 
brave new world order in which our 
high-tech oligarchs are censoring ideas. 
Perhaps that is this background to the 
new censor regime. It seems almost ap-
propriate. 
Our high-tech oligarchs are censoring 
ideas which are unpopular with the 
wealthy and powerful in our country. 
Eventually, we will need some anti-
trust enforcement or legislation to 
open up Twitter and allow American 
citizens to hear all points of view, in-
cluding points of view that the great 
and powerful of our country do not 
want to have heard. 
I would like to thank the German, 
Mexican, and French Governments for 
their support as Americans try to re-
gain their roots as a country with a 
free flow of ideas. 
In the meantime, my plea to the 
Speaker and majority leader is please 
tear down the walls around this Capitol 
and begin to undo the damage done to 
our freedoms. 
Now, back to the purpose of the 
speech. 
One more time last week, I returned 
to our southern border, and already, we 
are seeing the results of, I think, reck-
less comments made by our Chief Exec-
utive. 
We are getting to the point where we 
have had 300 unaccompanied minors a 
day crossing our southwest border. 
That is because we have had a Presi-
dent who has made comments that in-
dicate that the United States is not 
sincere in protecting our southern bor-
der. 
b 2130 
It does result in more money and 
more presence for drug cartels at the 
Southern border. So people understand, 
people do not just walk across the bor-
der. Mexicans are charged $3,000 a per-
son; Central Americans, $5,000 a person; 
Brazilians, $9,000 a person; and Asians, 
$20,000 a person to cross the border. 
And when statements are made indi-
cating that we will no longer be enforc-
ing the border, those statements are 
conveyed by the cartels to people who 
they believe will pay to get across. We 
are, therefore, seeing the increase of 
people at the border, including unac-
companied minors who are supposedly 
people we want to protect. 
Last week, on the Sunday, Monday, 
and Tuesday, just in the Sasabe section 
alone, after I left that area, there were 
120 unaccompanied juveniles. Some al-
ready part of a criminal element, but 
given that they have to deal with the 
cartels to get across the border, it cer-
tainly is not a good influence on them. 
Also while I was down there, I heard 
in the last year, on the Tucson sector 
alone—and there are seven or eight sec-
tors along our Southern border—well 
over 100 people were found dehydrated 
to death. This is the result of the cur-
rent system in which we do not secure 
our border. 
Unfortunately, despite the verbiage 
which indicates we are going to be less 
stringent in enforcing our border, we 
are also going to stop building the 
wall. First of all, you are throwing 
away about 5,000 jobs right away, and 
supposedly we are supposed to be look-
ing for new jobs. 
But more than that, when you end 
these contracts, you wind up having to 
pay companies for parts of the wall 
that have been built but haven’t been 
put up yet, pay them to undo or fill in 
holes which have been placed there in 
anticipation of a full wall, pay them to 
undo the damage to roads. And roads 
are part of the wall system that is 
going to be built down there. As a re-
sult, we are spending a lot of money 
which could be used to put in more 
wall and is not. 
I should point out that when you put 
up a wall, it saves money as far as the 
number of Border Patrol agents you 
need. If you don’t have a wall, it should 
take about two or three border agents 
a mile to patrol the border. With a 
wall, it is about one agent for every 
two miles. Another benefit for having a 
wall.

But above all, the idea of paying 
money to wrap up the project rather 
than paying money to complete the 
wall is a waste of money and a real 
problem. 
Another thing I found out, with the 
wall, you are going to have less inju-
ries to Border Patrol agents, which is 
probably one of many reasons why 
when I have gone down at the wall, I 
have yet to find a Border Patrol agent 
or a sheriff’s deputy for the counties 
along the Southern border who is not 
in favor of the wall. 
We are going to wind up losing 
money as we pay money to care for 
people crossing the wall, losing money 
to our society as we have more drugs 
coming across the Southern border. 
And not surprising, as marijuana be-
comes more legal in the United States, 
more of the drugs that cross the South-
ern border are fentanyl, are meth, are 
heroin, resulting in more deaths all 
around the country. Another reason 
why we should be taking our Southern 
border seriously. 
I, therefore, strongly encourage my 
colleagues, as we look at future appro-
priation bills, to pay attention to the 
border. We cannot go back to the days 
of completely anybody can come across 
there, because, like I said, you are 
going to wind up with more people de-
hydrated to death in the desert. You 
are going to wind up with more unac-
companied minors who are going to be 
dealt with by the tender arms of the 
drug cartels, which control all the im-
migration 
and 
illegal 
immigration 
across the Southern border. 
So, please, I ask my colleagues, do 
what I did. Go down to Arizona. Go 
down to Texas. See the situation we 
have. See whether anybody could pos-
sibly think going back to the old sys-
tem is humane in any way. It is not hu-
mane to minors. It is not humane to 
the people who are guided by the car-
tels. It is not humane to the people 
who cross the border and wind up dehy-
drating across our Southern edge. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
LET’S KEEP OUR EYES ON THE 
FUTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS) until 10 p.m. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank you so much for your dedication 
to this body and your oversight this 
evening. I thank all of the very hard-
working professionals who help to run 
the floor of the House. I am so pleased 
to be back on the floor of the House of 
Representatives this day, February 4. 
Some on the outside project fair crit-
icism, question, demand, want of us. 
Some may look at us even with a frus-
trated or loathing eye. We all know 
how often we hear the statistic about 
how popular Congress is. What pours in 
here through money, outside influence, 
the money that circles around this 
building. 
And when we walk onto this floor of 
the House of Representatives, though, 
we are all but just Members. We are 
representatives of our constituents, 
carrying a voting card, carrying a 
voice, representing the values, the de-
terminations, the wishes and the wants 
of our district, and forced to come to-
gether to make a determination. 
We ask ourselves: What do we de-
mand of this institution? 
I had the privilege of being here this 
evening as we have seen a long debate, 
a long time of Special Orders ensue, 
those who reflected on the events of 
January 6, the horrible insurrection 
that took place, the desecration of this 
institution, this pride and joy of the 
United States of America, both the 
House and the Senate momentarily 
taken over. And I join my colleagues in 
those reflections. 
We saw the other side of the aisle re-
flect on energy needs, energy resource 
needs. We also saw some contributions 
made to constituents back at home. 
Tonight, as you look out to the Cap-
itol—and we know this—it is not a full 
Chamber right now. These are obvi-
ously also different times, Madam 
Speaker. We don’t have many outside 
guests walking through the Congress 
due to the pandemic. But everyone is 
allowed to look at the Capitol and see 
the lantern, see the tholus that sup-
ports the Statue of Freedom, that sup-
ports Lady Freedom. That lantern is 
lit right now. 
And what is that lantern saying? 
That democracy rings out, that free-
dom rings out, that our future is still 
within our grasp. 
I am proud and grateful to be here to-
night, Madam Speaker. I know that the 
time is not always a given. We cer-
tainly recognize that in the midst of 
this pandemic. We reflect just a month 
in to this 117th session of Congress. I 
am very excited about this 117th ses-
sion of Congress because it is new. It is 
a new session. 
And what do we get with new? 
A month ago, January 4, the day 
after the swearing-in of the new Con-
gress, we passed our rules package, we 
had procedural votes. I am very proud 
to say I introduced my first bill of the 
Congress, the Resilient Manufacturing 
Task Force Act, a bipartisan bill, fo-
cused on our domestic supply chain 
needs to ensure that we can withstand 
future disruptions, that we can con-
tinue to test our system, that we can 
bring together the best and brightest of 
America to get in front of challenges 
and create jobs and continue to create 
jobs. 
I come from Michigan, and I am real-
ly proud of coming from Michigan and 
I am proud of what Michigan’s story is, 
particularly coming out of the year 
2020, and what that means with regard 
to the first bill I introduced in the 
117th 
Congress, 
our 
manufacturing 
economy, our innovation capabilities. 
We have continued to monitor this 
economy. We are seeing some rico-
chets, some growth in areas we weren’t 
expecting, some job loss. Michigan’s at 
about a 7.5 percent unemployment. We 
are going to build it back better. We 
are going to get people back to work 
with good wages and good benefits and 
a dignity for what they do. You see 
that in manufacturing, when people 
work with their hands, when they 
produce, when they are part of an out-
come and a productivity. And it is real-
ly very exciting to see that Michigan 
will continue to be a leader. 
It must be recognized, our leadership, 
because when those supply chain dis-
ruptions hit almost a year ago, when 
we saw the PPE shortages in our hos-
pitals, in our healthcare system for the 
individual American who was going to 
the grocery store looking for some 
hand sanitizer or a roll of paper towels, 
it was the Michigan manufacturers 
who stood up immediately to rework 
their supply chains, to rework their 
production channels, to source that 
PPE, from the big three—from Ford, 
Chrysler, GM—on down the supply 
chain. And it was absolutely amazing, 
and it was union workers to boot. 
And then the great innovation of 
America, the story that will also be 
heralded and seen coming out of this 
pandemic was the creation of a proven 
and tested vaccine that we invested in 
immediately. My colleagues and I will 
reflect on that, that the first thing we 
did as a body together, all of Congress, 
everyone who gets to stand in this body 
voted to fund the research for the vac-
cine, the very beginning of March. And 
we got that vaccine, and it got pro-
duced in a place called Portage, Michi-
gan. As the year began to reach its 
conclusion, the trucks filled with that 
vaccine, and it started to get in the 
arms of the people who were counting 
on 
it. 
Absolutely 
miraculous. 
So 
unique to the place that I am privi-
leged to call home. 
As we reflected in 2019, on the 50th 
anniversary of the Moon landing, the 
question I would ask my colleagues is: 
What is our moonshot of the next 50 
years? 
We certainly met one in the year 
2020, yet we haven’t stopped continuing 
to innovate. We haven’t stopped con-
tinuing to keep our eyes on a future 
that we are inheriting and that our 
next generation is inheriting. 
I am optimistic about this next gen-
eration. I am optimistic about what 
they represent and about my oppor-
tunity to engage and to listen to the 
students of America and to advocate 
for them from the Halls of Congress. It 
is why I proudly sit on the Education 
and Labor Committee. 
President John Kennedy said: ‘‘To 
govern is to choose.’’ 
To govern is to choose. And we make 
those choices. See, I don’t get to issue 
proclamations instead of voting. I take 
a vote. I come down, ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no.’’ 
Which way do we decide to come 
down as a nation? 
Are we going to agree as a people 
with one another every step of the 
way?

Absolutely not.

No union is perfect in that regard. 
But what makes and builds toward a 
more perfect Union, as our Founders 
compelled, and as we compel each 
other, is the constant dedication to 
doing the work, to standing up for peo-
ple, to calling out truth and what is 
right. 
I certainly am not shy of doing that, 
Madam Speaker, and I know that that 
was important for us at the beginning 
of the pandemic to listen to the 
science, to recognize the threat and to 
take its seriously, and to also be resil-
ient. And I see that resilience all 
around my district, Madam Speaker. 
And I continue to be compelled to the 
constituents of the 11th District, to the 
falling COVID rates in Michigan. We 
continue to pay tribute and to recog-
nize those who are suffering, those who 
are struggling from COVID–19, families 
who are separated from one another as 
an individual is getting their treat-
ment. We hold them in our hearts. We 
think about them and we remain dedi-
cated to the prevention and the cure 
and the effort to end this pandemic. 
I am so excited to welcome President 
Joe Biden to the White House. We were 
here for his inauguration. We were here 
to hear his remarks. His invitation for 
unity and unity by way of delivering; 
unity by way of delivering for the 
American people; the Buy American 
provisions that will continue to invest 
in American manufacturers and using 
our Federal dollars to identify new sup-
ply chain opportunities for us. 
I see this all over my district, from 
Northville up to Troy and Auburn 
Hills, what people are working on and 
how we can help them to continue to 
do that. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for the 
time tonight and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PUBLICATION OF COMMITTEE 
RULES 
RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
FOR THE 117TH CONGRESS 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, February 4, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to Rule 
XI, Clause 2(a) of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives, I respectfully submit the 
rules of the 117th Congress for the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs for publication in 
the Congressional Record. The Committee 
adopted these rules by a voice vote, with a 
quorum being present, at our organizational 
meeting on Wednesday, February 3, 2021. 
Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chariman. 
(Adopted February 3, 2021)

pense with the first reading (in full) of a bill 
or resolution, if printed copies are available, 
are privileged non-debatable motions in 
Committee. 
(c) The Chairman of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs shall consult the Ranking 
Minority Member to the extent possible with 
respect to the business of the Committee. 
Each subcommittee of the Committee is a 
part of the Committee and is subject to the 
authority and direction of the Committee 
and to its rules, to the extent applicable. 
2. DATE OF MEETING 
The regular meeting date of the Com-
mittee shall be the first Tuesday of every 
month when the House of Representatives is 
in session pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XI 
of the House of Representatives. Additional 
meetings may be called by the Chairman as 
the Chairman may deem necessary or at the 
request of a majority of the Members of the 
Committee in accordance with clause 2(c) of 
rule XI of the House of Representatives. The 
determination of the business to be consid-
ered at each meeting shall be made by the 
Chairman subject to clause 2(c) of rule XI of 
the House of Representatives. A regularly 
scheduled meeting need not be held if, in the 
judgment of the Chairman, there is no busi-
ness to be considered. 
3. QUORUM 
For purposes of taking testimony and re-
ceiving evidence, two Members shall con-
stitute a quorum, and the Chairman of the 
full Committee or a subcommittee shall 
make every effort to ensure that the rel-
evant Ranking Minority Member or another 
Minority Member is present at the time a 
hearing is convened. One-third of the Mem-
bers of the Committee or subcommittee shall 
constitute a quorum for taking any action, 
except: (1) reporting a measure or rec-
ommendation; (2) closing Committee meet-
ings and hearings to the public; (3) author-
izing the issuance of subpoenas; and (4) any 
other action for which an actual majority 
quorum is required by any rule of the House 
of Representatives or by law. No measure or 
recommendation shall be reported to the 
House of Representatives unless a majority 
of the Committee is actually present. No 
measure or recommendation shall be re-
ported to the full Committee by a sub-
committee unless half of the subcommittee 
is actually present. A record vote may be de-
manded by one-fifth of the Members present 
or, in the apparent absence of a quorum, by 
any one Member. 
4. MEETINGS AND HEARINGS OPEN TO THE 
PUBLIC 
(a) Meetings: 
(1) Each meeting for the transaction of 
business, including the markup of legisla-
tion, of the Committee or a subcommittee 
shall be open to the public except when the 
Committee or subcommittee, in open session 
and with a majority present, determines by 
record vote that all or part of the remainder 
of the meeting on that day shall be closed to 
the public, because disclosure of matters to 
be considered would endanger national secu-
rity, would compromise sensitive law en-
forcement information, or would tend to de-
fame, degrade or incriminate any person or 
otherwise violate any labor rule of the House 
of Representatives. No person, other than 
Members of the Committee and such con-
gressional staff and departmental represent-
atives as the Committee or subcommittee 
may authorize, shall be present at any busi-
ness or markup session which has been 
closed to the public. This subsection does not 
apply to open Committee hearings which are 
provided for by subsection (b) of this rule. 
(2) The Chairman of the full Committee or 
a subcommittee may postpone further pro-
ceedings when a record vote is ordered on the 
question of approving any measure or mat-
ter, or adopting an amendment. The relevant 
Chairman may resume proceedings on a post-
poned request at any time. When exercising 
postponement authority, the relevant Chair-
man shall take all reasonable steps nec-
essary to notify Members on the resumption 
of proceedings on any postponed record vote. 
When proceedings resume on a postponed 
question, notwithstanding any intervening 
order for the previous question, an under-
lying proposition shall remain subject to fur-
ther debate or amendment to the same ex-
tent as when the question was postponed. 
(b) Hearings: 
(1) Each hearing conducted by the Com-
mittee or a subcommittee shall be open to 
the public except when the Committee or 
subcommittee, in open session and with a 
majority present, determines by record vote 
that all or part of the remainder of that 
hearing on that day should be closed to the 
public because disclosure of testimony, evi-
dence or other matters to be considered 
would endanger the national security, would 
compromise sensitive law enforcement infor-
mation, or otherwise would violate any law 
or rule of the House of Representatives. Not-
withstanding the preceding sentence, a ma-
jority of those present, there being in at-
tendance the requisite number required 
under the rules of the Committee to be 
present for the purpose of taking testi-
mony— 
(A) may vote to close the hearing for the 
sole purpose of discussing whether testimony 
or evidence to be received would endanger 
the national security, would compromise 
sensitive law enforcement information, or 
violate paragraph (2) of this subsection; or 
(B) may vote to close the hearing, as pro-
vided in paragraph (2) of this subsection. 
(2) Whenever it is asserted by a Member of 
the Committee that the evidence or testi-
mony at a hearing may tend to defame, de-
grade, or incriminate any person, or it is as-
serted by a witness that the evidence or tes-
timony that the witness would give at a 
hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or in-
criminate the witness— 
(A) such testimony or evidence shall be 
presented in executive session, notwith-
standing the provisions of paragraph (1) of 
this subsection, if by a majority of those 
present, there being in attendance the req-
uisite number required under the rules of the 
Committee to be present for the purpose of 
taking testimony, the Committee or sub-
committee determines that such evidence or 
testimony may tend to defame, degrade, or 
incriminate any person; and 
(B) the Committee or subcommittee shall 
proceed to receive such testimony in open 
session only if the Committee, a majority 
being present, determines that such evidence 
or testimony will not tend to defame, de-
grade, or incriminate any person. 
(3) No Member of the House of Representa-
tives 
may 
be 
excluded 
from 
non- 
participatory attendance at any hearing of 
the Committee or a subcommittee unless the 
House of Representatives has by majority 
vote authorized the Committee or sub-
committee, for purposes of a particular se-
ries of hearings, on a particular article of 
legislation or on a particular subject of in-
vestigation, to close its hearings to Members 
by the same procedures designated in this 
subsection for closing hearings to the public. 
(4) A Member of the House of Representa-
tives who is not a Member of the Committee 
may not be recognized to participate in a 
Committee or Subcommittee hearing except 
by the unanimous consent of Committee 
Members 
present 
at 
such 
hearing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H377 
February 4, 2021 
Participatory recognition of a non-Com-
mittee Member shall occur only after all 
Committee Members seeking recognition, 
both majority and minority, have had their 
opportunity to participate and question any 
witnesses. 
(5) The Committee or a subcommittee may 
by the procedure designated in this sub-
section vote to close one (1) subsequent day 
of hearing. 
(6) No congressional staff shall be present

of Representatives. 
5. CONVENING HEARINGS AND MARKUPS 
(a) Hearings: 
(1) Notice. Public announcement shall be 
made of the date, place, and subject matter 
of any hearing to be conducted by the Com-
mittee or a subcommittee at the earliest 
possible date, and in any event at least one 
(1) week before the commencement of that 
hearing. If the Chairman of the full Com-
mittee or a subcommittee, with the concur-
rence of the relevant Ranking Minority 
Member, determines that there is good cause 
to begin a hearing sooner, or if the Com-
mittee or subcommittee so determines by 
majority vote in the presence of the number 
of members required under the rules of the 
Committee for the taking of action, the 
Chairman of the full Committee, if concur-
ring, shall make the announcement at the 
earliest possible date. No change shall be 
made to a publicly announced hearing title 
until after consultation with the relevant 
Ranking Minority Member and notice to pre-
viously announced witnesses. 
(2) Member Day Hearing. During the first 
session of each Congress, the full Committee 
shall hold a hearing at which it receives tes-
timony from Members, Delegates, and the 
Resident Commissioner on proposed legisla-
tion within its jurisdiction. 
(b) Markups and Other Meetings to Trans-
act Business: 
(1) Convening. The Chairman of the full 
Committee or a subcommittee may call or 
convene, as the relevant Chairman considers 
necessary, meetings of the Committee or 
subcommittee for the consideration of a bill 
or resolution pending before the Committee 
or subcommittee, as the case may be, or for 
the conduct of other Committee or sub-
committee business. 
(2) Notice. Public announcement shall be 
made by the Chairman of the full Committee 
of the date, place, and subject matter of any 
markup or other meeting to conduct busi-
ness at the earliest possible date, and in any 
event at least one (1) week before the com-
mencement of such markup or meeting, un-
less the relevant Chairman determines, in 
consultation with the relevant Ranking Mi-
nority Member, that there is good cause to 
begin such a markup or meeting on an ear-
lier date. If such determination is made, the 
Chairman of the full Committee, if concur-
ring in that determination, shall make the 
announcement at the earliest possible date. 
(3) Agenda and Texts. The relevant Chair-
man shall provide to all Committee or sub-
committee Members an agenda for each 
Committee and subcommittee markup or 
other meeting to transact business, setting 
out all items of business to be considered, in-
cluding whenever possible a copy of any 
measure scheduled for markup, at least 48 
hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
legal holidays) before the meeting. 
Bills on subjects not listed on such agenda 
shall be subject to a point of order unless 
their consideration is agreed to by a two- 
thirds vote of the Committee or sub-
committee, or by the Chairman of the full 
Committee with the concurrence of the 
Ranking Minority Member. The text of any 
measure to be marked up shall be made pub-
licly available in electronic form at least 24 
hours prior to the commencement of the 
markup meeting, or at the time of an an-
nouncement under subparagraph (b)(2) made 
within 24 hours before such meeting. 
(c) Publication. Public announcement of 
all hearings and markups shall be published 
in the Daily Digest portion of the Congres-
sional Record and made publicly available in 
electronic form. Members shall be notified

ing markups and hearings) and briefings of 
subcommittees and of the full Committee. 
(d) Member Seating. During Committee 
and subcommittee hearings and markups, 
chairs on the dais are for Members. No staff 
member other than a Committee or sub-
committee staff director, counsel, or profes-
sional staff member may occupy a chair on

mittee. Only one staff member each from the 
majority and the minority may occupy

ing or markup. 
6. WITNESSES 
(a) Interrogation of Witnesses: 
(1) In so far as practicable, witnesses shall 
be permitted to present their oral state-
ments without interruption subject to rea-
sonable time constraints imposed by the 
Chairman of the full Committee or a sub-
committee, with questioning by the Com-
mittee Members taking place afterward. 
Members should refrain from questions until 
such statements are completed. 
(2) In recognizing Members, the relevant 
Chairman shall, to the extent practicable, 
give preference to the Members on the basis 
of their arrival at the hearing, taking into 
consideration the majority and minority 
ratio of the Members actually present. A 
Member desiring to speak or ask a question 
shall address the relevant Chairman and not 
the witness. 
(3) Subject to paragraph (4), each Member 
may interrogate the witness for 5 minutes, 
the reply of the witness being included in the 
5–minute period. After all Members have had 
an opportunity to ask questions, the round 
shall begin again under the 5–minute rule. 
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the rel-
evant Chairman, with the concurrence of the 
Ranking Minority Member, may permit one 
(1) or more majority Members of the Com-
mittee designated by the relevant Chairman 
to question a witness for a specified period of 
not longer than 30 minutes. On such occa-
sions, an equal number of minority Members 
of the Committee designated by the Ranking 
Minority Member shall be permitted to ques-
tion the same witness for the same period of 
time. Committee staff may be permitted to 
question a witness for equal specified periods 
either with the concurrence of the Chairman 
and Ranking Minority Member of the full 
Committee or by motion. However, in no 
case may questioning by Committee staff 
proceed before each Member of the Com-
mittee who wishes to speak under the 5– 
minute rule has had one opportunity to do 
so. 
(b) Testimony of Witnesses: 
(1) Advance Filing Requirement. Each wit-
ness who is to appear before the Committee 
or a subcommittee is required to file testi-
mony with the Committee or subcommittee 
at least two (2) business days in advance of 
that appearance. For purposes of this sub-
section, testimony includes the written 
statement of a witness, as well as any video, 
photographs, audio-visual matter, posters, or 
other supporting materials that the witness 
intends to present or display before the Com-
mittee. Such testimony should be provided 
in electronic form to the extent practicable. 
The Committee or subcommittee shall notify 
Members at least two business days in ad-
vance of a hearing of the availability of tes-
timony submitted by witnesses. In addition, 
each witness shall provide sufficient copies, 
as determined by the Chairman of the full 
Committee or a subcommittee, of his or her 
proposed written statement to be provided to 
Members and staff of the Committee or sub-
committee, the news media, and the general 
public. The text of the written statement 
provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
considered final, and may not be revised by 
the witness after the Committee meeting at 
which the witness appears. 
(2) Witness Preclusion and Waiver. The re-
quirements of paragraph (1) or any part 
thereof may be waived by the Chairman of 
the full Committee or a subcommittee, or 
the presiding Member, or the Ranking Mem-
ber of the Committee or subcommittee as it 
relates to witnesses who are called by the 
minority to testify, provided that the wit-
ness or the relevant Chairman or Ranking 
Minority Member has submitted, prior to the 
witness’s appearance, a written explanation 
to the reasons testimony has not been made 
available 
to 
the 
Committee 
or 
sub-
committee. If a witness who is not an official 
of the U.S. Government has not submitted 
testimony as required by paragraph (1) and 
no such written explanation has been sub-
mitted, the witness shall be released from 
testifying unless a majority of the Com-
mittee or subcommittee votes to accept his 
or her testimony. 
(3) Remote Witness Participation. The 
Chairman of the full Committee or a sub-
committee shall promptly, and not later 
than 48 hours beforehand if possible, notify 
the relevant Ranking Member of any witness 
who is likely to present testimony other 
than in person, such as by videoconference. 
A witness may not testify via telephone or 
other audio-only medium without the con-
currence of the Chairman and Ranking Mem-
ber of the Committee or subcommittee. The 
relevant Chairman shall make reasonable ef-
forts to verify the identity of any witness 
participating remotely. 
(4) ‘Truth In Testimony’ Disclosure. In the 
case of a witness appearing in a nongovern-
mental capacity, a written statement of pro-
posed testimony shall, to the extent prac-
ticable, include: a curriculum vitae; a disclo-
sure of the amount and source of any Federal 
grant (or subgrant thereof) or contract (or 
subcontract thereof), or of any contract, 
grant or payment originating with a foreign 
government, received during the past 36 
months by the witness or by an entity rep-
resented by the witness and related to the 
subject matter of, and the witness’ represen-
tational capacity at, the hearing; a disclo-
sure of whether the witness is negotiating or 
awaiting approval to receive a contract with, 
a grant or payment from a foreign govern-
ment; and a disclosure of whether the wit-
ness is fiduciary (including, but not limited 
to, a director, officer, advisor, or resident 
agent) of any organization or entity that has 
an interest in the subject matter of the hear-
ing or an active registrant under the Foreign 
Agents 
Registration 
Act 
(FARA). 
Such 
statements, with appropriate redactions to 
protect the privacy, safety, or security of the 
witness, shall be made publicly available in 
electronic form 24 hours before the witness 
appears to the extent practicable, but not 
later than one day after the witness appears. 
(5) Witness Presentation. A witness shall 
limit his or her oral presentation to a brief 
summary of his or her written statement.

such transcript and such transcript has not 
been returned within such time. 
The records of the Committee at the Na-
tional Archives and Records Administration 
shall be made available for public use in ac-

offices and shall be available for public in-
spection during normal business hours. Ex-
cept in extraordinary circumstances, no

security clearances, when they have exe-
cuted the oath required by clause 13 of rule

ber of his or her staff as having the right of 
access to information classified Confidential. 
Such designated persons must have the prop-
er security clearance, have executed the oath

classified Top Secret which has been fur-
nished to the Committee pursuant to section 
36 of the Arms Export Control Act, as

person shall be by letter from the Committee 
Member to the Chairman.

tial or Secret may be taken from Committee 
offices to other Committee offices and hear-
ing rooms by Members of the Committee and 
authorized Committee staff in connection 
with hearings and briefings of the Com-
mittee or its subcommittees for which such 
information is deemed to be essential. Re-
moval of such information from the Com-
mittee offices shall be only with the permis-
sion of the Chairman under procedures de-
signed to ensure the safe handling and stor-
age of such information at all times. Except 
as provided in this paragraph, Top Secret 
materials may not be taken from approved 
storage areas for any purpose, except that 
such materials may be taken to hearings and 
other meetings that are being conducted at 
the Top Secret level when necessary. Mate-
rials classified Top Secret may otherwise be 
used under conditions approved by the Chair-
man after consultation with the Ranking Mi-
nority Member. 
(e) Notice. Appropriate notice of the re-
ceipt of classified documents received by the 
Committee from the Executive Branch will 
be sent promptly to Committee Members 
through the Survey of Activities or by other 
means.

otherwise restricted held by the Committee 
will be in approved Committee spaces. The 
following procedures will be observed: 
(1) Authorized persons will be permitted 
access to classified documents after inquir-
ing of the Staff Director or an assigned staff 
member. Access to the SCIF will be afforded 
during regular Committee hours. 
(2) Authorized persons will be required to 
identify themselves, to identify the docu-
ments or information they wish to view, and 
to sign the Classified Materials Log, which is 
kept with the classified information. 
(3) The assigned staff member will be re-
sponsible for maintaining a log which identi-
fies: (1) authorized persons seeking access, 
(2) the classified information requested, and 
(3) the time of arrival and departure of such 
persons. The assigned staff member will also 
assure that the classified materials are re-
turned to the proper location. 
(g) Divulgence. Classified information pro-
vided to the Committee by the Executive 
Branch shall be handled in accordance with 
the procedures that apply within the Execu-
tive Branch for the protection of such infor-
mation. Any classified information to which 
access has been gained through the Com-
mittee may not be divulged to any unauthor-
ized person. Classified material shall not be 
photocopied or otherwise reproduced. In no 
event shall classified information be dis-
cussed in a non-secure environment. Appar-
ent violations of this rule should be reported 
as promptly as possible to the Chairman for 
appropriate action. 
(h) Other Regulations. The Chairman, after 
consultation with the Ranking Minority 
Member, may establish such additional regu-
lations and procedures as in his judgment 
may be necessary to safeguard classified in-
formation under the control of the Com-
mittee. Members of the Committee will be 
given notice of any such regulations and pro-
cedures promptly. They may be modified or 
waived in any or all particulars by a major-
ity vote of the full Committee.

any such witness who does not wish to be 
subjected to radio, television, Internet or 
still photography coverage, all lenses shall 
be covered and all microphones used for cov-

plementary to clause 2(k)(5) of rule XI of the

fixed positions but shall not be placed in po-

any method of coverage of the hearing or 
meeting, except that the television media 
may install additional lighting in the hear-
ing room, without cost to the Government, 
in order to raise the ambient lighting level 
in the hearing room to the lowest level nec-
essary to provide adequate television cov-
erage of the hearing or meeting at the cur-
rent state-of-the art level of television cov-
erage.

HONORING THE LIVES OF FBI SPE-
CIAL 
AGENTS 
DANIEL 
ALFIN 
AND 
LAURA 
SCHWARTZENBERGER 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the lives of two fallen FBI agents, Dan-
iel Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger. 
While executing a federal warrant in a child 
exploitation investigation, Special Agent Daniel 
Alfin 
and 
Special 
Agent 
Laura 
Schwartzenberger were shot and killed in the 
line of duty in Sunrise, Florida. 
They died protecting our most vulnerable 
citizens and the community they loved. 
This was sadly the FBI’s deadliest day since 
the tragic events on 9/11. It has also been 
more than 30 years since two agents were 
gunned down together in the line of duty. 
A 16-year veteran of the FBI, Special Agent 
Laura Schwartzenberger’s specialty was pur-
suing crimes against children. 
Her work with the FBl’s Miami Field Office’s 
Innocent Images National Initiative led to the 
arrests of those involved in the exploitation of 
children and ‘‘sextortion.’’ She leaves behind a 
husband and two children. 
Special Agent Daniel Alfin was a 12-year 
veteran of the FBI. He was a veteran agent 
who led the investigation into a dark web site 
called Playpen, one of the country’s largest 
child pornography operations. He also leaves 
behind a wife and one child. 
While I did not have the good fortune of 
knowing these two Special Agents, I know 
this—these were two brave individuals taken 
from us and we lost them way too soon. 
These were incredible parents, ripped from 
their families before their time. They were ex-
traordinary public servants trying to make our 
community a safer place to raise our families. 
To their families and loved ones, I struggle 
to find words that can offer solace and comfort 
in their time of distress. 
The great poet William Wordsworth once 
said, ‘‘Not without hope we suffer and we 
mourn.’’ 
Perhaps he meant that we find hope in the 
belief that our thoughts and prayers will in 
time heal their families, and in the hope and 
belief that the children of these fallen heroes 
will grow up knowing that their parents made 
this sacrifice to make their world and our world 
a better place. 
Agents Alfin and Schwartzenberger put their 
lives on the line every day to make us safer. 
We lost them to a senseless act of violence 
by someone with a total disregard for the lives 
of others. 
We grieve their loss not only to the commu-
nity they served, but to the families and loved 
ones they leave behind. 
They made the ultimate sacrifice, and we 
will be forever grateful. 
ROE V. WADE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to commemorate the 48th anniversary of 
the tragic Roe versus Wade Supreme Court 
Decision. That fateful decision has ended the 
loss of over 62 million unborn babies’ lives. 
Consider that while America is the land of 
opportunity, more than 62 million unborn 
Americans were given no opportunity to pur-
sue the incredible opportunities our great na-
tion affords. 
At home and abroad, the unborn are under 
attack. Our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle disastrously intend to burden the con-
sciences of millions of Americans by forcing 
them to use their hard-earned tax dollars to 
subsidize abortion. 
I’m also deeply concerned by the current 
administration’s decision to rescind the Mexico 
City Policy and instead force taxpayers to fund 
abortions overseas. 
In fact, recent polling shows that three-quar-
ters of Americans want significant restrictions 
on abortion. 
If we are truly representing the American 
people, we will work as a Congress to pass 
abortion restrictions here in these halls. 
Until that happens, I will continue fighting 
tirelessly to defend the sanctity of unborn 
lives.

EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND 
JOBS PARITY ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN Madam Speaker, today, I intro-
duce the Employment Services and Jobs Par-
ity Act. This legislation would make long over-
due amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act to 
include the Northern Mariana Islands and 
American Samoa. 
The Wagner-Peyser Act established the 
Employment Service which brings together 
employers looking for workers and individuals 
looking for work. Despite participating in Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act programs 
and operating an American Job Center, the 
Marianas and American Samoa are not eligi-
ble for the employment services formula grant 
that is currently awarded to all other states 
and insular areas. 
In January 2017, the 902 report was sub-
mitted to Congress. Both the Special Rep-
resentatives of the Marianas and the President 
recommended that the Department of Interior 
work cooperatively with DOL to extend the 
Wagner-Peyser Act to the Marianas. But, it will 
be up to Congress to act so that all Americans 
can get the help they need to develop the 
skills necessary to enter in-demand jobs and 
career paths. 
With widespread unemployment due to the 
coronavirus, the annual Wagner-Peyser grant 
would provide timely support to the Marianas 
and American Samoan workforce through 
skills assessment, career guidance, and refer-
rals to training for job seekers. 
Now is the time to make things right and en-
sure parity for all Americans. This bipartisan 
bill is important to the workers in the Marianas 
and American Samoa. The Representative 
from American Samoa, Mrs. RADEWAGEN, is 
an original co-sponsor. I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

IN RECOGNITION OF LLOYD 
ELLEFSON’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor World War II veteran Lloyd 
Ellefson as he celebrates his 100th birthday. 
Mr. Ellefson grew up in Appleton, Wisconsin 
on his family’s farm. In 1942, his 21st birthday, 
Lloyd registered for the draft and joined the 
U.S. Army. Lloyd was stationed at Fort Sill in 
Oklahoma, where he trained as an auto me-
chanic with the 93rd Armored Field Artillery. 
Lloyd served under General George Patton 
in both France and Italy during WWII. He was 
first stationed in Naples, Italy where he re-
members being ‘‘boomed’’ by the German Air 
Force. Lloyd’s service then brought him to the 
shores of Southern France where he recalls 
seeing all the ships waiting in the calm waters 
of the Bay before the fighting began. Lloyd 
was the only mechanic sent to the D-Day in-
vasion, and he and his battalion received a 
Bronze Arrowhead for their service and brav-
ery in the invasion. 
Beloved husband, father, grandfather and 
soldier, Lloyd is a tribute to the ‘‘Greatest 
Generation’’ and a grateful nation and state 
thank him for his service. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in applauding Lloyd Ellefson 
for his service in WWII and wishing him a 
happy and healthy 100th birthday.

HONORING PAM RUDD 
HON. JAMES COMER

for Hopkinsville Parks and Recreation part- 
time while serving as a physical education 
teacher. Upon her retirement from the school 
system in 1977, Ms. Rudd worked full-time as 
program coordinator for Hopkinsville Parks 
end Recreation. While at the department, she 
had served under nine directors, including a 
stint of her own as interim director from 2005 
to 2007. As program coordinator, Ms. Rudd 
has played an integral role in the department’s 
transition from a city-county entity to the city- 
managed Hopkinsville Parks and Recreation 
Department. She also played a lead role in the 
design and planning of Hopkinsville’s award- 
winning Tie-Breaker Baseball Softball complex 
in 2001, which would go on to serve many 
children in the region. Pam’s years of service 
came to a summit when Ms. Rudd was recog-
nized as a Kentucky Recreation and Parks 
Society Fellow in 2015. She was also fittingly 
selected for the Kentucky Recreation and 
Parks Society Hall of Fame in 2019. I am hon-
ored to share the exceptional history of Ms. 
Rudd’s six-decade career. I want to thank Ms. 
Rudd for being an extraordinary leader to her 
community and the 1st Congressional District 
of Kentucky.

IN HONOR OF MARINETTE F. 
‘‘MARI’’ BARB 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember Marinette F. ‘‘Mari’’ Barb of 
Williamsburg, VA. Mari passed away on Janu-
ary 20, 2021 after more than a century of life. 
Mari bravely served the United States for 
many years, and her life after service was 
equally memorable and noteworthy. 
Mari was born on September 16, 1919 in a 
small town in the south of France. Two dec-
ades later, she joined the French Underground 
when her home country was occupied by Nazi 
Germany. During this time, Mari worked with 
the O.S.S., the predecessor of the CIA. Mari 
constantly risked her life, helping Allied sol-
diers and airmen who found themselves be-
hind enemy lines. Using forged Algerian identi-
fication papers, Mari saved the lives of count-
less soldiers by smuggling them back to Allied 
territory. 
Immediately after the war, Mari met her hus-
band, James, while he was in France with the 
U.S. Army. She moved to the United States 
with Jim and was made an American citizen 
by an Act of Congress. A career in intelligence 
took Mari and Jim to the Pacific Island of 
Saipan, on two tours in Vietnam, and took 
Mari to Hong Kong for an extended stay. Mari 
and Jim made frequent returns to Camp Peary 
in Williamsburg between overseas assign-
ments. 
Once they retired, Mari and Jim moved to 
Williamsburg, VA permanently. There they be-
came staples of the community, frequenting 
trivia nights and live music venues. In addition 
to retiring from work, Mari retired from cook-
ing, so Mari and Jim could always be found at 
one of their favorite restaurants. Mari is sur-
vived by three sisters and many family mem-
bers spread across both France and the 
United States. Madam Speaker, I ask you rise 
with me in memory of Marinette F. Barb. She 
will be profoundly missed, but her memory 
lives on in her friends and family.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER AND 
LEGACY OF HAMILTON COUNTY 
JUDGE ETHNA COOPER 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Judge Ethna Cooper for her 
many years of service to Hamilton County and 
its residents. 
Judge Cooper was appointed to the Ham-
ilton County Court of Common Pleas by Gov-
ernor Taft in 2003. 
In addition to her service on the Court, 
Judge Cooper founded and has served as the 
Presiding Judge of the Hamilton County Fel-
ony Veterans’ Treatment Court since 2011. 
This court was the first Felony Veterans’ 
Treatment Court in the United States, ad-
dressing the issues that led to a veteran’s 
contact with the criminal justice system. 
Judge Cooper has served Hamilton County 
with diligence and honor. 
I want to thank Judge Cooper again and 
wish her the best in the future.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
DEBORAH MOSELEY 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of Deborah ‘‘Debbie’’ 
Moseley, the Executive Director of The Bridge 
Over Troubled Waters in Pasadena, Texas. 
Commonly referred to as ‘‘The Bridge,’’ this 
organization has assisted men, women, and 
children affected by domestic and sexual vio-
lence or homelessness in southeastern Harris 
County, Texas. For thirty-four years, Debbie 
has served the organization as an advocate in 
the field of domestic and sexual violence. 
Debbie began working as a volunteer at The 
Bridge in 1986 alongside her mother and 
grandmother. A year later, she started working 
with The Bridge’s children’s programs on 
Tuesday and Thursday evenings. In 1988, 
Debbie began to work full-time at The Bridge 
as a Resident Advocate. Over the years, she 
has held many leadership positions in each of 
the different programs that The Bridge offers, 
including Shelter Coordinator, Resale Shop 
Coordinator, Non-Resident Director, and Advo-
cacy Director. In 2003, Debbie was named the 
Executive Director and has served in that role 
ever since. 
Under Debbie’s leadership, The Bridge con-
nected with community leaders and the com-
munity at-large, built a new location, and start-
ed Destiny Village—a long-term housing pro-
gram for survivors of violence with disabilities 
and children. In addition, she has significantly 
increased the Bridge’s share of funding grant-
ed by the Victims of Crime Act to provide crit-
ical support services to victims of domestic vi-
olence. 
Debbie is a Licensed Social Worker and has 
dedicated her life to community and volunteer 
service. She serves on the boards of numer-
ous community organizations such as: the 
Harris County Coordinating Council, the Texas 
Council on Family Violence, the Harris County 
Adult Fatality Review Team, the Pasadena 
Chamber of Commerce, the Pasadena Police 
Academy, and the Bridges to Life prison min-
istry. She is also active in the New Hope 
Church of Pearland, the Pasadena Kiwanis, 
the Bay Area Kiwanis, the Pasadena Rotary, 
the Salvation Army, and the Texas Invitational. 
For her community and civic involvement, 
Debbie has received numerous recognitions 
including: the Governor’s Victim Services Divi-
sion ‘‘Pathfinder’’ Award in 2007, Debbie 
Moseley Day in Pasadena Texas, the Rotary 
Club’s Paul Harris Fellow Award in 2010, Ro-
tary Director of the Year in 2016, and the Stel-
la Trimble Community Service Award in 2017. 
In 1985, Debbie married the love of her life, 
Tom Moseley. Debbie is the mother to four 
children: John Miles of Burleson, Texas; Aaron 
Miles, also of Burleson; Derek Miles of League 
City; and Staff Sergeant Josh Moseley, who is 
stationed as a United States Marine Corps re-
cruiter in Arlington, Texas. Debbie and Tom 
are the proud grandparents of eight grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
Debbie Moseley for her lifetime of dedicated 
service to the survivors of domestic and sex-
ual violence and wish her the very best during 
her well-deserved retirement.

CAPTAIN DAVID SAGEL 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Captain David Sagel of the 
Westminster Fire Department who passed 
away on January 24, 2021 after courageously 
battling work-related cancer for more than a 
year and a half. 
Captain Sagel served in the Westminster 
Fire Department for 34 years, in roles as a 
firefighter and engineer to lieutenant and cap-
tain. Throughout his career, Captain Sagel 
was best known for his passion for community 
service. In his off-duty time, he instituted and 
led a foster home renovation program where 
he worked with Adams and Jefferson Counties 
to identify foster homes in need of repairs and 
recruited the help of other fire department 
members and local businesses to assist in 
renovating them at no cost to the families. For 
many years, he served as the organizer for 
the ‘‘Hot Times KOOL Cars’’ event in conjunc-
tion with KOOL 105.1 FM, which was an an-
nual car show that raised money for Children’s 
Hospital of Colorado. 
Captain Sagel’s passing during Fire Fighter 
Cancer Awareness Month is an important re-
minder to redouble Congress’ efforts to pre-
vent occupational cancers of firefighters and 
invest in additional healthcare research and 
development of new safety equipment to pro-
tect firefighters as they work to protect our 
communities. 
Captain Sagel was a beloved and devoted 
husband and a loving father. He was a master 
craftsman who loved woodworking and restor-
ing cars and tractors. He spent his free time

2021 LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on Monday I had the opportunity to 
announce my 2021 Legislative Agenda by 
hosting with my wife Roxane, press con-
ferences across the Second District of South 
Carolina in West Columbia, Aiken, North Au-
gusta, Barnwell, with presentations in Orange-
burg and Lexington. My legislative priorities for 
this year begin with defeating the pandemic by 
working with the Governor Henry McMaster to 
improve testing and ensure fast access to a 
safe vaccine. This year’s agenda also focuses 
on creating jobs and economic growth by pro-
tecting ‘Right to Work’ laws in South Carolina 
and advocating for current and future missions 
at the Savannah River Site. 
This year more than ever before it is impor-
tant to promote conservative, limited govern-
ment solutions. The 2021 agenda includes 
supporting a Balanced Budget Amendment to 
the Constitution and supporting our police. I 
will also continue to promote peace through 
strength and ensure the security of our coun-
try, strengthen alliances for information and 
medical resource sharing, and support military 
families. 
In conclusion, God Bless Our Troops and 
we will never forget September 11th in the 
Global War on Terrorism.

Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, this past 
January 22 marked the 48th anniversary of 
the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision. 
Now more than ever, America must continue 
to unapologetically stand for the sanctity of all 
human life. As the representative of Kansas’ 
Second Congressional District, my constitu-
ents can be assured that I will always protect 
pro-life values at home and in Washington. I 
promised that I would be a fearless pro-life ad-
vocate throughout my public service, and I will 
keep my word to those who elected me. 
In Kansas, I am proud to put my full support 
behind the ‘‘Value Them Both Amendment’’ 
that recently passed the Kansas Legislature. 
Currently, there is a legal basis for an unre-
stricted, unlimited abortion access in Kansas 
due to the Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt deci-
sion handed down by our liberal Kansas Su-
preme Court. The Value Them Both Amend-
ment will allow for commonsense regulation 
on the abortion industry that protects babies 
and mothers. Thankfully, both the Kansas 
House and Senate passed the constitutional 
amendment by a two-thirds vote. Now the vot-
ers of Kansas will have the final say during a 
statewide election in 2022, where I am con-
fident Kansans will choose life. 
I will always unapologetically defend the 
sanctity of all human life, especially the most 
vulnerable among us—the unborn. I promised 
that I would be a fearless pro-life advocate 
throughout my public service, and I will keep 
my word to those who elected me to serve in 
Congress. After being sworn into office on 
January 3rd, I immediately joined the Con-
gressional Pro-Life Caucus as my first con-
gressional caucus and cosponsored several 
key pieces legislation which would defund 
Planned Parenthood, prohibit any abortion 
after 20 weeks, and prohibit the use of federal 
tax dollars for abortion. 
Despite all of this, we are already beginning 
to see the drastic consequences of the 2020 
presidential election for the pro-life community. 
President Joe Biden is wasting no time to ad-
vance his radical pro-abortion agenda. The 
Biden administration announced that they in-
tend to revoke the Mexico City Policy, which 
bans United States taxpayer funding to foreign 
organizations that provide abortions. President 
Biden and his Democrat counterparts will 
shamefully 
send 
Americans’ 
hard-earned 
money to other countries with the intention of 
funding abortions—this is deeply wrong and 
sends a horrible message about our values to 
the rest of the world. 
Unfortunately, it does not end there. Presi-
dent Biden also proudly campaigned on end-
ing the Hyde Amendment, a bipartisan, pro-life 
public policy that has been in place for more 
than four decades that restricts federal funding 
for abortions. If you didn’t know, President 
Biden had previously opposed taxpayer-fund-
ed abortion for nearly 50 years, until he de-
cided to run for president and abandon his 
conviction on the issue. I pray that President 
Biden will appeal to his better angels and re-
turn to a commonsense support of the Hyde 
Amendment, especially if he truly wants to 
unite our country. Forcing American taxpayers 
to subsidize unrestricted, unlimited abortions 
will only further our divisions and isolate our 
fellow Americans. 
We must reaffirm our commitment to de-
fending the most vulnerable lives among us— 
the unborn. Pro-life Americans, especially pro- 
life Kansans, will not rest until innocent human 
life is protected from the abortion industry. Life 
will win.

DIVIDED FAMILIES 
REUNIFICATION ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the reintroduction of my Divided 
Families Reunification Act, and to raise the 
voices of families who have been separated 
for decades both across the DMZ and across 
the Pacific Ocean. 
Over seventy years ago, millions of Koreans 
were plunged into a harrowing war that 
brought misery, death, and destruction to their 
lives. Since then, the war has been frozen by 
an armistice agreement—signed on July 27, 
1953—that persists to today. The division of 
the Korean Peninsula into South and North 
Korea separated millions of Koreans from their 
family members. Through the years, there 
have been some agreed upon reunions be-
tween South and North Koreans. For Korean 
Americans, however, there is no pathway for 
such reunions, as they have not been per-
mitted to participate in these inter-Korean fam-
ily reunions. Many of these Americans are in 
their 70s through 90s, and time is of the es-
sence to be reunited with their families. I have 
had the honor to meet some of these divided 
Korean American family members, and it 
breaks my heart that their chance of a reunion 
with their loved ones grows less likely each 
day. 
As a member of the State and Foreign Op-
erations Subcommittee on the House Appro-
priations Committee, I am proud to have se-
cured provisions in the Fiscal Year 2020 and 
2021 accompanying reports that support the 
reunification of Korean Americans and their 
families in North Korea. 
The unresolved status of the war continues 
to impact multiple generations of Korean 
Americans, particularly women, in myriad 
ways. All these years later, many survivors of 
the war are still haunted by their trauma. And 
younger generations who are responsible for 
their caregiving often internalize this unre-
solved grief. 
This is why I am proud to reintroduce the 
Divided Families Reunification Act with Con-
gressman VAN TAYLOR, which requires the 
Secretary of State or a designee to consult 
with officials in South Korea on potential op-
portunities to reunite Korean American families 
with family members in North Korea. This bill 
will also require the Special Envoy on North 
Korean Human Rights to submit a report on 
the opportunities for video reunions between 
Korean Americans and family members in 
North Korea. 
I encourage all my colleagues to cosponsor 
this bipartisan bill, which unanimously passed 
the House of Representatives during the 116th 
Congress.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF SHELDON ADELSON 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
include in the RECORD an article honoring 
Sheldon Adelson, who was a truly great Amer-
ican. The following article, by Matt Brooks the 
Executive Director of the Republican Jewish 
Coalition, published in Newsweek on January 
15, 2021, honors his incredible life and legacy. 
Horatio Alger wrote rags-to-riches stories 
in the 1800s about poor boys who became 
wealthy through pluck, luck and good deeds. 
Sheldon Adelson did him one better, actually 
living a rags-to-riches story rooted in hard 
work, vision, courage—and good deeds. With 
Sheldon’s passing, we have lost not only a 
remarkably successful business leader and an 
extraordinary philanthropist, but someone I 
was privileged to call a dear mentor and 
friend. 
It is well known that Sheldon came from 
humble beginnings, as the child of immi-
grants living in Boston’s Dorchester neigh-
borhood. More than 80 years later, he still

February 4, 2021 
viewed the world through the eyes of a poor 
kid from Dorchester. As one of the richest 
men in America, he could afford the finest 
wines and any luxury foods he desired. But 
those who knew him knew that the best time 
to meet with Sheldon was on Friday over 
lunch in his office, because that was his fa-
vorite day, when his staff would bring him 
hot dogs and sliders for lunch and he was 
sure to be in a good mood. He never lost his 
enjoyment for those kinds of simple things. 
More than that, Sheldon never lost touch 
with people. Most of those who achieve his 
level of success spend a lot of money on staff 
to serve as buffers between them and other 
people. Sheldon didn’t do that. At Repub-
lican Jewish Coalition events, people would 
be lined up 20- or 30-deep to say hello and 
take pictures with him. He obliged them, 
even in the middle of eating his dinner. He 
gave out his cell phone number freely and 
enjoyed being with people, talking to them 
and listening to them. 
Sheldon was a serial entrepreneur who cre-
ated dozens of companies over the years. He 
was often called a visionary leader, which is 
true, but he had more than just vision. Hard 
work and courageous confidence (or out-
rageous confidence, to your detractors) are 
required to achieve great things. Sheldon 
had a vision of Las Vegas as more than just 
a gambling town. He knew that bringing in 
trade shows and business conventions and of-
fering grand resorts with the finest amen-
ities and big, beautiful rooms would make 
Las Vegas a top destination for millions of 
people. When he began building The Vene-
tian, he was mocked and called a fool. But he 
never lost confidence in his vision of what 
Las Vegas could be, and today everyone is 
copying his integrated resort model. 
The same was true in Asia, where Sheldon 
saw glittering potential in Macau, then a 
seedy, prostitution-ridden city. He turned it 
into Asia’s own Las Vegas, on land reclaimed 
from the sea. People called him crazy, but 
once again he had the courage of his convic-
tions and he was proven right. His confidence 
in his own vision and his willingness to take 
risks to bring that vision to fruition were 
the keys to his success. 
That success made it possible for him and 
his beloved wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, to en-
gage in substantial and meaningful philan-
thropy—in the Jewish community and be-
yond. The Adelsons have been the largest 
funders of Taglit-Birthright Israel and sup-
ported Yad Vashem, United Hatzalah and 
Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, among 
other organizations in Israel. They built a 
$65 million campus in Las Vegas for the Mil-
ton 
I. 
Schwartz 
Hebrew 
Academy 
and 
Adelson School, which serves students from 
preschool through high school. In addition, 
their Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson 
Medical Research Foundation funds collabo-
rative, cutting-edge medical research. Dr. 
Miriam Adelson has contributed enormously 
to drug addiction research and therapy, and 
the Adelsons built two major drug abuse 
treatment and research centers, in Las 
Vegas and in Israel. 
The Adelsons have also extended tremen-
dous kindness to friends and others in need. 
Sheldon showed the same compassion to his 
employees that he showed to everyone else. 
When COVID–19 hit, he refused to lay off his 
employees, and he continued to provide them 
with full pay and benefits throughout the 
pandemic. 
Sheldon did what he thought was right, in 
business and in every other part of his life. If 
you wanted to argue with him, you had bet-
ter know your stuff. Sheldon never got a col-
lege degree, but he was one of the smartest 
people I’ve ever known. He hated yes-men 
and respected people who were not intimi-
dated by him or his wealth—people who 
would give him honest and sound counsel. 
I have a very vivid memory of the first 
time I met Sheldon. I traveled to Las Vegas 
to tell him about the Republican Jewish Coa-
lition (RJC) and try to get him involved in 
the organization. We had a wide-ranging con-
versation and, at one point, he asked me 
what I thought about something he’d said. I 
said I disagreed with him. You could have 
heard a pin drop in that room. Sheldon 
cocked his head and asked, ‘‘Why?’’ I an-
swered him honestly, sure that I had lost all 
chance of getting him interested in the RJC, 
but he replied, ‘‘Yeah, I think you might be 
right.’’ After that, Sheldon was very in-
volved in the RJC and gave generously not 
only his money, but more importantly, his 
time and good counsel. Much of the RJC’s in-
novation and impact over the last few years 
were made possible by his vision and leader-
ship. 
Sheldon was an American patriot, a dedi-
cated defender of Israel and a living example 
of the American dream. His passing truly 
leaves an empty place where a vibrant, cou-
rageous and caring man once stood. He will 
be sorely missed.

CONCURRENT 
RESOLUTION 
ON 
THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 3, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, 
and as the Member of Congress for a con-
gressional district that has experienced the 
worst of COVID–19 as a public health emer-
gency and economic catastrophe, I rise in 
strong support of H. Con. Res. 11, 447, which 
reorders budgetary priorities to provide $1.9 
trillion to allow Congress to take immediate 
and decisive action to crush the virus and vac-
cinate our people, build the economy back 
better, reopen schools, and provide needed 
support and assistance to state and local gov-
ernments that have been asked to do too 
much with too little for far too long. 
Mr. Speaker, by an overwhelming margin 
(79 percent), the public wants and is demand-
ing that we act to provide more economic re-
lief to address the damage caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Repub-
licans and Republican-leaning independents 
believe an additional relief package is nec-
essary, while more than nine in ten (92 per-
cent) Democrats and Democratic leaners say 
more coronavirus aid will be needed. 
Even the most conservative Republicans 
favor more relief by a 56 percent–44 percent 
margin. 
Nearly nine in ten of all adults (88 percent) 
in lower-income households say an additional 
package is necessary, while 81 percent of Re-
publicans in lower-income households (81 per-
cent) say additional aid is needed now. 
Let me make clear at the outset Mr. Speak-
er, that nothing in this resolution precludes the 
reaching of a bipartisan and bicameral agree-
ment to pass and fund the President’s Amer-
ica Rescue Plan, which in nearly all material 
respects mirrors the Heroes Act passed by the 
House Democratic majority on May 15, 2020, 
nearly nine months ago, only to languish on 
the Republican Senate Majority Leader’s desk 
while hundreds of thousands of our fellow 
Americans succumbed to the virus and mil-
lions of others lost their livelihoods and busi-
nesses, and everyone faced an uncertain fu-
ture. 
It would send a powerful signal to the Amer-
ican people if our colleagues across the aisle 
would join us in this effort because nothing 
would better show them that their elected rep-
resentatives can set partisanship aside and 
put America first. 
And that bipartisan achievement would por-
tend success for similar initiatives in the area 
of infrastructure, energy, national and home-
land security, and criminal justice and immi-
gration reform, all of which I am ready and 
willing to reach across the aisle to find com-
mon ground. 
So, if our Republican colleagues are ame-
nable to reaching an agreement on a legisla-
tive response that is commensurate to the 
challenge facing Americans, nothing in the 
legislation before us will preclude that from 
happening. 
But have no doubt, if they refuse to be part 
of the solution, the unified and bicameral 
Democratic congressional majority, in coordi-
nation with the new Democratic Administra-
tion, will take the lead and act boldly to ad-
dress and overcome the present crisis. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
just a few days ago, ‘‘At this point in time in 
this nation, we need to go big. We need to 
quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the 
cows and count the cows and just move. And 
move forward and move right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion 
is piled high with difficulty, and we must 
rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so 
we must think anew and act anew. We must 
disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took 
last December was a step in the right direction 
but only a long-delayed down payment; we 
cannot afford any more delays, especially 
since Republican stalling already caused a 
painful lapse in critical unemployment assist-
ance last year, and additional unemployment 
assistance is set to expire on March 14, 2021. 
That is why this resolution, which creates a 
failsafe alternative so that the American Res-
cue Plan can be debated, voted on, and 
passed, is absolutely crucial and the right 
thing to do and to do right now. 
The American Rescue Plan proposed by 
President Biden takes a multiprong approach 
to tackling the public health and economic cri-
ses stemming from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
No one is better prepared or more experi-
enced to lead the American rescue that Presi-
dent Biden, who as Vice-President oversaw 
the implementation of the Recovery Act, which 
saved millions of jobs and rescued our econ-
omy from the Great Recession the Obama Ad-
ministration and the nation inherited from a 
previous Republican administration. 
And let us not forget that President Obama 
also placed his confidence in his vice-presi-
dent to oversee the rescue of the automotive 
industry, which he did so well that the Amer-
ican car industry fully recovered its status as 
the world leader.

Mr. Speaker, to crush the virus and safely 
reopen schools, the American Rescue Plan 
will mount a national vaccination program that 
includes setting up community vaccination 
sites nationwide and makes the investments 
necessary to safely reopen schools. 
It will also take complementary measures to 
combat the virus, including scaling up testing 
and tracing, addressing shortages of personal 
protective equipment and other critical sup-
plies, investing in high-quality treatments, and 
addressing health care disparities. 
The American Rescue Plan delivers imme-
diate relief to working families bearing the 
brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per per-
son in direct cash assistance to households 
across America, bringing the total (including 
the $600 down payment enacted in Decem-
ber) to $2,000. 
Additionally, the plan will also provide direct 
housing and nutrition assistance to families 
struggling to get by, expand access to safe 
and reliable child care and affordable health 
care, extend and expand unemployment insur-
ance so American workers can pay their bills, 
and give families with children as well as 
childless workers a boost through enhanced 
tax credits. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan 
provides much needed support for commu-
nities struggling with the economic fallout, in-
cluding hard-hit small businesses, especially 
those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and 
ethnic backgrounds that have experienced 
systemic discrimination. 
Finally, the plan also provides crucial re-
sources to protect the jobs of first responders, 
frontline public health workers, teachers, tran-
sit workers, and other essential workers that 
all Americans depend on. 
Mr. Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic, as 
did the videos of the unjustified killings of 
George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, Ahmed Arbrey, 
and so many others, laid bare for the nation 
to see the stark racial and ethnic inequalities 
exacerbated by the virus. 
In my home state of Texas, as of the end 
of September 2020, there have been more 
than 760,000 cases of COVID–19 and 16,000 
deaths. 
According to the Texas Department of State 
Health Care Services, 70 percent of the con-
firmed fatalities were people of color. 
In Texas, COVID–19 mortality rates are 30 
percent higher for African Americans and 80 
percent higher for Hispanics overall. 
The differences become much larger when 
accounting for age; for example, in the 25 to 
44–year-old age group, African American mor-
tality rates are more than four times higher 
than White rates, and the Hispanic rates are 
more than seven times higher. 
One factor in Hispanic and African American 
populations being more likely to contract 
COVID–19 is employment in occupations as-
sociated with public contact and that cannot 
be done remotely. 
The sad fact is that most workers in these 
occupations are less able to be absent from 
their job or to have paid time off. 
In Texas, people of color are more than 40 
percent of cashiers, retail salespersons, child 
care workers, licensed practical nurses, more 
than 50 percent of bus drivers and transit 
workers, medical and nursing assistants, per-
sonal care aides, and home health aides, and 
more than 60 percent of building cleaners and 
housekeepers. 
In addition, Hispanic and African American 
populations in Texas are less likely to have 
health insurance and to have a regular health 
care provider, so less likely to seek or receive 
early care for symptoms, especially in the first 
months of the epidemic. 
And African American and Hispanic popu-
lations are also more likely to have an under-
lying health condition that makes them more 
vulnerable to the effects of COVID–19. 
To respond and mitigate the devastation 
wrought by COVID–19 on Americans, and es-
pecially marginal and vulnerable communities 
of color, I have introduced H.R. 330, the ‘‘De-
livering COVID–19 Vaccinations to All Regions 
and Vulnerable Communities Act’’ or ‘‘COVID– 
19 Delivery Act,’’ which I invite all Members to 
join as sponsors. 
Under the COVID–19 Delivery Act, FEMA 
will be authorized and directed to lead the ef-
fort for vaccine delivery from the receipt from 
manufacturing facilities to delivery to des-
ignated inoculation sites (hospital, clinic, doc-
tors’ offices, school, places of worship, com-
munity centers, parks, or neighborhood gath-
ering locations. 
The legislation directs FEMA to develop and 
deploy a fully staffed and resourced 24–7 ad-
vanced real-time tracking system that allows 
FEMA to monitor shipments of vaccine units 
that can provide end-to-end transparency on 
the temperature, real-time location, origin, and 
destination data, anticipated time of arrival, 
and report on changes and update recipients 
on the progress of their delivery and report on 
changes that may impact expected delivery or 
the viability of the vaccine while in transit. 
FEMA will provide an advanced communica-
tion system that allows public health depart-
ments to communicate their vaccine readi-
ness, capability of receiving vaccines, delivery 
locations, details of facility capability of storing, 
securing, personnel authorized to receive de-
liveries, logistics for delivering vaccines to pa-
tients, report on vaccine receipts, condition of 
vaccines, patient reactions, feedback on how 
to improve the process. 
H.R. 330 authorizes FEMA to secure trans-
portation for delivery or use of vaccines, and, 
when requested, security for the vaccine deliv-
ery sites or inoculation locations to ensure the 
life and safety of personnel and patients who 
seek to provide or receive vaccinations are 
free of interference or threat. 
Finally, the COVID–19 Delivery Act directs 
FEMA to conduct public education and patient 
engagement through the provision of inocula-
tions of persons in areas and locations where 
vulnerable populations are under performing in 
getting vaccinations. 
Mr. Speaker, the 2021 budget resolution be-
fore us now is not a comprehensive fiscal 
blueprint for the next 10 years; it is designed 
solely to provide the option of using reconcili-
ation to deliver critical relief and achieve the 
goals of the American Rescue Plan. 
As such, the total spending and revenue 
levels in the resolution simply reflect current- 
law projections adjusted for the estimated 
costs of the American Rescue Plan. 
Once the American Rescue Plan becomes 
law, Congress will begin its work on a forward- 
looking, comprehensive budget resolution for 
2022 that will provide urgently needed eco-
nomic support and address longstanding defi-
cits in our communities and underlying inequi-
ties in our society, which have been so starkly 
revealed and exacerbated by COVID–19. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage.

HALF
OF TEXAS FACE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP 
BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, SUR-
VEY FINDS 
(By Nataly Keomoungkhoun) 
According to the Episcopal Health Founda-
tion survey, Black and Hispanic people are 
much more likely to be concerned about an-
other wave of COVID–19. 
Half of Texans are experiencing some kind 
of financial hardship because of the ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic, a new survey finds. 
The survey, conducted by the Episcopal 
Health Foundation, highlights how the pan-
demic affects people across the state with 
different household incomes and races, with 
and without health insurance, and other fac-
tors. Nearly 1,900 Texans were surveyed. 
‘‘From being uninsured to not having 
internet access for online school, Texans say 
these nonmedical factors are not only shap-
ing how they’re dealing with the pandemic; 
they also could be seriously affecting their 
future health in many different ways,’’ said 
Elena Marks, CEO of the foundation. 
Roughly 22% of Texas residents are facing 
‘‘severe hardship,’’ the survey found, and an 
additional 28% are facing ‘‘moderate hard-
ship.’’ 
Those with less than $50,000 in household 
income were more likely to experience finan-
cial distress than those making more than 
$50,000, according to the survey. A third of 
the people surveyed said someone in their 
home had lost a job or business or had work 
hours reduced. 
Those deemed essential workers make up 
about 34% of Texans, the survey found. 
About 43% of essential workers are Hispanic, 
38% are white and 10% are Black. According 
to the survey, those who hold essential jobs 
are more likely to receive government as-
sistance such as food aid and Medicaid, and 
they are less likely to have health insurance. 
Medical 
care 
has 
been 
postponed 
or 
skipped altogether by 36% of people since the 
start of the pandemic, the survey found. 
Most said their mental health was good, but 
46% were worried about the effects of pan-
demic-related stress on their health. 
Texas continues to have the highest rate of 
people in the nation without health insur-
ance, with 29% saying they lack coverage. 
The survey asked whether Texans were 
bracing for a worsening of the COVID–19 out-
break. Overall, less than half said they were 
very concerned about another wave. But 
roughly 73% of Black Texans and 55% of His-
panic Texans said they were very concerned 
about another wave, compared with about 
33% of white Texans. 
A majority did not think the federal gov-
ernment was very prepared for another wave 
of COVID–19. 
‘‘These stark differences in concerns about 
the future show that COVID–19 is hitting 
Black and Hispanic Texans harder than any-
one else,’’ Marks said. ‘‘These groups are see-
ing more deaths and serious complications 
from the virus because they’re more likely 
to already suffer chronic conditions related 
to where they live that make them more sus-
ceptible.’’ 
Nearly 75% of surveyed Texans said they 
received financial assistance from the fed-
eral government in the form of unemploy-
ment benefits, small-business loans and di-
rect stimulus payments. One-fourth said 
they also received assistance from programs 
such as STAR Medicaid and the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program, or 
SNAP. Most Texans who receive these bene-
fits are Black or Hispanic, the survey found.

About 18% of people said they had received 
help from a nonprofit organization, and 13% 
said they had received food from a local food 
bank during the pandemic. 
‘‘This kind of information is crucial to let-
ting government and other recovery efforts 
know what Texans need to recover from the 
pandemic,’’ Marks said. ‘‘We hope it helps 
make good decisions about how to reach 
those most in need with the help they need 
the most.’’

‘‘WE CAN’T DO IT ALONE’’: TEXANS SAY FED-
ERAL LEADERS’ INACTION ON A NEW CORONA 
VIRUS AID PACKAGE IS ENDANGERING THEIR 
LIVELIHOODS 
(By Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff and Trinady Joslin) 
Texas business owners and unemployed 
residents feel like federal leaders of both 
parties are playing political games with 
their financial lives in the middle of a dam-
aging recession. 
Jacque Miles is three weeks away from los-
ing everything—her home, her utilities and 
even the cellphone service she relies on to 
apply for five to six jobs a day. 
The 54-year-old Myra resident was let go 
from her job at a merchandising agency in 
April and, like millions of Texans, has been 
watching Congress to see if it’ll pass another 
federal relief package to help her make ends 
meet during the pandemic and its parallel 
economic recession. 
But federal lawmakers and President Don-
ald Trump have failed for months during a 
heated election year to reach a deal on a bill 
that could provide millions of Texans with a 
second $1,200 stimulus check, additional un-
employment benefits and more loans for 
small business owners hanging on by a 
thread. 
‘‘They all get to go home to their nice big 
house and eat their nice big meal,’’ Miles 
said of the federal officials and lawmakers 
who have been working on a deal. ‘‘And I’m 
eating macaroni and cheese for the 10th time 
this week. How can that be happening?’’ 
It’s been a dizzying few days for Texans 
waiting to see if more assistance will come. 
Trump deflated hopes that an agreement 
would be reached soon when he tweeted 
Tuesday that he’d told his negotiators to 
halt discussions until after the Nov. 3 elec-
tion. Later that evening, he seemingly 
walked back that request, calling for stand- 
alone bills funding specific programs, which 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled 
she would not support. 
Then on Thursday, according to media re-
ports, 
Trump 
said 
talks 
had 
resumed. 
Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff said she and 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dis-
cussed the prospects of reaching an agree-
ment on a comprehensive bill. And on Fri-
day, it appeared that the talks for a large re-
lief package were back on. 
But it is still not known if or when any-
thing will pass, leaving struggling Texans to 
continue scraping by with no clear end in 
sight. 
Miles likened the ever-changing develop-
ments to an ‘‘exhausting’’ tennis match. 
‘‘I’m just so disappointed with the govern-
ment in general,’’ she said. ‘‘Not any par-
ticular party, just the government in gen-
eral. It’s just so sad.’’ 
As families struggle to keep their water 
running and business owners pull in heavy 
losses, Texans are ‘‘heartbroken’’ and angry 
with the federal government’s lack of sup-
port. 
Workers and business owners said they feel 
like those in charge are playing games with 
their livelihoods and are out of touch with 
the people they represent at the same time 
that many of them are seeking their votes. 
The prospects of a deal after the expiration 
of the CARES Act at the end of July has 
been a political football for months. Demo-
crats have proposed a $2.2 trillion dollar 
package, which would bring back an addi-
tional $600 in weekly unemployment pay-
ments, according to media reports. The 
White House has countered with a $1.6 tril-
lion dollar plan with $400 in extra weekly un-
employment, though it’s unclear congres-
sional Republicans would pass such a bill. 
Both sides appear to agree on sending out 
another round of $1,200 stimulus checks, 
which were first sent to people making 
$75,000 or less this spring. 
Further delay of any federal deal could 
also shutter more businesses, lead to evic-
tions and cause permanent job losses for mil-
lions, according to various industry leaders. 
With reduced indoor capacity, economic 
hardships hitting their customers and colder 
weather soon threatening outdoor dining, no 
additional stimulus deal could be cata-
strophic for restaurants. 
According to Texas Restaurant Associa-
tion President and CEO Emily Williams 
Knight, 15% of Texas’ 50,000 restaurants have 
already closed their doors permanently. With 
no stimulus plan, another 10% could close 
before the year ends, she said. 
She’s received countless calls from res-
taurant owners in tears because, after pour-
ing years into their dream business, they had 
to shut down everything. 
‘‘It felt like a gut punch that the potential 
relief is officially done,’’ said Knight. ‘‘Eight 
weeks of help for a seven month problem 
seems incredibly unreasonable.’’ 
‘‘NO TIME TO BE PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES’’ 
J.R. Gonzales, a top executive at the Texas 
Association of Mexican American Chambers 
of Commerce, said the lack of federal sup-
port has hit Hispanic Texans—who have dis-
proportionately contracted and died from 
the virus—particularly hard. 
‘‘The back and forth to me is just political 
jockeying and a waste of time,’’ he said, add-
ing that he holds elected officials of both 
parties responsible for this failure, a senti-
ment held by most Texans who spoke to The 
Texas Tribune about a potential new relief 
package. 
Gonzales said the Hispanic community he 
represents has a large number of small busi-
ness owners, some of whom are struggling to 
stay open. Many of their customers are out 
of work or risk their lives to fill essential 
jobs. 
‘‘This is no time to be playing political 
games,’’ Gonzales said. ‘‘Hispanic business 
owners and workers need these grants to put 
food on the table.’’ 
One such business is Beijing Bistro, which 
Janette Martinez, 25, took over from her fa-
ther, Eddie, when he had a stroke in April. 
With $250,000 in medical bills—Eddie does not 
have insurance—on top of the challenges of 
running the restaurant in Buda, Martinez 
feels like she’s drinking water from a fire 
hose. 
She’s never run a business before and 
paused her plans to return to college and 
study business management to schedule 
shifts for cooks, manage the books and keep 
the family business afloat. The $80,000 she re-
ceived from the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram loans, which are now dwindling, al-
lowed her to pay all her staff. 
Still, Martinez has no idea if she’s break-
ing even or losing money and works every 
hour the restaurant is open six days a week. 
On her birthday next week, her biggest wish 
for a celebration is just to get a day off. And 
see her dad. 
‘‘We’re all just trying to survive as best we 
can out here,’’ she said. ‘‘The longer they 
take choosing whether or not to pass the 
stimulus, the more dire the situation will be-
come.’’ 
She, too, holds both parties responsible for 
failing to pass a plan. 
Washington’s 
inaction 
has 
made 
res-
taurant owners feel like they don’t matter, 
Knight said. 
‘‘It was a lot of theatrics so they could go 
back to their constituents and demonstrate 
that they acted and it was someone else’s 
fault,’’ she said. 
ECONOMIC ISSUES SPAN INDUSTRIES 
Many of the issues restaurants face extend 
to industries across the state. 
Ebele Iloanye, the owner of the retail store 
MODChic Couture in Sugar Land, has lost 
70% in revenue over the last few months of 
the pandemic. Though she’s kept up with her 
rent for now, largely with the help of her 
$11,000 PPP loan, she’s cut many of her em-
ployees. 
A second stimulus package would ensure 
she could continue to pay her rent—and 
bring back the workers she’s been unable to 
pay for months. That would mean they could 
then pay their bills as well. 
‘‘Things are bad all around, everybody can 
see it and we’re just trying to survive,’’ 
Iloanye said. ‘‘We’re doing our part, and I 
really hope that they would now do theirs.’’ 
Iloanye did not cast blame on Trump spe-
cifically—though his tweets were the most 
recent example of what many consider polit-
ical posturing—but said that all Washington 
politicians are to blame for this failure to do 
the job they were elected to do. Eddie 
Aldrete, the national affairs committee 
chair of the Texas Association of Business, 
agreed. 
‘‘Texas businesses are doing their best to 
weather this pandemic and help our state 
and nation recover,’’ he said. ‘‘We can’t do it 
alone, and we are hopeful that leaders in 
Washington can finally, for once, find com-
mon ground to provide a stimulus and relief 
package.’’ 
Miles said she just wants a reprieve. While 
she voted for Trump in 2016, she feels like 
neither party is willing to bend and offer 
people help. After more than seven months 
of seeing disaster everywhere she looks, she’s 
struggling to stay optimistic. 
Earlier this week, she said if the presi-
dential vote was tomorrow, she would choose 
Biden. But on Thursday, after even more diz-
zying developments, she said if the election 
was tomorrow, she’d just stay home. 
‘‘It’s hard to find a happy spot,’’ she said. 
‘‘It gets harder every day.’’

10 MONTHS INTO PANDEMIC, TEXAS’ UNEM-
PLOYMENT RATE STAYS NEAR GREAT RECES-
SION-LEVEL HIGHS 
(By Anna Novak and Mitchell Ferman) 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
Texas’ unemployment rate was 7.2% in De-
cember, up from 3.5% in December 2019. 
SALES TAX REVENUES 
In January, Texas collected $3.1 billion in 
sales tax revenues, down 0.3% from January 
2020. 
Business shutdowns and limits on their op-
erations through the coronavirus pandemic 
have battered Texas companies, which are 
now grappling with another devastating 
surge in infections as intensive care units at 
dozens of hospitals across the state are full. 
Entire industries—bars and restaurants, 
tourism and travel, oil and gas—continue to 
struggle. 
The unemployment rate in Texas decreased 
to 7.2% in December, more than double the 
rate of 3.5% a year earlier. Hungry and 
homeless Texans have been confused about 
the prospect of more federal coronavirus re-
lief while the state’s outdated and under-
staffed unemployment insurance office has

left countless Texans struggling to receive 
unemployment benefits as they navigate the 
Texas Workforce Commission’s confusing 
processes. 
A decline in Texas’ sales tax revenues—the 
largest source of funding for the state budg-
et—has created a shortfall that lawmakers 
will have to fill in the 2021 legislative ses-
sion. Economists say weakened global de-
mand for oil, high unemployment and the 
ongoing public health crisis will continue to 
weigh down Texas’ economic recovery. 
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECREASED IN 
DECEMBER 
Texas’ unemployment rate in December 
was 7.2%—a decrease from the 8.1% Novem-
ber jobless rate, according to a Texas Work-
force Commission report released Jan. 22. 
The state’s unemployment rate for December 
is the latest indicator that the economic re-
covery in Texas will be slow and staggered.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND LEGACY OF WILLIAM ‘‘RED’’ 
LEWIS 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a remarkable man: 
William ‘‘Red’’ Lewis. A Green Bay native and 
successful businessman, Red Lewis personi-
fied the entrepreneurial spirit generosity North-
east Wisconsin is known for. 
Born in 1942, Red was the youngest of four 
children. He attended Premontre High School 
(later to become Notre Dame de la Baie Acad-
emy) and graduated in 1960. After multiple 
jobs in the Green Bay area, Red began his 
career at the local PDQ car wash, working his 
way up to manager in 1967. Seeing an ave-
nue to improve PDQ’s cleanliness and effi-
ciency, Red bought the business in 1974. 
To enhance PDQ’s customer experience, 
Red founded PDQ Manufacturing. His leader-
ship drove PDQ into becoming the world’s 
largest touchless car wash manufacturer with 
clients in over 30 countries. In recognition of 
his innovation and contribution to the industry, 
Red was inducted into the Car Wash Hall of 
Fame in 2000 by the International Carwash 
Association. 
Beyond his business success, Red was 
well-known in the community for his kind heart 
and extensive philanthropy. He was deeply 
dedicated to giving back to a community that 
has supported him. He was particularly fond of 
supporting the Green Bay Boys & Girls Club, 
the Lac Baie Girl Scout Council, Catholic 
Charities, Manna for Life Ministries, NEW Zoo 
and St. Willebroad Parish. He was also gen-
erous to his alma mater, Notre Dame de la 
Baie Academy, and local veterans organiza-
tions. 
Red also had a passion for collecting cars, 
and in 2016 gifted the Green Bay community 
with The Automobile Gallery. This nonprofit is 
a beautiful addition to Green Bay’s downtown 
whose collection of more than 120 auto-
mobiles spans 113 years. It boasts a 1912 
Maxwell, 1963 Corvette, and 1982 DeLorean 
DMC–12, among many other restored models. 
Visitors from across the state come to Green 
Bay to enjoy the gallery which has quickly be-
come a cherished community treasure. 
Madam Speaker, words cannot adequately 
thank Red for his extraordinary commitment to 
the Green Bay community. His passing will be 
mourned by many across Northeast Wis-
consin. My prayers and condolences go out to 
his family and to all the lives he touched.

RECOGNIZING CAREN COWAN 
HON. YVETTE HERRELL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize a New Mexican who has 
been a tireless advocate for our farmers, 
ranchers, and the families who work every day 
to provide for America. Caren Cowan is not 
only a friend of mine, but of the hardworking 
New Mexicans who she stands up for every 
day. As the 2020 Cattleman of the Year and 
for a lifetime of service, Ms. Cowan deserves 
our appreciation. 
After graduating from Arizona University in 
1975 with a degree in Agriculture Communica-
tions, Caren worked for the Arizona National 
Livestock Show, the American Red Brangus 
Association in Texas, and the New Mexico 
Wool Growers. She has served as the Execu-
tive Director for the New Mexico Cattle Grow-
ers since 1997 where she fights to protect the 
rights of livestock producers and ensure their 
voices are always heard on every issue. She 
has taken on battles in the courtroom, tackled 
the often burdensome statutory and regulatory 
requirements head on, and successfully navi-
gated the bureaucracies’ often confusing rules 
and regulations, something not easily done. 
For 23 years Caren has been at the forefront 
of these issues and has worked tirelessly on 
behalf of the organization’s members. 
As a leader on the issues facing the farmers 
and ranchers of New Mexico, Ms. Cowan is 
training the next generation of advocates to 
ensure the New Mexico’s agricultural families 
always have a voice. We are forever grateful 
for her work and dedication to the state we 
love.

MR. AND MRS. ORESTUS AND 
GERALDINE FLOWERS 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. and Mrs. Orestus and Geraldine 
Flowers of Burkesville for recently celebrating 
their 75th anniversary. 
Mr. and Mrs. Flowers have displayed com-
mitment in all facets of their life. At twenty-two 
years of age, Mr. Flowers left his then- 
girlfriend, Geraldine, to serve in the Army for 
three-and-a-half-years during World War II. 
Mr. Flowers kept a picture of Geraldine in his 
wallet during the war, and upon returning, 
married Geraldine on February 1, 1946. Mr. 
and Mrs. Flowers displayed an exemplary 
level of commitment to both each other and 
our nation through his military service. 
Mr. and Mrs. Flowers raised their family in 
Cumberland County, Kentucky. They and their 
three daughters, four grandchildren, and 
seven great-grandchildren have been a staple 
in the community of Burkesville. Mr. Flowers 
has served in numerous capacities in the local 
community. In 1952, he brought Houchens 
Market to Burkesville, where he served as 
manager for 32 years. After retiring from 
Houchens, he has continued work at Norris 
and New Funeral Home, where he is still 
showing off the picture of his wife that he took 
to war with him seventy-eight years ago. 
Once again, I would like to join everyone in 
Burkesville and throughout the 1st District of 
Kentucky in congratulating Mr. and Mrs. Flow-
ers on this extraordinary milestone.

HONORING VETERANS DURING 
NATIONAL SALUTE WEEK 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to veterans cared for by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs in northeast Indi-
ana and across the United States. 
Each year, the week of February 14 is an 
opportunity for Americans to express their col-
lective gratitude for the more than 9 million 
veterans of the United States Armed Services 
who are cared for in the VA system. This 
year’s National Salute Week is the most im-
portant one to date, given the difficult times 
our nation has faced over the last 12 months 
with many of America’s veterans hardest hit. 
This week also serves as an opportunity for 
Hoosiers and Americans everywhere to learn 
about the role of the VA medical system, to 
encourage citizens to visit hospitalized Vet-
erans and to become involved as volunteers 
Nationwide, over 61,000 volunteers provide 
more than 9.2 million volunteer hours serving 
America’s veterans. Volunteers are a priceless 
asset to our veterans, to the VA and to the 
country. 
As a veteran myself and member of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee in Con-
gress, I am honored to have served in uniform 
and to serve the people of northeast Indiana 
in Congress. One of my top priorities has 
been, and always will be, ensuring those who 
served the United States receive the honor, 
care, and opportunity they deserve. 
This is a testament to the honor and sac-
rifice of those heroes who have served our 
country, and to those who serve them.

and educator in Roanoke County who encour-
aged students and athletes toward excellence. 
Joe was born in Schenectady, New York on 
October 28, 1953. He grew up in Roanoke, 
graduated from Andrew Lewis High School in 
1972, and graduated from Roanoke College in 
1976. As a young man, he attained the rank 
of Eagle Scout and was a standout track and 
field and cross country athlete, eventually

earning induction into the Roanoke College 
Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998. To the benefit 
of many young people in the Roanoke Valley, 
these activities would remain important to him 
for the rest of his life. 
After coaching at Bassett High School from 
1978 to 1980, he arrived at Cave Spring High 
School to teach American history and govern-
ment and coach boys and girls outdoor track 
and field, indoor track, and cross country. He 
loved the topic of American history as well as 
local stories of the past, portraying western 
Virginia founding father Andrew Lewis on a 
number of occasions. 
As a student, Joe set several school cross 
country or track and field records, and as a 
coach for a combined 31 seasons, he stood 
out as well. In 1980, he helped David Garlow 
win the Virginia High School League (VHSL) 
Group AAA boys cross country individual 
championship. He also coached future Na-
tional Football League players Ronde and Tiki 
Barber. His record at Cave Spring earned him 
six coach of the year honors. 
Joe retired from teaching in 2013, but he 
continued as a USA Track & Field and VHSL 
official and participated in the Star City Strid-
ers, a local running group. He was also on the 
Eagle Scout Board of Review. I shared sev-
eral interests with Joe and join with many in 
the Roanoke Valley who will miss this out-
standing educator and coach and good man. 
He is survived by his wife Terry; daughters 
and sons-in-law Jackie and John Downs and 
Cathy LaRocco and Jeff Black; granddaughter 
Brigid Downs; and brothers Jim LaRocco and 
wife Sharon and John LaRocco. I offer them 
my condolences on their loss.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF BILL 
MARDIS 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of my 
beloved friend, Bill Mardis, who was the long- 
time editor of the Commonwealth Journal in 
Somerset, Kentucky. 
Though small in stature, Bill Mardis was a 
journalism giant in Somerset, wielding a 
mighty pen, a humble approach and a steel- 
trap mind. We first became friends in the 
1970s, with shared roots in radio broadcasting 
and a zeal for history and politics. Our friend-
ship never swayed Bill from asking tough 
questions and writing an occasional hard-hit-
ting piece; still yet we maintained a mutual re-
spect for one another at all times. He was a 
dearly loved, iconic member of the Lake Cum-
berland region and his life’s work kept all of us 
more informed. If a story had heart and soul, 
it was undoubtedly penned by Mardis. His sig-
nature ‘‘Humble Reporter’’ satire series also 
provided much-needed comic relief to the seri-
ous nature of the daily news covering the rest 
of the pages. In person, Bill also brought a 
unique and jovial interview style to every situa-
tion, while remaining fair, straight-forward and 
balanced through-out his career spanning 
nearly six decades. 
Bill was known for his stellar work ethic, 
often putting in 12-hour work days to publish 
an accurate, reputable newspaper. In recent 
years, our interviews would occasionally linger 
an hour or more as we drifted off topic and 
reminisced about our mutual friends and men-
tors who were instrumental to the growth and 
progress in southern Kentucky, from the late 
U.S. Sen. John Sherman Cooper to the late 
Pulaski Circuit Judge Roscoe Tartar, and oth-
ers. He kept a tight grip on the political pulse 
of the Lake Cumberland region, cultivating a 
trusted network of friends across party lines, 
lending to his rich, in-depth reporting. 
May his legacy of balanced and fair jour-
nalism live on at the Commonwealth Journal 
where he dedicated nearly 60 years with the 
utmost integrity. My wife Cynthia and I send 
our heartfelt condolences to Bill’s family, his 
coworkers at the newspaper, and his expan-
sive community of friends. In the words of our 
satirical Humble Reporter, ‘‘I ain’t never seed 
nothin’ lak hit’’ and I don’t suspect we ever will 
again.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
PEORIA 
POLICE 
CHIEF 
LOREN 
MARION III 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor and congratulate Police Chief Loren 
Marion III on his retirement from the Peoria 
Police Department after 26 years. 
Loren Marion was hired as a Police Officer 
by the City of Peoria on October 3, 1994. Dur-
ing his career, he worked in Patrol, on the 
Community Area Target Team, the Street 
Crimes Unit, the Vice and Narcotics Unit, and 
the Target Offender Unit. Chief Marion also 
held the collateral duty of Task Force Officer 
with the Drug Enforcement Administration. On 
November 14, 2018, he was selected as Po-
lice Chief of the Peoria Police Department. 
Before working for the City, Chief Marion also 
served on active duty with the Army Military 
Police. 
During his time with the Peoria Police De-
partment, Chief Marion has been recognized 
with numerous awards and accolades for his 
service and exemplary professional perform-
ance. In 2008, Loren was named ‘‘Officer of 
the Year’’ and awarded the American Legion 
Meritorious Service Award. Chief Marion was 
known for his dedication to his fellow officers 
and he established an Officer Wellness pro-
gram that provides peer to peer support as 
well as a Police Chaplain that assists officers 
who have been exposed to trauma. 
In May of 2019, under Chief Marion’s lead-
ership, the Peoria Police Department became 
fully accredited by the Commission on Accred-
itation for Law Enforcement Agencies due to 
the improvement of community and police re-
lations, policies and procedures, management, 
operations, and support services. 
Chief Marion has always been committed to 
his work and his community. It is my privilege 
to congratulate Chief Marion on his service to 
the Peoria Police Department. We have all 
been blessed to have Chief Marion serving 
and protecting us. The City of Peoria is a bet-
ter place because of his service.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD 
S. PEPPER 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 4, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor and remember the life of Richard 
Pepper, who passed away peacefully on Janu-
ary 28, 2021, at the age of 90. 
Born in Barrington, Illinois in 1930, Richard, 
at an early age, displayed natural gravitation 
towards construction and philanthropy. Rich-
ard began his career working as an estimator 
for Pepper Construction in 1957. Soon after 
marrying his beloved wife, Roxy, Richard as-
sumed leadership of the company after the 
sudden passing of his father, Stanley Pepper. 
Despite his young age, Richard showed the 
maturity and inclination to grow and foster the 
company and the ideals that his father had im-
plemented. Under Richard’s leadership, Pep-
per Construction strived to ensure their build-
ing decisions impacted the future to create a 
better quality of life for all. 
Richard grew Pepper Construction into the 
nationally recognized construction firm known 
by so many across the Midwest. Richard held 
several leadership positions in the construction 
industry, including serving as president of the 
Associated General Contractors of America in 
1983. He received the Jack Kinnaman Leader-
ship Award from the American Institute of 
Constructors in 2015, which honors corpora-
tion leaders who have taken a visible leader-
ship role in the American Institute of Construc-
tors. 
Richard’s leadership at Pepper Construction 
has fostered a corporate culture that promotes 
community and industry involvement. During 
his time, Richard was well-known for his out-
spoken support of community improvement, 
advocating for bold initiatives, and striving to 
transform tomorrow. 
We mourn the passing of Richard, a friend, 
and mentor to many. He left a lasting impact 
on those who had the pleasure of knowing 
him. May his memory be eternal.
