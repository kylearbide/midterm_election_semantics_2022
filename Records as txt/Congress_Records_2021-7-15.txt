RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
AMERICAN JOBS AND FAMILIES PLAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
every Senator, from every State, has 
witnessed the hollowing out of the mid-
dle class over the past few decades. 
Globalization 
and 
technology 
have 
changed the way that Americans work 
and compete. Productivity increased, 
but wages for the bottom 70 percent 
stagnated in this century, in this 20 
years. 
Income 
equality 
spiked 
as 
wealth agglomerated to the top. 
The financial crisis and the COVID 
pandemic heaped additional hardship 
on middle-class families that were al-
ready falling behind. The changes in 
the world—the swirling changes, eco-
nomic and social—have made it harder 
to stay in the middle class and have 
made it harder to get to the middle 
class. 
We Democrats feel an obligation to 
make it easier for those in the middle 
class to enjoy that middle-class life 
and stay there and for those struggling 
to get into the middle class to have 
those ladders so they can climb up to 
get there. 
These are exciting and fundamental 
times to be here in the Senate. In 
short, we have a lot to do to restore the 
fundamental American promise of op-
portunity and economic mobility—the 
faith that, through hard work, any 
American can build a better life for 
themselves, their families, their chil-
dren, and then pass even greater oppor-
tunity on to their children. That is the 
American dream. It has been fading, 
and that has allowed demagoguery and 
nastiness and divisiveness to become 
too great a part of our politics. 
We want to restore that sunny opti-
mism that Americans have always had, 
and that is why we are so intent on 
moving forward this month. The idea 
that Americans can build a better life 
for themselves and pass greater oppor-
tunity to their children is at the heart

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4912 
July 15, 2021 
of what Democrats are trying to 
achieve this year through the Amer-
ican Jobs and Families Plan, helping 
middle-class families stay in the mid-
dle class and breathe easier and helping 
poorer Americans climb that ladder to 
get there. 
And nothing—nothing—will do more 
to advance that goal than the bill we 
are working on this year. The budget 
resolution agreed to by Democrats on 
the Budget Committee this week is the 
first step down a long road toward en-
acting a transformational change in 
our economy. It will allow us to pass 
the most significant legislation to ex-
pand support for American families 
since the era of the New Deal and the 
Great 
Society. 
If 
not 
quite 
Rooseveltian in scope, it is certainly 
near 
Rooseveltian. 
It 
is 
dramatic 
change to help average families do bet-
ter. 
The best way to understand the 
emerging legislation is in three broad 
categories: 
jobs, 
which 
will 
come 
through major infrastructure invest-
ments; families; and climate. We are 
going to create thousands upon thou-
sands of good-paying jobs by investing 
in infrastructure and the training and 
apprenticeships that will help more 
Americans, including many of those 
who have been left out, get those jobs. 
We are going to expand and strength-
en the programs that support Amer-
ican families and introduce new ones, 
like paid family leave and a robust ex-
pansion of Medicaid to cover vision, 
dental, and hearing. I salute Senator 
SANDERS for putting it on the map and 
now making it a real possibility to 
happen. 
And we are going to act on climate in 
a bold and comprehensive way, to re-
duce emissions, make our infrastruc-
ture more resilient, and create the 
green jobs of the future to meet the 
President’s goals of an 80-percent re-
duction in dirty carbon that goes into 
energy production and a 50-percent 
overall reduction in the carbon we send 
to the atmosphere. 
When Republicans held the majority 
in the Senate, unfortunately, their sig-
nature legislative achievement was a 
massive tax break for corporations and 
the wealthy. From one report I read, 
the top 1 percent got 83 percent of the 
benefits when the Republicans had 
power. What a difference when Demo-
crats are in power. You know what the 
top 1 percent got in the ARP bill? Zero. 
Nada. Nothing. 
God bless them. They are doing 
great. They don’t need it. 
Democrats, instead, are strength-
ening the backbone of the middle class, 
and that is what we are going to do in 
this jobs and family plan. American 
workers, American families are going 
to benefit while we address the genera-
tional challenge of climate change. 
And as I have said from the start, 
Madam President—as I have said from 
the start—the two tracks of infrastruc-
ture are going to move in tandem. We 
are making good progress on both 
tracks. 
We in the Democratic caucus heard 
from the President yesterday on the 
budget resolution. The meeting was 
wonderful. The excitement was pal-
pable. The opportunity to do so much 
good for so many American families 
was in the air in that meeting. It was 
exciting. And, as that happened, the bi-
partisan working groups had many 
meetings on the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture framework as well. 
Today, I am announcing that I intend 
to file cloture on the vehicle for a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill on Monday 
of next week. Senators will have until 
Wednesday of next week before the ini-
tial vote on cloture on the motion to 
proceed. 
Everyone has been having productive 
conversations, and it is important to 
keep the two-track process moving. All 
parties involved in the bipartisan infra-
structure bill talks must now finalize 
their agreement so that the Senate can 
begin considering that legislation next 
week. 
And I am setting the same deadline, 
next Wednesday, for the entire Senate 
Democratic caucus to agree to move 
forward on the budget resolution with 
reconciliation instructions. The time 
has come to make progress, and we 
will. We must. 
CANNABIS ADMINISTRATION AND OPPORTUNITY 
ACT 
Madam President, now on another 
issue, marijuana, 20 years ago, roughly 
a third of the population supported the 
decriminalization of marijuana. Today 
that number is almost 70 percent. Even 
deep-rooted South Dakota voted to le-
galize the adult use of marijuana. 
Americans’ perception of marijuana 
has, justifiably, changed, and it is time 
that Congress caught up and reformed 
our laws to reflect the popular wisdom 
and the science. So, yesterday, I joined 
with Senator BOOKER, who has been 
such a leader on this issue for so long, 
and Chairman WYDEN, who has been ac-
tive on this issue as well, our Finance 
chairman, to introduce the Cannabis 
Administration and Opportunity Act, 
which represents a monumental change 
because, at long last, it would take 
steps to right the wrongs of the failed 
War on Drugs. It would remove mari-
juana from the Federal list of con-
trolled substances and expunge the 
criminal records of those with low- 
level marijuana offenses. 
Many States are rapidly moving to-
ward legalization, including my home 
State of New York. The legislature did 
that in this past session. These States 
show the potential for new industries 
that can give opportunities to long-for-
gotten entrepreneurs. Our law would 
establish fair administration so small 
businesses and communities of color 
can get their fair shake in the mari-
juana business. 
And 
we 
would 
deal 
with 
expungement—the tragedy of a young 
person being arrested because they had 
a small amount of marijuana in their 
pocket but, because of the historic 
overcriminalization, they have a per-
manent, serious criminal record that 
prevents them, inhibits them from 
moving forward in their lives. 
Now, I am the first majority leader 
to say it is time to end the Federal pro-
hibition on marijuana, and as majority 
leader I am going to push this issue 
forward and make it a priority for the 
Senate. 
In short, the Cannabis Administra-
tion and Opportunity Act would help 
the Federal Government catch up with 
what much of the country already un-
derstands, that we need to rethink our 
approach to marijuana and end—end— 
decades of overcriminalization. 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Madam President, on a final matter, 
the CTC, I have a little chart here. 
Over the past 20 years, the cost of rais-
ing children in America has become lu-
dicrously expensive. Everything—from 
diapers to housing, to healthcare, to 
college tuition—has risen in price, 
some of it rather steeply and dramati-
cally. 
Wages, unfortunately, have not kept 
pace, 
putting 
strain—ever 
more 
strain—on American parents. The cost 
of childcare alone can be roughly 
equivalent to buying a new car every 
single year. That is a big burden for so 
many families. 
The pandemic, of course, made life 
even harder on America’s families. So, 
in the American Rescue Plan, Demo-
crats made sure that it included a dra-
matic expansion of the Federal child 
tax credit, to give families a little 
extra help during the once-in-a-century 
crisis. 
And today—today—I am very proud 
to announce that tens of millions of 
Americans are going to see extra 
money land in their bank accounts, the 
first of monthly checks that will be 
disbursed through the expanded child 
tax credit. Let me say that again. Be-
cause of this law passed by Senate 
Democrats—sadly, unfortunately, not a 
single Republican voted for this much 
needed measure that will help the mid-
dle class and the poor—a vast majority 
of Americans, because of what we did, 
what we Senate Democrats did, will 
begin receiving a monthly check of $300 
for each child under 6 years old, and 
they will also receive $250 every month 
for each child between 6 and 17. 
Combined with the credits that apply 
next tax season, these payments total 
up to $3,600 for every child under 6 and 
$3,000 for every child 6 to 17. In short, 
it will amount to a substantial and po-
tentially 
life-altering 
tax 
cut—tax 
cut—for American families. 
If you are a middle-class mom or dad, 
this money will help defer the cost of 
groceries, rent, childcare, and maybe 
diapers, if you have an infant. Boy, 
they are expensive. I remember when 
my kids were little, compared to today, 
the cost. You can spend that money on 
something else if you need it, and it is 
going to go a long way to reducing the 
burdens that families face. 
It also helps those kids in poverty. 
The expanded child tax credit will cut

childhood poverty nearly in half. Four 
million American children, they ex-
pect, will be lifted. And when you are a 
child born into poverty, through no 
fault of your own, you may not have 
proper nutrition and food. You may not 
have proper education or healthcare or 
housing. And, by the time you are 14 or 
15, you are in a big ditch. Now, many, 
to their credit, climb out on their own, 
but this will prevent so many from 
going forward into that ditch. 
So it helps the poor, and it helps the 
middle class. We are proud of that. 
To all of America’s moms and dads, 
check your bank accounts this week. 
Check your bank account. You may 
not even know this is happening. If you 
filed taxes in either of the past 2 years, 
or in both of them, and you qualify for 
the credit, you will see this money 
automatically. If you didn’t file taxes 
in either of the past 2 years, you can go 
online—irs.gov/childtaxcredit—and 
sign up today. Let me repeat that, 
folks, for you listening. Go to irs.gov/ 
childtaxcredit and sign up. It is very 
simple and easy to sign up, and as long 
as your kids have a Social Security 
number, they can get it. 
Republicans have for a very long 
time claimed to be the party of tax 
cuts, but when you read the fine print, 
it turns out that the Republican Party 
is the party of tax cuts for the wealthy 
and the well-connected. 
Democrats are sending this check to 
American parents for the child tax 
credit, $300 per month, courtesy of 
President Biden and Senate and con-
gressional Democrats. Again, unfortu-
nately, every Republican voted no. 
And I want to give a lot of credit to 
Senator BENNET of Colorado and Sen-
ator BROWN of Ohio and Senator BOOK-
ER of New Jersey and Senator WYDEN 
of Oregon and so many others who 
fought for this issue and helped make 
it a reality that today is going to hap-
pen. 
So we say to the parents of America: 
Starting today, help—real help, signifi-
cant help—is on the way, not just for 
the wealthy, as the Republicans like to 
give it, but for the poor and the middle 
class. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
CUBA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
throughout my career, I have been 
proud to amplify the voices of freedom 
fighters around the world, brave men 
and women working to secure the 
blessings of liberty that we enjoy here 
in America. And I have repeatedly 
shone a floodlight on the oppressive re-
gimes that stand in their way. I have 
championed the pro-democracy move-
ment in Burma, the brave advocates 
for freedom in Hong Kong. 
Right now, the loudest cries for lib-
erty are coming from pretty close to 
home. After enduring 60-plus years of 
socialist tyranny just 90 miles from 
American soil, the people of Cuba are 
telling 
the 
world 
they 
have 
had 
enough—had enough. They have had 
enough of a regime that has stolen 
their dreams for decades. They have 
had enough of its stranglehold on infor-
mation and on prosperity. They have 
had enough of its intimidation and its 
repression. 
The past week’s demonstration in the 
streets of Havana should represent a 
major turning point in the Cuban peo-
ple’s movement toward liberation. The 
regime’s failed communist ideology has 
saddled generations of Cubans with a 
backward economy, inadequate serv-
ices, and no means of justice or dissent. 
Now, some naive Americans on the 
left seem intent on once again running 
interference for the Cuban regime. 
They still buy the propaganda that 
Cuba is a socialist paradise—paradise— 
with a model healthcare and education 
system that we should actually emu-
late. But the Cuban people see a dif-
ferent reality: an open-air prison that 
communism has run right into the 
ground. 
Since the 1950s, the blight of Castro 
rule has driven many Cubans to flee to 
the United States. Generations of im-
migrants and their descendants have 
lived out and are living out American 
dreams of prosperity, achievement, and 
service. We are blessed to call them fel-
low Americans. 
As Senator RUBIO put it so well this 
week, ‘‘The only country on this planet 
where Cubans are not successful is 
Cuba.’’ 
My hometown of Louisville is actu-
ally home to one of the largest Cuban- 
American populations in any American 
city outside of Florida. In recent days, 
this vibrant community has rallied by 
the hundreds in support of Cuban pro-
testers. As one of these fellow Ken-
tuckians of mine put it, ‘‘The only 
voice they have is us.’’ 
The brave men and women who have 
taken to the streets in Cuba are de-
manding freedoms they have been de-
nied their entire lives. They deserve 
our strong support. I am proud to co-
sponsor a new resolution with Senator 
RUBIO and several other colleagues to 
communicate precisely that. 
APPROPRIATIONS 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, this week, Democrats on the House 
Appropriations Committee are doing 
something so radical that it hasn’t 
been done for decades. They are ad-
vancing an annual funding bill that 
leaves out the Hyde amendment, the 
commonsense prohibition on forcing 
taxpayers to fund abortion. 
Since the 1970s, abortion has claimed 
the lives of more than 60 million un-
born children. But at the very, very 
least, the mainstream, bipartisan Hyde 
amendment has ensured that tax-
payers’ hard-earned money is not fun-
neled into this brutal practice. 
A broad, bipartisan coalition agreed 
the American taxpayers should not be 
forced to underwrite this nightmare. 
And, by the way, a strong majority of 
Americans still agree with that propo-
sition. 
For decades, nearly his entire career, 
then-Senator Joe Biden was a reliable 
supporter of Hyde protections. One let-
ter to a constituent read like this: 
Those of us who are opposed to abortion 
should not be compelled to pay for them. 
But a couple of years ago, on the 
President’s campaign trail, our former 
colleague changed his tune. He let the 
demands of the increasingly radical 
left overcome a principle he had held 
literally for decades. 
So earlier this year, the President’s 
budget 
request 
obligingly 
proposed 
ending this longstanding protection. 
Yet another way in which the adminis-
tration that sold itself as moderate and 
unifying is now spiraling way, way to 
the left. And this week, the House is 
following through. 
In today’s Democratic Party, there is 
no room to dissent from the far left’s 
culture war, even in the most modest, 
most longstanding, most widely pop-
ular ways. 
Senate Republicans are going to con-
tinue standing up for life, standing up 
for taxpayers, and standing up for the 
conscience rights of millions, millions 
of Americans who don’t want the gov-
ernment laundering their hard-earned 
money to abortion providers. Repub-
licans will stand with the majority of 
the American people, even if our col-
leagues across the aisle have given in 
to the most radical voices. 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Madam President, now, on one final 
matter, earlier this week, new June 
figures further confirmed what work-
ing families across America already 
know all too well: Runaway costs are 
hitting the American people where it 
hurts. 
Sadly, this was 100 percent predict-
able. Even top Democratic experts, like 
Larry Summers, warned that the jaw- 
dropping $2 trillion that Democrats 
borrowed and spent back in March 
might unleash inflation and do more 
harm than good. 
The economy was already packed 
with dry powder. Households already 
had record savings. Supply chains and 
inventories 
were 
already 
strapped. 
American families did not need a grand 
socialist experiment. They just needed 
the government to let things finally, fi-
nally, get back to normal. 
But the President, the Speaker, and 
the Democratic leader still slapped an-
other $2 trillion on the country’s credit 
card, and it has bought us a level of in-
flation that is unprecedented in recent 
memory. 
Costs for working families have shot 
up. Inflation is running so hot that 
even though American workers have 
seen a 3.6-percent pay increase on aver-
age since last year, it has been com-
pletely swamped, wiped out and then 
some by inflation. In real terms, Amer-
ican workers’ pay has actually gone 
down—down—nearly 2 percent since 
last July. 
So let me say this again. On Demo-
crats’ watch, inflation has turned a 3.6- 
percent annual pay raise for Americans

July 15, 2021 
into a nearly 2-percent pay cut. And 
yet, in a spectacle that could only 
occur 
in 
Washington, 
Democrats 
picked the very same week to an-
nounce they want to tax, borrow, and 
spend yet another—listen to this—$4 
trillion in the coming weeks. Yet an-
other budget socialist package twice as 
big—twice as big—as the last one. 
I am sure this is just what working 
Americans want to hear. They are al-
ready struggling to keep up with the 
soaring cost of gas, groceries, diapers, 
housing, automobiles—you name it. 
And now the Democrats’ big idea is to 
try and inflate their way out of infla-
tion? Inflate their way out of inflation. 
That will be one wild ride for working 
Americans, middle-class families, and 
anybody with any savings. 
For good measure, Democrats say 
they will probably pair this spending 
spree with a set of massive tax hikes, 
dumped right on top of our economic 
recovery. 
Our colleagues need to take this sum-
mer and think very carefully about 
what they are discussing. It would be 
hard to imagine a proposal less suited 
to the conditions of our country at this 
point. Americans cannot afford another 
socialist borrowing, taxing, and spend-
ing spree that will kill jobs and raise 
costs for working families. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
just heard the Republican leader refer 
to the American Rescue Plan as a 
grand socialist experiment. Remember 
that plan? That was President Biden’s 
response to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
How many Republicans voted for it? 
Not one. Not a House Member nor a 
Senate Member of the Republican 
Member supported it. 
So what was in this socialist experi-
ment? Well, the premiere piece was to 
make sure we distributed the COVID–19 
vaccine to every American. Obviously, 
some people think that is socialism. I 
think it is common sense. And the 
more and more Americans who are im-
munized, the more we escape the grasp 
of this pandemic; 99.5 percent of those 
who are admitted to the hospital today 
with serious COVID–19 symptoms are 
unvaccinated. 
So this was socialism? I don’t think 
so. How about the aid we gave to small 
businesses to stay open or reopen? 
That was in the American Rescue Plan. 
That was Biden’s plan. There was not a 
single Republican vote for it. 
Money to help businesses to reopen is 
socialism? Is that what the Senator 
from Kentucky is suggesting? Or how 
about the fact that today we are going 
to see across the United States of 
America help to families, middle-in-
come families, working families, low- 
income families to raise their children? 
So when Donald Trump writes a 
check for $2,000 to every American fam-
ily, that is just fine, but when the 
Democrats and Biden want to give 
money to families raising children, 
particularly those who are struggling 
to raise children, that is socialism? I 
think not. It is common sense. 
If we really value families, we are 
going to invest in their future. And the 
money that is being sent starting 
today to these families will lift half of 
the children in poverty in America out 
of poverty for the first time. That is a 
dramatic achievement. It should be a 
bipartisan achievement. Sadly, it is a 
Democratic achievement because the 
Republicans boycotted the vote over 
and over. 
There is one thing that the Senator 
from Kentucky fails to mention when 
he talks about the budget resolution— 
maybe two things are worth saying. 
First is this budget resolution, which 
we are going to bring to the floor next 
week, according to the leader, is going 
to do dramatic things across America 
in terms of pre-K education, 2 years of 
community college and the like. And 
in this circumstance, it is paid for. It is 
all paid for. 
So to say it is inflationary is to sug-
gest that it is not paid for as adding to 
the debt. Who pays for it? Those mak-
ing over $400,000 a year in income and 
corporations. That is who pays for it. 
And the net result of it: The biggest 
tax cut in the history of the United 
States for middle-income and working 
families. That is the reality. 
I am going to yield the floor. I see 
the Senator from South Dakota has 
come to the floor and I know he wanted 
to speak. We have a few minutes left. I 
yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, it 
didn’t take long. Just a year since 
‘‘defund the police’’ became a rallying 
cry and cities started cutting money 
from police budgets, crime is surging. 
At the beginning of June, the New 
York Times reported: 
Homicide rates in large cities were up 
more than 30 percent on average last year, 
and up another 24 percent for the beginning 
of this year. 
Homicides are up in New York City, 
Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, 
Columbus; and the list goes on. And it 
isn’t only homicide rates that have 
risen. During the first 4 months of the 
year, Los Angeles saw a 73-percent in-
crease in shootings. 
As of the end of May, Portland, OR, 
which has been ravaged by violent riots 
over the past year, was on track to ex-
ceed 1,000 shootings for this year, as 
compared to 389 in 2019. 
A Washington Examiner piece from 
June reported: 
Through the first 14 weeks of this year, 
New York City saw an 81 percent increase in 
shootings, the highest number of shootings 
during the same time period since 2002. Rob-
beries, grand larcenies, felony assaults, and 
shootings have all increased in April and 
May compared to last year. 
San Francisco has seen a surge in car 
break-ins, among other crimes, with 
the San Francisco Chronicle reporting 
in June that ‘‘last month, the Police 
Department’s Central Station saw a 753 
percent increase in auto burglaries 
compared to the previous May.’’ 
In Oakland, CA, carjackings are up 
almost 88 percent, shootings are up 70 
percent, and homicides are up 90 per-
cent. 
Unfortunately, I could go on all day. 
The crime surge is real, and it is fright-
ening. I quoted a lot of statistics and 
percentages, but there are real people 
behind every one of those crimes—peo-
ple whose lives have been cut short or 
ravaged by violence, people whose 
sense of safety has been destroyed. 
It 
turns 
out 
that—surprise— 
defunding the police is a terrible idea. 
It is no coincidence at all that cities 
that have slashed their police budgets 
have seen huge increases in violence. 
Some of them are even recognizing the 
mistake they made and seeking to re-
store the funding that they cut. A Fox 
Business piece reports: 
Cities like New York City, Oakland, Balti-
more, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles are 
planning to reinstate tens of millions for the 
construction of new police precincts, in-
crease police department budgets, among 
other plans to bankroll more efforts to con-
front the uptick in crime. 
Unfortunately, the problem won’t 
necessarily be fixed that easily because 
‘‘defund the police’’ rhetoric has not 
just resulted in smaller police budgets; 
it has also resulted in police demor-
alization and left departments worried 
about deploying officers to do their 
jobs. It has resulted in a wave of police 
retirements and resignations. 
The New York Times reports: 
Thousands of police officers nationwide 
have headed for the exits in the past year. A 
survey of almost 200 police departments indi-
cated that retirements were up 45 percent 
and resignations rose by 18 percent in the 
year from April 2020 to April 2021 when com-
pared with the previous 12 months. 
That is from the New York Times. 
The city of Asheville, NC, has lost 
one-third of its police force—one-third, 
Mr. President. It is not surprising. It 
turns out that when you spend months 
vilifying police officers and demonizing 
them for doing their jobs, some of them 
no longer want to stay. This is perhaps 
the worst consequence of the ‘‘defund 
the police’’ movement. 
Cutting police budgets is not a good 
idea, but resources and equipment can 
be built back up again, sometimes fair-
ly quickly. It is a lot harder to replace 
good seasoned officers with years of ex-
perience 
protecting 
public 
safety. 
While it would be hard to replace them 
at any time, it is particularly hard 
today because it is difficult to imagine 
why anyone would want to become a 
police officer right now. Why would 
good men and women sign up for a job 
where they are regularly characterized 
as the worst kind of criminals? Why 
would they sign up knowing they may

be prevented from or punished for 
doing the job we ask them to do? 
Violence against police officers—al-
ways a danger—is up. The sickening 
scene of protesters shouting ‘‘death to 
police’’ outside a hospital where two 
ambushed law enforcement officers 
were fighting for their lives has to be 
emblazoned on the minds of police offi-
cers nationwide. Again I ask, why 
would anyone want to join the police 
under these conditions? 
The ‘‘defund the police’’ movement is 
not only costing us many good officers 
today, it has depleted the pool of good 
officers for the future, and that is a 
travesty. 
The unfortunate truth is, the Demo-
crats bear a substantial amount of re-
sponsibility for the situation we find 
ourselves in because this is a party 
that either actively contributed to the 
‘‘defund the police’’ rhetoric or implic-
itly endorsed it by largely staying si-
lent, not to mention the less-than-cen-
sorious attitude the Democrats fre-
quently displayed when it came to the 
violence and property destruction of 
last summer and the past year. 
California 
Representative 
MAXINE 
WATERS said protesters in Minneapolis 
this 
April 
should 
‘‘get 
more 
confrontational’’ should the verdict in 
the Chauvin trial not go their way. 
Far-left Members of the House of 
Representatives spent the past year 
making statements like these: 
Policing in our country is inherently and 
intentionally racist. 
No more policing, incarceration, and mili-
tarization. 
Now, more mainstream Democrats 
have become wise to the fact that their 
party’s association with the ‘‘defund 
the police’’ movement may threaten 
their electoral chances next year. As 
polling demonstrated, Americans are 
squarely against the idea of defunding 
the police. So the President and other 
Democratic leaders all of a sudden an-
nounced their concern about surging 
crime, but they are still trying to have 
their cake and eat it, too, because 
missing from their messaging is any 
real condemnation of ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ rhetoric and the terrible toll it 
has taken on our cities and police de-
partments. 
In fact, President Biden, who is cur-
rently trying to reinvent himself as 
tough on crime, filled key roles in the 
Department of Justice with individuals 
who have gone on record with their 
support for defunding the police. Presi-
dent Biden’s Secretary of Labor actu-
ally cut police funding while serving as 
Boston’s mayor, and his Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development has 
suggested that we should consider de-
creasing police budgets. 
Democrats’ 
actual 
crime-fighting 
plans are long on punishing gun dealers 
and gun manufacturers and short on 
actually going after criminals. The 
President’s nominee to head the Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives seems more interested in 
targeting law-abiding gun owners than 
in dealing with the surge in gun crime. 
I have one last point to make about 
the ‘‘defund the police’’ movement, and 
that is its fundamental injustice. Are 
there bad police officers out there? Of 
course there are. There are bad teach-
ers out there, too, and bad social work-
ers and bad small businessmen. But 
just as it would be outrageous to de-
monize all teachers because of a few 
bad apples in their profession, it is out-
rageous to demonize the hundreds of 
thousands of dedicated men and women 
defending public safety in this country 
because of a handful of bad offers. 
We owe our men and women in law 
enforcement a great debt—a debt we 
can’t even fully comprehend. These 
men and women go out and risk their 
lives every day of the week, every 
month of the year, to keep us safe. But 
they don’t just risk their lives; they 
also bear a heavy physical and emo-
tional burden. Most of us go about our 
daily lives without having to confront 
much evil because our law enforcement 
officers go out every day to confront it 
for us. They confront violence so that 
we don’t have to, and they pay a price. 
It is tough to have to see evil on a 
daily basis, to spend years rescuing 
children who are in trouble or sup-
porting victims of violence or bringing 
rapists to justice, but it is a price most 
of them are glad to pay. They signed up 
to protect the innocent, to keep the 
public safe and evil at bay, and they 
are proud to do it. We owe them and 
their families our profound gratitude. 
It is abhorrent that anti-police rhet-
oric has become such an accepted part 
of our national conversation and has 
been winked at or endorsed by so many 
Democratic leaders. We owe our police 
officers much better. 
I hope the belated realization among 
some that police officers are essential 
to keeping our communities safe will 
spell the end of the ‘‘defund the police’’ 
movement. It is time to focus on pro-
tecting public safety and honoring men 
and women who spend every day work-
ing to promote it. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The senior Senator from Texas. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, our 
Democratic colleagues have begun to 
lay out the groundwork for a partisan 
reconciliation bill totaling $3.5 tril-
lion—what used to be an absolutely as-
tonishing amount of money. 
We don’t have many details about 
how that money could be spent, but 
based on everything we have heard 
from President Biden and our Demo-
cratic colleagues over recent months, 
there are some safe assumptions: Medi-
care expansion, Green New Deal-era 
climate initiatives, and a range of free 
programs that we know aren’t free at 
all—college, childcare; you name it. 
To pay for these runaway spending 
habits, our Democratic colleagues will 
lean on job-killing tax increases and 
excessive borrowing from future gen-
erations. As a reminder, this is only 
one-half of the dual-track strategy 
they are pushing this month. The other 
half is more than $1 trillion worth of 
infrastructure. 
And I would note that while there is 
strong bipartisan support for an infra-
structure bill, that the Democratic 
leader is apparently intending to file 
for cloture on a motion to proceed to a 
bill that hasn’t even been written yet, 
much less had a Congressional Budget 
Office score to see whether the pay-fors 
are meaningful or phony. 
As I see it, our friends on the other 
side have made it even more difficult 
to convince our colleagues, let alone 
the American people, that this type of 
spending is necessary. After all, they 
have already developed a spotty record 
this year. At a time when our debts 
were piling up, they added up even 
more unnecessary spending. 
Back in March, Democrats spent 
nearly $2 trillion without the support 
of a single Republican. They claimed 
this was all in the name of COVID–19 
relief, even though less than 10 percent 
directly supported our pandemic re-
sponse. The rest was a grab bag of irre-
sponsible spending. 
One case in point is the blue State 
bailout. Democrats spent $350 billion 
more in aid to State and local govern-
ments, many of which were not even 
facing any sort of budget shortfalls. 
Democrats said the jobs of everybody 
from police officers to teachers would 
be in jeopardy without this funding. 
Republicans offered that this huge 
sum of funding wasn’t needed since 
many States were not operating in the 
red. Even liberal economists and non-
partisan groups, like the Committee 
for a Responsible Federal Budget, 
agreed. 
But as the old saying goes, time tells 
all. And it didn’t take much time for us 
to see how completely unnecessary this 
$350 billion payout was. Take Cali-
fornia as an example. California has 
more than $100 billion budget surplus. 
That is with a capital ‘‘B.’’ Governor 
Newsom is using that money to dole 
out stimulus checks and provide med-
ical coverage for undocumented immi-
grants. 
New Jersey has had so much extra 
cash lying around that it has made its 
first full payment into the State’s pen-
sion system in more than 25 years. But 
they didn’t stop there. It exceeded that 
payment by more than half a billion 
dollars. 
This was exactly the kind of reckless 
spending of supposed COVID–19 dollars 
borrowed against future generations 
that we advocated against because we 
saw a tidal wave of funding going to 
States that were not even operating in 
the red. 
One recent POLITICO article read: 
State Faced Financial Ruin. Now they’re 
swimming in cash. 
The Wall Street Journal Editorial 
Board asked: ‘‘Didn’t States Say They 
Were Broke?’’ 
At a time when our spending already 
mirrored wartime expenses, Democrats 
handed States piles of cash to erase 
debts and add to rainy-day funds, not 
to provide for COVID–19 relief.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4917 
July 15, 2021 
This money could have been used to 
invest in our roads and bridges, to have 
credible pay-fors for the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill that is currently being 
considered, or to increase broadband 
access in rural communities, or to sup-
port the response to the immigrant cri-
sis occurring on our southern border, 
or a number of other priorities. 
But rather than repurposing the sur-
plus funds from the first spending bo-
nanza, our Democratic colleagues are 
trying to double down on reckless 
spending, 
more 
irresponsible 
bor-
rowing, more unnecessary spending, 
and 
more 
burdensome 
taxes. 
This 
multitrillion-dollar 
spending 
spree 
comes at a time that is already an un-
stable one for our economy. 
Last month, inflation hit a 13-year 
high. And average prices are up 5.4 per-
cent over the last year. Now, this is 
what happens when so much money 
starts chasing limited goods and serv-
ices. The price of those goods and serv-
ices goes up. That is what helps to 
cause inflation. And consumers are the 
ones feeling the sting of rising prices 
for virtually everything they buy. 
Fruits and vegetables are up 3.2 per-
cent; electricity is up 3.8 percent; and 
dining-out costs are up 4.2 percent over 
a year ago. For families operating on a 
budget, unlike the Federal Government 
that can simply print money and bor-
row more money and impose that bur-
den on future generations—for families 
operating on a budget, especially those 
who battled job losses and other tough 
financial 
circumstances 
during 
the 
pandemic, those dollars and those ex-
penses add up awfully quick. 
And those account for only a few of 
the price increases that families are 
facing. For example, if you want to 
purchase a washer or dryer for your 
home, you are going to be met with 
some pretty serious sticker shock. 
Prices are up 26 percent over last year. 
For folks hitting the road for maybe 
a little time off during the summer-
time or maybe even just commuting 
back and forth to work will have to 
budget quite a bit more for the gaso-
line necessary to get them there. They 
are paying 45 percent more at the pump 
than they did just 1 year ago. 
And anyone heading to the used-car 
lot is bound for a big surprise. Over the 
last 12 months, used-car prices are up 
an eye-popping 45.2 percent. We know 
one contributing factor is the shortage 
of semiconductors necessary to run 
these computers on wheels that we now 
call cars. Without a steady supply of 
these chips, automakers haven’t been 
able to manufacture the normal num-
ber of new vehicles, making used ones 
a particular hot commodity. 
This is another reason why the House 
needs to take up the bipartisan U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act, which 
passed the Senate last month. It can 
take literally years to get new semi-
conductor foundries or manufacturing 
facilities up and running. And time is 
of the essence. Getting this bill signed 
into law will help bolster domestic chip 
production and safeguard against simi-
lar shortages in the future. 
But getting back to these rising costs 
depicted here on this chart, these kinds 
of across-the-board cost increases are 
simply unmanageable for many fami-
lies. I know it is easy sitting here in 
Washington, DC, getting a government 
salary, to think that, well, people can 
manage. But if you are a working fam-
ily, particularly one coming off of lay-
offs or reduced hours as a result of the 
COVID–19 mitigation efforts, these are 
real. And they bite into the economics 
of these families. 
As bad as inflation is, it is only one 
part of our economic woes. We are also 
seeing trouble getting people to go 
back to work. In February last year, 
before the pandemic hit, the unemploy-
ment rate was 3.5 percent. The econ-
omy was hitting on all cylinders. But 
within 2 months, unemployment went 
from 3.5 percent to 15 percent. 
Since then, thanks to our invest-
ments and bipartisan cooperation and 
our great scientists, we have made 
steady progress in getting workers 
back on the job. But, unfortunately, 
our Democratic colleagues have seen 
fit to incentivize men and women to re-
main on the sidelines of the labor mar-
ket. 
The partisan bill they passed earlier 
this year extended, bolstered unem-
ployment benefits through the end of 
September, long after we expected our 
economy to reopen. 
It was literally true with the $300 
Federal supplement to State unem-
ployment benefits. People receiving 
unemployment benefits in my State, 80 
percent of them got more from unem-
ployment than they did from their 
former jobs. 
That is simply the wrong kind of in-
centives to try to incentivize people 
not to work. We need to incentivize 
and facilitate people getting back to 
work so they can support their fami-
lies. 
So it is no wonder our economy is 
still struggling to rebound. A partisan 
go-it-alone strategy has not led to posi-
tive results for our country. It has 
driven up debt, deficits, borrowing, and 
spending. And for what? 
The American people are spending 
more of their hard-earned money on ev-
eryday items. Workers are sitting on 
the sidelines of the labor markets. And 
our national debt is at a higher level 
than it was following World War II. 
In the last election—contrary to, per-
haps, the belief among some circles 
here in Washington—the voters did not 
give our Democratic colleagues a man-
date. They didn’t sign off on the far- 
left agenda or give a green light to 
spend trillions and trillions of dollars 
on unnecessary liberal programs. 
If they wanted BERNIE
SANDERS’ 
multitrillion-dollar budget, they would 
have elected him President of the 
United States. But we know that did 
not happen. 
Voters elected a 50–50 Senate, less-
ened the Democratic majority in the 
House, and took President Biden at his 
word that he promised to work across 
the aisle. This far left—hard left turn 
is not what the American people voted 
for. 
Republicans will continue to fight 
this irresponsible spending bonanza 
once again. And I hope, I hope some of 
our Democratic colleagues will stand 
with us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I see a 
very 
different 
country, 
apparently, 
from my colleague. And I respect Sen-
ator CORNYN. 
I sat at this desk on March 6. We had 
been voting, as the Presiding Officer 
from Hawaii remembers. We had been 
voting all night. It was a Saturday at 
about 12:30. We had voted for about 11 
hours. And we defeated by one vote an 
amendment where Senator GRASSLEY 
and my colleagues from the Finance 
Committee and the Senate Republicans 
tried to delete the child tax credit from 
the American Rescue Plan. We then 
took a second vote around noon on Sat-
urday, after 11 or 12 hours of voting, 
where we passed the American Rescue 
Plan by one vote. 
Two different times, the Republican 
Party, which always votes for tax cuts 
for the richest people in the country, 
always on party-line votes, always 
under the very discredited theory that 
with tax cuts the dollars trickle down 
to workers and to the middle class and 
the rest of the country—they will al-
ways vote for a big tax cut for rich peo-
ple, but they opposed twice—unani-
mously opposed, every single one op-
posed—the child tax credit. 
(Mr. KING assumed the Chair.) 
Today is the magic day. I remember 
saying to Senator CASEY, when we 
passed the American Rescue Plan, that 
this is the best day of my career in 
public service because we are going to 
reduce the child poverty rate by 50 per-
cent. 
This isn’t a tax cut for rich people, so 
they can buy another home or another 
yacht or another vacation place. This 
is money in the pockets of working- 
class and middle-class and struggling 
people from Maine and Ohio and Texas 
and Iowa and all over the country. 
So, today, people should start check-
ing their bank accounts, looking at 
their phones, checking their bank ac-
counts, 
looking 
in 
their 
mailbox. 
Starting today—today, Friday, Satur-
day, Monday—the great majority of 
American families will see this tax cut. 
They will see this $250 or $300 a month. 
They are going to start receiving it. 
There will be $250 if the child is 6 or 
over. There will be $250 6 to 17. If they 
are 5 or under, it will be $300 per month 
per child—on July 15, August 15, Sep-
tember 15, October, November, Decem-
ber. 
Then, with the second half of the tax 
cut, they will get a lump sum starting 
next year when they file their taxes.

State—92 percent of children under 18— 
are eligible for this. 
These are all numbers and these are 
all statistics, but here is what it 
means. I did a series of roundtables in 
Cleveland and Columbus and Dayton 
and Cincinnati and Toledo and Youngs-
town and Fremont and Bryan and Defi-
ance, OH. Here is what I heard. One 
woman said: You know, my son, for the 
first time in his life, I can send him for 
a week at summer camp because of this 
child tax credit. 
A father said: I can buy the equip-
ment for my daughter to play fastpitch 
softball now. 
Another said: I am so anxious—I 
heard this many times—I am so anx-
ious at the end of every month during 
the last week. How am I going to cob-
ble together the money to pay my 
rent? And often I have to choose be-
tween buying enough food and paying 
my rent. 
Others said: Now I can work more 
hours because I can afford daycare for 
my children. 
A few said things like: You know, 
now, per child—my babies are 3 and 4 
years old—I can put $100 a month aside 
for each of them so they can go to Lor-
raine Community College or Sinclair 
or Northwest State Community College 
or Ohio State University or Denison. 
They can get a start on saving money. 
Why wouldn’t we want to do that? 
We talk about infrastructure around 
here. Infrastructure is building a foun-
dation so families can launch their 
children to a better life. And providing 
families $250 or $300 a month—month 
after month after month—gives those 
families, give those kids an oppor-
tunity they never would have had. Why 
wouldn’t we think this is the best day 
this Congress has had in 25 years when 
we do that? It is pretty simple. 
You know what I really like about 
this—and I know the Presiding Officer 
appreciates that in Maine; Senator 
KING in Maine, Senator GRASSLEY in 
Iowa—we don’t make the decisions 
about what these parents should do. We 
provide them the dollars. They spend it 
best, whether it is a family in Dubuque 
or a family in Portland or whether it is 
a family in Mansfield or Cleveland. I 
don’t know what is best for them. We 
provide them the dollars. They make 
the decision of what is best for their 
child—summer camp, diapers, softball 
games, saving for college, just having 
enough to eat, occasionally getting to 
go out to a diner down the street in 
Lima, OH. All those kinds of decisions, 
let the parents make. 
We are giving them that. If we care 
about family values, if we care about 
our families, give them a little more 
help. It will make a huge difference in 
their lives. 
That is why it is so important. It 
starts today, then next month, and the 
month after, for a year. 
We need to renew this. We need to 
make sure it is permanent. If we do 
that, it is going to launch a whole gen-
eration of kids and give them more op-
portunity. What is not to love about 
that? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, why 
is there such an increase in violent 
crimes in American cities? 
In New York City, the murder rate is 
up 37 percent from 2 years ago; in At-
lanta, 53 percent from 2019. In Port-
land, OR, murders have increased over 
500 percent. 
So everybody is asking: What is 
going on? 
Well, if you were to ask President 
Biden, he would say the usual rhetoric 
about how we need more gun control. 
The White House recently put out a so- 
called strategy to reduce crimes. 
What is the first thing that the 
President wants to do about this issue? 
Go after rogue gun dealers. Well, we all 
know gun dealers must follow the law, 
like doing background checks. We all 
agree on that. But I don’t think anyone 
truly believes that legal gun dealers 
are responsible for the sudden spike in 
violent crime, including our own De-
partment of Justice. 
Referring to a Department of Justice 
2019 report, inmates who committed a 
gun crime most likely got their weap-
ons from the black market—no back-
ground checks there. In fact, according 
to this report, only about 1 in 50 Fed-
eral inmates got a gun from a legal 
firearms dealer. 
Speaking of which, if Democrats real-
ly want to protect Americans from ille-
gal gun sales, they should support my 
bill, the Protecting Communities and 
Preserving the Second Amendment 
Act, which would actually do that. 
But getting back to the recent crime 
wave, the real problem is what every-
one knows but many of my friends on 
the left dare not say. The real problem 
is that for the past 14 months, police 
officers across the country have been 
vilified for doing their job, which has 
led to many of those same police leav-
ing their job. In addition, liberal com-
munities—and everybody knows most 
of our big cities of America are run by 
Democratic mayors—reduced the po-
lice forces and even reduced prosecu-
tions. The result is that in San Fran-
cisco, for example, as you see on tele-
vision, shoplifting appears to be a way 
of life. 
Some police have pulled back from 
making sure that we are all safe be-
cause in too many cities, elected offi-
cials don’t have their backs. 
Last year, Attorney General Barr en-
acted Operation Legend, which paired 
Federal law enforcement officers up 
with local police in nine cities where 
crimes were soaring. This led to the ar-
rest of 6,000 violent criminals by the 
end of last year, including hundreds of 
murderers. 
Now, does this White House have the 
will to support law enforcement so the 
police can make our streets safer? Does 
the President have their backs? 
Recently, the President’s spokes-
person said it was the Republicans who 
wanted to defund the police, not the 
Democrats. And that is just plain un-
true and everybody knows it. What 
they were trying to say is that Repub-
licans didn’t support the Democrats’ ir-
responsible 
spending 
bill 
back 
in 
March. 
That is not defunding the police. 
That is just being fiscally responsible. 
It is not Republicans who say things 
like: ‘‘No more policing, incarceration, 
or 
militarization. 
It 
can’t 
be 
re-
formed,’’ or words like ‘‘defunding the 
police means defunding the police.’’ 
Let me give you another example. 
The push to take resources away from 
law enforcement is alive and well over 
in the House. A couple of weeks ago, 
the Senate passed three bills that 
would support police. The first one is 
the Protecting America’s First Re-
sponders Act. That bill makes sure se-
riously injured first responders or their 
widows and children get the benefits 
that they are entitled to. 
The second bill, the COPS Counseling 
Act, creates a zone of privacy for police 
officers so that they can have coun-
seling sessions for traumatic experi-
ences and protect their privacy. 
A third bill, the Jaime Zapata and 
Victor Avila Federal Officers Protec-
tion Act, makes it clear that killing a 
law enforcement officer overseas is a 
crime in the United States. 
The Senate passed these bills because 
when it comes to law enforcement, we 
have their backs. 
But right now, Democratic leadership 
in the House is preventing a vote on 
these bills. Why? I don’t know. They 
are bipartisan bills that should easily 
pass with resounding support. If you 
are with me on funding the police, I 
know you will support these bills. If 
the President wants to reduce crime, 
he should tell our police: Go out there. 
Patrol our streets. We have your back. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
Members of the Senate were all home 
last week for 2 weeks during their 
State work period. It was a good time 
to get back—to get back to reality, as 
I call it, because we all know here in 
Washington, people aren’t always oper-
ating in reality. If we were, we 
wouldn’t be seeing some of the policies 
that are coming out as we speak. 
These State work periods are a great 
time to hear directly from the people 
we represent, and that is who we work 
for—what they care about and how 
they are affected by what is happening 
here in our Nation’s Capital. 
This is what folks back in Alabama 
were talking about. They were talking 
about small businesses that can’t find 
people to work because the government 
is paying more in unemployment bene-
fits than folks make on the job. And 
that is understandable. We have to un-
derstand that, and we have to under-
stand the problem and how we rectify

July 15, 2021 
that problem. We need workers in the 
State of Alabama in the worst way, al-
most in every business and in manufac-
turing. 
They were talking about an economy 
that is hurting—really hurting—for 
hard-working Americans. They were 
talking about the real costs of rising 
inflation—rising prices on goods and 
services that the average family pos-
sesses. 
While driving around, I fill my truck 
up with gas. The cost was double what 
I spent just a few months ago, and that 
affects every American in this country. 
By the way, in June, consumer prices 
increased 5.4 percent. I got an earful 
from people about bread, eggs, and 
milk, all across the State of Alabama. 
I am sure that the people of Alabama 
are not alone in their concerns. 
This didn’t happen by accident. This 
is the direct result of us up here spend-
ing way too much money, flooding the 
country with money that is out—I call 
it invisible money—out there just 
going into people’s pockets that either 
they are saving, putting in the stock 
market, or spending on goods. 
This makes the timing of the Presi-
dent’s proposed tax increases even 
worse. Simply put, President Biden’s 
proposal is launching an all-out assault 
on the working Americans in this 
country, people who work hard for the 
money they put in their pocket to pay 
for the things that their family needs. 
Altogether, 
President 
Biden 
has 
called for 30—let me repeat that—30 
different tax increases on the American 
people that total over $3 trillion. 
This is the worst time—the worst 
time—that we could be pushing a new 
tax increase, especially during this 
pandemic, which we thought was com-
ing to a close, but it looks like we are 
not even close to that. So this would be 
the worst time for us to be raising 
taxes. Businesses and families have 
worked very hard to make progress 
after a very, very tough year and a 
half, and it has been tough. Higher 
taxes would set most, if not all, back 
even further. 
The President’s budget laid down a 
marker. It lays out straight the prior-
ities of the administration. It spot-
lights areas where the American public 
can expect a political emphasis. Well, 
with his budget, President Biden has 
telegraphed the types of tax increases 
that Congress can deploy to pay for his 
progressive policies. We are sure to see 
a few of them in the new reconciliation 
package. I am not going to talk about 
all 30 proposals, but let’s take a look at 
some of the big tax increases that 
President Biden is going to propose. 
President Biden wants to raise the 
corporate rate from 21 to 28 percent, 
which was lowered just a couple of 
years ago and put money in people’s 
pockets all across the country. Now we 
are going to raise it from 21 to 28 per-
cent on corporations. That is not a tax 
on corporations; that is a tax on the 
people who work across this country, 
especially for these corporations. 
If our Democratic colleagues get 
their way, Communist China will have 
a lower corporate tax rate than the 
United States. Let me repeat that. If 
our colleagues pass this tax, we will 
have a higher corporate tax rate than 
China. Take a moment to think about 
that. 
The Biden budget targets certain in-
dustries 
that 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues don’t like, such as the oil and 
gas industry, which supports more than 
10 million good-paying jobs in this 
country. It would face nearly $150 bil-
lion in industry-specific tax increases. 
That is in addition to the already mas-
sive corporate tax increase. 
Once again, the President is undoing 
the progress made over the last few 
years. 
The 
United 
States 
became 
fully—and I mean fully—energy inde-
pendent for the first time in decades. 
As a net exporter, we exported oil and 
natural gas. What are we doing now? 
We are buying it. Since Biden has come 
into office, we have become increas-
ingly 
dependent 
on 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
OPEC, and Russia for oil and gas. 
Colleagues on the left want the gov-
ernment to subsidize expensive and in-
efficient energy, like wind and solar, so 
we can put oil and gas out of business. 
We are all for natural energy, but you 
can’t do it all at one time. You cannot 
do it all at one time. Just look at the 
people with the Keystone Pipeline who 
are out of work. They were told they 
would get shovel-ready jobs. I hear 
from them every day. There are no jobs 
out there for them like they had when 
they worked on the Keystone Pipeline. 
Many other preferred green energy 
sources require critical minerals that 
only China produces. In enforcing their 
Green New Deal policies on Americans, 
our Democratic colleagues are forcing 
us to be more dependent on China for 
key resources. 
I want to say one thing about what is 
going on in China. They are getting 
ready to use a molten salt reactor that 
we invented years and years ago that 
we decided not to use. Now, they are 
starting to build it, and we are helping 
them. We are helping China to become 
energy independent off of coal in the 
future because of these nuclear reac-
tors. We invented it and shut it down, 
and now, we are going to help China 
with the progress of putting these in 
all over their country. 
All of this will effectively be a tax on 
regular 
working- 
and 
middle-class 
Americans since their energy bills will 
go sky high as a result of this all-out 
assault on our oil and gas. It makes no 
sense. 
Not content with raising taxes at 
home, our President wants to imple-
ment a 21-percent global minimum tax 
on income that U.S. businesses earn 
overseas. Now, they are going to pay 
taxes overseas already, and we are 
going to turn around and tax them 21 
percent more. Again, this is basically a 
double tax on the companies with 
international operations. Since they 
already have to pay taxes overseas, 
too, this tax would destroy American 
competitiveness. It would incentivize 
U.S. firms to headquarters overseas 
and move production offshore. We have 
got to rethink that. We have got to 
rethink it. Again, we are working for 
the American people, not for us here. 
President Biden is also calling for a 
15-percent global corporate minimum 
tax based on the misguided assumption 
that other world powers will play fair. 
Well, I can guarantee you one thing: 
Russia and China are not going to play 
fair. We cannot count on anybody 
other than our allies. Everybody else is 
on their own. Even for the countries 
that do play fair, this international 
rate is lower than the 28-percent rate 
that companies headquartered in the 
United States would have to pay. 
So what does that mean? It means in-
versions are going to spread like wild-
fire, and large business corporations 
are going to move their headquarters 
overseas. We cannot allow that to hap-
pen. We are going to lose jobs. 
What is more, the President’s budget 
calls to increase the IRS’s budget by 
$80 billion over the next decade and add 
thousands of new agents. The President 
wants even more tax collectors to 
knock on your door and shake you 
down for all you are worth. I don’t 
know if you have ever been audited. I 
have been several times, and it ain’t a 
lot of fun. So what we are going to do 
is add even more people. If you get a 
tax refund, you are going to be audited. 
If you get some kind of refund, they 
are coming. 
We are talking about the same Agen-
cy that aggressively targeted conserv-
ative groups and individuals during the 
Obama administration. Now that there 
is another Democrat in the White 
House, the IRS is up to its old tactics 
again. We cannot politicize the IRS 
again. 
In just the past few months, the IRS 
has leaked the tax returns of American 
taxpayers to other groups. Now, to me, 
that really needs to be investigated. It 
has all gone down in the wash. For 
some reason, nobody is looking at this. 
Even more outrageously, news re-
cently broke that a Christian organiza-
tion based in Texas was denied tax-ex-
empt status by the IRS. They were de-
nied. Why? Because the IRS, for some 
reason, thinks the Bible is too closely 
associated with the Republican Party. 
That is ridiculous, absolutely ridicu-
lous. It is sad commentary on where 
America is today. What is next? Is the 
IRS going to start pulling the tax-ex-
empt status from churches? I hope not, 
but if we are adding all of these other 
agents, we are going to run into more 
and more problems. 
Before Congress even thinks about 
giving the IRS a dime more, the Agen-
cy must demonstrate that it treats all 
Americans—and I repeat, all Ameri-
cans—equally and protects our per-
sonal tax information. Individuals re-
sponsible for the most recent leak 
must be prosecuted. We have to get 
control of the IRS. For some reason, 
they are out of control.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4920 
July 15, 2021 
Sadly, there is more. The President’s 
administration also has its sights on 
small business owners—this is huge in 
my State and in a lot of other small 
States in this country, especially in 
farming communities—family farmers, 
middle-class Americans who would like 
to pass on to their children what they 
have worked so hard to build. By end-
ing the longstanding step-up in basis 
rule, the President would force anyone 
who inherits something to pay capital 
gains tax on that asset at the time of 
inheritance. 
I want you to think about what that 
is going to do to millions of people, to 
millions 
of 
family 
members. 
This 
doesn’t just apply to folks who inherit 
millions in wealth, and I know, as we 
all know, that is probably what this is 
aimed at; it would slam middle-class 
folks who inherit family farmland or a 
house or a small business. 
I am going to say this: After cam-
paigning for 2 years and in going 
throughout my State of Alabama and 
talking to our farmers, if we lose our 
family farms in this country to big cor-
porations, we are going to be in huge 
trouble. This is exactly what this is 
going to do. If we tax them at the time 
of inheritance, we are going to have 
huge problems. Many would have to 
sell their businesses just to pay the 
taxes, and it would destroy American 
jobs in the process. We need to give in-
centives to small businesses, farmers, 
and the like to make sure they under-
stand and know that they can work 
hard and pass it down from generation 
to generation. 
Opposition to this particular tax in-
crease 
is 
bipartisan. 
Congressman 
DAVID SCOTT of Georgia, a Democrat 
and chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, wrote to President Biden: 
Step-up in basis is a critical tool enabling 
family farming operations to continue from 
generation to generation. The potential for 
capital gains to be imposed on heirs at death 
of the landowner would impose a significant 
financial burden on these operations. 
This is a terrible—I mean a terrible— 
tax on small business and the Amer-
ican people. I agree with the Congress-
man. 
The American dream is about work-
ing hard so that your kids can have a 
better life than you did. That is why 
my parents worked so hard to give me 
and my brother and sister a chance. My 
dad never made over $15,000 a year, and 
we thought we were rich. We were ac-
tually poor, but they never let on to 
that. They worked hard to give us the 
opportunity to go to school, to get an 
education, and to try to make some-
thing of ourselves. I know that mil-
lions of mothers and fathers across the 
country feel the same way. 
When you boil it down, the tax plan 
is really just a tax on the American 
dream. We cannot take away the Amer-
ican dream from the American people. 
That is what we have lived off of. That 
is what we believe in. 
So why do we need to raise taxes so 
badly? It is in order to, obviously, fi-
nance all of the money that, in the last 
year and a half or 2 years, we have 
pushed out onto the public and for 
what we are going to do in the future. 
We have to tax. 
I keep hearing people say: Well, we 
are not going to raise taxes. 
Let me tell you that money doesn’t 
grow on trees, so we had better find 
some way to understand that in the 
very near future or we are going to lose 
the future of our kids in this country. 
We can’t let any of these tax proposals 
creep into the legislation that we are 
seeing. We can’t let them do that. We 
can’t let our policies overtake the 
things that will overcome our kids’ fu-
ture—and not just that of our kids. I 
used to say our kids and grandkids. 
Heck, it is us too. We are getting to the 
point now of no return, but we are 
looking at a package here in the next 
few weeks that is going to be $3.5 tril-
lion, possibly even more. That is 
unfathomable. It is hard to understand. 
We have got to get this country back 
going again after the pandemic. Let 
the American people do it. We don’t 
need to do it in this building. That is 
not our obligation. Our obligation is to 
give the people of this country the op-
portunity to get a job because growth 
and prosperity are what have made this 
country great, and that is what we 
need to continue to do. 
The root of the problem, I believe, is 
that a lot of people think that they can 
spend the hard-working people’s money 
better than they can. They say: Trust 
us because Big Government knows 
best. Folks, Big Government is going 
to put us under—6 feet under. Govern-
ments have been making that argu-
ment to people for centuries. 
I would say this: In our growing up, 
look at the things that we as the gov-
ernment have taken control of, and 
you name me one thing that has been 
prosperous. I have thought long and 
hard about that. We try to put people 
to work through the Federal Govern-
ment, and it doesn’t work. We have got 
to allow it to happen through small 
businesses and corporations. 
Kings and Queens would demand 
more money from the people, but the 
monarchy felt that they were entitled 
to it. That was normal throughout the 
world until the United States was 
formed. 
We formed this country because of 
Kings and Queens saying: We know how 
to spend your money. We know how to 
spend your money more than you do. 
So the Founders wanted a country 
that was of and by and for the people, 
and that is why the United States of 
America was formed—because the peo-
ple built this country, not government. 
Thankfully, they set up a system 
that allows us to voice our opposition 
to taxes through democratic means. 
When the government tries to raise 
taxes, the American people have the 
opportunity to let their voices be heard 
at the ballot box. 
Just remember that when you earn, 
grow, and work hard to preserve your 
money, it is your money, not the gov-
ernment’s. 
Our President would do well to re-
member that he serves at the will of 
the American people and not the other 
way around. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
NOMINATION OF TIFFANY P. CUNNINGHAM 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week the Senate is going to consider 
Tiffany Cunningham’s nomination to 
serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit. 
This is truly historic. Once con-
firmed, Ms. Cunningham will be the 
first—the very first—African-American 
judge to serve on the Federal Circuit. 
She will not only bring diversity but 
an amazing set of credentials to the 
job. You see, the Federal Circuit is 
unique among Federal appeals courts. 
The jurisdiction of other appeals courts 
is based on geography—in other words, 
where the case arises. The Federal Cir-
cuit is a specialized court, with juris-
diction over particular legal issues, es-
pecially patent law. 
This court plays a critical role in en-
suring that our innovation economy 
can continue to flourish. It requires 
judges who understand the complicated 
law that governs this area and who un-
derstand the experiences of Americans 
from all walks of life. Ms. Cunningham 
is that person. She received her under-
graduate degree in chemical engineer-
ing from MIT and her law degree from 
Harvard Law School. After graduating 
law school, she clerked for the Federal 
Circuit. 
Ms. Cunningham boasts years of ex-
perience that will serve her well. For 
almost two decades, she worked as an 
intellectual property litigator in my 
home State of Illinois. 
In that role, Ms. Cunningham cul-
tivated an in-depth understanding of 
every aspect of patent litigation, from 
the filing of the case, through dis-
covery, trial, and appeal. 
She has also represented clients 
across a number of the fields, including 
mechanical 
engineering, 
chemicals, 
pharmaceuticals, 
biotech, 
computer 
science, and the automobile industry. 
Ms. Cunningham’s clients include high- 
tech and Fortune 500 companies. 
Given her experience representing 
plaintiffs and defendants, she under-
stands the importance of applying the 
law evenhandedly. 
Her technical expertise, her deep 
knowledge of patent law, and 20 years 
of experience as an intellectual prop-
erty litigator earned her a unani-
mous—unanimous—rating 
of 
‘‘well 
qualified’’ from the American Bar As-
sociation. 
She received broad bipartisan sup-
port in my committee, with five Re-
publicans joining all Democrats in vot-
ing to advance her. 
As a judge in the Federal Circuit, Ms. 
Cunningham will offer a perspective 
shaped by personal and professional ex-
perience that reflect the diversity of 
our Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4921 
July 15, 2021 
Given her years of experience work-
ing on issues germane to the Federal 
Circuit, she will be ready upon con-
firmation to hit the ground running. 
Mr. President, at the end of her hear-
ing, I said to her say: ‘‘Why did you 
want to do this? Why would you go into 
public life? It seems like things are 
going pretty well for you as a lawyer.’’ 
She said: ‘‘It has always been my 
dream to serve on this bench.’’ 
Well, I hope her dream comes true 
and the Senate helps her reach it. I 
urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing in favor of Ms. Cunningham’s nomi-
nation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise again today to call for every Sen-
ator to have the opportunity to cast 
their vote on the Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act. 
It is time for us to look at this issue 
to move serious crimes like sexual as-
sault and murder out of the chain of 
command and put them in the hands of 
well-trained military prosecutors who 
are independent, impartial, and highly 
trained uniformed prosecutors. 
This is an issue that deserves ur-
gency. I began calling for this full floor 
vote on May 24. Since then, it is an es-
timate that 2,912 servicemembers will 
have been raped or sexually assaulted 
during that time; more will have been 
victims of other serious crimes. Many 
will not even report these crimes be-
cause they have no faith in the current 
system, where decisions about whether 
to prosecute are made by commanders 
and not trained lawyers. And yet this 
vote continues to be delayed and de-
nied, week after week. 
While I am glad to see that more of 
our colleagues have acknowledged that 
we must move sexual assault out of the 
chain of command, it is not enough. It 
doesn’t address the fundamental flaw 
in the military justice system, which is 
that it asks commanders to act as 
judge and jury in highly complex 
crimes that they are not trained to do. 
In fact, the training commanders get 
includes just a few hours, at the most, 
on legal topics like military justice 
and unlawful command influence. No 
one could be expected to learn in a few 
hours what it takes lawyers years of 
study and decades of experience to 
master. 
That is why this bill would move se-
rious crimes to the purview of those 
lawyers who have had the time to prop-
erly prepare for the job. 
Today, I would like to outline ex-
actly which crimes this bill would 
move out of the chain of command. Op-
ponents have tried to misrepresent 
these crimes the bill addresses. It does 
not, for example, deal with larceny 
under $1,000 or destruction of govern-
ment property. Those crimes would 
stay with the commander. 
The bill includes a finite list of 
crimes. I will read them all now: re-
cruit maltreatment, nonconsensual dis-
tribution of visual images, murder, 
manslaughter, murder of a pregnant 
mother, child endangerment, sexual as-
sault, obscene mailing, sexual assault 
of a child, voyeurism, major financial 
crimes, major fraud, robbery, bribery, 
graft, kidnapping, arson, extortion, ag-
gravated sexual assault, maiming, do-
mestic violence, stalking, perjury, ob-
struction of justice, and retaliation. 
That is it. That is the list. Those are 
crimes that have punishment of more 
than 1 year associated with them. 
I ask those who oppose this reform to 
tell me why they would expect a com-
mander with as little as a few hours of 
training to be prepared to try cases on 
obscene mailing or to be well versed on 
the elements of extortion. Tell me 
about the commander who understands 
the intricacies of using false docu-
ments to claim benefits or has the time 
to 
investigate 
complex 
financial 
frauds. Tell me about what leaves our 
commanders prepared to act as judge 
and jury in a murder trial or a kidnap-
ping case. 
Our bill simply recognizes that these 
are serious crimes that require legal 
expertise to properly review and pros-
ecute. By moving these crimes to inde-
pendent military lawyers, this reform 
allows commanders to focus on what 
they are trained to do: preparing our 
troops to fight and win our Nation’s 
wars. 
Additionally, the chairman has said 
that this bill would remove from the 
chain of command ‘‘crimes that have 
been handled by the military chain of 
command effectively for years and 
years and years.’’ 
But, actually, that is not the case. 
They haven’t been handled effectively. 
Just this week the Military Times re-
ported on the case of Private Jonathan 
Lauture, who is alleged to have shot 
and killed Jason Lindsay in June 2019, 
when Lindsay entered Lauture’s home 
in an attempt to intervene in a situa-
tion of domestic violence. 
His chain of command at Fort Bliss 
was aware of the killing, but they did 
not inform the Army’s criminal inves-
tigation division. Instead, they quickly 
reassigned him to Fort Stewart, where 
he continued to assault his wife. 
The Military Times reports: 
Army investigators had no idea that the 
shooting had even occurred, much less the 
domestic violence. . . . Lauture’s Fort Bliss 
chain of command did not inform the CID of 
the shooting. Nobody did, until a domestic 
violence investigation in December 2019 by 
Fort Stewart CID incidentally learned that 
Lauture had [allegedly] killed a man who 
was attempting to rescue his wife. 
That is how the current system han-
dles alleged murder and domestic vio-
lence. It is not only ineffective, it is 
actively concealing information and 
hampering justice. That is why the 
current system is unacceptable. 
We have to reform the system. The 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act is supported 
by experts, by servicemembers, and by 
a bipartisan filibuster-proof majority 
of Senators if we bring it to the floor. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader, in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours for debate, equal-
ly divided in the usual form; that upon 
the use or yielding back of that time, 
the Senate vote on the bill with no in-
tervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2359 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today on my own behalf and on behalf 
of my colleague Senator BILL CASSIDY. 
I know this has been true for States 
besides Louisiana, but for the last 18 
months, from a weather perspective, 
Louisiana has been a fantastic impres-
sion of hell. We have had three hurri-
canes. We have had, depending upon 
how you define them, probably 10 dif-
ferent heavy rain events. And when I 
say ‘‘heavy rain events,’’ I mean, that 
doesn’t sound very serious. I can assure 
you, it was. When you get 6, 8, 10, 12 
inches of rain in a short period of time, 
you are going to flood. I don’t care if 
you are living on Pikes Peak. You are 
going to flood. The water has to go 
somewhere. And, of course, we were 
part of the bad, debilitating freeze, as 
well, that also hit Texas very hard. 
My people are very resilient, and 
they are tough, but they are tired. 
Most Americans, when they think of 
a natural disaster, at least in connec-
tion with Louisiana, think of Hurri-
cane Katrina, and, certainly, it was a 
bad one. I was there. We never would 
have recovered without the help of the 
American people, and I will never be 
able to thank the American people 
enough for putting forth their hard- 
earned tax dollars to help us recover. 
These new hurricanes and rain events 
and freezes impacted probably close to 
one-third, maybe 40 percent of my peo-
ple. The worst part of it, but not the 
only part that was hit hard, was South-
west Louisiana. At last count, about 
100,000 homes were damaged, flooded, 
or blown over. 
They are still running the numbers. 
The damages are in the billions and bil-
lions and billions and billions of dol-
lars, and my people need help. 
The purpose of my bill today is to 
offer us help for them. My bill today 
and Senator CASSIDY’s bill today—as I 
said, I am here on behalf of Senator 
CASSIDY, as well—would authorize $1.1 
billion to help my people recover. 
Now, I want to emphasize, some peo-
ple, when they think of flooding and 
hurricanes, think of wealthy people 
with second homes, with multimillion- 
dollar dwellings on the beach. That is 
not what I am talking about. I am not 
putting down anybody who has a nice, 
expensive beach house, but that is not 
what we are talking about in Lou-
isiana. 
The people who were hit by these 
weather events, through no fault of 
their own, are just good, honest middle 
Americans who get up every day and go 
to work and obey the law. They pay 
their taxes. They try to do the right 
thing by their kids. Their biggest in-
vestment is their home, and many 
completely lost their home. Many of 
them had flood insurance, and many of 
them had homeowner’s insurance—and 
both. But it just didn’t cover their 
losses completely. So we are talking 
about middle America here, and I want 
to make that clear. 
Now, Mr. President, I am sure you 
are thinking, because I know you well 
and you are a smart man: OK, if we are 
spending $1.1 billion here, where are we 
going to get it? 
Well, I come to you today with a 
problem, but I also come to you today 
with a solution. 
I don’t want to digress too much, but, 
as you know, we are trying to build out 
5G 
in 
America, 
and 
5G 
operates 
through radio waves through the air 
called spectrum. And the FCC is in 
charge of those radio waves. A couple 
of years ago, the FCC—and those radio 
waves, by the way, belong to the Amer-
ican people. The FCC licenses them out 
to companies to use in wireless com-
munications. A few years ago, the FCC 
was about to give away what is called 
the C-band spectrum, these particular 
radio waves that would allow for 5G to 
become reality in America. And a num-
ber of us objected. We said: You know, 
you don’t own these radio waves. The 
American 
people 
own 
these 
radio 
waves. Why are you giving them away? 
And after some lively discussions, we 
finally turned the FCC around, and 
they decided to auction those radio 
waves to the highest bidder. They 
brought in $80 billion—$80 billion—and 
I am very proud of that. That money is 
sitting in an account in the Depart-
ment of the Treasury. 
Senator CASSIDY’s bill and my bill 
would authorize the use of $1.1 billion 
of that $80 billion in cash to be used 
through community development block 
grants to help my people recover. 
I can assure you that I wouldn’t be 
here today asking for this if my people 
didn’t desperately need it. They are 
hanging on. They are hanging on with 
every ounce of strength they have, but 
they are human. And, as I said, they 
are tough, but they are tired. 
For that reason, on behalf of Senator 
CASSIDY and myself, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of S. 2359, which is at the 
desk. I further ask that the bill be con-
sidered read a third time and passed, 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, we have now 
crossed $28 trillion in debt. We borrow 
more than $2 million every minute. 
The deficit last year was over $3 tril-
lion. The deficit this year will be over 
$3 trillion. There is a $1 trillion wish 
list out there for everybody. Everybody 
wants something. 
Somebody says: Oh, there is money 
in the Treasury. Guess what. There is 
not. There is a big hole, a big black 
hole in the Treasury, 28 trillion dollars’ 
worth. 
So we do have this one asset, and 
when we sell it, we should do it to pay 
down the deficit. We shouldn’t do it to 
expand government further. 
So I object to this because we are $28 
trillion in debt. We don’t have any 
money, and we should be fiscally con-
servative as we profess to be. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Nevada. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that all 
postcloture time on the Cunningham 
nomination be expired and that at 5:30 
p.m., Monday, July 19, the Senate vote 
on confirmation of the nomination; 
further, that if the nomination is con-
firmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table and the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

TRIBUTE TO EDITH RENFROW 
SMITH 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 
other day I read an article in the Chi-
cago Sun Times about an incredible 
Chicagoan 
named 
Edith 
Renfrow 
Smith. 
Yesterday, 
Edith 
celebrated 
her 
107th—let me say that again—107th 
birthday. And learning about her life 
story, it occurred to me that it is real-
ly the story of America. Edith is the 
grandchild of two people who were born 
into slavery. When she was 23, she be-
came the first Black woman to grad-
uate from Grinnell College in Iowa. 
Think about that. In just two genera-
tions, her family went from enduring 
bondage to earning a bachelor’s degree. 
After she graduated, Edith traveled 
east to Chicago in search of job oppor-
tunities. She spent a few years working 
for the University of Chicago, and she 
even served as a secretary for the first 
Black Congressman to represent a dis-
trict north of the Mason-Dixon Line: 
Oscar DePriest. 
Eventually, Edith found her calling 
as a public school teacher. She devoted 
more than two decades of her life edu-
cating our city’s children. One of her 
colleagues described her as a ‘‘master 
teacher.’’ 
As a resident of Hyde Park, where 
she raised a family with her husband 
Henry, Edith became close friends with 
Jazz legend Herbie Hancock. And in re-
cent years, she has become something 
of a living legend herself. In 2019, her 
alma mater, Grinnell College, opened a 
new library named in Edith’s honor: 
the Edith Renfrow Smith ‘37 Black 
Women’s Library. 
Edith is a humble person. She doesn’t 
claim to know all the secrets to a long, 
happy life, like the one she has lived, 
but she does have a few suggestions. 
She says, ‘‘You have to have respect 
for yourself.’’ 
‘‘Don’t let anyone disrespect you.’’ 
‘‘Listen to what people say to each 
other.’’ 
That advice is worth keeping in mind 
as we work together in this Senate to 
solve the most pressing challenges fac-
ing America, like rebuilding our infra-
structure. This body has a once-in-a- 
generation opportunity to transform 
our roadways and public transit sys-
tems, to secure a sustainable future for 
our children and grandchildren, and to 
bring broadband connectivity and clean 
drinking water to every community in 
America. 
And while we have a lot of work 
ahead of us, I am confident that if we 
take Edith’s advice—if we listen to one 
another—we can make real progress for 
the American people. 
Edith, thank you for sharing your in-
spiring story, and thank you for choos-
ing Chicago as your home. 
I wish you the best on your 107th 
birthday. 
NATIONAL MOTH WEEK 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I rise to recognize the 10th an-
nual observance of National Moth 
Week, which will be celebrated this 
year from July 17 to 25. 
What began as a plan for a statewide 
moth night in my home State of New 
Jersey evolved into a national week of 
recognition and quickly became an 
international citizen science project. 
In 2012, residents from East Brunswick, 
NJ, founded this initiative to promote 
the appreciation and conservation of 
moths and their important role in the 
ecosystem. Since then, thousands of 
people in all 50 U.S. States and 100 
countries have participated in observ-
ing and documenting moths during this 
week. 
National Moth Week encourages peo-
ple of all ages and abilities to shine a 
light on nighttime nature and record 
what they see. Moths are incredibly di-
verse members of the Lepidoptera 
order of insects, with estimates of 
150,000 to more than 500,000 moth spe-
cies. They serve as pollinators of crops 
and flowers and a food source for birds 
and other fauna. Enriching mothing 
events have been held at U.S. National 
Parks and Monuments; State, county, 
and local parks; museums, libraries, 
nature centers, and backyards. 
This scientific event is an all-volun-
teer effort coordinated by the Friends 
of the East Brunswick Environmental 
Commission with the assistance of a 
team of entomologists, researchers, 
educators, and enthusiasts around the 
world. In addition, country coordina-
tors in Asia, Africa, Europe, Central 
and South America, and Australia are 
helping to increase awareness, study 
and appreciation of moths, their in-
credible diversity, and ecological im-
portance in their own countries. 
National Moth Week has brought 
people together from many different 
cultures and ethnicities for the purpose 
of observing and protecting an impor-
tant natural resource and dispelling 
the negative conceptions some may 
have of moths. It proudly represents 
the best of the Garden State and its 
concern for the health of our environ-
ment and all of its inhabitants. 
It is my great honor to recognize the 
anniversary of National Moth Week 
and celebrate the vibrant research and 
scientific community in the State of 
New Jersey.

REMEMBERING POLLY BEMIS 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, the State 
of Idaho has had a long history with 
Chinese immigration to both our cities 
and the wilderness areas of Idaho. 
Today, I am pleased to honor Polly 
Bemis, the United States’ most famous 
Chinese pioneer woman. 
There have been many articles, books 
and even a full-length feature movie 
about Polly and her pioneering life in 
the mountains of Idaho. Born in China 
in 1853, she was sold by her parents and 
smuggled into the United States. In 
1872, Polly was brought to recently set-
tled Warren, ID, as a slave. There, she 
met Charlie Bemis, a saloon owner and 
deputy sheriff, whom she wed in 1894 
despite a State law prohibiting mar-
riage between a White and non-White 
person. 
Soon after Polly and Charlie wed, 
they moved to their homestead, the 
Bemis Ranch on the Salmon River, 
where they resided for many years. 
Polly was famed for her vast knowl-
edge of medical treatments and her 
hospitality to friends and travelers 
alike 
venturing 
down 
the 
Salmon 
‘‘River of No Return.’’ Charlie died in 
1922; however, Polly continued to live 
on her 27-acre ranch until shortly be-
fore her death in 1933 at the age of 80. 
Fifty-five years after her passing, 
Polly’s cabin on Bemis Ranch was 
placed on the National Register of His-
toric Places. 
As an early settler of the Idaho Ter-
ritory and an enterprising Chinese im-
migrant, Polly Bemis left an excep-
tional legacy and an indelible mark on 
Idaho’s history. While she did not re-
ceive U.S. citizenship during her life-
time, we honor her strength, industri-
ousness, and pioneering spirit in our 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. PADILLA, Mr. WYDEN, Ms. 
STABENOW, Mr. PETERS, Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND, and Mr. BENNET): 
S. 2356. A bill to provide funding to 
rehabilitate, retrofit, and remove the 
Nation’s dams to improve the health of 
the Nation’s rivers, improve public 
safety, and increase clean energy pro-
duction, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the ‘‘Twen-
ty-First Century Dams Act,’’ which I 
introduced today. I would like to thank 
Senators PADILLA, WYDEN, STABENOW, 
PETERS, GILLIBRAND, and BENNET, who 
have joined me in introducing the bill. 
This bill represents a remarkable and 
historic coalition of groups that are 
often at odds: environmentalists, the 
hydropower industry, and dam safety 
advocates have come together to ad-
vance this proposal to modernize our 
nation’s more than 90,000 dams. This 
breakthrough agreement is the result 
of a process launched three years ago 
and led by Stanford University’s Woods 
Institute and Steyer-Taylor Center for 
Energy Policy and Finance, with addi-
tional direction from the Energy Fu-
tures Initiative. 
Our Nation’s dams serve many im-
portant 
public 
purposes, 
including 
water supply, flood control, recreation, 
and, where appropriately mitigated, 
clean energy generation that will help 
slow climate change. But the dams also 
block off key habitat for fish, and can 
reduce flows needed for the health of 
rivers. 
As a result, conservationists have 
often fought proposals to upgrade older 
hydropower facilities or construct new 
water-powered energy-storage projects, 
undertaking lengthy regulatory dis-
putes over environmental safeguards. 
The historic coalition advocating for 
this bill has agreed to try a different 
approach by working together. They 
jointly support three principles for 
modernizing dams known as the ‘‘3 
Rs’’: rehabilitate, retrofit, and remove. 
1) First, rehabilitate. Our bill in-
creases investments in rehabilitating 
dams to improve their safety. Many of 
our nation’s dams were built more than 
50 years ago to safety standards that 
are insufficient today, all the more so 
because climate change is increasing 
the extreme weather events, like super 
storms, that dams will have to with-
stand to avoid catastrophic failures. 
2) Second, retrofit. Hydropower pro-
vides the United States with more than 
seven percent of its electricity and 
over 90% of its current electricity stor-
age capacity. Both the private and Fed-
eral hydropower fleet generate elec-
tricity, and hydropower facilities can 
complement variable solar and wind 
power sources and provide long-dura-
tion 
energy 
storage, 
critical 
to 
decarbonizing the grid. DOE estimates 
that by maintaining and retrofitting 
existing powered dams, U.S. hydro-
power electricity output could reduce 
carbon emissions by 5.1 billion metric 
tons by 2050 while supporting nearly 
200,000 clean energy jobs. Retrofitting 
dams also includes measures to make 
them less ecologically damaging. 
3) Third, removal. There are ample 
opportunities to remove unnecessary 
dams that no longer provide benefits to 
the population, have safety issues that 
cannot be mitigated in a cost-effective 
way, and/or have significant environ-
mental impacts that cannot be ad-
dressed. Dam removals can improve 
public safety, restore the natural func-
tions of rivers, help endangered fish 
species, create jobs, protect important 
environmental and cultural resources, 
and increase the climate resilience of 
U.S. rivers. 
I would like to now talk about how 
the bill would advance each of the ‘‘3 
Rs:’’ rehabilitations, retrofits, and re-
movals. 
Rehabilitations of dams to improve 
their safety has long been a goal of 
mine. As Ranking Member of the Sen-
ate Energy and Water Development Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, last year I 
funded for the first time the Army 
Corps of Engineers’ loan program under 
the Water Infrastructure Finance and 
Innovation Act, or WIFIA. This pro-
gram focuses on dam safety, and will 
use $14 million in federal appropria-
tions to back loans supporting approxi-
mately 
$1 
billion 
in 
dam 
safety 
projects. 
Dam safety has been underfunded at 
Federal, State, and local levels for 
many years. There are nearly 6,000 non- 
federal high hazard potential dams, 
which are at high risk of failure with 
probable loss of human life if they were 
to fail. The Association of State Dam 
Safety officials has estimated that the 
total cost of rehabilitating these dams 
exceeds $20 billion. 
The bill proposes a series of invest-
ments to meet this critical need:

FEMA’s grant program for non-Fed-
eral high hazard potential dams would 
be funded at $1 billion over 5 years, up 
from $10–12 million per year in recent 
years. 
2) USDA’s Watershed Protection and 
Flood Prevention Act would provide 
another $500 million for rehabilitating 
non-Federal dams over 5 years, up from 
just $10 million in the most recent ap-
propriations bill. 
3) The Army Corps’ WIFIA program, 
which I mentioned earlier, would be 
funded at $250 million over 5 years, a 
250% increase over the most recent ap-
propriations bill. This could support as 
much as $15 billion in loans for non- 
Federal dam safety projects. 
4) The bill would also authorize funds 
to building existing state regulatory 
oversight capacity, mapping the poten-
tial consequences of dam failure, and 
modernizing the National Dam Safety 
Program. 
Dam safety funding in the bill totals 
$2.405 billion over five years, plus $15 
billion in lending capacity to rehabili-
tate dangerous non-Federal dams. 
While public safety is paramount, it 
is also critical that we manage our 
dams as part of a comprehensive strat-
egy to address climate change. As I 
mentioned before, hydropower facili-
ties can ‘‘firm up’’ variable solar and 
wind 
power 
sources, 
critical 
to 
decarbonizing the grid, by both pro-
ducing 24/7 electricity and providing 
substantial electricity storage capac-
ity for variable resources. 
The coalition proposal has a two-part 
strategy to advance the second ‘‘R’’ of 
retrofitting dams. First is investing in 
existing Federal dams, which make up 
roughly 50% of all U.S. hydropower 
generation. Federal dam investments 
are essential to maintain this energy 
resource. 
The bill authorizes $11 billion over 
five years to improve the safety and re-
newable energy generating capacity, 
and reduce environmental impacts of 
federally owned dams across the United 
States. These investments are focused 
on the largest Federal dam-owning 
agencies, including: 
1) $8 billion for the Army Corps of 
Engineers; 
2) $2 billion for the Bureau of Rec-
lamation; 
3) $650 million for the Bureau of In-
dian Affairs; and 
4) $350 million for the Forest Service. 
The bill also authorizes $200 million 
for the Department of Energy for re-
search, development, and deployment 
to support innovative waterpower tech-
nologies, technologies to improve ret-
rofitting 
and 
rehabilitating 
hydro-
power dams, and furthering the con-
tribution of hydropower to grid resil-
ience. 
The coalition has also proposed es-
tablishing a 30% tax credit for invest-
ment at qualifying facilities in dam 
safety, environmental improvements, 
grid flexibility, and dam removals, 
with a direct pay alternative. Due to 
Senate rules regarding committee ju-
risdiction, it makes sense to move this 
tax credit provision separately. Sen-
ators CANTWELL and MURKOWSKI have 
introduced separate bipartisan legisla-
tion regarding this tax credit proposal, 
which they are actively discussing with 
the Senate Finance Committee. 
Let me now turn to the third ‘‘R’’— 
removal of unnecessary dams. Around 
the nation there are thousands of 
dams, in many cases built a century or 
more ago, which no longer provide sig-
nificant societal benefits, but block 
fish passage to critical habitats and 
otherwise harm river ecosystems. 
A twenty-first century dam strategy 
would be wholly incomplete without 
provisions to remove these unnecessary 
dams. The bill creates an interagency 
council and a stakeholder advisory 
committee to help administer funding 
to remove dams where appropriate. 
Identifying candidates for dam removal 
will follow these guiding principles: 
1) The dam owner must give consent; 
2) The priority is to remove dams 
that pose a significant public safety 
hazard, or non-powered dams whose re-
moval would provide significant eco-
logical value; and 
3) Consideration of the extent to 
which the dam provides critical bene-
ficial uses, the magnitude of public 
benefits from dam removal, and the 
cost-effectiveness and technical feasi-
bility of dam removal. 
Because dam removal can be a dif-
ficult issue, I believe it is critical to es-
tablish the framework in this bill for 
identifying which dams are appropriate 
for removal, and which are not. Within 
this framework, the bill authorizes $7.5 
billion in funding over 5 years for mul-
tiple Federal agencies with dam re-
moval authorities, including the Army 
Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Rec-
lamation, the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice, the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric 
Administration, 
the 
Forest 
Service, and the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service. 
The broad goal of these provisions is 
to reconnect 10,000 river miles through 
the removal of 1,000 dams. In addition 
to ecological benefits that could trans-
form the prospects for many endan-
gered fish populations, these projects 
would also create over 100,000 jobs. 
I want to again congratulate the hy-
dropower 
industry, 
environmental 
community, and dam safety advocates 
that have come together in the coali-
tion proposing this bill. This is an his-
toric coalition, and the coalition’s pro-
posal gives the Senate a remarkable 
opportunity to advance three critical 
goals: 
1) Rehabilitating aging dams that 
pose public safety risks and need major 
investments to withstand the extreme 
flooding events that are coming with 
climate change; 
2) Retrofitting our Federal and non- 
Federal dam fleets to increase clean 
energy generation and slow climate 
change, while reducing the dams’ envi-
ronmental impacts; and 
3) Removing unnecessary dams to 
open up critical habitat for endangered 
fish populations and restore the health 
of our precious rivers.

KUSTER (NH–02), has introduced this 
legislation in the House of Representa-

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND, 
Ms. 
KLO-
BUCHAR, 
Mr. 
PADILLA, 
Ms. 
ROSEN, Mrs. SHAHEEN, and Ms. 
SMITH): 
S. 2357. A bill to fight homelessness 
in the United States by authorizing a 
grant program within the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration 
for housing programs that offer com-
prehensive services and intensive case 
management for homeless individuals 
and families; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the ‘‘Fighting 
Homelessness with Services and Hous-
ing Act,’’ which would establish a new 
Federal grant program to increase sup-
port for comprehensive services paired 
with housing to address our Nation’s 
current homelessness crisis. 
As we have seen with the growing di-
versity of our homeless populations— 
families with children, veterans, indi-
viduals with mental health conditions 
and struggling with addiction, people 
who simply could not keep up with in-
creases in rent—our Nation’s homeless-
ness crisis is not going to simply re-
solve itself on its own. 
According to the most recent data 
available from the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, there 
are more than 580,000 homeless individ-
uals and families in the United States. 
More than 25 percent of this population 
is in California, with approximately 
161,548 homeless people sleeping on the 
streets on any given night. 
In a Nation as prosperous as ours, we 
can and we must do better, especially 
as we address this crisis in the after-
math of the coronavirus pandemic. Our 
city, County, State, and Federal gov-
ernments 
must 
work 
hand-in-hand 
with the non-profit and private sectors 
to establish collaborative efforts to 
significantly address the issue of home-
lessness. 
The good news is that we have seen a 
model that works: supportive housing, 
which helps meet homeless individuals 
and families where they are. This ap-
proach can help stabilize an individual 
or family and change their life. Sup-
portive services such as mental and 
physical health care, substance abuse

treatment, education and job training, 
and life skills such as financial literacy 
are critical components. Paired with 
intensive case management, supportive 
housing models make a difference. 
One success story is the Downtown 
Women’s Center in Los Angeles. This 
shelter allows homeless and formerly 
homeless women to transform their 
lives through a combination of perma-
nent, supportive housing and workforce 
development. This would not be pos-
sible without the Center’s partnerships 
with the City of Los Angeles, the Los 
Angeles County Department of Health, 
and other critical stakeholders. I’ve 
visited the Center and encourage my 
colleagues to do the same to see why 
this model works. 
It is imperative that we support 
State and local efforts, as well as non-
profit service providers, as they work 
to get people into housing to both miti-
gate the spread of the coronavirus and 
address their long-term needs. 
Without a doubt, it will take a sig-
nificant investment to solve the cur-
rent homelessness crisis. That is why I 
am introducing the ‘‘Fighting Home-
lessness with Services and Housing 
Act,’’ which would authorize a new 
Federal funding stream of $1 billion per 
year, subject to annual appropriations. 
Grantees must serve individuals or 
families who are homeless or at risk of 
becoming homeless by providing hous-
ing paired with a comprehensive set of 
services and must provide a 25 percent 
match for any Federal funds received. 
Because each individual and every 
community is unique, the grant pro-
gram created by this bill would be 
flexible in order to work in any region 
or for any homeless population. 
This bill supports the great work al-
ready being done across the Country, 
allowing local governmental entities 
and non-profit organizations to expand 
their capacity and ensure a greater 
reach by putting Federal dollars where 
they will make the most effective im-
pact. 
This legislation is supported by a 
wide coalition of local governments, 
housing, health, and child welfare orga-
nizations, including the Mayors and 
CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment, Na-
tional Alliance to End Homelessness, 
Corporation for Supportive Housing, 
National Association of Counties, Na-
tional League of Cities, National Low 
Income Housing Coalition, and the 
NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social 
Justice. 
I hope my colleagues will join us in 
supporting the bill and moving it 
through the Senate, especially as we 
continue to contend with the increase 
in homelessness amid the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 2361. A bill to reauthorize the 
budget-neutral demonstration program 
for energy and water conservation at 
multifamily residential units, to estab-
lish a green retrofit program, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
joining Senator COLLINS in introducing 
the Green Retrofits Act of 2021, which 
seeks to boost energy efficiency in 
multifamily residential homes across 
the Nation. 
The legislation would accomplish 
this goal through two complimentary 
paths. First, the bill would authorize a 
public-private partnership program to 
make energy efficiency upgrades to 
properties currently receiving assist-
ance from the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD). Sec-
ond, it would direct the Secretary of 
HUD to create a program to distribute 
grants and loans for energy efficiency 
and home health upgrades in multi-
family homes. 
One of the most important invest-
ments we can make for our environ-
ment and our economy is in energy ef-
ficiency. Indeed, building a cleaner, 
more efficient energy system will in-
crease America’s global competitive-
ness, support job growth, and save fam-
ilies and businesses money through re-
duced energy consumption—all while 
reducing our carbon footprint. Further, 
investments in efficiency can be under-
taken quickly and provide immediate 
benefits. 
According to the U.S. Energy Infor-
mation Association, more than half of 
energy consumption in U.S. households 
is for two basic needs: heating and 
cooling. As our constituents in Maine 
and Rhode Island know all too well, 
these bills can get quite high during 
New England winters, and no one 
should be forced to choose between 
staying warm in the winter and buying 
groceries and medicine for their fami-
lies. Improving the efficiency of build-
ing components such as heating, cool-
ing, and lighting systems will help 
households lower their energy bills, re-
duce health and safety risks, and im-
prove the quality of life for residents. 
Our legislation is supported nation-
ally by the National Center for Healthy 
Housing, and in my state by the Rhode 
Island Office of Energy Resources and 
Rhode Island Housing. These state 
agencies have both made significant 
strides in clean energy and energy effi-
ciency policy and I am glad this legis-
lation will provide more resources to 
bolster those efforts. 
With our economy still recovering 
from the pandemic, and the threat of 
climate change continuing to mount, it 
is more important than ever that we 
take steps to reduce costs for American 
families and decrease energy consump-
tion. 
I urge our colleagues to join us in 
supporting this commonsense legisla-
tion. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and 
Ms. DUCKWORTH): 
S. 2362. A bill to require rulemaking

PORTING THE PEOPLE OF CUBA 
IN THEIR DEMANDS FOR FREE-
DOM AND THE FULFILLMENT OF 
BASIC NEEDS AND CONDEMNING 
THE 
COMMUNIST 
REGIME 
IN 
CUBA 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. MCCON-

BLUNT, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. RISCH, Mr. 
INHOFE, and Mrs. HYDE-SMITH) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 303 
Whereas, on July 11, 2021, thousands of peo-
ple in Cuba raised their voices against so-
cialism, tyranny, and oppression; 
Whereas the Cuban people, tired of living 
under a brutal dictatorship, peacefully pro-
tested 
against 
the 
Communist 
regime 
throughout Cuba, from major cities such as 
Havana, Santiago, and Santa Clara to small 
towns and villages; 
Whereas protesters have assembled at the 
headquarters of the Communist Party of 
Cuba chanting, ‘‘Cuba isn’t yours!’’, ‘‘We are 
not afraid!’’, ‘‘Freedom!’’, and ‘‘Homeland 
and Life’’; 
Whereas these protests are only the latest 
in the Cuban people’s long struggle for free-
dom, which has included— 
(1) the Christian Liberation Movement, 
which has advocated for political change in 
Cuba since 1987; 
(2) the 1994 Maleconazo uprising in Havana, 
during which thousands of protesters rose up 
against the disastrous economic policies of 
the Communist regime in Cuba; 
(3) the Varela Project, which, in 1998, pro-
posed a law advocating for democratic polit-
ical reforms within Cuba; 
(4) the Ladies in White movement, founded 
in 2003 by the wives and relatives of those 
imprisoned by the regime; and 
(5) the San Isidro Movement, which was 
formed by artists, journalists, and academics 
in 2018 to protest the restrictions imposed by 
the Communist regime in Cuba on the Cuban 
people’s right to free expression; 
Whereas, since 1959, the Communist regime 
in Cuba has repressed political and economic 
freedoms, including by— 
(1) preventing Cubans from owning private 
property and using property stolen from 
Cuban-Americans, many of whom are now 
United States citizens; 
(2) forcing Cubans employed at foreign 
firms to register with a state employment 
agency that confiscates the bulk of their 
earnings; and 
(3) restricting the access of the Cuban peo-
ple to the internet by using equipment and 
systems produced and installed by entities 
controlled by the Chinese Communist Party; 
Whereas the Communist regime in Cuba 
has not acted to preserve the lives and well- 
being of the Cuban people during the COVID– 
19 pandemic and left Cubans in dire need of 
food, medicine, and other basic necessities; 
Whereas the Communist Party of Cuba has 
for years sought to silence those it considers 
its political opponents through the use of po-
lice harassment, forced detainment, and tor-
ture, including— 
(1) dismissing and disparaging Oswaldo 
Paya, founder of the Christian Liberation 
Movement, and obstructing a credible inves-
tigation into the questionable circumstances 
of his death in a car crash in 2012; 
(2) imprisoning 75 dissidents, journalists, 
and human rights advocates during the 
‘‘Black Spring’’ in Cuba in 2003; 
(3) imprisoning Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, 
founder of the Patriotic Union of Cuba 
(UNPACU); 
(4) arresting journalist Camila Acosta in 
March 2021 for sharing information on 
Facebook; 
(5) detaining Ivan Hernandez Carrillo, an 
independent labor union leader, multiple 
times; 
(6) 
imprisoning 
journalist 
Roberto 
Quinones Haces; and 
(7) detaining the leaders of the San Isidro 
Movement, including Luis Manuel Otero 
Alcantara, Esteban Lazaro Rodriguez Lopez, 
Maykel Osorbo, and many others; 
Whereas the Communist regime in Cuba 
has been responsible for numerous atrocities 
against those that stood up for the rights of 
the Cuban people, including the extrajudicial 
assassinations of innocent civilians and ac-
tivists by firing squad and other brutal 
methods, such as during the Tugboat Mas-
sacre of 1994 and the shoot-down of the 
Brothers to the Rescue aircraft in 1996; 
Whereas the Communist regime in Cuba is 
taking steps to silence protesters and their 
message by shutting down internet access 
throughout Cuba, including by seizing and 
assaulting photographer Ramon Espinosa; 
Whereas the Communist regime in Cuba 
has already taken steps to violently suppress 
protests, including deploying heavily armed 
troops and tear gas to disperse protesters; 
Whereas hundreds of Cubans have been 
wounded by that use of violence by the Com-
munist regime in Cuba, and 67 individuals 
have been arrested by the regime; 
Whereas Miguel Diaz-Canel has openly 
called for bloodshed to quell the protests by 
calling 
on 
‘‘revolutionary’’ 
citizens 
to 
‘‘battl[e] in the streets’’; 
Whereas the Communist regime in Cuba 
has for years resisted the efforts of the 
United States and its allies to bring freedom 
to Cuba, including by— 
(1) threatening the mass deportation of 
people in order to destabilize local govern-
ment services in the United States; 
(2) harboring terrorists and fugitives from 
the United States wanted for committing 
violent crimes in the United States; and 
(3) jamming the radio broadcasts of Radio 
and TV Marti, which provide critical infor-
mation on the outside world to the Cuban 
people; and 
Whereas, since 1959, the United States has 
stood steadfastly in support of the freedom 
of the Cuban people: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for the people of Cuba 
on their courageous efforts to advance free-
dom and democracy in Cuba; 
(2) calls on Cuban security forces to re-
spect the fundamental rights of the Cuban 
people to peacefully protest while raising 
their voices and demanding ‘‘Libertad’’; 
(3) calls on the Communist regime in Cuba 
to immediately release all political prisoners 
and calls for the end of acts of repression and 
arbitrary imprisonment of members of the 
opposition, artists, and journalists; 
(4) calls on the Ministry of the Interior and 
the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces to refrain from physical violence and 
any other acts of repression against the peo-
ple of Cuba; 
(5) urges the European Union and Latin 
American and Caribbean allies— 
(A) to express their solidarity with all the 
Cuban people; 
(B) to speak out against the repression of 
the freedom-loving people of Cuba; 
(C) to condemn acts of violence against the 
Cuban people by the military and security 
forces of Cuba; and 
(D) to cease cooperation with the mur-
derous and corrupt Communist regime in 
Cuba; 
(6) urges President Biden to coordinate an 
international effort through— 
(A) calling a meeting of the United Nations 
Security Council; 
(B) engaging the European Union and the 
Organization of American States (OAS) to 
condemn the oppression of the Cuban people 
by the Communist regime in Cuba; and 
(C) leading the effort to impose multilat-
eral sanctions on the regime and against 
those violating the human rights of the pro-
testers; and 
(7) encourages President Biden and the 
Secretary of State to publicly condemn the 
violence, 
arbitrary 
arrests, 
persecution, 
threats, and intimidation against the people 
of Cuba.

SENATE RESOLUTION 304—DESIG-
NATING JULY 2021 AS ‘‘PLASTIC 
POLLUTION ACTION MONTH’’ 
Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 304 
Whereas plastic pollution represents a 
global threat that will require individual and 
collective action, both nationally and inter-
nationally, to address; 
Whereas, since the 1950s, over 8,000,000,000 
tons of plastic have been produced world-
wide; 
Whereas, in the United States— 
(1) just 9 percent of plastic waste is sorted 
for recycling; and 
(2) less than 3 percent of plastic waste is 
recycled into a similar quality product; 
Whereas a recent study found that, despite 
the United States only accounting for 4 per-
cent of the global population in 2016, in that 
same year the United States— 
(1) generated 17 percent of all plastic 
waste; and 
(2) ranked third among all countries con-
tributing to coastal plastic pollution; 
Whereas single-use plastics account for at 
least 40 percent of the plastic produced every 
year; 
Whereas over 12,000,000 tons of plastic 
waste enter the ocean every year from land- 
based sources alone; 
Whereas, if no action is taken, the flow of 
plastics into the ocean is expected to triple 
by 2040; 
Whereas studies estimate that there are 
between 15,000,000,000,000 and 51,000,000,000,000 
pieces of plastic in the oceans; 
Whereas, globally, 100,000 marine mammals 
die every year as a result of plastic pollu-
tion; 
Whereas plastics, and associated chemicals 
of plastics, directly impact human health; 
Whereas studies suggest that, every week, 
humans swallow the amount of plastic that 
is in a credit card; 
Whereas taking action to reduce plastic 
use, collect and clean up litter, and reuse 
and recycle more plastics will lead to less 
plastic pollution;

July 15, 2021 
Whereas, every July, people challenge 
themselves to reduce their plastic footprint 
through ‘‘Plastics Free July’’; 
Whereas, during the International Coastal 
Cleanup in 2020, nearly 950,000 people across 
the globe cleaned up over 10,000 tons of plas-
tic from beaches; 
Whereas switching to reusable items in-
stead of single-use items can prevent waste, 
save water, and reduce litter; and 
Whereas July 2021 is an appropriate month 
to designate as Plastic Pollution Action 
Month to recommit to taking action, indi-
vidually and as a country, to reduce plastic 
pollution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 2021 as ‘‘Plastic Pollu-
tion Action Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the dangers to human health 
and the environment posed by plastic pollu-
tion; and 
(3) encourages all individuals in the United 
States to protect, conserve, maintain, and 
rebuild the environment by responsibly par-
ticipating in activities to reduce plastic pol-
lution in July 2021 and year-round.

FOR GREATER ACCESS TO MUSIC 
EDUCATION 
FOR

CAN-AMERICAN 
MUSIC 
APPRE-
CIATION MONTH 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. DUR-
BIN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. BROWN, and 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 305 
Whereas spirituals, ragtime, blues, jazz, 
gospel, classical composition, and countless 
other categories of music have been created 
or enhanced by African Americans and are 
etched into the history and culture of the 
United States; 
Whereas the first Africans transported to 
the United States came from a variety of 
ethnic groups with a long history of distinct 
and cultivated musical traditions, brought 
musical instruments with them, and built 
new musical instruments in the United 
States; 
Whereas spirituals were a distinct response 
to the conditions of African slavery in the 
United States and expressed the longing of 
slaves for spiritual and bodily freedom, for 
safety from harm and evil, and for relief 
from the hardships of slavery; 
Whereas jazz, arguably the most creative 
and complex music that the United States 
has produced, combines the musical tradi-
tions of African Americans in New Orleans 
with the creative flexibility of blues music; 
Whereas masterful trumpeters Louis Arm-
strong and Miles Davis achieved national 
and international recognition with the suc-
cess of ‘‘West End Blues’’ by Louis Arm-
strong in the 1920s and ‘‘So What’’ by Miles 
Davis in the late 1950s; 
Whereas Thomas Dorsey, the father of gos-
pel music, used his composing talents to 
merge sacred and secular styles that created 
a revolution in music; 
Whereas talented jazz pianist and vocalist 
Nathaniel Adams Coles recorded more than 
150 singles and sold more than 50,000,000 
records; 
Whereas the talent of Ella Fitzgerald, a 
winner of 13 Grammys, is epitomized by a 
rendition of ‘‘Summertime’’, a bluesy record 
accompanied by melodic vocals; 
Whereas Natalie Cole, the daughter of Na-
thaniel Adams Coles, achieved musical suc-
cess in the mid-1970s as a rhythm and blues 
artist with the hits ‘‘This Will Be’’ and ‘‘Un-
forgettable’’; 
Whereas, in the 1940s, bebop evolved 
through jam sessions, which included trum-
peter Dizzy Gillespie and the alto saxo-
phonist Charlie Parker, that were held at 
clubs in Harlem, New York, such as Minton’s 
Playhouse; 
Whereas earlier classical singers such as 
Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, one of the first 
widely known African-American vocalists, 
and other early African-American singing 
pioneers, including Nellie Mitchell Brown, 
Marie Selika Williams, Rachel Walker Tur-
ner, Marian Anderson, and Flora Batson Ber-
gen, paved the way for the female African- 
American concert singers who have achieved 
great popularity during the last 50 years; 
Whereas the term ‘‘rhythm and blues’’ 
originated in the late 1940s as a way to de-
scribe recordings marketed to African Amer-
icans and replaced the term ‘‘race music’’; 
Whereas lyrical themes in rhythm and 
blues often encapsulate the African-Amer-
ican experience of pain, the quest for free-
dom, joy, triumphs and failures, relation-
ships, economics, and aspiration and were 
popularized by artists such as Ray Charles, 
Ruth Brown, Etta James, and Otis Redding; 
Whereas soul music originated in the Afri-
can-American community in the late 1950s 
and early 1960s, combines elements of Afri-
can-American gospel music, rhythm and 
blues, and jazz, and was popularized by art-
ists such as Aretha Franklin, James Brown, 
Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Bill Withers, and 
Jackie Wilson; 
Whereas Motown, founded as a record label 
in 1959, evolved into a distinctive style 
known for the ‘‘Motown Sound’’, a blend of 
pop and soul musical stylings made popular 
by prominent Black artists such as Marvin 
Gaye, James Mason, and Mary Wells; 
Whereas, in the early 1970s, the musical 
style of disco emerged and was popularized 
by programs such as Soul Train and by art-
ists such as Donna Summer; 
Whereas reggae is a genre of music that 
originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s and 
incorporates some of the musical elements of 
rhythm and blues, jazz, mento, calypso, and 
African music, and was popularized by art-
ists such as Bob Marley; 
Whereas rock and roll was developed from 
African-American musical styles such as 
gospel and rhythm and blues and was popu-
larized by artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo 
Diddley, Little Richard, and Jimi Hendrix; 
Whereas rap, arguably the most complex 
and influential form of hip-hop culture, com-
bines blues, jazz, and soul and elements of 
the African-American musical tradition with 
Caribbean calypso, dub, and dance hall 
reggae; 
Whereas the development and popularity of 
old-style rap combined confident beats with 
wordplay and storytelling, highlighting the 
struggle of African-American youth growing 
up in underresourced neighborhoods; 
Whereas contemporary rhythm and blues, 
which originated in the late 1970s and com-
bines elements of pop, rhythm and blues, 
soul, funk, hip hop, gospel, and electronic 
dance music, was popularized by artists such 
as Whitney Houston and Aaliyah; 
Whereas Prince Rogers Nelson, who was 
known for electric performances and a wide 
vocal range, pioneered music that integrated 
a wide variety of styles, including funk, 
rock, contemporary rhythm and blues, new 
wave, soul, psychedelia, and pop; 
Whereas a recent study by the Department 
of Education found that only 28 percent of 
African-American students receive any kind 
of arts education; 
Whereas African-American students scored 
the lowest of all ethnicities in the most re-
cent National Assessment for Educational 
Progress arts assessment; 
Whereas students who are eligible for the 
school lunch program established under the 
Richard B. Russell National School Lunch 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) have significantly 
lower scores on the music portion of the Na-
tional Assessment for Educational Progress 
arts assessment than students who are ineli-
gible for that program, which suggests that 
students in low-income families are dis-
advantaged in the subject of music; 
Whereas a recent study found that— 
(1) nearly 2⁄3 of music ensemble students 
were White and middle class, and only 15 per-
cent of those students were African-Amer-
ican; and 
(2) only 7 percent of music teacher licen-
sure candidates were African American; and 
Whereas students of color face many bar-
riers to accessing music education and train-
ing, especially students in large urban public 
schools: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes— 
(A) the contributions of African Americans 
to the musical heritage of the United States; 
(B) the wide array of talented and popular 
African-American 
musical 
artists, 
com-
posers, songwriters, and musicians who are 
underrecognized for contributions to music; 
(C) the achievements, talent, and hard 
work of African-American pioneer artists 
and the obstacles that those artists over-
came to gain recognition; 
(D) the need for African-American students 
to have greater access to, and participation 
in, music education in schools across the 
United States; and 
(E) Black History Month and African- 
American Music Appreciation Month as an 
important time— 
(i) to celebrate the impact of the African- 
American musical heritage on the musical 
heritage of the United States; and 
(ii) to encourage greater access to music 
education so that the next generation may 
continue to greatly contribute to the musi-
cal heritage of the United States; and 
(2) designates June 2021 as ‘‘African-Amer-
ican Music Appreciation Month’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4932 
July 15, 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and the distinguished 
Republican leader, Mr. MCCONNELL, I 
send to the desk a resolution author-
izing representation by the Senate 
Legal Counsel and ask for its imme-
diate consideration. 
Mr. President, this resolution con-
cerns a lawsuit filed in Federal court in 
Florida that names a range of local, 
State, and Federal defendants, includ-
ing Senator RUBIO. Plaintiff’s sole alle-
gation against Senator RUBIO is that he 
did not respond to plaintiff’s request to 
introduce 
legislation 
that 
plaintiff 
urges him to present to Congress. 
Plaintiff’s claims against the Senator 
based on this allegation are subject to 
dismissal on jurisdictional grounds and 
for failure to state a claim. This reso-
lution would authorize the Senate 
Legal Counsel to represent Senator 
RUBIO in order to seek dismissal of the 
claims against him. 
f

f 
CUBA 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to discuss the protests we have 
seen erupt in Cuba over the past sev-
eral days. 
On Sunday, shouts of ‘‘libertad!’’— 
freedom!—were heard in dozens of cit-
ies and towns all over Cuba as people 
took to the streets to protest the com-
munist government that has had a 
stranglehold on that nation for 62 
years. 
This socialist regime has tortured, 
killed, silenced, denied freedom, and 
driven into exile generations of Cu-
bans, forcing many, including my fam-
ily, to flee or to be murdered. It has 
cut off Cuba from the rest of the world. 
It has destroyed its economy so that, 
today, Cubans stand in long lines for 
food, for medicine, for basic supplies. 
They endure energy blackouts, and 
government officials can shut off their 
censored internet service on a whim— 
as they did on Sunday when the regime 
panicked about the protests. 
This battle for freedom is personal to 
me. When Fulgencio Batista staged a 
coup in Cuba and became a brutal dic-
tator in the 1950s, my father fought 
against his regime. My dad was impris-
oned and tortured. His captors broke 
his nose and bashed in his front teeth 
so they were dangling from his mouth. 
My father fled Cuba—the country he 
had fought for and had been brutalized 
for trying to save—and in 1957, my fa-
ther came to the United States. He 
went to Texas with $100 sewn into his 
underwear. He had nothing. He at-
tended the University of Texas on a 
student visa and got a job washing 
dishes, making 50 cents an hour. 
In the summer of 1959, soon after Cas-
tro had taken over Cuba, my father re-
turned to visit his family, and he was 
horrified by what he saw. It quickly be-
came evident that Castro was even 
worse than Batista had been. My fa-
ther’s sister, my tia Sonia, was still 
there, and she became part of the coun-
terrevolution against Castro. Like her 
brother, my tia Sonia was thrown in 
prison, and she was tortured by Cas-
tro’s goons. 
In growing up, my cousin Bibi and I 
used to sit at the feet of my dad and 
my tia Sonia and hear stories about 
their fight for freedom, hear their sto-
ries about the battling in Cuba just 
like the heroic protesters on the 
streets are doing today. The freedom of 
America was the dream that allowed 
them to endure the brutality of Cuba. 
America was and is a beacon of hope 
for all of those who, like them, have 
endured oppression, and that is why we 
saw so many protesters in Cuba who 
were flying American flags on Sun-
day—because the American flag is a 
symbol of hope in Havana, in Hong 
Kong, and all across the globe. 
America must respond. Over the past 
few days, the world has seen that the 
American people stand squarely with 
the men and women of Cuba in their 
noble fight for liberty. 
Worryingly, however, the Biden ad-
ministration 
has 
stopped 
short 
of 
strong, clear support for the brave pro-
testers who are marching in the street, 
and it has been reluctant to issue clear 
and unequivocal condemnation for the 
communist dictatorship that oppresses 
those people. In statement after state-
ment, as protesters have swept into the 
streets—literally risking their lives to 
stand for freedom—administration offi-
cials have issued lukewarm and guard-
ed statements. 
After being shamed into finally tak-
ing stronger positions, President Biden 
finally put out a statement, saying 
that the protesters were exercising 
their right to peaceful assembly, but 
even that is wrong. In Cuba, they have 
no right to peaceful assembly because 
the Cuban dictatorship is out there ar-
resting the protesters right now. It is 
out there beating the protesters right 
now. It is out there imprisoning the 
protesters right now. They are speak-
ing with great courage, and the com-
munist dictatorship is doing every-
thing it can to silence what they are 
saying. 
The Biden administration has also 
said the protests are about COVID–19 
vaccines. That, unfortunately, doesn’t 
even pass the laugh test. Just this 
week, the White House Press Secretary 
said 
the 
protests 
were 
about 
misadministration 
in 
Cuba, 
mis-
management. Well, the last I checked, 
the protesters in the streets weren’t 
chanting: ‘‘Manage better!’’ They were 
chanting: ‘‘Libertad!’’—freedom! They 
were chanting: ‘‘Down with the dicta-
torship!’’ 
America has a unique role in the 
world—a role to provide leadership, a 
role to speak the truth—and at times 
of inflection, at times when people are 
risking their lives for freedom, the 
leadership of America matters. 
Here is what President Biden needs 
to say to the Cuban people: To the 
Cuban people, we stand with you. To 
the Cuban people, you are right that 
you have a right to liberty; you have a 
right to speech; you have a right to 
worship; you have a right to live your 
lives and raise your children and be 
free of oppression and torture and mur-
der. 
President Biden needs to go on to 
say: The communist dictatorship that 
oppresses you is evil—period, full stop. 
In my Senate office, I have a large 
painting of President Ronald Reagan 
when he was standing in front of the 
Brandenburg Gate. Above the gate, in 
the style of the graffiti that was on the 
Berlin Wall, are the words: ‘‘Mr. Gorba-
chev, tear down this wall.’’ American 
leadership matters, and it is heard in 
the darkest recesses. 
Some years ago, I sat down with 
Natan Sharansky, the famed Soviet 
dissident. He and I sat down together 
in Jerusalem, and he told me, when he 
was in a gulag in the Soviet Union, 
that prisoners would pass notes from 
cell to cell: Did you hear what Reagan 
said? ‘‘Evil empire,’’ ‘‘ash heap of his-
tory,’’ ‘‘tear down this wall.’’ 
Presidential silence is heard in Cuba, 
and Presidential clarity is heard in 
Cuba. 
I want to close by reading a text that 
I got this week from my mom. My 
mom and our family are in commu-
nication with family friends still in 
Cuba.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4934 
July 15, 2021 
Here is what a close friend of the 
family said: Things are much more se-
rious than what is reported on TV. This 
friend of the family described that she 
has no food, which is the same for al-
most everyone. Yesterday, she had a 
bowl of thin soup—nothing more. She 
was asking for help for the first time. 
There is no way to get money to Cuba. 
Banks are closed. Five protesters were 
killed in Santiago. Radio stations are 
being taken over by protesters. The 
internet is shut down so there is no fur-
ther 
contact 
available. 
Matanzas, 
where my father was born, is a hotspot 
for COVID, and it sounds as though 
desperate times are generating des-
perate measures. 
To the people of Cuba, I want you to 
know your message is being heard; 
your bravery is being seen; and it is 
worth it. This is potentially an inflec-
tion point, and America should stand 
up and speak boldly on the side of free-
dom. 
There is a reason those protesters 
carry our flags. There is a reason they 
look to America as a beacon of hope 
and freedom across the globe. 
To the people of Cuba, we stand with 
you. You have a right to be free, and 
your courage is inspiring. We are in-
spired by you. As to the evil thugs who 
are on the street, brutalizing you, they, 
too, will end up in the ash heap of his-
tory. The oppression in Cuba will fall, 
and we will, once again, see ‘‘una cuba 
libre’’—a free Cuba—thanks to the 
courage and heroism of the Cubans in 
the street. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
f 
BUDGET 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, for far 
too long, the Federal Government has 
simply been spending and borrowing 
far more money than it should. It has 
been borrowing and spending money 
that it doesn’t have. Now, for individ-
uals, for businesses, even for States 
and local governments, this kind of 
conduct is not just inadvisable, which 
it clearly is, but it is also impossible. I 
mean, sure, people can get away with it 
for a short period of time, but the laws 
of mathematics are very quickly able 
to catch up with them so that they 
can’t do it. 
The Federal Government is unique in 
this regard. There is something about 
the size of the U.S. economy, coupled 
with the status of the U.S. dollar as the 
world’s reserve currency—a combina-
tion of factors—that has given the Fed-
eral Government this ability that is 
somewhat unique, you see, because it 
has access to essentially what amounts 
to a printing press in Washington, DC, 
that prints out more and more money 
with reckless abandon, more and more 
money in a way that would be impos-
sible not just for any individual, any 
family, any business, or any nonprofit 
but also that most governments in the 
United States and the world could 
never dream of. Yet this government 
has been able to get away with it be-
cause of these unique factors and 
unique features that exist here. So the 
Federal Government just spends more 
money as if the laws of mathematics 
did not apply. 
Now, in recent history, the Federal 
Government has been spending some-
thing in the range of about $4 trillion a 
year. Tragically—this is a massive sum 
of money, but, tragically, that has rep-
resented about $1 trillion a year more 
than we bring in. So we have added to 
our debt at a rate of about $1 trillion a 
year. 
This is stunning, especially when you 
consider the fact that we have been at 
the top of an economic cycle over the 
last few years. We have not been in a 
state of a recession and we were spend-
ing this money. Even with a booming 
economy, we weren’t able to bring our 
outlays down to match our revenue 
that was coming into the Federal Gov-
ernment. So it has been about $4 tril-
lion, more or less, over the last few 
years. 
But last year, with COVID–19, we 
spent a total of $6.6 trillion. That in-
cludes our COVID relief packages. This 
is an enormous volume of new, addi-
tional borrowed money on top of the 
trillion dollars a year or so that we 
were already spending, already bor-
rowing; that we were already deciding 
to spend above and beyond what our 
revenues would allow us to spend. 
And then now the Democrats have 
announced a plan to spend another $3.5 
trillion just this week. And on top of 
that, there is another trillion-dollar in-
frastructure package in the works. And 
earlier this year, there was a $1.9 tril-
lion package that was passed. And so 
all of this is occurring in a year when 
we already have a staggering $28 tril-
lion debt. 
The reality is that the Federal Gov-
ernment does not itself feel the con-
sequences of this; the people do. In 
other words, the Federal Government 
could get away with it because of this 
unique status that we have, the dollar 
being the world’s reserve currency, the 
size of the U.S. economy. It has gotten 
away with it without adverse con-
sequences that the Federal Govern-
ment and its officers themselves feel 
directly. 
It 
does, 
however, 
produce 
con-
sequences. They are felt by the people. 
Now, we have known for a long time 
that this was presenting something of 
a threat to future generations; some-
thing that we knew would really come 
to haunt our children and our grand-
children and their children after them. 
We have always known this. But at the 
rate when we have accelerated our 
massive deficit spending and the degree 
to which we have extended it, this is no 
longer just a problem for the future. 
This, you see, is affecting us right now. 
For a long time, I and others have 
talked about how it would affect our 
children and our grandchildren. And all 
this is still real—be a very real con-
sequence. They will still have to face 
that debt. They will still have to pay it 
back. It will still be unpleasant, but 
not just in the future. They are caught 
up with us already. 
The problem is no longer generations 
away. It has now reached its hand into 
our wallets, into our families, and into 
our day-to-day lives. 
So what happens when too many dol-
lars are produced out of thin air, when 
we just print more money? I mean, I 
know there is an intermediate step 
there. 
Technically, 
it 
is 
borrowed 
money. The money that we don’t have 
isn’t just printed. It is—it is borrowed 
as the U.S. Treasury bills are sold. And 
we borrow that money knowing that 
we are going to have to pay it back 
later. But it has the effect of just 
printing more money. 
When we just print more money, 
those dollars, which have now multi-
plied, they are still chasing, more or 
less, the same quantity of goods. And 
so what that means is that the same 
quantity of goods with more dollars re-
sults in each of those goods being able 
to command a higher price—just infla-
tion. 
When you dump more money into the 
economy, it doesn’t make things easier 
for people; it just raises the cost. 
Now, this hurts poor and middle-class 
Americans especially hard. It hurts es-
pecially hard those who are living on a 
fixed income, on a fixed wage or a fixed 
salary; those who aren’t wealthy and 
don’t have a large amount of money 
that they can use to invest to make 
sure that, as price inflation occurs, 
maybe they can make some money off 
of it too. This hurts the poor and mid-
dle-class American families the most, 
you see, because they have still got the 
same amount of money to spend, but 
everything is more costly. This isn’t 
fair to them. 
It is causing—our own government is 
causing the increase in cost that hard-
working 
families 
across 
Utah 
and 
throughout America are already feel-
ing. Every day, as a result, it is getting 
harder to fill cupboards and refrig-
erators and bellies and gas tanks. 
Every day, it is getting more expensive 
to drive to work or to the doctor’s of-
fice or to see your family and friends. 
From the price of housing to cars, to 
food, we are seeing the general level of 
inflation increasing at a higher rate 
than we have seen in many, many 
years. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
has produced data—the data for May 
that saw the biggest 12-month con-
sumer price index increase in 13 years. 
This follows the April number, which 
was 4.2 percent higher than April of 
last year. 
The data from May also showed that 
gasoline prices are up over 50 percent 
from last year; that used vehicles are, 
on average, costing 30 percent more 
over last year; and that food bought 
outside the home has seen a jump of 4 
percent. Chicken prices are soaring.

trading at $2 a pound compared to the 
$1.30 a pound that it averaged over the 
last decade. 
Some packages of diapers that cost 
about $25 as recently as last year now 
cost around $40, and there are fewer 
diapers inside the package, further em-
phasizing the nature of the problem. 
By the way, these higher prices dis-
proportionately impact the poor and 
middle class, who don’t have the lux-
ury of investing their income and don’t 
have the luxury of having that added 
buffer. 
And we in Utah are feeling the pinch. 
According to a recent survey, 85 per-
cent of Utahans are worried about in-
flation. 
So what does this mean? Well, sadly, 
it means hard choices are in front of 
us; hard choices that we are going to 
have to face sooner than we might 
wish, but we will have to face them 
whether we want to or not. 
This means that we will have to say 
no to some hard things; things that— 
while not necessarily bad in and of 
themselves, things that might be good; 
things that others are incorrectly pre-
senting as necessary and affordable 
when they are not. But we have to say 
no to them so that we can say yes to 
what is necessary. 
So what is truly necessary? Well, 
being able to buy groceries and put 
food on the table; being able to pay 
your rent or your mortgage; being able 
to turn on the heat or the air-condi-
tioning in your home; being able to buy 
gasoline to drive to work, to the doc-
tor, or to take your kids to school; 
being able to pay for school clothes and 
field-trip fees, not to mention baseball 
uniforms and soccer cleats. 
And you can forget about that trip to 
see that relative you haven’t been able 
to embrace in 16 months. 
These are all things that are nec-
essary and they are all things that 
have one thing in common. They are 
all being jeopardized because of the 
government’s reckless spending and 
acting outside of its proper scope. 
This, you see, creates a vicious cycle. 
It is a cycle that is all too convenient 
for many in government, who are mak-
ing the decisions. 
And who makes the decisions ulti-
mately? Well, that is Congress—the 
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives. You see, under our constitu-
tional system, you can’t spend any 
money through the Treasury of the 
United States without Congress au-
thorizing it, without Congress appro-
priating it. So we have to do all of this 
by law, and it ultimately comes down 
to us. 
That dynamic I described earlier of 
an effective printing press that, you 
know—well, it is a little more com-
plicated than that. It is effectively a 
case that we just print more money, 
compounded by the fact that, cul-
turally, within the Congress of the 
United States—among Republicans and 
Democrats alike, among Senators and 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives alike—we have grown too accus-
tomed to a pattern, a dangerous pat-
tern, that is good for the political 
class, maybe favorable in some ways 
for a small handful of elected politi-
cians, but bad for everyone else. 
You see, the way it works in this 
town, the way the news media tends to 
report on these things, you tend to get 
praised if you vote yes. There is always 
someone you can point to who benefits 
from the bill that gets passed from the 
money that gets spent. 
Very often does anyone get anything 
but criticism for voting against those 
things, even if, even though, even when 
by their very nature those things tend 
to impoverish, albeit in increments, in-
crements that are sometimes difficult 
to observe at any given moment, to 
purchasing power of poor and middle- 
class Americans. 
So what this mean is, in many ways, 
we are trading one thing for another. 
We are trading the ability to be praised 
as an elected official, an elected politi-
cian one day in order to spend money. 
You get praised for that, but poor and 
middle-class Americans are paying the 
price. 
For a long time we have been able to 
sweep this under the rug. For a long 
time Washington has avoided getting 
blamed for this because it has been in-
cremental, it has been indirect, it has 
been something that is perhaps ex-
plainable in some cases through other 
mechanisms. 
Not 
everyone 
imme-
diately connects inflation to out-of- 
control spending decisions by elected 
Senators and congressmen. 
But we have ratcheted up the spend-
ing levels so much over the last year 
and a half. And, yes, this has been 
under the direction of Republicans and 
Democrats alike. We have turned that 
up so much, so quickly that people are 
feeling the effects more directly, more 
immediately, more unmistakably than 
ever before. And, yes, it is our fault be-
cause, yes, we have put our own polit-
ical convenience ahead of the interests 
of poor and middle-class Americans, 
and that is to our shame. That is to our 
shame especially if we don’t recognize 
that we are doing it and seek to correct 
it. 
When it comes to voting on large 
spending packages, there is this trend 
of politicians voting yes and being 
praised, and politicians voting no and 
being criticized. 
Look, it will be of little comfort to 
the poor and middle class of this coun-
try who feel the buying power of their 
seemingly dwindling paycheck shrink 
each week just so that politicians can 
vote yes on large spending packages for 
a short-term amount of praise and po-
litical gain. 
At times I have been accused of being 
a reflexive no vote on things that some 
of my colleagues are willing to explain 
away or justify or defend whole-
heartedly. But here is an important 
point that I would like to make: I vote 
no not by reflex but through reason. 
I vote no when I see how the con-
sequences will affect those I represent 
in real, everyday life, not just the in-
tended consequences of legislation that 
might indeed have a good goal and 
might indeed accomplish good things, 
but 
the 
unintended 
negative 
con-
sequences also. 
I vote no if it will mean saying yes to 
what 
really 
matters, 
what 
really 
counts for making everyday life better 
for Utahans and hardworking Ameri-
cans across the country. 
And I vote no so that Utahans can 
say yes to the things that they need, 
because if we don’t ever say no, we are 
hurting them. If we always say yes, we 
are putting them in a position of hav-
ing to say no to the things that matter 
most to them and to their children and 
their families. 
Look, 
this 
government’s 
reckless 
spending is notorious, but it is finally 
catching up with us. This problem ex-
ists because the Federal Government 
and the politicians in Washington, DC, 
work hand-in-hand with our central 
bank to spend enormous amounts of 
money that we simply do not have. 
This has been facilitated by so many 
who are so willing to call on it, even 
though it results in the dangerous ac-
cumulation of power and money in the 
hands of the few at the expense of the 
poor and middle class. 
We are feeling the consequences of 
these things right here and right now. 
It is up to us to take action, to pump 
the brakes and steer our government 
back in a fiscally responsible, sustain-
able, and sane direction. The con-
sequences will only get worse if we do 
not and if we do not do so very fast. 
I yield the floor.
