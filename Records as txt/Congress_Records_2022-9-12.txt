PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. Eternal God, who hears 
our prayers, we praise Your righteous 
Name. Lord, You are the God who lis-
tens even to our groans as we bring our 
requests to You. 
Lord, we thank You for the life and 
legacy of Queen Elizabeth II and re-
quest Your blessings upon King Charles 
III. Guide him with Your wisdom and 
keep him on the path of integrity. We 
also pray for our Senators. Sustain 
them with Your unfailing love, making 
Your way plain for them to follow. Pro-

for You have promised to be a shield 
for the godly. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion and resume consideration of the 
following nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Lara E. Montecalvo, of Rhode 
Island, to be United States Circuit 
Judge for the First Circuit. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate gavels back into session to 
consider more Federal judges, continue 
working to fund the government, and 
to find a path forward to protect mar-
riage equality and other critical issues. 
Later this afternoon, the Senate will 
vote on the confirmation of Judge Sal-
vador Mendoza to serve a lifetime ap-
pointment on the Ninth Circuit Court 
of Appeals. The child of Mexican immi-
grant farmworkers, Mr. Mendoza was 
the first Latino judge to ever serve in 
the Eastern District of Washington. 
And if confirmed today, he would be 
the first Latino from the State of 
Washington ever to sit on the Ninth 
Circuit. In 2014, the Senate confirmed 
Mr. Mendoza with an overwhelming bi-
partisan vote, 92 to 4. Today, it should 
be no different. 
If confirmed, Judge Mendoza’s ele-
vation will be significant for another 
reason. He would be the 80th, the 80th— 
8–0—judicial 
nomination 
confirmed 
under President Biden. That is more 
judges 
confirmed 
under 
President 
Biden than were confirmed by this 
point under President Trump, Presi-
dent Obama, and President Bush. It is 
something we Democrats are very 
proud of because the impact of these 
judges will last for years, if not dec-
ades. 
And we are by no means done. After 
Judge Mendoza is confirmed, we will 
turn to the nomination of Arianna 
Freeman to serve as circuit judge for

the Third Circuit. She would be the 
fourth circuit judge nominee we would 
consider since the beginning of this 
work period. 
Let me say that again. We are going 
to begin considering the fourth circuit 
court nominee since we returned from 
the August State work period. I said 
judges would be a priority, and this is 
what that looks like. 
And it is my intention, as majority 
leader, to keep the Senate focused on 
judges this week and beyond. Our fun-
damental rights and our democracy 
itself depend on it. 
RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT 
Madam President, now, on marriage, 
off the Senate floor, my colleagues 
continue to have good conversations on 
very important legislation to codify 
marriage equality into law. Far from 
being a theoretical exercise, codifying 
marriage equality would have a dra-
matic long-term impact on millions of 
people. 
At a time when our rights are under 
siege, it would be a much needed shield 
for scores of Americans at risk of dis-
crimination simply because of whom 
they love. 
For many of us in this Chamber—my-
self included—passing marriage equal-
ity would hit home in a very personal 
way. I want to thank my colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle—especially 
Senators 
BALDWIN, 
COLLINS, 
and 
SINEMA—for all the work they are 
doing to build support for marriage 
equality legislation. 
Over the past several months, I have 
given them the time and space they 
have requested to have these talks be-
cause I want their efforts to succeed. I 
know their work is not yet done, and I 
encourage them to keep going. I truly 
hope, for the sake of tens of millions of 
Americans, that there will be at least 
10 Republicans who will vote with us to 
pass this very important bill. 
We cannot forget that a mere decade 
ago—a mere decade ago—marriage dis-
crimination was the law in much of the 
country. While we are happy that 
America has made a lot of progress 
since then, we are not naive in think-
ing we can’t go backward. As we saw 
earlier this year, it took the Supreme 
Court just a few weeks to unravel dec-
ades of vital precedent on women’s 
rights, gun safety, and environmental 
protection. 
And, 
of 
course, 
Judge 
Thomas has opened the door for the 
Court to go even further backward 
when he is saying that cases like 
Obergefell, 
which 
protect 
marriage 
equality for now, should be revisited. 
So when some Republicans say: Oh, 
this is unnecessary; it won’t happen, 
remember that is the same thing they 
said about Roe, and look at where we 
are today. We should protect marriage 
equality now, well before the MAGA- 
controlled Supreme Court steps in. 
So I encourage my colleagues to con-
tinue these conversations. The Amer-
ican people support protecting mar-
riage rights of same-sex marriages by a 
large margin so let’s get it done. 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
Madam President, finally, on the leg-
islative front on the CR, both parties 
must work together to keep the gov-
ernment open beyond the September 30 
deadline. As my colleagues know, nego-
tiations continue on a CR to extend 
funding through about mid-December, 
which hopefully will give appropriators 
enough time to draft an omnibus fund-
ing package. 
I thank Chairman LEAHY, Ranking 
Member SHELBY, and everyone from 
both sides working to keep the govern-
ment open. No one wants to see a shut-
down—and I know that includes my 
Republican colleagues—but in order to 
avoid a shutdown, Senate Republicans 
must continue working with us to re-
solve the issues that remain. 
21ST ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11 
Madam President, finally, on the 21st 
anniversary of the horrible day, 9/11, 
everywhere I go, whenever I am wear-
ing a suit or a sport jacket, I wear this 
flag pin on my lapel, a small but con-
stant reminder of a promise America 
made 21 years ago: ‘‘Never forget.’’ 
It was on that day, September 12, 
2001, that having seen the horror, 
smelling the death in the air, hearing 
the horrible stories, and seeing hun-
dreds of people lined up with poignant 
signs that said: ‘‘Have you seen my 
son, Bill?’’ ‘‘Have you seen my mother, 
Mary?’’ because no one knew who was 
alive and who wasn’t—on that day, I 
called on Americans to wear the flag, 
to display it at their homes, out their 
windows, or at least wear it on their 
clothing. I have done so ever since, and 
every day, I look at that flag, and I 
think of the people who were lost and 
the vicious evil of those who per-
petrated this awful act. 
Yesterday, I joined with the Vice 
President, Governor Hochul, Mayor 
Adams, and others to honor the fallen 
on September 11, to grieve for those 
who were taken from us, and to affirm 
that over three decades later, though 
scarred and battered, our country and 
our democracy endure. 
An eternity can pass, and yet Sep-
tember 11 will always feel like yester-
day to me. As clearly as the Presiding 
Officer sits before me, I still remember 
what it was like to visit the wreckage 
a day or 2 later. The destruction, the 
smell, the noise was nothing like the 
New York I knew and loved. People, as 
I mentioned, lined up along the side-
walks hoisting makeshift signs that 
asked the unthinkable: ‘‘Have you seen 
my daughter?’’ ‘‘Have you seen my fa-
ther?’’ Those images, as well as the 
people I knew who were lost, will never 
leave me. 
Yet in the midst of so much pain on 
9/11, America encountered its best self. 
Ordinary people banded together to do 
extraordinary 
things. 
Taxi 
drivers, 
store 
managers, 
businessmen, 
city 
workers, and everyone in between, 
abandoned their day jobs and became 
heroes. They donated blood. They orga-
nized prayer vigils. 
I will never forget the sight of a shoe 
store owner along the route, as people 
escaped from the towers, handing out 
shoes, just depleting his entire stock so 
people could walk home. 
People volunteered their time and re-
sources to comfort those in need and 
rebuild our city to new heights, and 
the same is true for millions across the 
country. 
And to our first responders and vol-
unteers who worked the pile, we owe 
you such a special and undying meas-
ure of thanks. Among all our heroes of 
that time, they were among the great-
est and the most valiant, and many of 
them have paid for that with their 
lives because the toxins that were in 
the air entered their lungs and diges-
tive systems and caused cancers to the 
extent we have never known in those 
age groups before. 
That is why we worked so hard in 
this 
Chamber 
to 
help 
provide 
healthcare and help for those who have 
lost loved ones. When we say that 
America will ‘‘never forget’’ what hap-
pened on 9/11, we mean something far 
more 
profound 
than 
recalling 
the 
memories of that awful day. It is not a 
passive promise, but it is an active one. 
It is why, 2 months ago, the Senate 
worked together to pass the largest ex-
pansion of veteran healthcare benefits 
in decades, to aid the nearly 3 million 
servicemembers exposed to dangerous 
toxins while serving in Afghanistan, 
Iraq, and other places around the 
world. And it is why we must work to 
replenish that Ground Zero Fund that 
helped pay for the healthcare of those 
who rushed to the towers, and we must 
replenish that fund in the near future. 
And it is why all of us, regardless of 
party, must work together to defend 
the American way of life, to protect 
our precious democracy that the ter-
rorists tried to bring down by violent 
means. 
The world has changed dramatically 
since that morning that the towers 
fell, but the need to protect our Nation 
from threats, foreign and domestic, re-
main. 
Today, 21 years after the worst ter-
rorist attack in U.S. history, let us 
stay awake to the things we must do if 
we are to keep our promise to ‘‘never 
forget.’’ 
May God bless all those who died on 
September 11, as well as their families 
and all our first responders and service-
members who made the ultimate sac-
rifice in defense of our great Nation.

S4529 
September 12, 2022 
release the latest monthly update on 
the 
Democrats’ 
inflation, 
but, 
of 
course, the American people hardly 
need government statistics to explain 
to them that Washington Democrats’ 
reckless spending has sent prices sky-
rocketing. Working families have been 
feeling this pain in their pocketbooks 
every single day. Nearly two-thirds of 
middle-income Americans say inflation 
is negatively affecting their finances. 
An outright majority say they are ex-
periencing 
‘‘financial 
hardship.’’ 
A 
third of the country says they are 
struggling to meet basic family needs. 
One parent shopping for school sup-
plies recently told reporters: 
I had to start early because the prices are 
so high. . . . Being a parent, I want to give 
them the world. Sometimes, I wish I could 
give them more. 
But the back-to-school rush isn’t the 
only headache facing working families. 
Since President Biden and this all- 
Democratic government took office, 
prices on grocery store essentials, from 
meat to produce, have seen double- 
digit 
percentage 
increases. 
Some 
household items, like furniture, are 
over 20 percent more expensive than 
they were on Inauguration Day. The 
diesel fuel that moves practically ev-
erything through the supply chain and 
onto store shelves is up nearly 80 per-
cent since President Biden put his hand 
on the Bible. Households’ electric bills 
are up an average of 20 percent since 
January of 2021. Commuting and run-
ning errands costs more, with gasoline 
up 70 percent. As fall and winter ap-
proach, homes that burn fuel oil are set 
to be more than 75 percent more expen-
sive simply to keep warm. 
The American people know who cre-
ated this mess. They remember quite 
well how Washington Democrats spent 
the spring of 2021 dining out on left-
wing spending and leaving taxpayers to 
pick up the bill. Poll after poll has 
shown they are overwhelmingly dissat-
isfied with what President Biden and 
his party have done since then. 
One survey found five consecutive 
times that more than 70 percent of 
Americans say our country is headed in 
the wrong direction. But that hasn’t 
stopped Washington Democrats from 
calling the same disastrous play over 
and over and over again. 
For 
months—months—our 
col-
leagues’ primary focus was on repeat-
ing the mistake they made in 2021. In 
August, on a party-line vote, they did 
it. In the teeth of the worst inflation in 
over 40 years, every single Democrat in 
Congress voted to ram through hun-
dreds of billions of dollars more in lib-
eral spending. 
The American people’s top concern is 
runaway costs. And the supply chain 
crisis could get even worse—much 
worse—in the next few days if Demo-
crats let their far-left, Big Labor allies 
engage in massive railway worker 
strikes that would hamper the econ-
omy even further. But Washington 
Democrats’ top concerns appear to be 
something 
very 
different. 
They 
prioritized waging war on affordable 
American energy in a bill that will 
have no meaningful impact on global 
temperatures. They prioritized inflat-
ing the IRS with $80 billion to audit 
more American citizens without a word 
of accountability for when tax collec-
tors allow confidential information to 
become a political weapon. 
Even the supposed reason for the 
spending package, ‘‘inflation reduc-
tion,’’ is utter nonsense. Nonpartisan 
experts have concluded that what 
Washington Democrats did last month 
will not meaningfully reduce inflation 
at all and will actually make it worse 
in the near term. This is what Demo-
crats decided to put first for the better 
part of a year, and it is what they are 
now trying to peddle to the American 
people as a victory. 
But the American people don’t want 
tens of billions of dollars in wish ful-
fillment for climate activists; they 
want affordable gas and electricity. 
The American people don’t want a 
bloated IRS; they want stronger sup-
port for law enforcement at the south-
ern border and in their communities. 
Washington Democrats have consist-
ently misunderstood what the Amer-
ican people have asked them to do. 
They have repeatedly ignored the basic 
challenges they have created for work-
ing families. 
When the American people’s prior-
ities and Washington Democrats’ prior-
ities have diverged, this government 
has put the people last at every turn. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Iowa. 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
more than a year ago, a news website 
by the name of ProPublica published 
stories that it claims are based on ‘‘a 
vast trove of Internal Revenue Service 
data on the tax returns of thousands of 
the nation’s wealthiest people, cov-
ering more than 15 years.’’ Since then, 
ProPublica has continued to publish 
articles that appear to use data leaked 
or hacked from the IRS. 
Despite questions from Congress and 
immediate expressions of concern from 
the Treasury Department, as well as 
the IRS, we don’t know any more today 
than we did a year ago. Even though 
these apparent leaks of confidential 
taxpayer information appear to target 
the wealthy, not just the wealthy but 
all taxpayers and anyone who cares 
about 
effective 
tax 
administration 
should be very concerned. The fact is, 
until we get answers, we don’t know if 
anyone’s tax return or other informa-
tion submitted to the IRS is actually 
secure. 
At the end of the 2022 filing system, 
more than 145 million individual in-
come tax returns had been filed with 
the IRS. Right now, we don’t know if 
there is a current vulnerability to the 
IRS’s systems that makes this personal 
information accessible within the IRS 
or to bad actors outside of the IRS. We 
do not know if a foreign nation with 
hostile intentions is responsible for a 
leak or a hack of taxpayer information 
or the full scope of the IRS’s informa-
tion that may be involved. Just be-
cause ProPublica hasn’t found it politi-
cally useful to publicly disclose your 
private taxpayer information doesn’t 
mean that your tax information hasn’t 
been compromised. 
As I said earlier, in June of 2021, con-
cern was immediately expressed in the 
Congress and at the Treasury Depart-
ment. Almost on that very day, Com-
missioner Rettig appeared before the 
Finance Committee. In fact, it was on 
that very day that the first story was 
published. 
Commissioner Rettig said: 
I think that trust and confidence in the In-
ternal Revenue Service is sort of the bedrock 
of asking people and requiring people to pro-
vide financial information, and we have, as I 
said, turned it over to the appropriate inves-
tigators, external and internal. 
Attorney 
General 
Garland 
was 
quoted as saying: 
This is an extremely serious matter. Peo-
ple are entitled, obviously, to great privacy 
with respect to their tax returns. 
With this level of concern expressed 
so quickly, now a year ago, you would 
expect action to have been taken 
quickly. If you expected that, you 
would be wrong. Despite several letters 
sent by this Senator and other Mem-
bers of Congress, we don’t know any 
more today about what happened than 
we did last year on June 8, when this 
situation began. 
When testifying before the House 
Ways and Means Committee, Secretary 
Yellen said: 
I am as anxious as you are to find out what 
happened. 
As a strong proponent of congres-
sional oversight—as I am—of the exec-
utive branch, I have always been frus-
trated when the executive refuses to 
share relevant information that we 
need in Congress and are entitled under 
the Constitution to have. Secretary 
Yellen’s statement suggests a more dis-
turbing possibility where the executive 
branch completely lacks the sought- 
after information. Now, consider how 
shocking it is if the Secretary of the 
Treasury actually has no insight or 
any knowledge into a possible massive 
leak or hack of taxpayer information 
that occurred under her watch. 
In order to determine if any action 
had been taken, I, along with other Re-
publican members of the Judiciary 
Committee, wrote to Attorney General 
Garland and FBI Director Wray on 
June 24 of this year to ask what the 
status was of any investigation. This 
was the second time we tried to get 
this information. 
I know the Department of Justice is 
capable of taking action quickly when 
the Department of Justice wants to. I 
have written to the Attorney General 
several times about the memo that he 
issued in response to a letter from the 
National School Boards Association. 
That school board letter compared par-
ents to domestic terrorists. It took the 
Department of Justice only 5 days,

which included a weekend, to inject 
Federal law enforcement into local de-
bates with concerned parents. 
Clearly, the Attorney General is ca-
pable of taking action very quickly, 
but that seems to only be when an ad-
ministrative priority is of concern. I 
hope the Biden administration and the 
Garland Department of Justice would 
be as concerned about the protection of 
confidential taxpayer information as 
they are about monitoring concerned 
parents who testify before a school 
board. 
If the Department of Justice and the 
FBI want to show that they take the 
confidentiality of taxpayer informa-
tion seriously, they can start by fully 
and completely responding to my letter 
of June 24, which hasn’t yet been re-
sponded to. More than a full year, with 
a complete filing season, is too much 
time to have gone by without having 
any information on this leaking of tax-
payer information being provided to 
any extent. 
Democrats constantly spoke of the 
need for fairness in the tax system as 
they pushed through partisan tax-and- 
spending bills. Yet we have heard bare-
ly a peep out of our Democratic col-
leagues on what may be the largest un-
authorized disclosure of taxpayer infor-
mation in history. 
While we continue to wait for an-
swers, we have learned of another mas-
sive breach of taxpayer information. 
On the first Friday of September, we 
learned the IRS mistakenly published 
on its website private information from 
about 120,000 taxpayers. According to 
Politico, the disclosure consisted of 
‘‘details from business tax returns filed 
by tax-exempt organizations and re-
tirement accounts, included people’s 
names, business contact information 
and income produced by certain invest-
ments.’’ 
Clearly, the ability of the IRS to 
safeguard taxpayer information is still 
an ongoing issue. 
This new revelation should light a 
very big fire underneath the FBI to get 
at the bottom of the ProPublica leak 
or hack. Attorney General Garland and 
FBI Director Wray must fully respond 
to my letter and help all of us really 
understand if our tax system is safe 
and secure. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

EGYPT 
Mr. 
MURPHY. 
Madam 
President, 
Egypt is one of America’s closest al-
lies. Our taxpayers send them more di-
rect funding for their military than we 
send almost any other nation in the 
world. 
But here is what happens to political 
opponents of the Egyptian regime when 
they get arrested—and they get ar-
rested at a dizzying rate and get sent 
to the infamous Tora prison. Arrivals 
there are blindfolded and then are 
forced to run through a human corridor 
of guards who pummel them with 
sticks until they collapse. 
Following this initiation for political 
prisoners, many of them are routinely 
beaten and tortured for months or 
years on end, often with no formal 
charges being filed. Some never make 
it out alive. 
Human rights groups estimate that 
there are around 60,000 political pris-
oners in Egypt. 
I get it. The big numbers sometimes 
lose their meaning in this place. But, 
by comparison, estimates are that Rus-
sia has 420. China likely has around a 
thousand. Egypt locks up 60,000 polit-
ical opponents of the regime. 
To keep up with the demand of Presi-
dent El-Sisi’s imprisonment spree, the 
country has had to build 60 new deten-
tion centers over the last decades. 
These prisons house some of the coun-
try’s most prominent human rights de-
fenders, journalists, opposition leaders, 
but also just ordinary people who are 
locked up for years because they just 
attended a protest or they liked a 
Facebook post or they recorded a 
TikTok video. 
Let me tell you a story of just one of 
these 60,000 people. Right now, one of 
my constituents is suffering through 
the pain and uncertainty of having a 
relative unjustly imprisoned in Egypt. 
Muhammad Amasha is studying at 
Yale University, pursuing his Ph.D. 
Meanwhile, his father, Dr. Ahmed 
Amasha, was imprisoned in Egypt from 
2017 to 2019 and rearrested and jailed 
again in June of 2020. According to the 
U.N., his detention seems ‘‘to con-
stitute [an act of reprisal] against Dr. 
Amasha for documenting cases of en-
forced disappearances for the Special 
Procedures of the Human Rights Coun-
cil of the United Nations.’’ 
Since his arrest in 2020, Dr. Amasha 
reportedly has endured abuse during 
his interrogations that resulted in bro-
ken ribs and other significant injuries. 
His abuse included rape, electrocution, 
threats to rape his wife, and physical 
abuse while blindfolded. He was forced 
to sign a written confession during his 
time of abuse. 
Since 
President 
El-Sisi 
came 
to 
power in 2013, more than a thousand 
people have died in Egyptian custody. 
Fourteen percent of those deaths were 
torture. More than 70 percent are be-
cause of a denial of healthcare. 
This isn’t an adversary of the United 
States. This is Egypt, our ally. Every 
day that we continue to send billions of 
dollars to the Egyptian Government, 
while paying lipservice to these egre-
gious human rights violations, it is a 
blow both to our Nation’s character 
and to our credibility around the 
world. 
For the last several years, I fought to 
change our Egypt policy, and for the 
first time, in fiscal year 2021, we condi-
tioned, with no waiver, $75 million of 
Egypt’s $1.3 billion military aid pack-
age on ‘‘making clear and consistent 
progress on releasing political pris-
oners and providing detainees with due 
process of law.’’ Because there is no 
waiver, the administration either has 
to certify that Egypt has made this 
progress to merit the release of the 
money or that they haven’t made that 
progress and withhold the money. 
The record is clear that they have 
not. Let me just provide one way of 
measuring 
‘‘clear 
and 
consistent 
progress’’ on releasing political pris-
oners. A group of Egyptian human 
rights organizations submitted a list of 
2,954 known political prisoners to the 
government’s 
Presidential 
Pardon 
Committee earlier this year. These are 
people who should not be in jail. They 
simply protested the government. And 
if you are going to be an ally of the 
United States, you shouldn’t be lock-
ing people up for political speech. But 
of those 2,954 detainees, the govern-
ment released 49. That is not ‘‘clear 
and consistent progress.’’ 
Another metric: Since April, Egypt’s 
terrorism courts have ordered the re-
lease of 417 prisoners. But over that 
same time period, at least 4,400 polit-
ical prisoners have had their deten-
tions renewed by the courts. That is 
not ‘‘clear and consistent progress.’’ It 
is progress, but it is always one step 
forward and two or three steps back-
ward, at best. 
Egypt has certainly not made the 
kind of progress required to merit the 
release of $75 million. 
In addition to that piece of funding 
tied to political prisoners, Congress has 
also tied an additional $225 million of 
Egypt’s military aid to ‘‘sustained and 
effective steps’’ to improving Egypt’s 
human rights record—a broader record 
of human rights abuses. The statute 
lays out that, in order to receive this 
money, Egypt needs to allow NGOs and 
the media to operate freely, protect 
women and religious minorities, hold 
security forces accountable when they 
violate human rights, and investigate 
and prosecute these cases of forced dis-
appearances. 
Again, the record is overwhelmingly 
clear that things in Egypt have gotten 
worse on these fronts, not better, over 
the last year. Journalists are regularly 
still charged with ‘‘joining a terrorist 
group’’ or ‘‘spreading false news’’ for 
any critical reporting. Just last week, 
four journalists from the independent 
outlet Mada Masr were charged with a 
single news article that documented 
corruption within a political party 
close to the President. 
Earlier this year, human rights law-
yer Youssef Mansour was charged with 
‘‘inciting terrorism’’ after he wrote a 
social media post denouncing prison 
conditions. 
Egypt is also not content with im-
prisoning its critics at home but in-
creasingly 
is 
pursuing 
its 
critics 
abroad. News reports emerged in De-
cember that a prominent opposition

leader who lives in exile in Turkey had 
his phone hacked with NSO group soft-
ware. In January, the U.S. Justice De-
partment arrested a foreign agent here 
acting on behalf of Egypt. This is not 
the behavior of a foreign government 
that has made ‘‘significant progress’’ 
toward improving human rights to 
merit the release of $225 million. 
Lastly, every year when we have this 
debate, there are always proponents 
who argue that, even though Egypt has 
this horrific human rights record, we 
should give them the money anyway. 
The argument is that because Egypt is 
a really important strategic ally, if we 
withhold just a portion of the $1.3 bil-
lion, Egyptians might stop cooperating 
with us or shop around for another 
partner. 
Let me just take a minute to address 
the fallacy of this argument. First, 
Egypt does provide strategic benefits 
to the United States. Egypt provides 
counterterrorism 
cooperation. 
It 
shares 
intelligence 
with 
us 
about 
shared threats. Access to the Suez 
Canal is critical for the United States. 
When violence does flare up in Gaza, 
Egypt often steps in and helps mediate 
and facilitate a truce through its ties 
with Hamas. There are good reasons for 
the United States and Egypt to be 
partners. 
And it is not crazy that we give them 
military aid, but we shouldn’t delude 
ourselves into thinking that reducing 
our aid from $1.3 billion to $1 billion, 
after giving Egypt an entire year to 
meet these commonsense conditions, is 
going to cause the sky to fall. Just last 
year, the administration actually did 
withhold $130 million of Egypt’s aid. Of 
course, the Egyptians were angry. It 
probably did make our diplomats’ life a 
little bit harder in Egypt, but, by and 
large, our relationship didn’t change. 
The Egyptians still cooperated with us 
on counterterrorism. They provided 
Suez overflight access. They again fa-
cilitated a truce in Gaza. 
Why? Because all of these areas in 
which we engage are beneficial for the 
Egyptians. They don’t do it as simple 
payback for our aid. They engage with 
us on these issues. They engage with 
Israel because it is good for Egyptian 
security, 
notwithstanding 
whether 
they get $1 billion or $1.3 billion from 
the United States. 
We also sent a signal to the Egyp-
tians by withholding some of that 
money last year. And while we didn’t 
see significant improvements, we did 
see some political prisoners released. 
This year, we have to keep the pres-
sure up. The United States needs not 
just to talk the talk when it comes to 
human rights abroad; we need to be 
able to walk the walk as well. And the 
decision that the administration will 
make this week as to whether to com-
ply with the conditions set forth by 
Congress on holding the Egyptians ac-
countable for progress on human rights 
is critical to American credibility glob-
ally when it comes to our call to pro-
tect human rights and democracy 
abroad, and, for that reason, I would 
urge the administration to withhold 
the full $300 million as called for by the 
appropriations act until Egypt’s record 
gets better. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, like 
you, I am proud to represent the city of 
Chicago. On Friday, returning back 
home to Chicago, I had a chance to see 
the best of that great city. I traveled 
to the Salvation Army Freedom Center 
in Humboldt Park, in the city of Chi-
cago, where residents from around our 
city have come together to welcome 
the families who are seeking refuge in 
America. 
Our city’s agencies, State agencies, 
members of the faith community, and 
kind families have stepped up to pro-
vide supplies—the basics: clothing and 
such—and a safe place to sleep for 
many of these people who have come to 
America. These modest acts of gen-
erosity have changed everything for 
the families who have arrived at that 
Salvation Army Freedom Center be-
cause, for the first time in months, 
they feel safe and secure. And that is 
exactly why they left their home in the 
first place: to survive. 
In Chicago, we are honored to offer a 
warm, welcoming hand to these fami-
lies 
escaping 
unimaginable 
cir-
cumstances because in them we see 
ourselves, we see America, we see our 
history as a nation. And for me, per-
sonally, I see my own family. 
Back in 1911, a young Lithuanian 
woman set sail for America. She car-
ried two things with her: her Catholic 
prayer book, published the year before 
the Czars outlawed it in the nation of 
Lithuania; and her 2-year-old daughter 
Ona, my mother. 
More than a century stands between 
my mother’s arrival in America and 
the arrival of families I met Friday, 
but in many ways it is the same story. 
America opened its doors to my family 
all those years ago and gave us a 
chance to find a place for a new land of 
opportunity. Today, it is our responsi-
bility to welcome families fleeing vio-
lence and persecution, families seeking 
nothing more than safety and a fair 
shot. This is fundamental to who we 
are as Americans, but, sadly, it seems 
that some in politics think otherwise. 
You see, there is a reason these fami-
lies arrived in Chicago, and it is not be-
cause they booked a bus on their own 
accord. It is because the Governor of 
Texas has chosen to exploit this hu-
manitarian challenge to score political 
points. When these families arrived at 
our Nation’s border seeking asylum, 
what did the Governor of Texas do? He 
didn’t help. He took advantage of the 
fear and confusion. He rounded these 
families up, boarded them onto a bus, 
and shipped them to cities like Chicago 
and New York without even telling 
them where they were headed and 
without any consultation with their 
destination States. This is cruelty of 
the highest degree. 
The Governor of Texas didn’t provide 
any notice to Illinois or Chicago. He 
bused them to our Union Station down-
town, nearly 1,500 miles away from 
their Texas border, without sending as 
much as a text message in advance. No 
logic. No rationale. Just plain mean-
ness. 
Look, we can have reasonable dis-
agreements about how to address the 
situation at our Nation’s border, but 
there is no excuse for playing games 
with human lives. It is not the first 
time. Sadly, it is the playbook for 
many of the other party. You will re-
call when President Trump, the nomi-
nee or candidate, stood up and said 
they are all murderers and rapists com-
ing in from Mexico, or do you remem-
ber when more than a thousand chil-
dren—infants and toddlers—were sepa-
rated from their parents at the border? 
Some of them are still adrift, never 
being reunited with their families. 
One of the people I met on Friday 
was a man named Carlos. He and his 
wife are from Venezuela, a country 
with an economic and political crisis so 
severe that their family feared persecu-
tion and was on the brink of starva-
tion, even though Carlos was a hard 
worker, always looking for a job. 
So on May 15—May 15—Carlos and his 
wife did what they needed to do. Imag-
ine this, if you will. They picked up 
their two children—a 5-year-old little 
girl and a 1-year-old infant—and set 
out on a trip to the United States. 
They set out on foot to reach the 
Texas-Mexico border. Their journey 
was a nightmare: violence, theft, and 
exploitation. 
Carlos told me that at one point he 
thought he would die, with his wife and 
kids forced to spend nine nights in a 
Panamanian jungle. They were finally 
rescued by a local military force, but 
they had lost all their money, their 
cell phones. Everything had been sto-
len. 
They didn’t quit. They were deter-
mined, slowly making their way across 
Central America, primarily on foot, 
stopping from time to time. Carlos 
said: I would take any work they would 
give me. I would sell things on the 
street—whatever it was—to feed my 
family. 
It took 4 long months for them to 
reach our Nation’s border, and they 
had no destination in mind when they 
arrived, no contacts. They simply fol-
lowed instructions, and then they were 
placed on a bus by the Governor of 
Texas that took them to the city of 
Chicago. 
Carlos had no intention of ending up 
in this great city when he and his fam-
ily arrived in America, but he told me,

with real gratitude, that he wanted to 
stay in Chicago. I warned him to get 
ready for the winter. They have been 
amazed by the welcome they have re-
ceived from the Salvation Army and 
from so many others—Catholic Char-
ities and other groups—that stepped up 
to help. 
That is a similar sentiment I heard 
expressed by another man I met on Fri-
day, William. William is 42 years old. 
He sat down next to me as I was talk-
ing to this family. I thought he was a 
translator. He happily listened to the 
conversation back-and-forth. Finally, I 
turned to him and said: So what is your 
story? Again, he left Venezuela, left his 
family behind, and is hoping to get 
some work here so he can send some 
money back to his family. 
We talked about what he would do, 
and it was literally anything; he would 
take any job. I asked him if he had any 
family or friends in the United States. 
You know what he told me? He said: ‘‘I 
have you.’’ 
Before I left on Friday, both Carlos 
and William had something else to say 
to me. They both asked me the same 
question: When can I go to work? It 
should be a simple answer because the 
reality is they are legally in the coun-
try now awaiting a hearing on their ul-
timate status. That hearing could be a 
matter of months or years. And there 
are no shortage of work opportunities 
in Chicago and all across the country. 
Plenty of businesses—restaurants, en-
tertainment venues, nursing homes, 
landscaping—all of them would be 
happy to hire them, but under the law, 
currently, they cannot do that because 
asylum seekers like Carlos and William 
could be years away from the final de-
termination of their status in America. 
They are at least prohibited for the 
first 6 months from taking any kind of 
legal employment in the United States. 
How did that happen? We let them in 
the country. Yet we wouldn’t even 
allow them to work to feed their fami-
lies. 
Well, you won’t be surprised to know 
that was a decision by the Trump ad-
ministration. This administration of 
President Biden is trying to change it, 
but, in the meantime, they are faced 
with 
a 
horrible 
dilemma, 
a 
Jean 
Valjean moment if there ever was 
one—when they are trying to find some 
way to feed their families, but if they 
take a job and are paid for it in any 
way, they risk deportation. This is yet 
another example of a broken immigra-
tion system. 
The system has failed not just these 
families but our Nation’s economy as 
well. We have 10 million unfilled jobs 
in this country. We have 5 million un-
employed Americans. There are jobs in 
every 
direction. 
A 
leading 
restauranteur in Chicago, whom the 
Presiding Officer knows very well, said 
to me: If you took the undocumented 
workers out of the restaurants in Chi-
cago, you would turn out the lights. 
Behind those swinging doors in each 
of those restaurants are undocumented 
people doing the hard work: the dish-
washing, the food prep and cleanup 
that is part of being a restaurant. And 
the same thing is true when we talk 
about other areas. 
I had a visit from the Farm Bureau of 
Illinois, and they told me just point-
blank: We are desperate for workers, 
for migrant workers, to pick the crops 
at Alto Pass orchards in Southern Illi-
nois, to work in the dairy farms and 
dairy operations in Northwestern Illi-
nois. 
In every direction, they need these 
workers, and they need them now— 
farm workers, ag workers. And it isn’t 
just in the Midwest. It is across the Na-
tion, and yet we don’t have a system 
that allows for these people to come to 
this country and to legally work. It 
doesn’t make any sense. 
Now, of course, there are standards 
we ought to apply. They shouldn’t be 
offered any job that hasn’t been offered 
first to an American. That is our first 
obligation. I get it. And we ought to 
make sure that if they are going to be 
here, they are good people. 
I don’t believe we should knowingly 
allow any dangerous person to come 
into this country or to stay. If they are 
guilty of crimes while they are here, 
they should be punished and deported, 
period. The standards we should estab-
lish should keep our country safe, first 
and foremost. 
But, secondly, we have seen over the 
past 4 years, under the previous Presi-
dent, a complete downturn in the im-
migrants coming into this country to 
work, and that is why there are so 
many shortages in our current work-
force. We can do better, and we should 
do better. 
And there is a problem we have that 
is very fundamental. Our Nation’s 
birth rate is not keeping up with our 
demands for new workers. We have to 
accept that reality, particularly when 
it comes to entry level positions. 
We are a nation desperate for work-
ers, particularly young, able-bodied 
people like those two men that I met. 
But we can’t put them to work under 
the law as it stands today. How does 
that make any sense? 
It is the same story for millions of 
people living throughout our hemi-
sphere. Even though American employ-
ers should be willing to sponsor them, 
there are few, viable legal immigration 
pathways to bring them to America, 
and, as a result, the arduous journey to 
the Mexican-American border is the 
only option they have. 
I will be the first to agree with my 
colleagues on the other side in saying 
we need an orderly process at the bor-
der, and we do not have it today. 
I am chairman of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee. We have the responsi-
bility of writing the laws on immigra-
tion. And you say to yourself: Well, 
Senator, why haven’t you done it? 
And I can tell you why: Because our 
committee is evenly divided—11 Demo-
crats, 11 Republicans, as is the Senate, 
50–50—making it extremely difficult to 
pass anything controversial. 
It was 7 or 8 years ago when we put 
together a group of 8 Senators—4 
Democrats, 4 Republicans. I was glad 
to be part of forming that group. John 
McCain, 
LINDSAY
GRAHAM, 
MARCO 
RUBIO, and Jeff Flake were on the Re-
publican side; and on the Democratic 
side: myself, CHUCK
SCHUMER, BOB 
MENENDEZ, and MICHAEL BENNET. We 
put together a comprehensive immi-
gration bill and called it on the floor of 
the Senate here, and it passed with 68 
votes. We were elated. We finally found 
that sweet spot, that agreement. 
Oh, we said to President Trump: We 
will build some more of your wall. And 
I had second thoughts about that. But 
if that is what it took, we had an 
agreement for a comprehensive bill. 
We passed it in the Senate and sent it 
over to the House of Representatives, 
and under Paul Ryan’s Republican 
leadership, they refused to call it or 
consider it. It died, and nothing—noth-
ing—has been done ever since. In fact, 
nothing has been done for 30 years, 
when it comes to the immigration laws 
of this country. 
Is it any wonder the problems we 
face? 
We need an orderly process. We need 
to make sure that no dangerous person 
is going to come into this process and 
do our level best to keep them out. And 
we need to accept one reality, and that 
is that we cannot accept everyone in 
the world who wants to come to Amer-
ica tomorrow. 
The numbers are overwhelming. We 
have to have an orderly process and 
bring those people in that help us grow 
as a nation. 
Imagine, if you will—I thought about 
it from time to time in my own fam-
ily—sitting down in a small town—a 
small 
village 
then—in 
Lithuania. 
Jurbarkas was the name of the village. 
I can’t imagine what it was like over 
100 years ago, when my grandfather sat 
down with my grandmother and said: 
We are leaving for America. We are 
going to the land of opportunity. We 
are going to a place called East St. 
Louis, IL—which is where I was born. 
Imagine that decision—leaving your 
home, your church, your relatives, ev-
erything behind, and going to a land 
where you don’t speak the language. It 
sounds like an incredible decision on 
their part, and I marvel today that 
they even did it. A lot of the people 
around them in their same village 
must have said: Oh, that family, the 
Kutkaite family, they will be back. 
They weren’t. They came here. They 
endured, and because of that endurance 
and determination, I am standing here 
today. 
That kind of spirit in the DNA of 
people who are willing to sacrifice ev-
erything to be part of America is some-
thing we should not dismiss. This is 
not a selfish decision on the part of the 
heads of those families. This is a self-
less decision. For their family, they are 
willing to risk everything to come to 
this country.

Now, we need an orderly process to 
bring them into this country, as need-
ed, in the right fashion, and I believe 
we can achieve that. But, unfortu-
nately, politically, we are stopped at 
the moment. I am going to continue to 
work to try to find some bipartisan ap-
proach to this which will solve this 
problem. 
Our Nation’s immigration system 
should reward hard work and the deter-
mination that these people have to be 
in America. Instead of exploiting fami-
lies who are fleeing for their lives, we 
should all work together to create a 
system that reflects the best values of 
America. 
We are a nation of immigrants. Our 
diversity is our strength. Those who 
say we need some kind of ethnic purity 
are aspiring to a goal which does not 
serve us well. We have done just the op-
posite. We have taken people from dif-
ferent 
sections 
of 
the 
world 
and 
brought them together into the Amer-
ican family, and that is what is impor-
tant for our future as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
TRIBUTE TO FRANCISCO J. COLLAZO 
Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I am 
pleased this afternoon to commend Mr. 
Francisco J. Collazo of Grant, AL, for 
his contributions to our great country 
and to the State of Alabama. 
Born in 1931 in Puerto Rico, Mr. 
Collazo joined the Army at 15 years of 
age. He had an exceptionally distin-
guished career, serving in the Korean 
and the Vietnam wars and retiring as a 
chief warrant officer 4. 
While in the Army, Mr. Collazo con-
tinually worked to further his edu-
cation. Due to his 30 years of military 
service, he attended numerous Army 
technical schools and earned sufficient 
academic credits to receive the Depart-
ment of the Army bachelor’s equiva-
lency degree in mathematics and com-
puter science. 
After his retirement from the Army, 
he continued his lifelong learning with 
additional coursework and the study of 
complex missile systems. 
In 2003, the University of Alabama in 
Huntsville recognized his technical 
achievements and bestowed upon him 
an 
honorary 
degree 
of 
doctor 
of 
science. 
In 1980, Mr. Collazo and his wife Car-
men started COLSA Corporation in 
their garage in southeast Huntsville, 
AL. COLSA is a service-disabled, vet-
eran-owned company, and it rapidly 
grew and received many accolades. 
In 1983, COLSA was certified under 
the 8(a) Business Development Pro-
gram. The Small Business Administra-
tion certified COLSA as a socially and 
economically disadvantaged company. 
In 1988, the SBA selected COLSA as 
the Regional Small Business Prime 
Contractor 
of 
the 
Year—such 
an 
achievement. 
In 1997, COLSA received a Cogswell 
Award for Excellence in Security Oper-
ations. 
In 2004, COLSA was inducted into the 
Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame. 
NASA awarded COLSA the Small 
Business Prime Contractor of the Year 
Award in 2008. 
In 2021, Forbes magazine named 
COLSA to two of their top lists: Best 
Employers by State—4th in Alabama; 
and America’s Best Midsize Employ-
ers—17th overall in the United States. 
Today, COLSA has grown to over 
1,600 employees—1,600 employees from 
zero—and currently ranks as 76 on 
Washington Technology’s Top 100 Fed-
eral Prime Contractors. 
Frank Collazo has personally re-
ceived numerous awards and declara-
tions, some I have enumerated. In the 
military—just a few—he was awarded 
the Meritorious Service Medal with 
two oakleaf clusters, the Army Com-
mendation Medal with three oakleaf 
clusters, and a Bronze Star with one 
oakleaf cluster for distinguished serv-
ice during his time in Vietnam. 
As an industry leader, the Huntsville 
and Madison County Chapter of the Na-
tional Management Association recog-
nized Frank Collazo as the manager of 
the year 30 years ago, 1991. Mr. Collazo 
has served as president of the fol-
lowing: the Air Defense Artillery Asso-
ciation; the Air, Space, and Missile De-
fense Association; the Huntsville Chap-
ter of the National Defense Industrial 
Association. 
In 2018, he received the Davidson 
Award for his leadership in the defense 
community. In addition to his leader-
ship in industry, Mr. Collazo has been 
exceptionally generous in his contribu-
tions to local organizations. He funded 
the Collazo Endowment to retain and 
recruit students at the University of 
Alabama in Huntsville. He established 
the Francisco J. Collazo Scholarship 
Fund at Auburn University and is an 
original Partner in Education at the 
new Alabama School of Cyber Tech-
nology and Engineering located in 
Huntsville. 
He is a routine and substantial con-
tributor to over—yes, over—80 chari-
table organizations in the Tennessee 
Valley—that is including a lot of Ala-
bama and a lot of Tennessee—personi-
fying his motto when he says ‘‘Char-
acter is a matter of what you do when 
no one is watching.’’ 
I am pleased this afternoon here in 
the U.S. Senate to join the citizens in 
Huntsville, AL, and throughout the 
State of Alabama, in offering my sin-
cere thanks and gratitude to Frank 
Collazo, and I want to share my appre-
ciation with his wife, Carmen, and his 
extended family. 
Frank has continually demonstrated 
his commitment to our country, the 
State of Alabama, and to the commu-
nity. Basically, Frank Collazo is an 
outstanding American.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4534 
September 12, 2022 
This is a historic moment. If con-
firmed, Judge Mendoza would be the 
first Hispanic judge to serve on the 
Ninth Circuit from Washington. 
Judge Mendoza, whom I met before 
nominating him to the White House 
Counsel’s Office as a candidate for U.S. 
District Court for the Eastern District 
of Washington, has been somebody 
who, when you think about his child-
hood growing up in the Yakima Val-
ley—an agricultural area in Eastern 
Washington—he comes from a family 
of farm workers and has worked in the 
fields himself. 
As a young student at Prosser High 
School, it was not uncommon for him 
to wake up before dawn to work in the 
fields before rushing home to change 
and head to school. His hard work 
earned him admission to the Univer-
sity of Washington. 
After graduating from the University 
of Washington, he left the State to get 
his law degree from UCLA. After earn-
ing his degree, he returned home to 
Washington, where he worked as assist-
ant attorney general in the Wash-
ington State AG’s Office. 
He went on to serve the community 
he grew up in, first as a deputy pros-
ecutor for Franklin County and then as 
a judge in the Benton-Franklin Supe-
rior Court. He has been an outstanding 
judge on the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Washington, where 
he has served since 2014. Clearly, my 
colleagues here in the Senate saw his 
potential since he was confirmed to the 
Eastern District 92 to 4. 
Judge Mendoza is not just an out-
standing jurist; he is a community 
leader as well. He has served on the 
boards of directors for numerous orga-
nizations in Central Washington, in-
cluding the Benton-Franklin Legal Aid 
Society, the Benton and Franklin 
Counties Circle of Hope Foundation for 
Drug Courts, and the United Way of 
Benton and Franklin Counties. 
I know Judge Mendoza will make an 
excellent addition to the Ninth Circuit 
Court, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port his nomination to the court of ap-
peals. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today the Senate is poised to confirm 
another outstanding judicial nominee: 
Judge Salvador Mendoza, Jr., nomi-
nated to the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. 
Judge Mendoza is a highly experi-
enced jurist with a lifelong commit-
ment to public and community service. 
After graduating from the University 
of Washington and UCLA School of 
Law, Judge Mendoza joined the office 
of the Franklin County, WA pros-
ecuting attorney, where he handled a 
range of felony and misdemeanor cases. 
Following this role, Judge Mendoza en-
tered private legal practice, simulta-
neously serving as a judge pro tempore 
on various Washington State munic-
ipal, district, and juvenile courts. He 
then served 2 years on the Washington 
State superior court. 
In 2014, President Obama nominated 
Judge Mendoza to the Eastern District 
of Washington, and the Senate con-
firmed him on an overwhelmingly bi-
partisan vote, 92–4. Judge Mendoza has 
distinguished himself on the bench, 
presiding over dozens of trials and dem-
onstrating evenhandedness and impar-
tiality in all matters that have come 
before him. And once confirmed, Judge 
Mendoza will be the first judge of His-
panic origin to sit on a Washington 
seat on the Ninth Circuit. 
The American Bar Association has 
unanimously 
rated 
Judge 
Mendoza 
‘‘well qualified,’’ and he enjoys the 
strong support of his home State Sen-
ators, Mrs. MURRAY and Ms. CANTWELL. 
I will support Judge Mendoza’s con-
firmation, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the nomination 
of Judge Salvador Mendoza, from my 
home State of Washington, to serve on 
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-
cuit. 
I was honored to recommend Judge 
Mendoza for this seat to President 
Biden and to introduce him before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee in May. 
I was thrilled to see him advance out 
of the committee in a bipartisan vote, 
and I couldn’t be happier to support 
him today and to strongly urge all my 
colleagues to join me in voting for his 
confirmation to the bench. 
Judge Mendoza is a lifelong Wash-
ington State resident and a tremen-
dously qualified candidate to join the 
Ninth Circuit Court. He has served as a 
district court judge for the Eastern 
District of Washington since 2014, when 
he was confirmed by the Senate with 
an overwhelming, bipartisan majority 
of 92–4. 
In his time on the bench in the East-
ern District, he has presided over near-
ly 
1,500 
cases—including 
appellate 
cases—where he treated every party 
who came before him with fairness and 
respect. 
And before that, he served Wash-
ington State as a Superior Court 
Judge. 
He also has experience as a pros-
ecutor, in the State attorney general’s 
office, and as a solo practitioner, where 
he often represented defendants who 
could not afford their own attorneys. 
He also worked to establish the first 
drug court in Benton and Franklin 
counties, along with prosecutors, de-
fense attorneys, mental health profes-
sionals, and other judges. 
From 
representing 
those 
without 
means, to establishing drug courts, to 
serving with distinction on the Eastern 
District Court, Judge Mendoza has 
been a trailblazer, focused on building 
a more fair and just legal system that 
works 
for 
everyone—not 
just 
the 
wealthy and well-off. 
Judge Mendoza’s many years of pub-
lic service and even-handed application 
of the law have earned him not only 
the support of people across the State 
of Washington, but also the respect of 
both Democrats and Republicans. 
It is why my bipartisan judicial 
merit selection committee, which in-
cludes top Republican lawyers, rec-
ommended him to serve in his current 
district court judgeship 8 years ago and 
why he was confirmed to that judge-
ship in an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
vote. And that should be no different 
today. 
Beyond just his impeccable profes-
sional qualifications, Judge Mendoza 
will bring an important perspective to 
one of the most consequential appel-
late courts in this country: the per-
spective of someone whose parents im-
migrated to the U.S. from Mexico and 
worked as farm laborers, maids, and 
factory workers to build a better life 
for their family; the perspective of 
someone who, as a child, worked beside 
them on farms in the Yakima Valley; 
the perspective of someone who was 
the first Latino Federal judge in the 
Eastern District of Washington and 
who would break new ground once 
again as the first Latino from Wash-
ington State to serve on the Ninth Cir-
cuit. 
Confirming Judge Mendoza will bring 
us even closer to building a Federal 
bench that reflects the diversity of the 
people it serves. That is especially im-
portant to me and to the many people 
across the country who don’t currently 
see themselves represented on our Na-
tion’s courts. 
I have no doubt—and based on his 
record, I think there can be no doubt 
that serving on the Ninth Circuit, 
Judge Mendoza will carefully review 
each case as an appellate judge, respect 
every party that appears before him, 
and protect the rights of the American 
people. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in supporting his confirmation. 
Ms. CANTWELL. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

to be United States Circuit Judge for 
the Ninth Circuit. 
VOTE ON MENDOZA NOMINATION 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Mendoza nomination? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

TRIBUTE TO BOWLING GREEN’S 
GAINES FAMILY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
after five generations and 140 years of 
ownership, Bowling Green, Kentucky’s 
Gaines Family has made the difficult 
decision to sell their newspaper, the 
Bowling Green Daily News. Today, I 
ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring these towering figures in Bowling 
Green’s history, thanking them for 
their service to the Commonwealth, 
and wishing the best for their paper’s 
success under its new owners. 
The Gaineses laid down the roots of 
the Bowling Green Daily News in 1882 
when John B. Gaines founded the Bowl-
ing Green Daily Times. At the time, 
the city sported several newspapers, 
but the Gaines family’s paper quickly 
rose above the rest. The Daily Times 
later merged with its chief rival, the 
Bowling Green Democrat, to create a 
new daily called the Park City Daily 
News. The paper’s name derived from 
Bowling Green’s nickname, ‘‘beautiful 
park city,’’ given to the city in an 1892 
speech by Congressman and journalist 
Henry Watterson. The paper dropped 
its new moniker after nearby Glasgow 
Junction, KY, rechristened itself Park 
City in 1938, adopting Bowling Green 
Daily News as its name shortly there-
after. 
In the decades following, local news-
papers around the country consolidated 
into large news media corporations. 
The Gaines family remained fiercely 
independent, though, keeping their 
paper family-owned and -operated de-
spite outside pressure. They under-
stood that, to provide the best possible 
coverage of life, breaking news, sports, 
and politics in Bowling Green, the 
paper had to be run by a local family 
with deep ties to the community. The 
Gaines family passed ownership down 
from one generation to another, and by 
this year, the Bowling Green Daily 
News was one of the oldest family- 
owned newspapers remaining in the 
South. 
From my first run for statewide of-
fice until today, I have had the pleas-
ure of working closely with the Bowl-
ing Green Daily News’s editorial and 
news teams. Often when I visit Bowling 
Green, I go straight to the paper’s of-
fices to meet with members of the edi-
torial board and the Gaines family to 
discuss current events in the Common-
wealth. Alone among most of Ken-
tucky’s largest papers, the Bowling 
Green Daily News opinion pages are 
filled with a diversity of ideas and dis-
course. As a result, their editorials 
usually come closest to reflecting what 
most 
Kentuckians 
actually 
believe 
about their State and our politics. 
Over the decades, I have developed a 
close working relationship with the 
Gaines family and especially Pipes 
Gaines, the publisher emeritus of the 
Bowling 
Green 
Daily 
News. 
Pipes 
joined the family paper full-time in 
1966, following a career in the U.S. 
Army that included Active Duty in 
Korea. He has been a mainstay of the 
paper ever since, navigating rapid 
changes in the media industry and 
shepherding the next generation of tal-
ent into leadership roles at the news-
paper, including his sons, Scott and 
Steve Gaines. Last year, Scott suc-
ceeded his father as the paper’s pub-
lisher and joined his brother, who 
serves as an editor, as the fifth genera-
tion of Gaineses to help lead the Bowl-
ing Green Daily News. 
The Gaines family delivered an im-
mense service to Bowling Green by 
running the city’s flagship paper, but 
refused to keep their public works con-
fined strictly to the family business. In 
2007, the Gaines family created the 
Gaines Family Fund for Excellence in 
Print Journalism at Bowling Green’s 
Western Kentucky University, forming 
an incubator for future local journal-
ists at WKU’s School of Journalism 
and Broadcasting. This type of gen-
erosity was part and parcel of the 
Gaineses’ 
success, 
demonstrating 
a 
deep dedication for, and connection to, 
life in Bowling Green. 
The Gaines family’s impact on Bowl-
ing Green has been felt all across Ken-
tucky. From media, to education, to 
philanthropy, their extraordinary work 
on the Commonwealth’s behalf will 
have an enduring impact. I thank the 
entire Gaines family for their steward-
ship of Kentucky’s news media and 
wish them the best in the next stages 
of the family’s life.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASBURY 
THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Asbury 
Theological 
Seminary 
in 
Wilmore, KY, has charted quite a few 
major milestones in American Chris-
tian life. The school was the home of 
the first Christian music festival in the 
country; they established the first de-
partment of prayer and spiritual life at 
an American seminary; they have read-
ied thousands of graduates to serve at 
every level of religious life. This year, 
Asbury is celebrating another mile-
stone, marking 100 years of operation. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring this renowned Kentucky institu-
tion and recognizing its outstanding 
contributions to our Nation’s spiritual 
strength. 
When 
Dr. 
Henry 
Clay 
Morrison 
founded Asbury Theological Seminary 
a century ago, he did so with one sim-
ple motto: ‘‘the whole Bible for the 
whole world.’’ Back then, the school 
only had three students and a skeleton 
staff. But Dr. Morrison was an ener-
getic, effective leader, and soon, As-
bury was attracting theological stu-
dents from across the country and 
world to learn how to spread the gospel 
in the tradition of John Wesley. 
Since its earliest days, Asbury has 
grown by leaps and bounds, now enroll-
ing more than 1,800 students from 80 
denominations and 50 countries. It is 
among the 10 largest accredited theo-
logical seminaries in the country, with 
satellite campuses in Tennessee, Okla-
homa, Colorado, and Florida and a ro-
bust online presence. The seminary 
also shares a heritage with Asbury Uni-
versity, one of Kentucky’s finest Chris-
tian universities, and helps the school 
provide a faith-driven education to stu-
dents pursuing secular professions. 
Today, Asbury’s reach extends far be-
yond Kentucky and all across the 
globe. With several U.S. Navy chap-
lains as graduates, they even have rep-
resentation in every time zone on the 
planet. Asbury alumni have served as 
pastors, church planters, missionaries, 
counselors, educators, nonprofit lead-
ers, and in government. As much as the 
school has grown over the past 100 
years, though, Asbury remains firmly 
rooted in its Jessamine County home. 
The vibrant community surrounding 
the school is a testament to its found-
ers’ enduring commitment to Ken-
tucky. 
I would like to extend my sincere 
thanks to Asbury Theological Semi-
nary president, Dr. Timothy Tennent, 
and to all of Asbury’s administrators, 
professors, alumni, and students, who 
do so much to support mission-based

have helped put Kentucky at the cen-
ter of America’s religious education 
system. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating Asbury Theological 
Seminary on a century of service and 
success and wish them the best as their 
school continues to evangelize and 
spread scriptural holiness throughout 
the world.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
section 3002 of S. Con. Res. 14, the fis-
cal year 2022 congressional budget reso-
lution, allows the chairman of the Sen-
ate Budget Committee to revise budget 
aggregates, committee allocations, and 
the pay-as-you-go ledger for legislation 
considered under the resolution’s rec-
onciliation instructions. 
I find that H.R. 5376, an act to pro-
vide for reconciliation pursuant to title 
II of S. Con. Res. 14, fulfills the condi-
tions found in section 3002. Accord-
ingly, I am revising the allocations for 
eight of the reconciled committees and 
revising other enforceable budgetary 
levels to account for the budgetary ef-
fects of the law. This adjustment re-
flects the estimate of the law as en-
acted provided by the Congressional 
Budget Office on September 7, 2022. 
This adjustment supersedes the ad-
justments I previously made for the 
processing of Senate amendment Nos. 
5194, 5472, and 5488 to H.R. 5376 on Au-
gust 6 and 7. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustments, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

resolution, specifies that the budgetary effects of a reconciliation bill with 
net deficit reduction ‘‘shall never be made available on the pay-as-you-go- 
ledger.’’ Since the savings from H.R. 5376 will not be entered the PAYGO 
scorecard, no adjustment is necessary. The law will reduce on-budget defi-
cits by $53.523 billion over 2022–2031.

TRIBUTE TO RENEE COHEN 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Renee 
Cohen, a member of my staff who is re-
tiring after more than 37 years of serv-
ice to the people of Maryland. Renee 
has been with me since I served as 
speaker of the house in the Maryland 
General Assembly before I won election 
to the U.S. House of Representatives in 
1986. 
W.H. Auden said, ‘‘We are all here on 
earth to help others; what on earth the 
others are here for I don’t know.’’ Cer-
tainly, Renee has devoted her life to 
helping others, and she has made an ex-
traordinary difference in the lives of so 
many people and families. She is a na-
tive Baltimorean and a graduate of 
Forest Park High School, where she 
was an officer in her sorority and ex-
celled academically. She grew up sur-
rounded by aunts and uncles, especially 
the Pollakoffs on her mother’s side of 
the family. She attended Temple Uni-
versity, where she earned an associ-
ate’s degree that allowed her to work 
as a dental hygienist. She worked to 
help support her mother, who was wid-
owed when Renee was a young teen-
ager. 
Renee married the love of her life, 
Jonas Cohen, in 1960, and they had 
three wonderful sons, Mark, Adam, and 
Ethan. Renee has been a devoted moth-
er and grandmother. When her sons

were old enough, she returned to 
school, to Notre Dame College of Mary-
land, now known as Notre Dame of 
Maryland University, to earn a bach-
elor’s degree in fine arts. She is a gift-
ed artist. 
Renee and Jonas found many oppor-
tunities for volunteer work and leader-
ship roles through the Associate Jew-
ish Charities. Her influence and reach 
in local civic life and politics contin-
ued to expand to the point where I 
knew I needed her on my staff as a con-
stituent liaison. When I entered the 
House of Representatives in 1987, Renee 
became a caseworker, focusing on 
healthcare and senior citizen issues. 
She has had a special interest and in-
sight into these issues after caring for 
her mother, Rose Katz, who lived to be 
105, and her husband, who had a pro-
gressive illness before he passed away 
in 2020. Since I joined the Senate, 
Renee has been an indefatigable field 
representative for me on health and 
senior issues and a liaison to the Jew-
ish community. 
Try as we might, Senators cannot be 
in two places at once. We depend on 
staff to represent us. If you were to 
Google Renee, you would find numer-
ous articles and pictures of her rep-
resenting me in Baltimore and around 
the State, at healthcare fairs and other 
events, where she shared her knowl-
edge, contacts, and other information 
with constituents who needed Federal 
assistance of some kind. She particu-
larly relished helping people to under-
stand and navigate the Affordable Care 
Act. 
Much of what Senators do can seem 
ethereal or intangible. Staffers like 
Renee represent where ‘‘the rubber hits 
the road.’’ Casework and the sort of 
outreach Renee performed is intensely 
personal. Renee helped people receive 
their Social Security retirement, So-
cial Security disability, and supple-
mental security income payments and 
Medicare benefits. She excelled because 
she is empathetic and has a passion for 
service, for problem-solving, and for 
strategic thinking. If, for any reason, 
she was unable to offer assistance— 
which was exceedingly rare—she had a 
knack for finding agencies that the 
rest of us never knew existed for a re-
ferral. She would never end a call with, 
‘‘I’m sorry, we can’t help you.’’ She al-
ways went the proverbial extra mile. 
Another keen interest of Renee’s has 
been science, technology, engineering, 
and 
mathematics—STEM—education. 
Renee was instrumental in helping to 
establish STEM programs for under-
served students in schools across Mary-
land and the annual STEM Expo at 
Morgan State University. She calls 
these projects ‘‘my baby,’’ and edu-
cators affectionately refer to Renee as 
‘‘the STEM Queen.’’ 
Renee has worked for me longer than 
any other member of my staff. It was 
inevitable that I would consider her as 
a member of my extended family and 
vice versa. I have been so fortunate to 
have her by my side for nearly 40 years. 
The positive difference she has made in 
so many people’s lives is incalculable. 
She has run the race and is ready to re-
tire—sort of. Renee is not someone who 
lets the grass grow under her feet so 
she will return to the office occasion-
ally as a ‘‘senior intern,’’ helping an-
swer the phones and pitching in on 
casework. I am grateful we will stay 
connected. But she will have more time 
to devote to her family and friends and 
her avocation, which is painting. Renee 
sees the beauty in the people she has 
faithfully served and in the natural 
world, which she captures on canvas. 
On behalf of my Senate colleagues and 
the people of Maryland, I want to ex-
press my undying gratitude to Renee 
for nearly four decades of exemplary 
service, congratulate her on her retire-
ment, and extend my best wishes to her 
as she turns the page, paint brushes in 
hand, to a new chapter in a life well- 
lived. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ROBERT A. HAND 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Robert 
‘‘Bob’’ Hand as he retires this week 
after 40 years of faithful service to the 
Commission on Security and Coopera-
tion in Europe, also known as the Hel-
sinki Commission. The Commission is 
an independent U.S. Government agen-
cy Congress created in 1975 to monitor 
and encourage compliance with the 
Helsinki Final Act and other commit-
ments undertaken since then by the 
Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe, OSCE. The Commis-
sion consists of nine members from the 
House of Representatives, nine mem-
bers from the U.S. Senate, and one 
member each from the Departments of 
State, Defense, and Commerce. The 
House and Senate share the positions 
of chair and cochair and rotate every 2 
years, when a new Congress convenes. 
For the Commission to function, it re-
lies on expert professional staff who 
must be as nonpartisan as they are ex-
pert in their fields. 
I am, during this 117th Congress, the 
chair of the Helsinki Commission, 
though for these remarks it is impor-
tant to note that I have served on the 
Commission since the 103rd Congress, 
dating back to my time in the House of 
Representatives. When I joined the 
Commission in 1993, as the several Bal-
kan Wars were unfolding in the former 
Yugoslavia, Bob Hand was already the 
go-to person on Capitol Hill for news 
and information—and explanations—of 
what was happening in the Western 
Balkans. I have worked with Bob for 29 
years now. I have relied on him for 29 
years. I have respected his intellect 
and his prodigious work ethic for 29 
years. 
This month, Bob retires as the long-
est serving staff person on the Helsinki 
Commission, with 40 years of service. 
Bob earned a B.A. in international re-
lations and Russian area studies, with 
a minor in economics, from the School 
of International Service at American 
University in 1983 but actually started 
at the Commission in 1982 as an intern. 
After he graduated, he quickly moved 
to full-time staff in 1983. Throughout 
the years, he has shown exceptional 
professionalism and has always been 
willing to go above and beyond the call 
to do whatever was necessary to ensure 
that the Commission served mandate 
defended human rights. His deep exper-
tise on the Western Balkans has made 
him renowned among policy profes-
sionals in Washington, and his appear-
ances on Voice of America and TOP 
channel in Albania nearly made him a 
household name there. 
Bob worked tirelessly throughout the 
wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 
1990s to ensure that members of the 
Helsinki Commission had the best in-
formation and analysis of develop-
ments when formulating legislation 
and policy responses to address the ag-
gression, 
war 
crimes, 
and 
ethnic 
cleansing which took place in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995. He 
helped to document these atrocities 
through numerous hearings and brief-
ings and reports. He also advised Hel-
sinki Commissioners as they pressed 
U.S. leadership to use NATO assets to 
end the siege of Sarajevo and protect 
UN-designated safe havens and to lift 
the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. 
Bob was an early proponent of the es-
tablishment 
of 
the 
International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugo-
slavia—ICTY—to hold those respon-
sible for atrocities to account, includ-
ing for the Srebrenica genocide, which 
he has ensured the Commission com-
memorates each year in memory of 
those murdered. He has also ensured 
that other cases stay at the forefront 
of policy attention, particularly the 
Bytyqi brothers, three Albanian-Amer-
icans whose murdered bodies were 
found in Serbia in 2001 and for whom 
Bob has never stopped seeking justice. 
Bob is also an expert on Albania, and 
he helped organize a Helsinki Commis-
sion visit to Albania in 1990, the first 
U.S. Government agency visit to that 
nation since relations were severed in 
1946. He returned to Albania numerous 
times over the years, observed most of 
the country’s elections over the past 
two decades, and through his thought-
ful and in-depth analysis of political 
developments in the country, became a 
respected commentator on Albanian 
radio and television. 
Bob served on numerous U.S. delega-
tions to OSCE Meetings, observed doz-
ens of elections, and he even served as 
a mission member on one of the OSCE’s 
first field missions: the OSCE Missions 
of Long Duration in Kosovo, Sandjak 
and Vojvodina, stationed in Novi Pazar 
in 1993. He is not just one our Nation’s 
top experts on the Western Balkans; he 
is also a fount of knowledge on the 
OSCE itself, and especially the OSCE’s 
Parliamentary Assembly, PA. 
Bob has served for many years as the 
Secretary of the U.S. Delegation to the 
Parliamentary Assembly. In that role,

he deftly ensured that our delegation 
was 
not 
only 
well-prepared 
both 
logistically and substantively, but also 
through working diplomatically with 
other delegations, he ensured that our 
proposals, 
resolutions, 
and 
amend-
ments had the best possible chance of 
being successfully adopted. Most re-
cently at the OSCE PA annual session 
in Birmingham, Bob worked diligently 
with several other delegations to en-
sure that a critical resolution con-
demning Russia’s unprovoked invasion 
of Ukraine was adopted with the 
strongest possible language. 
Bob has also always been a voice of 
reason, humanity, and fairness. He did 
not refrain from criticizing U.S. policy 
when it was warranted and several 
times advocated that the United States 
proactively discuss its own short-
comings with other OSCE countries, 
including after reports of prisoner 
abuse in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, surfaced in 
2003. Among Commission staff, he was 
always quick to support his colleagues, 
but also did not shy away from debat-
ing the pros and cons of ideas. Above 
all, Bob has always sought to do what 
is right—for the Helsinki Commission, 
for the U.S. Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, for the United States, and 
for the promotion of human rights, de-
mocracy, and rule of law throughout 
the 57 nations of the OSCE. 
A little over 2 years ago, I paid trib-
ute to another Commission staffer, 
Erika Schlager, on her retirement after 
34 years of service. It so happens that 
Bob and Erika are husband and wife. 
Bob and Erika have devoted their 
lives—75 years and counting—to de-
fending and promoting human rights. 
They have been passionate and remark-
ably effective advocates for the world’s 
downtrodden and disenfranchised. 
The Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, 
former Anglican Archbishop of Cape 
Town, South Africa, remarked, ‘‘It 
means a great deal to those who are op-
pressed to know that they are not 
alone.’’ For the past 40 years, oppressed 
people around the world, but especially 
in Eastern and Central Europe, knew 
they weren’t alone because Bob Hand 
was fighting for them. I know I speak 
on behalf of my Senate colleagues, my 
fellow Commissioners, and Bob’s wide 
circle of professional colleagues and 
admirers when I say that I will miss 
him. I am grateful for his stalwart 
service and wish him all the best for 
his future endeavors.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TRACIE TEXAS 
SHIFFLETT 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, after 
more than 25 years of service—first as 
an officer, then as executive director of 
the Louisville Metro Police Founda-
tion, LMPF—Tracie Shifflett has an-
nounced that she will retire from the 
foundation in September. 
The LMPF is an independent, private 
nonprofit organization, the only orga-
nization authorized to raise funds on 
behalf of the Louisville Metro Police 
Department. LMPF supports special 
community programs to strengthen re-
lationships between police and the 
communities 
they 
serve, 
purchase 
equipment and training programs, and 
grants for the Officers in Distress Pro-
gram. 
Shifflett took on leadership of the 
LMPF in 2016 after retiring from the 
Louisville Metro Police Department as 
a lieutenant over the training acad-
emy. The rank of lieutenant is the 
highest achievable rank on your merit 
within the department. 
‘‘I always felt our officers were like 
my kids,’’ Shifflett said. ‘‘I felt like my 
work with the Foundation was a way I 
could truly help them.’’ 
During her tenure as its leader, the 
foundation has grown from less than 
$700,000 in total assets to $2.4 million. 
Tracie dealt with many challenges and 
faced all of them with grace, love, and 
a great sense of humor. She has put her 
own life on hold many times to be 
there for ‘‘her’’ officers, the board, and 
the Louisville community. She has re-
peatedly set new records for fund-
raising at the LMPF’s annual event by 
sharing the unvarnished truth of what 
officers face every day while serving. 
Her passion both while serving on 
LMPD and for the LMPF was to make 
sure ‘‘her babies’’ were taken care of, 
that they felt loved, and had the sup-
port needed to continue to make a dif-
ference every day. 
‘‘I’m especially proud that we have 
been able to positively impact at least 
50 officer families each year that have 
faced injury, medical diagnosis, or 
other critical needs,’’ Shifflett said. 
‘‘Since 2016, we have granted $1.7 mil-
lion to officer families who are facing 
life-altering difficulty.’’ 
Some of the foundation’s key accom-
plishments under Shifflett’s leadership 
include training programs, purchasing 
equipment, and the Officers in Distress 
Program. 
Tracie has partnered with many offi-
cers and helped to strengthen their 
bonds in the community with programs 
like Shop with a Cop, Gang Resistance, 
and Education Training. The depart-
ment has also helped build and provide 
bedding to 100 kids in the community, 
purchased new bleachers for the Cali-
fornia 
Community 
Center, 
and 
launched the Help Us Give fund. She 
also secured funding for seven mounted 
patrol horses, purchased nine K–9s for 
patrol work and narcotics detection, 
some of which went on to win the Na-
tional K–9 Olympics Competition, and 
obtained K–9 trauma kits and K–9 pro-
tective vests for all LMPD K–9s. In her 
last few weeks with the foundation, she 
secured two Kid ID Kits for LMPD to 
use in the community. 
Jim Ellis, chairman of the Louisville 
Metro Police Foundation, said the fol-
lowing about Tracie in her evaluation: 
‘‘Tracie has become the go-to person 
for many members of LMPD when they 
have a gripe, concern, or problem. I be-
lieve that is a great demonstration of 
the trust the officers have in our Foun-
dation and our Executive Director. 
Tracie receives inquiries from other 
Foundations around the county on how 
we implement and apply checks and 
balances to each of our grants. Tracie 
maintains confidentiality with sen-
sitive and life-altering data and infor-
mation that comes into the Founda-
tion. This confidentiality helps protect 
the safety of the LMPD and the Foun-
dation’s board members. Tracie is 
unique in that she is a former police of-
ficer and understands what the men 
and women of the LMPD want and need 
to make Louisville safer. She lets them 
know what is possible to achieve and 
what may be beyond the Board’s abil-
ity to obtain or provide. She hates to 
deny any request, but if it is denied, 
she works to solve the problem. Tracie 
has become somewhat of a parental fig-
ure for many members of LMPD.’’ 
Almost every targeted foundation 
project was obtained under her leader-
ship. One of the things that Tracie was 
proud to have accomplished during her 
tenure at the foundation is securing 
funding for high-velocity bulletproof 
vests for every LMPD officer, which re-
cently saved the life of an officer. An-
other highlight of her career was re-
ceiving her master’s degree in edu-
cation. 
She is incredibly proud of her close 
family: her mother, Judy, her late fa-
ther, Benjamin, her son, Ben, her 
daughter, Alex, and her husband, John, 
a retired police officer. 
I am proud to salute Tracie for her 
dedicated career in making our com-
munity a safer place to live.∑
