INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HISTORIC 
ROLE OF VICTORY GARDENS 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Earth Day by introducing a resolution 
recognizing the historic role Victory Gardens 
have served in strengthening our country’s 
food security, health education; and commu-
nity morale through the worst of times, includ-
ing World War I, II and their current impor-
tance as we battle the current Coronavirus 
pandemic. I want to thank my dear colleague 
and proud son of Nebraska, Ranking Member 
JEFF FORTENBERRY, for partnering with me on 
this valiant endeavor. 
America faced many challenges head-on 
during World War I and World War II, and 
even the youngest and oldest citizens across 
the country could participate. Millions came to-
gether to strengthen food security by planting 
Victory Gardens. Again today, we find our-
selves facing a new enemy, an invisible 
enemy—COVID–19. Its devastation is broad 
and indiscriminate. Life as we have known it 
is forever changed. But as we seek comfort 
and higher purpose, the call to reignite the pa-
triotism of Victory Gardens rings loud. Let us 
unite once more to strengthen community 
while we are apart and help supplement trou-
bled food chains to defy and delay insecurity. 
The harvest of fresh fruits and vegetables in 
our own backyards would have an indelible 
impact for our families and neighbors. 
This challenge presents a ripe opportunity to 
educate our children on the value of mother- 
Earth, as we implement home schooling les-
sons with schools shuttered. Investments, 
whether time, effort, or financial, in Victory 
Gardening will help teach our young citizens 
the fundamentals of healthy and nutritious 
food, and the sense of accomplishment that 
comes with cultivation. We must not let this 
opportunity or duty go to waste. 
While we continue to combat the dev-
astating effects of COVID–19, I urge citizens 
across our great nation to raise their spades 
and seeds, and join me in planting Victory 
Gardens. I urge my colleagues to support this 
important resolution.

RECOGNIZING MR. CALEB LYDICK 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to offer my sincerest gratitude to my con-
stituent, Mr. Caleb Lydick, for his heroic ac-
tions on April 7, 2020. 
On the afternoon of April 7, Missouri State 
Highway Patrol and deputies with the Mont-
gomery County Sheriff’s Office responded to 
the report of a shooting on eastbound Inter-
state 70, near the 175-mile marker, in Mont-
gomery County, Missouri. The initial investiga-
tion indicated the driver of a passenger car 
had fired shots from a moving vehicle, striking 
and disabling another vehicle also traveling 
eastbound, causing that vehicle to come to a 
rest near the 175-mile marker. Thankfully, no 
injuries were reported. 
Troopers subsequently learned that, after 
the victim’s vehicle came to a stop, two trac-
tor-trailer drivers parked their trucks around 
the van to shield it from additional gun fire. I 
later learned that Caleb Lydick, of Springerton, 
Illinois, was one of the courageous drivers 
who placed himself, and his truck, in harm’s 
way to protect the disabled van. Caleb’s ac-
tions that day were both courageous and self-
less, and I am grateful for the men and 
women, like Caleb, who rise to the occasion in 
a moment of danger. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Caleb for his brav-
ery and wish him safe travels as he continues 
his essential work.

XAVIER BANKS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Xavier Banks 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Xavier Banks is a student at Arvada K–8 
and received this award because his deter-
mination and hard work have allowed him to 
overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Xavier 
Banks is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Xa-
vier Banks for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS 
OF 
HARMONY 
PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
THE CORONAVIRUS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend Harmony Public School for their 
efforts to protect our hospital heroes on the 
front lines fighting the coronavirus. 
As COVID–19 has rocked our communities 
and pushed our hospitals into overdrive, our 
healthcare professionals have faced a critical 
shortage of personal protective equipment, or 
PPE, such as face masks and rubber gloves. 
PPE provides critical protection for our doctors 
and nurses, shielding them from diseases like 
coronavirus and other biohazards. 
Seeing our heroes needing help, Harmony 
Public School used their 3–D printer to create 
2,000 plastic face shields over the course of 
six weeks, using modern technology to help 
medical professionals working to save lives. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, we send our sincerest 
thanks to the men and women at Harmony 
Public School for doing their part to help our 
community during these challenging times.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LAUREN 
OF MATHENY 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Lauren Matheny of Greens-
boro, North Carolina. 
Lauren was born on March 30, 1971 in 
Gainesville, Florida and spent many of her 
early years in Ormond Beach. 
Beyond being a devoted wife, loving mother, 
and friend to many, Lauren was a proud 
teacher at Holy Trinity Episcopal Day School 
in Greensboro. Words cannot do justice to the 
impact she had on so many students’ lives. 
In 2018, Lauren was diagnosed with pan-
creatic cancer. From that time on, she coura-
geously fought against her ailment with deter-
mination and dignity. Lauren set an example 
in her battle against cancer that will live on for 
years to come. 
As an educator, she enriched the lives of 
her students, her children, and so many in the 
community. Evidence of this enrichment was 
demonstrated when over 300 members of her 
community came together to organize a fund-
raiser on behalf of the Matheny family. 
On April 8, 2020, Lauren passed away with 
her family by her side. Her contributions will 
not soon be forgotten. 
Please join me in gratitude for Lauren’s life 
and in praying for her husband, Zack, her 
three children, and the entire Matheny family.

HON. JAMES A. HIMES

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E380 
April 22, 2020 
that of an impactful leader and my good 
friend, Stamford’s own Jack Bryant. Jack’s 
quiet dignity and ebullient approachability 
belied the immense work he accomplished 
throughout his life, whether most recently as a 
member on the Board of Education, his long 
service in the Stamford NAACP, including as 
its president, as a deacon at Faith Tabernacle 
Missionary Baptist Church and involved com-
munity volunteer, and as a beloved father and 
family member. Whenever you needed some-
thing good for the community done, you didn’t 
have to go to Jack. He was already there, and 
he welcomed your help with open arms. 
Education and opportunity animated Jack. 
When he ran for Board of Education, he spoke 
movingly of his own education at Stamford’s 
Westhill High, and watching his children 
achieve their own success. He dedicated his 
time and energy to removing the barriers too 
often found preventing educational attainment, 
particularly in communities of color. He did this 
civically, frequently coming to the Board of 
Education and Stamford’s city government to 
testify and participate, and he did it through 
example in the community, leading local high 
school student visits to Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities for decades. Jack made 
sure these trips built more than resumes; they 
built character. Jack demonstrated how these 
young men and women could grow with the 
opportunities present today and build even 
stronger communities in the future by investing 
their talents in the following generation. 
Nowhere was this more evident than his 
own family. One of those HBCU trips resulted 
in one daughter attending college at Howard 
University, then medical school. Today she is 
on the front lines of saving others from the 
devastating consequences of this pandemic. 
In her grief, his other daughter celebrates his 
life and encourages all in the community to 
follow in his footsteps. His son coaches at 
Stamford High, serving as the same kind of 
community role model that his father always 
did. And countless others are sharing their 
memories of ‘‘Uncle Jack,’’ and how we can 
all model our lives in his legacy. 
I worked most closely with Jack during his 
decade-long 
presidency 
of 
the 
Stamford 
NAACP, looking to achieve justice for those 
who too often lack it and making sure the 
least of ours in the community get what they 
need in a tough world. We’ve worked together 
to register and empower voters; to combat the 
scourge of gun violence that claims too many 
urban victims; to remedy the historic injustices 
of our criminal justice system; and of course to 
help the next generation seize opportunities to 
get a world-beating education and better un-
derstand and improve the world they will soon 
enter. 
Whenever we talked, I came away hopeful. 
Whenever we worked, I saw the grateful faces 
of those he served. Whenever we prayed, I 
knew Jack’s earnest and sincere pleas flew up 
to the heavens above. 
This world has lost a great leader, and that 
leader left a great legacy. I dedicate today to 
mourning and remembrance, yes, but more so 
to furthering his legacy of service and sac-
rifice, uplifting those who follow in his path and 
commending the others so inspired to do so 
now. To help feed the hungry, as the number 
of those who hunger grows; to provide a bet-
ter future to the next generation, as the future 
grows more perilous; and to always keep fight-
ing for justice and equality for all. May we all 
be even half as successful at Jack Bryant was 
at leaving the world a better place than we 
found it and loving our neighbor even more 
than ourselves.

THOMAS WALLACE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Thomas Wal-
lace for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. Thom-
as Wallace is a student at Three Creeks K–8 
and received this award because his deter-
mination and hard work have allowed him to 
overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Thomas 
Wallace is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Thomas Wallace for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PASTOR 
JOSEPH OWES 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, it is with a heavy heart that I stand here 
today to announce that on April 2, we lost 
Pastor Joseph Owes of Pomona, California, to 
complications with COVID–19. Pastor Owes 
devoted 20 years of his life to providing hope 
and inspiration to the people of Pomona. 
A Georgia native, Pastor Owes spent his 
formative elementary and junior high school 
years in the South, experiencing desegrega-
tion firsthand. As difficult as those times were, 
they taught Pastor Owes to ‘‘outlast the 
enemy’’ and forgive quickly. He immersed 
himself in football, earning an MVP award and 
27 college scholarship offers. Eventually he 
landed on Texas Southern University, where 
he majored in mechanical engineering. After 
graduating, Pastor Owes worked hard in sales 
and management for five Fortune 500 Compa-
nies and married the love of his life, Michele 
Lipkins, in 1986. Together they raised four lov-
ing children. 
Eventually, Pastor Owes found his way to 
preaching in 1989 and completed his ministe-
rial training, receiving his ordination under the 
leadership of his mentor and friend, Pastor 
Reuben L. Monmouth II. Pastor Owes used 
his talents of bringing people together to start 
a church inside a maximum-security prison in 
Texas. There he mentored trustees and 
helped prepare them for the outside world. He 
later established a church and Christian 
School in Southwest Houston. 
In February of 2000, Pastor Owes accepted 
an assignment to pastor From the Heart 
Church Ministries of Pomona, serving as a pil-
lar of inspiration and guidance for the commu-
nity. During the economic crash of 2009, he 
was instrumental in bringing badly needed 
service to the Pomona Valley, using his 
church to host food banks and health fairs, 
and provide job and financial literacy work-
shops for those struggling with foreclosures. I 
was fortunate to have met him and partner 
with him in providing these services to our 
community. 
Pastor Owes enjoyed the outdoors and 
working with his hands to create things like 
slingshots and bow and arrows. He often 
played racquetball, rode his bicycle, and par-
ticipated in competitive bowling with his sons. 
His friends and family called him the ‘‘Grill 
Master’’ as he often cooked large meals for 
his loved ones. One of his greatest joys was 
spending time with his family and having all 
the children and grandchildren together under 
one roof. 
For his exemplary life, Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor to recognize Pastor Joseph Owes. 
His decades of service and contributions to 
our community are worthy of admiration, and 
his memory will live on through the countless 
lives he has impacted. Pastor Owes is sur-
vived by his wife of 22 years, Michele, their 
four children, six grandchildren, and a host of 
other family and friends. May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING 
FORWARD 
SCIENCE’S 
CONTRIBUTION 
TO 
FIGHTING THE CORONAVIRUS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend Forward Science, one of our 
many businesses in TX–22 for their efforts to 
aid those on the front lines fighting against 
coronavirus. 
As our Houston hospital heroes face down 
the coronavirus pandemic, they need to stay 
healthy so that they can help others fighting to 
overcome this disease. Hand sanitizer plays a 
critical safety role in this fight, but our hos-
pitals have faced a medical supply shortage. 
Like many regions across the nation, our 
Houston hospitals faced a dire shortage of 
personal protective equipment or PPE’s. Doc-
tors and nurses have been forced to improvise 
and use their own makeshift PPE’s, turning to 
raincoats and swim goggles to protect them 
from the coronavirus because the supply of 
masks and gowns was depleted. 
TX–22 comes together to face challenges 
head on. Forward Science, an oral healthcare 
products company out of Stafford, Texas, has 
joined other companies in shifting their pro-
duction to provide a needed supply of hand 
sanitizer for our healthcare heroes. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, we extend our deep 
gratitude to Forward Science for their com-
mendable actions filling the gap and helping 
our healthcare professionals at this critical 
time.

HONORING 
THE 
SACRIFICE 
OF 
SERGEANT GARY LEE MCKIDDY 
ON 6 MAY 1970 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the heroism of Sergeant Gary 
Lee McKiddy of Ohio, who valiantly sacrificed 
his life on May 6, 1970, during the Cambodian 
invasion in the Vietnam War. 
During the May 1970 incursion in Cam-
bodia, then-Specialist McKiddy was assigned 
to the 1st Cavalry Division as a crew chief/ 
door gunner on a single-engine ‘‘scout’’ heli-
copter. On May 6, McKiddy was sent to Cam-
bodia alongside friend and observer Jim 
Skaggs and Warrant Officer Tom Whiddon, 
the pilot, to identify and attack enemy strong-
holds. While on patrol, the helicopter was 
struck by enemy fire, causing the transmission 
line to burst and the helicopter to make a 
crash landing. 
Based on the account of survivor Skaggs as 
well as the accounts of the medical evacuation 
team, all three men survived the initial crash. 
McKiddy, who was thrown from the helicopter, 
bravely and heroically charged back into the 
burning crash in an attempt to save both fel-
low crew members. After successfully rescuing 
Skaggs, McKiddy was killed while trying to 
save his pilot, Warrant Officer Whiddon. On 
June 24, 1970, McKiddy was posthumously 
awarded the Silver Star, the third-highest per-
sonal decoration for valor in the United States 
Armed Forces. 
As we remember Sergeant Gary McKiddy 
on the 50th anniversary of his heroic sacrifice, 
I am drawn to John 15:13, which says, ‘‘Great-
er love hath no man than this, that a man lay 
down his life for his friends.’’ Gary’s actions 
that morning are a true example of gallantry 
and belief in the Warrior Ethos. I am confident 
that God was with Gary that morning and that 
Gary is with Him now in His heavenly king-
dom. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and con-
stituent Jim Skaggs for sharing this story with 
me and for continuing to honor the legacy of 
his fallen friend. We remember Sergeant Gary 
McKiddy for his bravery, and I pray for his 
friends and family on this special anniversary. 
VIOLA GARCIA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Viola Garcia 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Viola Garcia is a student at Oberon Middle 
School and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Viola Gar-
cia is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Viola 
Garcia for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassador for Youth award. I have 
no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication 
and character in all of her future accomplish-
ments.

HONORING THE MILITARY SERV-
ICE OF BUTCH, GUY, CLOYD, AND 
PETE STAFFORD 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the military service of Butch, Guy, 
Cloyd, and Pete Stafford. These brothers 
served our country for a combined 73 years. 
Raised in the Bell Orchard community of 
Guilford County, North Carolina, the Stafford 
brothers farmed and worked the land, at-
tended Jesse Wharton and Rankin Schools, 
and were members of Hillcrest Baptist Church. 
It didn’t take long after turning 18 for any of 
these brothers to begin their service to our 
country. 
Cloyd served eight years in the National 
Guard, Pete served 21 years in the National 
Guard, Butch served 22 and a half years in 
the Navy, and Guy served 21 and a half years 
in the Navy. 
It’s not often that you come across a family 
so devoted to service to America, which rep-
resents a piece of history larger than any one 
person. It shows a powerful belief and dedica-
tion to our country’s bedrock principles of 
service, selflessness, and sacrifice. I’m thank-
ful for their devotion to the United States. 
There’s no question that the Stafford brothers 
set an example and passed down a legacy to 
their children and grandchildren that will live 
on for generations to come. 
Please join me in gratitude for the Stafford 
brothers, who honorably served their country 
and have continued to be steward citizens in 
our community.

COMMENDING JACKSON GOODMAN 
FOR HIS SUPPORT OF MOTHERS 
& FAMILIES 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 22, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize an incredible young man in TX– 
22. Jackson Goodman is a ten-year-old fourth 
grader at Epiphany Catholic School who at a 
young age is already making a sincere impact 
in our community. 
Jackson has been gathering diapers and 
baby wipes through diaper drives for the past 
two Lenten seasons to help the Pregnancy 
Help Center. This needed center gives con-
fidential and free care to people with un-
planned pregnancies. 
In his first year collecting donations, Jack-
son gave the Pregnancy Help Center almost 
two thousand diapers. He more than tripled 
that contribution the following year, donating 
over 6,900 diapers. This year, Jackson was 
able to donate over 7,000 diapers and almost 
10,400 baby wipes to the Pregnancy Help 
Center. 
These supplies may seem like an easy gro-
cery store grab, but for some mothers and 
families they are a needed—and expensive— 
commodity. 
And, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, they are harder to get 
than ever. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, we commend Jackson 
Goodman: an impressive young man who 
more than lives up to his last name.
