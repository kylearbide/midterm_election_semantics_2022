PRAYER 
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Cap-
itol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered 
the following prayer: 
Heavenly Father, this morning we 
pause to remember Your humble serv-
ant, 
91-year-old 
Holocaust 
survivor 
Rabbi Romi Cohn, who lost his life this 
week and who just 2 months ago, at 
this very dais, as a guest chaplain, 
marked the 75th anniversary of his 
Auschwitz liberation. 
May his memory be a blessing. 
Lord, where can we run to hide from 
an enemy we cannot see? 
On 9/11, we saw its hand: the planes 
crashing the towers, the clouds of dust 
covering its victims, no tests needed. 
Those fortunate could flee, but not 
now, not today. So are we all, as it 
might seem, trapped above the 93rd 
floor? No, we have a place to run. 
So let our hearts be comforted from 
the words of David’s psalm. We have a 
place to run, to that rock that is high-
er than us all, a tabernacle from the 
storm, our Jehovah Shalom, our Jeho-
vah Jireh, an everlasting tower and a 
strength from our enemies. 
We have a rock. He is our God, a 
place to hide. 
These things I pray in Jesus’ name. 
Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 7(a) of House Resolution 
891, the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. NEGUSE led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

appropriate for all borrowers; and

this Act, the Administration should encourage 
lenders to provide payment deferments, when 
appropriate, and to extend the maturity of cov-
ered loans, so as to avoid balloon payments or 
any requirement for increases in debt payments 
resulting from deferments provided by lenders 
during the period of the national emergency de-
clared by the President under the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with re-
spect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID– 
19).

after the deferment period; and

ing the period beginning on the date of enact-
ment of this Act and ending on the date that is 
6 months after such date of enactment, for the

due on the covered loan.

(1) on a covered loan not later than 30 days 
after the date on which the first such payment 
is due.

made by the Administrator under paragraph (1) 
shall be applied to the covered loan such that

that amount. 
(d) OTHER
REQUIREMENTS.—The Adminis-
trator shall— 
(1) communicate and coordinate with the Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency, and State 
bank regulators to encourage those entities to 
not require lenders to increase their reserves on 
account of receiving payments made by the Ad-
ministrator under subsection (c); 
(2) waive statutory limits on maximum loan 
maturities for any covered loan durations where 
the lender provides a deferral and extends the 
maturity of covered loans during the 1-year pe-
riod following the date of enactment of this Act;

cause of the potential of higher volumes, travel 
restrictions, and the inability to access some 
properties during the COVID–19 pandemic, ex-
tend lender site visit requirements to—

tended at the discretion of the Administration)

fault. 
(e) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
section may be construed to limit the authority 
of the Administrator to make payments pursu-
ant to subsection (c) with respect to a covered 
loan solely because the covered loan has been 
sold in the secondary market. 
(f) AUTHORIZATION
OF
APPROPRIATIONS.—

Administrator $17,000,000,000 to carry out this

‘‘(II) determining whether a change to a con-
dition of use of a drug is generally recognized as 
safe and effective under section 201(p)(1), ex-
empt from section 503(b)(1), and not required to

of such order. 
‘‘(iii) DRUGS DESCRIBED.—The drugs described

‘‘(I) specified in subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or 
(a)(3);

‘‘(ii) subject to a final order under this sec-
tion; or 
‘‘(iii) subject to a final sunscreen order (as de-

DEMONSTRATING
PRIMA 
FACIE
SAFE
NONPRESCRIPTION
MARKETING
AND 
USE.—Information specified in this subpara-
graph, with respect to a request described in 
subparagraph (A)(i), is— 
‘‘(i) information sufficient for a prima facie 
demonstration that the drug subject to such re-
quest has a verifiable history of being marketed 
and safely used by consumers in the United 
States as a nonprescription drug under com-
parable conditions of use; 
‘‘(ii) if the drug has not been previously mar-
keted in the United States as a nonprescription 
drug, information sufficient for a prima facie 
demonstration that the drug was marketed and 
safely used under comparable conditions of mar-
keting and use in a country listed in section 
802(b)(1)(A) or designated by the Secretary in 
accordance with section 802(b)(1)(B)— 
‘‘(I) for such period as needed to provide rea-
sonable assurances concerning the safe non-
prescription use of the drug; and 
‘‘(II) during such time was subject to suffi-
cient monitoring by a regulatory body consid-
ered acceptable by the Secretary for such moni-
toring purposes, including for adverse events as-
sociated with nonprescription use of the drug; 
or 
‘‘(iii) if the Secretary determines that informa-
tion described in clause (i) or (ii) is not needed 
to provide a prima facie demonstration that the 
drug can be safely marketed and used as a non-
prescription drug, such other information the 
Secretary determines is sufficient for such pur-
poses. 
‘‘(D) MARKETING PURSUANT TO NEW DRUG AP-
PLICATION.—In the case of a request described in 
subparagraph (A)(ii), the drug subject to such 
request may be resubmitted for filing only if—

riod as the Secretary determines appropriate 
(not to exceed 5 consecutive years) pursuant to 
an application approved under section 505; and 
‘‘(ii) during such period, 1,000,000 retail pack-
ages of the drug, or an equivalent quantity as 
determined by the Secretary, were distributed 
for retail sale, as determined in such manner as 
the Secretary finds appropriate.

OF
APPLICATION.—Except in the 
case of a request involving a drug described in

‘‘(c) PROCEDURE FOR MINOR CHANGES.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Minor changes in the dos-
age form of a drug that is described in para-
graph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) or the subject 
of an order issued under subsection (b) may be 
made by a requestor without the issuance of an 
order under subsection (b) if— 
‘‘(A) the requestor maintains such information 
as is necessary to demonstrate that the change— 
‘‘(i) will not affect the safety or effectiveness 
of the drug; and 
‘‘(ii) will not materially affect the extent of 
absorption or other exposure to the active ingre-
dient in comparison to a suitable reference prod-
uct; and 
‘‘(B) the change is in conformity with the re-
quirements of an applicable administrative order 
issued by the Secretary under paragraph (3). 
‘‘(2) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.— 
‘‘(A) ACCESS
TO
RECORDS.—A sponsor shall 
submit records requested by the Secretary relat-
ing to such a minor change under section 
704(a)(4), within 15 business days of receiving 
such a request, or such longer period as the Sec-
retary may provide. 
‘‘(B) INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION.—If the Sec-
retary determines that the information con-
tained in such records is not sufficient to dem-
onstrate that the change does not affect the 
safety or effectiveness of the drug or materially 
affect the extent of absorption or other exposure 
to the active ingredient, the Secretary— 
‘‘(i) may so inform the sponsor of the drug in 
writing; and 
‘‘(ii) if the Secretary so informs the sponsor, 
shall provide the sponsor of the drug with a rea-
sonable opportunity to provide additional infor-
mation. 
‘‘(C) FAILURE TO SUBMIT SUFFICIENT INFORMA-
TION.—If the sponsor fails to provide such addi-
tional information within a time prescribed by 
the Secretary, or if the Secretary determines 
that such additional information does not dem-
onstrate that the change does not— 
‘‘(i) affect the safety or effectiveness of the 
drug; or 
‘‘(ii) materially affect the extent of absorption 
or other exposure to the active ingredient in 
comparison to a suitable reference product, 
the drug as modified is a new drug under sec-
tion 201(p) and shall be deemed to be mis-
branded under section 502(ee). 
‘‘(3) DETERMINING WHETHER A CHANGE WILL 
AFFECT SAFETY OR EFFECTIVENESS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall issue 
one or more administrative orders specifying re-
quirements for determining whether a minor 
change made by a sponsor pursuant to this sub-
section will affect the safety or effectiveness of 
a drug or materially affect the extent of absorp-
tion or other exposure to an active ingredient in 
the drug in comparison to a suitable reference 
product, together with guidance for applying 
those orders to specific dosage forms. 
‘‘(B) STANDARD PRACTICES.—The orders and 
guidance issued by the Secretary under sub-
paragraph (A) shall take into account relevant 
public standards and standard practices for 
evaluating the quality of drugs, and may take 
into account the special needs of populations, 
including children. 
‘‘(d) CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION SUB-
MITTED TO THE SECRETARY.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), 
any information, including reports of testing 
conducted on the drug or drugs involved, that is 
submitted by a requestor in connection with pro-
ceedings on an order under this section (includ-
ing any minor change under subsection (c)) and 
is a trade secret or confidential information sub-
ject to section 552(b)(4) of title 5, United States 
Code, or section 1905 of title 18, United States 
Code, shall not be disclosed to the public unless 
the requestor consents to that disclosure. 
‘‘(2) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in sub-
paragraph (B), the Secretary shall—

other person with respect to an order requested 
(or initiated by the Secretary) under subsection 
(b), available to the public upon such submis-
sion. 
‘‘(B) LIMITATIONS ON PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.— 
Information described in subparagraph (A) shall 
not be made public if— 
‘‘(i) the information pertains to pharma-
ceutical quality information, unless such infor-
mation is necessary to establish standards under 
which a drug is generally recognized as safe and 
effective under section 201(p)(1); 
‘‘(ii) the information is submitted in a re-
questor-initiated request, but the requestor 
withdraws such request, in accordance with 
withdrawal procedures established by the Sec-
retary, before the Secretary issues the proposed 
order; 
‘‘(iii) the Secretary requests and obtains the 
information under subsection (c) and such in-
formation is not submitted in relation to an 
order under subsection (b); or 
‘‘(iv) the information is of the type contained 
in raw datasets. 
‘‘(e) UPDATES
TO
DRUG
LISTING
INFORMA-
TION.—A sponsor who makes a change to a drug 
subject to this section shall submit updated drug 
listing information for the drug in accordance 
with section 510(j) within 30 calendar days of 
the date when the drug is first commercially 
marketed, except that a sponsor who was the 
order requestor with respect to an order subject 
to subsection (b)(5)(C) (or a licensee, assignee, 
or successor in interest of such requestor) shall 
submit updated drug listing information on or 
before the date when the drug is first commer-
cially marketed. 
‘‘(f) APPROVALS

SECTION
505.—The 
provisions of this section shall not be construed 
to preclude a person from seeking or maintain-
ing the approval of an application for a drug 
under sections 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2), and 505(j). A 
determination under this section that a drug is 
not subject to section 503(b)(1), is generally rec-
ognized as safe and effective under section 
201(p)(1), and is not a new drug under section 
201(p) shall constitute a finding that the drug is 
safe and effective that may be relied upon for 
purposes of an application under section 
505(b)(2), so that the applicant shall be required 
to submit for purposes of such application only 
information needed to support any modification 
of the drug that is not covered by such deter-
mination under this section. 
‘‘(g) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE

tain, update (as determined necessary by the 
Secretary but no less frequently than annually),

terim final order in effect, including the com-
plete text of the order; and

‘‘(B) the Secretary’s expectations, if resources 
permit, for issuance of proposed orders over a 3- 
year period. 
‘‘(h) DEVELOPMENT ADVICE TO SPONSORS OR 
REQUESTORS.—The Secretary shall establish 
procedures under which sponsors or requestors 
may meet with appropriate officials of the Food 
and Drug Administration to obtain advice on 
the studies and other information necessary to 
support submissions under this section and 
other matters relevant to the regulation of non-
prescription drugs and the development of new 
nonprescription drugs under this section. 
‘‘(i) PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE SPONSORS OR 
REQUESTORS.—The Secretary shall establish 
procedures to facilitate efficient participation by 
multiple sponsors or requestors in proceedings 
under this section, including provision for joint 
meetings with multiple sponsors or requestors or 
with organizations nominated by sponsors or re-
questors to represent their interests in a pro-
ceeding. 
‘‘(j) ELECTRONIC
FORMAT.—All submissions 
under this section shall be in electronic format. 
‘‘(k) EFFECT ON EXISTING REGULATIONS GOV-
ERNING NONPRESCRIPTION DRUGS.— 
‘‘(1) REGULATIONS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY 
TO
NONPRESCRIPTION
DRUGS.—Except as pro-
vided in this subsection, nothing in this section 
supersedes regulations establishing general re-
quirements for nonprescription drugs, including 
regulations of general applicability contained in 
parts 201, 250, and 330 of title 21, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations, or any successor regulations.

regulations by means of rulemaking in accord-
ance with section 553 of title 5, United States 
Code.

MENTS FOR SPECIFIC NONPRESCRIPTION DRUGS.— 
‘‘(A) The provisions of section 310.545 of title

under subsection (b). 
‘‘(B) Regulations in effect on the day before 
the date of the enactment of this section, estab-
lishing requirements for specific nonprescription 
drugs marketed pursuant to this section (includ-
ing such requirements in parts 201 and 250 of 
title 21, Code of Federal Regulations), shall be 
deemed to be final orders under subsection (b), 
only as they apply to drugs— 
‘‘(i) subject to paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of 
subsection (a); or 
‘‘(ii) otherwise subject to an order under this 
section. 
‘‘(3) WITHDRAWAL OF REGULATIONS.—The Sec-
retary shall withdraw regulations establishing 
final monographs and the procedures governing 
the over-the-counter drug review under part 330 
and other relevant parts of title 21, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations (as in effect on the day before 
the date of the enactment of this section), or 
make technical changes to such regulations to 
ensure conformity with appropriate terminology 
and cross references. Notwithstanding sub-
chapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States 
Code, 
any 
such 
withdrawal

originated by a financial institution in the ordi-
nary course of business, or a securities or cap-

(ii) RESTRICTIONS.—The Secretary may make a 
loan, loan guarantee, or other investment under 
subsection (b)(4) as part of a program or facility

not to repurchase an equity security that is list-
ed on a national securities exchange of the eligi-
ble business or any parent company of the eligi-

standing, except to the extent required under a

ments under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve 
Act (12 U.S.C. 343(3)), including requirements 
relating to loan collateralization, taxpayer pro-
tection, and borrower solvency, shall apply with 
respect to any program or facility described in 
subsection (b)(4). 
(C) UNITED STATES BUSINESSES.—A program or 
facility in which the Secretary makes a loan, 
loan guarantee, or other investment under sub-
section (b)(4) shall only purchase obligations or

is not higher than 2 percent per annum. For the 
first 6 months after any such direct loan is 
made, or for such longer period as the Secretary 
may determine in his discretion, no principal or 
interest shall be due and payable. Any eligible 
borrower applying for a direct loan under this

the loan request to support the ongoing oper-

at least 90 percent of the recipient’s workforce, 
at full compensation and benefits, until Sep-

gency declared by the Secretary of Health and

the United States or under the laws of the 
United States and has significant operations in 
and a majority of its employees based in the 
United States; 
(VII) the recipient will not pay dividends with 
respect to the common stock of the eligible busi-
ness, or repurchase an equity security that is

the extent required under a contractual obliga-
tion that is in effect as of the date of enactment 
of this Act; 
(VIII) the recipient will not outsource or off-
shore jobs for the term of the loan and 2 years

PROTECTIVE
EQUIPMENT
AND 
TEST KITS.— 
(A) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(i) There is an urgent need for personal pro-
tective equipment and test kits to the Bureau 
based on the density of the inmate population, 
the high traffic, the high volume of inmates, the 
high rate of turnover of inmates and personnel, 
and the number of high-security areas, within 
the facilities of the Bureau. 
(ii) The inability of the Bureau to secure the 
purchase of infectious disease personal protec-
tive equipment and related supplies now and in 
the future is a vulnerability. 
(iii) The Bureau is currently competing in and 
engaging the same landscape of vendors as all 
other Federal agencies and private entities. 
(iv) The ability of the Bureau to purchase 
needed equipment and supplies is currently sub-
ject to an individual manufacturer’s specific 
recognition of the Bureau as a priority and sub-
sequent allocation of the inventory of the manu-
facturer to the Bureau. 
(B) CONSIDERATION.—The Secretary shall ap-
propriately consider, relative to other priorities 
of the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices for high-risk and high-need populations,

protective equipment and COVID–19 test kits to 
the Bureau for use by inmates and personnel of 
the Bureau.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY RELIEF AUTHORITY FOR 
THE REGISTER OF COPYRIGHTS 
SEC. 19011. (a) AMENDMENT.—Chapter 7 of 
title 17, United States Code, is amended by add-
ing at the end the following: 
‘‘§ 710. Emergency relief authority 
‘‘(a) EMERGENCY ACTION.—If, on or before De-
cember 31, 2021, the Register of Copyrights de-
termines that a national emergency declared by 
the President under the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) generally disrupts or 
suspends the ordinary functioning of the copy-
right system under this title, or any component 
thereof, including on a regional basis, the Reg-
ister may, on a temporary basis, toll, waive, ad-
just, or modify any timing provision (including 
any deadline or effective period, except as pro-
vided in subsection (c)) or procedural provision 
contained in this title or chapters II or III of 
title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, for no 
longer than the Register reasonably determines 
to be appropriate to mitigate the impact of the 
disruption caused by the national emergency. In 
taking such action, the Register shall consider 
the scope and severity of the particular national 
emergency, and its specific effect with respect to 
the particular provision, and shall tailor any 
remedy accordingly. 
‘‘(b) NOTICE AND EFFECT.—Any action taken 
by the Register in response to a national emer-
gency pursuant to subsection (a) shall not be 
subject to section 701(e) or subchapter II of 
chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, and 
chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The pro-
vision of general public notice detailing the ac-
tion being taken by the Register in response to 
the national emergency under subsection (a) is 
sufficient to effectuate such action. The Register 
may make such action effective both prospec-
tively and retroactively in relation to a par-
ticular provision as the Register determines to be 
appropriate based on the timing, scope, and na-
ture of the public emergency, but any action by 
the Register may only be retroactive with re-
spect to a deadline that has not already passed 
before the declaration described in subsection 
(a). 
‘‘(c) STATEMENT REQUIRED.—Except as pro-
vided in subsection (d), not later than 20 days 
after taking any action that results in a provi-
sion being modified for a cumulative total of 
longer than 120 days, the Register shall submit 
to Congress a statement detailing the action 
taken, the relevant background, and rationale 
for the action. 
‘‘(d) EXCEPTIONS.—The authority of the Reg-
ister to act under subsection (a) does not extend 
provisions under this title requiring the com-
mencement of an action or proceeding in Fed-
eral court within a specified period of time, ex-
cept that if the Register adjusts the license 
availability date defined in section 115(e)(15), 
such adjustment shall not affect the ability to 
commence actions for any claim of infringement 
of exclusive rights provided by paragraphs (1) 
and (3) of section 106 against a digital music 
provider arising from the unauthorized repro-
duction or distribution of a musical work by 
such digital music provider in the course of en-
gaging in covered activities that accrued after 
January 1, 2018, provided that such action is 
commenced within the time periods prescribed 
under section 115(d)(10)(C)(i) or 115(d)(10)(C)(ii) 
as calculated from the adjusted license avail-
ability date. If the Register adjusts the license 
availability date, the Register must provide the 
statement to Congress under subsection (c) at 
the same time as the public notice of such ad-
justment with a detailed explanation of why 
such adjustment is needed. 
‘‘(e) COPYRIGHT TERM EXCEPTION.—The au-
thority of the Register to act under subsection 
(a) does not extend to provisions under chapter 
3, except section 304(c), or section 1401(a)(2). 
‘‘(f) OTHER LAWS.—Notwithstanding section 
301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
1631), the authority of the Register under sub-
section (a) is not contingent on a specification 
made by the President under such section or 
any other requirement under that Act (other 
than the emergency declaration under section 
201(a) of such Act (50 U.S.C. 1621(a))). The au-
thority described in this section supersedes the 
authority of title II of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.).’’. 
(b) TECHNICAL
AND
CONFORMING
AMEND-
MENT.—The table of sections for chapter 7 of 
title 17, United States Code, is amended by add-
ing at the end the following: 
‘‘710. Emergency relief authority.’’. 
(c) EMERGENCY REQUIREMENT.—The amount 
provided by this section is designated by the 
Congress as being for an emergency requirement 
pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985.

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. Hoyer moves that the House concur in 
the Senate amendment to H.R. 748. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 911, the mo-
tion is debatable for 3 hours, equally 
divided and controlled by the majority 
leader and the minority leader or their 
respective designees. The gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER) and the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY) 
each will control 90 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and insert extra-
neous material on the matter under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 1 minute. 
Mr. Speaker, we meet at a chal-
lenging time in our country and in the 
global community. This session will be 
different than most, where we come to-
gether and reach out our hands. We hug 
one another in affection and thanks for 
the collegial work with us on the peo-
ple’s business. 
People who can see the Chamber now 
will see that we are keeping distance 
from one another, not out of hostility, 
but out of love for one another, that we 
may keep one another healthy and 
safe. It will, therefore, be an unusual 
session, but a critical session. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation rep-
resents a bipartisan resolve to meet 
the coronavirus challenge head-on. It 
represents a focus on families and 
workers, with the objective of making 
them 
safer 
and 
economically 
sup-
ported. It will protect workers and 
their families in our economy as we all 
do our part to flatten the curve. 
Public health officials have made it 
clear that the only chance we have to 
prevent our healthcare system from 
being overwhelmed by this pandemic, 
as it is threatened to be, is for as many 
Americans to stay home as possible. 
It is, however, necessary for us to be 
here to pass legislation to respond on 
behalf of the American people to this 
daunting challenge. 
The closure means that large parts of 
our economy must be temporarily shut

H1819 
March 27, 2020 
down, causing severe disruption for 
businesses and workers. We saw the im-
pact of this yesterday, when new unem-
ployment insurance claims increased 
by more than 3 million people, 3 mil-
lion individuals, 3 million who are in 
families who rely on them for support 
and contributions to the support of 
their families and their children. 
Today, the House is taking action on 
phase three of our response to this un-
precedented challenge. 
We initially responded, Mr. Speaker, 
to the immediate need of our Nation 
with $8.3 billion in appropriations to 
meet the immediate health needs of 
our people. 
A little over 2 weeks ago, we acted to 
meet the continuing health and eco-
nomic needs of our people. That was 
phase two. 
This bill, Mr. Speaker, which is phase 
three of our effort, will increase unem-
ployment insurance benefits to those 
furloughed or laid off while expanding 
eligibility to include the self-employed 
and contract workers, and send checks 
to most Americans to help them get 
through this difficult period. 
Mr. Speaker, I am personally dis-
appointed that Senate Republicans in-
sisted on shortchanging the 700,000 peo-
ple of the District of Columbia by $700 
million, treating the District as a ter-
ritory and not as a State for the pur-
poses of allocating stabilization funds, 
as is so often the case. This jeopardizes 
the entire national capital region as we 
work 
together 
to 
prevent 
further 
spread of coronavirus. 
I will be working with Delegate 
Holmes Norton and our colleagues to 
enact legislation correcting this injus-
tice, and I look forward to working 
with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to accomplish that objective. 
As the number of coronavirus cases 
in our country rises above 85,000 of our 
fellow citizens and continues to in-
crease exponentially, we must take 
swift action to ensure that people can 
stay home to slow the spread of this 
deadly virus, and that our economy can 
be supported so that it can rebound 
when the medical experts and sci-
entists say it is safe to do so. 
I thank the Speaker and the com-
mittee chairs who have worked tire-
lessly to bring this agreement to fru-
ition, 
including 
Chairwoman 
NITA 
LOWEY, 
Chairman 
FRANK
PALLONE, 
Chairman RICHARD
NEAL, Chairman 
BOBBY SCOTT, Chairman PETER DEFA-
ZIO, Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS, as 
well as other chairs who have partici-
pated in forging this legislation with a 
bipartisan coalition in the United 
States Senate. 
I thank, as well, the extraordinary 
staff—the 
extraordinary 
staff—who 
have worked around the clock in a very 
short period of time, knowing full well 
the crisis that confronts us and that 
time is of the essence. 
Thank you, staff. 
The staff of each of our committees, 
our Members, and the leadership, the 
staffs of all three of those entities, and 
the 
Members 
have 
been 
working 
around the clock, literally, Mr. Speak-
er, around the clock to determine 
needs and priorities and meet them. 
The House continues to stand ready 
to take additional steps when and as 
they are needed to win this battle for 
the safety and health of our people and 
our Nation. 
Together, 
Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans, together, we Americans, we 
Americans will work together to do our 
part 
in 
fighting 
against 
the 
coronavirus. 
Mr. Speaker, all of us stand in awe 
and deep gratitude to the millions of 
Americans who have shown courage 
and commitment at this dangerous and 
challenging time: our doctors, our 
nurses, our medical personnel, our po-
lice, our firefighters, and our emer-
gency medical response teams; those 
keeping 
our 
pharmacies, 
grocery 
stores, gas stations, and other critical 
facilities open; and so many in the pri-
vate and public sectors who are daily 
showing up to serve the needs of their 
neighbors and fellow citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, they reflect the best of 
the ‘‘home of the brave.’’ It is in times 
like these that we remind the world 
and ourselves that we are truly one Na-
tion, under God, indivisible, working 
together to overcome the greatest 
challenge with the greatest resolve. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we gather this morning 
in an America battling the coronavirus 
on two fronts: medically and economi-
cally. 
Today’s vote is about saving lives 
and livelihoods, providing the urgent 
relief needed to keep workers on the 
job, helping those who have lost theirs, 
and preserving Main Street businesses 
so they can ride out this crisis and re-
bound strongly. 
In 20 short days, our economy has 
taken a hit like we have rarely seen in 
America’s history. Thankfully, due to 
President Trump and Republicans in 
Congress, America had the strongest 
economy in the world heading into this 
challenge. Still, Congress must act ag-
gressively and act together now to 
stem the economic damage. 
Senate Democrats, aided by Speaker 
PELOSI, unfortunately, delayed this bill 
for days and used this crisis to advance 
a frivolous political agenda. It failed, 
but the Senate found unanimous, if not 
perfect, common ground. 
This bill arms families with eco-
nomic support, tax rebates of $1,200 per 
person and $500 per child, to help them 
ride this out. We also make it easier 
for Americans to access their savings 
penalty-free and let seniors over 72 
keep their savings intact. 
Workers get unprecedented help. Un-
employment is being expanded by $250 
billion to make sure the self-employed, 
the contractor, the freelancer, the fur-
loughed, and the Uber driver all have a 
lifeline to ride out this crisis. We are 
temporarily increasing the size of un-
employment checks and lengthening 
them if more time is needed to get on 
your feet. 
We take unprecedented action to 
save America’s local businesses and 
their workers. Main Street businesses 
face a crushing cash-flow problem. 
Their 
customers 
have 
disappeared. 
They now face a cascading sequence of 
layoffs and closures. 
Through temporary tax relief and 
lending, this bill injects cash directly 
into our local businesses, small and 
large, to stop this cash-flow crisis. We 
focus on preserving business to pre-
serve jobs, to get them through these 
next few weeks. 
Businesses can keep their payroll 
taxes in their bank accounts this year, 
and quickly turn their mounting losses 
into tax relief so they have more cash 
on hand to keep workers and to sur-
vive. These two actions alone keep $500 
billion in our local economy. 
For small businesses, we offer fully 
guaranteed loans through your local 
banker, with the promise that if you 
keep your workers on the payroll, that 
portion of the loan will be forgiven. 
For larger and the most distressed 
businesses, 
we 
provide 
loans, 
too, 
knowing your survival is crucial to 
millions of American workers. 
These loans aren’t bailouts. They are 
given with oversight and repayment to 
companies that did nothing wrong but 
suffered collateral damage as a result 
of this virus. 
Finally, the new worker retention 
credit, championed by Ways and Means 
Republicans and Leader KEVIN MCCAR-
THY, is to help our local businesses 
keep workers on the job. For busi-
nesses closed or partially closed due to 
a government order that have seen 
their incomes drop by 50 percent or 
more, if they pay half of their workers’ 
salaries, we will pay the other half, up 
to $10,000, through this crisis. 
The 
sooner 
we 
lock 
down 
the 
coronavirus, the sooner we unlock this 
economy. To quicken that, we give our 
hospitals, doctors, nurses, nonprofits, 
and rural healthcare providers on the 
front lines over $140 billion in new re-
sources. 
We give unprecedented flexibility to 
telehealth. We increase by 20 percent 
reimbursements for coronavirus treat-
ments. We accelerate Medicare fund-
ing, and we give patients more flexi-
bility to use their health savings ac-
counts. 
Mr. Speaker, while no one will agree 
with every part of this rescue bill, we 
face a challenge rarely seen in Amer-
ica’s history. We must act now, or the 
toll on lives and livelihoods will be far 
greater. I strongly urge its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. NEAL), one of the senior 
Members of the Congress and the chair-
man of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1820 
March 27, 2020 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, we have 
been whisked here this morning in one 
of the grave challenges of our life-
times. 
Usually, in March, we talk about 
brackets. Well, the brackets this morn-
ing are clear. Those brackets are about 
the health of the American people and 
the economic security of the American 
family. 
This is not about corruption. This is 
not about military conflict. Certainly, 
it is not about malfeasance. 
Our country is weathering an unprec-
edented public health crisis that de-
mands an unprecedented response from 
the United States Government. I am 
really proud of the critical solutions 
our Ways and Means Committee col-
leagues and I contributed to this legis-
lation. 
This legislation could be called the 
families’ health and economic security 
stabilization act because that is what 
we are doing this morning, providing 
stability. 
The healthcare workers on the front 
lines of this crisis are being pushed to 
their limits, both financially and phys-
ically. They need more masks, tests, 
ventilators, and beds to combat this 
virus. This legislation will help them 
secure these fundamental resources 
with $100 billion in funding for hos-
pitals and our healthcare system. 
As we work to protect the health of 
all Americans, we are also focused on 
the health of our economy. Just yester-
day morning, we learned that this 
week’s 
unemployment 
claims 
sky-
rocketed by over 1,000 percent. 
As we face this record economic chal-
lenge, families need benefits that will 
allow them to cover essential expenses 
like food, rent, and medication. From 
the beginning of this crisis, Ways and 
Means Democrats have understood that 
expanding unemployed benefits must 
be a top priority. 
b 0920 
The additional $600 per week in un-
employment benefits that we fought 
for is the least we can do to help those 
who, through no fault of their own, find 
themselves without a paycheck. Simi-
larly, the direct infusion of $1,200 in 
cash for American adults whom we 
fought for will help families through 
these challenging times. 
We also fought to include provisions 
to shore up the financial health of 
small business and other struggling 
employers. We were adamant about the 
inclusion of the employee retention 
credit because we know that the Amer-
ican economy will bounce back from 
this, and employers who take action to 
keep their employees on the payroll 
should be rewarded. 
This legislation is the product of two 
very different sides coming together to 
protect the health and financial secu-
rity of all Americans in the face of this 
crisis. 
I thank the many Members on both 
sides of the aisle, and the Capitol, who 
have worked to get us to this bill this 
morning. I also thank my Ways and 
Means Committee staff who have been 
working around the clock since this 
crisis began and have provided the 
committee and the Congress with un-
paralleled 
technical 
expertise 
and 
counsel. They deserve our appreciation. 
We are facing this grave enemy in 
COVID–19. It is dark and uncertain 
times that we are witnessing today, 
but that is why we are here. We are 
here to fight for things that matter to 
America, to prioritize their health and 
economic well-being. 
We have a responsibility to take this 
bold action this morning so that our 
economy will keep going for workers 
and small business and to give families 
the peace of mind they can depend 
upon so that their government can help 
keep them whole in this crisis. 
That is what we did in this bill. 
There will be a phase four, which will 
be real stimulus as opposed, I think, to 
the stabilization effort we make today. 
We wish our colleagues and the 
American people the best at this time. 
Take care of one another. 
But I fully support this legislation 
being passed in a timely manner. That 
means this morning. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. WALDEN), who is the top Repub-
lican on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, this 
package is not the first response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, nor will it be the 
last. 
The American people expect us to set 
partisanship aside in times of crisis 
and do what is best for our country and 
for our constituents, and that is what 
we are doing today. 
We are helping healthcare providers 
on the front lines back home get the 
personal protective equipment they 
need and the medicines and medical de-
vices that will save the lives of their 
patients. We are helping people who 
have lost their jobs get a lifeline. We 
are helping our small businesses keep 
their workforce together. We are mak-
ing record investments into finding 
treatments and a cure. We are helping 
our State and local governments, too. 
We are all in this together. With 
President Trump’s leadership, we are 
all in this to win as fast as medically 
possible. 
In order to prevent our health system 
from collapsing under the weight of 
this virus, we are providing unprece-
dented 
support 
for 
our 
Nation’s 
healthcare providers, including $100 bil-
lion for hospitals, labs, doctors, and in-
creased reimbursement for treating 
COVID–19 patients. 
We will dramatically expand produc-
tion and distribution of medical sup-
plies by providing liability protections 
through the PREP Act for respirator 
manufacturers, providing $16 billion for 
the Strategic National Stockpile to 
procure medical countermeasures such 
as personal protective equipment and 
ventilators, and providing $11 billion 
for the manufacturing, production, and 
purchase 
of 
vaccines, 
therapeutics, 
diagnostics, and other items to address 
the Nation’s medical or preparedness 
needs. 
The CARES Act opens up the fastest 
computers in the world at our national 
laboratories for research and analysis 
related to the COVID–19 virus. We help 
EPA expedite the ability to get dis-
infectants to market more quickly to 
protect the public from COVID–19 and 
prevent its further spread. In a volatile 
oil market, the CARES Act smartly 
delays a mandatory 2020 sale of oil 
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
through 2022. 
Included in the package are improve-
ments to expand access to care through 
telehealth, including $200 million for 
the FCC for telehealth services and de-
vices and an expansion of telehealth 
services in the Medicare program. 
The package also extends vital Medi-
care, Medicaid, and public health pro-
grams, including community health 
centers, among many others, until No-
vember 30 this year. 
We mobilize the Nation’s health 
workforce by providing liability pro-
tections to those who provide volun-
teer medical services during the public 
health crisis and by standing up the 
Ready Reserve. 
We take steps to protect our medical 
supply chain, something that I hope 
the Congress will continue to work on 
after we pass this legislation today. 
Today’s phase three approach is the 
most comprehensive and robust re-
sponse to COVID–19 yet. Together, we 
are going to win this war. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), who is one of 
the leaders in this Congress on pro-
tecting families and children. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this historic bill. 
This is the biggest economic and 
health crisis the country has ever 
faced. Nurses and doctors are in inten-
sive care units trying to save our hu-
manity against this awful pandemic. 
This is the biggest governmental re-
sponse the country has ever seen to 
rescue people, the economy, and our 
healthcare system. 
It is necessary. The United States is 
now the epicenter of a global pan-
demic. Cases of the coronavirus are ris-
ing exponentially. 
To slow the spread of the contagion, 
serious measures of social distancing 
are underway. Schools are closing. 
Businesses are shuttering. Last week, 
more than 3 million filed for unemploy-
ment. 
So, the hour is dark. But today, Con-
gress is ready to help get families, 
workers, and the country to the dawn 
of recovery. For that, I commend 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Appropriations 
Chair NITA LOWEY, and all the Appro-
priations subcommittee chairs. Their 
leadership has been crucial in the 
progress that we were able to make for 
the people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1821 
March 27, 2020 
Had we passed our House bill, things 
would be different, but we managed to 
shape this package in a fundamental 
way. We secured a large investment in 
hospitals, health systems, and State 
and local governments; a profound in-
crease 
in 
unemployment 
insurance 
benefits; and a significant expansion in 
support for small businesses. We made 
rent, mortgage, and utility costs eligi-
ble for SBA loan forgiveness. 
As chair of the Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee, I am 
proud of the investments we have made 
for working people, for public health, 
and for our teachers and students. 
For health, we secured $140 billion for 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services; $4.3 billion for the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention to re-
spond to the pandemic; $945 million for 
the NIH to support research; $127 bil-
lion for our medical response effort; 
and important increases for seniors, 
those living with disabilities, and those 
struggling with mental health. 
For education, we secured $30 billion 
for the Department of Education, bil-
lions for elementary and secondary 
education, and billions to help colleges 
and universities confront the imme-
diate effects of the pandemic. 
While this funding is crucial, let me 
be clear: It is a start. 
For working people and families, we 
secured $3.5 billion for the Child Care 
and Development Block Grant and $360 
million for programs at the Depart-
ment of Labor. 
I am proud of the increases that 
other 
Appropriations 
subcommittee 
chairs have secured: millions to ensure 
the Economic Injury Disaster Loans; 
millions to assist firefighters and our 
first responders to secure personal pro-
tective equipment; $25 billion for pub-
lic transit to protect passengers and 
operators as they access essential serv-
ices; $5 billion for the Community De-
velopment Block Grant program, to 
help communities respond to economic 
and housing impacts; emergency fund-
ing for child nutrition programs; $4 bil-
lion for homeless grants; and $45 billion 
for FEMA disaster relief, providing as-
sistance to every single State that has 
declared an emergency. And we have 
provided relief to our Tribal organiza-
tions and to our territories. 
So, I embrace this historic bill. I 
know 
the 
Speaker, 
Appropriations 
Chairwoman LOWEY, and the com-
mittee chairs fought to include paid 
sick days, paid leave for all, increased 
food assistance, and a strengthened and 
fully refundable child tax credit and a 
young child tax credit. Soon, duty will 
call on us to take the next major bold 
steps in this crisis. 
I call on the House of Representa-
tives to support the relief that Ameri-
cans need. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT), who is the Republican 
leader of the Small Business Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time in 
our Nation’s history. People are wor-
ried about their health and that of 
their loved ones. They are wondering 
how long this new way of life will last. 
But people across our great Nation are 
coming together. 
I have seen the response in my own 
district, where yesterday would have 
been opening day, and the Cincinnati 
Reds remain undefeated. 
From the bold leadership of Ohio’s 
Governor Mike DeWine and Depart-
ment of Health Director Dr. Amy 
Acton to the brave healthcare workers 
on the front lines of facilities like the 
University of Cincinnati Medical Cen-
ter and the local companies that have 
volunteered to produce much-needed 
personal protective equipment, these 
men and women are heroes, risking 
their lives and livelihoods so that their 
fellow citizens may continue to live as 
comfortably and as normally as pos-
sible during this trying time. 
As the ranking member of the House 
Small Business Committee, I want to 
single out the contribution of this Na-
tion’s small businesses. To those that 
have had to temporarily close and 
those who have bravely stayed open to 
provide life-sustaining supplies, I want 
you to know that there is help in this 
bill. We have come together in this leg-
islation to help our entrepreneurs who 
so urgently need it. Small businesses 
and their employees often rise before 
the Sun and retire under the stars to 
ensure that their customers’ needs are 
met and often exceeded. 
Along the way, the Small Business 
Administration, or SBA, is charged 
with assisting the Nation’s smallest 
firms. When disaster strikes, the SBA 
helps businesses get back on their feet. 
As we face the unprecedented chal-
lenge of COVID–19 we must ensure that 
small businesses have the resources 
needed to weather that storm. They 
are being forced to make tough choices 
to protect themselves, their employees, 
and their customers. They are laying 
off staff who are like family to them, 
cutting hours when workers need them 
most and closing their doors after 
years or even decades of successful op-
eration. 
To alleviate these enormous pres-
sures, the CARES Act, this legislation, 
creates a new program specifically de-
signed to respond to the current crisis. 
That program, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, provides $350 billion for 
100 percent federally guaranteed loans 
for up to 8 weeks of assistance. These 
loans can be forgiven when used for 
payroll, interest on mortgage, rent, 
and utilities. 
The CARES Act also creates a 
deferment payment on current 7(a) 
loans. The SBA will pay all principal, 
interest, and fees for those small busi-
nesses for up to 6 months. These pay-
ment obligations will be completely 
forgiven and removed from a bor-
rower’s books. 
Finally, the bill permits small busi-
ness owners who have applied for an 
SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan to 
request in advance up to $10,000. 
I am grateful that we can help small 
businesses in this act. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
thanked each and every one of the 
chairs. None have worked harder than 
Mr. DEFAZIO from the State of Oregon. 
He is one of this country’s experts on 
transportation and the movement of 
goods and services so critical to our 
economy and so critical to the health 
of our people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this is an 
unprecedented challenge to the health 
and economic well-being of the United 
States of America, and I am proud to 
be a Member of the House today here 
to address this. 
There are numerous provisions of 
this bill with which I disagree, and I 
know there are numerous provisions 
that my Republican colleagues dis-
agree with, but let’s put it a little bit 
in perspective. 
After 9/11, we bailed out the airlines, 
and they got a bunch of cash. 
What did they do then? They de-
clared bankruptcy, and they preserved 
their assets—except not their most val-
uable assets. They screwed their em-
ployees. They lost their pensions; they 
lost their stock options; and they lost 
their jobs. 
I remember talking to a 55-year-old 
flight employee who had been flying 25 
years. She said: Now I have to fly 10 
more just to get the guaranteed pen-
sion at 35 percent of what I would have 
gotten. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
that 
can’t 
happen 
again. 
Then, in 2008, Hank Paulson came to 
us, and he said: Just give me the key to 
the Treasury, and I will take care of 
this. 
Well, for 1 day in the House of Rep-
resentatives, we stood strong, and we 
defeated that. Two days later, we came 
back with something a little bit better 
but nowhere near adequate. 
We need to learn from those mis-
takes. That was supposed to save peo-
ple’s homes and their jobs. Millions 
lost their homes, their jobs, and their 
pensions. But Wall Street, hey, they 
prospered. 
Never again. 
We started a week ago with Sec-
retary Mnuchin proposing the same 
thing that Hank Paulson proposed— 
they all come from Wall Street—a cou-
ple of decades ago. 
The Democrats fought back. We said: 
No, it is going to be workers and fami-
lies first. 
This is a different kind of recovery 
package. It is an ultimate bipartisan 
product. It passed the Senate unani-
mously, and it emphasizes payrolls— 
maintaining payrolls and maintaining 
benefits. It is going to get help to small 
businesses, from individual owners to 
larger businesses. It is going to target

people with extended and enhanced un-
employment benefits. Some who work 
in the gig economy wouldn’t be eligible 
for anything. They are totally out. 
So, these are really good things in 
this bill. 
The aviation section should be a 
model for any industry that gets 
money from the funds that Mnuchin 
distributes. 
There are two packages. One is a pay-
roll passthrough to keep the people 
working, keep their benefits, and keep 
their pay. The other part is heavily 
conditioned loans: no stock buybacks, 
no dividends, no executive bonuses, and 
no bankruptcy for a year after you 
take these loans. Keep the industry in-
tact. It is vital. 
And $3 billion goes to the contract 
workers and the service workers, who 
are the most abused people in the in-
dustry. They are the ones whom you 
never see who keep the plane clean, 
who load the food, and who move your 
bags and do everything else. They push 
the wheelchairs. They get rotten pay. 
They get assistance in this bill. 
So, this will keep the framework of 
this industry alive. 
COVID–19 is what we are battling 
now, but we have been battling some-
thing else in our economy for a long 
time: corporate greed. Wall Street de-
mands to put profits over people. $2 
trillion in tax cuts went to the people 
at the top. For too long, the working 
people of this country have been ig-
nored. Not this time. 
We need a system that always puts 
workers and families first, not just 
during a national emergency and not 
just when it is politically convenient. I 
am ready at any time to roll up my 
sleeves for that fight. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), who is the Repub-
lican leader of the House Administra-
tion Committee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, as the ranking member of the 
House Administration Committee, I 
want all of my colleagues to make sure 
that before we leave this floor today, 
after, hopefully, passing this piece of 
legislation, that we thank every staff 
member who works for the House, who 
makes sure that this House is clean, 
and who makes sure that this House 
operates. They are here sitting there in 
the well, and they are here in our hall-
ways. They are doing the jobs that 
allow us to do our job. 
On behalf of everyone here, I thank 
them for what they do every single 
day. It is important. 
The first vote that I took on this 
House floor—one of the first—was for 
Superstorm Sandy relief. My good 
friend, Mr. VAN DREW, sitting next to 
me here, I am sure had more of a front-
line view as a State senator in New 
Jersey at the time as to what kind of 
impact that disaster assistance had on 
the ground to those Americans who 
were hurting. 
I went back and took criticism from 
many in the media and some in my 
own party, and I said one thing. I said: 
If there is one job that we as Congress 
should do and do well, it is to help 
Americans recover from a disaster that 
they didn’t ask for. 
We are in the midst of the worst eco-
nomic disaster that we have seen in my 
lifetime. Mr. Speaker, 31⁄2 weeks ago, 
we were in an economy with economic 
growth and historic low sustained un-
employment that we all promised the 
American people we would deliver to-
gether. In less than 31⁄2 weeks, this eco-
nomic disaster has hit many indus-
tries. 
I can say, as I flew out this morning 
from St. Louis to Ronald Reagan Wash-
ington National Airport, there were 
two Members of Congress on the plane 
out of the total of four passengers. If 
you don’t think that industry is on the 
brink of collapse, I urge you to use it 
right now, and you will see. 
But it is our Main Street businesses 
and our Main Street companies that 
line the streets of every rural commu-
nity that I represent and line the 
streets of this great country that are 
hurting the most. It is their economic 
disaster. They are being told that they 
are not able to operate. 
We need to do better. We need to pass 
this bill and give them the revenue, the 
opportunity, and the cash flow to get 
through this so we can get through this 
as Americans. 
Students: You get a chance to defer 
your loan payments. What is great is, 
when these businesses recover, they 
now have the opportunity to tax-free 
help you pay your student debt. 
This is what happens when we work 
together, and these are the things that 
will happen when we pass this bill. It is 
not about social media today. It is 
about helping the American people. 
Let’s do it. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I agree 
with the gentleman from Illinois. This 
is about all of us as Americans, not as 
Republicans and Democrats, helping 
those who are challenged, as all of our 
country is. 
Our next speaker is my dear friend 
from 
New 
York 
City—one 
of 
the 
epicenters of this challenge—who has 
led the Small Business Committee with 
extraordinary ability and passion and 
making sure that the small business-
men and -women of America are helped 
and addressed in this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the majority leader for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces an un-
precedented crisis. With one in three 
Americans being told to stay home to 
flatten the curve, the American econ-
omy has essentially been shut off. Res-
taurants, hotels, bars, retail stores, 
barbershops, dance and yoga studios, 
and gyms—practically every segment 
of the small business sector is suffering 
immeasurably. 
Whether it is Brooklyn, New York, or 
Brooklyn, Wisconsin, small businesses 
are 
the 
heart 
of 
America’s 
Main 
Streets. Unfortunately, many entre-
preneurs are now facing impossible de-
cisions about their future. 
b 0940 
This bill is about assisting these 
Main Street small businesses and their 
workers, not Wall Street banks or big 
corporations. 
We have taken a Republican-written 
bill that was unfairly weighted toward 
big companies and reshaped it to 
prioritize small businesses, their work-
ers, and their families. This emergency 
package channels relief to small enter-
prises now. It provides more than $377 
billion in relief for struggling small 
firms to help them pay workers and 
keep their doors open. 
First, this bill allocates $350 billion 
for forgivable, low-cost loans for busi-
nesses to continue paying their em-
ployees. Let me be clear: These loans 
are fully forgivable if firms keep their 
workforce on the payroll during this 
crisis. Since the crisis began, I have 
been advocating for debt-free ways to 
get capital to small firms. This provi-
sion accomplishes that goal. 
The new Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram is designed to help businesses and 
workers weather the public health cri-
sis, remain open, and, when we finally 
defeat this awful virus, resume growth 
quickly. 
Beyond these fully forgivable loans, 
Democrats 
fought 
for 
emergency 
grants. I am proud to say, working 
with my counterparts in the Senate, 
we have secured $10 billion for SBA to 
provide grants to small businesses for 
the first time in its history. 
Additionally, we must assist current 
SBA borrowers that have loan pay-
ments due soon. That is why we are 
providing every current 7(a) and 504 
loan and Microloan borrower with pay-
ment 
relief 
for 
6 
months. 
This 
deferment will also be open to new bor-
rowers to help them stay afloat. This 
bill provides SBA with $675 million in 
funding to not only hire new staff and 
equipment, but also to ensure SBA 
services are being delivered in lan-
guages other than English. 
Last but not least, entrepreneurial 
development programs will get $265 
million for counseling and training re-
lated to COVID–19. 
I should note, this bill is not perfect. 
It is the result of painstaking com-
promise. As with any compromise, no 
one side got everything they wanted. 
For now, however, small firms need to 
stop the bleeding, and this bill provides 
an economic tourniquet. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work 
we accomplished in this package. I 
thank 
Senators 
CARDIN, 
SHAHEEN, 
COONS, and RUBIO and all the members 
of the House Committee on Small Busi-
ness that worked so hard on this bill, 
as well as the ranking member, STEVE 
CHABOT, and the amazing staff that 
worked long hours to get us here. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for everyone to 
support this bill.

H1823 
March 27, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ROGERS), the leading Repub-
lican on the Committee on Homeland 
Security. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of our efforts 
to defeat this deadly virus. This bill 
will help people who are hurting be-
cause of this outbreak. 
For those from rural districts, like 
mine, our hospitals cannot handle the 
onslaught of patients. Hospitals in my 
district face a situation as dire as it 
has ever been in my 18 years in Con-
gress. The capacity just isn’t there. Be-
fore the COVID–19 outbreak, most hos-
pitals in Alabama’s Third Congres-
sional District were operating with less 
than a one-third profit margin. 
This bill helps those rural hospitals 
by enabling them to buy central sup-
plies, build needed infrastructure for 
broadband and telehealth, and keep 
cash flowing so they can remain able to 
help patients. That is the good news. 
As ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security, I want 
to acknowledge the hardworking per-
sonnel of the Department of Homeland 
Security. These men and women inter-
act with the public daily, whether it is 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion, CBP, ICE, or others. They are 
putting themselves in harm’s way with 
this deadly contagion. I say thank you 
for their dedication to ensuring the 
safety of our Homeland Security. 
This bill provides DHS with a number 
of its requests to combat this deadly 
virus, and I am thankful for that. But 
for some reason, we couldn’t see fit to 
provide the full amount requested by 
Customs and Border Protection and 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
to deal with this virus. There isn’t any 
dedicated money to purchase personnel 
equipment for CBP, for example, or 
ICE. These professionals work face-to- 
face with migrants and they deserve 
better. 
This won’t be the last time Congress 
has to act to mitigate the impact of 
this virus on America. I thank Presi-
dent Trump for his leadership, and the 
willingness of Republicans and Demo-
crats to come together to put Amer-
ica’s needs first. 
There will be the need for more help; 
there will be the need for more legisla-
tion; but, for the time being, this piece 
of legislation must pass, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), my friend and neigh-
bor from across the river, who is the 
chairman of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor and who has done a 
yeoman’s service on working to create 
this legislation and to improve this 
legislation and to make it friendly for 
our workers and for our families. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I say to the majority leader that the 
hard work that we have done is, to a 
large extent, due to the hardworking 
staff who have been up late at night 
doing this work that usually takes 
months. It has just been in days that 
they have been able to put this bill to-
gether. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support the CARES Act. As a result of 
the significant changes made over the 
past few days, this legislation now 
takes important steps to give students, 
workers, and families the support they 
need during this public health emer-
gency. 
Many of the provisions of the bill fall 
within the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. For 
example, one of our most important 
challenges is to help workers maintain 
their income because losing a paycheck 
exposes workers and families to so 
many other problems. 
Yesterday, the new unemployment 
claims soared to over 3 million, and 
that is four times more than the pre-
vious record. The CARES Act responds 
to our challenge by dramatically in-
creasing unemployment insurance by 
an additional $600 a week for up to 4 
months. 
The emergency unemployment insur-
ance program also extends to self-em-
ployed workers, so-called gig employ-
ees, many of whom are not currently 
eligible for unemployment compensa-
tion 
because 
they 
are 
often 
misclassified as independent contrac-
tors rather than employees. 
And to my colleagues who have ex-
pressed concern that these benefits are 
more generous than paychecks earned 
by many low-income workers, I would 
say that the problem is not with the 
bill; the problem is with the Federal 
minimum wage, which has not been in-
creased for more than a decade. 
The CARES Act also maintains ac-
cess to healthcare. The bill specifically 
makes a $200 billion investment in hos-
pitals, health systems, and health re-
search. It also includes a requirement 
that all insurance policies cover the 
full costs of future vaccines within 15 
days of the vaccines being officially ap-
proved. It also helps people maintain 
their insurance, if they are laid off. 
Finally, the bill maintains students’ 
access to education. The CARES Act 
now has more than $30 billion in relief 
for students, educators, schools, and 
institutions of higher learning. 
For institutions of higher learning, it 
will provide financial relief to colleges 
and 
universities 
and 
also 
support 
grants to displaced students. For K–12, 
it will provide help to educators to 
adapt to long-term closures, fund pur-
chases of education technology for on-
line learning, and provide equitable ac-
cess to education for students with dis-
abilities. 
The CARES Act moves us in the 
right direction, but it is important to 
recognize that the legislation is only a 
down payment on the relief that our 
communities will need in the weeks 
and months ahead. We must imme-
diately start work on a fourth package 
that reflects the unprecedented scale of 
this crisis. 
The next package must include safe-
ty protections for frontline healthcare 
workers and emergency responders who 
are risking their lives every day. 
The next package must expand emer-
gency paid sick leave and paid family 
and medical leave without exceptions 
so workers can take care of themselves 
and their loved ones without having to 
sacrifice their paychecks. 
The next package has to ensure that 
Americans who are fighting the disease 
are not hit with costly medical bills 
afterwards. 
In the second response package, we 
established universal, no-cost COVID– 
19 testing. The next package that we 
have should expand the coverage to 
COVID–19 treatment as well. 
Mr. Speaker, it is critical for all of us 
to understand that the CARES Act is 
not a stimulus package; it is a disaster 
relief effort which must continue for as 
long as it takes to ensure that stu-
dents, workers, and families can sur-
vive this crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on all of my col-
leagues to support the legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, my mes-
sage to the American people affected 
by the crisis is simple: Help is on the 
way. 
This is not a perfect bill, and I am 
concerned about the $2 trillion price 
tag. But the American people need 
help, and this response to the present 
crisis will put money into the pockets 
of struggling workers and families. 
This response provides help for small 
business owners who are the lifeblood 
of our economy, and we are responding 
to rising healthcare needs with more 
supplies and financial aid for our strug-
gling hospitals. 
I will cast a ‘‘yes’’ vote for this pack-
age in support of the medical personnel 
on the front lines of this current crisis. 
That includes heroes like the more 
than 200 medical personnel from the 
Fort Campbell Military Base in my dis-
trict who are in New York to provide 
medical support. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill to 
help repair the damage caused by the 
coronavirus to our workers and small 
businesses, but any additional relief 
measures must focus on assisting Main 
Street businesses and working Ameri-
cans. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SCHIFF), the distinguished 
chair of the Intelligence Committee 
and a member of the Committee on Ap-
propriations as well. 
Mr. SCHIFF. ‘‘My fellow citizens, let 
no one doubt that this is a difficult and 
dangerous effort on which we have set 
out. No one can foresee precisely what 
course it will take or what costs or cas-
ualties will be incurred. Many months 
of 
sacrifice 
and 
self-discipline 
lie 
ahead—months in which both our pa-
tience and our will will be tested, 
months in which many threats and de-
nunciations will keep us aware of our 
danger.’’

Mr. Speaker, these were the words of 
John F. Kennedy during the Cuban 
Missile Crisis. They are equally true 
today. We cannot see what course this 
virus will take, not precisely. Many 
months of sacrifice and self-discipline 
will lie ahead for the American people. 
We will be tested, and we will prevail. 
America will rise to meet this chal-
lenge or any other. Our healthcare 
workers already are. In this bill, we 
give them the tools to do the job and 
we give families the financial support 
they need to get by until this time of 
trial and tribulation is over. 
Let us support this bill and help put 
our people and our country on the road 
to recovery. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yielding 
me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.

Economic Security Act. This bill will

Arkansas’ families, hospitals, and busi-
nesses in this unprecedented time. 
I have spent much of the last 2 weeks 
in constant communication with Ar-
kansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and 
his team as well as representatives and 
workers from almost every industry in 
our State. I thank them for their com-
passionate and hard work. I thank 
them for their perseverance. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
honorary 
American 
Winston Churchill said, ‘‘You can al-
ways count on the Americans to do the 
right thing after they have tried every-
thing else,’’ so I am thankful that we 
rejected irrelevant ideas and that both 
sides finally set aside their differences 
and came to agreement that will help 
our families in these trying times. 
May God bless the State of Arkansas, 
and God bless the United States of 
America. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), the chairman of 
the Committee on Veterans Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Majority Leader HOYER. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Senate amendment to H.R. 748, the 
CARES Act. 
571 veterans in the VA’s healthcare 
system 
have 
tested 
positive 
for 
coronavirus. We have already lost nine 
veterans to this virus. Mr. Speaker, 120 
veterans have been admitted to VA 
hospitals; 185 VA employees, including 
doctors and nurses providing lifesaving 
healthcare 
to 
veterans 
with 
coronavirus, have also been infected. 
Because of the lack of widespread 
testing due to supply chain challenges 
like low levels of reagents, shortages of 
swabs and testing kits, a dwindling 
supply of masks to protect healthcare 
workers, understaffed VA hospitals 
without providers to administer the 
tests, and a 2- to 7-day lag time for vet-
erans to receive results, we know that 
the magnitude of this public health 
emergency and the number of veterans 
sickened by this deadly virus are 
underreported. It will only become 
more severe in the weeks to come. 
Providing nearly $20 billion to VA to 
combat this virus is vital. This funding 
will save veterans’ lives, protect VA’s 
healthcare providers and first respond-
ers, and give VA the resources it needs 
to 
serve 
as 
the 
Nation’s 
backup 
healthcare 
system 
in 
communities 
where local hospitals are overwhelmed 
with coronavirus patients. 
Mr. Speaker, this relief package pro-
vides nearly $16 billion in funding for 
VA to provide healthcare to veterans, 
including the purchase of essential 
medical supplies like ventilators. VA 
will have the funds to purchase more 
COVID–19 testing kits, N95 masks, 
gowns, face shields, and gloves—per-
sonal protective equipment to keep 
healthcare providers and staff at the 
VA hospitals safe. 
Healthcare providers and workers 
caring for veterans in their homes at 
VA-run nursing homes, community liv-
ing centers, and State-veteran homes 
will also receive personal protective 
equipment. 
Mr. Speaker, $100 million is allocated 
for emergency management so VA first 
responders have the resources they 
need to help veterans and communities 
during this public health emergency. 
$590 million is set aside for veterans 
most vulnerable to COVID–19: homeless 
veterans and elderly veterans in com-
munity living centers and assisted liv-
ing facilities. 
Over $2 billion is provided to support 
VA’s IT systems and strengthen VA’s 
telework capabilities. Greater telework 
capacity 
reduces 
the 
risk 
of 
coronavirus 
transmission 
in 
VA’s 
workforce and keeps the Department 
running. 
Over $600 million is set aside for VA 
to retrofit its hospitals and clinics to 
increase the number of beds and treat-
ment rooms to care for veterans with 
COVID–19 and deploy mobile treatment 
units. 
Over $2 billion is appropriated for 
veterans who need urgent or emer-
gency care in the community for 
COVID–19. 
Finally, this funding ensures the VA 
healthcare providers putting their lives 
on the line to treat veterans are paid 
for their overtime work hours that 
they work. 
Now, this relief package also makes 
veteran-owned small business owners 
eligible for loans to pay their employ-
ees and keep their businesses afloat 
and prevents veterans from losing their 
homes due to foreclosure. It ensures 
veterans who receive stimulus checks 
remain eligible for pension and means- 
based VA benefits. 
This package is far from perfect, but 
there is so much in this legislation 
that is critical to helping veterans and 
ordinary Americans survive this pan-
demic. I expect that there will be more 
legislation to ensure that no veterans 
or Americans are left behind. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
support this package. 
b 1000 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL). 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, our 
country faces a public health and eco-
nomic challenge unlike any we have 
experienced in 100 years. We must pro-
tect the health of the American people 
while also ensuring our economy is 
able to bounce back as the coronavirus 
subsides. 
I urge at every opportunity that Con-
gress assist Americans with income 
support while also providing a critical 
lifeline to businesses, especially small 
businesses. The CARES Act achieves 
those objectives through direct checks 
to American households, improved un-
employment compensation, and feder-
ally backed loans to businesses. 
This bill is certainly not perfect. 
Rarely do we see perfect in this Cham-
ber, and certainly not in these cir-
cumstances. However, we cannot delay; 
we cannot waiver. We must ensure this 
aid is delivered to the American people 
as soon as possible. 
The American people are looking to 
us to lead at this moment, and we must 
do so now, so I rise to support the 
CARES Act. I urge my colleagues to do 
the same and move this to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman 
for his comments. 
Mayors deal with this problem every 
day on the street face-to-face. They 
know how critical this problem is. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE), 
the 
former 
mayor of Providence and the chairman 
of our policy committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a public health crisis unlike any other 
in modern history. 
Since day one of this pandemic, 
House Democrats have been focused on 
two things: saving lives and supporting 
families, workers, and small busi-
nesses. That is why we moved swiftly 
in recent weeks to pass two bipartisan 
relief packages that provided billions 
of dollars for medicine, protective gear, 
and lab tests; low interest loans for 
small business; emergency paid leave; 
and free coronavirus testing. 
Yet we understood more needed to be 
done 
for 
working 
families. 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL still tried to use this third 
package to put huge corporations first, 
but Democrats fought to make this bill 
about the folks who really need help. 
Thanks to the leadership of Speaker 
PELOSI
and our extraordinary com-
mittee chairs, that is what this bill 
does for healthcare workers on the 
front lines of this fight and the work-
ing folks and small business owners 
struggling to get by. 
That is why this bill provides $130 
billion for hospitals to treat patients 
and to protect workers, $360 billion in 
relief for small businesses, $250 billion

in direct cash payments to workers and 
families, and an average of 4 months of 
full pay for workers who are laid off be-
cause of this crisis. 
Let’s pass this bill now. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, Americans’ 
health and American jobs are being at-
tacked by an invisible virus, and this 
House is called upon to respond today. 
Americans need our help. 
I have heard countless stories of peo-
ple struggling. I spoke to a young 
woman from Kenosha worried about 
losing her job and caring for her young 
children. I listened to a doctor from 
Janesville who desperately needs pro-
tective masks. 
America is fighting a war on two 
fronts: a public health crisis and an 
economic crisis. 
While far from perfect, the CARES 
Act provides needed relief: free testing, 
supplies for hospitals, protection of 
workers’ paychecks, and assistance to 
those who have lost their jobs. 
At times, this bill does leave much to 
be desired. There is unnecessary spend-
ing, including $25 million for a Wash-
ington, D.C., theater. 
However, the Senate did its job. 
President Trump continues to do his 
job. Now the House must do ours. We 
cannot let the perfect be the enemy of 
the good. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE), my friend and the 
president of the freshman class. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, one of 
the many leaders of the talented fresh-
man class. 
Thank you to Majority Leader HOYER 
for his leadership. Thank you to Speak-
er PELOSI for her leadership and our 
very distinguished committee chairs 
for their work on this incredible, im-
portant bill. 
As many have said, this bill is far 
from perfect, but let us be clear about 
one thing: The American people need 
relief now, not tomorrow, not next 
week, not next month—now. 
And so the question before this 
Chamber is very simple: Will we step 
up for the American people? Will we 
step up for the healthcare workers sac-
rificing their own health to save the 
lives of others? For the millions of un-
employed across our country in each of 
our States struggling to make ends 
meet to pay their rent, to be able to 
feed their families? For the small busi-
nesses in Boulder and Fort Collins and 
Broomfield and across our country on 
the brink of collapse? For the sci-
entists at CSU and at NIH and every-
where in between working to develop a 
vaccine to the COVID–19 pandemic? 
I pray and I hope that we will step up 
for them by passing this bill today. 
Let’s get it done. Let’s meet this mo-
ment. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL). 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, last 
Sunday, the Senate announced a bipar-
tisan framework to help individuals 
and small businesses through the Chi-
nese coronavirus crisis, then politics 
entered the fray. In the 5 days that 
have followed, coronavirus has cost 
hundreds of Americans their lives, over 
40,000 infections have occurred, and 
millions of jobs have been lost. 
But, thank goodness, cooler, more 
pragmatic heads have now prevailed. 
I want to thank our President for his 
leadership, for halting travel from 
China, and I want to thank the Presi-
dent for reaching out early to private 
enterprise to solve the testing chal-
lenges. These are the decisions that ac-
tually saved lives. 
And, finally, I want to thank the 
President for his constant message of 
hope and determination, for believing 
in us, that we will develop cures and 
vaccines, that we can and will rebuild 
this great economy. 
As a physician, I want to remind 
Americans to follow the President’s 15- 
day guidelines. Let’s flatten the curve. 
Let’s not let up. Let’s ignore petty po-
litical games and beat this virus. As 
one Nation under God, this exceptional 
Nation will prevail. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, at this 
time, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, as the rep-
resentative of Pennsylvania’s Seventh 
district, just 11⁄2 hours from New York 
City, I have a unique perspective on 
this crisis. 
The two world-class hospital net-
works in my community, the Lehigh 
Valley Health Network and St. Luke’s 
University Health Network, are also 
the biggest employers in my district. 
They anxiously await the spread of this 
disease to our front lines. 
Across my community, our nurses, 
lab techs, PAs, physicians, custodial, 
and cafeteria staff have worked tire-
lessly to care for every patient. Despite 
their concern for their own well-being 
and despite often lacking adequate 
gear to protect themselves, they put 
the most vulnerable ahead of them-
selves. They are the pride of my com-
munity. The actions of healthcare 
workers around the country say to us: 
We are all in this together. 
Our response cannot be: Fend for 
yourself. Now we have to do our part 
and provide them with enough personal 
protective equipment and enough ven-
tilators for their patients. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, the vote we 
take today may be the most monu-
mental vote during our tenure in Con-
gress, and the amount of money we are 
committing is, in itself, epic. 
I have heard folks from both sides, 
and particularly the other side, talk 
about this is all for the families and 
the working people, and yet I find my-
self saying, if that is the case, we 
might have produced a bill that didn’t 
include millions of dollars for non-
essential, nonemergency-related fund-
ing such as the Kennedy Center, NPR, 
the Smithsonian, the Institute of Mu-
seum and Library Services, the Na-
tional Endowment of Arts and Human-
ities. 
Could we have done this without 
strengthening the hands of unions in 
the private sector? Sure. But we give 
$88 million to the Peace Corps, which 
fired over 7,000 volunteers just 10 days 
ago, hundreds of millions more to the 
IRS, refugee assistance, election secu-
rity, and the Department of Education. 
These may be worthy or not, but they 
certainly have no place in an economic 
relief package, and it is a shame that 
they are in here. 
The President is rightly concerned 
about whether the cure here, the eco-
nomic cure, may be worse than the 
sickness. 
We incentivize small employees to 
keep their—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Nevada 
(Mr. HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, Mr. 
Majority Leader, my chairman, Chair-
man NEAL, today this body is here to 
send a united message to the American 
people: Help is on the way. 
Yesterday, the Department of Labor 
released devastating numbers revealing 
that 3.28 million people in America 
filed unemployed claims in the past 
week. My home State of Nevada alone 
saw a 182 percent increase in claims. 
That is unprecedented job loss. Amer-
ican families need unprecedented relief 
to address it. 
An important provision in the Fami-
lies First Coronavirus package laid the 
groundwork for expanding unemploy-
ment benefits. Now, with the CARES 
Act, we are going above and beyond for 
our country’s workers, providing an ad-
ditional $600 per week for the next 4 
months. 
No person in this country should 
worry about putting food on the table 
or paying their bills while trying to 
keep themselves, their families, or 
their neighbors safe. 
I know the pain and uncertainty that 
losing a job or facing a furlough causes. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. CURTIS), the former 
mayor of Provo. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the CARES Act, the largest 
economic disaster recovery package in 
our Nation’s history. Given the size 
and the scope of this pandemic, it is a 
hefty price tag that must be paid. 
But I challenge my colleagues to join 
me in dealing with the consequences of 
spending money we don’t have. It is 
time to get our financial house in order 
before it becomes our next crisis. 
I represent a State that has a bal-
anced budget and a rainy day fund. We 
do it on a State level, and we can do it 
on a Federal level.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1826 
March 27, 2020 
I have heard stories of the dev-
astating effects of COVID–19. One of 
the most important, unique parts of 
Utah’s culture is the pride we take in 
serving one another, especially in a 
time of crisis. This spirit, coupled with 
the targeted stream of resources de-
signed to keep money in the economy 
and people healthy, will be the key in-
gredients 
to 
ensuring 
communities 
across the State can fully heal from 
this unprecedented crisis. We will 
weather this storm together. 
Mr. HOYER. As a former uniformed 
police officer on the streets of one of 
our largest cities in America, our next 
speaker knows firsthand the challenges 
of our first responders. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
O’HALLERAN). 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the CARES 
Act. 
Families and businesses across Amer-
ica and Arizona are struggling, and 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers are being asked to perform their 
important work without proper protec-
tive gear. 
In my district, the Navajo Nation is 
dealing with a disproportionately high 
amount of COVID–19 cases. There were 
71 confirmed cases in the community 
as of last night. This bill allocates over 
$1 billion to the Indian healthcare serv-
ice and to Tribal healthcare providers 
and over $400 million to Tribal govern-
ments for equipment. 
I urge my fellow colleagues to vote 
for this legislative package that will 
provide relief to struggling American 
families and ensure the Tribal commu-
nities are not overlooked. 
There is no excuse for our healthcare 
professionals to not be protected and 
our first responders. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, in times 
like this, I am inspired by the strength 
and generosity of the people in Kansas 
and across our Nation. However, we 
know that the coronavirus outbreak 
has impacted hardworking Kansans, 
their families and their friends and rel-
atives across the country. 
Wichita is their capital of the world. 
In our area, we have already been hit 
hard by the grounding due to the 737 
Max issues, but now small businesses 
are facing uncertainty, as Kansans 
have been asked to stay at home, not 
knowing when they can resume oper-
ations again. 
Today, I rise on behalf of the workers 
and families in Kansas who need Con-
gress to get this right. Every minute 
we spend trying to politicize this crisis 
wastes critical time and hurts Ameri-
cans. We should focus on what really 
matters: offering stability to families 
that need it and getting America back 
open for business again. 
The CARES Act assists small busi-
nesses and distressed industries, giving 
families and unemployed workers the 
financial means to make it to the other 
side of this crisis and ensures that job 
creators are positioned to keep paying 
their workers and rehire those who 
have been laid off when we recover. 
Kansans and Americans across the 
country—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW), who has served his 
country on the front lines of battle in 
the defense of freedom. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, our country 
and the American people are in crisis, 
and it requires our action now. 
To be clear, this is not a perfect bill, 
but it is the bill that America needs 
today. It will provide immediate relief: 
direct cash payments to millions of 
Americans to pay rent, to buy food, 
and to pay their mortgages, and over 
$370 billion to our small businesses in 
immediate grants and loans. 
There is much more that needs to be 
done, but we will work together to do 
it and improve, moving forward. We 
will get through this challenging time 
as a country because that is what 
America does. We are at our best when 
we come together and meet our com-
mon challenges, and that is exactly 
what we will do. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Idaho (Mr. FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, the 
United States of America is at war. Its 
invisible foe is called coronavirus. 
Having a virus is not a new precedent 
for America. It is happened twice in 
the 20th century: the Spanish flu and 
polio. 
But in an attempt to slow this out-
break, we did set a new precedent. For 
the first time in history, we mandated 
the economy shut down by law. 
Now, we don’t yet know the benefits 
of that, but we do know the cost. It is 
about $2 trillion dollars. And one must 
ask: What is the cost of not acting? 
It is agonizing to take on this debt, 
but here is a game-changer for me: 
When the government shut down the 
economy, it assumed the responsibility 
for bringing it back. This virus may 
threaten our health, but 98 percent or 
more will survive that. We will not 
allow the virus to take away our liveli-
hoods. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be supporting the 
bill. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I misspoke 
and elevated Mr. NEGUSE from Colo-
rado, who is on the leadership and the 
freshman representative to the leader-
ship, but now I am really recognizing 
the president of the freshman class, an 
extraordinary woman who has been in 
the Federal Government to rescue our 
automobile industry, and I thank her 
for her service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
before you today in this Chamber dur-
ing this critical time in the United 
States of America, where our country 
faces a battle with a pandemic, the big-
gest battle we have faced as a nation 
together in generations. Amidst uncer-
tainty, we work to keep Americans 
alive by stopping the spread of COVID– 
19. 
In these times, heroes will be made 
and not selected. We are in a global 
pandemic. Many Americans may perish 
unexpectedly and suddenly in unfair 
circumstances. 
These are not pleasant words to hear. 
Treatments and cures are needed. They 
will take time. Economic security 
must be guaranteed. 
The outbreak of COVID–19 has spread 
throughout our land. Listen to the sci-
entists and the doctors who have spent 
a lifetime in this space. Listen to Dr. 
Fauci. This is not a moment to provide 
the false comforts of times past.

are sacrificing so much right now. Our 
students, 
gone 
from 
their 
beloved 
classrooms and classmates. We beam 
for our manufacturers who have no——

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman from Michigan an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Ms. STEVENS. Join me in the calls 
of servitude, sharing in the profession 
with those who have now come before 
you. Similar times of trying medical 
need, wars and flus past, you will see 
darkness, you will be pushed, and our 
society needs you to stand together at 
this time. Our country loves you. 
To our doctors and our nurses, I wear 
these latex gloves to tell every Amer-
ican: Do not be afraid. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Ms. STEVENS. I tell my fellow 
Americans do not be afraid. Look and 
see the beauty and opportunity in na-
ture and humanity all around you.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the legis-
lation. 
This week, Star Parker provided in-
sight in ‘‘Staying Free and Faithful in 
a Pandemic’’ in The Daily Signal: 
‘‘The coronavirus presents challenges 
to us as Nation and as individuals. 
There are principles we should keep in 
mind. We have a Constitution that as-
signs limited, defined powers to the 
Federal Government and leaves the 
rest to the States and individuals.’’

Trump acted with deliberation, shut-
ting down flights from China. We know 
this virus is most lethal to the elderly. 
There are large variations among the 
States. The answer is we should maxi-
mize local responsibility. 
There are two other things to keep in 
mind. One is, life is unpredictable. 
That is why socialism and national 
planning are so bogus and always re-
sult in failure, and that is why freedom 
is 
so 
critically 
important. 
Only 
through freedom is responsibility fo-
cused on individuals. 
Two, faith is critical. It is faith that 
keeps us human, faith that binds us to-
gether, unique individuals. 
‘‘Faith will play a key role in helping 
our Nation through this crisis and 
emerge better for it.’’ 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Queens, New York (Ms. OCASIO-COR-
TEZ), one of the epicenters of this chal-
lenge to our country. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
represent one of the hardest hit com-
munities in the hardest hit city in this 
country, Queens, New York—13 dead in 
a night in Elmhurst Hospital alone. 
Our community’s reality is this coun-
try’s future if we don’t do anything. 
Hospital workers do not have protec-
tive equipment. We don’t have the nec-
essary ventilators. But we have to go 
into this vote eyes wide open. 
What did the Senate majority fight 
for? One of the largest corporate bail-
outs with as few strings as possible in 
American history. Shameful. 
The greed of that fight is wrong for 
crumbs for our families. And the option 
that we have is to either let them suf-
fer with nothing or to allow this greed 
and billions of dollars, which will be le-
veraged into trillions of dollars to con-
tribute to the largest income inequal-
ity gap in our future. 
There should be shame about what 
was fought for in this bill and the 
choices that we have to make. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN). 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, it 
wasn’t so long ago that our country ex-
perienced an event that would bring 
Americans together to fight a common 
enemy and help those in need. 
On September 11, 2001, America expe-
rienced the worst act of terrorism in 
its history. The resolve and patriotism 
I felt that day, as a warfighter, is so 
very similar to the resolve and patriot-
ism I feel today. 
Government can do some things for 
the American people. The CARES Act 
is not perfect, but it provides much- 
needed funds for medical equipment, 
support for small businesses, and addi-
tional tools to fight the crisis. This bill 
is a step forward, and when combined 
with the same American spirit that 
brought us through 9/11 and crises past, 
we can come out of this stronger. 
The true strength of our great Nation 
is what people do for each other. Rug-
ged individualism turns into compas-
sionate sacrifice. The charity of Amer-
ican spirit expands and envelops all 
others. We see those in need. We act. 
We volunteer. We lead. We step into 
the breach. 
Almost nothing perfect comes out of 
government. 
Service, 
however, 
de-
mands that we put forth a perfect ef-
fort to do the best we can. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. BUSTOS), one of the leaders 
of our party from the heartland of our 
country. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the CARES Act. 
Yesterday, the United States became 
the country with the most known 
COVID–19 cases in the world. We are all 
concerned for our families, for our 
friends, for our farmers, for our fu-
tures. 
But today, we have the opportunity 
to take a step forward to come to-
gether, even as we must stand apart, to 
help our fellow Americans, to strength-
en our communities, and to face this 
threat as one. 
Illinois workers are afraid they will 
lose their jobs, if they have not al-
ready. Small businesses are making 
hard decisions between keeping staff or 
closing their doors. And our farmers, 
who have already endured so much 
pain, are worried sick about what is 
ahead this year, not only because of 
this worldwide pandemic, but also be-
cause of the threats of more flooding. 
That is why I join my colleagues on 
the floor today to cast my vote for the 
most significant relief package in 
American history. This vital legisla-
tion will help struggling Americans 
make ends meet. It will expand unem-
ployment insurance to help those who 
lose their jobs through no fault of their 
own. 
It will help small businesses secure 
precious dollars to keep their employ-
ees and communities afloat. It will 
help our farmers, who have always 
stood with us, to provide much-needed 
resources to feed the world. 
This bill is not perfect. No bill ever 
is. But it is the strong medicine we 
need to defeat this invisible enemy. 
Let us come together today to pass 
this bill and declare that no virus will 
ever tear apart this country. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to support this unprecedented eco-
nomic relief package in response to 
these unprecedented times. 
It is clear this pandemic is having a 
profound impact on the American peo-
ple. It is our job to make sure that this 
impact is not a lasting one. 
Especially clear is just how dev-
astating this crisis is hitting rural 
communities like those in central 
Washington. This bill provides des-
perately needed relief to rural hos-
pitals, many of which are the only 
healthcare provider for a great number 
of my constituents. 
It will support the agricultural in-
dustry to ensure hardworking farmers 
and ranchers can continue to provide 
food security for our Nation. It will 
provide stability for workers and small 
business owners who are the backbone 
of our local economies. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a 9/11 moment, a 
time to put partisan differences aside, 
policy goals aside, and work together 
as Americans for the people of our Na-
tion. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CISNEROS). 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Speaker, our 
country is in a crisis, and the Amer-
ican people are looking to Congress for 
action and leadership. That is why I 
stand in support of the CARES Act, 
which provides our workers, small 
businesses, healthcare workers, and so 
many more in California’s 39th District 
the relief they need. 
Whether it is to provide PPE and 
medical equipment to our healthcare 
workers, financial support for our 
workers without jobs, or resources for 
our small businesses, Congress is tak-
ing significant steps to help our com-
munities. 
At the same time, we are enforcing 
strict oversight to prevent secret bail-
outs and ensure that those on the front 
lines of our global epidemic come first. 
While the CARES Act throws a life-
line to our workers and our economy, 
we will need to do more. There is not a 
single community across the United 
States that hasn’t been affected by the 
coronavirus in some way. That is why 
our next stimulus package must pro-
vide direct funding for our cities and 
towns with less than 500,000 residents. 
Although we have had to be phys-
ically apart, our community and our 
country have come together with the 
American 
spirit 
and 
determination 
needed to help us get through this cri-
sis. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Puer-
to Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LES-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, the CARES Act en-
sures that all citizens in Puerto Rico 
are treated equally under the Federal 
grants and benefits incorporated in 
this bill, which I strongly support. 
Puerto Rico has been in lockdown 
since March 15, and more than 48,000 
people lost their jobs already. This bill 
will help our small businesses, people, 
and the nutrition assistance program, 
as well as the health industry, to tack-
le those issues. 
Puerto Ricans are ready because we 
have the infrastructure of a great phar-
maceutical and skilled workforce that 
stands ready to ramp up and deliver 
medications and devices when backed 
up by the Defense Production Act. 
We need to rebuild our American 
workforce in a domestic territory. 
That is the reason I thank the Presi-
dent and the leadership of the Senate 
and the House for putting together this 
economic health package to give our

localities the resources to tackle this 
crisis affecting our Nation so we can 
focus on staying safe and healthy. I 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
it. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the time left for both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 521⁄2 min-
utes. The gentleman from Texas has 63 
minutes. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Mexico (Mr. LUJA´ N), the former chair-
man of our campaign committee and 
an extraordinary candidate for the 
United States Senate for New Mexico. 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the legisla-
tion before us. 
We are living in uncertain times. 
This virus has drastically reshaped 
each one of our communities, and there 
is likely more change to come. 
Today, Americans need us. They need 
the support and resources provided by 
this bipartisan legislation. They need 
access to protective equipment, a per-
sonal safety net, and economic assist-
ance. 
Workers need assurances that their 
economic security is paramount be-
cause it is the American worker at the 
cornerstone of our economy. 
In this bill, I fought so that trade 
workers and engineers employed at 
New Mexico’s national labs can con-
tinue protecting our national security 
mission. We cannot let them down. 
We must pass this bill for the teacher 
who is delivering meals to students to 
make sure they don’t go hungry just 
because they are not in the classroom. 
We must pass this bill for nurses, 
doctors, healthcare professionals, and 
first responders who haven’t slept as 
they provide for the sick. 
We must pass this bill for rural com-
munities that need the lifeline to en-
sure seniors are fed and individuals can 
access healthcare when the nearest 
doctor is hundreds of miles away. 
We must pass this for everyone who 
is fighting to keep one another safe, 
healthy, and afloat. We cannot let 
them down. 
The reality we wake up to each day 
may change, but what remains the 
same is that we face this crisis to-
gether. Like every crisis we have faced 
before, we will get through this to-
gether. 
Passage of this legislation is an im-
portant step, but I want every New 
Mexican and every American to know 
that we understand this uncertain time 
demands an extraordinary response. 
Together, we will not let each other 
down, and we will meet that challenge. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from west Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, the 
Greek physician Hippocrates once said: 
For extreme diseases, extreme methods 
of cure are most suitable. 
While this medicine will have some 
short-term side effects, it is our best 
hope for curing the crisis. 
Our Nation is fighting a global pan-
demic and the prospects of a looming 
national disaster. While I have serious 
concerns with some bad policies, par-
tisan provisions, and the overall price 
tag of this legislation, I am more con-
cerned about inaction, delaying sup-
port for millions of hurting Americans, 
and the threat of an even costlier re-
cession for our country. 
This 
national 
emergency 
has 
wreaked havoc on our country and up-
ended every aspect of our lives. We 
must move quickly to provide tem-
porary relief for our working families, 
small 
businesses, 
and 
frontline 
healthcare professionals. 
Mr. Speaker, this is uncharted terri-
tory. This is an unprecedented crisis. 
Extraordinary circumstances call for 
extraordinary measures. 
I stand united with my colleagues 
and my countrymen in these difficult 
days. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, Amer-
ica is bleeding. America is in deep suf-
fering and even deeper anxiety, and it 
counts on its Congress to respond with 
alacrity, thoughtfulness, and action. 
We have no time to dither. We have 
no time to engage in ideological or 
petty partisan fights. Our country 
needs us as one. 
Mr. Speaker, 3.28 million people filed 
for unemployment last week. In my 
State, that translated into a 17-fold in-
crease in 1 week. The number of 
coronavirus victims quadrupled in that 
time period in my State, and those fig-
ures are reflected throughout the coun-
try. 
Now is the time to come together. 
Now is the time to show our fellow 
countrymen that we can rise to this oc-
casion and re-instill in them the hope 
and confidence that will come. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. WENSTRUP). 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, Amer-
icans are suffering. They are suffering 
in the face of an unseen enemy, a nat-
ural disaster that we can only defeat 
together. 
I have spent hours on the phone with 
Ohioans, national leaders, doctors, re-
searchers, elected officials, and busi-
ness and community leaders, listening 
to what they are doing to help us 
through this crisis and asking what 
they need. 
This bill is not perfect, but it does 
provide emergency relief legislation 
that helps our healthcare workers, our 
hospitals, and our businesses with li-
quidity, and it helps keep our workers 
on the payroll, as well as helping 
Americans most in need. 
We see businesses retooling their in-
dustry. We see groups donating sup-
plies and others seeking cures. We are 
learning many lessons, finding many 
flaws that we must fix so we have the 
opportunity to come back even strong-
er and more responsible than ever. 
We need to pass this bill. This time is 
very unprecedented. Let’s get it done. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), one of the sen-
ior Members of the Congress of the 
United States, a member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to be here as a member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, and 
I rise, as we all know, during one of the 
most challenging moments in the his-
tory of our country and, I would say, 
the world. 
Americans are hurting, and families 
are suffering. The calls that are coming 
to my office, and I am sure to yours, 
too, are just heartbreaking. 
But today, we will pass a bill that 
will provide critical relief to begin the 
healing in our communities. Despite, I 
have to say, the failure of leadership 
from our President, Congress has, in 
fact, stepped up. 
Thanks to the unity of House and 
Senate Democrats, we pushed the ini-
tial Republican proposal from cor-
porate-first to families-and-workers- 
first. 
We fought for and won a $100 billion 
investment in hospitals and healthcare 
systems for our doctors and nurses on 
the front line fighting the coronavirus, 
often without the equipment that they 
need. 
I am imploring the President to fully 
invoke the Defense Production Act so 
that our frontline workers will have 
the protective gear that they need and 
right now are not getting. 
The CARES Act will also provide 
double the unemployment insurance 
benefits that Republicans initially pro-
posed. This will help countless res-
taurant workers and small business 
employees who call my office and say: 
‘‘We need help.’’ 
Thanks to Democrats, the small busi-
ness owners in my district will now be 
able to make payroll, with their mort-
gages and utility costs eligible for 
Small Business Administration loan 
forgiveness. 
Sadly, this bill isn’t all that it could 
be. I am deeply disturbed that my Re-
publican colleagues are trying to ex-
clude local Planned Parenthood clinics 
from this small business financing, es-
pecially since they are helping people 
every single day to be able to get the 
healthcare they need. 
I am also really disappointed that 
they took this opportunity to irrele-
vantly add to this the Hyde amend-
ment. 
I especially want to take the time to 
thank the people who are working 
today, and I am glad to be here among 
you doing just that. But we are seeing 
people who are outside here, the Cap-
itol Police, the people who are helping 
to clean our environment, the people 
who are now working at jobs like the 
people in my grocery store, the Jewel 
Food Store in my neighborhood, the 
people who are bagging my groceries, 
who are loading my shelves, who are

taking my money in order to buy the 
food that all the people in my commu-
nity need. They are risking their lives, 
too, and deserve the thanks. 
I want to thank my Governor, Gov-
ernor J. B. Pritzker, who has actually 
created a response fund that will put 
money into community organizations 
and not-for-profits that can help people 
who aren’t covered here, who need to 
be covered in the next bill. I am talk-
ing about immigrants and undocu-
mented people. 
b 1040 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY), the chair of the 
Republican Conference. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, 67 years 
ago yesterday, Dr. Jonas Salk an-
nounced that the United States had 
successfully tested a vaccine to prevent 
polio, a dreaded virus that afflicted 
tens of thousands of Americans. Mr. 
Speaker, we have beaten terrible dis-
eases before, and we will again. 
When we were attacked on 9/11, our 
heroes were the firefighters and police 
officers who ran towards the burning 
buildings and the citizens who stormed 
the cockpit of flight 93, who put their 
own lives at risk. 
Mr. Speaker, we have those same he-
roes today. Today they are the thou-
sands of nurses and doctors and count-
less other healthcare professionals and 
their staff who work in our hospitals 
and clinics and provide the greatest 
care anywhere in the world. 
Mr. Speaker, we owe them our deep-
est gratitude. We also owe them every 
tool, every piece of equipment, and 
every resource they need to save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, we also have a duty to 
our parents and our grandparents. In 
this greatest Nation on Earth, we pro-
tect the sick and the most vulnerable. 
We owe all we have to our mothers and 
our fathers, to the generations who 
came before, and we must do all we can 
now to protect them. 
All of us, Mr. Speaker, are called into 
the service of this blessed Nation at 
this time of challenge, not as Demo-
crats or Republicans, but as Ameri-
cans. This pathogen does not recognize 
party lines, and no partisan solution 
will defeat it—neither will the govern-
ment acting alone. It will take all of 
the ingenuity and innovation of the 
American private sector working with 
our Federal, State, and local govern-
ments. 
This is not a time for cynicism or in-
vective or second guessing. This is a 
time to remember that we are citizens 
of the greatest Nation on Earth, that 
we have overcome every challenge we 
have faced, and that we will overcome 
this one. 
We are one nation, Mr. Speaker. We 
should all be rooting for our President 
to succeed, for New York Governor 
Cuomo to succeed, for California Gov-
ernor Newsom to succeed, and for Wyo-
ming’s Governor Mark Gordon to suc-
ceed. 
Indeed, we must do everything we 
can to help every State and every Gov-
ernor in our great Union. The bill we 
are voting on today is a crucial step. 
On the Sunday after 9/11, my family 
worshipped at Evergreen Chapel at 
Camp David with the families of Cabi-
net officials and servicemembers who 
were assigned there, many of whom 
would go on to serve overseas in the 
following years. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentlewoman from Wyoming an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, that 
morning, as our Nation faced another 
time of testing, the chaplain urged us: 
Work as though everything depends on 
you, because it does. Pray as though every-
thing depends on God, because it does. 
We will defeat this virus. We will re-
store our economy. We will heal our 
Nation. We are Americans. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 10 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Wyoming for her remarks. 
I am sure all of us on this floor can 
subscribe to them and, hopefully, react 
accordingly. I thank the gentlewoman 
for her remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS), 
another senior Member of the Congress 
of the United States. 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
leader for yielding. 
Whenever our economy is hurting, 
my congressional district in the heart 
of Las Vegas is always among the hard-
est hit. This time is no different. The 
people who work at restaurants in 
Chinatown, clean hotel rooms on the 
strip, and entertain visitors downtown 
are struggling to pay rent and feed 
their children. I want them to know 
that this recovery package was put to-
gether with them in mind. 
The bill will provide direct payments 
to most Americans, expand unemploy-
ment insurance, and give small busi-
nesses increased access to low-interest 
loans. It will add more oversight to 
corporate 
borrowing, 
while 
helping 
make sure that southern Nevadans will 
have a job to return to when this is 
over. 
The bill will also send more resources 
to hospitals to make sure that our he-
roic healthcare workers on the front 
lines of this epidemic have the re-
sources they need. We have all been in-
spired by the example they have set in 
this difficult time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE). 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, last 
night, we learned a Montanan died to 
COVID–19, the first in our State. Our 
hearts are heavy back home. 
Mr. Speaker, Montanans are con-
cerned. They are concerned about the 
health of their families and commu-
nities. They are concerned about the 
fallout from this outbreak. They are 
concerned they may have to shutter 
their businesses and lay off their work-
ers. They are concerned they may not 
have a job tomorrow or see their next 
paycheck. 
We are addressing many of these con-
cerns today in the CARES Act. It helps 
families and workers so they can pay 
their bills and put food on the table, 
provides loans and grants to small 
businesses so they can keep their doors 
open. It boosts funding to support 
those on the front lines, from hospitals 
to healthcare providers to CDC and the 
VA clinics. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote for the CARES Act and 
provide emergency relief to the Amer-
ican people facing this crisis. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA), a retired Navy com-
mander who has been on the front line 
herself and knows what the front line 
is all about. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act. This is a 
necessary step in providing relief to 
families and small businesses through-
out coastal Virginia and across Amer-
ica. This bill provides critical funding 
in helping our communities thrive 
again when this crisis passes. 
As we prepare to provide relief for 
the American people amid this na-
tional emergency, I am reminded of the 
words that President Kennedy would 
have spoken were it not for his un-
timely loss on November 22, 1963. 
‘‘ . . . this a time for courage and a 
time for challenge. Neither conformity 
nor complacency will do. Neither the 
fanatics nor the faint-hearted are need-
ed . . . So let us not be petty when our 
cause is so great. Let us not quarrel 
amongst ourselves when our Nation’s 
future is at stake. Let us stand to-
gether with renewed confidence in our 
cause—united in our heritage of the 
past and our hopes for the future—and 
determined that this land we love shall 
lead all mankind into new frontiers of 
peace and abundance.’’ 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, as a Member who has voted 
against a number of large spending 
bills in the past, I have to admit, this 
legislation has given me significant 
pause. But we as a nation face the larg-
est threats that I have seen in my ca-
reer as a doctor and, certainly, during 
the short time that I have spent in 
Congress. 
The President has declared a na-
tional emergency. Governors are insti-
tuting shelter-in-place orders nation-
wide, and consumers have been told not 
to consume because businesses have 
been told to shut their doors and not 
conduct business. 
If government is forcing them to 
shutter their doors, then our responsi-
bility is to help them out. The Amer-
ican Dream cannot be shut down by a

March 27, 2020 
virus, and that is why I will support 
this legislation, Mr. Speaker. It is time 
to put political gamesmanship aside 
and pass legislation for the health and 
safety of our Nation. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from the 
Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, our 
Nation faces the worst pandemic in 
most of our lifetimes. We are, indeed, 
in an unprecedented time. Like the 
rest of the Nation and countries around 
the world, the Virgin Islands’ life has 
significantly been altered. 
Americans need the urgent action of 
this body, the Congress, to address this 
threat to the lives and livelihood of the 
American people. We do so with pas-
sage of this bill. 
It is not a perfect bill, but this short- 
term action will go a long way to save 
lives, help the economy, and pave a 
path to recovery. 
Aside from support to healthcare and 
the economy, one of the most impor-
tant measures in this bill, in the 
CARES Act, is the support and invest-
ment we make in our children. The $30 
billion in educational funds, as well as 
the $14 billion allocated to higher edu-
cation, will do that. 
The foresight and fortitude of the 
Speaker and Democratic leadership to 
ensure that small businesses, local gov-
ernment, and American workers and 
families—often forgotten—are included 
in this bill will go a long way. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, this is 
not a crisis caused by a specific indus-
try or weak economy. This is a vol-
untary shutdown of our economy in 
order to save lives. As a result, our 
government needs to support the fami-
lies and businesses that are directly 
feeling the pain of this national emer-
gency. 
The CARES Act will buy the needed 
resources 
for 
our 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare providers to safely care for 
the sick, ensure that hardworking 
Americans receive income and in-
creased unemployment benefits during 
the crisis, extend emergency loans to 
small businesses which are forgivable 
for retaining their employees during 
this crisis, and establish a stabilization 
fund for other stressed businesses and 
to maintain liquidity in our economy. 
This bill is not perfect, but it is a 
necessary response to an unprece-
dented crisis. With these policies, cou-
pled with the efforts of the private sec-
tor and the American people, we will 
defeat the virus and be ready for what 
will truly be a great American come-
back. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS), the chair of the 
Financial Services Committee, a senior 
Member in the Congress of the United 
States. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 748, now referred to as the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act, or CARES Act. 
Congress must take action to provide 
relief and assistance to the millions of 
people across the Nation who are strug-
gling in the midst of this national pub-
lic health and economic emergency. 
With 3.3 million Americans filing for 
unemployment last week, 1 million 
Californians filing for unemployment 
in the last 2 weeks, and many families 
struggling to make ends meet, it is our 
duty as elected officials to step up and 
help them. 
Several weeks ago, as the chair of the 
Financial Services Committee, I led 
the Democratic members on the Finan-
cial Services Committee in devising a 
comprehensive plan to address the fi-
nancial 
services 
aspects 
of 
the 
coronavirus crisis. I am pleased that 
today’s bill includes some elements of 
this plan. 
The legislation before us takes im-
portant steps to protect and provide re-
lief for consumers, renters, home-
owners, and people experiencing home-
lessness. 
The bill will address the shortage of 
key medical supplies and equipment by 
providing a $1 billion appropriation to 
the Defense Production Act Fund. 
It will support small businesses and 
local, territory, and State governments 
and ensure that any Federal aid to cor-
porations has conditions and inde-
pendent oversight. 
The bill provides $4 billion to help 
combat the outbreak of this disease 
among the homeless community. 
Most importantly, building upon my 
proposal, most individuals and families 
across the country will receive a check 
or direct deposit for $1,200 for each 
adult and $500 for each child to help 
our families who are struggling during 
this unprecedented crisis. 
While I am pleased that the legisla-
tion includes these provisions that 
Democrats fought for, while I support 
the bill’s passage, I must make it clear 
that the legislation is far from com-
prehensive and that there are issues 
that it leaves unaddressed and areas 
where it falls short. 
H.R. 748 does not prohibit negative 
credit reporting during the crisis, for-
give student loan debt, or suspend all 
consumer 
credit 
payments, 
among 
other concerns. However, despite these 
shortcomings, this bill is the most con-
sequential piece of legislation that 
many of us will ever vote on. 
The American people need help, and 
they need it now. This bill represents a 
down payment on that relief. I look 
forward to working with the Speaker, 
my committee colleagues, the Senate, 
and others on the next phase of relief. 
While it is clear that Congress must 
pass a fourth package to address these 
and other shortcomings, the passage of 
today’s bill is critical for all families 
and communities. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK), the top 
Republican on the Budget Committee. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, we have 
a responsibility to the people we serve, 
and the moment is now to mitigate the 
damage to our people and our economy. 
For those who question the price tag, 
for those who question certain features 
in the bill, think of the images we have 
all seen that are unprecedented in our 
lifetimes: the senior citizen only able 
to see family members through a win-
dow; worse yet, Americans dying alone; 
the 
frontline 
medical 
professionals 
fighting an invisible disease, risking 
their very lives to bring hope to a 
frightened 
public; 
the 
businessman 
fighting to stay solvent, to keep a 
workforce, and to live to see another 
day; the scientists and engineers des-
perately searching for an answer. 
Who among us can question the crisis 
we are in and the needs of the people 
we serve? 
By midday today, Mr. Speaker, let us 
be remembered for taking the actions 
necessary to put aside our politics and 
deliver to the American people. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER), who also has 
seen challenge up front and personal. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
will be voting for this bill for the chil-
dren who are forgoing their school and 
for the millions of children for whom 
that means that they are losing the 
stability and the nutritional support 
that comes with it. 
I will be voting for this bill for my 
family members and my friends and 
constituents who have lost their jobs 
in the past 2 weeks because of this pan-
demic. 
I will be voting for this bill so that 
we may deliver support to the small 
business 
owners 
and 
restaurateurs 
throughout central Virginia who have 
closed their doors in order to stop this 
pandemic and keep their neighbors 
safe. 
I will be voting for this bill for the 
healthcare workers in my district who 
are risking their lives to make our 
communities safer. 
I am grateful to the sanitation work-
ers, the mail carriers, the UPS work-
ers, the FedEx workers, the grocery 
store workers, and those who work in 
our nursing homes and facilities across 
our districts and across our country. I 
thank them for adding a bit of stability 
to our country during this extremely 
difficult time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 531⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Mary-
land has 39 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. FLORES). 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, a few 
days ago, White House and congres-
sional Republicans presented a bold, bi-
partisan plan of action to help hard-
working Americans deal with our cur-
rent challenges. This plan puts much- 
needed resources where they are most

needed: our families, our healthcare 
system, our small businesses, our other 
businesses affected by this crisis, and 
our State and local governments. 
One of the things that we found out 
during this crisis is that our healthcare 
system supply chain relies far too 
much on foreign sources like Com-
munist China. We can never allow this 
to happen again. 
In order to fix that problem, I am 
pleased the Senate and House nego-
tiators included my request to help 
fund $3.5 billion to utilize three exist-
ing centers in innovation for advanced 
development manufacturing. 
One of these CIADMs is part of the 
Texas A&M University System, which I 
represent. These public-private CIADM 
partnerships are uniquely positioned to 
accelerate research, development, and 
manufacture of vaccines and thera-
peutics to mitigate pandemics, and 
they do it right here in America. 
b 1100 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY), my good friend. 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
coronavirus emanating from China is 
here. We can’t stop that. We can’t go 
back, but I am distressed by the Hob-
son’s choice that we have. 
It is ravaging our communities. It is 
ravaging our healthcare system. It is 
ravaging our economy. And we should 
be solely focused on healing our com-
munities and saving the small busi-
nesses, the big businesses, and the 
economy that make America great. 
So as we discuss this and also discuss 
a fourth—yet another—package, no 
more Hobson’s choice, no more billion- 
dollar bailouts for things that are un-
related, no more policies that are long- 
standing for a short-standing issue 
that needs our critical attention. 
Mr. Speaker, whatever we do, let’s do 
no harm. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BURGESS), my fellow Texan. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for the recognition. 
Our country is in a war crisis unlike 
anything that has been seen for over 
100 years, but there are heroes. We 
know our first responders. We know 
our doctors and nurses on the front 
lines, in our intensive care units. We 
know what heroes they are. But, Mr. 
Speaker, not all heroes wear capes. 
I have a furniture manufacturer in 
my district, Barbara Caldwell, who 
called me last weekend and said she 
wanted to transition her furniture 
manufacturing to manufacture per-
sonal protective equipment, and she is 
doing so. 
I had an aircraft manufacturer that 
said they wanted to manufacture ven-
tilators, and they are changing their 
clean room and hiring the engineers so 
that they can do that. 
We do have heroes in this country. 
They don’t always wear capes. 
I also want to recognize the hard 
work done by the staff on the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce Sub-
committee—J.P. Paluskiewicz, Kristen 
Shatynski, Kristin Seum, Caleb Graff; 
and then on my staff, Elizabeth Allen, 
Casey Patchunka, Rachel Huggins, and 
my chief of staff, James Decker—who 
are all over in the office right now 
making certain that this goes smooth-
ly. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HARRIS). 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, we are 
here a week too late, not because we 
didn’t know what our citizens and busi-
nesses needed, but because too many in 
the congressional swamp felt that you 
never let a serious crisis go to waste: 
filling this important bill with pork 
and earmarks, like $25 million to the 
Kennedy Center, $57 million to NPR, 
$75 million to the National Endowment 
for the Humanities instead of more 
masks and ventilators. 
But, Mr. Speaker, many Americans 
do need our thanks: 
Thank 
you 
to 
the 
frontline 
healthcare workers who selflessly and 
compassionately care for victims of the 
Wuhan virus. 
Thank you to President Trump for 
his leadership and for his transparency 
with the American people in this time 
of crisis. 
Thank you to my anesthesiologist 
colleagues who have stepped up to the 
challenge. They are trained in inten-
sive care, and the ventilators on their 
anesthesia machines could prove crit-
ical if this fight escalates. 
Finally, thank you to all those 
Americans who followed the Presi-
dent’s recommendation on 15 Days to 
Slow the Spread of the Wuhan virus. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE). 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, as all of 
our colleagues came in yesterday and 
this morning and make an effort to get 
back, it was important that we were all 
home last week. 
I was home last week and got to talk 
to a barber, sole proprietor, has his 
own shop and had to close down be-
cause of the order. Now he is going to 
have an income. 
I talked to a businessman, who said, 
almost in tears: I am going to have to 
lay people off for the first time in 40 
years of business. After this bill passes, 
he will not have to do that. 
And the businesswoman who says: I 
have a rent payment due at the end of 
the month; after this bill passes, she 
will be able to pay her rent. 
Mr. Speaker, I am humbled, and 
today, I am going to vote for the larg-
est bill in American history. I think it 
should make us all a little nervous, but 
it is, after being home, listening to the 
stories of those in our communities, 
the right thing to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support our communities 
and support those making our country 
better, and I am here to say I am going 
to support this bill, and I encourage 
my colleagues to do so as well. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is indeed his-
toric, the largest disaster relief pack-
age in American history. I am dis-
appointed, as many of my constituents 
are, that much of this bill is not di-
rectly targeted at emergency relief, 
but that is the cost of doing business in 
a divided government in such divided 
times. 
Indeed, much that was on the last- 
minute ideological wish list has been 
removed and focus returned to the 
virus and its economic effect. A col-
league said earlier, this is much like a 
9/11 moment. It is up to us today. 
Highlights include: help for our re-
vered veterans, nearly $20 billion for 
their medical care, homeless vets, and 
modernizing VA telehealth; expansion 
of telehealth into rural America, like 
my own district, to bridge that gap in 
rural services technology; $350 billion 
in guaranteed SBA loans, cushioning 
the blow and providing much stability 
for small businesses so that their em-
ployees will have jobs waiting when the 
all clear signal finally sounds. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my hope and pray-
er that this act hits the targets and 
brings the certainty that I hope most 
of us in this room desire and, impor-
tantly, meets the needs of the very 
concerned American people. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
President 
Trump and his team for leading our 
country back to stability. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. SUOZZI), former county exec-
utive in Long Island. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, as you 
know, my father was born in Italy, and 
he would say, ‘‘What a country.’’ And 
my grandfather, at family weddings, 
would give advice to the new couples 
and say: ‘‘Non c’e sono rose senza 
spine,’’ ‘‘You cannot have a rose with-
out the thorns.’’ 
Well, we mourn the thorns in our 
country right now. So many people are 
suffering because of their health, be-
cause of their sickness, because they 
are worried about their family’s fi-
nances, and because of the deaths that 
have taken place. 
But, today, we have to also celebrate 
the roses, those essential workers who 
are working for the common good 
every single day: the grocery workers, 
the postal workers, the healthcare 
workers, the people who are out on the 
front lines every single day, looking 
out for us every single day. 
I want to celebrate, today, the roses 
of life: of Democrats and Republicans 
coming together for the common good, 
putting aside ideological purity and 
working together to try and help peo-
ple who are facing these desperate 
times. 
Mr. Speaker, God bless this country, 
and God bless all of our American peo-
ple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1832 
March 27, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. PENCE). 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
I got in my car and drove to Wash-
ington, D.C., from Columbus, Indiana, 
on behalf of the voters in Indiana’s 
Sixth District. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here to support 
President Trump and be a voice for 
Hoosiers who need relief from this 
virus now. I have been fully engaged in 
making sure that this package pre-
serves the health and livelihood of 
Americans. 
We need to protect the health of 
Americans and get them back to work. 
Congress has come together to provide 
relief and support for hospitals, fami-
lies, workers, and small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I came here to fight for 
Hoosiers’ prosperity and the American 
Dream. We can’t afford to wait another 
minute for relief. Let’s do our job and 
get it done. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SWALWELL). 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. 
Speaker, we will get through this. That 
is who we are. That is what we do. 
Throughout our country’s history, 
with leadership and resources, the 
American people have shown resilience 
to overcome every crisis we faced. This 
will be no different. 
As we meet here in this Chamber, 
across America, from Eden Hospital in 
Castro Valley, California, to hospitals 
in New York City, our health workers, 
our doctors, our nurses, our reception-
ists—the janitors who support them— 
are toiling away to heal the sick. We 
see them. We hear them. We need 
them. And this bill, more than for any-
one else, is for them. 
This relief package also helps the 
next generation: student borrowers, 
people who are working their first jobs 
and paying off their student loan debt 
and, without a paycheck, find them-
selves in financial quicksand. This al-
lows them to cancel their payments 
through the end of the fall and also 
suspends the accrual of interest. 
Mr. Speaker, we will get through 
this. It is just who we are, and it is 
what we do. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
strong 
support 
of 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act and our President. 
This pandemic has upended life for 
everyone. I have heard from workers 
living from paycheck to paycheck who 
face an uncertain future. I have heard 
from struggling farmers. I have heard 
from small business owners who sud-
denly can’t make payroll or rent. I 
have heard from courageous healthcare 
professionals and first responders who 
desperately need personal protective 
equipment to continue to care for the 
sick. 
These are incredibly trying times. 
While the CARES Act won’t solve 
every unique challenge, help is on the 
way. 
America has faced periods of pro-
found adversity in the past. Each time, 
we prevailed. Together, as Americans, 
we will do so again. 
But may we remember that, while 
our Nation is locked down, our creator, 
God, is wide open to our prayers. Let’s 
use them as we put hands and feet, to-
gether, to our prayers. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND), one of the first 
two Native American women to serve 
in the Congress of the United States. 
And this bill, of course, reaches out to 
our Tribal communities to make sure 
that they are whole. 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, this 
global crisis causes us to ask: How do 
we value the workers who grow and 
harvest our food? How do we value the 
healthcare workers who risk their own 
lives for our loved ones? How do we 
value the people who educate and care 
for our children? 
Democrats fought hard to ensure this 
bill includes comprehensive support for 
healthcare workers. It also creates a 
$150 billion relief fund so that State, 
local, and Tribal governments can fight 
this pandemic. 
I know what it is like to live pay-
check to paycheck. The stimulus pack-
age provides direct payments to work-
ing familles so they can pay bills. The 
Small Business Rescue Plan will aid 
small businesses and nonprofits in New 
Mexico to maintain their existing 
workforce and pay rent. 
Yet, still, Congress must continue to 
act. Even after we stop the spread of 
this virus, we must ensure our families 
have the help they need. I support the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act because we must battle 
this threat together. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, COVID–19 is hitting our country 
hard and fast, but Americans across 
our country and in my home district in 
northeast Ohio are rallying together to 
confront and overcome this latest chal-
lenge. 
In Ohio’s 16th District, we have seen 
restauranteurs with now-empty dining 
rooms making free meals for students 
in Green Local School District. We 
have seen businesses, like Buehler’s 
Grocers, do everything they can to pre-
vent layoffs and support employees 
who come to work every day to ensure 
their shelves are stocked for those who 
need it. 
Our hospitals are bracing for impact, 
but we have seen our healthcare pro-
viders, like at the Cleveland Clinic and 
University Hospitals, working their 
hardest to innovate through this crisis 
by developing their own tests and 
launching drive-through testing facili-
ties. 
Our great Governor, Mike DeWine, is 
setting the gold standard of leadership 
in response to this crisis. He is taking 
decisive action to flatten the curve and 
save lives in the Buckeye State. 
This bill provides critical resources 
for those who need it most: our heroic 
healthcare workers, our small busi-
nesses, the unemployed, and our local 
leaders who are fighting this virus on 
the front lines. 
Mr. Speaker, I vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Staten 
Island, New York (Mr. ROSE), who, him-
self, has been on the front lines fight-
ing for freedom and, now, fighting for 
our people. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of this bill be-
cause each and every day new workers, 
people in my own community, are 
dying. 
I rise today in support of this bill be-
cause our front line soldiers of this 
war—our nurses and our doctors—need 
masks. 
I rise today because days from now, 
weeks from now, New Yorkers will 
need thousands of more ventilators. 
I rise today because hundreds of 
thousands of New Yorkers have been 
laid off. 
And I rise today in support of this 
bill because this virus doesn’t see party 
affiliation. Today, we rise as Ameri-
cans, not Democrats or Republicans. 
Mr. Speaker, lastly, I rise today in 
support of this bill because this is just 
the beginning. More work will need to 
be done. New York needs more help, 
but we are Americans, and we can get 
the job done. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DUNN). 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the CARES Act. 
COVID–19, otherwise known as the 
coronavirus, has seriously impacted 
our country, both medically and eco-
nomically. During this unprecedented 
time, it is imperative that we not only 
take proper precautions, but react in 
an effective manner. 
This bill is not perfect. It has a very 
large price tag. However, a crisis of 
this magnitude requires Congress to 
act swiftly and decisively. This bill 
represents a bipartisan compromise 
that can make this happen. 
We have single household incomes, 
seniors on fixed incomes, and small 
business owners who need relief right 
now. My constituency is still rebuild-
ing after Hurricane Michael, and I in-
tend to do whatever it takes to get 
them the help they need right away. 
This is an excellent opportunity for 
us all to come together and support our 
constituents. Please join me in sup-
porting this stimulus package. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to stand here today and to

in Dover, and in Clark who are out of 
work, to our restaurant owners in Som-
erville and Summit, to our nurses and 
doctors at Overlook and Hunterdon 
Medical: Help is on the way. 
This does not mean we are done. 
There is so much more to do for our 
local governments, for example, for our 
hospitals and healthcare system. Con-
gress must keep working. 
Let’s use technology. Let’s use re-
mote voting. Let’s have virtual hear-
ings to make sure this money we are 
approving goes out the door quickly 
and to the right people. 
And let’s remember, we are not here 
today rescuing the economy because of 
a virus. We are rescuing the economy 
because of our failure as a nation to 
test for that virus. 
So Congress will do our job. We will 
take care of the economy. I implore the 
President to work with us, Republicans 
and Democrats, to fix the supply chain 
for masks, for ventilators, for test kits. 
Don’t talk about reopening America 
until we have done what we must to re-
open it safely. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. SCHWEIKERT). 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
think of this: Doesn’t it feel like it was 
just yesterday the Federal Reserve 
Chairman was telling us we were in the 
Goldilocks economy? The wage growth 
for the working poor was the best in 
modern economic times. 
I will argue we need to find a path 
back to that. That economic growth 
was moral. It was an amazing thing. 
Good things were happening. And then 
we hit this black swan. 
This is ripping my heart out because 
there are things in this bill that just 
don’t belong there. I consider them— 
well, I can’t say that word in front of a 
microphone. We all have these mo-
ments in our political lives where we 
walk up in front of this microphone 
and we are going to say: I am going to 
have to vote for something that has 
things in it that break my heart. 
But we must do the right thing. We 
must 
get 
back 
to 
that 
economic 
growth. We must get back to that pros-
perity that was enveloping this coun-
try. And, hopefully, we will look back, 
do a great postmortem, understand the 
things we did wrong, and fix them in 
the future. 
b 1120 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. LYNCH). 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this bill, and I want to asso-
ciate myself with the remarks of the 
gentlewoman from Wyoming. 
Although, in recounting the heroes of 
9/11, she forgot the United States Post-
al Service workers, and we have forgot-
ten them in this bill. 
During 9/11, the United States Postal 
Service workers continued to deliver 
the mail despite the anthrax attacks. 
And they continue to deliver medical 
supplies and medicines to every home 
and business in America today, 6 days 
a week, yet they received no benefits in 
this bill. 
We need them also to execute a deliv-
ery-by-mail system, a vote-by-mail 
system, in this crisis to preserve our 
democracy as this crisis continues. So 
we need to fix that in the next bill that 
we consider for this type of relief. We 
have to remember the United States 
Postal Service workers and the great 
job they have done on behalf of our 
country. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BUCSHON). 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, these 
unprecedented times call for unity to 
help Hoosiers and all Americans who 
are struggling medically and/or finan-
cially through no fault of their own. 
This relief package puts Americans 
first, with aid for families, workers, 
small businesses, and companies that 
employ millions of people. 
There is assistance for healthcare 
providers who are on the front lines, 
working tirelessly to save our friends, 
neighbors, and family members from 
COVID–19, in addition to their usual 
duties. 
I am proud to see that two provisions 
I have helped author are included in 
this package. These bipartisan policies 
will ensure patients have timely and 
affordable access to COVID–19 preven-
tive care, such as vaccines and testing, 
and make clear that doctors who pro-
vide volunteer medical services during 
this public health emergency have li-
ability protections. 
I have spent the past week talking to 
hospitals in Indiana. It could not be 
clearer that they need our help, just as 
we need their help, to defeat the virus 
and to keep our loved ones safe. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
package so we can provide the relief 
Americans desperately need. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in favor of this bill, but also to 
say thank you to my brothers and sis-
ters who are on the front line, yes, 
those who work in the supermarkets, 
who are delivering the mail, who keep 
the lights on, who keep the water run-
ning. We are thanking them because 
they are making a sacrifice today. 
We have always been tough. Ameri-
cans are special, and we will rise to 
this occasion. Fate calls us. We will an-
swer. 
We say thank you to everyone here 
and to all those serving America. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. UPTON), the former chairman 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, let’s face 
it: Coronavirus has totally disrupted 
our lives across the country, in every 
community and certainly around the 
globe. To all of us, it is frightening. It 
is a nightmare. 
This bill is a partial response to end 
that disruption. It provides our med-
ical workers, our hospitals, our small 
businesses, and virtually every family 
needed assistance. 
To you who oppose this bill, please, 
please stand down. We can’t wait an-
other day to help. Don’t add to this dis-
ruption by, in fact, being a disrupter. 
Be a leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE), one of our most 
senior Members. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
join my friend from Michigan. There 
should be no one who rises to object, in 
spite of the fact that we know there 
are challenges in this bill. 
But I hear these words: ‘‘We are 
scared. We are stressed,’’ the words of 
an emergency room doctor. These are 
the ones who are on the front lines 
right now, today, when we have the 
largest number of cases as a nation and 
over 1,100 dead. 
Now we have $500 billion for indus-
tries, with oversight; $350 billion for 
small businesses, which includes the 
microbusinesses, the gig economy, and 
faith institutions and nonprofits. I will 
fight to make sure all of our nonprofits 
get it. We also have direct payments 
for individuals, as well as $100 billion 
for hospitals. 
I watched as the Memorial Medical 
Center gave out over 1,100 tests, a 
small hospital putting themselves on 
the front line. 
Here are my words, Mr. Speaker: No 
man is an island. Each man’s death di-
minishes me, for I am involved in man-
kind. 
We must get this passed for the peo-
ple of the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, and founder and Co-Chair of 
the Congressional Corona virus Task force, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 748, the 
‘‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity Act’’ or ‘‘CARES Act,’’ which is the third 
and latest bipartisan assistance and relief 
package passed by Congress and provides 
more than $2 trillion to address the adverse 
health and economic impacts of the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
I quote Dr. Megan Ranney, an Emergency 
Room Physician: ‘‘We are scared. We are 
stressed. And we’re worried about what 
comes next and about our ability to take care 
of our patients and our communities. As well 
as our ability to take care of ourselves.’’ 
Therefore, I rise to thank all of the First Re-
sponders all over the nation—medical per-
sonnel are First Responders. 
I specifically, thank my Hometown Houston 
local leadership—mayors, the County Judge, 
School leaders and all volunteers—thank you. 
COVID–19 is the great equalizer—we all 
can become ill from it—no matter if we are 
rich or poor; the powerful or the powerless. 
We will all succeed, or we will all fail—today 
we are here to make sure that all of America 
succeeds. 
Tens of thousands of medical personnel and 
professionals are on the frontlines of a battle 
over the survival of tens of millions of people 
in the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1834 
March 27, 2020 
We as a nation must place our trust and 
faith in these heroes as they take to the battle-
field of emergency rooms, ICUs and beyond to 
win this war against COVID–19 because they 
are the only warriors capable of waging a suc-
cessful battle against this implacable foe. 
The title of the Greatest Generation that 
ever was—is held by the generation that 
fought World War II. 
They did not bestow that title upon them-
selves—it was future generations who looked 
back on what they had done and how their 
sacrifices saved future generations from war, 
famine, and untold horrors from authoritarian 
regimes. 
Future generations will judge what we do in 
our moment of crisis to save them from the ef-
fects of this pandemic and the consequences 
of future pandemics that may threaten to 
emerge in the future. 
Let us be judged as worthy to be on the list 
of Great Generations to have guided this na-
tion during some of its darkest hours into the 
light of day—still shining as that beacon of 
freedom for the world. 
The needs of families are three-fold: health 
maintenance, healthcare, and financial. 
This is just the third measure to address the 
needs of the American people, but more will 
need to be done as this national—no global 
disaster unfolds. 
I and my fellow Democrats will man the 
ramparts of this nation and keep a close eye 
on the frontlines of this battle to ensure that 
the people in the fight have everything they 
need to win this war. 
The economic and emotional stress that 
families and working people are under in this 
nation during this crisis is tremendous and 
they need the help that we Democrats have 
fought and won for them in each of the bills 
passed so far and in this measure. 
I join my fellow Democrats in supporting 
passage of each of the bills that provide es-
sential tools to local, state, tribal, territorial 
governments and to individuals and families to 
help them weather this storm. 
I fought for cash payments for all Americans 
up to $3000 per adult and $1500 per child and 
the bill provides for $1,500 per adult and 
$7,500 for a family of five. 
I sought relief for the entertainment industry 
including freelancers, independent contractors 
and those in the music, dance, and visual per-
forming arts—the bill provides for enhanced 
unemployment compensation of $600 a week 
for any worker affected by COVID–19 to be 
combined with other benefits to replay 100 
percent of wages for the average worker. 
I fought for the development of a small busi-
ness grant program funded through the Com-
munity Development Block Grant (CDBG) pro-
gram by way of H.R. 6292, ‘‘The COVID–19 
Recovery Small Business Grants Act.’’ This 
legislation is modeled after my Hurricane Har-
vey Relief legislation and it should include en-
hanced support for restaurants and bars. Add 
$125 million dollars more to the CDBG ac-
count—the bill provides $500 billion in grants 
and interest free loans. I requested much 
needed relief for non-profit organizations in-
cluding faith-based institutions who are closed 
due to the Coronavirus and the allows these 
entities to access the $350 billion in funding 
provided to small businesses. 
I fought for and will continue to fight for 
small businesses who purchased business 
interruption insurance coverage are being told 
by insurance companies that they will not 
cover the Coronavirus. 
I wrote to the President requesting that he 
invoke the Defense Production Act to fully im-
plemented his authority to meet the need for 
personal protective equipment, medical sup-
plies and technology to save lives. 
I sought support for the aviation industry in 
the form of low interest loans, and I will con-
tinue to work to include them in the next aid 
package with the condition that they must 
agree to no employee layoffs and no share 
buybacks. 
I fought for $155 billion for hospital expan-
sions to create more bed space that will be 
needed for Coronavirus victims and the bill 
provides for $150 billion for hospitals and $80 
billion in low interest loans to hospitals. 
I also, sought a directive to be issued prior 
to mass testing for the reimbursement to 
health providers who are providing free test-
ing, the cost of test should be fully borne by 
the Federal government and not healthcare 
providers—the bill eliminates cost-sharing for 
COVID–19 treatments and vaccines for all pa-
tients. 
In addition to these measures, I am working 
to include in the next aid package: a prohibi-
tion on foreclosures or evictions for upwards 
of 3 to 6 months for all housed persons living 
within the United States; utility restoration so 
that every American has access to potable 
water, electricity, and where available natural 
gas while complying with stay at home orders, 
quarantines, and telework requirements; and 
funding for alternative facilities and relocation 
needs for prisoners to prevent community 
spread within federal, state, and local prison 
systems. 
The government is an umbrella on a stormy 
day. 
The storm instead is not just hitting one 
community, region or state it has it is hitting 
the entire country with every community, 
neighborhood, and family with tremendous 
force that they need help that only the Federal 
government can provide. 
In 2008, it was said that some companies 
were too big to fail, well today the American 
family is too important to the future of this na-
tion to fail and we Democrats will make sure 
that they have all that is required to save as 
many lives as possible and assure not only 
physical survival but your economic survival. 
Some may wonder why the American family 
matters so much to our nation. 
According to the Center on Budget and Pol-
icy Priorities, half of federal revenue or 51 per-
cent comes from individual income taxes. 
Another 35 percent of revenue comes from 
payroll taxes, which are assessed on the 
wage or salary paychecks of almost all work-
ers and are used to fund Social Security, 
Medicare Hospital Insurance, and unemploy-
ment insurance. 
Corporate income taxes make up about 6 
percent of federal revenue, with the remaining 
8 percent coming from excise taxes, estate 
taxes, and other revenue sources. 
It is imperative that we are clear eyed about 
what we are doing with the tax revenue of this 
nation—it is paid by working people. 
Corporations, businesses and top one per-
cent of the nation’s wealthiest people received 
a trillion-dollar tax cut last year. 
Nothing in the COVID–19 emergency re-
sponse measures has changed this fact. 
Given the state of the demand on the fed-
eral treasury the funds provided to major cor-
porations and businesses that so richly bene-
fited from the tax cuts should repay any funds 
paid to them from the treasure. 
This is only fair, right and just. 
They may need funding a bridge to provide 
for stability over the course of the year, but 
they will emerge in an economy with pent up 
demand that once unleashed will create pros-
perity that is unheard of and that point they 
should begin to reply what they received from 
the treasury. 
This is not the case for working people who 
will emerge basically where they were and in 
need of consumable that were out of reach or 
unavailable once the crisis ends. 
The relief provided in this legislation is es-
sential if we are address and overcome the 
unique challenges posed to America and the 
global community by the coronavirus outbreak. 
Mr. Speaker, as of today, there were at min-
imum 552,598 cases of coronavirus across the 
globe and 85,755 in the United States, result-
ing in more than 25,042 deaths worldwide and 
at least 1,304 in the United States. 
On top of that, by taking the necessary 
measures to slow the pandemic and ‘‘flatten 
the curve’’ so as not to overwhelm the nation’s 
health care system, economic activity in the 
United States has experienced a severe shock 
to the system. 
Yesterday, the Department of Labor re-
ported that the number of first-time unemploy-
ment insurance claims exceeded 3.3 million, 
shattering by nearly 500 percent the previous 
record of 700,00 set in 1982 after the passage 
of Reaganomics. 
In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dipped to 
18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on 
Election Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 
mark where it stood on January 20, 2017. 
In other words, Mr. Speaker, all the gains 
that were made to the stock market and her-
alded by this Administration as evidence of its 
genius have been wiped out, depleting the re-
tirement savings and 401ks of millions of ordi-
nary Americans. 
So, Mr. Speaker, it is essential that this 
Congress act and act now to put in place 
measure that will address the public health cri-
sis, stem the economic onslaught, and amelio-
rate the suffering and deprivation of individuals 
and communities. 
The coronavirus bill that Senate Repub-
licans put forward this weekend was a non- 
starter and put corporations first, not Amer-
ica’s workers. 
It gave big corporations billions in taxpayer 
dollars with no real requirement to protect their 
workers’ wages and benefits instead of CEO 
pay, stock buybacks and layoffs. 
It failed to provide meaningful support for 
Americans losing their jobs or hours. 
And it certainly did not satisfy the priorities 
that were so critical to the constituents I rep-
resent in the Eighteenth Congressional District 
of Texas, which were: 
1. To provide increased funding for small, 
urban and rural hospitals under 150 beds and 
for federally qualified health clinics; 
2. Enhanced training and resources for CBP 
personnel where international flights land be-
yond the originally designated airports; 
3. Funding for airports that receive inter-
national travelers to allow for quarantine facili-
ties to be established and for medical per-
sonnel to be onsite; 
4. Funding for school districts to cover non- 
teaching personnel to make sure cafeteria

workers, bus drivers and janitorial services 
have equal access to resources if their 
schools are closed; 
5. Financial support for state and county 
governments and school districts; 
6. Enhanced funding for protective equip-
ment for Transportation Security Officers; and 
7. Reimbursement for telemedicine. 
Thanks to the leadership of we Democrats, 
the Republican corporations-focused proposal 
has been turned into a bipartisan workers-first 
bill and has now been passed by the Senate. 
Because of Democratic contributions, the 
legislation before us contains bold, pro-worker 
provisions that are desperately needed to pro-
tect the health and well-being of the American 
people. 
For example, I fought for $155 billion in 
funding to help hospitals in the fight against 
coronavirus, and won a $100 billion invest-
ment in hospitals, health systems and health 
research, and $150 billion for state and local 
governments in this agreement, to give them 
the resources they desperately need during 
this emergency. 
As a Democrat, I fought for and won for 
American workers a massive $260 billion in-
vestment in Unemployment Insurance benefits 
to match the average paycheck of laid-off or 
furloughed workers and secured an additional 
13 weeks of federally-funded benefits to be 
made available immediately, defeating a last- 
minute attempt by Republican senators to 
claw back the $600 in expanded Unemploy-
ment Insurance. 
For small businesses, Democrats insisted 
on and won a $377 billion infusion of fast relief 
for small businesses and made rent, mortgage 
and utility costs eligible for SBA loan forgive-
ness. 
For students, Democrats fought for and se-
cured more than $30 billion in emergency edu-
cation funding and eliminated income tax on 
student loan repayment assistance by an em-
ployer. 
And to protect taxpayers and provide ac-
countability and oversight, Democrats opposed 
and defeated Republican attempts to create a 
$500 billion secret corporate slush fund con-
trolled by the Treasury Secretary. 
This coronavirus legislation builds on the 
swift actions previously taken by the House in 
response to COVID–19. 
Three weeks ago, on March 4, 2020, the 
House passed H.R. 6074, the ‘‘Coronavirus 
Preparedness and Response Supplemental 
Appropriations Act of 2020,’’ which provides 
$8.3 billion of entirely new funds and commits 
more than $3 billion to the development of 
treatments and a vaccine available to all, and 
protects against price-gouging of medicines 
developed with taxpayer dollars. 
This legislation also provided $2.2 billion in 
prevention, preparedness and response meas-
ures, including nearly a billion dollars to help 
state, local, tribal and territorial health systems 
and helps families by extending telemedicine 
services regardless of where they live and 
supports small businesses, with billions in low- 
interest SBA loans to those affected. 
Passage of the ‘‘Coronavirus Preparedness 
and Response Supplemental Appropriations 
Act of 2020,’’ was followed 10 days later, on 
March 14, 2020, by H.R. 6201, the ‘‘Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act,’’ which en-
sures free coronavirus testing for everyone 
who needs a test, including the uninsured and 
increases funding for Medicaid to support 
local, state, tribal and territorial health sys-
tems, so that they have the resources needed 
to combat this public health emergency. 
In addition, this legislation provides two 
weeks of paid sick leave and up to three 
months of family and medical leave for eligible 
workers and enhances Unemployment Insur-
ance and supports small businesses by fully 
reimbursing them for providing leave. 
Finally, the ‘‘Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act’’ promotes food security for fami-
lies by strengthening nutrition initiatives includ-
ing SNAP, student meals, seniors’ meals and 
food banks. 
Mr. Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic re-
minds us once again how interconnected our 
world is and how an action occurring in a far-
away place can reverberate around the world. 
On December 31, 2019, the first cases of 
pneumonia detected in Wuhan, China were 
first reported to the World Health Organization. 
One week later, on January 7, 2020, Chi-
nese authorities confirm that they have identi-
fied the virus as a novel coronavirus, initially 
named 2019–nCoV by the WHO. 
Four days later, on January 11, 2020, the 
Wuhan Municipal Health Commission an-
nounces the first death caused by the 
coronavirus, a 61-year-old man exposed to the 
virus at the seafood market who suffered res-
piratory failure caused by severe pneumonia. 
On January 13, 2020, Thai authorities report 
a case of infection caused by the coronavirus 
involving a Chinese national who had arrived 
from Wuhan. 
Three days later, January 16, 2020, Japa-
nese authorities confirm that a Japanese man 
who traveled to Wuhan is infected with the 
virus and on January 20, 2020, China reports 
139 new cases of the sickness, including a 
third death. 
On January 20, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, di-
rector of the National Institutes of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, states that the National 
Institutes of Health is ‘‘in the process of taking 
the first steps towards the development of a 
vaccine’’ against the coronavirus. 
The next day, on January 21, 2020, officials 
in Washington state confirm the first case on 
United States soil. 
From that first outbreak of coronavirus four 
months ago, the coronavirus has made its way 
across the oceans and across the borders of 
nation-states to the point where today it is 
present in more than 145 countries and all 50 
states, including 1,456 cases and 17 deaths in 
my home state of Texas. 
As the poet John Donne wrote in ‘‘For 
Whom the Bells Toll’’: 
No man is an island, entire of itself; 
every man is a piece of the continent, a part 
of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory 
were, as well as if a manor of thy 
friend’s or of thine own were; 
any man’s death diminishes me, because I 
am involved in mankind, and therefore 
never send to know for whom the bell 
tolls; 
it tolls for thee. 
So, Mr. Speaker, we must act. 
No single one of us can do everything, but 
everyone can do something. That is why I 
thank the unsung heroes, the grocery staff, 
delivery persons, all essential workers; Thank 
You. 
Here is how I proceeded to join with our 
community to sound the alarm—so help could 
come earlier. But we will prevail, with hard 
work and the American spirit. 
On February 10, 2020, I held the first press 
conference 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
novel 
Coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Air-
port where I was joined by public health offi-
cials, local unions, and advocates to raise 
awareness regarding the virus and the impli-
cations it might have for travel to the United 
States from China and to combat early signs 
of discrimination targeting Asian businesses in 
the United States. 
On February 24, 2020, I held a second 
press conference on the International Health 
Regulations Emergency Committee of the 
World Health Organization’s declaration of a 
‘‘public health emergency from the outbreak of 
the Coronavirus’’ where I also released an Ac-
tion Plan calling for: 
1. Enhanced production of N–95 masks; 
2. Informing state health agencies and all 
federally qualified health clinics to test all pa-
tients presenting with flu like symptoms for the 
coronavirus; 
3. Increasing the supply of flu vaccine and 
use public service announcements to promote 
getting a flu shot to reduce the number of per-
sons with flu like symptoms; 
4. The federal Coronavirus Task Force to 
name a single coronavirus authoritative source 
for all federal information on the virus and es-
tablish clear communication links to K–12 and 
post-secondary schools, the media, and the 
public; 
5. Require that the nation’s airports, trains, 
and mass transit systems, both small and 
large, have in place response teams as nec-
essary to deal with and treat the traveling pub-
lic; and 
6. Ensure the federal advisory task force 
makes public reports on the status of the 
spread of the coronavirus, including by the de-
velopment of a computer app that provides up 
to date travel advisories regarding certain 
countries and basic information on the virus 
On February 26, 2020, I wrote the Chair 
and Ranking Member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security, seeking a briefing from 
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad 
Wolf to gain insight into the preparedness of 
DHS to address a possible pandemic. 
In early March 2020, I founded the bipar-
tisan Congressional Coronavirus Task Force 
with Congressman BRIAN
FITZPATRICK
of 
Pennsylvania and Congressman RAUL RUIZ of 
California and invited all members to join; at 
last count over 25 members have signed on. 
I have advocated to the President and con-
gressional leadership on the need for robust 
support and assistance that puts workers and 
their families first. 
And just yesterday, I announced the open-
ing of a wing at United Memorial Medical Cen-
ter in Houston that will house 46 new beds to 
treat coronavirus victims. 
Mr. Speaker, let me list briefly several of the 
many of the other salutary provisions of the 
legislation now before us: 
1. $150 billion for a state and local 
Coronavirus Relief fund, of which Texas is 
slated to receive $11.25 million; 
2. 4 months of more unemployment insur-
ance instead of 3; 
3. $6.3 billion for the Strategic National 
Stockpile for critical medical supplies, personal 
protective equipment, and life-saving medi-
cine; 
4. $10 billion for SBA emergency grants of 
up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for

operating costs once a small business or non- 
profit has applied for an Economic Injury Dis-
aster Loan; 
5. $17 billion for SBA to cover 6 months of 
payments for small businesses with existing 
SBA loans; 
6. $30 billion in emergency education fund-
ing and $25 billion in emergency transit fund-
ing; 
7. $30 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to 
provide financial assistance to state and local 
governments, as well as private nonprofits 
providing critical and essential services; 
8. $30.75 billion for grants to provide emer-
gency support to local school systems and 
higher education institutions to continue to 
provide educational services to their students 
and support the on-going functionality of 
school districts and institutions; 
9. Prohibition banning stock buybacks for 
the term of the government assistance plus 
one year on any company receiving a govern-
ment loan from the bill; 
10. Robust worker protections are attached 
to all federal loans for businesses; 
11. Real-time public reporting required of 
Treasury transactions under the Act, including 
terms of loans, investments or other assist-
ance to corporations; 
12. Retention tax credit for employers to en-
courage businesses to keep workers on pay-
roll during the crisis; 
13. Income tax exclusion for individuals who 
are receiving student loan repayment assist-
ance from their employer; and 
14. Eliminated ‘‘secret bailout’’ provision that 
would have allowed bailouts to corporations to 
be concealed for 6 months. 
Mr. Speaker, in 1862 Annual Message to 
Congress, President Abraham Lincoln wrote: 
The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion 
is piled high with difficulty and we must rise 
with the occasion. As our case is new, we 
must think anew and act anew. We must 
disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, the occasion demands that we 
rise, and I urge all Members to join me in vot-
ing to pass the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
748, the ‘‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act’’ or ‘CARES Act.’ 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR HOUSE AND SENATE APPROPRIATORS: 
Thank you for all your strategic and impor-
tant work on the Coronavirus pandemic for 
which this nation has never faced in its mod-
ern 
history. 
As 
we 
are 
aware, 
the 
Coronavirus is in all 50 states and any finan-
cial response must be significant and long 
lasting. As a result, I am recommending the 
following: 
1. Cash payment for all Americans up to 
$3000 per adult and $1500 per child. The cri-
teria should be based on national income lev-
els already designated or for individuals and 
families making under $85,000. 
2. Relief for the entertainment industry in-
cluding freelancers, independent contractors 
and those in the music, dance, and visual 
performing arts. This particularly impacts 
those in the gospel music industry due to 
concert cancellations and church closures. 
All these individuals are most vulnerable as 
a result of cancellations and closures. There 
should be a special account under the ex-
tended unemployment insurance which will 
allocate an additional $2,000 to the cash pay-
ment for these individuals whose income is 
generated 
sporadically 
from 
project 
to 
project. 
3. Development of a small business grant 
program funded through the Community De-
velopment Block Grant (CDBG) program by 
way of H.R. 6292, ‘‘The COVID–19 Recovery 
Small Business Grants Act.’’ This legislation 
is modeled after my Hurricane Harvey Relief 
legislation and it should include enhanced 
support for restaurants and bars. Add $125 
million dollars more to the CDBG account. 
4. Relief for non-profit organizations in-
cluding faith-based institutions who are 
closed due to the Coronavirus. They should 
be funded through the CDBG program. 
5. Small businesses who purchased business 
interruption insurance coverage are being 
told by insurance companies that they will 
not cover the Coronavirus. I am proposing a 
legislative fix to include coverage for the 
Coronavirus under the business interruption 
insurance coverage. 
6. The President has now invoked the De-
fense Production Act and it should be fully 
implemented after Members of Congress in-
sisted that production needs to be increased 
for personal protection equipment and the 
Coronavirus tests. Increased funding for 
Health and Human Services for these tests. 
7. Any support for the aviation industry 
should be with low interest loans. The air-
lines must agree to no employee layoffs and 
no share buybacks. There should be in-
creased funding to help the nation’s airports 
and the small business concessionaires in the 
airports that have unique needs as opposed 
other small businesses. Increase transpor-
tation funding that is going to be used for 
the airline industry. 
8. There must be increased funding to pro-
tect airport personnel, including Transpor-
tation Security Officers, through the pur-
chase of gloves, masks, and other protective 
equipment that they have not received. This 
is extremely critical as they are nearing 
complete depletion. Also, there must be ad-
ditional funding for personal protection 
equipment for Customs and Border Protec-
tion agents. 
9. Requesting $155 billion for hospital ex-
pansions to create more bed space that will 
be needed for Coronavirus victims. In addi-
tion, we should use the United States mili-
tary to help supplement hospital capacity in 
case of shortages. Specifically increase HHS 
funding for these funding items. 
10. Hospitals are indicating they will not 
have enough bed capacity to take in the ex-
pected large numbers of Coronavirus vic-
tims. Funding needs to be assured for in-
creased hospital capacity. Additionally, in-
creased funding to hospitals and healthcare 
providers for personal protective equipment 
for their personnel. The President quickly 
use the Defense Production Act. Specifically 
increase HHS funding for these funding 
items. 
11. Directives need to be in place for the re-
imbursement to health providers who are 
providing free testing. Before mass testing 
begins, healthcare providers must under-
stand how to utilize the reimbursement proc-
ess. Physician owned hospitals should also be 
covered for reimbursement for Coronavirus 
testing. 
12. There should be no foreclosures or evic-
tions at this time; upwards of 3 to 6 months. 
The President has indicated that should be 
applied to HUD-properties, but it should also 
apply to all potential evictions and fore-
closures. 
13. Funding for alternative facilities and 
relocation needs for prisoners to prevent 
community spread within federal, state, and 
local prison systems. 
Thank you for your consideration of this 
request. 
Very truly yours, 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
Member of Congress, 
Chair, Congressional 
Coronavirus 
Taskforce, 
Senior 
Member 
of 
the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee. 
PROPOSALS FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF 
PACKAGE 
To: Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Wendell Primus 
From: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, 
Senior Member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary and Homeland Security Com-
mittee and Member of the Budget Com-
mittee 
Date: March 11, 2020 
Below is my proposal for the Coronavirus 
Relief Package: 
1. Enhanced funding for small, urban and 
rural hospitals under 150 beds. Added re-
sources for their standing emergency rooms 
including training as necessary for patients 
without mobility to be tested at the hos-
pital. 
2. Increased funding for federally qualified 
health clinics. Resources to provide separate 
facilities which may include blocking off cer-
tain areas of the facility to provide for walk- 
in patients with Coronavirus symptoms. 
3. Enhanced training and resources for CBP 
personnel where international flights land 
beyond the originally designated airports. 
More assessment is needed to prevent per-
sons with Coronavirus symptoms from leav-
ing the airport into the general population, 
before medical personnel can assess them. 
4. Funding for airports that receive inter-
national travelers to allow for quarantine fa-
cilities to be established and for medical per-
sonnel to be onsite. 
5. Funding for school districts to cover 
non-teaching personnel to make sure cafe-
teria workers, bus drivers and janitorial 
services have equal access to resources if 
their schools are closed and financial support 
for those school districts that have to close. 
6. Financial support for state and county 
governments as needed. 
7. Enhanced funding for protective equip-
ment for Transportation Security Officers. 
8. Telemedicine visits should be covered 
with reimbursement. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. HUDSON). 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, these are 
challenging times for our country, yet 
throughout our history, America has 
risen to every challenge. Today is no 
different. 
I 
thank 
our 
President, 
Donald 
Trump, for his strong leadership during 
this crisis. 
I don’t like everything in this bill. 
While we kept out dangerous provi-
sions like union bailouts, the Green 
New Deal, and dangerous election 
schemes, it still has items I don’t agree 
with. And I worry about the price tag. 
However, 
families, 
hospitals, 
and 
small businesses need immediate relief. 
I am talking about a small business in 
Concord where the owner is doing his 
best but still had to furlough many of 
his 30 employees. He told me he can put 
most of his employees back on the pay-
roll using the SBA 7(a) loan program in 
this bill. 
It is workers and small businesses 
like this one that are counting on this 
legislation. 
It is not perfect, but I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Mrs. BEATTY).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1837 
March 27, 2020 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, the 
world is watching us. Today’s $2 tril-
lion aid is relief and economic security 
for all Americans. 
We 
worked 
hard 
to 
provide 
healthcare disaster needs and to ensure 
Americans, workers, and families come 
first: $350 billion in forgivable loans to 
small businesses, independent contrac-
tors, like barbershops and beauty sa-
lons, and more; first-time funding for 
not-for-profits and churches, which we 
must include minority-led and minor-
ity-serving not-for-profits; and $1,200 in 
direct payments to individuals and 
couples, $500 for children. 
The Nation is watching us. Vote for 
this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, as a Member of Congress, I 
have spoken with constituents, busi-
ness owners, and community leaders 
over the last few weeks who are appre-
hensive about their health and finan-
cial security. 
As a practicing physician, I have spo-
ken with numerous infectious disease 
physicians, scientists, and epidemiolo-
gists 
about 
the 
present 
COVID–19 
threat. 
While there are certain provisions in 
this bill that are not necessary, I would 
rather not dwell on its imperfections, 
and I will support it. 
Instead, I would like to thank House 
and Senate Members, as well as Sec-
retary Mnuchin and President Trump, 
for negotiating a bipartisan deal in a 
timely manner to provide relief to the 
American people. 
The CARES Act provides desperately 
needed funding for those who need it in 
this unprecedented time in this Na-
tion’s history. 
Families, small businesses, churches, 
and community institutions receive 
the funding that they need to stay via-
ble while we continue to fight the out-
break of COVID–19. 
I urge employers to keep their em-
ployees employed and access the bene-
fits that this bill provides to keep them 
financially afloat. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN). 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
virus is a machine gun machine-gun-
ning America. This bill provides $2 tril-
lion to bandage some of the wounds. 
We must stop the machine gun. 
Less than 1 percent of this bill goes 
for medical research. Our economic 
system provides significant incentives 
to the private sector to research pat-
ented drugs, but we should do more. 
The next bill should provide $5 billion 
to the NIH to evaluate every reason-
able research alternative, particularly 
those compounds that the private sec-
tor will not investigate. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. KUSTOFF). 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
CARES Act. We all know that the 
COVID–19 pandemic has greatly af-
fected the health and livelihoods of 
people around the globe. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect, 
but it is a solid step forward to pro-
viding the relief needed to revive our 
economy. 
There is no doubt that as a Nation we 
have endured tough times in our his-
tory, but we have always come back 
stronger and more resilient. 
I am proud today to be here rep-
resenting west Tennessee during this 
trying time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
we have never faced a public health 
threat of this magnitude. 
Hardworking people have lost their 
jobs and are on the edge of making rent 
or putting food on the table. That is 
why our rescue efforts have been fo-
cused on people. 
This bill offers additional unemploy-
ment benefits, injects billions into our 
healthcare system, provides billions to 
small businesses to keep their workers 
on the payroll, and gives every eligible 
adult a $1,200 check and $500 for every 
eligible child. 
However, this bill isn’t perfect. It 
leaves out immigrants who contribute 
to our economy, pay taxes, and are also 
on the front lines of this pandemic. 
This virus does not discriminate based 
on immigration status or race, and our 
response shouldn’t either. 
However, despite this shortcoming, I 
do plan to vote for this bill, and I urge 
all of my colleagues to do the same. 
Hardworking families are at risk. 
They need help now. Many lives are at 
stake. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN), the ranking 
Republican of the Appropriations Com-
mittee’s 
Homeland 
Security 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of this bill. 
To my colleagues in this great House, 
the people’s House, we have been here 
in times of triumph and in times of 
tragedy. This is the latter. It is a time 
for civility; it is a time for unity; and 
it is a time for us to serve the Amer-
ican people and pass this bill. 
Let our resolve be to defeat this 
virus. No malady, no virus, no adver-
sity will ever erode the great American 
Republic. 
God bless us all. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, our next 
speaker is another former member of 
the Armed Forces who has seen combat 
face-to-face and knows what crisis we 
face today. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with an incredible amount of 
pride to speak for the people of New 
Jersey, to speak for the heroes in 
healthcare who have labored around 
the clock to provide the best care in 
the Nation. 
I rise for those workers and for the 
first responders who are running out of 
personal protective gear. 
I rise for the brave men and women 
who are going through these tough 
times to help us: the grocery store 
workers, delivery people, and volun-
teers bringing food to the elderly and 
the sick. 
I rise for our manufacturers, our re-
searchers, and our State and local offi-
cials. 
I rise for everyday families, small 
business owners, and laborers who are 
losing their jobs and are not sure what 
the future holds. 
I rise for everyone in my great State 
to tell you that, together, we will beat 
this. 
In Congress, I will continue to work 
to get you the relief you need. In this 
Nation, we, as a people, have always 
come together in a crisis, and I have 
seen firsthand that this time is no dif-
ferent. 
I rise today to ask that God bless this 
House, God bless the State of New Jer-
sey, and God bless the United States of 
America. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SPANO). 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in favor of the CARES Act with 
optimism. 
On one hand is cautious optimism be-
cause we face unprecedented chal-
lenges, but on the other, confident op-
timism of what can be accomplished 
when we work together. 
We come together for those who are 
bravely working on the front lines of 
the fight: our nurses and doctors at 
Lakeland Regional, Brandon Regional, 
Southlake Hospital, or one of the many 
other medical providers across my dis-
trict. 
We come together for families, like 
the single mom who worked two jobs in 
Florida’s tourism industry to keep food 
on the table but now doesn’t know 
when her next paycheck will come. 
We come together to support the 
backbone of our economy: small busi-
ness. I have spoken to many small 
business owners this week who are des-
perately trying to figure out how to 
keep their employees. As a former 
small business owner myself, I under-
stand the decisions that they are fac-
ing. 
As a fiscal conservative, I am cau-
tious about this bill, but I understand 
the cost our country would pay with-
out it. 
When we face adversity, we rise to 
confront the threat head-on. 
For those in Florida’s 15th District 
and around the country, remain opti-
mistic because we will win this fight 
together. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE). 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, our Nation 
has never seen anything like the 
coronavirus outbreak.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1838 
March 27, 2020 
At a time when our American busi-
nesses are forced to close and American 
families face fear and uncertainty, we 
do what Americans do best: We come 
together and support one another. 
My background is business. I have 
run a small business and a large orga-
nization. This bill puts workers first. It 
is good for American business. 
It puts workers first with an addi-
tional $600 a week in unemployment in-
surance. 
It puts families first, funneling $1,200 
directly into the pockets of Americans. 
It supports small business with a $377 
billion infusion for fast relief through 
grants and loans. 
This bill is what the American people 
and the American economy need. It is 
time to come together as one Nation, 
united against this outbreak. I urge 
support for this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE). 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, a month ago, our Nation 
stood on the highest mountaintop, 
marveling at the supposed limitless-
ness of our domain. 
Today, barely 3 weeks later, awak-
ening from an abundance-induced stu-
por, we find ourselves deep in the val-
ley, peering perilously into the abyss. 
I hope that the safety net we are at-
tempting to purchase today with our 
Nation’s scarce treasure doesn’t dull 
too much the alarm that this crisis has 
sounded for our country to reform its 
ways. 
I pray that from this low point, we 
will seek out a great revival of faith in 
our Almighty God and a renewed com-
mitment to the principles of freedom, 
liberty, and self-reliance. 
For those in this Congress who have 
used this crisis to loot the public treas-
ury and serve special interests above 
the common good, I trust that our peo-
ple and history will judge you as harsh-
ly as you deserve. 
And today, I give thanks for our 
President. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Maine 
(Mr. GOLDEN). 
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Speaker, this 
morning, thousands of Mainers are 
staying home and doing their part to 
bend the curve in the fight against the 
coronavirus. 
But thousands of healthcare profes-
sionals, shipbuilders, grocery store em-
ployees, and many others deemed es-
sential got up this morning and went 
to work. They will do their jobs in this 
difficult time, despite the risk, because 
people 
depend 
on 
them. 
Congress 
shouldn’t be any different. 
We are about to vote on a bill in re-
sponse 
to 
the 
pandemic 
sweeping 
through our Nation and the growing 
economic crisis that follows it. 
Nearly 900 pages long, my office re-
ceived the text a little over 24 hours 
ago. I will be honest, many of us are 
still working to understand this bill in 
full, portions drafted by lobbyists with 
loopholes you might drive a Mack 
truck through. 
Only time will tell whether this behe-
moth will fully deliver on its economic 
promises. It won’t fully stop the deep-
ening recession. Only the loosening of 
the tourniquet will let the blood flow 
back into our economy, but that is not 
yet an option. 
I will, however, support this relief 
act. It is not a stimulus. It is an emer-
gency relief act providing $100 billion 
to hospitals. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
we are here today debating a massive 
stimulus bill, not by choice but by 
duty. 
The coronavirus is an unseen enemy 
that 
threatens 
countless 
American 
lives, a nuclear bomb to our economy. 
Yesterday, we learned a record 3-plus 
million Americans have filed for unem-
ployment. 
Workers are hurting. Small busi-
nesses are hurting. Thousands of Amer-
icans are sick. Health experts tell us 
we have several more weeks of this col-
lective suffering ahead. 
But there is good news, lots of it. 
Americans from coast to coast are 
pitching in to help the cause. Busi-
nesses are changing production lines to 
make ventilators and hand sanitizer. 
Surgical masks are being donated by 
the millions. We are lining up to give 
blood. Healthcare workers are being 
cheered like rock stars during shift 
changes. Americans are pulling to-
gether. 
Everyday heroes are emerging, the 
teachers teaching their classes over the 
internet and the doctors and nurses 
working 
superhuman 
shifts 
while 
friends and neighbors step up to pro-
vide childcare for them. 
We are seeing the best of America. 
Now the House must do its part. Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. SCANLON). 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the CARES Act, the third re-
lief package that will pass through the 
House this month, and we know it is 
not the last. This bill will help protect 
the health, safety, and economic secu-
rity of all Americans. 
I want to say that I am so grateful to 
our State and local officials, our first 
responders and healthcare workers, our 
postal and grocery workers, all of 
whom are fighting for our commu-
nities. 
I am grateful to our friends and 
neighbors for listening to our medical 
experts and staying home to slow the 
spread of the coronavirus. 
b 1100 
But they can’t do it alone. As the 
numbers of patients and deaths are 
mounting, our doctors and nurses are 
telling us they are working without 
the protective gear and medical equip-
ment they need. 
We need to end the disconnect be-
tween what the President is saying and 
what is really happening in America. 
We need the President to use the De-
fense Production Act to produce and 
distribute the medical supplies we 
need. 
I am so grateful to our colleagues for 
moving quickly to pass this bill and 
help the American people, and I urge 
the President to do the same. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a historic moment in the U.S. House. 
We need to pass an unprecedented eco-
nomic package that will prevent finan-
cial disaster for millions of Americans. 
We must get people working again. 
This bill funds programs for small 
businesses, including independent con-
tractors and nonprofits. It provides up 
to $1,200 for taxpayers who earn $75,000 
or less, as well as $500 per child. 
Additionally, seniors and disabled 
veterans are also eligible for checks. 
These payments will not be considered 
taxable income for 2020, Mr. Speaker. 
Most importantly, critical funding to 
provide personal equipment and test 
kits for healthcare professionals is on 
the way. 
For sure, this is a spending bill. I am 
not happy with everything, but I will 
vote ‘‘yes’’ to save the lives and liveli-
hood of my constituents. 
I ask for swift passage as soon as pos-
sible, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN). 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, think 
about the most iconic images from 9/11: 
Just after the attacks, people running 
away from the towers as our first re-
sponders were running toward the 
flames. It was a generational event. 
Today, as so many stay home, those 
who are running toward the crisis are 
our healthcare workers, our first re-
sponders. They are on the front lines— 
our supermarket workers, our truck 
drivers, our border agents and TSA 
agents. Right now, we are sending 
them into the fight without the gear 
that they need. 
We owe them our passion. We owe 
them to work together, Democrats and 
Republicans. Above all, we owe them a 
plan. 
Meanwhile, 
Americans 
are 
doing 
their best. Michiganders are coming to-
gether in ways that I could hardly 
imagine, from the Big Three autos to 
our smallest manufacturers, trying to 
fill the gaps. 
Today, here, we must do our part. We 
must pass the CARES Act. It is imper-
fect. It is the third appropriation. I 
hope there will be a fourth. But it is 
our duty to come together and pass it. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, the 
pain being felt in south Jersey and in 
this Nation is real. I have listened, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1839 
March 27, 2020 
I have heard the stories. What we are 
doing today will soothe some of the 
pain, but it is just the beginning. 
America was founded and has thrived 
with the idea that we are an excep-
tional Nation. We are exceptional not 
because of our differences but because 
of what unites us in times of adversity. 
This legislation is a testament to our 
strength that we show in that unity. 
While we must maintain a physical 
distance from one another to slow the 
curve of our hidden enemy, we must re-
main closer than ever in our hearts and 
in our souls to one another. 
I stand with my colleagues ready to 
fight this disease, fight for our fami-
lies, fight for their jobs, and fight to 
keep our Nation. 
May God bless America, and may God 
bless all of us as we go forward with 
our work. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the CARES Act. 
At this time, our country needs this 
Congress to act with a bipartisan com-
mitment to ensuring the safety and the 
well-being of our constituents. Al-
though this package is not perfect, we 
must support our postal workers. We 
must ensure our municipalities have 
the funding to survive. 
But it will immediately provide 
workers, families, health professionals, 
and first responders the resources that 
they need. 
Today, we can provide a direct cash 
infusion into our economy, and we will 
provide more than $170 billion in sup-
port to purchase the needed PPEs and 
give our hospitals grants to offset rev-
enue losses. 
However, our work is not done. As 
confirmed cases in Michigan and across 
the country continue to rise, I will 
work with my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to address the outstanding 
issues. 
And I want to say: God bless Amer-
ica, and we need to do our work. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise on be-
half of the people of central Kentucky 
in support of the most aggressive fiscal 
stimulus in American history. 
Founding Father John Adams fa-
mously said that every problem is an 
opportunity in disguise. This insidious 
virus, and the resulting shutdown of 
our economy, is a very serious prob-
lem. But because of the spirit of the 
American people, it is also an oppor-
tunity. 
It is an opportunity to support the 
heroic work of America’s hospitals, 
healthcare workers, and doctors and 
give them the resources they need to 
stay safe and take care of the sick. 
It is an opportunity to go to war 
against this virus, to unleash the cre-
ative energies of America’s private sec-
tor, and to help our scientists and re-
searchers find therapies, a vaccine, and 
a cure. 
It is an opportunity to give American 
workers, small business owners, and 
families the cash flow they need to get 
back to work. 
It is an opportunity to provide liquid-
ity and financial support to our mar-
kets to fuel a powerful economic recov-
ery. 
And it is an opportunity to come to-
gether as a Nation, not as Republicans 
or Democrats, but as Americans, to 
rise to the occasion, as we have done so 
many times before, to confront this 
challenge 
and 
deliver 
a 
stronger, 
healthier, and more prosperous Amer-
ica. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, can I get 
the time remaining for both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 22 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Texas 
has 31 minutes remaining. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. HUIZENGA). 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the people of west 
Michigan, for the individuals and fami-
lies who have seen their world turned 
upside down by COVID–19. 
Our neighbors, friends, and family 
members 
are 
losing 
their 
income. 
Small businesses are closing their 
doors. Manufacturers, big and small, 
are shuttering their facilities. All this 
is happening not because of bad busi-
ness decisions or personal choices but 
because of a virus. 
The CARES Act will deliver critical 
relief to west Michigan residents, small 
businesses, and our medical profes-
sionals. This package will help tens of 
thousands of constituents in my dis-
trict stay employed. 
While I don’t agree with every pro-
posal included in this bill, the vast ma-
jority of it will work directly to pro-
vide relief to the people who need it 
most. Communities across the Nation 
expect this body to act today. 
Finally, I want to say thank you to 
the first responders, nurses, and doc-
tors who are serving our communities 
on the front lines. Thank you to the 
farmers, the food processors, the truck 
drivers, and those stocking the shelves 
to make sure goods are available in 
this time of need. 
We are all in this together, Mr. 
Speaker. God bless America. Let’s pass 
this bill. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. BUCK). 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to oppose the CARES Act. 
I agree that we are facing an unprec-
edented emergency, one tied directly 
to China’s nefarious actions. However, 
as President Trump said, we cannot let 
the cure be worse than the problem 
itself. 
The President has shown strong lead-
ership, seeking to help struggling fami-
lies and small businesses. Congress 
must do the same. But we can’t do so 
at the expense of our children and 
grandchildren’s future. 
The truth is, this bill will spend $6 
trillion, not $2 trillion. Even that cost 
fails to include the cost of borrowing 
this money. There is no attempt by 
Congress to reduce spending elsewhere 
in the budget to pay for this bill. 
The sad truth is that most of this 
money in this bill is unrelated to fight-
ing the coronavirus. We believe that 
the fight against the virus will take 6 
to 8 weeks, yet this spends money dec-
ades into the future. 
While it is clearly necessary to do 
something to help our country fight 
this disease, this bill is not the answer. 
Our country needs help, but this cure is 
worse than the problem. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, at this 
time—just like I said last week, and I 
say it again this week—the COVID–19 
pandemic will get worse before it gets 
better. It will get worse for our public 
health. It will get worse for our finan-
cial health. 
That is why I rise in support of the 
CARES Act. With these shelter-in- 
place orders, we are continuing to try 
to flatten the corona curve. But when 
we do that, figuratively, we are putting 
our economy in a medically induced 
coma, a step that, as we have seen this 
week, has led to one of the worst em-
ployment rates in our history. That is 
why we need one of the biggest stim-
ulus packages in our history. 
The CARES Act will expand unem-
ployment insurance for restaurant, re-
tail, and hotel workers on the central 
coast of California. It will assist my 
specialty crop farmers in the salad and 
berry bowls of the world. It will pro-
vide small businesses across this coun-
try with the loans necessary to sur-
vive. 
With this bruising pandemic, we are 
asking our constituents to do some-
thing that is not normal: to stand 
down, to stay inside, to separate from 
one another. They are relying on us to 
do the right thing: to step up and to 
support the CARES Act. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. WALTZ). 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, as a fiscal 
conservative, $2.2 trillion of our grand-
children’s money is a tough pill to 
swallow. But this is a two-front war on 
our economy and on public health. 
On the economic front, we must pro-
vide a lifeline to individuals, busi-
nesses, and seniors that are suffering 
collateral damage. And on the health 
front, we must send reinforcements to 
our healthcare workers. 
This morning, I spoke with a physi-
cian and family member heading into 
the emergency room in Manhattan. 
She said she is scared. Like combat, I 
told her, you have to take a deep 
breath, stay focused, and do what you 
are trained to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1840 
March 27, 2020 
These hospitals are the Omaha Beach 
of this war. Colleagues, in the foxhole, 
nobody cares about race, religion, 
creed, 
socioeconomic 
background. 
They certainly don’t care about Repub-
lican and Democrat. It is about mis-
sion. It is about country. 
We have a duty to provide these sol-
diers what they need. We have a duty 
to support this bill. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BANKS). 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, over the 
last 10 days, I have seen the very best 
of America. I have seen restaurants 
Umi Seafood and Lucille’s BBQ in Fort 
Wayne deliver thousands of meals to 
those who need it. 
I have seen TNT Floral Shop in Co-
lumbia City deliver flowers to every 
nursing home resident in my county. 
I have seen many lining up to donate 
blood. 
I have seen so many healthcare pro-
fessionals put themselves in harm’s 
way on the front lines. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress 
to join them and bring relief to our 
neighbors who needed it yesterday. 
The CARES Act will keep the lights 
on in America. It will put cash in the 
hands of Americans who need help to 
pay their bills and put food on the 
table. It will give a lifeline to small 
businesses when they need it most. 
This is, by no means, a perfect bill, 
but it gets help to the people who need 
it most. I hope we will come back and 
make changes, as needed, in the near 
future. 
Mr. Speaker, in this time of national 
crisis, we must continue working to-
gether and with President Trump to 
keep our country in the fight. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
COVID–19 didn’t kill our economy. 
Government policies, however well in-
tentioned, did that. In just a few 
weeks, they have derailed the most 
promising and prosperous economy of 
our lifetimes and put us in imminent 
danger of permanently destroying mil-
lions of American jobs. 
The unprecedented spending in this 
bill threatens to destabilize the fiscal 
structure of our Federal Government 
and suppress future economic growth. 
But in order to deal with those 
issues, we must first arrest the damage 
caused 
by 
the 
actions 
that 
have 
plunged us into a recession. 
Temporary job losses will soon be-
come permanent job losses, without 
federally guaranteed loans to preserve 
those jobs and a way for families to re-
coup their financial losses. This bill 
does so, although inefficiently, waste-
fully, and at enormous cost. 
Despite all its flaws, passage of this 
bill is, therefore, imperative. But it is 
no substitute for getting Americans 
back to work soon. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to my distinguished colleague 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, since 
day one of this Congress, Democrats 
have committed themselves to a For 
the People Agenda. Today is no dif-
ferent. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is impacting 
people across the world, our country, 
and my district. It is for the people 
that we stand here today to assist fam-
ilies, uplift workers whose basic liveli-
hoods have been threatened, strength-
en our community hospitals, and sup-
port our frontline healthcare workers. 
We are here to deliver relief to peo-
ple, like the owner of a community 
bookstore in Andover, Massachusetts, 
whose business has been crushed; to 
keep our end of the bargain for the hos-
pital workers at places like Lawrence 
General, Lowell Community Health 
Center, and so many others who are 
putting their lives on the line each 
day. 
We are here for the families who are 
worried about their basic health and 
safety. This bill delivers for them. 
This is a time for bold action, and 
much more needs to come. 
For families struggling with the 
harsh realities of this situation, know 
that we will keep protecting you. We 
will take our lessons and courage from 
our frontline workers, from the fami-
lies banding together to care for their 
loved ones, from the acts of kindness 
we are seeing all over our country as 
we stand united as Americans. I sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining on 
both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 26 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Mary-
land has 20 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. NORMAN). 
b 1200 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, during 
times like this, it brings out the best 
and the worst. The best has been a 
President who is working nonstop. The 
best have been those businesses that 
are producing the masks and the things 
that we need, and the best has been the 
churches that are praying nonstop. 
Now, the worst has been the price 
tag, and the worst has been the things 
that were added to this that had noth-
ing to do with the coronavirus, the $25 
million for the Kennedy Center and $75 
million for the national arts. This has 
nothing to do with the coronavirus. 
This Nation shall survive. In the 
words of Winston Churchill: There are 
times when doing our best isn’t good 
enough. We will do what is required in 
spite of this. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, as I rise here 
today, the United States has more 
coronavirus cases than any nation on 
the planet. This is an unprecedented 
crisis that requires an unprecedented 
response. 
This bipartisan bill is a promise that 
help is on the way, that help is on the 
way for families with $1,200 checks and 
$2,400 for married families for food as-
sistance. For the unemployed, help is 
on the way with $600 in unemployment 
benefits on top of State benefits. 
Help is on the way for our seniors and 
our veterans of financial assistance. 
Help is on the way for small businesses 
through payroll grants and other costs. 
For first responders and hospitals, 
help is on the way to confront this cri-
sis. To our farmers and to our students, 
help is on the way. 
It is time to pass this bipartisan bill 
and send a message to central Florida 
and every American across every cor-
ner of this Nation that there is help be-
cause help and hope are on the way. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. KEVIN HERN). 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that this bill 
was delayed in pursuit of certain 
wasteful provisions that have nothing 
to do with the coronavirus. 
With that said, I am thankful that 
the vast majority of this bill rightly fo-
cuses on the needs of Americans. It will 
save small businesses in my district, 
provide much-needed funds to the hos-
pitals on the front lines of this fight, 
and provide the safety net for people 
who lose their jobs due to no fault of 
their own. 
America is hurting. The American 
people need us now more than ever. 
Thanks to Leader MCCARTHY and Presi-
dent Trump and the Members involved 
for their unrelenting work on this. 
To the American people, it is much 
later than anyone wanted, but help is 
on the way. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
May God bless us all. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COX). 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of today’s bill 
which is a bipartisan, good faith effort 
to begin to provide relief to millions of 
American families and workers. While 
not perfect, it is a good start. 
In the last few weeks, I spoke to 
thousands of my Central Valley neigh-
bors. Last week, I had a townhall 
where 9,000 constituents called in. They 
are scared. They are worried. But they 
are looking for guidance and leader-
ship, and today they are looking for re-
lief. 
No American should have to choose 
between paying rent and putting food 
on their table. But without immediate 
assistance, this is exactly the choice 
they will have to make. 
As a Representative of the top ag dis-
trict in the top ag State, I am proud 
this bill shores up vital safety net pro-
grams for our farmers and ranchers and

their families. But I am disappointed 
about this bill’s glaring shortcomings 
which must be remedied in a future 
bill. 
This 
bill 
punishes 
mixed-status 
households and denies some American 
citizens benefits they deserve. It does 
not put a penny in the CDFI Fund to 
help disadvantaged communities. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
have gone from a story that barely af-
fected Americans 3 weeks ago to a $2 
trillion bill today. The cost is too high. 
But the crisis in response to govern-
ment experts may be right and may be 
wrong, who said: Don’t fly, don’t eat 
out, don’t worship together, and don’t 
go to school. Our economy was shat-
tered. 
Was our President held up by irre-
sponsible Democrats and too many ir-
responsible Republicans for excessive 
spending? Yes. But we must act to 
calm the panic and move back to nor-
malcy. 
I flew here yesterday with five pas-
sengers on the only Southwest flight 
from Milwaukee. Usually there are two 
almost-full flights. 
Restaurants are shuttered by the 
government, and their employees are 
laid off. 
President Trump is right to act and 
stand up to the purists who have let 
businesses go under or don’t under-
stand that even the greatest of Presi-
dents have had to compromise. 
I am concerned about the unemploy-
ment benefits going over $900 a week— 
more 
than 
most 
Wisconsin 
people 
make. I want to help Americans laid 
off, but this provision delays the recov-
ery, and I hope Americans don’t bite on 
it. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. HARDER). 
Mr. 
HARDER 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, we have two obligations in re-
sponding to this pandemic: first, to 
move quickly and urgently; and sec-
ond, to put science and health ahead of 
partisan politics. Neither of those two 
things happened, but this bill is a step 
forward. 
It helps all the workers who have lost 
their jobs. It helps the businesses that 
are struggling with customers not 
showing up and staying home, and it 
helps the frontline nurses, doctors, and 
first responders who need more equip-
ment. 
There is more to do. As soon as we 
pass this bill, we need to keep working 
to make sure that we are expanding 
paid 
leave, 
expanding 
access 
to 
healthcare, and making sure that we 
continue to protect each and every per-
son who is out there as a first re-
sponder. 
Until then, I want to thank my 
friends from both sides of the aisle who 
are for working to get this done, and I 
urge us to pass it as soon as possible. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is in-
teresting hearing all this talk about we 
have got to do it now, we have got to 
do it now. It has been delayed since 
last weekend because of our friends 
across the aisle. 
Also, regarding the bill that we pre-
viously passed, it exempted the big cor-
porations we are now hearing are so 
evil. So we need to get our story con-
sistent here. 
But thank goodness the President 
put a travel ban in while some were 
trying to conspire, spy, and impeach. 
He kept being persistent, and, as a re-
sult, there are fewer people with the 
disease. 
Now, $2 trillion is vastly too much 
money, but I spent much of the night 
reviewing all of the sunsets in the bill. 
I am satisfied that most of them will 
prevent most of the waste, but there 
are some pet projects in here. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to turn back 
to the God that so many have turned 
from and then use the tools we have 
got to help those who have been put in 
jeopardy. I will vote for the bill. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), 
who is the Democratic whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me the 
time. 
I just want to take a moment to 
thank all of my colleagues for respond-
ing to what is an unprecedented event 
in the history of this country. Many of 
us who have studied history know full 
well that the country has been here be-
fore, and we have always recovered. 
The problem is many times that recov-
ery is uneven. What we have done to 
this legislation is created the oppor-
tunity to have a more equitable recov-
ery taking place, and I thank you all 
for doing that. 
The fact of the matter is this is a 
great country which does not have to 
be made great again. What we have got 
to do is make this country’s greatness 
accessible and affordable for all Ameri-
cans. This legislation makes an at-
tempt to do that. I would hope that, as 
we go forward, we will build upon it, 
and, when we come back, which we 
will, we will have an equitable society 
for all. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. 
ARMSTRONG. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
throughout our history, the American 
people have mobilized in extraordinary 
and unprecedented ways in times of na-
tional crisis, but the enemy we face 
today has required a different response. 
To defeat COVID–19, we have asked 
most Americans to do what comes so 
unnaturally to them: stay home. We 
have asked businesses to shutter, em-
ployees to stop going to work, and 
churches to close. Entire industries 
have lost their consumer base over-
night. 
The American people didn’t cause 
this crisis but are responding the way 
they always do: by being smart, tough, 
and compassionate. We owe it to them 
to give them this support. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this bill, not because it is 
perfect or even sufficient, but because 
the lives and the livelihoods of Ameri-
cans are at risk. 
This bill provides immediate cash as-
sistance. It allows for unemployment 
benefits. It puts direct money in the 
hands of small businesses who are 
struggling in my district. It creates 
$100 billion in assistance to hospitals, 
something Minnesota hospitals are des-
perately in need of, and it creates $150 
billion in funding, necessary funding, 
for State and local governments. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am going to vote ‘‘yes’’ en-
thusiastically. 
This is a big bill, but the American 
people are bigger. They will respond to 
the present threat as Americans have 
always faced grave challenges: as free 
men and women with deep reservoirs of 
strength, capability, and, when sum-
moned, duty and confidence. 
It is the duty of some to mobilize 
this government to backstop the econ-
omy; the duty of some to isolate, to 
blunt, the contagion; the duty of some 
to face the risk tending the afflicted; 
and, fellow Americans, the duty of the 
rest of us to mobilize the unstoppable 
force of the American economy to pro-
vide supplies, innovate technologies, 
and enlarge healthcare capacities to 
meet the needs of all and to defeat this 
enemy. 
With God’s help, this virus is no 
match for the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, because we 
are getting towards the end, can you 
give us the time that each side has re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 151⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Texas has 20 minutes remaining. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. MOONEY). 
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, there are good parts of this 
bill, the things President Trump asked 
for at the very beginning, like tax re-
lief for employers, help for those who 
lost their jobs, and funding for the 
medical community and first respond-
ers. I thank President Trump for his 
excellent leadership. 
I had a couple of ideas I would have 
liked to offer as amendments to this 
bill, but this is a closed process. 435 
Members of Congress can’t even offer 
amendments. That is not the way we 
are supposed to make legislation, espe-
cially when it spends $2 trillion.

H1842 
March 27, 2020 
There are parts of this bill that are 
unrelated to the coronavirus: $1 billion 
for Amtrak, money for National Public 
Radio and the arts. 
But what we are not talking about is 
how we are going to pay for this. We all 
agree about spending $2 trillion, but 
how are we going to pay for it? Are we 
going to borrow from China? Are we 
going to borrow it from Russia? Are we 
going to just print the money and de-
value our current currency? That is 
not being talked about. 
The interest on the national debt 
every year is already about half a tril-
lion dollars, every year, going forward. 
We could use that money to pay for 
epidemics like this and fund our 
troops. 
So, going forward, we need to talk 
about balancing our budget and paying 
for things. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BYRNE). 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, last week, 
3.3 million Americans filed for unem-
ployment. Small businesses around 
this country are shuttering. Millions of 
Americans and their children are at 
home practicing social distancing, a 
term that few knew 2 weeks ago. 
Countless others are on the front lines 
in our hospitals, doctors’ offices, and 
pharmacies or simply checking us out 
at the grocery store. 
Yesterday, I spoke to many small 
businesses in my district on a call. I 
was asked to give them hope. 
To the American people who are 
watching: There is hope, and help is on 
the way. 
There are many things in this bill I 
do not like. There are portions that I 
think are a mistake. But, Mr. Speaker, 
this is our time for action. Do not hold 
this bill up. We owe it to the citizens of 
this great country who are struggling. 
We owe action for them today. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, the last 
pandemic, I want to draw attention to 
the 
research 
investments 
in 
the 
CARES Act. 
The Department of Energy has funds 
for its high-end computing capabilities. 
The National Science Foundation will 
do molecular and cellular research. 
NIST will ensure the validity of and 
the reliability of the testing, and the 
EPA will do research on the risk of 
transmission. 
Mr. Speaker, my grandfather lost his 
wife and first son in the flu epidemic in 
1919, yet this is not the last novel 
virus. But with the bold, sustained 
commitment to science, we can make 
COVID–19 the last pandemic. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, our country finds itself in un-
charted waters. None of us have ever 
experienced anything like this before. 
For the past 2 weeks, I have been at 
home in the First District of Georgia 
visiting with individuals and with 
small business owners. I have seen 
something I have never seen before. I 
have seen people who are concerned, 
concerned about their health, con-
cerned about their future. Mr. Speaker, 
this is something we have to address. 
I have also seen something I have 
never seen before either, and that is 
people pulling together, people doing 
for each other, people caring for each 
other, volunteering at food banks and 
volunteering at service organizations. I 
have seen healthcare workers putting 
their own health at risk to deliver 
services. I have seen the best of Amer-
ica as well. 
Mr. Speaker, it is our opportunity 
here, our responsibility to help these 
people, to deliver to them. 
No, this is not a perfect bill. If I had 
the opportunity, I would change a 
number of things in it, but it is what 
we need to do, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, more than anything, 
what we need to do is we need to pray. 
We need to pray to the God of Abraham 
and the God of David. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend for yielding. 
This is an unprecedented moment for 
this country, and it is important that 
this Congress respond in a way con-
sistent with this threat. 
We have differences about this bill. 
There are things in it that many of us 
don’t like, but this moves us forward. 
This gives the American people the 
support they need in order to follow 
the medical advice that they are given 
without putting their families at risk. 
It supports small businesses. It puts 
money in the hands of Americans so 
that they can take care of their fami-
lies financially while they are taking 
care of their families. I support this 
legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
Act. 
This legislation takes major steps to 
support American workers and families 
during this unprecedented time. It pro-
vides increased funding to get our 
healthcare workers essential supplies 
and equipment. It also helps small 
businesses that have been asked to 
close their doors and sacrifice their 
livelihoods for everyone’s health and 
safety. 
This bill is not perfect. I am dis-
appointed that we are paying for things 
that don’t have anything to do with 
COVID–19, and I am concerned about 
inadvertent damage we may be doing 
to 
our 
seasonal 
businesses 
by 
incentivizing people to stay at home 
rather than going back to work once 
shelter-in-place restrictions are lifted. 
Small, seasonal businesses are the 
lifeblood of Michigan’s First District, 
and, as we implement this policy, I will 
do everything I can to prevent unin-
tended consequences from happening. 
The people of Michigan’s First District 
are resilient. We have survived hard-
ships before, and we will again. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER). 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support this unprece-
dented emergency relief for the Amer-
ican people. 
My colleague CHRIS
PAPPAS
and I 
have spoken with tens of thousands of 
our constituents through telephone 
townhalls and conference calls with 
hospitals. 
I want support for our people who 
have lost their jobs, for our small busi-
nesses, but, most importantly, for our 
frontline healthcare workers in our 
rural hospitals. We need supplies, and 
we need support. 
I thank you for voting ‘‘yes.’’ 
b 1220 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CRENSHAW). 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, busi-
nesses large and small, through no 
fault of their own, are failing. We told 
them to shut down and workers are los-
ing their jobs. 
Let me clear something up for every-
one. A loss of a job is a loss of a job 
whether from a large business or a 
small business, and it is devastating 
for families. 
Americans need help. Thankfully, 
this bill covers it all, from direct aid to 
accelerated loans. But when every day 
counts in a crisis, this bill was delayed 
by Democrats unnecessarily for a to-
tally unrelated progressive wish list. I 
don’t get mad, but this made me mad. 
And, in the end, the final bill today is 
barely different than last weekend, and 
the RECORD will show that. 
But we have it now, and we should 
pass it now. It will soften the upcoming 
hardship. But we must not be compla-
cent, for we have more difficult deci-
sions ahead: How will we balance the 
opening of society with the pandemic? 
It is a tough question, and we won’t 
be able to answer that question if the 
antics of this week continue. The coun-
try will move forward together as 
Americans, not as petty, opportunistic 
partisans. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. MEEKS). 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, my home 
State of New York has become the epi-
center of this terrible pandemic. This 
bill brings financial support to increase 
the number of hospital beds and equip 
our brave doctors, nurses, EMTs, and 
other medical providers who are our 
front line of defense and should not be 
asked to risk their lives to save others.

March 27, 2020 
This crisis will pass and our economy 
will recover, but American families 
and workers who lost their jobs by the 
millions, through no fault of their own, 
desperately need this financial support 
now. 
This 
bill 
provides 
important 
grants and loans to small businesses 
which will be critical to our economic 
recovery. 
There is more for us to do, but this 
bill is an important first step to secure 
American families and workers. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, when I 
was 5 or 6 years old, I had a Sunday 
school teacher tell me a story that re-
lates to a little bit of what we are 
doing right now. A small child went 
missing in the Plains States. The com-
munity went in 100 different directions. 
They didn’t find the child. There was 
no result. 
They 
final 
came 
together. 
They 
prayed to God, asking for wisdom. 
They ended up holding hands and walk-
ing across the prairie. They found that 
child. 
Mr. Speaker, this country needs to 
remember that, and this body needs to 
remember that. I think we need to put 
our partisanship aside. We need to quit 
bickering, and we need to ask Al-
mighty God for wisdom and to do what 
is right. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. UNDERWOOD). 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
CARES Act. 
Over 2,500 Illinoisans have been diag-
nosed with the coronavirus, 26 of whom 
have died. Countless more are in need 
of testing, and thousands of our front-
line healthcare workers are desperate 
for PPEs. 
Just this month, over 130,000 Illi-
noisans have lost their jobs. This is un-
precedented. 
The CARES Act provides immediate 
economic relief to individuals, billions 
in small business loans and grants, and 
improved unemployment protections. 
It will help States, local governments, 
and healthcare systems meet the enor-
mous challenges that they are facing. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), 
head of the Pro-Life Caucus. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, as of today, in my State 
alone, 6,800 people have been tested 
positive, with 81 deaths; and, in one 
family alone, four members of the fam-
ily have died. 
Containing the pandemic and devel-
oping and deploying reliable thera-
peutics and a safe and effective vaccine 
must be our highest priority no matter 
the cost. People, especially those on 
the front lines in healthcare, first re-
sponders, are heroically meeting the 
challenge offered, at great personal 
cost. 
The $2.2 trillion CARES Act is com-
prehensive and absolutely needed. It 
provides unprecedented support for 
taxpayers, small businesses, and grants 
to hospitals; it helps State and local 
governments; and it boosts unemploy-
ment and food security. 
Special thanks to all of those on the 
House and Senate side for their leader-
ship, for their cooperation on this bill, 
and to President Trump, the Vice 
President, Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, and 
many others who have brought their 
expertise to confronting this huge chal-
lenge. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. CLAY). 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the CARES Act, and I am 
so proud of the emergency housing pri-
orities, including a temporary morato-
rium on evictions and foreclosures of 
homeowners 
with 
federally 
backed 
mortgages. There is $4 billion for emer-
gency grants for homelessness, $5 bil-
lion for CDBGs, and $1 billion for 
project-based rental assistance. 
We are in this fight together, and we 
will not be broken. Viruses come and 
go, but the courage of the American 
people endures. 
God bless you all. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER), the 
chairwoman of the House Values Ac-
tion Team. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, we 
are at war against an unseen enemy 
our world has never faced before. We 
are 
battling 
on 
two 
fronts: 
the 
healthcare front and the economic 
front. Thousands of people are sick, 
with courageous healthcare workers 
battling on the front lines. 
Meanwhile, millions of Americans 
have lost their jobs because of the 
virus, imperiling family budgets and 
devastating our economy. 
Today’s bill sends needed battle rein-
forcements to both fronts. It provides 
funds to purchase more medical sup-
plies and to support our hospitals, 
while also sending much-needed help to 
businesses so that they can make pay-
roll and keep the doors open. It sends 
money directly to almost every house-
hold and supports those who have lost 
their job due to the COVID–19 crisis. 
Most importantly, it gives this Na-
tion hope: hope that we will get 
through 
this 
by 
supporting 
our 
healthcare 
workers, 
enabling 
busi-
nesses to stay open, and sending Amer-
icans 
funds 
needed 
to 
get 
them 
through. 
While this bill is far from perfect and 
the price tag is sobering, I believe we 
are in an unprecedented battle, and it 
is imperative we win this war. I will be 
voting ‘‘yes,’’ and I invite all Ameri-
cans to join us in this battle. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the CARES Act. 
Mr. Speaker, it would be criminal not 
to support billions of dollars for our 
hospitals and healthcare workers. It 
would be criminal not to support bil-
lions of dollars for our small businesses 
that will be struggling. It would be 
criminal not to support help for work-
ing families, $1,200 for individuals, $500 
for a child. 
But it is also criminal to leave out 
immigrants. They clean our houses and 
take care of our children and the elder-
ly. 
It is also criminal to shortchange 
New York, which has become the epi-
center of this epidemic. The delay of 
ventilators and PPEs has also been 
criminal. 
Remember, all of you: New York is 
your future. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I would 
rather die than see my country stum-
ble or fall, and, by God, I mean that. 
And I don’t think I am the only one in 
this body who feels this way. I have 
worried that, as a result of a virus that 
was born in a disgusting market in 
Wuhan China that was hidden from the 
world, our country may stumble. 
But I can tell you that that worry 
has subsided quickly for me as I looked 
around my own community and real-
ized, again, that Americans are a salty 
group of tough SOBs who are defeated 
by absolutely nothing. This isn’t going 
to defeat us either. 
There are parts of this bill that I 
don’t like, but I am proud that, when 
Americans wake up tomorrow, they are 
going to continue to know that we 
wake up here not as victims, but as 
people with a greater opportunity than 
anybody across the world: 50 stars, 13 
red and white stripes. We get to decide 
for ourselves if today is better than 
yesterday, this week is better than 
next week, this month is better than 
last month, and next year and so on. 
Nobody else gets to decide that for 
us. That hasn’t changed, and it will 
never change. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. LAMB). 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I know a 
firefighter who is going into sick peo-
ple’s homes still today with no mask. 
We all talk like this is war, but did 
George Marshall, a western Pennsylva-
nian, wait for U.S. Steel to join the 
U.S. war effort in their own good time? 
No. He used to say: You cannot fight 
against the problem. You have to de-
cide it. 
We 
have 
given 
this 
government 
money. We cannot give it leadership. 
Now is the time to decide this problem. 
Take this money, buy the masks, build 
the ventilators, and protect our people 
now. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
American 
Samoa 
(Mrs. 
RADEWAGEN). 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in overwhelming support of this bi-
partisan legislation. The country needs

it, and American Samoa desperately 
needs it. American Samoa has unique 
economic and geographic challenges. 
So far, my constituents are without 
any coronavirus testing at all, as NBC 
recently reported. The Army Corps of 
Engineers has reported our LBJ hos-
pital needs over $100 million, at a min-
imum, for improvements just to meet 
compliance standards. 
I want to thank the President for his 
leadership, and I thank my colleagues 
for including my request that the Pa-
cific territories and the Freely Associ-
ated States are in the definition of 
‘‘State,’’ so all pandemic unemploy-
ment assistance programs apply to us. 
Our people are strong and their faith 
is strong. Let’s get this funding to 
work and provide testing in American 
Samoa. 
Mr. Speaker, may God bless us all. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from New 
York—again, 
the 
epicenter—(Ms. 
CLARKE), who knows this firsthand. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
As vice chair of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, I rise today in sup-
port of the CARES Act. 
My colleagues have spoken about the 
provisions of this bill, and although it 
is not perfect, it is a necessary one. We 
must now protect my constituents in 
the Ninth District of New York, the 
epicenter, and all Americans across 
this country. 
New Yorkers have been through 9/11, 
the financial meltdown, Superstorm 
Sandy, and now we are in the midst of 
COVID–19. 
In my city, New York City, we are 
not just facing economic ruin, but also 
a genuine health crisis. That is why it 
is so critical that Donald Trump use 
the Defense Production Act. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the time remaining on both 
sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
DEE). The gentleman from Texas has 
101⁄2 minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from Maryland has 11 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS). 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge strong support for the 
CARES Act. 
For years, my colleague and I from 
across the aisle, ANNA
ESHOO, have 
worked to pass the Pandemic and All- 
Hazards Preparedness Act that was 
signed into law in June of 2019. 
For years, we have said it was not a 
matter of if we would have a pandemic, 
but when we would have a pandemic. 
That when is now. Now is not the time 
to place blame. Now is not the time to 
look back. Now is the time to act and 
to look forward. 
Now is the time to restore confidence 
in this body. Now is the time to pass 
this act for those healthcare workers 
who are staying at the hospital while 
they are begging us to stay home. 
Now is the time for all of those 
schoolchildren who are watching this 
body, thinking about and learning 
about this body, to show them that we 
can come together and govern. 
Now is the time to pass the CARES 
Act. 
May God bless America. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from the 
Northern 
Mariana 
Islands 
(Mr. 
SABLAN), who does such an excellent 
job. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, the legis-
lation we are considering to stop the 
coronavirus is not perfect. No legisla-
tion ever is, and we have more work to 
do. 
But even amid the crisis, we should 
not forget to say thank you. For the 
third time, Speaker PELOSI has led this 
House to respond forcefully to the 
coronavirus, to give healthcare pro-
viders resources, to give families finan-
cial aid, and to support workers and 
businesses. 
Throughout this unprecedented time, 
always the Speaker and her leadership 
team remembered that the United 
States of America includes the people 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
for that I am grateful. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. STEFANIK). 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, New 
York 
is 
the 
epicenter 
of 
the 
coronavirus crisis today, and I want to 
thank our North Country heroes on the 
front lines: our nurses, our doctors, our 
hospital personnel, EMS first respond-
ers, teachers, grocers, and truckers. 
The better angels of our nature are 
among us each and every day: volun-
teers coming forward, quilting groups 
in the Adirondacks, students using 3D 
printers, 
and 
mask 
making 
from 
Sackets Harbor to Saratoga Flag. 
This emergency bill needed to pass 
yesterday. It needed to pass last week. 
New Yorkers and this Nation need this 
relief immediately for our hospitals, 
healthcare heroes, and hardworking 
families. 
This country is a resilient nation, 
from the American Revolution to the 
Civil War, to the pandemic flu, to 9/11, 
we will overcome this. Congress needs 
to step up, do our job, and pass this res-
cue package today for New York State 
and the American people. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great honor to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES), again, from the epicenter of 
this challenge that we have as a coun-
try and the chairman of the Demo-
cratic Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, Amer-
ica is the wealthiest country in the his-
tory of the world. We also have assem-
bled the mightiest military. But you 
cannot judge the greatness of America 
based on our wealth or our military 
might. We should only judge the great-
ness of America based on how we stand 
up for the least, the lost, and the left 
behind. 
The CARES Act is legislation that 
will help provide relief to the most vul-
nerable amongst us. It will provide re-
lief to everyday Americans. It will pro-
vide relief to small businesses. It will 
provide relief to displaced workers. 
The coronavirus is a silent assassin 
and has targeted the American people. 
But we are a resilient nation. We de-
feated the Great Depression. We de-
feated Nazi Germany. We defeated Jim 
Crow. We will defeat COVID–19 as well. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, may I once 
again inquire as to the time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BROWN of Maryland). The gentleman 
from Texas has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Maryland has 91⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of the CARES Act. 
Even in rural southern Illinois there 
are 27 cases in my district. 
We need to come together in a bipar-
tisan manner with this bill to deal 
with: first, the health of our constitu-
ents; second, the health of their pock-
etbooks in this bill; third, those busi-
nesses where they need to go back to 
work, whether it is a small business or 
a large business. This bill does that. 
Is it perfect? No. But it is the right 
step forward that we need to do, and do 
today. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. CLARK), the distin-
guished vice chair of the Democratic 
Caucus. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
CARES Act. 
Americans are facing a public health 
crisis that is an unprecedented threat 
to the health and safety of our commu-
nities. Hospitals are struggling to care 
for our communities and get the pro-
tective equipment they need. The pan-
demic has brought schools, businesses, 
and whole States to a standstill, in-
cluding my home State of Massachu-
setts. 
Americans are calling for help, and 
today we will vote to bring them relief 
and offer them a lifeline, but it won’t 
be the end of our support. To those on 
the front lines—healthcare workers, 
cashiers, childcare providers, truck 
drivers, cleaners, and postal workers— 
and to all Americans, we say: We see 
you. We appreciate and are grateful for 
your sacrifice, and we will continue to 
fight for the people. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. WITTMAN). 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the citizens of the 
First Congressional District of Virginia 
to say that America’s glass is still half 
full. 
While we face this unprecedented 
challenge, we see across our Nation the 
resolve and the spirit of America. It is 
alive and well.

This is a challenge for us here in Con-
gress to show the same spirit and re-
solve, to get the job done for the Amer-
ican people. While this bill is far from 
perfect, it will demonstrate that we 
can come together and show what we 
have seen in the days past of what is 
going on across America. 
America’s best days are still to come, 
and we continue to be the greatest Na-
tion the world has ever known. May 
God continue to bless our great United 
States of America. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
the American people want to know 
that their government will be there for 
them. They want to know that their 
tax dollars will pay dividends for them. 
They want to know that we will pro-
mote the general welfare as extolled in 
the preamble to the Constitution. They 
want to know that we will not allow 
the perfect to become the enemy of the 
good. 
This is not a perfect bill. It is a good 
bill. I will support it. The American 
people need certainty. They want to 
know that we will be there for them.

Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. WATKINS). 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
behalf of the good people of eastern 
Kansas. 
The war analogy has been thrown 
around a lot these days. As a man who 
has been to war and spent many years 
there, I can say that is not altogether 
inaccurate. 
In both cases, people are frightened. 
In both cases, people die. In both cases, 
people discover what it is they are 
made of. And in war, just like now, 
people need to come together. 
This bill is an example of having 
done just that. It is not perfect, but it 
is what we have got. 
It has got my vote. I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ), a senior 
Member of the House and a cardinal 
from Florida. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, as a proud Floridian, I rise to 
protect our workers, health profes-
sionals, small businesses, and veterans 
from this grave crisis we face. 
Senate Republicans drafted a cor-
porate-friendly 
bill 
that 
failed 
to 
meaningfully support the millions who 
are losing their jobs. Instead, Demo-
crats secured a package that invests $2 
trillion in families, hospitals, and 
small businesses. 
Workers will get massive invest-
ments in unemployment benefits and 
an added 13 weeks of benefits, which 
Republicans fought to deny. 
Working-class families will get as 
much as $3,400 for a family of four. 
Small businesses will get help to 
make payroll, rent, and utility costs. 
I am proud that the Appropriations 
Committee spearheaded nearly $20 bil-
lion to ensure veterans’ health needs 
are met, whether at the VA or local 
ERs and clinics. 
Appropriators have also worked to 
ensure our VAs can assist our local 
communities if they reach full capac-
ity. 
This package is not perfect, and more 
help will be needed. But our families, 
small businesses, and hospitals need 
this help desperately. 
I ask my colleagues to give them this 
lifeline against this invisible enemy. 
We are all in this together. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, our next 
speaker is the former president of the 
University of Wisconsin, the former 
president of the University of Miami, 
and the distinguished former Secretary 
of the Department of Health and 
Human Services, one of our most 
knowledgeable Members about issues 
of families and workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
SHALALA). 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, today, 
we send the CARES Act to the Presi-
dent to provide the people in my com-
munity with needed relief from the 
devastation of this pandemic. 
I am here for the first responders, the 
healthcare workers, and all of those 
who are risking their lives. They are 
our heroes. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to support this 
bill now because we must. The virus 
has left us with no choice. 
But my hope is that after we have 
starved this virus, we will make a na-
tional commitment to permanently re-
build our public health infrastructure. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased that our next speaker is an-
other Member from south Florida. All 
three of them have spoken now, indi-
cating the importance of the crisis that 
confronts us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, as of this morning, the U.S. 
has the most COVID–19 cases world-
wide. Over 1,200 have tragically lost 
their lives. 
In Florida alone, we have over 2,300 
cases, with 652 in Miami-Dade County 
and 14 in Monroe County. South Flor-
ida is quickly becoming another epi-
center of this pandemic. 
We are watching how numbers for un-
employment 
are 
skyrocketing, 
and 
small businesses are closing. It is a 
tough reality to face. But we in Con-
gress can do something. We can come 
together, set aside our ideological dif-
ferences, and help people now. That is 
why I support this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Ms. FINKENAUER). 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the great State 
of Iowa where literally, just moments 
ago, before I got up here to speak, I 
found out we lost another two Iowans 
to coronavirus, now up to three, all in 
my congressional district. 
Today, we are grieving losses all over 
the country and the globe where, trag-
ically, necessary caution came too 
late. 
The package we are considering 
today is not perfect. It will not bring 
back folks who we lost, but it will give 
much-needed relief to our hospital sys-
tems and workers on the front lines 
and to our working families and small 
businesses across the country. 
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, can I have 
a time check? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 51⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Texas 
has 61⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ALLRED). 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
speak to the people of north Texas, 
many of whom are under Stay Home, 
Stay Safe orders from smart leaders 
like Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins 
and Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. 
I know many of you are frightened. I 
have heard from many of you who are 
worried about your family’s health, 
your job, and your business. I want you 
to know that we are on your side. We 
are with you. We will not let this great 
country fail. We will defeat this virus 
in a way that leaves no one behind. 
We should follow the examples of our 
brave first responders. Every American 
owes them a debt of gratitude. But we 
can best honor their service by staying 
home, if you can, and following the or-
ders that have been issued. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I don’t think anyone is happy about 
the present situation. But the free 
market did not close the economy. The 
governments chose that response to an 
exceptional risk to public health. 
The various governments that make 
up our country need to make sure that 
individuals, families, and businesses af-
fected by their unprecedented decisions 
remain solvent and that as many peo-
ple as possible remain employed. 
Like any war, the enemy votes, too, 
but the sooner we can get lower risk 
Americans back to work, the safer 
most people will feel. 
In our response, we must always de-
fend our values and the way of life that 
makes America the world’s land of op-
portunity. 
God bless you all. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. GARCI´A).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1846 
March 27, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the CARES Act, 
even though it doesn’t protect every-
one I wish it would, including all immi-
grants. 
However, it represents a bold, un-
precedented step in protecting workers 
and bolstering our healthcare system 
and in stabilizing our economy, espe-
cially our small businesses. 
That is why I will vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. 
DEAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
coronavirus pandemic is a reminder of 
our common humanity and our inter-
connectedness. 
I stand today to say Montgomery 
County, 
Pennsylvania, 
and 
Berks 
County, Pennsylvania, my home dis-
trict, have been particularly hard hit. 
There are suffering and courage in my 
community. We have had three deaths. 
I rise in support of this CARES Act. 
It is unprecedented. It is a monumental 
bill to send relief and confidence to 
those who are suffering, to our work-
ers, to our families, to our children, to 
our business owners. I am proud to sup-
port this bill. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY), the leader of 
the Republican Conference. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for the job you have done in 
the chair today. We thank you for the 
work that you are doing. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to 
say to everyone watching us at home 
right now, we hear your concern; we 
feel your anxiety; and we know what 
we need to do. 
When this year began, Americans 
were enjoying a level of peace and pros-
perity unheard of in modern times. The 
economy was at record highs. Unem-
ployment for American workers was at 
record lows. Take-home pay was rising, 
and business closures were falling. Our 
brave men and women in uniform were 
protecting us from threats across the 
globe. 
But a few weeks ago, we learned 
about an invisible enemy from a dis-
tant land, an enemy like we have never 
faced before. 
Now, the virus is here. We didn’t in-
vite it. We did not ask for it. We did 
not choose it. But we will fight it to-
gether until we win together. 
We will win because we have the best 
of our country on the front lines. We 
will win because of the other people in 
uniform: our doctors, our nurses, our 
lab technicians, and our hospital vol-
unteers. 
Take one moment and imagine where 
we would be without their fortitude. 
They have the toughest jobs in the 
world, but they are truly the best in 
the world. 
You, our medical professionals, are 
our heroes. We, this entire body of the 
Members of Congress, salute you. 
We will always win because of our 
truck drivers, grocery store clerks, 
postal workers, farmers, and warehouse 
workers. You are working night and 
day. You are making a meaningful, 
measurable difference in the lives of 
everyone you serve. You are the foun-
dation of everything we will do today. 
We will win because of our scientists. 
Their bright minds and faster cures 
should give every American peace of 
mind. We are developing a victory vac-
cine faster than ever in the history of 
any virus. 
On behalf of all Americans and on be-
half of all Members of Congress, I 
thank those on the front lines for their 
professionalism and dedication. 
Another critical front in our war 
against this virus is the home front, 
literally. 
To slow the spread, the government 
is asking—and in some cases requir-
ing—millions of small businesses and 
families to put their daily lives on 
pause and remain at home. 
I am overjoyed that so many have 
taken 
the 
imperative 
of 
social 
distancing so seriously. Flattening the 
curve is the most important activity 
any American citizen can do today. It 
is even more important now that the 
virus has arrived in full force. 
We are asking you to continue to re-
main at home as much as possible. I 
know this action carries substantial 
circumstances. 
We all saw that tragic news just this 
week. Mr. Speaker, 3.3 million Ameri-
cans filed for unemployment benefits. 
We have never experienced that before 
in our lives, not even in the Great De-
pression. 
What can we do for the hardworking 
taxpayers, their families, and small 
businesses, the pillars of the American 
life that are doing their part but facing 
economic disaster through no fault of 
their own? 
First, we can recognize that their 
sacrifices are an invaluable service to 
their fellow citizens. They deserve our 
eternal gratitude and prayers. 
Second, and more importantly, we 
can give them our financial support 
now, today, so they can weather this 
brutal storm in the weeks ahead. 
That brings me to the rescue package 
before us today, the CARES Act. 
If developing tests, treatments, and 
vaccines is America’s new arsenal of 
democracy, the CARES Act is our mod-
ern-day, all-American Marshall Plan. 
It is the largest assistance measure 
in American history, and it is going di-
rectly in the pockets of hardworking 
taxpayers, their families, and small 
businesses. 
For everyone affected by this virus, 
we will be your voice. For those who 
are battling the virus or who lost your 
job or who do not know if you will have 
one a month or 2 from now, I want you 
to know we are listening; we hear you; 
and we are working for you. 
I give Leader MCCONNELL a lot of 
credit. From the beginning, he was 
committed to a bottom-up, bipartisan, 
and bicameral process. He honored his 
commitment, and it shows. The Senate 
passed this bill by a unanimous vote, 
every Republican, every Democrat. 
It is bold, truly bipartisan, and tar-
geted to achieve the mission at hand. 
Our top priority is to keep Americans 
at work. So we aim the efforts to keep 
Americans 
employed 
through 
two 
measures. 
For small businesses and nonprofits, 
the bill provides 100 percent federally 
guaranteed loans for 8 weeks. If that 
loan is used to pay your employees, 
pay your rent, or pay your utilities, it 
is no longer a loan. It is a grant be-
cause we know what government has 
asked you to do. 
Other businesses get a retention 
credit to keep employees on. 
If, unfortunately, American workers 
find themselves out of work, this bill 
offers an additional 13 weeks of unem-
ployment insurance and dramatically 
expands eligibility. It also makes bene-
fits more generous by adding another 
$600 per week across-the-board pay-
ment increase through the end of July. 
The CARES Act also expands unem-
ployment insurance to cover gig work-
ers and self-employed and nonprofit 
employees. 
Additionally, for American families 
that might need a little extra support, 
you will start receiving and seeing 
those checks in 3 weeks. You won’t 
have to wait for months for financial 
help. Payments will be as much as 
$1,200 for an individual taxpayer and 
$500 per child. 
Finally, 
this 
legislation 
provides 
critical 
resources 
to 
American 
healthcare workers and hospitals, over 
$140 billion in appropriations to sup-
port our health systems. 
We don’t just talk about our respect 
for the medical heroes among us. We 
are going to give them the equipment 
to save lives and the tools they need to 
protect themselves. 
The reason for this legislation is to 
protect 
American 
workers, 
protect 
American 
jobs, 
and 
protect 
hard-
working American taxpayers. 
We are providing targeted, tem-
porary, and timely relief to Main 
Street, not Wall Street. We are not un-
derwriting bad business practices or 
priming the pump. Ultimately, we are 
laying the foundation for a rapid eco-
nomic recovery. 
This bill is not only a rescue pack-
age; it is a commitment, a commit-
ment that your government and the 
people whom you elected to serve will 
do everything we can to limit the harm 
and hardship you face, both now and in 
the foreseeable future. 
To the American public, if you do 
your part, I promise we will do ours. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, it is 
our responsibility to act, to put aside 
our differences, and to do what is right 
for the American public. Aid must be 
robust, rapid, and resilient, just like 
its recipients. 
We are going to help Americans 
through this. We are going to do this

together. In the end, we are going to be 
healthier, stronger, and more united 
than ever before, because, as Ameri-
cans, that is who we are. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the words 
above the Speaker’s head at the top of 
this Chamber are from Daniel Webster. 
He says: ‘‘ . . . see whether we also in 
our day and generation may not per-
form something worthy to be remem-
bered.’’ 
Today, we have something worthy 
before us and something to be remem-
bered. We should all vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
I am here to vote ‘‘aye’’ and to en-
courage the President to use the De-
fense Production Act for everyone and 
to continue talking to the President of 
China because this is a worldwide pan-
demic. 
b 1300 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House, who 
has been so critical in putting this 
piece of legislation together and focus-
ing on workers and families. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished Democratic leader, 
Mr. HOYER, for yielding and for the 
manner in which he has enabled so 
many of our Members to participate in 
this debate today. I thank him for his 
leadership on the legislation and also 
for leading us today. 
I thank Mr. BRADY for his leadership 
as well, for facilitating this conversa-
tion. 
I thank the Speaker pro tempore for 
keeping us reasonably on time as much 
as possible, for congressional Members, 
and for the strength of your authority 
as Speaker pro tempore today. 
I thank all of our Members for their 
participation on both sides of the aisle, 
for the seriousness with which we have 
all taken this important challenge. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, His Holiness, 
Pope Francis said, in his world prayer: 
‘‘Enlighten those responsible for the 
common good so that they might know 
how to care for those entrusted to their 
responsibility.’’ That is His Holiness’ 
quote, and that is the responsibility 
that we all have. 
Today, as we have all acknowledged, 
our Nation faces an economic and 
health emergency of historic propor-
tions due to the coronavirus pandemic, 
the worst pandemic in over 100 years. 
As I proceed with my remarks, I 
want to say to our colleagues who are 
watching the proceedings from their 
chambers in the House to come forward 
and come to the gallery and listen from 
here so that, when the time comes, we 
will be prepared to proceed. 
The distinguished leader on the Re-
publican side, Mr. MCCARTHY, and Mr. 
HOYER have sent a communication to 
all of you to that effect, that it is very 
important that you come now. The 
sooner you come, the shorter my re-
marks will be. 
I want to thank the distinguished 
leader on the Republican side for his 
leadership throughout all of this to 
achieve bipartisan legislation, and to 
do so as expeditiously as possible in the 
House—in the House—so that the mes-
sage will be clear to the American peo-
ple that whatever concerns we may 
have and whatever we want to do next, 
right now we are going to pass this leg-
islation, and that is because so many 
American families have been touched 
by this crisis. 
More than 82,000 Americans so far 
have fallen sick, a number certain to 
surge as testing goes forward and 
which is already the most in the world. 
We have gone past China and Italy. 
More than 1,200 Americans have trag-
ically died. It gives you chills just to 
think of it. 
Millions of workers are losing their 
paychecks, including more than, as has 
been mentioned on both sides of the 
aisle, 3.2 million Americans who filed 
for unemployment last week alone, a 
staggering, record-shattering figure. 
Countless healthcare workers, first 
responders, and others fighting on the 
front lines in this crisis are at great 
personal risk. 
The American people deserve a gov-
ernmentwide, 
visionary, 
evidence- 
based response to address these threats 
to their lives and their livelihoods, and 
they need it now. 
Again, I acknowledge the bipartisan-
ship in which we bring this legislation 
to the floor. 
Late Wednesday night, as the leader 
acknowledged, the Senate unanimously 
passed legislation which transformed, 
in our view—since the gentleman ac-
knowledged Leader MCCONNELL, I will 
acknowledge our distinguished chair-
man on our side—which transformed a 
Republican, corporate-focused bill into 
a Democratic, workers-first focus. 
We salute our chairs for working in a 
bipartisan way and in a bicameral way, 
across the aisle, across the Capitol, and 
we are able to dramatically expand un-
employment insurance and defeated at-
tempts on the Senate side to claw back 
the $600-per-week added benefits that 
would provide essential relief to the 
record number of Americans losing 
their jobs. 
I salute Chairmen RICHIE NEAL and 
BOBBY SCOTT for the work that they 
did on this—I know this is the work of 
the Ways and Means Committee—and 
successfully achieved full direct pay-
ments for workers, which is so impor-
tant, 
ensuring 
that 
working-class 
American families will be eligible to 
receive as much as $3,400 for a family of 
four. 
I thank, again, Mr. NEAL and Madam 
Chair of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, MAXINE WATERS, who, both of 
them, had bigger proposals but, none-
theless, advocated for all of this. 
By the way, I would suggest that, in-
stead of saying it is going to take a few 
weeks for the checks to get there, that 
the 
administration 
electronically 
transfer those direct payments imme-
diately. 
We ensured in the bill that any tax-
payer dollars given to industry go, first 
and foremost, to workers, workers’ 
paychecks and benefits, not used to 
pay CEO bonuses, stock fund buybacks, 
or dividends and the rest, and we have 
secured robust special oversight that 
will hold the administration account-
able for this. 
I thank the distinguished chair of the 
and Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee, Mr. DEFAZIO, for his lead-
ership in that regard. 
I will not try to find all of you be-
cause you may be in the gallery as we 
are encouraging Members to come. 
Again, I want to salute Congress-
woman WATERS for the work, having 
the oversight provisions in the bill for 
the account that is going to be spend-
ing money out. 
We are also proud to have secured a 
truly historic investment of hundreds 
of billions of dollars in hospitals, 
health systems, and State and local 
governments, ensuring that they have 
the tools they need to combat the 
virus. 
I salute Chairman PALLONE, Chair-
woman LOWEY of the Appropriations 
Committee, and Chairwoman DELAURO 
for making so much of all of that pos-
sible. 
When we talk about State and local 
government, I want to express pride in 
my own Governor Gavin Newsom, who 
was on the front line of attacking this, 
as well as my own Mayor Breed, who 
has disciplined us to shelter in place. 
For small businesses, I thank Madam 
Chair VELA´ ZQUEZ. Working in a bipar-
tisan way, we won fast relief for those 
in need, including by securing $10 bil-
lion for SBA emergency grants of up to 
$10,000 and making payroll costs, rent, 
mortgage interest, and utility costs el-
igible for SBA loan forgiveness. For the 
first time, we have grants from the 
SBA. 
Thanks to Secretary Mnuchin, he is 
facilitating this by not just all of the 
loans going through the SBA, but 
going through banks with the SBA im-
primatur, which makes this all go 
much faster. 
For our students, we have paused 
payments for Federal student loan bor-
rowers and suspended wage garnish-
ment and negative credit reporting 
during this time. For that, and for so 
many other things relating to our stu-
dents, I thank BOBBY SCOTT, our chair-
man of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. 
You heard earlier, all of these chair-
men make these presentations. 
For our veterans, we secured nearly 
$20 billion in funding to improve VA’s 
readiness with equipment, tests, and 
additional care as, again, 571 veterans 
and 185 employees have now tested 
positive. I thank Chairman TAKANO and 
others on the committee for their lead-
ership.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1848 
March 27, 2020 
For homeowners, renters, the home-
less, creditors, and consumers, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for her leadership 
there. 
Since the beginning of this crisis, we 
have fought to ensure that our Nation’s 
response puts families first as we go 
through this. So the first two bills that 
we worked in a bipartisan way on were 
about addressing the emergency. 
The first bill was about testing, test-
ing, testing, to ensure that everyone in 
the country would have access to free 
testing, among other things. It had in 
there issues that relate to research for 
vaccine, research for a cure, but many 
other things addressing the emergency. 
In the second bill, which also focused 
on the emergency, we had masks, 
masks, masks and many other provi-
sions focused on the emergency, but 
taking us to this bill today, which is 
about mitigation. 
As our distinguished Mr. DEFAZIO 
would say, first, we had the emergency, 
then we had mitigation. It doesn’t 
mean we are finished with emergency, 
but it is moving on to mitigating for 
some of the economic and health dam-
age caused by this pandemic. 
Next, we will move to recovery; and, 
hopefully, that will be soon, always, 
though, addressing the emergency and 
the mitigation needed. 
How are we coming, Mr. Leader? How 
are we coming with our gallery? 
As we have all said universally, and 
we say it almost all the time that we 
come to the floor, no bill is perfect. No 
bill is perfect. But we want to make 
sure that it at least comes part of the 
way to being sufficient. 
I do think that we should, when we 
are considering a bill, appreciate what 
is in the bill rather than judge it for 
what is not in the bill. But we do know 
that we must do more. 
There has been a constant commu-
nication among all of our Members, I 
am sure, on both sides of the aisle, 
when we were at home or here, with 
doctors, healthcare providers, labor, 
small 
businesses, 
nonprofits, 
faith 
groups, and scientists, on the daily 
needs and developments in our commu-
nities. Their on-the-ground reports and 
clear-eyed thinking have been essential 
to crafting our approach to all of this. 
So, again, listening to Members on 
both sides of the aisle and the com-
ments here today, as well as the input 
given in the legislative process, we 
know that this cannot be our final bill. 
Yet this bill, again, is, I think BOBBY 
SCOTT called it, a down payment. We 
must advance a fourth bill to address 
the continued needs. 
For 
our 
fight 
against 
the 
coronavirus, our State and local gov-
ernments will need vastly more sup-
port for preventing, preparing for, and 
responding to the crisis. Our hospitals 
and health systems still need vast infu-
sions of funding so they can treat those 
in need. 
We must do more for our healthcare 
workers. And this has been a current 
theme on both sides of the aisle, our 
gratitude for our healthcare workers. 
They are our heroes. We are thankful 
and grateful to them. We pray for 
them, but we need to do more for them 
than just to say those words. 
Our frontline healthcare workers, 
whether emergency, our firefighters, 
our law enforcement, face a dire lack 
of medical and personal protective 
equipment, PPE. Personal protective 
equipment, that is the reference. When 
you see PPE, that is what it is. 
We must ensure that the President 
uses the Defense Production Act to its 
full extent to provide the tools that we 
need to combat this crisis. Our workers 
are risking their lives on the front 
lines of this fight and need stronger 
OSHA protections to keep them safe. 
This week, for example—and we prob-
ably all have examples. This week, we 
learned of the tragic death of Kious 
Kelly, a nurse manager in New York, 
who died in the line of duty from 
coronavirus. 
He and his fellow nurses risked their 
lives without protective equipment be-
cause the hospital supply simply did 
not have enough. Nurses were given a 
single plastic protective gown to use 
for an entire shift when protocol called 
for a change of gowns between inter-
actions with patients. 
Other nurses were forced to resort to 
tying bandannas over their faces in 
place of proper equipment. And still 
others even began tying plastic gar-
bage bags around disposable scrubs 
that they were given in place of proper 
scrubs for extra protection. 
As Mr. Kelly’s sister said: ‘‘His death 
could have been prevented. I’m angry. 
He was healthy.’’ 
Now our nurses, doctors, healthcare 
workers, and first responders need ac-
tion. We have to make sure they know 
that help is not only on the way, but it 
is a priority for all of us. 
These people risk their lives trying 
to save other people’s lives, and then 
they take home what they interacted 
with in an infected environment. This 
is just asking far too much. 
Our families, our workers, our retir-
ees still need more money in their 
pockets to protect their income secu-
rity with increased SNAP. 
One thing we couldn’t get in the bill 
was the increase, the 15 percent in-
crease, in food stamps for our children, 
for our seniors, for those who qualify, 
bigger direct payments. I hope that we 
will be in agreement. I know that 
RICHIE and MAXINE had the idea of on-
going direct payments. 
Pension protections, we had a protec-
tion in the legislation. It was sup-
ported by everyone. The President of 
the United States supported it, but 
Senator MCCONNELL said he would save 
it for the next bill, so that is why I am 
mentioning it for the next bill. 
And then we need more expanded 
family medical leave. Let me give you 
an example. 
Come on, my colleagues, to the gal-
lery. 
Let me give you an example. If your 
parent is sick but had an ongoing care-
giver in the home or went to a senior 
health center on a daily basis and, be-
cause of the virus, that caregiver 
couldn’t come or that health center 
was closed, you would be able to take 
family medical leave. However, as in 
the case of many Members here, if your 
mom or your dad are healthy and they 
contract the coronavirus, you would 
not be able to take family and medical 
leave. What we would like that to say 
is for those who cannot care for them-
selves. 
It just doesn’t make any sense, in my 
view. So, in any case, we need that, and 
without exception. 
And 
all 
Americans 
need 
free 
coronavirus treatment so they don’t 
have to fear the high cost of a hospital 
stay. When we said the tests were free, 
it didn’t mean that the test is free but 
your visit to the doctor is not. 
So, in the days and weeks to come, 
Democrats will continue to advance 
legislation to meet the urgent needs of 
all affected by the coronavirus. 
I keep saying the coronavirus be-
cause, in this bill, people say, well, how 
come we didn’t do this or that? Be-
cause this is specific to the coronavirus 
challenge that we have. 
I just want to say a word about our 
children as I close. 
So many of our children, I want 
them, if they are paying attention— 
distinguished Congresswoman BROOKS 
mentioned the children. We are so sad 
for them that they cannot be fully en-
gaged in school as they were. Some 
have access to remote learning and the 
rest, and this has a deep impact on 
American life as it affects our children 
as well. I see that some graduations 
have been canceled and, hopefully, not 
so many more if we can get through 
this. 
As a mother of five, grandmother of 
nine, personally, but officially in my 
leadership role, I have seen hundreds of 
thousands of graduates, and what is ex-
citing about it, personally and offi-
cially, is to see the excitement of the 
families when their child graduates. 
When that family happens to have 
someone on the stage who is the first 
in the family to graduate, the pride, 
the joy, the patriotism, all of it is so 
exuberant. Many of them will be de-
prived of that experience, of seeing 
that child walk across the stage. 
So let’s try to get this. We have the 
best minds working 24/7, all hands on 
deck, to find a cure. Let’s make sure 
that we give them the resources they 
need to do so but, at the same time, 
that obey the science that says shelter 
in place or whatever it happens to be. 
So, as we go forward, let us pray, let 
us remember what His Holiness told us. 
What he told us was that we have a re-
sponsibility for the common good. 
So let us prepare for all the loved 
ones who have lost family members 
and others who are struggling with the 
illness now. Let’s pray for our heroic 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers who are risking their lives to care 
for the sick every day; the men and

Congress must show the same cour-
age, the same resilience, and the same 
strength and with great unity and ur-
gency put families and workers first. 
Let me again thank everyone who 
had anything to do with this, and that 
means almost everybody in this room. 
We thank the Senate Democrats, Lead-
er SCHUMER, and Leader MCCONNELL. 
Let us again return to the words of 
His Holiness, Pope Francis: 
May we enlighten those responsible for the 
common good so that they may know now to 
care for those entrusted to their responsi-
bility. 
With that, I hope we have the biggest 
possible vote for the American people 
to show them that Congress’ heart and 
the country’s heart is full of love for 
the American people. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
other speakers, and I yield myself the 
balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader MCCAR-
THY for his strong and relentless lead-
ership. I thank him for allowing each 
of us to bring to the table the pro- 
growth policies that brought about the 
strongest economy on the planet as we 
headed into this challenge. Thanks to 
our House leaders and to our ranking 
members on all the key committees: 
Representatives GRANGER
and FOXX, 
Representatives 
WALDEN, 
MCHENRY, 
COLE, and CHABOT. These are Members 
here today who have engaged in this 
historic agreement. Thanks to the pro-
fessional teams who have backed us 
every moment, night and day, in this 
endeavor. 
I want to thank our Democratic col-
leagues for working with us on this bi-
partisan bill and our Republican col-
leagues in the Senate. I especially want 
to thank Secretary Mnuchin, the point 
man for President Trump on these ne-
gotiations, as well as all of the Cabinet 
and the White House economic team. 
I especially want to thank President 
Trump for his strong and results-ori-
ented leadership at a time of unprece-
dented crisis for this great country. 
In times of challenge, I lean on this 
proverb: 
Fear 
knocked. 
Faith 
an-
swered. No one was there. 
Coronavirus has knocked at Amer-
ica’s door and with it fear. Faith is an-
swering. We answer with faith in our-
selves and our abilities, faith in our 
free enterprise system, faith in our 
amazing healthcare system, and, yes, 
faith that when the chips are down, 
Congress can come together with our 
President to help hardworking families 
and businesses when they need it most. 
We answer that door at this crucial 
moment with faith in our creator and 
faith in our great American spirit. 
This is the challenge of a lifetime, 
but if we keep pulling together and if 
we pass this bill today without delay, 
then we take another step toward that 
day when we answer the door and fear 
is no longer there. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of President 
Trump and the Republican Congress, 
we urge support for this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
As has been said so many times on 
this floor, America has faced many 
threats, some in the nature of attack 
by enemies and some in the nature of 
natural disasters, whether they be hur-
ricanes or tornadoes or floods. Ameri-
cans have responded and overcome 
those threats. 
We now have a threat, as some have 
mentioned, that is unseen but has a 
great effect and is having a great effect 
today as we debate this bill in Amer-
ica. 
Today we will vote not as Democrats 
or Republicans but we will vote as 
Americans who have been sent here to 
represent our country and our people 
to promote the general welfare. Cer-
tainly the general welfare has been put 
at risk by this virus. 
We have in a very short time passed 
three major pieces of legislation, two 
that generated in this House and one 
that generated in the Senate. We will 
pass this bill today. I want to thank 
the majority leader—excuse me—the 
minority leader. I am the majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. I will take it back. 
Mr. HOYER. You can’t have it. 
While we enjoy a little levity, we un-
derstand the gravity of this situation. 
People will die today as a result of this 
virus. 
We have come together as Democrats 
and Republicans from every region of 
this country to respond in a way suffi-
cient for the challenge, and we know 
we will need to do more. But this day 
let us hope that like the United States 
Senate we come together each and 
every one of us not for partisan advan-
tage but for the advantage and defense 
of our people. 
America has been blessed by God and 
by our people. Let us respond this hour 
to their need in their defense so that 
America will go forward stronger, bet-
ter, and more ready to face future chal-
lenges. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify a 
provision in the bill we passed this morning, 
the Cares Act, that provides relief to states. 
With state revenues decreasing at the same 
time that demand for services is rising, there 
has been broad agreement in the House that 
something needs to be done to help states 
cope with funding shortfalls. Our legislation 
creates a Coronavirus Relief Fund to provide 
additional resources to states, local govern-
ments, and tribes to address costs incurred re-
sponding to the coronavirus pandemic. I am 
pleased that the final legislative language 
gives states broad flexibility in how they spend 
the money they will receive. 
Some state leaders have expressed con-
cern that a provision requiring that funds be 
spent only on newly identified needs could 
prevent states from using this new funding for 
legitimate needs relating to the current public 
health emergency just because the state’s 
regular budget addresses similar spending 
needs. That is not the intent of the language 
in our bill. To be clear, we intended for the 
language to give states, localities, and tribes 
broad flexibility to address needs arising from 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic, 
regardless 
of 
whether the need arises directly from new 
spending related to the outbreak or indirectly 
as a result of collapsing state revenues, as 
businesses shut down to support social 
distancing and protect public health. 
I am encouraged that the Treasury Depart-
ment has indicated that it appreciates the im-
portance of providing this funding to states 
quickly, flexibly, and with a minimum of paper-
work. It is critically important that the federal 
government give states the tools they need si-
multaneously to address the public health cri-
sis as well as the economic damage it is caus-
ing. 
In this same vein, I would be remiss if I did 
not, once again, express my profound dis-
appointment that this provision treats the Dis-
trict of Columbia as a territory rather than a 
state. This misguided decision by the Senate 
will shortchange the District by hundreds of 
millions of dollars, hurting the National Capital 
Region’s 
coordinated 
effort 
to 
fight 
the 
coronavirus. I am committed to fixing this 
issue in whatever legislation we consider next 
to address the coronavirus. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, at this historic 
moment for our beloved nation, we come to-
gether to pass the largest federal boost to our 
economy in modem history. This package is 
‘‘For Our People.’’ It will save lives and our 
economy. 
Let me begin with a heartfelt thank you to 
our first responders, medical workers, grocery 
store workers, field hands and migrant work-
ers, municipal employees, drug store and 
pharmacy employees, food bank volunteers, 
truck drivers and delivery workers, and the US 
Army Corps of Engineers, National Guard per-
sonnel, and non-profit Samaritans and volun-
teers of every persuasion helping across 
America. Each of your tireless efforts and 
dedication make this nation stronger. 
Our country is under attack by an invisible 
foe. We have not experienced a threat of this 
magnitude since Pearl Harbor when our nation 
found itself quite ill-prepared to meet foreign 
foes. Today, we vote on a $2.3 trillion re-
sponse package that recognizes the medical 
and economic horrors confronting the Amer-
ican people. This legislation provides assur-
ance and support to those who need healing 
and a bridge toward a more secure future. 
To America’s medical frontline, our families, 
workers, seniors, and small businesses, we 
have heard your pleas for rescue. Today we 
provide a lifeline. 
Because of Democratic efforts, huge invest-
ments in hospitals, health systems and state 
and local government will receive the re-
sources they desperately need to meet this 
pandemic. 
Democratic efforts won significant increases 
in unemployment insurance benefits to match 
average paychecks of laid-off or furloughed 
workers, and direct cash payments to millions. 
Democratic pressure led to significant ex-
pansion of fast relief for small businesses and

made rent, mortgages, and utility costs eligible 
for SBA loan forgiveness. 
Because of Democratic leadership, students 
will have billions for emergency education 
funding and student loans will not bear income 
tax on repayment assistance provided by an 
employer. 
And most importantly, spending of the tax-
payer dollars will be held accountable with 
oversight, preventing secret bailouts to the 
wealthiest friends of this Administration. 
This legislation is bold. But is not an imme-
diate cure all. More action is required soon. 
This global pandemic exposed the reality 
the Heartland of our nation has known for dec-
ades. We cannot rely on foreign manufac-
turing for vital, daily essentials, surely medical 
supplies. It is overtime for this Administration 
to bring the full force of the Defense Produc-
tion Act online, but more importantly to then 
partner with Congress to rebuild America’s se-
curity through domestic manufacturing. 
Too many Americans have already lost their 
lives in this crisis because of missed warnings, 
ignored alarms, and disregard for our indus-
trial base and vital medical supply lines. With 
Congress next turning to a legislative solution 
to provide robust economic recovery, we can-
not ignore the elephant in the room. 
We must do everything to rebuild our stra-
tegic medical stockpile through American man-
ufacturing ingenuity. American lives are at 
stake now and in the future. We make Amer-
ica great again by healing her people and re-
building her domestic medical production. 
I fully support today’s response package 
and urge all my colleagues to do so. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely 
critical for Congress to take action to provide 
relief and assistance to the millions of people 
across the nation who are struggling in the 
midst of this national public health and eco-
nomic emergency. I rise today to support the 
Senate Amendment to H.R. 748, now referred 
to as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act or CARES Act, and to ad-
dress several key issues. The legislation be-
fore us takes important steps to support con-
sumers, renters, homeowners and people ex-
periencing homelessness, to address the 
shortage of key medical supplies and equip-
ment, to assist small businesses and local, 
territory and state governments, and to ensure 
that any federal aid to corporations has condi-
tions and independent oversight. While it is 
clear that Congress must continue to take ac-
tion to respond to and address this crisis, the 
passage of this bill is much needed for fami-
lies and communities in the United States. 
The first draft of the Senate Republican bill 
failed to include important relief for con-
sumers, homeowners, renters, and people ex-
periencing homelessness. Thankfully, after I, 
and other Democrats spoke out about the lack 
of homeless assistance in the first package for 
Coronavirus relief, this bill now includes $4 bil-
lion for homeless assistance. There are over 
half a million people experiencing homeless-
ness in America and the limited accommoda-
tion they have access to is often in emergency 
shelter facilities that have several beds in a 
single room. These cramped facilities are 
prime conditions for the spread of a virus, and 
people experiencing homelessness are also 
more vulnerable in that they often have limited 
access to health care services. Congress ex-
pects that the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD) will prioritize this 
vulnerable population in delivering assistance. 
This bill also includes a temporary morato-
rium on eviction filings for renters who are liv-
ing in properties with federal backing or sub-
sidies, as well as targeted rent relief for feder-
ally assisted renters. I continue to have con-
cerns about other renters, particularly lower in-
come renters who will not benefit from these 
provisions. The House bill, H.R. 6379, the 
Take Responsibility for Workers and Families 
Act, provided a $100 billion emergency rental 
assistance fund to help renters in paying their 
rent and utilities. Congress needs provide 
such assistance in a future package. 
Homeowners with federally backed loans 
will also get relief under this bill through a 
foreclosure moratorium and mortgage forbear-
ance. Multifamily rental property owners with 
federally backed mortgages will also receive 
forbearance. I continue to have concerns 
about homeowners and rental property owners 
with mortgages that do not have federal back-
ing and therefore will be excluded from this re-
lief. I’m also concerned that the bill provides 
no funding for rural housing programs. Con-
gress expects financial institutions, mortgage 
servicers, and landlords to ensure they are in 
compliance with the law and promptly provide 
clear and accessible notices to tenants and 
homeowners about their eligibility for relief 
under the law. 
While mortgage servicers have expressed 
concerns that they will not be eligible to ac-
cess a Federal Reserve facility to ensure that 
businesses have access to financing, I believe 
that H.R. 748 is clear that mortgage servicers, 
like other businesses, are eligible for this fi-
nancing. Indeed, the Federal Reserve already 
has sufficient authority to create a facility to 
ensure that mortgage servicers have liquidity. 
H.R. 748 builds on those authorities to ensure 
the Federal Reserve is responsive to this cri-
sis and its actions complement other provi-
sions in the bill, so Congress expects the Fed 
will act promptly to establish and implement 
this facility. Congress also expects that the 
Secretaries of Treasury and HUD, as well as 
the Director of the Federal Housing Finance 
Agency will use their robust authorities pro-
vided in the legislation and current law to en-
sure that the time periods allotted for fore-
closure moratorium and forbearance are long 
enough to provide sufficient relief. We do not 
want homeowners to be forced to resume 
making payments when the worst economic 
impacts of the crisis have yet to subside. 
This bill also includes $4 billion in Commu-
nity Development Block Grant funding to pro-
vide states and localities with flexible funding 
to address various community needs associ-
ated with COVID–19, including the provision of 
mobile health clinics. There is also $10 million 
to ensure that elderly households living in 
HUD-assisted housing have access to service 
coordinators and $2.5 million for fair housing 
enforcement and education. Congress has 
seen that in the aftermath of disasters, federal 
relief funding has often been spent in ways 
that discriminate against minorities and other 
protected classes of people. These additional 
funds are provided to focus the Federal re-
sponse on ensuring that the funding in this bill 
is spent in ways that are not discriminatory. 
Democrats pushed to ensure the bill helps 
struggling student loan borrowers. The final bill 
pauses payments and suspends debt collec-
tion on most federal student loans until Sep-
tember 30th. It prohibits garnishment, tax sei-
zure, benefits reduction, and interest accrual 
on most federal student loans, allowing bor-
rowers to remain current for credit reporting 
and loan forgiveness program purposes. How-
ever, the bill does not provide similar relief for 
private student loan borrowers. It also does 
not provide any forgiveness of student loan 
debt. H.R. 6379 provided payment relief, debt 
forgiveness, and student loan forgiveness for 
federal and private student loan borrowers. 
Debt forgiveness and parity for private student 
loan borrowers should be addressed in any 
subsequent bill. 
I also believe we need to ensure that all 
Americans have access to the medical sup-
plies 
they 
need. 
The 
bill 
includes 
$1,000,000,000 in additional funding for the 
Defense Production Act (DPA). The DPA pro-
vides emergency authority to prioritize con-
tracts for essential materials, allocate scarce 
items to key industries, and provide incentives 
to companies to change production lines to 
provide items that are in need. In times of cri-
sis, this authority ensures that U.S. production 
fulfills the crucial needs of the moment. 
We are in such a crisis where this authority 
is needed. There are countless reports of 
shortages of personal protection equipment, 
such as masks and gowns, and other life-sav-
ing items, such as ventilators. As we begin to 
ramp up critical diagnostic testing for larger 
and larger parts of our population, our medical 
personnel are facing shortages of this critical 
equipment. Without additional supplies, we 
cannot safely protect our frontline medical pro-
fessionals so that they can administer the very 
tests that can make a key difference in com-
batting this deadly virus. 
Congress is providing the increase of fund-
ing to carry out the Defense Production Act 
with the understanding that these funds are to 
be used to help expand our domestic produc-
tive capacity for critically needed medical sup-
plies or equipment, to purchase such supplies 
or equipment where necessary and to address 
other needs that directly relate to meeting the 
emergency medical needs arising directly from 
the COVID–19 pandemic. The Administration 
should use the funding provided in the bill to 
increase domestic productive capacity for such 
supplies and equipment by, for example, ex-
panding a company’s manufacturing capability 
through the purchase, retrofit, or installation of 
equipment; developing a producer’s ability to 
be able to surge production as needed; mak-
ing purchasing agreements to ensure that a 
company’s manufacturing capacity will be eco-
nomically sustainable; and/or making various 
financial instruments available (such as direct 
investments, loans, and loan guarantees) to 
enable any of these uses. If there are other 
critical needs that come out of this crisis 
where DPA funding would be necessary, the 
Committee on Financial Services, which has 
jurisdiction over this authority, should be con-
sulted prior entering into any commitment to 
grants, loans, or purchases using this funding. 
As the Chairwoman of the Committee with 
jurisdiction over the Defense Production Act, I 
will be reviewing both FEMA and HHS’s ef-
forts to use the authorities of the Defense Pro-
duction Act, and I will be closely examining 
how this new $1,000,000,000 is going to be 
used to ensure the health and safety of people 
living in the United States. 
States, territories, and municipalities are on 
the frontlines of responding to this pandemic. 
Hospitals are already experiencing severe 
supply shortages, and there aren’t enough

hospital beds or health care workers to get pa-
tients suffering from this virus what they need. 
It is absolutely critical that we support our 
local governments as they respond to the cri-
sis and other unanticipated expenses—espe-
cially in the face of sharply rising interest rates 
on municipal bonds and declining local gov-
ernment sales tax revenue. In addition to $150 
billion in grants to states and cities in this bill, 
H.R. 748 authorizes the Treasury Department 
to provide financing to a Federal Reserve fa-
cility that would support states and municipal 
government financing, including through the 
purchase of longer dated maturity bonds. The 
bill also instructs the Treasury Secretary to en-
deavor to lend through the Federal Reserve’s 
facility to states and cities to help them meet 
the huge needs they will see in the months 
ahead. Given how urgent the needs are, Con-
gress expects this program to be stood up 
quickly, and for the support that it provides for 
state and local borrowing to be robust, includ-
ing through the direct purchase of new debt 
issuances and long-dated municipal securities. 
The small businesses in this country form 
the backbone of our nation’s economy. This 
bill provides major funding to ensure small 
businesses are able to continue to serve their 
local communities during these difficult times. 
The final bill includes loan forgiveness to small 
businesses for expenses related to utilities, 
rent, interest on mortgages, and payroll, which 
should help struggling small businesses will 
have access to funds to cover their immediate 
costs. There are also funds available that 
Treasury and the Federal Reserve can and 
should immediately deploy to support small 
businesses, and we will be examining closely 
how these provisions are implemented. 
The financial crisis of 2008 left millions of 
Americans stretched financially, especially 
women, minorities, and diverse-owned busi-
nesses. Unfortunately, many of them are still 
recovering from the last crisis and will be vul-
nerable to any negative impacts as a result of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. I am pleased that 
this legislation includes $10 million for the Mi-
nority Business Development Administration. 
MBDA will be able to direct funding to its mi-
nority business development centers, which 
provide local support directly to minority busi-
nesses within the communities they serve. 
These funds should be quickly deployed. Con-
gress should be mindful that $10 million is 
only a down payment, and more funding is 
needed for grants and other assistance to pro-
vide access to capital for minority businesses 
to ensure they do not continue to be left out 
and further behind. 
Community banks and credit unions are 
playing a vital role as we endure and eventu-
ally move past this pandemic. This bill reau-
thorizes the Transaction Account Guarantee 
(TAG) Program, a successful financial crisis 
era program established to maintain con-
fidence in our nation’s banking system, includ-
ing minority depository institutions (MDIs), 
community banks, and credit unions. The bill 
gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Ad-
ministration (NCUA) authority to guarantee 
that noninterest-bearing customer accounts, 
along with the debt owned by depository insti-
tutions is covered even beyond the current 
$250,000 limit. 
Fortunately, there are a few limited deregu-
latory proposals included in the bill. Deregula-
tion is not the answer to this crisis. Congress 
will be overseeing the financial regulators in 
the weeks and months to come to ensure that 
they do not advance harmful rollbacks that will 
harm consumers during this time of national 
crisis. Financial regulators should focus all of 
their energy on the current crisis. They should 
immediately suspend any rulemaking or other 
efforts that have nothing to do with this crisis. 
The $500 billion Congress is authorizing for 
the Treasury Department and the Federal Re-
serve to prudently extend emergency assist-
ance directly and indirectly to corporations, 
non-profits, states, territories, and municipali-
ties in this turbulent moment for our economy 
must be used to protect workers, families, and 
the national economy. These funds should not 
be used to line the pockets of corporate ex-
ecutives or arrange for a taxpayer-funded 
slush fund that enriches President Trump or 
his family. 
That is why this bill expressly prohibits the 
President, members of the President’s Cabi-
net, and Members of Congress and their fami-
lies from receiving any of these funds. The bill 
also expressly limits executive compensation 
and bonuses for corporations receiving assist-
ance, and requires certain businesses receiv-
ing aid to uphold their collective bargaining 
agreements, maintain their workforce to at 
least 90 percent of what it was before the pan-
demic, and preserve worker pay and benefits. 
Furthermore, the bill prohibits companies re-
ceiving federal aid from engaging in stock 
buybacks and issuing dividends until tax-
payers are fully paid back. 
However, the bill allows the Treasury Sec-
retary to waive some of these conditions if the 
Secretary deems it in the federal government’s 
interests. This waiver is overly broad and thus 
should only be used in only the most excep-
tional cases. The bill requires the Secretary to 
make himself available to testify before the 
House Financial Services Committee if he de-
cides to exercise this waiver authority. Compa-
nies should not ask for waivers simply be-
cause they are available. It is the expectation 
of Congress that every business receiving 
government assistance fully complies with all 
of the aforementioned conditions. There is no 
reason that a business receiving taxpayer aid 
should focus on anything other than sup-
porting and retaining its workforce. Further-
more, a business receiving taxpayer funds 
should not be engaging in stock buybacks or 
issuing dividends, and its CEO should go be-
yond the bill’s conditions and restrain exces-
sive compensation practices. 
Furthermore, the final bill includes a number 
of oversight and transparency measures to en-
sure the program is administered fairly and 
that the use of these emergency funds truly 
helps workers and all communities. Specifi-
cally, the bill requires public reporting of trans-
actions in plain language on Treasury’s 
website within 72 hours. The bill also requires 
weekly and monthly reports by Treasury to 
Congress summarizing new transactions and 
outstanding obligations. The Federal Reserve 
must, similar to reporting requirements for 
emergency 
lending 
mandated 
in 
the 
DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act, also submit weekly and month-
ly reports to Congress on any new facility they 
stand up as well as outstanding loans or finan-
cial assistance provided by the Fed. The Sec-
retary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System will be required to testify before the 
House Financial Services Committee every 
single quarter regarding how the Treasury De-
partment and the Federal Reserve System are 
implementing the law. 
Moreover, the bill creates a Special Inspec-
tor General for Pandemic Recovery to combat 
waste, fraud and abuse and scrutinize every 
dollar spent in the administration of this $500 
billion Treasury program. Therefore, the Sec-
retary must prioritize the establishment of this 
Inspector General and have it open its doors 
as soon as possible. The Senate should con-
firm a qualified nominee for Inspector General 
quickly. Because the bill does not use an ex-
isting Inspector General, such as the Special 
Inspector General for TARP in H.R. 6379, 
there will be little executive branch oversight 
of these funds until the IG is up and running. 
Lastly, the bill creates a Congressional 
Oversight Commission, authorized to hold 
hearings, gather evidence, and publish month-
ly reports until 2025. The bill also authorizes 
the Government Accountability Office to pro-
vide an annual oversight report to Congress. 
Additionally, the bill creates a Pandemic Re-
sponse Accountability Committee within the 
Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity 
and Efficiency to ensure government-wide 
oversight through a number of Inspectors 
General to scrutinize the use of all Federal 
funds intended to address the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Since taxpayers are footing the bill, all 
Americans deserve to examine any and all in-
formation related to the administration, dis-
bursement and utilization of these funds. 
Therefore, I fully expect Treasury and the Fed-
eral Reserve to comply with the bill’s trans-
parency requirements and fully cooperate with 
these oversight entities, as well as the over-
sight conducted by Congress, including the 
Committee on Financial Services. Further-
more, I expect the oversight authorities estab-
lished by the bill to immediately make Con-
gress aware of any potential misuse of funds, 
conflicts of interest, or criminal or civil viola-
tions and refer any such matters, as appro-
priate, to the Department of Justice. 
I am pleased that this legislation includes 
important provisions that Democrats fought for 
to support individuals, families, workers, small 
business and communities, and support the 
bill’s passage. But, the legislation is far from 
sufficient to fully support our nation through 
this crisis. And so, I will be voting ‘‘yes’’ on the 
bill, and urge my colleagues to immediately 
begin working on additional legislation to help 
American families to endure and overcome 
this pandemic. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, while this bill 
is not perfect—few bills are—the bill before us 
today is a good bill and we are quite frankly 
in the midst of perhaps our greatest health 
care crisis since the flu pandemic of 1918, the 
year my grandmother was born in rural Ala-
bama. Because of the crisis, we have a re-
sponsibility to take action. 
Our President, Donald Trump, has shaped 
one of the most successful economic periods 
in our memory. I admire and support his ongo-
ing vision of creating and maintaining jobs in 
the United States. 
Unfortunately, this virus which we are cur-
rently dealing with has a very high rate of 
transmission, often before the carrier is symp-
tomatic. This is why the President and our 
healthcare experts have encouraged people to 
stay home, meaning that the very activities

crucial to thriving business activity have tem-
porarily been put on hold in order to stop the 
spread of the virus. 
Experts in both the public and private sec-
tors are working almost around the clock to 
produce the therapies and medical devices we 
need, and also on an eventual vaccine. 
In the meantime, we must help American 
workers and businesses who, through no fault 
of their own, simply cannot work due to cir-
cumstances and in some cases due to having 
the virus itself. 
This bill has been in the spotlight at every 
point in its negotiations. Again, while this bill is 
not perfect, it accomplishes a number of 
things I support. Here are just a few. 
Rural hospitals serve our constituents who 
cannot travel to large hospitals, and, indeed, 
are being asked not to travel at all. The $100 
billion emergency fund is necessary to prevent 
the imminent shutdowns of these small rural 
hospitals such as in my hometown of 
Haleyville which were already operating on a 
razor’s edge margin. This bill also includes as-
sistance for our Rural Health Clinics and Fed-
erally Qualified Health Centers to provide tele-
health services during this crisis. 
Likewise, we need for every person, every 
student, to have access to broadband internet 
service. 
During the course of negotiations on this 
bill, I repeatedly warned that rural Americans 
without access to high-speed internet are 
being left behind as Americans are asked to 
work from home, take classes online, and uti-
lize telehealth services to combat the spread 
of the coronavirus. After working alongside 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and also 
our Ranking Member of the Appropriations 
Committee KAY GRANGER of Texas, I am 
pleased to see that this bill contains $340 mil-
lion for rural broadband deployment, distance 
learning, and telehealth for rural areas. This is 
a step in the right direction toward getting rural 
Americans the help that they need during the 
coronavirus emergency. 
I applaud the President for his desire to 
send each family a check to help them in this 
time of need. Likewise, when they spend that 
money, that act will help sustain our economy. 
I believe that we will get through this crisis. 
And when we do, it will be the economy, the 
workers and families of this great nation who 
provide the lasting economic recovery we all 
look forward to. 
In the meantime, this bill has provisions to 
preserve our travel industry, our contractors 
working on the Artemis mission to take the 
first woman astronaut to the Moon, as well as 
scientists who monitor dangerous weather at 
NOAA. I want to thank the tremendous leader-
ship of Ranking Member GRANGER on those 
efforts, as well as our House leadership, espe-
cially my friend and colleague Minority Whip 
SCALISE, and Senator WICKER, as well as Rep-
resentatives POSEY, PALAZZO, and many oth-
ers on both sides of the aisle as we move for-
ward. 
I understand the concerns of many Mem-
bers and Senators about how the unemploy-
ment provisions work, but I believe that when 
this crisis passes, our economy will come 
roaring back. I want to continue to work with 
my colleagues on possible corrections and 
possibly another bill this spring. 
I want to thank our farmers, food proc-
essors, and truckers who continue during 
these difficult times to provide the most basic 
need: food. 
Also, our hospitals and healthcare work-
ers—the doctors, nurses, NPs, PAs, CRNAs, 
lab workers, technicians, and all the other staff 
who make our hospitals work—around the 
country are on the front lines of fighting this 
virus and we are so grateful for their sacrifice 
to take care of our citizens. 
Again, I sincerely believe that we will get 
through this crisis. Our country is stronger 
than this virus. This bill is just one example of 
how we can come together to find solutions. 
My prayers are with our families and all 
families across America as well as with all of 
our nation’s officials, from local government to 
the White House. I appreciate the feedback 
from everyone back home, and I hope to con-
tinue to do what I can to work on their behalf 
of all of those I represent. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, with state rev-
enues collapsing at the same time demand for 
services is skyrocketing, we have had broad 
agreement that something needs to be done 
to help the states. Although some might have 
preferred to increase the federal matching rate 
for Medicaid, this legislation goes a different 
route with a fiscal relief fund for state and 
local governments. 
In any case, the key is to help states plug 
the enormous fiscal gaps they are currently 
facing. I am pleased that the final legislative 
language, unlike some earlier proposals that 
we rejected, gives states broad flexibility in 
how they spend the money they will receive. 
At this point, it has become impossible to sep-
arate the effects on state budgets of rising de-
mands for services and shortfalls in revenues. 
States cannot spend the money on new 
projects unrelated to the public health emer-
gency and its economic fallout. I doubt any 
state would have done that anyway, but the 
legislation clearly says that they cannot. 
Beyond that, we trust states’ discretion 
about what expenditures are necessary in light 
of the current crisis. We also know that states 
planned many expenditures assuming reve-
nues that they are no longer receiving. An ac-
tivity without the revenue to support it is not 
accounted for in the state’s budget. 
States should understand that they can 
apply this money to prevent the cuts that 
would devastate their necessary functions that 
they can no longer cover from their general 
funds because of the loss of sales and income 
tax revenues. We are assured that the Treas-
ury Department appreciates the importance of 
getting this money out to states quickly, flexi-
bly and with a bare minimum of paperwork. 
I include in the RECORD the following Wash-
ington Post article, ‘‘States and Cities Should 
Brace Themselves for a Downward Spiral,’’ 
written by Catherine Rampell and published 
yesterday, March 26, 2020. 
States are facing huge shortages—and not 
just of ventilators, masks and health-care 
personnel. They’re about to confront enor-
mous budget shortages, too. This is the 
sleeper issue of the current economic crisis, 
and aiding states now could well be the dif-
ference between a brief recession and a pro-
longed depression. 
Particularly in ailing regions of the United 
States that still haven’t recovered from the 
last recession. 
The bill the Senate passed Wednesday 
would give state and local governments $150 
billion to help plug budget holes. It also in-
cludes $31 billion for local schools and col-
leges. That money is definitely welcome. 
But it will be nowhere near sufficient to 
prevent cascading state and local govern-
ment layoffs and cuts to critical public serv-
ices that otherwise lie ahead. For context: 
States suffered a cumulative $600 billion rev-
enue shortfall in the first five years after the 
Great Recession hit. 
And there are ample reasons to believe the 
fiscal crunch could be worse this time 
around. Many states entered this dual public 
health and economic emergency in poor 
budgetary shape, with too little in their 
‘‘rainy day’’ funds to handle this Noah-style 
deluge. As of late last year, only about half 
the states had the funds they need to weath-
er even a moderate recession, according to 
Moody’s Analytics. 
Seemingly every state will take a huge hit, 
for different reasons. Those whose economies 
are especially dependent on tourism (Flor-
ida, Nevada), energy (Texas, Oklahoma) and 
other hard-hit sectors are in trouble. As are 
those dependent on capital gains revenue 
(New York, California), given stock market 
declines. High-fixed-cost public transit sys-
tems everywhere will suffer as they lose 
rider revenue. And so on. 
Among the biggest problems are the ex-
pected declines in sales tax collections, 
which make up about a third of state rev-
enue. With millions of retail stores, res-
taurants and other businesses shuttered, 
sales on which those taxes are based have 
stopped. Even the early-pandemic panic-buy-
ing is unlikely to help, because groceries, 
medications and other necessities are often 
exempt from sales taxes. 
Taking a cue from the feds, many states 
have delayed their deadlines for filing 2019 
income taxes, too, meaning they will not be 
able to count on an April bump. 
Tax money that would normally be with-
held from people’s paychecks this year will 
also be depressed while people are out of 
work, suggesting revenue shortfalls will con-
tinue for a while. 
Depending on how long layoffs last, they 
could eventually start to depress property 
values, too—and thus the property taxes that 
disproportionately pay for schools and local 
services. Which suggests there could be re-
verberating fiscal effects for years after this 
pandemic ends. 
That’s just one side of the ledger. Mean-
while, states’ expenses are spiking, too. 
This always happens during recessions, as 
people seek a safety net when their income 
falls. But the particular cause of this reces-
sion—a 
public 
health 
emergency—means 
there will be even more demand for public 
services than usual. 
Already, unemployment insurance claims 
are off the charts, with initial claims filed 
last week reaching an all-time high of 3.3 
million. (The past record was 695,000, in 1982.) 
That figure probably understates the sever-
ity of the need, because government unem-
ployment websites have crashed. 
The 
aid 
package 
passed 
the 
Senate 
Wednesday would top off what states will 
offer workers seeking unemployment bene-
fits, and extend benefits to new categories of 
workers, but states will still be on the hook 
for huge obligations. 
Medicaid enrollment also usually rises dur-
ing a downturn, as jobless people lose their 
private insurance and reduced earnings make 
people newly eligible for benefits. But given 
that this downturn was caused by a pan-
demic, we should expect that more people 
than usual will seek public insurance, and 
that the spending per enrollee will be higher 
than normal. 
In its ‘‘phase two’’ bill, Congress tempo-
rarily increased the share of Medicaid costs 
borne by the federal government—but not by 
nearly as much as is needed, and not even by 
as much as it did in response to the Great 
Recession. Which is a shame, given that 
Medicaid is such a useful vehicle for distrib-
uting federal funds to states even when there 
isn’t a public health emergency.

March 27, 2020 
The fastest, most efficient way to get 
money out to the states is through Medicaid, 
because there’s a whole mechanism already 
that allows for that all in place,’’ said Scott 
Pattison, former executive director of both 
the National Governors Association and the 
National Association of State Budget Offi-
cers. 
Unlike the federal government, most state 
and local governments are legally required 
to balance their budgets. Without more fed-
eral help, states and cities shouldn’t expect a 
swift snapback from this crisis. Instead, they 
should brace for a downward spiral—of serv-
ice cuts, deteriorating conditions for house-
holds and businesses, and depressed eco-
nomic conditions for years to come. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Mr. Speaker, my home is again an epicenter 
for a national disaster. Today, New York City 
is the frontline of the war against the spread 
of coronavirus; the United States now has the 
most confirmed COVID–19 cases in the world, 
and New York City has, by far, the most cases 
in the United States, reaching more than 
23,000 as of this morning. New Yorkers are 
facing this crisis with strength and optimism 
and we, as we have so often, are providing a 
model for the other cities and states that will 
confront similar challenges in the days and 
weeks to come. 
My constituents always come first. If I 
thought that I could help them at this time by 
breaking every bit of expert medical guidance 
on containing the coronavirus, then I would 
travel to the Capitol in a heartbeat. But with 
the outcome assured, I can best serve my 
constituents and New York by following best 
practices and staying here, facing down this 
crisis with the strength for which New Yorkers 
are justly known. 
Had I been present, I would have voted to 
pass this emergency relief legislation to get 
immediate help to our hospitals, small busi-
nesses, and individual Americans. Let me be 
clear: this is disaster relief to address the im-
mediate crisis in front of us; there is much 
more that needs to be done to help restart the 
economy, and we will be turning our efforts to 
that as soon as this $2 trillion relief package 
is signed into law. 
This bill is not perfect, but it is essential that 
we act now. With this bill, more than $40 bil-
lion will flow to New York—not just for the 
state and city but directly to our hospitals and 
healthcare workers and small businesses, par-
ticularly for employee retention. There will also 
be direct payments to individuals and signifi-
cantly more resources for those who have lost 
their job because of this crisis. 
This bill includes important wins for progres-
sive policy proposals that Democrats fought 
for, including: a large investment in hospitals, 
our health system, and state and local govern-
ments to give them the resources they need 
during this emergency; a massive increase in 
unemployment insurance benefits so that 
these benefits match the average paycheck of 
laid-off and furloughed workers; a significant 
expansion of fast relief for small businesses, 
including making rent, mortgages, and utility 
costs eligible for Small Business Administra-
tion (SBA) loan forgiveness; billions of dollars 
for emergency education funding and the 
elimination of income tax on student loan re-
payment assistance by an employer; and ac-
countability and oversight by preventing secret 
bailouts and adding special oversight require-
ments. 
Importantly for New Yorkers, this expansion 
of unemployment insurance covers all work-
ers, whether they work for small or larger busi-
ness, are self-employed, or work in the gig 
economy. Of the $260 billion dedicated for this 
proposal, $15 billion is projected to come 
home to New York. Additionally, a relief fund 
for state and local governments is projected to 
send at least $5.8 billion to New York State 
and more than $1.4 billion to New York City. 
This legislation puts workers first by banning 
stock buybacks and limiting executive com-
pensation for the duration that a company is 
receiving government assistance plus one 
year for any company that receives a govern-
ment loan from this bill. It also establishes ro-
bust worker protections attached to most fed-
eral loans for businesses. There will be real- 
time public reporting of any transactions by 
the Treasury Department under this bill, in-
cluding terms of loans, investments, and other 
assistance to corporations. Democrats also 
added a retention tax credit for employers to 
encourage all businesses to keep workers on 
the payroll during this crisis and removed the 
‘‘secret bailout’’ provision of the initial Repub-
lican proposal that would have allowed bail-
outs to be concealed for 6 months. 
As Chair of the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform, I am proud that the committee will be 
at the forefront of fulfilling Congress’ vitally im-
portant Constitutional responsibility to conduct 
oversight of the distribution of funds to cor-
porations under this legislation. 
The bill includes important provisions to en-
sure that taxpayer dollars are used effectively 
and efficiently, including dedicated funding and 
enhanced authorities for Inspectors General 
and the independent Government Account-
ability Office to fight waste, fraud, and abuse 
in the government spending that will happen 
under this bill. 
The bill includes several provisions that I, 
along with my counterpart in the Senate, Sen-
ator GARY PETERS, offered. Among the provi-
sions we are adopting today are, as follows: 
Pandemic Response Accountability Com-
mittee: The Pandemic Response Account-
ability Committee will be made up of inde-
pendent Inspectors General who will conduct 
and coordinate audits and investigations to 
provide accountability and identify waste, 
fraud, and abuse in spending under the Act 
and the response to the coronavirus crisis. 
This provision will help ensure that Inspectors 
General have the authorities and funding nec-
essary to conduct oversight, including access 
to documents and testimony from government 
officials and private sector entities. The bill re-
quires extensive public reporting through 
Oversight.gov on what the Inspectors General 
find during their oversight, and it requires 
agencies to report information about spending 
under the bill. 
$20 Million for Government Accountability 
Office: The bill allocates $20 million to enable 
the independent Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) to help Congress conduct over-
sight of the spending under this bill and other 
efforts to respond to the crisis. The bill pro-
vides GAO with the ability to conduct oversight 
and inspections of private entities receiving 
funding under the bill to protect against fraud. 
The bill also includes several other oversight 
initiatives including: 
Special Inspector General for Pandemic Re-
covery: The bill establishes a Special Inspec-
tor General to conduct oversight over stimulus 
spending by the Department of the Treasury. 
The bill requires the Special Inspector General 
to track all loans, loan guarantees, and other 
obligations and expenditures made by the 
Treasury Department under the bill. The bill 
provides $25 million for the Special Inspector 
General and authorizes the position for five 
years. 
Congressional Oversight Commission: The 
bill includes the establishment of a Congres-
sional Oversight Commission to oversee stim-
ulus spending by the Department of Treasury 
and the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve. The Commission will be tasked with 
evaluating issues such as the impact of loans, 
loan guarantees, and investments made under 
the bill on the United States people, economy, 
financial markets, and financial institutions. 
The Commission will be required to submit re-
ports to Congress every 30 days. 
Finally, the bill includes mechanisms to pre-
vent the airline industry from using taxpayer 
funds for purposes Congress never intended, 
as the industry did after 9/11. 
To prevent a repeat of these abuses, the 
House and Senate worked together to estab-
lish clear requirements for expectations and 
accountability, including: 
Required Assurances from Air Carriers: The 
bill requires air carriers to agree to certain 
conditions in order to accept loans or loan 
guarantees from the Secretary of the Treas-
ury. These conditions impose limitations on 
the ability of air carriers to buy back stocks, 
pay dividends to shareholders, layoff or fur-
lough employees, and increase executive pay. 
In closing, I want to offer my deepest appre-
ciation to the Democratic negotiating team, led 
by our peerless Speaker and Minority Leader 
SCHUMER, which so dramatically improved the 
legislation from the original bill that Senate 
Republicans 
initially 
tried 
to 
pass. 
The 
achievement of this legislation is not the 
speed with which it was assembled, but the 
breadth of its vision to focus on direct assist-
ance to individuals and conditioning so much 
of the aid to companies on keeping our friends 
and neighbors employed. Getting through this 
moment in history will be eased for many be-
cause of the hard-won provisions of this legis-
lation achieved by the Democrats. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, our nation is 
facing an unprecedented pandemic, and I am 
proud that Congress has come together again 
to provide desperately needed resources and 
relief to the American people. 
The ‘‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Security (CARES) Act’’ is the third emergency 
relief bill to provide assistance to millions of 
Americans, especially for our healthcare work-
ers, first responders, small businesses, and in-
dividuals who are unable to work because of 
this outbreak. 
Eighty percent of the $340 billion in emer-
gency funding included in the bill goes directly 
to state and local governments, supporting 
their frontline efforts to respond to the virus. 
More than $125 billion will be used to support 
our hospitals and purchase medical supplies 
likes gloves, face masks, and gowns and 
equipment like ventilators and respirators that 
our healthcare heroes desperately need. 
The bill also provides small businesses with 
the capital to sustain operations and payroll, 
preserving the jobs of millions and ensuring 
that those job creators can reopen imme-
diately once the virus passes. 
Our around-the-clock efforts to negotiate 
this bill paid off—we’ve reached a historic bi-
partisan, bicameral agreement. While there

are some things in this bill that I wish were ad-
dressed differently, the bill will do what is in-
tended: support the American people, lessen 
the impact of the virus, and jumpstart our 
economy. 
As many of you know, Tarrant Country has 
a ‘‘stay-at-home’’ order currently in effect, and 
due to that order and travel concerns, I dis-
appointingly will not be in D.C. to cast my vote 
in person today. Nevertheless, relief is on its 
way to the American people. 
As we continue to fight this invisible enemy, 
it is vitally important that we remain in it to-
gether, follow the recommendations of the 
President, his task force, and our state and 
local leaders, and support those that need as-
sistance during this time. The health and safe-
ty of our community relies on our partnership. 
As the situation progresses, I will continue 
to work with President Trump, Governor Ab-
bott, and local leaders to keep our friends and 
family safe and ensure we win against this 
pandemic. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I deeply 
regret that I was unable to be present at to-
day’s vote, and so submit this statement in 
order to officially express my support for the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act. Had I not been under physi-
cian orders to self-quarantine, after coming 
into contact with an individual who tested posi-
tive for COVID–19, I would have proudly cast 
my vote in favor of this legislation. From the 
very start of this unprecedented public health 
and economic emergency, my number-one pri-
ority has been to put relief for our nation’s 
workers, families, and seniors first. After in-
tense negotiation, this historic $2 trillion stim-
ulus now takes a monumental step in that di-
rection. 
As the coronavirus continues to gain a foot-
hold in the United States, workers face in-
creasing uncertainty. Last week, the number 
of unemployment claims filed reached a 
record high, and those numbers are expected 
to only grow. The legislation that the House 
passed today offers much needed stability and 
peace of mind for American workers, by dra-
matically expanding our unemployment insur-
ance program. As a result, jobless workers will 
see an increase of $600 per week in their un-
employment benefits for a period of four 
months, as well as an extension of regular un-
employment benefits by 13 weeks. Moreover, 
for the first time in history, independent con-
tractors, gig workers, and self-employed indi-
viduals will be universally eligible to collect un-
employment benefits. 
As with our public health response, Con-
gress recognizes the centrality of prevention to 
our nation’s economic response. Blunting the 
impact of this pandemic and necessary social 
distancing on workers will require not only that 
we strengthen the social safety net, but that 
we also provide robust assistance to Amer-
ica’s economic backbone: small businesses. 
Over the past week, Democrats have fiercely 
negotiated for enhanced relief for small busi-
nesses, and in the end we were able to se-
cure $377 billion in funding. These loans and 
grants will help small businesses continue to 
make payroll and rent payments, and ulti-
mately, keep workers employed. 
From day one, we’ve understood that lim-
iting economic fallout from coronavirus re-
quires a multi-pronged approach. The direct 
payments, under this bill, will quickly inject 
cash into the pockets of American workers, 
families, and seniors, so that they can con-
tinue to make ends meet. While I would have 
liked to have seen even more generous pay-
ments go to our low- and middle-income 
Americans, I am nevertheless pleased with 
this start. 
Finally, I am extremely grateful that Demo-
crats and Republicans were able to come to-
gether to direct more than $150 billion to our 
hospitals and health care system. Anything 
less would have been shortsighted, and would 
have 
represented 
a 
grave 
failing 
on 
Congress’s part. Now, hospitals will have the 
resources needed to increase surge capacity. 
In addition, these funds will go towards sup-
porting COVID–19 medical research and pro-
viding frontline health care workers with per-
sonal protective equipment, ventilators, and 
other critically-needed medical supplies. If we 
hope to slow the spread of this virus, save 
American lives—including those of our heroic 
frontline health care workers—and help re-
store normalcy to our lives and economy, we 
must equip our health care system with the re-
sources it needs to operate effectively. Over 
the coming months, it will be imperative that 
Congress continues to invest in the health 
care infrastructure. 
Like any compromise, this bill is far from 
perfect. Still, the investments that the House 
has made today will go a long way toward de-
livering swift, meaningful relief to Americans, 
during this challenging time. Going forward, I 
will continue to push for further investment in 
our hard-hit communities. I am under no mis-
conceptions that our work combating this pan-
demic is done. In the meantime, particularly in 
this era of sharp partisan division, I hope to-
day’s uniquely bipartisan effort will serve as a 
comforting reminder to the American people of 
their government’s ability to come together in 
times of crisis to put them first. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, as individuals, 
families, and communities across this country 
and the world deal with the COVID–19 pan-
demic, I know residents in the 13th Congres-
sional District are looking for immediate, last-
ing relief. I know that our medical workers and 
first responders are looking for resources and 
enough personal protection equipment to be 
able to do their jobs caring for the sick. Our 
hospitals are overloaded and need immediate 
support to provide enough beds and facilities 
to care for our communities. It’s for our resi-
dents, frontline medical workers, and hospitals 
who desperately need help today that I sup-
port the passage of the CARES Act—but this 
is only the beginning of our fight for relief that 
goes to the people first. 
This bill does not go far enough. However, 
residents are in dire need of direct payments 
to help replace the loss of income they’ve ex-
perienced. We know residents who are now 
unemployed can’t wait for an increase in un-
employment insurance amounts. Small busi-
nesses and non-profits will now have access 
to loans that may be forgiven. Hospitals, 
health care facilities, and medical providers 
will receive $100 billion dollars to protect com-
munities across the country. And the state of 
Michigan will receive nearly $3.9 billion in 
funding to help stop this pandemic, including 
$351 million for public transit systems and 
nearly $74 million for housing (HUD) emer-
gency solution grants. 
We have already begun the work of pushing 
for a fourth COVID–19 response package that 
includes critical provisions I’ve been fighting 
for in Washington. 
Our local governments, municipalities, and 
states have been at the forefront of respond-
ing to this crisis. They have sprung into action 
and must have the resources they need to 
save lives, and are now being forced to go 
without crucial revenues and divert funds to 
COVID–19 relief. I have continuously advo-
cated that we do more to prevent the financial 
collapse of state and local governments 
through the Federal Reserve’s toolbox. This 
bill provides some mechanisms for the Fed to 
provide financial relief to our cities and states, 
but we need stronger requirements for the Fed 
to purchase debt and support our local gov-
ernments. 
A one-time payment is not enough to pro-
vide relief to the thousands of our residents 
who have been laid off or will lose income for 
the foreseeable future. Our residents need 
monthly payments, like I have proposed, to 
continue until after the economic shocks 
caused by this pandemic end. 
We need to immediately implement a water 
shutoff prohibition, which 80 members of the 
House supported in a letter I led with Reps. 
DINGELL and KILDEE to House leadership. It is 
imperative that we ensure households have 
clean, safe water running from the faucets, es-
pecially during a time where hand washing is 
essential in preventing the spread of COVID– 
19. 
These critical provisions should have been 
prioritized over giving corporations a half-tril-
lion dollar handout, which I am concerned that 
the CARES Act does. Congress must begin 
working immediately to develop and pass a 
fourth stimulus bill, one that delivers on these 
provisions and more for the people who will 
suffer most during this crisis. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the coronavirus economic recovery 
package being considered today. 
Never in our lifetimes have we experienced 
a public health crisis such as the one we are 
experiencing right now. 
From the employees who are losing their 
jobs, to the small business owners who are 
being forced to shut down, every facet of our 
society has been impacted by this pandemic. 
With millions of American families struggling 
to make ends meet, Congress must take im-
mediate action to bring them relief. The legis-
lation before us today puts us on the path to 
do just that. 
Most importantly, this package puts workers 
and their families first. 
The bill would provide direct payments to 
most American workers to help them get by 
while much of our economy is shut down. This 
extra money is critical to many of my constitu-
ents that have had hours slashed or income 
lost as result of this crisis. 
The bill also dramatically expands unem-
ployment insurance, including for workers with 
non-traditional employment. This is vitally im-
portant for many of my constituents who work 
in the gig-economy or are self-employed. 
Under this package, these workers, along 
with those that work for traditional businesses, 
would be eligible for unemployment insurance 
that would, on average, ensure they receive 
their full pay for four months. 
And for those that were already on the edge 
of housing insecurity, this bill would provide 
billions of dollars in support for affordable 
housing and homelessness assistance pro-
grams. 
The bill also provides essential support to 
the small businesses that fuel our local econo-
mies and contribute to our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1855 
March 27, 2020 
If we don’t take bold action right now, many 
of these businesses may not survive. We can-
not let that happen. 
This package includes billions of dollars in 
much-needed assistance for small businesses, 
that will incentivize them to maintain payroll 
and avoid laying off workers. And it will help 
these small businesses afford rent or mort-
gages as they work tirelessly to navigate this 
crisis. 
Our students are also hurting from this cri-
sis. This bill would provide billions in emer-
gency education funding and eliminate income 
tax on a large chunk of student loan repay-
ment assistance paid for by an employer. 
Finally, this package would direct billions of 
dollars toward hospitals and other health care 
providers on the frontlines of this pandemic. It 
will continue our efforts to provide our health 
care workers with the life-saving protective 
equipment they need to do their jobs safely 
and effectively. 
It is no question that this relief package 
would provide critical assistance to American 
workers and their families. But it’s also no 
question that there’s more work to be done. 
We still must do more to protect our immi-
grant communities, incarcerated individuals, 
undocumented people, and many more. 
We also must do more to protect reproduc-
tive rights. The inclusion of Hyde restrictions 
on yet another federal funding stream is abso-
lutely unacceptable and should never have 
been allowed. 
Exploiting the urgent need to pass this 
emergency funding bill by adding unnecessary 
abortion coverage restrictions only further 
harms the health of our communities and 
shows just how far the Administration and 
anti-abortion politicians will go to push their 
agenda. 
Furthermore, I am strongly disappointed that 
the Small Business Administration has been 
given broad discretion to exclude critical busi-
nesses, such as Planned Parenthood and 
YMCA, from participating in the new small 
business loan program. 
This move will only take away imperative re-
sources, particularly essential health services, 
that our communities need to respond to this 
public health crisis. 
Despite these concerns, I urge my col-
leagues to come together and pass this critical 
package to bring immediate relief to our fami-
lies, workers, and small businesses. 
But tomorrow, we must continue our work 
on the next major piece of legislation to pro-
tect the health and well-being of all. 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the 
Coronavirus continues to sweep across our 
nation, there is nothing more important to me 
than the health and safety of the American 
people. I strongly support rapid passage of the 
CARES Act to accelerate much-needed re-
sources to our nation’s health care profes-
sionals and provide critical aide to Americans, 
small businesses, and families. 
As Ranking Member of the MilCon/VA Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, I am proud to 
have worked on securing $19.6 billion for vet-
erans’ programs to help combat COVID–19. 
I’m honored to represent the largest popu-
lation of veterans in Texas and am committed 
to ensuring Congress continues providing top- 
level care to the brave men and women who 
have sacrificed to keep our nation and free, 
many of whom are at-risk of serious complica-
tions should they contract COVID–19. 
In this challenging time, it is critical that 
Congress continue working in a bipartisan 
manner to provide aid, relief, and economic 
security to the nation. Continuing to work 
across the aisle to provide our country the re-
sources it needs is the only way forward. 
I am grateful to the incredible health care 
professionals, first responders and essential 
service employees who are working tirelessly 
to keep our nation healthy. I also salute Amer-
icans who are following guidelines and doing 
their part to flatten the curve for not only their 
own health but for their neighbors. 
Together, we will get through this. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 748, the CARES Act. 
This bill is far from perfect, nor do I think this 
bill contains all that I think is important at this 
time. We will continue to work. 
However, this landmark piece of legislation 
will take a step in providing economic relief for 
the thousands of Texans in my district that are 
either at home or on the front lines as essen-
tial workers, as we fight to bend the curve of 
this pandemic that is sweeping across our 
country. Again, this is the best we can do at 
this time, but we will continue to work to en-
sure the needs of the American people are 
met. 
This bipartisan bill that we are debating here 
today provides economic protection to Ameri-
cans during this crisis by providing expanded 
unemployment benefits for those that have 
been laid off, direct cash assistance to our 
constituents so that they can use this relief to 
continue meeting their everyday expenses, 
and much needed funding to our Small Busi-
nesses so that they can meet payroll and 
overhead costs. 
Furthermore, this bill provides critically 
needed funding and resources to our hos-
pitals, community health centers, and local 
and state governments. We must ensure that 
when our communities are faced with this pub-
lic health emergency, our systems can provide 
the urgent medical attention they need. We 
have also successfully agreed to the require-
ment for health insurance companies to pay 
for coronavirus testing, thus eliminating a sig-
nificant barrier to ensuring that each and every 
person that needs to be tested can access 
testing. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a public health crisis 
that has vast economic consequences. Our 
job in congress should be to ensure the safety 
and prosperity of our constituents as we fight 
this pandemic, This bill takes a step in doing 
exactly that. It will not be the only step we 
take in addressing both the public health and 
economic issues that this we will face through-
out this fight, but it is a step in the right direc-
tion. I urge my colleagues to come together 
and support this monumental legislation. 
Ms. 
UNDERWOOD. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act puts the health and well- 
being of families and workers first in order to 
provide support and relief to Americans suf-
fering from the health and economic impacts 
of the devastating COVID–19 pandemic. 
Throughout my time in Congress and espe-
cially now, I have consistently prioritized poli-
cies that save lives and support northern Illi-
nois families. The best way we can do this is 
to take immediate action to help our economy 
and support the everyday people who make it 
work. 
This has been a terribly hard time for our 
community. According to the Johns Hopkins 
University & Medicine Coronavirus Resource 
Center, today, there are 549,604 cases glob-
ally, and 85,996 cases in the United States. 
The Illinois Department of Public Health re-
ports 2,538 positive cases and 26 deaths in Il-
linois as of March 26, 2020. We have lost be-
loved community members across Illinois’s 
14th Congressional District. Countless others 
are in need of testing, and thousands of our 
frontline health care providers need personal 
protective equipment (PPE). And, all across 
our community, families are being thrown into 
economic distress—over 114,000 Illinoisans 
applied for unemployment last week alone. 
Many of us are coming together during 
these times. That extension of kindness and 
grace must extend to our neighbors of Asian 
descent who are facing an increased amount 
of discrimination and hate-filled acts. This type 
of division, along with the dissemination of 
false information about COVID–19, is dan-
gerous for public health and safety and cannot 
be tolerated. 
I have spent the last weeks talking with hun-
dreds of people all across our community. 
During some conversations I heard from par-
ents trying to balance working from home, 
educating their children, and caring for elderly 
loved ones. For some, it meant talking to 
small business owners trying to figure out how 
to make sure their family businesses and their 
employees come back from this. For other 
calls, it meant listening to folks who are 
scared that they will run out of money before 
they can work again and that they don’t know 
how to keep their family afloat. And I heard 
from the husband of a nurse who is terrified 
his wife is at risk because she is bravely going 
into work every day without sufficient protec-
tive equipment. 
Our community is struggling in all kinds of 
different ways. But we know that we will get 
through this unsettling and extremely chal-
lenging time together. One of the best tools 
we have to help right now is the CARES Act: 
a robust legislative package developed with bi-
partisan, bicameral cooperation at record 
speed over the last week in order to protect 
our community’s health—including health care 
providers on the front lines of this crisis—and 
our economy. 
Notably, this legislation contains updates to 
ensure that Americans will not have to pay out 
of pocket for COVID–19 testing, and it en-
sures Medicare will cover a COVID–19 vac-
cine as soon as our brilliant scientists get one 
to market. In the face of a pandemic, all Amer-
icans should have access to a reliable 
COVID–19 diagnostic test if they need one. 
Tests are not yet widely available in our north-
ern Illinois community, and our three public 
health labs in Illinois are working around the 
clock to deliver results for patients. We will 
keep working to expand testing capacity in our 
communities, a critical step towards disease 
surveillance. 
The incredible contribution of our most trust-
ed health providers, nurses, has been on full 
display throughout the coronavirus response. 
From student nurses surging to help care for 
sick patients in New York City to recently re-
tired nurses stepping up to serve our commu-
nity at home in Illinois, nurses continue to lead 
on the front lines of clinical research and prac-
tice. Importantly, the CARES Act invests in the 
heroic Americans who are giving everything 
right now to save lives: health care providers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1856 
March 27, 2020 
The CARES Act secures $100 billion to help 
hospitals, health systems, and community pro-
viders cover costs related to COVID–19. This 
will help Northwestern Medicine, the largest 
employer in my district, as well as community 
health centers like the Center for Family 
Health in Sycamore, which will see their fund-
ing boosted and extended. These clinics are 
lifelines in our community and I am proud to 
support their work. 
There is not a health care facility in Illinois 
right now that is not in need of additional per-
sonal protective equipment for the brave 
Americans serving our ill neighbors. All health 
providers, caregivers, essential personnel, and 
first responders should have complete sets of 
PPE that is required to do their jobs safely— 
they are mission critical and key to our recov-
ery from COVID–19. There have been wide-
spread shortages of PPE, certainly in our 
community, but also in many others across the 
country. This is unacceptable, and I hope the 
Administration’s new Supply Chain Stabiliza-
tion Task Force will quickly increase the avail-
ability of needed PPE, including by utilizing 
the full force of the Defense Production Act, 
which could make desperately needed testing 
supplies and PPE available in the commu-
nities that need them most. 
In the meantime, heroic members of my 
community, like Anna Haley Fielder of Antioch, 
are stepping up to fill the unmet need by orga-
nizing neighbors to sew face masks to help 
protect health providers and other essential 
workers. This should never have had to hap-
pen in the first place. That is why I support the 
CARES Act’s provision of $16 billion to replen-
ish COVID–19 supplies in the Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile. This builds on the $3.1 billion 
allocated for the Public Health and Social 
Services Emergency Fund, which supports the 
Strategic National Stockpile, in H.R. 6074, the 
Coronavirus Preparedness and Response 
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020. 
First responders have a critical need for 
PPE as well. Over the past week, many may-
ors have expressed their concern to me that 
firefighters and law enforcement officers with-
out the PPE needed to safely protect our com-
munity during this pandemic may fall victim to 
COVID–19, impairing their public safety mis-
sion. The CARES Act includes $100 million for 
the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, 
which can pay for PPE and other supplies our 
first responders need. 
Our health care workforce is being tested at 
greater levels than we have seen in recent 
decades, which is why the inclusion of the 
Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization 
Act of 2019 (H.R. 728) in the CARES Act is 
so critically important. I championed this bipar-
tisan legislation early in my congressional ten-
ure because I know that an investment in 
nursing education yields exponential return in 
our communities. 
One of the principles of effective prepared-
ness is ensuring a supply chain that can pro-
vide needed supplies during times of emer-
gencies and public health crises like a global 
pandemic. The CARES Act includes bipartisan 
legislation, the Commission on U.S. Medical 
Security Act (H.R. 6282), which I helped intro-
duce with Dr. RAUL RUIZ, Dr. PHIL ROE, and 
my Illinois colleague Senator DICK DURBIN. 
Our legislation will strengthen the security of 
the U.S. medical supply chain. 
Supporting seniors who are at high risk for 
infection is a priority in the CARES Act, which 
includes $200 million to help mitigate COVID– 
19 spread in nursing homes. I am pleased that 
many improvements to Medicare, funding to 
support our health system and family care-
givers, and critical support services like Meals 
on Wheels were also included in the legisla-
tion. These resources will be critical to prevent 
outbreaks and save lives. 
This month, Wall Street’s response to this 
crisis led to trading suspensions and record 
shifts in the stock market. Swift intervention to 
stabilize our economy, and embracing policies 
to support workers, families, and small busi-
nesses first allows us to invest in the critical 
economic engines that fuel northern Illinois. 
My legislative agenda has long centered on 
economic security and opportunity for the 
working families of the 14th district. This com-
mitment has been demonstrated through sup-
porting a broad approach to job creation and 
championing legislation that provides flexibility 
to entrepreneurs seeking to start a small busi-
ness. Small businesses are the foundation of 
our economy throughout the 14th Congres-
sional District, and the CARES Act recognizes 
their unique challenges. A new $350 billion 
Paycheck Protection Program will make zero- 
fee loans available to small businesses, with 
the ability to have up to eight weeks of payroll 
and other costs forgiven from the loan if a 
business retains employees and their salary 
levels—an important incentive to support 
workers. Another $10 billion in grants will sup-
port small businesses and nonprofits that have 
suffered economic injury in response to 
COVID–19, a provision that will make a dif-
ference for Illinois families. This is on top of 
the first wave of billions of dollars for small 
business disaster loans that are already being 
processed. 
Many families will receive direct financial as-
sistance from the U.S. Treasury, to stimulate 
consumer confidence and provide a needed 
boost to many families experiencing difficult 
and 
unanticipated 
related 
economic 
cir-
cumstances related to COVID–19. Individuals 
can receive a recovery rebate of up to $1,200 
each (up to $2,400 for a married couple) with 
an additional $500 per child. 
With an unexpected layoff or sharp de-
crease in earning potential, many families find 
themselves with limited income and difficulty 
affording rent, mortgage payments, and other 
housing-related obligations. As part of our ef-
forts to offer relief to workers and families, the 
CARES Act allows forbearance on federally- 
backed mortgages for family homes for up to 
12 months and sets a moratorium on fore-
closures and evictions in many properties re-
ceiving federal subsidies or assistance. 
Employers are also receiving needed finan-
cial support and flexibility for their workforces, 
including loans from the Small Business Ad-
ministration. I hope many employers take ad-
vantage of these new programs quickly in 
order to retain their skilled and loyal workers 
and facilitate a quicker economic recovery. 
The CARES Act also supports self-employed 
and gig economy workers through a temporary 
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Pro-
gram. This legislation also expands the unem-
ployment insurance available to those who 
have lost work through this crisis by $600 per 
week, and immediately extends the period for 
which coverage is available by 13 weeks. 
On March 26, 2020, we learned that 3.28 
million Americans filed for unemployment dur-
ing the previous week, more than four times 
higher than ever recorded. The Department of 
Labor reports that in reporting these numbers, 
‘‘states continued to cite services industries 
broadly, particularly accommodation and food 
services.’’ This is no surprise to Illinois work-
ers who have seen in-restaurant dining closed 
since March 16. 
The United States Postal Service has been 
a steady presence in our communities, offer-
ing essential mail and supply delivery services 
to even the most remote homes in our country 
with their six-day delivery schedule. The 
CARES Act includes some assistance for the 
Postal Service, and I will work to further sup-
port our postal system in future legislation. 
So many families across my community are 
experiencing hardship due to COVID–19. 
Whether helping families through sickness or 
loss of income, our local charities and non-
profits have quickly stepped up to serve our 
seven counties and I am pleased the CARES 
Act creates a $300 above-the-line deduction 
for charitable contributions from taypayers who 
take the standard deduction. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs is also 
responding to the COVID–19 crisis. The 
CARES Act offers $14.4 billion for testing kits, 
personal protective equipment, and medical 
supplies to support growing demand for health 
care services at the VA. The bill also allows 
for new agreements to temporarily expand 
telemental health for veterans in rural areas 
who may lack local providers who could offer 
those needed services. 
Governor Pritzker of Illinois ordered all 
schools closed by March 17, 2020, to slow the 
spread of COVID–19. In response to my con-
versations with superintendents, I prioritized 
securing resources to facilitate e-learning for 
our K–12 students. Many school districts in 
the 14th Congressional District also need 
funding flexibility due to disruption in the aca-
demic year from COVID–19, and I am pleased 
that the CARES Act begins to deliver. The bill 
includes $13.5 billion in grants to states for K– 
12 education, which can be used for the costs 
of responding to COVID–19, including for 
hardware to support e-learning. 
The legislation also supports college stu-
dents whose semesters were disrupted due to 
COVID–19. While the CARES Act falls short 
of offering the comprehensive relief from stu-
dent loans that is necessary in this grave eco-
nomic period, the bill offers much-needed tem-
porary relief. I will continue to work for more 
in future relief packages. 
On March 17, 2020, Illinois held primary 
elections, allowing residents to safely partici-
pate in our democracy. We must already start 
making plans to ensure the remaining states 
can complete their primary elections with the 
same emphasis on health and safety for the 
American people. The CARES Act makes a 
$400 million down payment towards protecting 
our democracy during this crisis through elec-
tion security grants to states, but more must 
be done. The Take Responsibility for Workers 
and Families Act provided $4 billion to secure 
our elections during this crisis, and would im-
plement needed reforms, like easier voter reg-
istration, 15–day early voting periods, and vote 
by mail expansions. These reforms have been 
implemented in Illinois, are popular and effec-
tive, and should be implemented in any up-
coming 
federal 
legislation 
responding 
to 
COVID–19.

other national security threats must remain a

priority in times of pandemics. We cannot let 
our preparedness posture suffer under the 
weight of a whole-of-government pandemic re-
sponse or distracted attention from ongoing 
Homeland Security initiatives. As a result, I am 
pleased the CARES Act reauthorizes the 
Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards 
program through July 2020 and provides $9 
million for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency to help secure our supply 
chains and critical infrastructure during this cri-
sis. 
This important legislation is not the end, our 
families will need more. We need to improve 
health care affordability, expand access to 
care, and offer protections from the surprise 
medical bills that could arise as a result of 
COVID–19 testing or treatment. We need a 
special open enrollment period to allow unin-
sured individuals to sign up for affordable 
health care. We will need to expand paid fam-
ily and medical leave and we will need in-
creased health care worker and pension pro-
tections. Our state and local governments will 
need more resources to support their leader-
ship on the ground. And we will likely need 
more in payments directly into the hands of 
Americans so they can continue to support 
their families and their local economies. I will 
fight for our community’s needs and work with 
my colleagues to get these priorities included 
in the next congressional relief package. 
The CARES Act puts the health and well- 
being of families and workers first, to allow us 
to recover from COVID–19 and rebuild the 
U.S. economy. I am so deeply grateful to the 
health care providers, first responders, grocery 
store clerks, and all the people on the front 
lines of this crisis. I am grateful to serve our 
country at this time of immense need to care 
for individuals, families and these United 
States of America. Together we will rise. Let’s 
take care of our neighbors. Wash our hands. 
And be well. I will see you again soon. 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, New Mexi-
cans, Americans, and people around the world 
are facing a crisis: the coronavirus pandemic 
is giving us an opportunity to question what 
we value most. 
How do we value the workers who grow and 
harvest our food, deliver it to our stores, and 
help put it on our tables? 
How do we value the people who put their 
lives on the line in hospitals and healthcare 
centers to keep our loved ones healthy? 
How do we value the people who educate 
and care for our children during the day so 
that they are ready for the future? 
Our lives and our way of life are threatened 
by this virus, and the only way we can battle 
that threat is to do it together. 
I’ve spoken with doctors, nurses, and first 
responders in Albuquerque who put their own 
lives at risk every day to help identify those 
who are infected and treat those who are sick, 
and they are running out of personal protec-
tive equipment and testing supplies. They are 
worried that hospitals don’t have the capacity 
to handle all the patients who will fall ill. 
Democrats fought to make sure that The 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity Act includes comprehensive support for 
health care workers. 
The bill provides $150 billion to help all 
types of hospitals and providers that are most 
affected by COVID–19 and will fund whatever 
is needed to fight this virus. 
It also creates a $150 billion Coronavirus 
Relief Fund to help state, local, and tribal gov-
ernments’ efforts to fight the pandemic. 
I’m pleased that a minimum of $1.25 billion 
of this funding is allocated for New Mexico, 
and I fought to make sure that $8 billion will 
go to Indian tribes across the country. 
In addition, the bill includes over $30 billion 
for states, school districts, and institutions of 
higher education to address coronavirus costs. 
We all have an important role to play in the 
battle against the coronavirus, too. 
Humans are responsible for the spread, but 
that also means we have the power to stop it. 
We must protect our seniors and keep our 
distance from each other while the virus runs 
its course. 
I know this isn’t easy, and it creates chal-
lenges of its own. 
I had a virtual small business forum with the 
Albuquerque Hispano Chamber—we heard 
stories about the tough choices small busi-
nesses must make. 
Do they layoff the workers who rely on the 
income they provide to support their families? 
Do they pay as much as they can, as long 
as they can and then close their doors for 
good? 
This bill provides a lifeline so folks can 
make it through this time when we must 
change our behavior to stop the spread of the 
virus. 
I know what it’s like to live paycheck to pay-
check, to not know if I’d be able to care for a 
family member if they were sick, or if I’d be 
able to afford a hospital bill. 
This stimulus package provides direct pay-
ments to working class families of $1,200 per 
adult, with an additional $500 available per 
child. 
It also provides a $600 per week increase in 
unemployment payments for every American, 
which pays 100 percent of wages for the aver-
age American struggling through this crisis 
without a paycheck. It also extends benefits 
for an additional 13 weeks and gives part- 
time, self-employed, tipped employees, and 
gig economy workers access to unemploy-
ment benefits. And it protects the contractors 
who keep our critical national labs running. 
We’re also acting to protect New Mexico 
small businesses. 
The bill’s Small Business Rescue Plan in-
cludes $350 billion in loan forgiveness grants 
to small businesses and non-profits to main-
tain their existing workforce and help pay ex-
penses like rent, mortgage and utilities and 
$10 billion for emergency grants of up to 
$10,000 to provide immediate relief of small 
business operating costs. 
While the bill does a lot, this isn’t the last 
action Congress must take. Even after we 
stop the spread of the virus, our families will 
need more support. 
I will be working to ensure that future bills 
make health the top priority for all people; that 
we provide economic relief directly to the peo-
ple of this country, that we rescue workers 
and communities, not corporate executives; 
that we protect our democratic process; and 
that we support the transition to a an economy 
that will promote economic security for all; 
I wish these things were in the bill we are 
voting on today, but we needed to get this bill 
passed quickly with broad bipartisan support, 
so there wasn’t time to do everything each of 
us wanted. 
I’m supporting the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act today, and I’ll keep 
fighting to protect the health, safety, and eco-
nomic security of all New Mexicans and all of 
us as we battle this pandemic. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to express my strong 
support the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security (CARES) Act. 
The coronavirus is one of the most serious 
public health threats we have ever faced, par-
ticularly for our seniors and people with under-
lying health conditions. 
That’s why I was pleased to see members 
of Congress on both sides of the aisle and the 
Trump administration work together to craft 
this $2 trillion emergency relief bill addressing 
the coronavirus pandemic—the largest emer-
gency aid bill in history. 
This legislation provides much-needed fi-
nancial assistance for individuals, families, 
small and medium-sized businesses, hos-
pitals, medical facilities and state and local 
governments. The bill also includes significant 
resources for our front-line health care work-
ers and first responders to ensure they have 
the vital equipment and medical supplies they 
need to protect the American public and them-
selves. 
Going forward, we need to dramatically 
ramp-up the supply of test kits, increase the 
number of locations where people exhibiting 
symptoms can easily get tested, and accel-
erate the process of getting results back— 
hopefully in less than 24 hours. 
We also need to accelerate the develop-
ment of an affordable, effective vaccine, con-
tinue to implement proper quarantine and self- 
isolation procedures, and ensure the safety of 
our health workers who are testing, diag-
nosing, and treating confirmed cases. 
And while I am confident that the legislation 
before us today is a significant step in the 
right direction, there is still much more work to 
be done to help my constituents and the 
American people during this unprecedented 
period of health and economic challenges. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both side of the aisle to support 
this sweeping rescue package and look for-
ward to President Trump signing it into law. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, this legislation 
is a bold, bipartisan deal to address the ongo-
ing health care crisis, protect workers, and as-
sist small businesses. 
This is first and foremost a health care cri-
sis. Until we address this pandemic, our econ-
omy will not recover. 
I was proud to lead a bipartisan letter with 
DAVE JOYCE in support of the $130 billion di-
rect hospital funding included in this bill. 
The most important thing Congress can do 
after addressing the health care crisis is to 
provide direct assistance to the American peo-
ple. 
Thanks to the tireless work of leadership 
from both parties, many individuals with work-
ing class salaries will receive a one-time direct 
payment of around $1200. 
And we have provided unemployment as-
sistance that goes well beyond the initial pro-
posal by ensuring that every worker—including 
gig workers—are protected. 
We cannot ask taxpayers to foot the bill for 
rescuing our economy without the promise of 
accountability. 
This bill prevents any secret bailouts and 
ensures no member of this administration can 
benefit from this crisis. 
Each legislative measure we pass is just a 
single step. 
There will be more need and Congress will 
need to act to address those needs as they 
arise.

H1858 
March 27, 2020 
I will be keeping in close contact with my 
constituents, so I know exactly what their 
needs are on the ground and bring that back 
to Congress so no one is forgotten or left be-
hind. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, Americans 
are scared. We are in the midst of the worst 
public health pandemic in more than 100 
years. Across our country, more than 85,000 
Americans 
have 
now 
been 
touched 
by 
coronavirus, and more than one thousand 
lives have been lost. 
Loved ones are making the difficult and 
heartbreaking choice to be absent from grand-
parents and elderly mothers and fathers, so 
that they don’t get exposed to this deadly 
virus. 
Our hospitals and medical first responders 
are doing heroic work, but worry they can’t 
meet the demands that may walk through the 
door tomorrow. 
Schools have been shuttered, while moms 
and dads are forced to figure out how to con-
tinue on and bring some normalcy to this new 
way of life. 
Businesses and restaurants are struggling, 
and many have been forced to close or lay-off 
workers. Just yesterday, we got our first 
glimpse into the devastating unemployment 
outlook—3.3 million Americans applied for as-
sistance last week. 
We have all heard these stories of this pain-
ful new reality. 
Our communities are reeling. They are 
seeking leadership, guidance, truth, empathy, 
assistance and most of all, hope for a better 
tomorrow. 
We need to be all of those things for our 
constituents—and this package is another im-
portant step. 
Nothing in life is ever perfect and this bill is 
no exception. 
But we cannot make perfect be the enemy 
of the good. 
There’s much I would like added to this leg-
islation, there are offensive provisions I’d like 
deleted. 
But the balance of aid to a hurting nation 
demands we act and act now. 
We are providing unprecedented unemploy-
ment insurance and a lifeline during this trying 
time to those who have lost their job. 
This package provides billions of dollars to 
hospitals and first responders so that they 
have the personal protective gear, ventilators, 
and the medical supplies they need to meet 
this crisis. 
Nearly every family will receive a direct pay-
ment to help cover rent, or groceries, or just 
make ends meet. 
Small businesses will have resources so 
that they can hopefully remain open and keep 
their employees on payroll. 
States and localities will see an infusion of 
federal investment to cover the challenges 
they face in providing for our neighbors. 
But our work is not done. 
The Postal Service, which every American 
relies on for prescription drugs, care pack-
ages, and critical services, is in crisis and 
must be addressed. States and local commu-
nities who are the frontlines will require more 
assistance. We must continue to meet those 
needs. 
This bill is Congress’ reaffirmation of the 
unstinting strength of the American people, a 
clarion statement in our faith in the future, a 
clear and forceful renewal in our unshakeable 
belief that our country will rise from the 
present travail, tested, resilient and renewed. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, even amid cri-
sis—and particularly in these days of social 
distancing—we should not forget to say thank 
you. 
For the third time in as many weeks Speak-
er PELOSI has led this House to respond force-
fully to the coronavirus. 
To give healthcare providers the resources 
they need to heal and halt the spread of this 
disease. 
To give families the financial aid they need 
to weather the crisis. 
And now to support the workers and busi-
nesses that are the heart of our economy. 
Throughout this unprecedented effort, nego-
tiated at lightning speed late into many nights, 
with ideologies at loggerheads and the eye of 
history upon them, always the Speaker and 
her leadership team remembered the United 
States of America includes the people of the 
Mariana Islands. 
And for that I am grateful. 
The legislation we have enacted to stop the 
coronavirus is not perfect. No legislation ever 
is. We have more work to do, until we defeat 
this disease and revive our nation. 
But I can work every day confident in the 
knowledge the people of the Marianas are 
considered every bit as much a part of this 
battle as every other American—not to be left 
behind, not forgotten. 
And for that I am grateful. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr, Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 748, the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) 
Act. Our country is suffering from a pandemic 
on an unimaginable scale, and this legislation 
will provide critical support to workers and 
families, small businesses, healthcare pro-
viders, student loan borrowers, and people 
struggling to make ends meet. 
During the global COVID–19 pandemic, it is 
clear that we need direct payments to individ-
uals to strengthen and rebuild our economy 
and to assist everyone with basics needs, 
such as rent and groceries. The pandemic has 
caused businesses to shutter without clarity 
about if or when they will be able to reopen, 
and it has left workers with the uncertainty of 
whether they will have a job to return to when 
this crisis ends. I’m pleased that this bill pro-
vides a direct cash payment of up to $1200 for 
individuals making up to $75,000, and at least 
$2400 for families making up to $150,000. 
This is a good start, but Congress will need to 
extend this assistance if the pandemic con-
tinues as expected. Last week more than 3 
million people applied for Unemployment In-
surance benefits, including more than 76,500 
claims in Oregon. This is the highest number 
in our country’s recorded history. The bill we 
are passing today will expand Unemployment 
Insurance to part-time, self-employed, and gig 
economy workers and it bolsters the weekly 
benefit by an additional $600. Incentives for 
states to eliminate waiting periods for enroll-
ment of UI and an additional 13 weeks of fed-
eral funded unemployment benefits are also 
included. Additionally, the bill includes rent as-
sistance and additional funding for SNAP. 
In addition to providing for cash payments 
and enhanced UI benefits, the bill greatly in-
creases wraparound services that families 
across the country need. The bill includes an 
increase in Low Income Home Energy Assist-
ance Program funding to help people heat and 
cool their homes, a moratorium on many evic-
tions and foreclosures, more than $30 billion 
to help school districts and higher education 
institutions, and a six-month pause on pay-
ment and interest accrual of federal student 
loans. Furthermore, I advocated for the Treas-
ury Department to temporarily halt wage gar-
nishment and collection programs for certain 
unpaid debts, and this bill incorporates provi-
sions to suspend involuntary collections of stu-
dent loans, including garnishing wages, tax re-
funds, and essential benefits like Social Secu-
rity. We also know that now, more than ever, 
we need to be taking care of our seniors and 
the most vulnerable. My legislation, the Advo-
cating for Older Americans During Coronavirus 
Crisis Act, was included in the bill. These pro-
visions will make sure that seniors in long- 
term care facilities have access to support ad-
vocates during the crisis. I also led my col-
leagues in advocating for funding for work-
force development programs for workers dis-
placed or dislocated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Although I am pleased that this bill includes 
some funding for employment services, much 
more is needed to support our nation’s eco-
nomic recovery and the success of workers. 
As a leader on the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, I will continue to fight to protect work-
ers, families, students, and seniors throughout 
this crisis. 
Additionally, many small business owners 
have had to close because of the pandemic. 
Their owners have told me that they do not 
know if or when they’ll be able to return to 
normal operations. This legislation provides 
$377 billion for small businesses, including 
$350 billion in loans for small businesses and 
non-profits to use to cover their expenses. Im-
portantly, these loans may be forgiven if the 
proceeds are used to retain employees and 
keep the businesses open. I also advocated 
on behalf of the arts and humanities commu-
nity to make sure that relief for non-profits was 
included in this bill. 
Small and medium sized farms in Northwest 
Oregon are continuing to supply our food 
chain, but this pandemic is disrupting the liveli-
hoods of farmers, their families, and their em-
ployees. I advocated for additional funding to 
send directly to farmers, and I’m pleased that 
this package includes $9.5 billion in emer-
gency funding for agriculture, including grow-
ers of our prized specialty crops. 
Our health care workers and hospitals have 
been on the front lines of fighting this pan-
demic, and this legislation secures $150 billion 
in funding to support those efforts. The bill 
makes sure those critical care providers have 
the resources they need to respond to the cri-
sis by making additional investments in public 
health infrastructure, community health sys-
tems, vaccine development, and funds for the 
purchase of critical medical supplies. Impor-
tantly, that funding will be used to acquire ur-
gently needed personal protective equipment 
(PPE) and testing supplies, as well as new fa-
cility construction to meet the demand. There 
is more we need do to get PPE into the hands 
of our health care providers and first respond-
ers, and I’ll be focusing my efforts on increas-
ing production of domestic manufacturing in 
the days and weeks ahead. 
Our frontline workers would not be able to 
do their lifesaving work without robust child 
care support. This bill provides an additional 
$3.5 billion in Child Care Development Block

Grant funding to make sure that nurses, fire-
fighters, doctors, and others who are still 
working are able to access child care, and that 
our child care providers have the financial 
support necessary to keep their doors open 
and safely care for children. There is also ad-
ditional funding for Head Start programs. 
For weeks, states have been shouldering 
the burden of combating the pandemic, and 
this bill provides critical funding to support 
their ongoing efforts. The legislation creates a 
Coronavirus Relief Fund for states, and Or-
egon will receive more than $1.6 billion to help 
pay for the costs associated with fighting 
coronavirus. The bill also contains funding for 
Community Development Block Grants, which 
will help our local communities rebuild. 
As we continue to battle this pandemic, I am 
so grateful for manufacturers across Oregon 
and around the country are stepping up and 
working on innovative ways to provide assist-
ance. The bill will make it easier for manufac-
turers to make personal protective equipment 
and get it into the hands of those who need 
it most. I championed a provision in the bill 
that increases federal funding for Manufac-
turing USA Institutes and our local manufac-
turing extension partnerships, and a cost 
share waiver so that partnerships like the Or-
egon Manufacturing Extension Partnership can 
begin their work without delay. I also advo-
cated for strengthening of the Defense Pro-
duction Act to support our manufacturers in 
meeting the PPE shortage, and I am pleased 
that this bill includes $1. billion in DPA funding 
to strengthen the domestic supply chain. 
Finally, this bill includes $500 billion in loans 
to companies to provide security to our econ-
omy. We fought tirelessly to make sure that 
these loans are subject to strong oversight 
and robust guardrails to provide accountability 
and protect the American workforce. Compa-
nies that participate in the bill’s loan program 
must not engage in stock buyback for the life 
of the loan plus one year, there are restric-
tions on executive compensation increases, 
and collective bargaining agreements are pro-
tected. The bill creates a Treasury Department 
Special Inspector General for Pandemic Re-
covery and a Pandemic Response Account-
ability Committee, as well as a Congressional 
Oversight Committee to make sure that the 
loan program is fully transparent and account-
able to the American people. Importantly, the 
bill prohibits businesses controlled by the 
President, his family, and members of Con-
gress from receiving loans under the program. 
We will continue to provide vigorous oversight 
over these companies and further advance the 
needs of workers in future legislation to pro-
mote economic recovery. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for her leadership in 
negotiating this critical package. There is 
much more work we must do on behalf of Or-
egonians and people around the country, and 
I will continue to work with my colleagues to 
enact policies to help working families. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security Act (H.R. 748). As 
America responds to the global coronavirus 
(COVID–19) pandemic, I am proud that the 
House and the Senate have worked together 
in bipartisan fashion to produce an emergency 
relief package that will rescue our economy 
from collapse and put the needs of America’s 
working families, our hospitals, and frontline 
responders first. 
In this unprecedented crisis facing our na-
tion, Congress has the obligation to take im-
mediate and bold action to protect the health 
and economic security of all Americans. That 
is why Congress has already passed two 
emergency relief bills that provided billions of 
dollars for testing, vaccine development, food 
security for vulnerable populations, and paid 
sick leave for workers. This third bill before us 
today builds on those down payments and ad-
dresses the economic security of our nation. 
H.R. 748 will ensure that America’s working 
families, our small businesses, and industries 
vital to our economic strength will survive this 
crisis and continue to thrive. This legislation 
will assist low and middle-income Americans 
by providing them immediate financial relief in 
the form of direct cash payments and ex-
panded access to unemployment benefits. It 
will provide $349 billion in loans and grants to 
small businesses to ensure that they are able 
to pay their bills and meet their payroll obliga-
tions. And, H.R. 748 will provide $150 billion 
to state, local, and tribal governments to assist 
them with their public health response and 
short-term spending shortages. 
Additionally, I was proud to work to include 
$1 billion in funding for the Community Serv-
ices Block Grant (CSBG) to assist our national 
network of over a thousand Community Action 
Agencies as they respond to this crisis. These 
agencies are in almost every county in Amer-
ica and will serve as a first line of defense for 
millions of Americans facing unemployment 
and economic hardship. 
H.R. 748 will also provide over $100 billion 
in urgently needed assistance to our hospitals, 
including $1 billion for the Indian Health Serv-
ice. Our health care workers are risking their 
own safety on the frontlines of this crisis, fight-
ing every hour of the week to save American 
lives. We must ensure that they have the pro-
tective personal equipment needed to keep 
them safe. H.R. 748 will help give them those 
tools. 
As we pass this legislation today, we know 
that our work on behalf of America’s families 
is nowhere near complete. The 116th Con-
gress will now turn to additional legislation to 
assist the sick, the unemployed, and the most 
vulnerable as we move through this period of 
national and global crisis. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, today, I cast my 
vote for the coronavirus relief package. The 
coronavirus pandemic has affected Americans 
deeply in every facet of their lives. Our gov-
ernment has asked, and in Ohio our governor 
has ordered, that Americans stay home other 
than for essential needs. Our President and 
Governor’s goal has been to keep Americans 
safe. This has put a dire strain on our econ-
omy. In addition, our hospitals are having in-
creased costs and decreased revenue. Small 
businesses are struggling to make payroll or 
even stay open. Employees are being fur-
loughed or laid off. Families are struggling to 
keep food on the table and make their mort-
gage or rent payments. 
We must now provide necessary financial 
relief to families, individuals, and businesses 
bearing the burden of the COVID–19 crisis. 
I want to thank our health care workers, gro-
cers, law enforcement, and National Guard for 
showing up to work, fighting coronavirus on 
the frontlines, and keeping our communities 
safe. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of this historic families and workers- 
first legislation. 
My own community is an epicenter of the 
coronavirus. Families in the Lower Hudson 
Valley—as in other areas of the country—have 
lost loved ones, and even as we all hunker 
down for our lives, too many fear that their 
livelihoods are still at risk when this crisis 
ends. 
Congress must come together in this his-
toric, bipartisan way to meet this crisis head- 
on and ease some of the burden on our com-
munities. This legislation will provide increased 
testing capacity, personal protective equip-
ment for health workers, funding for hospitals 
and health care providers, and research and 
development on vaccines and therapeutics as 
well as much needed resources for small busi-
nesses, schools, and state and local govern-
ments. 
This country is resilient, and I am pleased 
that this third package will give hundreds of 
millions of dollars in federal assistance to help 
Westchester and Rockland Counties recover 
from this pandemic. 
We must send this bill to the President’s 
desk today to reassure the American people 
that the federal government is united in pro-
tecting every American’s health and economic 
security. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to express my strong support for 
H.R. 748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security Act. 
Simply put, the challenges that the COVID– 
19 coronavirus pose to our country are without 
precedent. As the President has said, we are 
at war. But it is not a war against another 
country or a terrorist network, it is a war 
against a silent enemy that is ravaging our 
people and forcing us to sacrifice our eco-
nomic wellbeing. 
This is especially hurting us in rural Amer-
ica, where small businesses, rural hospitals, 
barber shops, non-profits, and the like are 
scrambling for answers and hope, 
My people in Southern and Eastern Ken-
tucky have responded to this crisis with in-
credible courage and compassion. Without 
being prompted, our people are filling in the 
gaps. I’ve heard story after story about 
healthcare workers on the frontlines despite 
not having the protective equipment they 
need; churches are shifting online and offering 
assistance to local families; and neighbors, 
teachers and community leaders are making 
sure our school children and seniors don’t 
miss a meal. 
And this bill provides the necessary con-
fidence they need to know a plan is in place 
to get through this crisis together. I was proud 
to work with House and Senate leadership to 
ensure that this bill protects our small busi-
nesses, keeps our hospitals afloat, and pro-
vides financial stability to our hardworking 
families. It also provides much needed funding 
for medical supplies, and ensures our cities, 
counties, and states have the resources nec-
essary to ensure the safety of our citizens. 
As Ranking Member of the State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee, I would also like to note that this 
bill provides critical funding for the State De-
partment to respond to the pandemic at United 
States diplomatic facilities around the globe, to 
support continued consular services to Ameri-
cans abroad, and for costs associated with

bringing home Americans that have been 
stranded overseas. Funding is also provided 
to ensure all Peace Corps volunteers get 
home safe. Lastly, funds are included to sup-
port humanitarian assistance needs related to 
the coronavirus internationally. 
But above all else, the most important thing 
this bill does is bring hope to Americans 
searching for a way to protect the health of 
their families and their livelihood. 
Mr. Speaker, since our country’s birth nearly 
250 years ago, the American people have 
faced a myriad of challenges. And in every 
one of these instances, we have pulled to-
gether and overcome. I have full faith that we 
will do so again, and this bill helps ensure that 
we will be victorious. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 748. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
this bill represents a critical compromise be-
tween both parties whose Members came to-
gether in light of the Corona virus pandemic. 
It is not perfect, but it is an important step for-
ward. I have said since the start we had to 
help workers, small businesses, and the 
health care providers who have been hit and 
intense negotiations have produced a bill that 
prioritizes the needs of our health system and 
of working families ahead of big corporations. 
I have spent the last several days reviewing 
the bill and discussing the fine points with 
leaders in our District who agree this is a good 
start—this bill will help our communities and 
get them the assistance they need right away. 
It gives hospitals a massive infusion of sup-
port, including medical supplies, such as per-
sonal protective equipment. It helps people 
who are struggling financially with rebate 
checks and a strong emergency unemploy-
ment program. And it boosts our small busi-
nesses with grants and emergency loans so 
they can keep going despite the economic toll 
this virus is taking on our communities. 
I am proud to support this bill because it 
puts workers and their families first by pro-
viding direct, individual assistance to house-
holds. It includes rebates up to $2,400 for 
families, expands unemployment benefits by 
providing up to four months of an additional 
$600 per week of unemployment insurance, 
waives the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty 
on retirement account distributions for tax-
payers facing virus-related challenges, pro-
tects the right to collective bargain, and en-
sures small businesses have the resources 
they need through the Small Business Admin-
istration. 
Moreover, this legislation provides a mas-
sive and essential boost to our overall health 
care system. It provides $100 billion for hos-
pitals and other facilities to cover the costs of 
the COVID–19 outbreak, $16 billion for the ac-
quisition of personal protective equipment for 
medical personnel, and over $50 billion for 
state, local and tribal health departments. 
I am particularly pleased that the bill ex-
panded on legislation of mine signed into law 
earlier this month, expanding the use of tele-
health and telemedicine for Medicare and 
Medicaid patients. This package not only 
broadened the scope of telehealth for these 
patients, but also adopted my legislation to en-
sure that beneficiaries can access telehealth 
services at Rural Health Clinics and Federally 
Qualified Health Centers. 
I would also note the importance of lan-
guage in the bill staving off scheduled cuts to 
Disproportionate 
Share 
Hospitals 
(DSH) 
through December 1, 2020. I am hopeful that 
Congress can come together to permanently 
address these cuts, but applaud legislators for 
ensuring that these harmful cuts do not take 
place at precisely the worst possible time. 
As Chairman of the House Subcommittee 
on Select Revenue Measures, I am pleased 
the legislation establishes a refundable Em-
ployee Retention Tax Credit, to be taken 
against federal payroll taxes, for struggling 
businesses that retain and pay their workers, 
rather than lay them off. The amount of the 
credit is equal to 50 percent of an employee’s 
qualified wages, up to a $10,000 per em-
ployee cap. Further, the bill includes modifica-
tions of the limitation on losses for taxpayers 
other than corporations, like sole proprietors; 
modifications of the credit for prior year min-
imum tax liability of corporations; modifications 
of the limitation on business interest; a tech-
nical amendment to allow businesses to write 
off costs associated with improving their facili-
ties; and a temporary exception from the ex-
cise tax for alcohol used to produce hand san-
itizer. 
The bill provides $350 billion in loan forgive-
ness grants to small businesses and non-
profits to maintain existing workforce and help 
pay for other expenses like rent, mortgage, 
and utilities; $10 billion for SBA emergency 
grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate 
relief for small business operating costs; and 
$17 billion for SBA to cover six months’ worth 
of payments for small businesses with existing 
SBA loans. 
In addition, the bill establishes a new guar-
anteed loan program at SBA for small busi-
nesses to cover payroll during the immediate 
crisis called the Paycheck Protection Program 
that would support $349 billion in 100 percent 
guaranteed, low interest, no fee loans of up to 
$10 million with repayment deferred for at 
least six months; and forgive up to 100 per-
cent of the loan if the borrower has retained 
the same number of employees as when they 
received the loan. 
Our law enforcement and first responders 
are on the front line of this crisis and I am 
proud that this bill provides $850 million for 
the Byrne-Justice Assistance Grant Program 
(Byrne-JAG). Byrne-JAG is the most flexible 
federal law enforcement grant program and 
will allow local police departments and jails to 
meet local needs, including the purchase of 
personal protective equipment and other need-
ed medical items to support officers on the 
front lines. 
For states and local governments this bill 
provides $1 billion for the Community Devel-
opment Block Grant (CDBG) program to en-
able nearly 1,240 states, counties, and cities 
to rapidly respond to COVID–19 and the eco-
nomic and housing impacts caused by it. This 
includes the expansion of community health 
facilities, child care centers, food banks, and 
senior services. To ensure resources are 
quickly deployed and meet the unique re-
sponse needs to COVID–19, the bill eliminates 
the cap on the amount of funds a grantee can 
spend on public services, removes the re-
quirement to hold in-person public hearings to 
comply with national and local social gathering 
requirements, and allows grantees to be reim-
bursed for COVID–19 response activities re-
gardless of the date the costs were incurred. 
I am continuously impressed with Ameri-
cans’ generosity during a crisis. However, dur-
ing this particular emergency, we are asked to 
stay away from people. That brings a signifi-
cant financial strain on many industries, espe-
cially those who supply/stock food. With many 
Americans losing their jobs and an inability to 
buy groceries, an increase to the Emergency 
Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) is a ne-
cessity to keep food banks fully stocked and 
supply Americans with nutritious meals. We 
must also ensure that our Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program can provide food for 
our most vulnerable populations. While $15.5 
billion was allocated to SNAP, we could use 
more. 
The last thing students, especially Pell 
Grant recipients, need to worry about is how 
to pay for their student loans or if they can 
keep their grant. I am grateful this Act defers 
student loan payments for six months and al-
lows students to keep their entitlements. The 
$30.750 billion that is allocated to the state’s 
Education Stabilization Fund will ensure Amer-
ica’s learners are still able to operate remotely 
and can continue to develop to their full poten-
tial, regardless of their learning location. 
To alleviate the anticipated strain on our 
healthcare system, the bill provides funds for 
the Department of Defense to contribute its 
unique capabilities to the whole-of-government 
response to the pandemic. These funds will 
support the deployment of the USNS Mercy 
hospital ship to Los Angeles and the USNS 
Comfort to New York, deployments of the Na-
tional Guard to support state and local re-
sponse efforts, and the expansion of military 
hospitals and expeditionary hospitals. To help 
bolster the supply chains for medical equip-
ment, the bill provides $1 billion for the De-
fense Production Act to help industry ramp up 
production of personal protective equipment, 
ventilators, and other urgently needed medical 
supplies for federal, state, and local health 
agencies. 
The bill protects our veterans by ensuring 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has 
the equipment, tests, and services necessary 
to support a surge in demand and provide the 
additional care they need at facilities nation-
wide. In particular, I am pleased the bill sup-
ports the needs of veterans at an increased 
risk of infection. Funding is included for the 
Health Care for Homeless Veterans Program 
and for keeping veterans within VA-run nurs-
ing homes and community living centers safe 
from the coronavirus. 
This is not our last legislative effort to help 
our Nation and the people we represent. I 
have already begun conversations with our 
local leaders and with my colleagues in Con-
gress about what will be in our next relief 
package. We will get through this together. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the third COVID–19 relief pack-
age—the CARES Act. House and Senate 
leadership has worked tirelessly around-the- 
clock to find middle ground to deliver tangible 
relief to communities around the country reel-
ing from the impacts of COVID–19. 
The final bipartisan compromise that was 
negotiated over the last few days included 
some meaningful changes with input from the 
House of Representatives, including major ad-
ditional investments in the health care sector 
that was missing from the original bill. These 
investments include an additional $100 billion 
for hospitals and health care providers, $16 
billion for the production and purchase of per-
sonal protective equipment (PPE) and ventila-
tors, and $11 billion to fund critical, lifesaving

medical research so that we may better under-
stand this virus and someday soon, have a 
vaccine to stop it. 
While our state and local governments are 
making heroic efforts to combat COVID–19, 
there is no doubt they need additional support. 
The revised CARES Act does just that—pro-
viding over one billion dollars at a minimum to 
every state in the nation to fight this, including 
$1.38 billion for Connecticut. This funding will 
be critical to make sure we can get the job 
done. 
Mr. Speaker, while there is more work to be 
done to support our constituents through this 
crisis, the CARES Act is a much-needed step 
in the right direction, and I urge its immediate 
passage. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today’s 
vote is a welcome sign to the hundreds of 
thousands of Oregonians I represent who are 
worried about staying healthy, keeping their 
job, and paying their bills. This legislation is by 
no means perfect, nor does it do nearly 
enough to stop the spread of COVID–19, but 
it is immeasurably better than the Senate’s ini-
tial bill. I strongly support this legislation today, 
but it is critical that we start working imme-
diately on the next bill to speed the recovery 
of our economy and strengthen the healthcare 
system. 
Americans 
need 
a 
coordinated, 
whole-of-government 
response 
to 
provide 
healthcare and economic security during the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Security (CARES) Act of 2020 includes many 
of the provisions that I advocated for in my 
Economic Stabilization Plan. First, the bill in-
cludes direct cash assistance of $1,200 per in-
dividual and $2,400 for married couples. The 
bill also includes a temporary expansion of 
Unemployment Insurance so that workers af-
fected by COVID–19 and eligible for unem-
ployment compensation—including non-tradi-
tional employment like the self-employed and 
gig workers—receive an extra $600 per week, 
resulting in weekly benefits that replace 100 
percent of wages for the average worker. 
For local businesses, the bill provides nearly 
$350 billion in forgivable loans and grants to 
small businesses and non-profits so they can 
continue to pay their employees and cover 
other expenses during this crisis, like rent, 
mortgage payments, or utilities. Small busi-
nesses also will have access to emergency 
grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate 
relief for operating costs once a small busi-
ness or non-profit has applied for an Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Loan. Finally, this legis-
lation creates a new employee retention tax 
credit for employers to encourage businesses 
to keep workers on payroll during the crisis. 
Importantly, House and Senate Democrats 
fixed a glaring flaw in the Republican bill by 
adding important restrictions on the federal 
loan assistance for larger businesses, includ-
ing a prohibition on excessive executive com-
pensation and stock buybacks and a require-
ment that the businesses keep workers em-
ployed. We also set up an independent In-
spector General and Congressional Oversight 
Panel to closely monitor this program, a 
marked improvement to the no-strings at-
tached bailout we saw in 2008. While I still 
have strong concerns about how the Trump 
administration will administer this program, I 
am committed to closely monitoring the pro-
gram and working with my colleagues to add 
even more restrictions in future legislation. 
This crisis is of course a health crisis, and 
this bill includes hundreds of billions of dollars 
in funding to support America’s healthcare 
system. In particular, the bill creates a $100 
billion fund for hospitals and providers hit 
hardest by the outbreak. These funds can be 
used to purchase personal protective equip-
ment for health workers, testing supplies, addi-
tional equipment to deal with a surge of se-
verely ill patients, and other necessities that 
hospitals desperately need. The CARES Act 
of 2020 also provides funding for our public 
health infrastructure, like community health 
centers, which are critical to our COVID–19 
response. 
I am also pleased that this legislation pro-
tects the integrity of our elections during this 
pandemic by providing resources to states to 
increase election accessibility, which could in-
clude voting by mail. I am working with Speak-
er PELOSI and Chairperson LOFGREN to ex-
pand 
upon 
this 
language 
in 
the 
next 
coronavirus legislation to guarantee that every 
American can do what we do already in Or-
egon—vote by mail. 
I also commend the important safeguards 
we have put in place so that no new money 
intended to help keep our country safe is di-
verted to building a wall on the southern bor-
der or used to further separate immigrant fam-
ilies. 
While this legislation provides more re-
sources for healthcare workers and tempo-
rarily stabilizes parts of the economy, it is only 
one step Congress must take. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in working on the next 
phase of our legislative response. Any future 
package must have more resources for 
healthcare workers to effectively stop the 
spread of COVID–19, additional funding for 
long-term economic certainty for workers and 
families, and actions to permanently strength-
en the social safety net. We must do more to 
provide for safe and secure elections and 
must also address the climate crisis head on. 
I look forward to continuing to work with my 
colleagues and the people I represent to build 
on this legislation to do more of what is need-
ed. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I did 
not come to the U.S. House of Representa-
tives to vote for stimulus packages or bailouts. 
I didn’t come here to spend trillions of dol-
lars or grow the size of government. 
However, the situation we are in today, in 
the United States and across the world, is dif-
ferent. 
We aren’t in this situation because we’ve 
come to the end of a business cycle. 
We aren’t here because mortgage lenders 
or Wall Street made bad decisions. 
We are here because our economy, with the 
help of regulatory and tax relief, was going 
strong, and we want to resume that strength 
when conditions permit. 
Three million Americans applied for unem-
ployment benefits last week, not because the 
fundamentals of our economy changed, but 
because President Trump, and governors and 
mayors across our country, asked them to 
stay home as much as possible for a while, to 
help protect their families, friends, and neigh-
bors. 
We should all be proud of how well most 
Americans have heeded that request. 
We owe Americans the opportunity to re-
sume their lives, return to their jobs, resume 
their education, keep their homes, and feed 
their families just as they were before this 
pandemic arrived, and this bill addresses 
many barriers to that happening. 
Employers don’t want to shut down and lay 
employees off. This bill will help many avoid 
having to. 
Americans want to work and support their 
families. The short-term changes to unemploy-
ment help those who don’t currently have that 
choice. 
This bill also ensures our commercial avia-
tion system, including the contractors who 
support it, which were strong prior to this pan-
demic, can resume serving our nation, includ-
ing its most rural parts, when this pandemic 
ends. 
Hospitals want to be there for everyone in 
their community. Provisions like the enhanced 
advance-pay assistance will help the 55 crit-
ical-access hospitals in Nebraska keep their 
doors open as they pause addressing less im-
mediate needs, and expanded telehealth avail-
ability will benefit rural Americans even after 
this crisis is over. 
And provisions such as funding for the 
Commodity Credit Corporation will help our ag 
producers get through this difficult time and 
continue to feed Americans, who more than 
ever are understanding the complexity and re-
liability of our food production system, from 
farm to table. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not the bill any single 
one of us would have written on our own, but 
I will support it today because it is a strong 
compromise which provides our best available 
opportunity to help Americans get through this 
difficult period and return to their jobs, 
schools, churches, friends, and regular daily 
lives in the shortest time possible. 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I am unable to vote on the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. 
Had I been present, I would have voted AYE. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Se-
curity Act. 
The coronavirus has changed our lives. 
Hospitals are being overwhelmed, businesses 
are closing, and the American people are anx-
ious of getting COVID–19 or losing a loved 
one to the disease. 
Workers are asking: When will I be able to 
go back to work? How will I be able to pay my 
bills? 
Small business owners are asking: can my 
business stay afloat? 
In my own community, California’s 36th dis-
trict, I have heard from single mothers who 
are worried about how they will pay their rent, 
workers who have been laid off and wondering 
how will they put food on their table, and small 
business owners who cannot afford to pay 
their employees or even their rent. 
That is why we must pass the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act imme-
diately. 
The bipartisan CARES Act will help Amer-
ican families, workers, and businesses through 
this uncertain and tumultuous time by: pro-
viding $1200 in direct payments to individuals 
and $2400 for families, and $500 for every 
child; expanding unemployment insurance 
benefits to match the average paycheck of laid 
off or furloughed workers; providing $377 bil-
lion dollars in relief for small businesses; in-
vesting $200 billion in our hospitals, health 
care infrastructure, and research, among other 
things.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1862 
March 27, 2020 
By passing this bill, we are telling the small 
business owner that help is on the way. We 
are telling the health care workers that we 
support you. We are telling the single mother 
who is now unemployed that you are not 
alone, that we are fighting for you, and that to-
gether, we will get through this. 
The American people need a comprehen-
sive, whole-of-government response to keep 
our nation safe. 
That is why I urge the House to immediately 
and unanimously pass the CARES Act to help 
fight the spread of the virus, provide financial 
security to American families and businesses, 
and ultimately, save lives. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the small businesses and nonprofits that are 
experiencing tremendous impacts from the 
coronavirus right now. 
I’ve talked to dozens of small business own-
ers, some of whom have taken out second 
mortgages to keep their businesses afloat and 
their employees paid. 
I’ve talked with many nonprofits in the Sec-
ond District, all of whom are feeling over-
extended but tirelessly showing up everyday 
to meet the needs of their communities. 
It’s clear that small businesses are the eco-
nomic engine in suburbs, rural towns and cit-
ies and nonprofits keep our neighborhoods 
strong. That’s why I pushed for no interest, 
forgivable loans to get back to our districts as 
fast as possible. I’m glad to see these loans 
included in the CARES Act. 
I believe supporting our local economic en-
gines is something we can all agree on. I look 
forward to seeing this swiftly become law and 
get these resources to hard working Minneso-
tans. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, in Minnesota and 
across the country, schools are closing and 
distance learning is being implemented. I led 
an effort with my colleagues Rep. PETE 
STAUBER from Northern Minnesota and Rep. 
JARED HUFFMAN from California to make sure 
our schools have the additional IDEA funding 
to support all their students, including those 
with special needs during this exceptionally 
difficult time. 
I’m proud that the CARES Act includes $30 
Billion to support our students and edu-
cators—and that $13 Billion of this is available 
to school districts and schools to make sure 
that students who have IEPs get high quality 
education they would in school, in their 
homes. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting our teachers, paraprofessionals, 
and school administrators who are working 
tirelessly to continue to educate all students in 
our communities through equal access to 
quality education. 
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 748, the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security Act. 
The dire situation facing our nation’s busi-
nesses today are not of their own creation. In-
stead, businesses are endangered by the 
drastic actions taken by governments at the 
local, state, and federal level to combat the 
spread of the Coronavirus. The stark truth is 
that without immediate government action to 
assist these hard-hit businesses, many of 
them will not survive the current crisis. We 
have already seen record unemployment 
claims during the coronavirus shutdown, and 
our nation cannot afford for businesses to con-
tinue to go under and millions of employees to 
lose their jobs, their livelihoods, and their abil-
ity to pay rent and make ends meet. 
The CARES Act will provide crucial assist-
ance to keep businesses solvent during this 
emergency, keep people employed, and to 
help individuals and families struggling with 
these extraordinary circumstances. I regret 
that the Democrats, from the beginning, have 
exploited this bill to try to ram through extra-
neous and partisan measures with no connec-
tion whatsoever to helping families and busi-
nesses overcome their current hardships. Nev-
ertheless, at a time when many Americans are 
unsure how they’ll pay next month’s rent and 
many American businesses are unsure how 
much longer they can last, this bill will provide 
vital support to the American economy. That’s 
why I will vote for the CARES Act. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, Americans’ health 
and American jobs are being attacked by an 
invisible virus. 
And this House is called to respond. 
Families and workers across the nation des-
perately need our help. And they need it now. 
Every American has to pay rent, pay their 
mortgage, and buy groceries. 
Over the past week, I’ve heard stories of 
people struggling. A young mother concerned 
about losing her job while caring for her kids. 
A small gym owner concerned that she will 
have to lay off her eight employees. And a 
doctor concerned about the coming weeks 
and lack of space, supplies, and ventilators for 
patients. 
America is fighting on two fronts—a public 
health crisis and an economic crisis. On one 
side, we have a public health crisis. Our 
nurses, doctors, and health professionals are 
on the front lines of this pandemic. Their work 
is keeping thousands of Americans safe, 
healthy, and alive. And on the other, we have 
the crippling economic impacts. Businesses 
are shuttered and record numbers are becom-
ing unemployed. Families need relief now. 
While far from perfect, the CARES Act pro-
vides relief. We are ensuring that coronavirus 
testing is free and accessible for everyone. 
We are giving doctors, nurses, and hospitals 
supplies needed to keep themselves and their 
patients safe. We are protecting the pay-
checks of people working at places like res-
taurants and hotels. We are supporting states’ 
efforts to address the pandemic. We are pro-
viding assistance to workers who lose their 
jobs due to the corona virus crisis. 
Importantly, this bill continues to fix past 
mistakes made by this House. The CARES 
Act includes yet another fix to the poorly draft-
ed Medicaid language included in the original 
version of the second corona virus emergency 
response legislation. It is vital that we get this 
language right so states like Wisconsin have 
the dollars we need to ensure health care is 
available to our most vulnerable populations. 
At times, this bill leaves much to be desired. 
I remain concerned about unnecessary provi-
sions included in the bill. This exacerbates 
Congress’ unnecessary spending habits, in-
cluding $25 million for a Washington, D.C. the-
ater. I am disappointed that no amendments 
were allowed to be added to this bill. 
However, the Senate did its job. President 
Trump continues to do his. Now, the House 
must do ours. We cannot let the perfect be the 
enemy of the good. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, as we adopt the 
third installment of COVID relief in one month, 
millions of Americans are counting on Con-
gress to chart a course forward and lead the 
nation out of this crisis. Today’s vote delivers 
significant resources to the American people, 
our economy, and our nation’s health care de-
livery system. The hundreds of billions of dol-
lars included for our health providers, paired 
with a massive injection of economic assist-
ance for our small businesses will give med-
ical professionals and financial institutions the 
tools they need to help our nation weather this 
storm. 
Unfortunately, this bill also spends millions 
of taxpayer dollars on programs unrelated to 
combating the coronavirus. Efforts to fund pet 
projects and attempts to further a political 
agenda at a time like this are completely un-
acceptable, and I, like so many of my constitu-
ents, am disgusted and appalled with the par-
tisan maneuvering that delayed passage of 
this legislation. The important relief included in 
this bill is now not only several days overdue, 
but it saddles future generations with an even 
larger federal debt burden they will be forced 
to grapple with, in the years to come, all be-
cause of ‘‘politics as usual’’ in Washington. 
I supported today’s relief package because 
I believe in the resolve of the American people 
and the resiliency of the American economy. I 
will continue to support the countless men and 
women working around the clock to provide 
lifesaving medical care, and I look forward to 
working with our community lenders and small 
businesses as they remind the world of just 
how dynamic they can be. By working to-
gether, we will overcome this crisis and re-
emerge a stronger and more prosperous na-
tion. 
Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, the Seventh Con-
gressional District of Missouri’s economy has 
a significant dependence on seasonal outdoor 
amusement and entertainment including the 
Ozark Empire Fair, the carnivals on the mid-
ways of county fairs, and the nation’s favorite 
vacation spot, Branson. These for profit and 
not for profit enterprises employ thousands of 
Ozarkians, some year-round and the majority 
just in the season. 
Branson in the Missouri Ozarks draws about 
nine million visitors a year, mainly during a 
nine-month season. From the world-famous 
Silver Dollar City to the celebrated country 
music venues and all attractions in between, 
including excellent bass fishing, world class 
golf, youth baseball tournaments, and endless 
outdoor adventures, Branson is a premier des-
tination in America. 
But these are not normal times. 
Springfield, Missouri is home to the Inter-
national Association of Fairs and Expositions 
(IAFE). 
Agricultural Fairs—county fairs, state fairs 
and regional ag shows—are deeply rooted in 
our heritage and history, with the mission to 
promote and advance agriculture, horticulture, 
domestic industry, with a focused emphasis on 
youth leadership development through com-
petitions, education, and leadership opportuni-
ties. 
Most fairs, a total of 2,092 in the US, also 
provide exceptional educational activities to 
help today’s Americans understand the impor-
tance of farming and the source of the food on 
their plate. 
Fairs cannot function without a complex ar-
rangement of carnival midway operations, food 
and beverage operations, livestock shows, ex-
hibits and demonstrations. With nearly 300 
fairs happening across America in July alone

each year, it is impossible to reschedule a fair 
for a different time. 
According to the IAFE, each year the oper-
ation of agricultural fairs results in $4.67 billion 
for the US economy and provides thousands 
of jobs. 
Fairs and their carnival partners on the mid-
way have been devastated by the cancellation 
of events thus far. IAFE estimates a loss of 
revenue exceeding $1.4 billion to the fair and 
festival core organizations just for March 
through May. 
The Outdoor Amusement Business Associa-
tion (OABA) represents some 200 carnivals, 
15 circuses and hundreds of traveling food/ 
game concessionaires in the United States. 
The vast majority of their members are small, 
family businesses, many in their third or more 
generation of ownership. The OABA estimates 
350 carnival events have currently been 
closed through May I. Based on historical at-
tendance data and this estimated performance 
cancellations, the lost revenue to carnival op-
erators is near $250 million. 
Should the need for social distancing or 
total quarantine exist into the summer, the 
economic devastation will inevitably put these 
community organizations as well as many of 
the small businesses in the allied sectors out 
of business. Thousands of jobs will be lost. 
Because both the not-for-profit fair sector 
and the outdoor amusement business seg-
ment are unique subsets of our economic and 
commercial activities, we must ensure they 
are not excluded from any current or new SBA 
programs and they are just as eligible for fed-
eral support from the new $500 billion fund 
provided to the Treasury as any Wall Street 
traded company. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the bipartisan agreement reached on 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 748, the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act. 
This bill will provide immediate relief to my 
constituents in California’s 19th District by pro-
viding direct cash payments to families, ex-
panding unemployment, infusing $150 billion 
investment in our healthcare system, and sup-
porting small businesses with hundreds of bil-
lions that will also ensure continued employ-
ment for America’s workers. 
As one of the hardest hit communities in the 
country, we know that Santa Clara County 
cannot afford to wait any longer. Our hos-
pitals, health centers, and county health offi-
cials specifically need the healthcare invest-
ment immediately to add capacity, work to-
ward universal testing, and procure more 
masks, gloves, and gowns to guarantee our 
healthcare workers have the appropriate pro-
tections to do their jobs safely and effectively. 
Families in our community and around the 
country need immediate assistance in the form 
of direct cash payments and expanded unem-
ployment insurance (UI). This week a record 
number of Americans filed unemployment 
claims. They need this substantial expansion 
and reform of UI benefits, which includes a 
$600 increase in the weekly maximum benefit 
and coverage for self-employed and gig econ-
omy workers, like the thousands of tech indus-
try workers in Silicon Valley. 
California small businesses need the $350 
billion lifeline to help cover rent, mortgage, 
and utility payments and keep workers em-
ployed so that they can pick up where they left 
off when this crisis is over. In addition, the $10 
billion for small business emergency grants 
will provide entrepreneurs and family-sus-
taining employers in Santa Clara County with 
more immediate assistance. 
The CARES Act also includes $25 billion for 
public transit agencies, like the Santa Clara 
Valley Transportation Authority, to keep serv-
ice running while keeping employees and pas-
sengers safe. An additional $3 billion dollars in 
grants will keep contracted workers employed 
at our nation’s airports, including at San Jose 
Mineta International Airport. 
This bill will provide much needed and 
awaited relief for American workers, families, 
small businesses, and healthcare systems, but 
it is apparent that more will need to be done. 
I will continue to work with my colleagues in 
the House and Senate to address specific 
community needs in future legislation. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, Americans 
have voted during times of great strife in the 
past. They voted during the Civil War, and in 
the shadow of World War II. Americans stand 
united to vote this year, as well. Coronavirus 
must not impede our elections. 
Some states are postponing primaries and 
planning for a large increase in absentee vot-
ing this November. State and local officials 
need time and adequate resources to ensure 
an orderly election. 
The Senate Amendment to H.R. 748, the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES) Act, provides $400 million to the 
Election Assistance Commission to make 
grants that prevent, prepare for, and respond 
to the pandemic and the 2020 elections. The 
money will be provided as ‘‘Election Security 
Grants.’’ Although this is an important down 
payment and a first step, I am concerned that 
it falls short of what is necessary. 
By contrast, the House’s Take Responsi-
bility for Workers and Families Act (H.R. 
6379), which I coauthored, would have pro-
vided $4 billion in funding to states to carry 
out this year’s elections. It would require offi-
cials to mail an absentee ballot to all reg-
istered voters during an emergency, including 
COVID–19. The ballot would be provided with 
prepaid return postage and a self-sealing en-
velope. It would set a minimum nationwide 
standard of 15 consecutive days of early vot-
ing and no-excuse absentee voting. The 
House bill would also require online voter reg-
istration and same-day registration—important 
solutions to cover voters who may have been 
wrongfully purged or otherwise unregistered. 
There is more to do to protect our democ-
racy and bolster its resilience. The House’s 
package provides those milestones. I will con-
tinue to work with my House and Senate col-
leagues to address election preparedness in 
future legislation to respond to this pandemic. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 
time is of the essence. Our country has been 
upended by COVID–19. Businesses have 
shuttered their doors, families sitting around 
their kitchen tables are struggling to make 
ends meet, our healthcare workers are 
stretched thin, and our economy has been 
hurt. 
Yet, earlier this week, some of my col-
leagues across the aisle attempted to com-
mandeer negotiations to advance socialist pro-
visions that are antithetical to combatting 
COVID–19. Now is not the time for political 
showmanship. The eyes of our nation are af-
fixed to Congress, and it’s our solemn duty to 
protect the American people. 
To our nation’s deeply committed healthcare 
workers who put their lives on the line to treat 
and protect patients, our nation’s truck drivers 
who deliver food and critical supplies to gro-
cery stores and businesses, manufacturers 
who have stepped up to the plate to produce 
PPE’s and other essential equipment, and our 
steadfast police officers and first responders 
on the front lines of this crisis, we truly owe 
you a debt of gratitude. May God bless you 
all. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, during a time when our nation is facing an 
unprecedented crisis, I am grateful to join 
President Donald Trump in supporting the 
CARES Act to provide American families re-
covery from the coronavirus. Even though I 
am not completely happy with every aspect of 
this bill, it does addresses multiple parts of our 
economy, specifically, it expedites resources 
to healthcare providers and patients, supports 
small businesses, to keep jobs alive, and pro-
vides direct assistance to American families. 
To fast track a national recovery, I ask that 
we all do our part in stopping the spread of 
the coronavirus by following the Center for 
Disease Control’s guidelines. The health and 
safety of our nation is the top priority, I am 
confident we will push through and come out 
of this crisis stronger than ever. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD this Statement of Intent on Data Re-
quired for General Recognition of Safety and 
Effectiveness. 
The OTC drug monograph reform legislation 
requires that nonprescription drugs be shown 
to be generally recognized as safe and effec-
tive. This standard of general recognition is 
based on statutory language that has been in 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
since its enactment in 1938, and it was incor-
porated in the regulations issued by the Food 
and Drug Administration when the OTC Drug 
Review was established in 1972. In particular, 
21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(i) states that: 
. . . Proof of safety shall consist of ade-
quate tests by methods reasonably applica-
ble to show the drug is safe under the pre-
scribed, recommended, or suggested condi-
tions of use. This proof shall include results 
of significant human experience during mar-
keting. General recognition of safety shall 
ordinarily be based upon published studies 
which may be corroborated by unpublished 
studies and other data. 
Similarly, 21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(ii) states 
that: 
. . . Proof of effectiveness shall consist of 
controlled clinical investigations as defined 
in § 314.126(b) of this chapter, unless this re-
quirement has been waived on the basis of a 
showing that it is not reasonably applicable 
to the drug or essential to the validity of the 
investigation and that an alternative meth-
od of investigation is adequate to substan-
tiate effectiveness. Investigations may be 
corroborated by partially controlled or un-
controlled 
studies, 
documented 
clinical 
trials by qualified experts, and reports of sig-
nificant 
human 
experience 
during 
mar-
keting. Isolated case reports, random experi-
ence, and reports lacking the details which 
permit scientific investigation will not be 
considered. General recognition shall ordi-
narily be based upon published studies which 
may be corroborated by unpublished studies 
and other data. 
These regulations clearly recognize the im-
portance of what is now termed ‘‘real world 
evidence,’’ including experience from mar-
keting, in determining general recognition of

safety and effectiveness. In addition, they rec-
ognize that results of clinical studies sup-
porting general recognition of safety and effec-
tiveness will in most instances be contained in 
the published scientific literature. Such publi-
cations seldom, if ever, contain the same level 
of detail as the clinical study reports and data 
tabulations submitted in support of new drug 
applications, but it has long been understood 
that they may form the basis for determina-
tions of general recognition of safety and ef-
fectiveness under the OTC monograph sys-
tem. Finally, the regulations clearly permit de-
terminations of general recognition of safety 
and effectiveness to be based on sources of 
information other than the published scientific 
literature, including, for example, unpublished 
data from studies carried out by federal gov-
ernment agencies or other competent bodies 
which are made available to the FDA in the 
process of administering the OTC monograph 
system. It is our intent that the FDA should 
continue to apply these standards in making 
determinations of general recognition of safety 
and effectiveness under the monograph re-
form legislation. 
STATEMENT OF INTENT AS TO MINOR CHANGES 
PROVISION 
Under current law, dosage forms for mono-
graph OTC drugs have largely been limited to 
the technology in use in 1972, when the OTC 
Drug Review began. The only mechanism for 
introducing truly innovative dosage forms has 
been through the new drug application (NDA) 
process, which entails disproportionate costs 
and delays. This has proved to be a significant 
hurdle to use of new technologies that could 
offer consumers greater convenience and 
choice in OTC drug products. 
The legislation creates two new procedures 
for introducing innovative dosage forms for 
monograph OTC drugs that would not other-
wise be permitted under subsection (b). 
First, sponsors may initiate proceedings for 
the issuance of administrative orders under 
subsection (c) to provide for use of novel dos-
age forms. 
Second, in appropriate cases, sponsors may 
make minor changes in dosage forms without 
prior approval from FDA, using the procedure 
in subsection (d). The sponsor must maintain 
information necessary to demonstrate that the 
change will not affect the safety or effective-
ness of the drug or materially affect the extent 
of absorption or other exposure to the drug in 
comparison to a suitable reference product. 
The sponsor must also submit updated drug 
listing information to FDA within 30 days of in-
troducing the new product to the market. FDA 
will have the right to demand access to the 
relevant files, and there will be a quick and 
simple procedure to resolve any disagreement 
between FDA and the sponsor as to the ade-
quacy of the data supporting the change. Be-
fore the subsection (d) procedure takes effect, 
FDA must issue administrative orders setting 
out the type of information required to support 
minor changes in dosage forms. In issuing 
those orders, FDA will take account of stand-
ard procedures and practices for evaluating 
the quality of drug products, including applica-
ble provisions of the United States Pharma-
copeia/National Formulary, as well as special 
needs of populations, including children. 
The procedures in subsections (c) and (d) 
will only be required for changes that would 
not otherwise be permitted under subsection 
(b). Thus, changes in excipients or other inac-
tive ingredients and similar aspects of formula-
tion of monograph OTC drug products will be 
permitted without prior approval provided they 
are fully consistent with requirements of appli-
cable monographs or administrative orders 
and with general requirements for monograph 
OTC drugs, including, among other things, re-
quirements for the use of suitable inactive in-
gredients which are safe in the amounts ad-
ministered and do not interfere with the effec-
tiveness of the preparation or with suitable 
tests or assays. When such changes are 
made, sponsors will be required to submit up-
dated drug listing information to FDA within 30 
days of introducing a product to the market.

ADMINISTRATIVE
ORDER
WITH 
GUIDANCES BY ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION 
An important objective of this legislation is 
to create procedures that will promote innova-
tion by permitting manufacturers to introduce 
certain new and improved dosage forms for 
nonprescription monograph drugs without the 
need for prior FDA approval. Manufacturers 
will be required to maintain files containing 
data showing that such changes will not affect 
the safety or effectiveness of their products 
and provide those files to FDA on request. 
The bill directs FDA to issue administrative or-
ders and guidances describing the types of 
changes that can be made without prior ap-
proval and the data that manufacturers should 
have on file. Subsection (d)(3)(B) requires 
that, in issuing such orders and guidances, 
FDA should take account of relevant public 
standards for evaluating the quality of drug 
products. Examples of the standards that FDA 
should take into account include the mono-
graphs and other provisions of United States 
Pharmacopeia/National Formulary and guide-
lines issued by the International Conference 
on Harmonization of Technical Requirements 
for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use (ICH). FDA is a major stakeholder in both 
organizations, and it is appropriate that any 
administrative orders it adopts should take ac-
count of relevant requirements issued by 
them. 
LABELING CONSIDERATIONS UNDER MINOR CHANGES 
PROVISION 
This bill establishes procedures under which 
FDA can issue binding administrative orders 
setting forth the requirements under which 
nonprescription drugs will be regarded as gen-
erally recognized as safe and effective and 
may be lawfully marketed without an approved 
new drug application. It is intended that these 
orders will be similar in content to the mono-
graphs that FDA has issued under the current 
procedures of the Over-the-Counter (OTC) 
Drug Review. That is, they will contain provi-
sions concerning active ingredients, dosages 
and dosage forms, and instructions for safe 
use of the products to which they apply and, 
where appropriate, other conditions required to 
assure safety and effectiveness. Nonprescrip-
tion drugs marketed under such orders must 
also comply with general requirements of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 
applicable FDA regulations, including general 
requirements for labeling and quality. As is 
true under the current regulatory system, la-
bels and labeling for nonprescription drugs 
may contain additional information, including 
brand names, promotional statements, and 
other information, provided that any such infor-
mation is truthful and non-misleading. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, the 
health and economic crisis caused by COVID– 
19 is unprecedented in our lifetimes. We are 
seeing the number of cases rise throughout 
the country, including in my home state of Ar-
kansas. After being in nearly constant commu-
nication with the Arkansas Governor’s office, 
hospitals, first responders, and business lead-
ers in Arkansas, relief from the federal govern-
ment is needed to help fight this virus and 
help keep our businesses from going under. It 
is for these reasons that if a roll call vote is 
called for the vote on the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security Act, I will vote yes. 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to state that 
if there is a recorded vote, I would vote: ‘‘yea’’ 
on H.R. 748, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security Act, as amended. 
As referenced in my earlier remarks during 
the H.R. 748 debate, this legislation takes vital 
steps to send cash to struggling Texas fami-
lies, provide economic relief for small busi-
nesses and working Americans, and give our 
healthcare providers more of the resources 
they need. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 911, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
motion. 
The question is on adoption of the

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF PHIL SANGUINETTI 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
the 100th birthday of Phil Sanguinetti. 
Mr. Sanguinetti was born in 1920 in Norfolk, 
Virginia. He graduated from Virginia Tech in 
1942 and received a master’s degree from the 
University of Tennessee in 1948. He was a 
chemist at Monsanto from 1942 to 1954, and 
director of technical sales at Mobay Chemical 
Company from 1954 to 1962. He married Elise 
Ayers in 1950. 
He began working at The Anniston Star in 
1962 as national advertising manager. He was 
later named business manager, vice president 
and in 1973 named president of the company. 
He has held leadership positions with Inter-
national House at Jacksonville State University 
and Anniston Community Theater. He has 
also been active at Grace Episcopal Church. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Sanguinetti, his contributions and 
dedication to the Anniston area and wishing 
him a very happy 100th birthday.

CONGRESSIONAL TEACHERS 
AWARD 
HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of outstanding public 
school teachers in Florida’s 16th Congres-
sional District. 
I was once told that children are 25 percent 
of the population, but they are 100 percent of 
the future. 
And it’s true. The education of a child is an 
investment, not only in that student, but in the 
future of our country. 
An independent panel has chosen the fol-
lowing teachers from Manatee, Sarasota and 
Hillsborough counties for Florida’s 16th District 
2020 Congressional Teacher Award for their 
accomplishments as educators: 
Jessica Brumby for her accomplishments as 
a 4th Grade Teacher at Ballard Elementary 
School in Bradenton; 
Linda Bolno for her accomplishments as a 
Kindergarten and 1st Grade Teacher at 
Rowlett Academy in Bradenton; 
Jennifer Holt for her accomplishments as an 
8th Grade Science Teacher at SCF Collegiate 
School in Bradenton; 
Thomas Desmond for his accomplishments 
as a Music and Choral Teacher for Grades 9 
through 12 at Braden River High School in 
Bradenton; 
Kristen Costa for her accomplishments as a 
Behavior Specialist for Pre-K through 5th 
Grade at Fruitville Elementary School in Sara-
sota; 
Bryan Burns for his accomplishments as a 
7th and 8th Grade Teacher at Sarasota Mili-
tary Academy Prep in Sarasota; 
Robert Perkins for his accomplishments as 
a Math Teacher for Grades 9 through 12 at 
Sarasota High School in Sarasota; and 
Sandra Misciasci for her accomplishments 
as a 9th Grade Reading Teacher at Newsome 
High School in Lithia. 
On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th 
District, I congratulate each of these out-
standing teachers and offer my sincere appre-
ciation for their service and dedication.

RESEARCH 
INSTITUTE 
TREATMENT 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize researchers at the Ar-
kansas Children’s Research Institute for their 
hard work in developing a treatment for pea-
nut allergy in children. 
Recently, the FDA announced the approval 
of Palforzia, an oral immune therapy that 
gradually desensitizes children to peanut pro-
teins. 
This therapy has the potential to greatly re-
duce allergy-related deaths in children, given 
that 2.5 percent of children suffer from peanut 
allergies. 
This treatment would not have been pos-
sible without the research of Dr. Stacie Jones 
and her team on oral immune therapy. 
They developed the methods used in the 
trials for this peanut allergy treatment. 
I am proud to have such a skilled team of 
experts in my district at Children’s Hospital, 
where I served on the board of directors for 14 
years.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
RICHARD BERNARD MORRIS 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and work of an extraordinary 
man, Richard Bernard Morris, who was born 
March 9, 1930 in Alameda, California, to Thel-
ma T. and John E. Morris, and was the fifth 
of seven children. He passed away sur-
rounded by his beloved family on Tuesday, 
January 21, 2020, at the age of 89. 
Richard Morris attended Piedmont High 
School and attended the University of Santa 
Clara for one year prior to entering the Society 
of Jesus. In 1955, he left the seminary to join 
the United States Army and was stationed in 
Germany for two years. 
After his military service, he completed his 
Bachelor of Arts degree at UC Berkeley and 
attended law school at Boalt Hall (Berkeley 
Law). It was at Berkeley where he met his 
best pal and true love, Anne ‘‘Bummie’’ 
Baumgartner, and they were married at Mis-
sion San Juan Bautista on September 12, 
1959. 
Rich entered private practice in 1960, first at 
Chickering & Gregory, and then at Feldman, 
Waldman & Kline, both in San Francisco. 
While in private practice, he began doing pro 
bono legal work and found his passion. In 
1968, San Francisco was chosen as one of 
twenty cities to receive Ford Foundation funds 
directed at increasing the number of lawyers 
involved in pro bono work, and Rich was hired 
as the first Executive Director of the new San 
Francisco Lawyers Committee for Urban Af-
fairs (now Lawyers Committee 
on 
Civil 
Rights). 
Rich’s family was his joy. He was keenly in-
terested in each of his children, grandchildren, 
their spouses and friends. He was a generous, 
funny, original, and supportive father, father-in- 
law, and grandfather, and the best partner to 
Anne. 
Rich was a devout Catholic who believed 
that work on behalf of the marginalized was 
fundamental to being a follower of Jesus. He 
was naturally attracted to quiet prayer and the 
contemplation of God’s goodness in all things 
and people. As Jesuits would say, he was a 
contemplative in action, truly a ‘‘man for oth-
ers.’’ He believed strongly in social justice and 
instilled these principles in his children and 
grandchildren. 
In 1975, Rich became Director of Commu-
nications for the American Bar Association, 
and the family moved to Evanston, Illinois. In 
1998, Rich and Anne began a new adventure 
when they moved to Anne’s family ranch in 
San Juan Bautista, California, where he soon 
became active in the movement for a more 
holistic, regenerative approach to land man-
agement. 
In 2017, Rich and Anne moved back to San 
Francisco, where he was delighted to have a 
window with a view of his beloved Bay. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring this 
great and good man, and in extending our 
most sincere condolences to his beloved wife 
Anne, his eight children; his seven children-in- 
law; his eleven grandchildren and his siblings, 
Nancy Morris, RSJC, Bill Morris, and Thelma 
Clare Morris. Richard Morris’ life was one of 
faith lived, duty, and purpose. He strength-
ened his community and bettered our nation, 
and it is an honor to pay tribute to him.

RECOGNIZING LAURA MONTEVERDI 
FOR HER WORK TO COMBAT THE 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Laura Monteverdi for 
her work to combat the opioid epidemic in Ar-
kansas. 
Laura was recently awarded the National 
Newsmaker Award by the Community Anti- 
Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) for her 
outstanding focus on the opioid crisis in Ar-
kansas. 
The National Newsmaker Award is given to 
a journalist in TV, print or radio, who uses 
their platform to inform the public on sub-
stance use and misuse. 
THV11, the CBS affiliate in Little Rock 
where Laura is an anchor, was awarded an 
Emmy in October for their work on Saving a 
Generation: The New Face of Drug Addiction. 
Laura led the project, which takes a look at 
the drug addiction crisis in Arkansas. She now 
travels the state sharing her personal story 
with youth organizations, local churches and 
schools. 
The opioid crisis is plaguing our Nation and 
hurting too many of our families, and I am 
proud to recognize Laura’s passion and lasting 
commitment to tackling this devastating epi-
demic throughout Arkansas and the country.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF MAYOR 
SUSAN HAMMER 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and work of an extraordinary 
leader, former Mayor Susan Hammer of San 
Jose, California. She was a woman ahead of 
her time, one who championed diversity, the 
arts and the need for paying workers a living 
wage. 
Susan Hammer was born on December 2, 
1938, in Altadena, California. She grew up in 
nearby Monrovia and graduated from UC 
Berkeley, where she met her husband Phil. 
She died on March 7, 2020 at her home in 
Willow Glen, San Jose, with her family by her 
side. 
After working on John F. Kennedy’s presi-
dential campaign, and at the newly formed 
Peace Corps, Susan and Phil returned to his 
hometown of San Jose. She worked on sev-
eral campaigns and served on the San Jose 
City Council from 1983 until she was elected 
Mayor in 1991. She served as the 62nd mayor 
of San Jose from 1991 to 1999, working for di-
versity among city commissions, created the 
Mayor’s Gang Prevention Task Force and 
began a partnership between the City and San 
Jose State University to build the Martin Lu-
ther King Library in downtown San Jose. She 
introduced policies that required the replace-
ment of low-income housing destroyed by re-
development and required city contractors to 
pay their workers living wages. She pushed 
for the construction of the Mexican Heritage 
Plaza and earned the renaming of the San 
Jose Repertory building, the Hammer Theater. 
Susan Hammer served on the Santa Clara 
County Juvenile Justice Commission and was 
a founding member and President of the San 
Jose Museum of Art. She was appointed to 
the Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and 
Negotiations by President Clinton, the first 
woman and the first elected official to serve on 
the Committee. Governor Gray Davis named 
her to the California State Board of Education. 
Mayor Hammer’s son Matt said his mother 
. . . ‘‘was our model of living a life of compas-
sion and devotion to the community.’’ The San 
Jose Mercury (March 10, 2020) in an editorial 
praising her, quoted her farewell address in 
which she said she hoped to be thought of as 
a mayor ‘‘who built community by championing 
the potential of people; who fostered social ac-
tion; and who changed the face of the city by 
nurturing its spirit.’’ ‘‘Mission accomplished’’ is 
the Mercury’s evaluation of her work, and I 
wholeheartedly agree. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the life 
and work of Susan Hammer, a great and good 
woman who set the ‘gold standard’ in public 
service. We express our most sincere condo-
lences to her husband, their three children, 
and all who had the privilege to know her. We 
are a better community and a stronger country 
because of Susan Hammer. I was blessed to 
know her and she will always be a source of 
inspiration to me.

BATTAR 
FOR 
HER 
WORK 
AT 
CAVHS 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Dr. Saraswathy (Sara) 
Battar for her groundbreaking work at the 
Central Arkansas Veterans Health Care Sys-
tem (CAVHS). 
Dr. Battar developed a mnemonic guide, 
called VIONE, to help deprescribe unneeded 
medications. VIONE stands for Vital, Impor-
tant, Optional, Not indicated, and Every medi-
cation has a specific indication for use. 
Launched in 2016, VIONE is an electronic 
tool that uses five filters to assess medications 
and has benefitted more than 77,000 veterans 
at 24 VA facilities. 
To date, over 168,000 prescription orders 
have been discontinued, achieving more than 
$5.8 million in cost avoidance while ensuring 
veterans are only taking the medications they 
need. 
Dr. Battar is a champion for the veterans 
community throughout Arkansas and the coun-
try, and I am proud to recognize her commit-
ment to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

RECOGNIZING CENTRAL ARKANSAS 
WATER’S LEAK DETECTION DOG 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Central Arkansas 
Water’s new tool to detect leaks in its distribu-
tion system—Vessel, the nation’s first water 
leak detection dog. 
A black Labrador mix, Vessel is the first of 
her kind in the United States that can detect 
leaks of treated water. 
She is a rescue dog that graduated from the 
Arkansas Paws in Prison program that gives 
incarcerated inmates the opportunity to train 
rescue dogs and reduce the number of 
unadopted dogs in shelters. 
Vessel is trained to sniff out the chlorine in 
treated water and lay down and bark when 
she finds the leak. Using Vessel’s skills can 
be a more cost-effective and efficient option 
than other leak detection technology. 
Vessel is now an integral part of Central Ar-
kansas 
Water, 
and 
I 
thank 
CEO 
Tad 
Bohannan for his innovation and I look forward 
to seeing Vessel’s good work in our commu-
nities for years to come.
