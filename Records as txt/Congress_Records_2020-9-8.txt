PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of the universe, Father of us all, 
we thank You for giving us another 
day. 
Send Your spirit among Your people, 
that we might be our best selves as 
members of an American community 
dedicated to constitutional norms of 
behavior and process. 
Give us all the needed patience and 
generosity required to continue to ad-
just to the challenges the coronavirus 
presents. Education, small business, 
those who have always had to live pay-
check to paycheck struggle. Help us to 
persevere with all the caution and care 
needed to stop the ongoing spread of 
the virus. 
Bless those who labor to attend to 
the sick, and those who strive to find 
effective 
treatments 
and 
vaccines. 
Bring healing to those who are ill, and 
comfort those who mourn the loss of 
loved ones. Keep us all safe in Your di-
vine mercy. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

S5429 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2020 
No. 154 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our hope for years to 
come, empower our lawmakers to live 
with integrity. Lord, inspire them to 
permit their words to be matched by 
their deeds. As they strive for this eth-
ical congruence, strengthen them to 
examine their hearts with the goal of 
seeking to glorify You. Living by Your 
precepts, may they aspire to be faithful 
to the noble calling of serving You and 
country. 
We pray in Your majestic Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IOWA 99 COUNTY MEETINGS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. In August, I held 49 
county meetings as part of my annual 
99-county set of meetings in Iowa. At 
every meeting, the format is the same: 
Iowans set the agenda. 
Challenges from the pandemic and 
storm recovery were among their top 
concerns. To explain the storm recov-
ery—about once every 10 years there is 
a big wind storm called a derecho going 
across someplace in the country. That 
path was about 150 miles long in Iowa 
and 34 miles wide, and it destroyed the 
crops for this year in that area. Other 
issues came up as well. Biofuels, unem-
ployment insurance, the farm econ-
omy, access to childcare and school re-
openings were frequent points of dis-
cussion. I had the chance of visiting in 
15 different locations with about that 
many school superintendents, and they 
were very optimistic about the coming 
school year. 
This is my 40th year holding my 99 
county meetings. I started this tradi-
tion when I first was elected to the 
Senate, so Iowans in every corner of 
the State would know I care about 
their opinions. 
It is an honor to serve Iowans in the 
U.S. Senate and uphold my end of rep-
resentative government. I look forward 
to more Q&As across the State this 
year and starting my 41st year of 99 
county meetings in 2021. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Our Nation has 
spent the last 6 months fighting the 
medical, economic, and social effects of 
this pandemic. The Senate’s historic 
rescue package from back in March, 
the CARES Act, has gone a long way to 
help American workers and families 
endure these incredible challenges. 
It delivered the extra Federal unem-
ployment benefits that helped laid-off 
workers make ends meet. It created 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program, 
which has helped millions of small 
businesses keep their lights on and 
keep employees on the payroll; it sent 
resources to the frontlines of the 
healthcare fight; and it invested bil-
lions in the race for treatments and for 
vaccines. 
But this relief was never going to 
last forever. Today, enhanced Federal 
unemployment benefits are only still 
available because of action by Presi-
dent Trump. The Paycheck Protection 
Program has closed to new applica-
tions, and the funds it has delivered are 
being exhausted. This last month has 
brought a whole new challenge: how to 
get teachers and students safely into a 
new school year. These are the chal-
lenges that people I represent are fac-
ing every single day. Kentuckians and 
all Americans know this unprecedented 
crisis is not through with us yet, and 
so they expect that Congress isn’t 
through helping yet either. 
Senate Republicans have been fight-
ing for months to deliver another 
round of COVID–19 relief. In July, we 
proposed the HEALS Act, a sweeping 
package totaling more than $1 trillion 
that would have led right to bipartisan 
talks, but Speaker PELOSI
and the 
Democratic leader said no. 
They said they would block our tril-
lion 
dollars 
for 
kids, 
jobs, 
and 
healthcare unless we doubled the cost 
to accommodate an endless wish list of 
non-COVID-related 
liberal 
priorities 
such as tax cuts for blue-State million-
aires. 
So Republicans tried another way to 
break the logjam. In August, we pro-
posed narrowing discussions to some of 
the most urgent, most bipartisan sub-
jects that seemed especially ripe for 
agreement, but Speaker PELOSI and the 
Democratic leader blocked that as 
well. Now they claimed it was too 
‘‘piecemeal’’—too 
piecemeal, 
they 
said—to get any help out the door until 
Democrats and Republicans had settled 
every disagreement on every front. 
The Democratic leaders have spent 
months playing these ‘‘Goldilocks’’ 
games. They have complained about 
every single thing we put forward but 
produced nothing of their own with any 
chance whatsoever of becoming law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5430 
September 8, 2020 
Meanwhile, after all their blustering 
that Congress should never do any-
thing ‘‘piecemeal,’’ Speaker PELOSI 
came rushing back to Washington to 
pass the most piecemeal bill you could 
possibly imagine—legislation that sole-
ly helped out the U.S. Postal Service 
and did nothing at all for American 
families. When Republicans tried to 
help American workers keep their jobs, 
Speaker PELOSI and Leader SCHUMER 
said it was ‘‘piecemeal,’’ but when 
House Democrats’ fears about mail-in 
voting made them think maybe their 
own jobs would be in jeopardy, that ar-
gument suddenly disappeared. 
That is the score. Democrats are all 
for piecemeal bills when they concern 
their own reelections, but when it 
comes to bipartisan aid for kids, jobs, 
and schools, Democrats say it is either 
their entire wish list—all of it—or no-
body gets a dime. 
Well, Republicans see this quite dif-
ferently. We don’t think this crisis 
cares about partisan politics. We think 
people are hurting and Congress should 
do its job. We want to agree where a bi-
partisan agreement is possible, get 
more help out the door, and then keep 
arguing over the rest later. 
That is how you legislate. That is 
how you make law. You find agreement 
where agreement is possible and keep 
arguing over the rest later. 
So Republicans are making yet an-
other overture. Today, we are releasing 
a targeted proposal that focuses on sev-
eral of the most urgent aspects of this 
crisis—issues 
where 
bipartisanship 
should be especially possible. I am 
talking about policies such as extend-
ing the additional Federal unemploy-
ment benefit for jobless workers; pro-
viding a second round of the job-saving 
Paycheck Protection Program for the 
hardest hit small businesses to prevent 
layoffs; sending more than $100 billion 
to help K–12 schools and universities 
open safely and educate our kids; dedi-
cating billions more for testing, con-
tact tracing, treatments, and vaccines; 
on-shoring manufacturing capacity for 
critical medical supplies and rebuilding 
our national stockpile; giving all kinds 
of families more choice and flexibility 
to navigate education and childcare 
during the crisis; providing legal pro-
tections for schools, churches, char-
ities, nonprofits, and employers so they 
can reopen; providing more help for the 
Postal Service. Our proposal would do 
all this and more. 
Now, here is what our bill is not. It is 
not a sweeping, multitrillion-dollar 
plan to rebuild the entire country in 
Republicans’ image. It does not even 
contain every single relief policy that 
Republicans ourselves think would help 
in the short term. I am confident the 
Democrats would feel the same way. 
But the American people don’t need 
us to keep arguing over what might be 
perfect. They need us to actually make 
law. 
So Democratic leaders are perfectly 
free to come out here and keep up their 
playbook from these past months. Just 
blast away—blast away—in bad faith, 
call names, and complain about the in-
finite number of things this proposal 
does not do. Maybe they will bring 
back their ‘‘Goldilocks’’ act and say 
our 
multihundred-billion-dollar 
pro-
posal is too small or too skinny, even 
though Democrats just passed a piece-
meal bill for the Postal Service that ig-
nored everything else—a piecemeal bill 
for the Postal Service that ignored ev-
erything else. 
Democrats can do all that if they 
want to. I understand they have al-
ready been criticizing this bill today 
before they even read it, before it had 
even been put out. More of this would 
just reinforce that only one side of the 
aisle seems to want any bipartisan out-
come at all. 
It is easy to tell in Washington 
whether somebody’s end goal is polit-
ical posturing or getting an outcome. 
One way or another, what Democrats 
do will be revealing. 
The Senate is going to vote on this 
targeted proposal. We are going to get 
the stonewalling of Democratic leaders 
out from behind closed doors and put 
this to a vote out here on the floor. It 
is going to happen this week. Senators 
will not be voting on whether this tar-
geted package satisfies every one of 
their legislative hopes and dreams. 
That is not what we will do in this 
Chamber. We vote on whether to make 
laws, whether to forge a compromise, 
whether to do a lot of good for the 
country and keep arguing over the re-
maining differences later. 
A few weeks ago, more than 100 
House Democrats spoke out publicly. 
They asked Speaker PELOSI
to stop 
stonewalling and let the House vote on 
targeted COVID relief short of—short 
of—her entire wish list. The Speaker 
ignored them—ignored her rank and 
file, just like her piecemeal postal bill 
ignored American families. 
Over here I will make sure our Demo-
cratic colleagues get a chance to walk 
the walk. Every Senator who has said 
they want a bipartisan outcome for the 
country will have a chance to vote for 
everyone to see. Senators will vote this 
week, and the American people will be 
watching. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I understand there are three bills at 
the desk due for a second reading en 
bloc. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bills by title for the 
second time. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3) to establish a fair price ne-
gotiation program, protect the Medicare pro-
gram from excessive price increases, and es-
tablish an out-of-pocket maximum for Medi-
care part D enrollees, and for other purposes. 
A bill (H.R. 51) to provide for the admission 
of the State of Washington, D.C. into the 
Union. 
A bill (H.R. 1425) to amend the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act to pro-
vide for a Improve Health Insurance Afford-
ability Fund to provide for certain reinsur-
ance payments to lower premiums in the in-
dividual health insurance market. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bills on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I object to further 
proceedings en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar on the next leg-
islative day en bloc. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read nomina-
tion of Brett H. Ludwig, of Wisconsin, 
to be United States District Judge for 
the Eastern District of Wisconsin. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as we 
all know, we are in the middle of a pub-
lic health crisis. The American people 
are hurting, from every State in our 
country. Nearly 190,000 people—our fel-
low citizens—have died. Millions have 
lost their jobs, and they are struggling 
to make ends meet. People are being 
evicted from their homes, and they are 
struggling to feed their families. 
The virus is still not under control. 
We know there is a need for another 
emergency funding bill. The need to 
address the COVID crisis is clear. This 
is something, actually, we could have 
done in July if we had been willing to 
actually do our job and vote on the ap-
propriations bills after the House of 
Representatives had already shown the 
way, but 4 weeks ago, the Trump ad-
ministration and the Senate Repub-
lican leadership walked away from the 
negotiating table. Democrats had of-
fered a compromise. Republicans said 
‘‘My way or the highway’’ and left 
town. They just walked away from the 
Capitol when we had all these things 
that needed to be done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5431 
September 8, 2020 
Here we are. We are back 4 weeks 
later. Is the situation better? Of course 
not. Across the country, families are 
sending their children back to school 
without the necessary resources to en-
sure they are safe, and still more stu-
dents are learning from home but often 
without reliable access to the internet. 
Evictions 
are 
rising. 
Families 
are 
struggling to find childcare. Unemploy-
ment is at the highest level I can re-
member—certainly unacceptable lev-
els. States are preparing for Novem-
ber’s elections without the resources 
they need to make sure people can 
safely vote. The Postal Service needs a 
serious injection of funding to deliver 
mail in a timely manner. It actually 
has consequences. 
I am for the right to negotiate. I was 
4 weeks ago. I have been throughout 
the time the Senate has been out of 
session. I have been prepared to come 
back and negotiate. But now we find 
that, no, Republican leadership will 
not negotiate. 
Senator MCCONNELL says he has pre-
pared a so-called skinny COVID bill to 
put before the Senate. He will put it 
before 
us 
on 
a 
take-it-or-leave-it 
basis—no amendments, no debate. This 
proposal is not skinny; it is anemic. 
Why are they afraid to vote? Let’s 
have amendments and vote them up or 
down. Is there any question as to why 
the American public wonders what is 
going on when the Republican leader-
ship will not even allow a vote? What 
are they so afraid of? It is democracy. 
Vote up or down. The Republicans have 
a majority. If they don’t like the 
amendments that come up, vote them 
down, but at least vote on them. Don’t 
hide behind platitudes, tweets, and 
campaign ads, which you can do be-
cause you never actually have to take 
responsibility. You ought to vote. 
The bill hasn’t been made public, but 
details are beginning to emerge. The 
details that have emerged show it is 
woefully inadequate to meet the needs 
of the country. In fact, it provides even 
less relief than the smaller, trillion- 
dollar package the Trump administra-
tion put forward before the Senate ad-
journed a month ago. 
I don’t know where Republicans 
spent the last month, but I know where 
I was. I was all over the State of 
Vermont 
talking 
to 
Republicans, 
Democrats, and Independents, hearing 
what is on people’s minds—not lobby-
ists, not special interests, but the peo-
ple who have to pay the bills and who 
have to pay the consequences. I became 
even more convinced, not less, that we 
have dire needs in this country because 
of the coronavirus pandemic, and we 
have to address them, and soon. How 
any Senator went back to his or her 
home State and returned convinced 
that even less assistance is needed than 
when we left last month is baffling to 
me. That is why I am saying that every 
Senator can say where they stand, but 
the way they prove where they stand is 
to vote. 
Let’s have the courage to stand up 
and vote yes or no, not a take-it-or- 
leave-it package that will be decided 
by one person, and nobody else would 
be able to vote anything differently. 
What are we? What are we—a bunch of 
ducks in a row, or are we U.S. Sen-
ators? 
Adding insult to injury, we now find 
that 
the 
bill 
ultimately 
provides 
sweeping liability shields for corporate 
bad actors who fail to do their part to 
keep consumers, employees, and pa-
tients safe. It tells you everything you 
need to know about the priorities of 
this Republican package—big corpora-
tions come ahead of struggling Amer-
ican families. 
Instead of the person who is trying to 
pay the bills and send their children 
back to school, who is making out in 
this bill? The lobbyists for multibil-
lion-dollar insurance companies. They 
are already making billions of dollars. 
They don’t have to worry about paying 
the bills. They don’t have to worry 
about their children going back to 
school. They don’t have to worry about 
jobs. And this bill gives them one more 
gift? How can we possibly say we sup-
port that and then go back home and 
say we are on the side of our people? 
If the majority leader wants to put 
this so-called skinny bill—including a 
giveaway to the multibillion-dollar in-
surance companies—well, do it the 
right way. Bring it here. Set up a real 
debate on the bill—debate that the 
country deserves and that I think a 
majority of the Republicans and Demo-
crats would want. Open it to amend-
ment—no 
limits. 
Let 
the 
process 
work—not a process that only rewards 
highly paid lobbyists for multibillion- 
dollar corporations, but allow Senators 
on both sides of the aisle to say: Here 
is where I stand with the people in my 
State who have to pay the bills, who 
have to send their kids back to school, 
who are trying to keep their jobs or 
keep their farms going, or whatever it 
might be. 
Let Members raise issues important 
to their constituents from any of the 50 
States, and then vote on those issues: 
funding for State and local govern-
ments that are facing the brunt of the 
COVID response; money for schools so 
we can safely educate our Nation’s 
children; rental assistance and eviction 
protections to help keep people in their 
homes; food assistance for hungry fam-
ilies so they don’t go hungry in the 
wealthiest Nation on Earth; funding 
for our elections so we can ensure that 
people can safely vote and we can trust 
the results of the vote; big investments 
in testing and contact tracing because 
we know we can’t begin to do the 
amount of testing and contact tracing 
we need to do today. 
Our economy is only going to come 
back when the American people are 
confident the virus is no longer a 
threat. I know the President said last 
winter that of course the virus will go 
away in the spring. Everybody in this 
Chamber, Republican and Democrat, 
knows he wasn’t telling the truth on 
that. Of course it didn’t go away. 
We are not going to have a recovery 
until we have confidence that the virus 
is no longer a threat. My friend Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s skinny bill doesn’t 
provide that confidence. 
So I say put these issues up for a 
vote. Take each one of these issues and 
vote it up or down. Let the American 
people see where each Member of this 
Chamber stands. I know where I stand. 
Do as Republican leaders in the past 
have done. Howard Baker, Bob Dole, 
and others are the great leaders. To my 
knowledge, with some of the amend-
ments, they would say: OK, we will 
vote them up or we will vote them 
down. Why don’t we do that? That is 
the way the Senate was designed. But 
this majority leader will not do what 
his predecessors have done. Why? Be-
cause on many of these issues, he 
knows he would lose. Not too many 
would be willing to vote for his give-
away to the lobbyists for the large in-
surance companies. 
A vote simply to move to this bill is 
just for show. It doesn’t provide us an 
opportunity for real debate. It doesn’t 
solve the problems facing the country. 
Show votes do nothing to combat the 
virus or give the American people the 
confidence to reopen the economy. In 
fact, I suggest just the opposite. The 
American people, seeing us doing just 
political showboating votes here, are 
going to have even less confidence that 
things will come back. 
Absent a real debate in the Senate, 
which clearly the other side of the aisle 
is afraid of, Republicans have to come 
back to the negotiating table. Restart 
bipartisan and bicameral talks on a 
comprehensive COVID relief package 
that can pass both Chambers. 
I hear Senators say, well, we can’t 
vote on this or we can’t vote on that 
because it might not be popular at 
home. My response in a case like that 
is, why do you want to be here? 
We have had nearly 2,000 Senators in 
this country. The Senator who voted 
the most in the Nation’s history was 
Senator Bob Byrd, one of the longest 
serving Senators. He voted around 
18,000 times. He was willing to stand 
for his vote. Out of those 2,000 Sen-
ators, the Senator who comes in second 
with the most votes is this Senator 
from Vermont. That is not just for lon-
gevity; that means I voted for things 
that I knew would hurt me politically, 
but I thought it was the right thing to 
do. I was willing to state to the people 
of Vermont: Here is where I stand. You 
can agree or disagree with me, but you 
know where I stand. 
One of the reasons the Senate is held 
in such disfavor in this country is that 
we don’t vote. We don’t have real de-
bate. It is all one way or that way 
alone. 
Absent a real debate in the Senate, 
which clearly the Republican leader is 
afraid of, why don’t the Republicans 
come back to the negotiating table and 
restart bipartisan, bicameral talks on a 
comprehensive COVID relief package 
that can pass both Chambers?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5432 
September 8, 2020 
We actually were prepared to do this 
in July. I remember saying: Why don’t 
we bring up all the appropriations 
bills? The Republicans have the major-
ity. They can vote them down if they 
don’t like them, but let’s bring them 
up and have a vote on them, one way or 
the other. No, we couldn’t do it. 
Now Senator MCCONNELL
says he 
wants to do this process piecemeal: 
Pass a little bit now, a little bit later. 
Trust me, we can do that. 
Well, as Ronald Reagan would say, 
‘‘Trust, but verify.’’ Let’s have a real 
vote. Let’s vote on all of it because we 
know that the majority leader will ad-
journ the Senate later this month to go 
home and campaign. It appears all he 
wants is a show vote on a woefully in-
adequate bill that he knows can never 
become law and then to get out of here. 
That is not a plan for action. That is 
not a real plan to pass a bill for the 
American people. It is unacceptable. 
Why don’t we admit that the most 
important thing before us is what is 
happening with COVID and how we ad-
dress it? Now, I know a lot of Repub-
licans who have some very good ideas, 
and I know a lot of Democrats who 
have some very good ideas to address 
it. Let’s bring them up. Let’s vote on 
them—vote for them or vote against 
them. 
Don’t say we are not going to allow a 
vote because we don’t have time. We 
have plenty of time. We have plenty of 
time. Let’s just stay here every day, go 
through weekends if need be, and just 
vote, vote up or down. 
We are running out of time. Right 
now, the majority leader intends to ad-
journ the Senate in just a few weeks. 
Well, the American people don’t have 
that luxury. They can’t just go home 
for a few weeks knowing their bills are 
being paid, their salary is being paid. 
They need our help. Why don’t we do 
our job and vote these things up or 
down? 
Have the courage to say what you 
stand for. We could have, easily, 40 to 
50 amendments—realistic amendments 
from both Republicans and Demo-
crats—vote them up or down, and then 
have a bill that can go to conference. 
Every one of us knows we should have 
done that in July. We didn’t. We could 
have done that in August. We didn’t. 
It is September. Let’s at least now do 
our job, uphold our oath of office, and 
pass the bill. Let’s not be afraid of how 
we vote. I know, in my own votes, 
those 16,000-plus, somebody can find 
votes they disagree with. So what. I 
have the courage to vote. 
I call on my fellow Senators: Have 
the courage to vote. We are supposed to 
be the conscience of the Nation. Let’s 
try to be. I see other Senators on the 
floor, eagerly awaiting their chance to 
give us their news. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
take to the floor of the Senate this 
afternoon to call Senators’ attention 
to the worsening crisis in intercountry 
adoptions. I must say, it saddens me to 
have to do this because much of the 
crisis in foreign adoptions—or inter-
country adoptions—is happening as a 
result of policies of our own Federal 
Government. 
I am fortunate to have had two lov-
ing parents and a loving family. My 
dad is 96 years old. I visited with him 
yesterday. My mom, sadly, passed 
away several years ago. But I was for-
tunate. I was among the fortunate peo-
ple on the face of this planet to have 
two loving parents and a loving family. 
That is not the case all around the 
world. 
Internationally, in particular, there 
are countless children who have no 
mom, no dad, no family, no extended 
family to care for them. They reside in 
the most deplorable conditions, in or-
phanages, and as wards of the state. 
Americans have always been compas-
sionate for these children without a 
forever family, and that compassion 
extends to children not only orphaned 
in the United States but also outside of 
our borders. For decades, Americans 
have led the world in welcoming chil-
dren from around the globe to come to 
the United States and be part of a for-
ever family. As a result, more than 
150,000 children adopted from foreign 
countries are now growing up in the 
United States—150,000. These children 
and their adoptive families are exam-
ples of America at its best. 
I am here to say to my colleagues 
today that intercountry adoption is in 
real trouble, and much of the reason 
that intercountry adoption is in trou-
ble is coming from our own Federal 
policies, from unelected bureaucrats, 
particularly at our own Department of 
State. 
The number of international children 
finding an American home has plum-
meted in recent years. Listen to this 
statistic. In the year 2004, Americans 
adopted 23,000 children from foreign 
countries—23,000. Last year, 2019, that 
number had fallen below 3,000, an 87- 
percent drop from 23,000 only 15 years 
before to 3,000 in 15 short years. 
Now, people who have been looking 
into this issue are well aware of what 
is causing the decline, and one of the 
reasons is Russia. Because of foreign 
policy disagreements, Russia has shut 
its doors to intercountry adoption. We 
have pleaded with the Russian Govern-
ment about this, and we have not made 
much progress. That is one of the fac-
tors—not the only factor and not even 
the principal factor, but that is on the 
Russian Government. It saddens me 
that they have done that. 
The biggest reason for the decline in 
intercountry adoptions by Americans 
comes within our own government, our 
own State Department. For years, the 
State Department and its adoption ac-
crediting entity have demonstrated a 
clear and consistent bias against inter-
country adoption. It saddens me to say 
this. It is unbelievable that I have to 
say this, but career bureaucrats in the 
State Department have deliberately 
obstructed the adoption process with 
new 
fees, 
new 
requirements 
that 
amount to redtape, and unrealistic 
standards 
on 
foreign 
governments. 
These bureaucrats have placed burden-
some regulations on adoption provider 
agencies. These regulations make it 
nearly impossible for adoption-pro-
viding agencies to maintain accredita-
tion. 
This has been done by design, and the 
results are devastating. In the last 
year and a half, more than 30 adoption- 
providing agencies have left the inter-
country adoption space, and we are los-
ing more agencies every month. The 
bias of our Federal Government’s State 
Department against intercountry adop-
tions is unmistakable. 
In 2018, for example, the Department 
directly intervened to prevent three 
well-respected adoption agencies from 
being reaccredited. A Federal judge 
dismissed the Department’s reasoning 
as ‘‘quite unconvincing’’ and ‘‘simply 
illogical.’’ That is what a Federal judge 
had to say about the reasoning of this 
little part of the State Department 
that seems determined to end foreign 
adoptions. 
During that same year, 2018, a jour-
nalist quoted a State Department in-
sider who confirmed that the Office of 
Children’s Issues, the OCI, in the State 
Department is biased against inter-
country adoption. Why they would 
take this position is beyond me. Adop-
tion advocates followed up by request-
ing Freedom of Information Act docu-
ments about this claim by the jour-
nalist who quoted the State Depart-
ment insider, but the Department of 
State has resisted this Freedom of In-
formation Act request and has still yet 
to produce any documents 2 years after 
the 
statutory 
FOIA 
deadline 
has 
passed. 
There are plenty more examples. 
Last 
year, 
the 
State 
Department 
hosted an adoption symposium that 
may as well have been called the inter-
national 
anti-adoption 
symposium. 
This is funded at our State Department 
by our own taxpayer dollars. Our own 
tax funds funded a conference that fea-
tured radically anti-adoption speakers 
who openly denounced the practice of 
international adoptions. It is hard to 
believe, and it is hard to imagine a 
worse use of taxpayer dollars. 
The adoption community has voiced 
concerns about the State Department’s 
anti-adoption bias, but it seems that 
government has not listened. I will say 
that this has been a problem in State 
Departments headed by Republican 
Secretaries and by Democratic Secre-
taries. When adoption providers pri-
vately shared their concerns about the 
accrediting agency, the Department re-
sponded by issuing a public letter 
threatening the future of intercountry 
adoption. 
The Office of Children’s Issues, OCI, 
is slamming the door in the faces of 
thousands of orphans who need a fam-
ily, and they are saying no to willing

American couples who are pleading to 
give these international children a for-
ever family here in our great country. 
It seems that OCI’s priorities are out 
of step with their statutory mandate. 
Also, they are out of step with the val-
ues of this country and basic morality. 
We need to change the policy of the 
State Department in this regard, I say 
to my colleagues. 
I call on my colleagues on the For-
eign Relations Committee to hold an 
oversight hearing to review the State 
Department’s 
role 
in 
intercountry 
adoption, to examine the allegations of 
bias against intercountry adoption, 
and to hear from accrediting agencies 
and other stakeholders about their ex-
periences in working with the Depart-
ment of State and its accrediting enti-
ty. I think such a hearing would be re-
vealing, and I think the results would 
be troubling to Members of the Con-
gress. 
I also call on the Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations to in-
vestigate allegations raised against the 
U.S. accrediting entity in the State De-
partment’s Office of Children’s Issues. 
It is time, actually, to transition the 
U.S. central authority from the De-
partment of State to a more receptive, 
more compassionate, and more under-
standing home, such as the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
This would allow experienced child 
welfare professionals to oversee inter-
country adoptions. 
We have a great Secretary of State. I 
have known Mike Pompeo for years. I 
think he has got all he can preside 
over, and I don’t for a minute think 
that the Secretary of State under-
stands what this small entity in his 
State Department is doing. I think he 
must have no idea that this is going 
on, but I think the solution is to move 
this function from the State Depart-
ment. 
I would call on the Secretary of State 
to put a hold on planned changes down 
in this little agency populated by 
unelected bureaucrats who are hostile 
to adoption. I think we should put a 
hold on planned changes in the accredi-
tation compliance system until there 
has been a full review of OCI’s bias 
against adoption. The competence of 
their staff needs to be investigated, and 
we need to look, we need to give an 
open assessment, shining the light of 
day on the impact that this small 
group of bureaucrats is having on 
something that I think most Ameri-
cans support. 
The American people believe in adop-
tion. They believe in giving orphans 
anywhere in the world an opportunity 
to have a forever family. They believe 
in giving couples here in the United 
States the opportunity to provide a 
home for these children who are less 
fortunate than most of us have been, 
most of us within the sound of my 
voice have been. I think the American 
people believe in a change in this 
inexplicably anti-American and anti- 
family policy. 
Today, I am on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate to shine a light on this tragedy, 
on this outrage. I ask my colleagues to 
remember the teaching of the Psalm-
ist: ‘‘Give justice to the weak and the 
fatherless; maintain the right of the af-
flicted and the destitute.’’ 
I think Americans believe in the sen-
timents of the Psalmist in that regard. 
I think we are ready to heed the plight 
of the fatherless. Let’s not neglect our 
duty in correcting the situation we 
find ourselves in and, once again, be-
coming the country that provides wel-
coming, loving outreach to children to 
be part of a forever American family.

TEXAS 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
each year, during the month of August, 
I look forward to traveling across my 
State—my very big State—to spend 
time with my constituents. It is the 
best way to learn firsthand how the 
laws and programs we enact here are 
working and to receive the feedback on 
legislation being considered by the 
Congress in the future and what I can 
do to better help the folks back home. 
A typical State work period involves 
dozens of face-to-face events from 
every corner of my State, covering all 
ages, professions, and walks of life. 
Last August, I spent time talking with 
my constituents about everything from 
the Debbie Smith Act and GI benefits 
for student veterans to Project Safe 
Neighborhoods grants and the U.S.- 
Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. 
As we all know, 2020 has been any-
thing but typical, and this August was 
no exception. These big, in-person 
events have been replaced with virtual 
ones, with face-to-face meetings, which 
now involve wearing masks, social 
distancing, and a heavy dose of hand 
sanitizer. Instead of the broad range of 
policies we might normally discuss, al-
most every one of them centered on the 
impact of COVID–19. No big surprise 
there. 
I have heard from mayors, teachers, 
food bank employees, healthcare work-
ers, restaurant owners, energy workers,

S5434 
September 8, 2020 
and countless others about how the re-
sources that we have been providing 
them have helped them through this 
pandemic. From the Rio Grande Valley 
to 
Amarillo—opposite 
ends 
of 
our 
State—from Tyler to Orange in the 
eastern part of the State and all points 
in between, I masked up and met with 
Texans who are working overtime to 
keep their communities safe and to 
provide for their families. All the 
while, I continue to hold virtual con-
versations and telephone townhalls to 
hear from my constituents and share 
information about what we are doing 
to be helpful to them. 
These conversations, as I said a mo-
ment ago, always help me better under-
stand the effectiveness of the legisla-
tion we passed and provide valuable 
feedback about what is needed in the 
next coronavirus relief bill. 
With the school year now officially 
underway in most of Texas, additional 
support for our students and teachers 
is one of my top priorities. I have had 
the chance to speak with K–12 students 
and teachers in Odessa, Lubbock, and 
Canyon, and college students and ad-
ministrators in Angelo State Univer-
sity in San Angelo, as well as Texas 
Tech University and Texas Tech Health 
Science Center in Amarillo. Some 
joined us socially distanced on campus 
and others connected virtually. 
I was able to hear from both students 
and teachers about this unprecedented 
school year and the challenges—the 
extra 
challenges—brought 
on 
by 
COVID–19. Whether in person, online, 
or some combination of the two, edu-
cation looks a lot different this year, 
and we need to provide schools with 
the funding to keep kids in the class-
rooms safe and those at home on track 
for a great education. 
Congress has already passed $30 bil-
lion in emergency relief for education, 
including more than $2.6 billion for 
Texas. This funding has helped our 
school districts, colleges, and univer-
sities prepare for the fall, but, to be 
honest, more is needed. 
For those learning in person, addi-
tional funding can cover cleaning serv-
ices and equipment to prevent children 
from catching and spreading the virus. 
For those learning virtually, it could 
provide additional hardware and inter-
net hotspots so they can do their stud-
ies online. 
I visited one high school in Ector 
County—that is Odessa, TX—where 
they are using a blended or hybrid in- 
person and online instruction model. 
Ector County ISD began this year with 
online instruction for students who 
have internet access at home and in- 
person instruction for those who did 
not. Of the roughly 33,000 students in 
the district, about 4,200 were in the 
classroom on the first day. And I can 
assure you, it is not the only school 
district in Texas whose students have 
difficulty 
accessing 
the 
technology 
needed to learn from home. 
More than 2 million Texas house-
holds don’t have reliable internet ac-
cess, and it is leaving our students on 
the wrong side of the digital divide. 
Internet access is no longer a luxury or 
just a convenience; it has become a ne-
cessity, and we need to do more to en-
sure that students across Texas and 
across the Nation have access to reli-
able broadband. 
The CARES Act, which we passed in 
March, provides some relief on this 
front. It gave libraries $50 million in 
grants for digital connection. The de-
mand for these funds was much higher 
than was available, and it became obvi-
ous we need to do more to help those 
who are on the wrong side of the dig-
ital divide. 
The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. 
MANCHIN, and I teamed up to include 
and introduce the ACCESS the Inter-
net Act, which will provide funding to 
both the Department of Education and 
libraries to make reliable internet a re-
ality. 
In addition to supporting virtual 
learning, this would also make access 
to telehealth more available to fami-
lies. This has really been one of the 
most surprising positive developments 
out of this pandemic, and that is actu-
ally 
greater 
access 
to 
healthcare 
through telehealth, both physical and 
Mental Health Services on online. 
Our 
bill 
includes 
funding 
for 
healthcare providers, including the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, to get 
more patients connected so they can 
utilize these telehealth services. As we 
make a push for progress on the next 
relief bill, I will continue fighting for 
resources for our students and teach-
ers, and that includes reliable access to 
the internet. 
Despite this August work period 
looking much different from years 
prior, I was still able to connect with 
tens of thousands of Texans virtually 
and over the phone and safely meet 
many of them in person. As I traveled, 
I was able to see how schools, our 
healthcare facilities, our food banks, 
local governments, and more have been 
able to use the Federal coronavirus 
funding provided for in the CARES Act. 
The feedback and insight I received 
was invaluable to my work in the Sen-
ate, and it is more important than ever 
as we continue negotiations on the 
next coronavirus relief bill. 
This is going to be a busy month in 
the Senate. We need to pass legislation 
to bolster our response to this virus, 
support our students and teachers, help 
those in need of financial assistance, 
and ensure that our healthcare re-
sponse remains robust. 
We are just 3 weeks away from the 
end of the fiscal year, including a gov-
ernment shutdown unless we can reach 
an agreement on a funding bill. Com-
plicating matters even further, we are 
at the peak of hurricane season, which 
may not seem like as big a deal in DC, 
but I guarantee, we have our eyes on 
these tropical storms in the Gulf of 
Mexico that could well end up onshore. 
Hurricane Hanna, for example, struck 
South Texas in July and hit our farm-
ers and producers hard, as well as 
flooding out many, many homes and 
displacing families. A couple of weeks 
ago, Hurricane Laura tore through the 
Gulf of Mexico. 
Though the brunt of Laura hit other 
neighbors in Louisiana, for which we 
are very sorry, we are very glad that it 
did little damage in Southeast Texas, 
but it still did some significant dam-
age. I was able to join the Governor, 
Lieutenant 
Governor, 
and 
Senator 
CRUZ for a visit to Orange to survey 
the damage and speak with local offi-
cials about the impact of the storm. I 
am committed to providing my con-
stituents in Texas with the resources 
needed to recover from whatever this 
hurricane season may bring. I will be 
keeping a close eye on the weather 
forecast as we move through what has 
already been an active hurricane sea-
son. 
We have a lot of work to do in the 
next few weeks. Though we weren’t 
able to make progress on a coronavirus 
bill in July, I was on almost virtually 
daily conference calls with the White 
House and Secretary Mnuchin talking 
about the way forward. I am more opti-
mistic today than I have been to this 
point that we will, ultimately, reach 
an agreement. I hope my colleagues 
have also heard from their constituents 
about how important relief is and that 
we can come together at such a critical 
point in our fight against COVID–19. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
the 3 weeks since the Senate last met, 
America eclipsed 6 million confirmed 
cases 
of 
COVID–19. 
Nearly 
190,000 
Americans have died, and those totals 
climb by tragic amounts each day. Too 
many businesses remain closed, schools 
begin the year under a dark cloud of 
uncertainty, and our economy faces 
the greatest crisis since the Great De-
pression. 
The United States is 11.5 million jobs 
short of where we were at the start of 
February, and the number of jobs that 
have been permanently lost is rising at 
an alarming rate. All of this reflects a 
tragic reality: President Trump has led 
the worst response to COVID–19 of any 
nation on Earth. It is what it is. 
The economic pain of the pandemic 
was mitigated by our action in March 
when Democrats insisted on a robust 
stimulus bill that became the CARES 
Act. One of our policies included in 
that bill, enhanced unemployment ben-
efits, has kept nearly 12 million Ameri-
cans from poverty. Those benefits have

now mostly expired, and the stimulus 
provided by the CARES Act has been 
exhausted. The pandemic and economic 
hardship for millions of American 
workers and families, however, is ongo-
ing and painful. 
Speaker PELOSI and I have been try-
ing to negotiate with the White House 
in another round of relief. It has been 
arduous. Democrats offered to meet 
our Republican colleagues in the mid-
dle, but the White House has refused to 
make any significant compromise. 
Here in the Senate, the Republican 
majority leader has kept the Senate on 
‘‘pause’’ while the Nation suffered. 
When they tried to draft a relief pack-
age in July, Senate Republicans flailed 
for 2 weeks before announcing a series 
of separate, incoherent proposals that 
lacked the support of—surprise—Sen-
ate Republicans. It was so unpopular 
within the Republican conference that 
Leader MCCONNELL never even brought 
it up for a vote. 
Now, after more than 4 months of 
long inaction—after sitting on the side-
lines while we tried to negotiate with a 
recalcitrant White House—Senate Re-
publicans are finally realizing the dam-
age their pause—the McConnell pause— 
has done to the American economy and 
our Nation’s health. As they scramble 
to make up for this historic mistake, 
Senate Republicans appear dead set on 
another bill that doesn’t come close to 
addressing the problems in our coun-
try. 
The Republicans are going to cut 
their original, inadequate $1 trillion 
‘‘skinny’’ bill in half—maybe more— 
and put it up for a vote this week. Of 
course, it had no input—zero input— 
from the Democrats—completely par-
tisan. In this Chamber, you need bipar-
tisanship to get anything done. The 
Republicans call this a ‘‘skinny’’—or 
‘‘targeted’’—proposal, but it would be 
more appropriate to call it ‘‘emaci-
ated.’’ Shockingly, as the pain from 
this pandemic gets bigger and bigger, 
the Republicans think smaller and 
smaller. They are moving backward. 
Their proposal is completely inad-
equate and, by every measure, fails to 
meet the needs of the American peo-
ple—with no money for rental assist-
ance, nutrition assistance, the census, 
safe elections, and so many other 
things. 
The bill, amazingly, will do almost 
nothing to help State and local govern-
ments that have already been forced to 
cut a million jobs since the pandemic 
began. This bill actually goes backward 
from the last Republican proposal. It 
does not even allow States to use exist-
ing relief funds to cover lost revenues. 
Even worse, this latest and sorriest 
Republican proposal is laden with poi-
son pills that our colleagues know the 
Democrats would never support. The 
bill doesn’t provide enough funding to 
help our schools reopen safely—not 
close to what school superintendents 
say they need—but it includes funding 
for a partisan school choice program 
that has been long pushed by hard- 
right 
conservatives 
and 
Secretary 
DeVos. It provides immunity to cor-
porations that put their workers in 
harm’s way, which, sadly, seems to be 
the only thing that the Republicans 
can consistently agree on. It even in-
cludes a provision that could fast-track 
coal mining operations because, God 
forbid, our Republican friends miss an 
opportunity to reward corporate pol-
luters in their coronavirus relief bill. 
The Republicans call their bill ‘‘tar-
geted.’’ Maybe they mean it is targeted 
to corporate donors. The presence of 
these poison pills should remove every 
shred of doubt that the true intent of 
this bill is anything but political. If 
Leader MCCONNELL and the Republican 
majority were trying to achieve a re-
sult, they wouldn’t draft such a lame, 
partisan bill, loaded with poison pills, 
and rush it to the floor. 
May we have order, please? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Yes, sir. 
Mr. Leader, be careful not to impugn 
the motives of another. The leader sug-
gested corporate donors. I issue that 
warning. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The truth is, if you 
wanted to draft a bill that was certain 
to fail, this is it. This is one of the 
most cynical moves I have ever seen. 
We all know what is going on here. 
Leader MCCONNELL had to create the 
most paltry, partisan, cynical bill be-
cause he has 20 Members of his caucus 
who don’t want to support anything. 
By his own admission, they want zero 
dollars, so Leader MCCONNELL keeps 
whittling down the Republican pro-
posal until he can find something— 
anything—that he can claim his party 
supports. He had to throw in the right 
wing’s favorite goodies to sweeten the 
pot to even approach the number of 
votes in his caucus to make it look like 
a Republican bill that had broad sup-
port. 
Leader MCCONNELL knows this bill 
won’t pass, and he knows that most of 
his Members don’t want it to pass. 
Amazingly, he seems happy with that 
situation. This is one of the most cyn-
ical moves I have ever seen in the mid-
dle of a pandemic—when Americans are 
crying out for relief. 
This political exercise on the Repub-
lican side bears no relationship to the 
needs of our country. It has nothing to 
do with our States, our workers, our 
families, with opening up schools safe-
ly, or with what healthcare workers 
really need. It has everything to do 
with finding the bare minimum that 
Senate Republicans can support. While 
facing the greatest economic crisis in 
75 years and the greatest health crisis 
in a century, Leader MCCONNELL isn’t 
searching for bipartisan progress; he is 
looking for political cover. 
As we begin the final work period be-
fore 
the 
November 
elections, 
the 
Democrats will keep pushing for a bi-
partisan, bicameral agreement that ac-
tually meets the urgent needs of the 
American people. For the good of the 
country, I hope—I pray—my Repub-
lican colleagues will join us in that ef-
fort. 
POSTMASTER GENERAL 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
tens of millions of Americans rely on 
the post office every day for their 
medication, veterans’ benefits, food, 
and paychecks. This year, tens of mil-
lions of Americans will also rely on the 
post office to vote in our national elec-
tion. As President Trump deliberately 
attempts to erode Americans’ con-
fidence in voting by mail, his hand-
picked 
Postmaster 
General, 
Mr. 
DeJoy—a longtime Republican fund-
raiser and Trump donor—faces serious 
questions about politicizing the post 
office during an election year. 
During his short tenure, Mr. DeJoy 
instituted drastic service changes to 
the Postal Service that caused enor-
mous backlogs and delays in mail de-
livery. Only a massive public outcry 
from both sides of the aisle caused him 
to reverse his course, and now reports 
came out over the weekend that al-
leged that Mr. DeJoy, while he was the 
CEO of New Breed Logistics, may have 
been involved in an illegal straw donor 
scheme in which he pressured employ-
ees into financially supporting Repub-
lican candidates, using company bo-
nuses as reimbursement. 
If these reports are true, they con-
stitute a serious violation of campaign 
finance law. The House has already an-
nounced 
it 
will 
investigate 
these 
claims. So it is time to state the obvi-
ous: The postal Board of Governors 
should suspend Mr. DeJoy as Post-
master General while these serious al-
legations are under investigation. 
In the middle of a pandemic, America 
must have faith and confidence in the 
post office and those who lead it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT H. LUDWIG 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is 
my privilege to recommend the Honor-
able Brett H. Ludwig to be the U.S. dis-
trict judge for the Eastern District of 
Wisconsin. Judge Ludwig passed the 
Senate Judiciary Committee with bi-
partisan support. I look forward to the 
full Senate voting to confirm him 
today. 
Since 2017, Judge Ludwig has served 
the people of Wisconsin on the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Courts for both the East-
ern and Western Districts of Wisconsin. 
Judge Ludwig was born in rural 
north central Wisconsin and spent his 
childhood in the city of Colby, the 
birthplace of the cheese that bears its 
name. His grandparents and great- 
grandparents were dairy farmers, in-
stilling in their children and grand-
children the values of hard work and

dedication that Wisconsin’s farm fami-
lies are known for. 
Brett’s 
father, 
Duane 
Ludwig, 
worked nearly 40 years at a factory 
making corrugated container boxes. 
His mother, Connie, worked as a recep-
tionist, secretary, and medical records 
clerk. They raised him to have a strong 
work ethic and to appreciate the im-
portance of education. 
Judge Ludwig graduated from Colby 
High School in 1987. He attended the 
University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, 
graduating with the highest honors. He 
then attended the University of Min-
nesota Law School on a merit-based 
scholarship. He excelled in his class 
work, ‘‘grading on’’ to the Minnesota 
Law Review. He ultimately graduated 
magna cum laude, was named to the 
Order of the Coif, and then clerked for 
the Honorable George G. Fagg on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth 
Circuit. 
Following his clerkship, Brett re-
turned to Wisconsin to practice at 
Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, the 
largest law firm in Wisconsin and one 
of the oldest law firms in the United 
States. In 2003, Foley & Lardner made 
him a partner, and he spent the next 14 
years building a successful commercial 
litigation practice. In addition to try-
ing more than a dozen complex, multi-
million-dollar cases through judgment, 
he played a crucial role in firm man-
agement, chairing the Milwaukee of-
fice’s recruiting and pro bono commit-
tees. 
Brett’s leadership and contribution 
to his field extended far beyond his 
firm. He was hired by the Marquette 
University Law School to serve as an 
adjunct professor teaching insurance 
law. He served a term on the State Bar 
Board of Governors and was active in 
the Eastern District of Milwaukee Bar 
Association. He was also active in mar-
shaling the efforts of Milwaukee’s larg-
est law firms to commit time and law-
yers to pro bono representations in the 
district court. 
In 2017, Brett left private practice 
when he was selected to serve as a 
bankruptcy judge, where he presided 
over 
more 
than 
12,500 
bankruptcy 
cases, issued more than 20,000 orders, 
and adjudicated dozens of evidentiary 
hearings and trials—all while earning 
the respect of debtors, creditors, and 
their lawyers through his strong judi-
cial temperament, empathy, and com-
passion. 
Judge Ludwig has also shown a 
strong and clear commitment to the 
rule of law. His written decisions re-
flect that he is a judge who is com-
mitted to faithfully applying the Bank-
ruptcy Code and rules as they are writ-
ten. He has demonstrated that he is not 
and will not be an activist judge. 
Judge Ludwig lives just outside Mil-
waukee with his wife, Melissa Bleidorn; 
their children, Madeleine and Ryan; 
and a black lab, Chloe. 
I would like to thank Senator BALD-
WIN for her support of our bipartisan 
nomination commission that has once 
again selected an excellent jurist. 
I would like to thank the hard-work-
ing members of this commission for 
their time and dedication in finding 
and recommending Judge Brett Lud-
wig, who will serve our Nation and the 
people of Wisconsin in the Eastern Dis-
trict with distinction and honor. 
Judge Ludwig has my full support, 
and I urge all my colleagues to vote 
yes on his confirmation. 
I yield the floor.

The proposed sale will improve France’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats 
by 
providing 
the 
necessary 
sustainment, services, and spare parts to 
support the co-managed fleet of French and 
German C–130 aircraft. France will have no 
difficulty absorbing these articles and/or 
services into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Corporation, Marietta, GA; Rolls 
Royce Cooperation, Indianapolis, IN; General 
Electric Aviation System, LTD/Dowty, Ster-
ling, VA; Raytheon, Cedar Rapids, IA; and 
ViaSat, Carlsbad, CA. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of (1) U.S. contractor 
representative to France for a duration of 
three years to provide technical assistance 
and support to include field services, engi-
neering tech support and integrated logistics 
support management. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Volume 
Terminal 
(MIDS–LVT) is an advanced Link–16 com-
mand, control, communications, and intel-
ligence (C3I) system incorporating high-ca-
pacity, jam-resistant, digital communication 
links for exchange of near real-time tactical 
information, including both data and voice, 
among air, ground, and sea elements. MIDS– 
LVT is intended to support key theater func-
tions such as surveillance identification, air 
control, weapons engagement coordination, 
and direction for all services and allied 
forces. The system provides jamming-resist-
ant, wide-area communications on a Link–16

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CANDACE FRANKS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to celebrate Commissioner 
Candace Franks for all she has accom-
plished over her 40-year career with the 
Arkansas 
State 
Bank 
Department, 
ASBD. She will retire as department 
commissioner in October, an especially 
significant milestone given her ap-
pointment as the first female in this 
role and her tenure as the longest serv-
ing commissioner in ASBD history. 
Commissioner Franks’ leadership at 
the ASBD has directly improved the 
economic well-being of Arkansas com-
munities and citizens by ensuring safe, 
convenient, and competitive banking. 
The department was established in 1903 
to fulfill a simple yet essential role: 
regulate Arkansas banks and bank 
holding companies. Since her arrival at 
the department, she has worked tire-
lessly to achieve the mission of safe 
and sound financial institutions that 
garner public confidence. An impres-
sive statistic demonstrates this dedica-
tion: When she began in 1980, the de-
partment oversaw institutions holding 
$7 billion in assets; as she leaves in 
2020, the institutions now hold over 
$123 billion in assets. 
She grounds herself in the notion 
that hard work, commitment, and pa-
tience pay off. After completing three 
postsecondary degrees—two at Arkan-
sas State University in Jonesboro and 
one at the University of Arkansas at 
Little Rock Bowen School of Law—she 
joined the ASBD as general counsel in 
1980. She held this position until she 
was promoted to deputy commissioner 
and general counsel in 1995, before her 
appointment to commissioner in 2007. 
Commissioner 
Franks’ 
ability 
to 
lead, guide, and better the State of Ar-
kansas extends beyond her critical role 
in the financial sector. From 2014 to 
2015, she served as chairman of the 
Conference of State Bank Supervisors, 
where she is now chairman emeritus. 
She currently serves as chairman of 
the Arkansas Public Employees Retire-
ment System after being appointed to 
the board of trustees by Governor Asa 
Hutchinson in 2017. Additionally, she 
serves as a trustee on the Arkansas 
Teachers Retirement System and the 
State Board of Finance. 
It is with no surprise that Commis-
sioner Franks has been repeatedly rec-
ognized for her accomplished career 
and influence in Arkansas. For 3 con-
secutive years—1996, 1997, and 1998—she 
was honored by Arkansas Business as 
one of the ‘‘Top 100 Women in Arkan-
sas.’’ In 2010, she was recognized by the 
same publication as one of 20 ‘‘Women

TRIBUTE TO DONNA KELLY- 
WILLIAMS 
∑ Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
would like to offer my congratulations 
to Donna Kelly-Williams as she retires 
as president of the Massachusetts 
Nurses Association where she has rep-
resented our nurses and the patients 
they serve since 2009. Beginning her 
professional career in 1974, she aided 
nurses in the newborn nursery at the 
Cambridge Hospital, cementing her 
passion for the caregiving profession. 
Following nursing school, she served as 
a medical-surgical nurse and then as a 
pediatric nurse before eventually com-
ing full circle and returning to the ma-
ternity unit. She has spent her entire 
nursing career serving her community 
at Cambridge Hospital in Cambridge, 
MA. Throughout her career, she has al-
ways been committed to creating envi-
ronments where every nurse is re-
spected and valued for their contribu-
tions. This commitment and passion 
for advocacy led her to become in-
volved in the Massachusetts Nurses As-
sociation, first joining the bargaining 
unit at Cambridge Hospital and serving 
in this capacity for two decades. 
She then served as vice president of 
the Massachusetts Nurses Association 
and on the board of directors before she 
was elected president in 2009. As presi-
dent, Donna led the union as they be-
came a part of National Nurses United, 
the largest union of registered nurses 
in history. She understood this partici-
pation in a new national nurses’ union 
enabled members to have an even 
greater impact on national pushes for 
legislation, including healthcare and

labor reforms, supporting nurses serv-
ing in all of America’s hospitals. Donna 
worked 
tirelessly 
to 
advocate 
for 
nurses’ workers rights during strikes; I 
remember trading calls and texts with 
Donna late into the night to settle con-
tracts during the Tufts Medical Center 
strike. 
I am deeply grateful to Donna Kelly- 
Williams for her lifelong commitment 
to America’s working families, for all 
she has done for nurses across the Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts, and for 
her tireless fight to improve patient 
care. We have all benefited from Don-
na’s passion, resilience, and empathy 
throughout her entire career and her 
lasting impact on our Massachusetts 
nurses will be felt for years to come. I 
once again congratulate her on her re-
tirement and wish her the best of luck 
in the next chapter.∑

By Mr. DURBIN: 
S. 4538. A bill to establish a Restore 
Employment in Natural and Environ-
mental Work Conservation Corps in the 
Department of the Interior and the De-
partment of Agriculture, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4538 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Restore Em-
ployment in Natural and Environmental 
Work 
Conservation 
Corps 
Act’’ 
or 
the 
‘‘RENEW Conservation Corps Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) as a result of the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 
(COVID–19) 
pandemic, 
more 
than 
40,000,000 people in the United States have 
filed claims for unemployment benefits since 
March 2020, which is a level of unemploy-
ment not seen since the Great Depression; 
(2) investments in fish, wildlife, and habi-
tat restoration and outdoor recreation infra-
structure generate as many as 33 jobs per 
$1,000,000 invested, as demonstrated by the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009 (Public Law 111–5; 123 Stat. 115); 
(3) the outdoor recreation economy— 
(A) generates $887,000,000,000 in economic 
activity each year, which is 2.2 percent of 
the gross domestic product of the United 
States, according to the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis; and 
(B) was 1 of the fastest growing sectors of 
the United States economy before the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic; 
(4) the Federal Government and State and 
local governments and agencies have many 
‘‘shovel-ready’’ projects and green infra-
structure maintenance backlog projects that 
would improve the quality of life, outdoor 
experiences, and access to outdoor recreation 
opportunities of people of the United States 
on completion of the projects; 
(5) many facilities and natural resources 
located on dedicated conservation land are 
in disrepair or degraded and in need of labor- 
intensive rehabilitation, restoration, and en-
hancement work that cannot be carried out 
at existing staffing levels; 
(6) enhancing and maintaining environ-
mentally and recreationally important land 
and waters through the participation of un-
employed individuals in the United States in 
a conservation corps could— 
(A) provide critical employment, edu-
cation, and skill development opportunities 
to the individuals; 
(B) prepare the individuals for permanent 
jobs in the conservation field; and 
(C) benefit the economy and environment 
of the United States; and 
(7) existing networks of conservation corps 
are in place but need additional resources in 
order to scale up the activities of the con-
servation corps to meet growing deferred 
maintenance needs on public land. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to employ, during the 5-year period be-
ginning on the date of enactment of this Act, 
a total of 1,000,000 people in the United 
States 
in 
dedicated 
conservation 
land 
projects to support the growing backlog of 
deferred conservation land projects; 
(2) to expose Participants to public service 
while furthering the understanding and ap-
preciation of the Participants of the natural 
and cultural resources of the United States; 
(3) to stimulate interest among Partici-
pants in conservation careers by exposing 
the Participants to conservation profes-
sionals in land management agencies; and 
(4) to build on the existing network of con-
servation corps organizations working across 
the United States while providing for ex-
panded participation in urban centers.

Mr. MARKEY, Mr. COONS, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. MERKLEY, and Mr. KAINE) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 684 
Whereas Cameroon is beset with multiple 
security challenges, including a Boko Haram 
insurgency in the Far North region, cross- 
border conflict and criminality by Central 
African militia groups to the east, and a 
civil war involving the Government of Cam-
eroon and Anglophone separatist armed 
groups in the Northwest and Southwest re-
gions; 
Whereas the official actions and policies of 
the Francophone-dominated Government of 
Cameroon have repressed English-speaking 
Cameroonians politically and economically 
throughout the history of Cameroon, dating 
back to the reunification of British-adminis-
tered 
Southern 
Cameroons 
and 
French 
Cameroun under a federal system in October 
1961; 
Whereas Paul Biya, the oldest head of 
state in Africa, has been the President of 
Cameroon since 1982, maintaining his grip on 
power by centralizing authority in the exec-
utive, undermining the Constitution of Cam-
eroon, 
impeding 
democratic 
governance 
through corrupt practices, using security 
services to repress the opposition, and con-
ducting elections marred by widespread 
irregularities and allegations of fraud; 
Whereas key decentralization reforms en-
acted in the Constitution of Cameroon in 
1996, which mandated the establishment of a 
decentralized unitary state, ‘‘equality of all 
citizens before the law’’, the equal status of 
French and English as official languages, and 
the establishment of local authorities with 
‘‘administrative and financial autonomy’’, 
remain largely unrealized, though an ena-
bling law was adopted in December 2019; 
Whereas, throughout his tenure, President 
Biya has spent extended periods in Europe, 
pursued government policies exclusively ben-
efitting the Francophone majority in Cam-
eroon, and crippled many parastatals and 
private enterprises in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions, further marginalizing 
English-speaking Cameroonians; 
Whereas, in October 2016, English-speaking 
lawyers, students, and teachers in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon 
took to the streets to peacefully protest 
marginalization 
of 
English-speaking 
Cameroonians by the Government of Cam-
eroon in the legal and education systems, as 
exemplified by the appointment of French- 
speaking judges and teachers in the North-
west and Southwest regions and the pub-
lishing of important legislation solely in the 
French language; 
Whereas 
those 
peaceful 
protests 
by 
English-speaking 
lawyers, 
students, 
and 
teachers were met with excessive force by 
the police and gendarmerie of Cameroon, 
which led to gross human rights violations, 
the 
arrest 
of 
lawyers, 
teachers, 
and 
Anglophone civic leaders, and their deten-
tion in the notorious Kondengui prison in 
Yaounde´; 
Whereas, amid broader protests across the 
Northwest and Southwest regions demanding 
greater autonomy from the central govern-
ment of Cameroon, on October 1, 2017, the 
56th anniversary of the end of British trust-
eeship 
over 
Southern 
Cameroons, 
the 
Anglophone crisis escalated as separatist 
armed groups declared independence from 
Cameroon; 
Whereas, in late 2017, Anglophone sepa-
ratist armed groups escalated attacks, tar-
geting government officials and facilities as 
well as civilians and traditional leaders seen

September 8, 2020 
as sympathetic to the Government of Cam-
eroon and brutally enforcing ‘‘ghost town op-
erations’’ (general strikes) and school boy-
cotts in the Northwest and Southwest re-
gions; 
Whereas 
lengthy 
government-imposed 
shutdowns of the internet and social media 
in the Northwest and Southwest regions, to-
taling 240 days between 2017 and 2018, had a 
devastating impact on the economies and 
educational institutions in the regions, un-
dermined freedom of expression, prevented 
the free flow of information related to the 
conflict, and restricted the ability of local 
communities to interact and communicate; 
Whereas the conflict in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions of Cameroon has caused 
considerable instability and human suf-
fering, with more than 3,000 deaths linked to 
the conflict, and according to United Nations 
agencies, approximately 3,000,000 people are 
in need of humanitarian assistance, approxi-
mately 60,000 Cameroonian refugees have 
fled to Nigeria, and approximately 700,000 
persons are internally displaced; 
Whereas the Department of State 2019 
Country Report on Human Rights Practices 
for Cameroon cited ‘‘significant’’ human 
rights abuses by security forces and sepa-
ratist armed groups in Cameroon, including 
unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced dis-
appearances, torture, arbitrary detention, 
repression of fundamental rights, and vio-
lence against women and children; 
Whereas the United Nations Children’s 
Fund estimates that more than 855,000 chil-
dren are out of school due to the conflict, 
and the Department of State added Cam-
eroon to the Child Soldiers Prevention Act 
List in the 2020 Trafficking in Persons Re-
port as a foreign government ‘‘identified dur-
ing the previous year as having govern-
mental armed forces, police, or other secu-
rity forces, or government-supported armed 
groups that recruit or use child soldiers’’; 
Whereas United States citizen Charles 
Wesco was shot and killed near the town of 
Bamenda, Cameroon, on October 30, 2018, 
and, in November 2018, the Department of 
State stated, ‘‘In memory of American mis-
sionary Charles Wesco and all others who 
have lost their lives in the Anglophone Cri-
sis, we urge all sides to end the violence and 
enter into broad-based reconciliatory dia-
logue without preconditions.’’; 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Government of 
Switzerland announced that, together with 
the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, it 
was facilitating a dialogue between the Gov-
ernment of Cameroon and armed opposition 
groups to support a resolution of the 
Anglophone crisis; 
Whereas, in September 2019, President Biya 
hastily announced a Major National Dia-
logue, chaired by Prime Minister Ngute from 
September 30 to October 4, 2019, in Yaounde´, 
‘‘to examine the ways and means to respond 
to the deeply-held aspirations of the popu-
lations in the Northwest and Southwest’’; 
Whereas, though the Major National Dia-
logue led to some concessions by the Govern-
ment of Cameroon on broader democratiza-
tion issues, including the release of some po-
litical prisoners, including the leader of the 
Cameroon Renaissance Movement, Maurice 
Kamto, and some of his associates after nine 
months of detention, attempts at conflict 
resolution have failed to bring all parties to 
the table, as high levels of deaths, brutality, 
and suffering continue; 
Whereas national and international out-
rage followed the massacre of at least 23 peo-
ple, including 15 children and 2 pregnant 
women, by government security forces and 
allied militia on February 14, 2020, in 
Ngarbuh, Donga Mantung division, in the 
Northwest region, and a commission of in-
quiry established by Cameroonian authori-
ties ultimately led to the arrest and charg-
ing of 3 soldiers for murder; 
Whereas, on June 5, 2020, amidst increasing 
concern over attacks on freedom of the press 
and detention of journalists on politically 
motivated charges in recent years, Cameroon 
authorities confirmed that an Anglophone 
journalist covering the conflict, Samuel 
Ajiekah Abuwe, known as Wazizi, who was 
arrested in August 2019 and transferred to a 
military facility, died in custody shortly 
after his arrest, an acknowledgment that led 
to widespread condemnation and calls for an 
independent inquiry; 
Whereas the Rapid Intervention Battalion 
(BIR) of the Government of Cameroon, which 
has been accused of torture and extrajudicial 
killings and implicated in massacres like 
that of February 14, 2020, has received train-
ing and support from the United States, po-
tentially in contravention of legal require-
ments that ‘‘no assistance shall be furnished 
. . . to any unit of the security forces of a 
foreign country if the Secretary of State has 
credible information that such unit has com-
mitted a gross violation of human rights’’; 
Whereas, in February 2019, the Department 
of State announced that it would withhold 
some security assistance to Cameroon, in-
cluding equipment and training, citing cred-
ible allegations of human rights violations 
by state security forces and a lack of inves-
tigation, accountability, and transparency 
by the Government of Cameroon in response; 
Whereas, on December 26, 2019, the United 
States terminated the designation of Cam-
eroon as a beneficiary under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 
et seq.) because ‘‘the Government of Cam-
eroon currently engages in gross violations 
of internationally recognized human rights’’; 
Whereas a European Parliament resolu-
tion, passed on April 18, 2019, urged inclusive 
political dialogue to resolve the Anglophone 
crisis, called for the conflict to be considered 
by the United Nations Security Council, and 
urged the European Union to ‘‘use the polit-
ical leverage provided by development aid 
and other bilateral programmes to enhance 
the defense of human rights in Cameroon’’; 
Whereas France maintains considerable in-
terests in Cameroon, including significant 
economic and security cooperation, but has 
not adequately used its influence to stem 
atrocities committed in the Anglophone re-
gions or support stronger international ac-
tion to seek resolution to the conflict; 
Whereas the United Nations Resident and 
Humanitarian Coordinator for Cameroon 
stated on January 24, 2019, that ‘‘Cameroon 
can no longer be a forgotten crisis; it needs 
to be high on our agenda’’, and, on June 22, 
2020, a group of former world leaders and 5 
Nobel Peace Laureates called on the United 
Nations Security Council and the United Na-
tions Secretary-General, the African Union, 
the Commonwealth of Nations, and La 
Francophonie to ‘‘ensure that Cameroon’s 
Anglophone conflict is on the agenda of the 
forthcoming UN Security Council meeting 
and all UNOCA sessions before the UNSC’’; 
Whereas, on May 13, 2019, an Arria-formula 
meeting on the humanitarian crisis in Cam-
eroon was held for the United Nations Secu-
rity Council, but a formal meeting on the 
situation in Cameroon has not yet been 
placed on the United Nations Security Coun-
cil agenda; 
Whereas, on July 1, 2020, in Resolution 2532 
(2020), the United Nations Security Council 
unanimously underlined its support of the 
appeal of the United Nations Secretary-Gen-
eral for a global ceasefire in all conflicts as 
the world battles the COVID–19 pandemic; 
and 
Whereas 
there 
is 
a 
significant 
Cameroonian diaspora in the United States, 
and Cameroon is a longstanding security 
partner and aid recipient of the United 
States, participating in the Trans-Sahara 
Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) led 
by the Department of State and in United 
States-supported efforts to counter Boko 
Haram and the Islamic State–West Africa, 
both of which have mounted terrorist oper-
ations in the Far North region of Cameroon 
since 2014: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) strongly condemns abuses committed 
by state security forces and armed groups in 
the Northwest and Southwest regions of 
Cameroon, including extrajudicial killings 
and detentions, the use of force against civil-
ians and nonviolent protestors, torture, rape, 
kidnappings, and other forms of violence 
against women, and violations of the free-
doms of press, expression, and assembly; 
(2) urges all parties to the Anglophone con-
flict in Cameroon, including political opposi-
tion groups, to— 
(A) conclude and uphold an immediate 
ceasefire; 
(B) guarantee unfettered humanitarian ac-
cess and assistance to the Northwest and 
Southwest regions; 
(C) exercise restraint and ensure that po-
litical protests are peaceful; and 
(D) establish a credible process for an in-
clusive dialogue that includes all relevant 
stakeholders, including from civil society, to 
achieve a sustainable political solution that 
respects the rights and freedoms of all of the 
people of Cameroon; 
(3) affirms that the United States Govern-
ment continues to hold the Government of 
Cameroon responsible for safeguarding the 
safety, security, and constitutional rights of 
all citizens, regardless of their region of ori-
gin or the regions in which they reside, or 
their religious beliefs or political views; 
(4) urges the Government of Cameroon to— 
(A) initiate a credible, inclusive, good-faith 
effort to end the armed conflict in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon by 
addressing the root causes of the crisis and 
grievances and seeking nonviolent solutions 
to resolve the conflict, including possibly in-
volving an independent mediator in negotia-
tions; 
(B) follow through on initiatives developed 
to address the grievances that sparked the 
conflict, including the National Commission 
for the Promotion of Bilingualism and 
Multiculturalism, the Ministry of Decen-
tralization and Local Development, and the 
National Disarmament, Demobilization, and 
Reintegration Committee; 
(C) fully implement recommendations of 
the Major National Dialogue held in late 
2019; 
(D) respect the rule of law and the con-
stitutional rights of all Cameroonians, in-
cluding members of the political opposition, 
civil society activists, and journalists; 
(E) allow for credible, independent, and 
transparent investigations of all allegations 
of human rights abuses committed in the 
Northwest and Southwest regions; 
(F) release all political prisoners and jour-
nalists currently detained and immediately 
stop all arbitrary detention, torture, forced 
disappearances, deaths in custody, and inhu-
mane prison conditions; and 
(G) work with United States law enforce-
ment to thoroughly investigate and pros-
ecute those responsible for the murder of 
Charles Wesco; 
(5) urges the Anglophone armed separatist 
groups to— 
(A) engage peacefully with government of-
ficials to express grievances and engage in 
nonviolent efforts to resolve the conflict, in-
cluding participation in a credible and inclu-
sive dialogue, possibly involving an inde-
pendent mediator;

detained civilians; 
(6) urges the Department of State, Depart-
ment of the Treasury, and United States

on individual government and separatist 
leaders 
‘‘responsible 
for 
extrajudicial

internationally recognized human rights’’; 
(B) press the Government of Cameroon to 
provide unfettered humanitarian access to 
vulnerable populations in the Northwest and

programming, including to meet immediate 
needs, advance nonviolent conflict resolu-

principle of state governance in the Con-
stitution of Cameroon; 
(E) continue to limit security assistance to 
Cameroon and ensure that United States 
training and equipment is not being used to 
facilitate human rights abuses in the North-
west and Southwest regions; 
(F) prioritize efforts to help develop and

sight of law enforcement and security serv-

(G) engage in an ongoing effort to ensure 
that the crisis in the Anglophone regions is 
discussed in international fora, including the 
United Nations Security Council, that focus 
on urgent international diplomatic engage-
ment and response; and 
(7) urges members of the international 
community to— 
(A) join in a strategic collective effort to 
pressure the Government of Cameroon and 
separatist armed groups, including through 
the use of available diplomatic and punitive 
tools, to immediately conclude and uphold a

ances, and seek nonviolent solutions to the 
conflict, including by possibly involving an 
independent and credible mediator; 
(B) mobilize and coordinate funding for

vide humanitarian and development assist-
ance, including to fight coronavirus, to com-
munities affected by the crisis in the North-
west and Southwest regions of Cameroon;

and 
marginalization; and 
(D) use regional and international fora, in-
cluding the African Union, the Economic 
Community of Central African States, and 
the United Nations Security Council to dis-
cuss the ongoing crisis in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions of Cameroon and push for 
a cessation of violence, an expedient resolu-
tion, the implementation of a mutually 
agreed-upon program for addressing the root 
causes and pending grievances, and the in-
vestigation and prosecution of human rights 
abuses and crimes committed against civil-
ians.

TO WORK Act’’. 
SEC. 2002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The SARS–CoV–2 virus that originated 
in China and causes the disease COVID–19 
has caused untold misery and devastation 
throughout the world, including in the 
United States. 
(2) For months, frontline health care work-
ers and health care facilities have fought the 
virus with courage and resolve. They did so 
at first with very little information about 
how to treat the virus and developed strate-
gies to save lives of the people of the United 
States in real time. They risked their per-
sonal health and wellbeing to protect and 
treat their patients. 
(3) Businesses in the United States kicked 
into action to produce and procure personal 
protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, 
face shields, and hand sanitizer, and other 
necessary medical supplies, such as ventila-
tors, at unprecedented rates. 
(4) To halt the spread of the disease, State 
and local governments took drastic meas-
ures. They shut down small and large busi-
nesses, schools, colleges and universities, re-
ligious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions, and local government agencies. 
They ordered people to remain in their 
homes. 
(5) This standstill was needed to slow the 
spread of the virus. But it devastated the 
economy of the United States. The sum of 
hundreds of local-level and State-level deci-
sions to close nearly every space in which 
people might gather brought interstate com-
merce nearly to a halt. 
(6) This halt led to the loss of millions of 
jobs. These lost jobs were not a natural con-
sequence of the economic environment, but 
rather the result of a drastic, though tem-
porary, response to the unprecedented na-
ture of this global pandemic. 
(7) Congress passed a series of statutes to 
address the health care and economic cri-
ses—the Coronavirus Preparedness and Re-
sponse Supplemental Appropriations Act, 
2020 (Public Law 116–123; 134 Stat. 146), the 
Families First Coronavirus Response Act 
(Public Law 116–127; 134 Stat. 178), the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity Act or the CARES Act (Public Law 116– 
136), and the Paycheck Protection Program 
and Health Care Enhancement Act (Public 
Law 116–139; 134 Stat. 620). In these laws Con-
gress exercised its power under the Com-
merce and Spending Clauses of the Constitu-
tion of the United States to direct trillions 
of taxpayer dollars toward efforts to aid 
workers, businesses, State and local govern-
ments, health care workers, and patients. 
(8) This legislation provided short-term in-
sulation from the worst of the economic 
storm, but these laws alone cannot protect 
the United States from further devastation. 
Only reopening the economy so that workers 
can get back to work and students can get 
back to school can accomplish that goal. 
(9) The Constitution of the United States 
specifically enumerates the legislative pow-
ers of Congress. One of those powers is the 
regulation of interstate commerce. The Gov-
ernment is not a substitute for the economy, 
but it has the authority and the duty to act 
when interstate commerce is threatened and 
damaged. As applied to the present crisis, 
Congress can deploy its power over inter-
state commerce to promote a prudent re-
opening of businesses and other organiza-
tions that serve as the foundation and back-
bone of the national economy and of com-
merce among the States. These include 
small and large businesses, schools (which 
are substantial employers in their own right 
and provide necessary services to enable par-
ents and other caregivers to return to work), 
colleges and universities (which are substan-
tial employers and supply the interstate 
market for higher-education services), reli-
gious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions (which are substantial employers 
and provide necessary services to their com-
munities), and local government agencies. 
(10) Congress must also ensure that the Na-
tion’s health care workers and health care 
facilities are able to act fully to defeat the 
virus. 
(11) Congress must also safeguard its in-
vestment of taxpayer dollars under the 
CARES Act and other coronavirus legisla-
tion. Congress must ensure that those funds 
are used to help businesses and workers sur-
vive and recover from the economic crisis, 
and to help health care workers and health 
care facilities defeat the virus. CARES Act 
funds cannot be diverted from these impor-
tant purposes to line the pockets of the trial 
bar. 
(12) One of the chief impediments to the 
continued flow of interstate commerce as 
this public-health crisis has unfolded is the 
risk of litigation. Small and large busi-
nesses, schools, colleges and universities, re-
ligious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions, and local government agencies 
confront the risk of a tidal wave of lawsuits 
accusing them of exposing employees, cus-
tomers, 
students, 
and 
worshipers 
to 
coronavirus. Health care workers face the 
threat of lawsuits arising from their efforts 
to fight the virus. 
(13) They confront this litigation risk even 
as they work tirelessly to comply with the 
coronavirus guidance, rules, and regulations 
issued by local governments, State govern-
ments, and the Federal Government. They 
confront this risk notwithstanding equip-
ment and staffing shortages. And they con-
front this risk while also grappling with con-
stantly changing information on how best to 
protect employees, customers, students, and 
worshipers from the virus, and how best to 
treat it. 
(14) These lawsuits pose a substantial risk 
to interstate commerce because they threat-
en to keep small and large businesses, 
schools, colleges and universities, religious, 
philanthropic and other nonprofit institu-
tions, and local government agencies from 
reopening for fear of expensive litigation 
that might prove to be meritless. These law-
suits further threaten to undermine the Na-
tion’s fight against the virus by exposing our 
health care workers and health care facili-
ties to liability for difficult medical deci-
sions they have made under trying and un-
certain circumstances. 
(15) These lawsuits also risk diverting tax-
payer money provided under the CARES Act 
and other coronavirus legislation from its in-
tended purposes to the pockets of opportun-
istic trial lawyers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5450 
September 8, 2020 
(16) This risk is not purely local. It is nec-
essarily national in scale. A patchwork of 
local and State rules governing liability in 
coronavirus-related lawsuits creates tremen-
dous unpredictability for everyone partici-
pating in interstate commerce and acts as a 
significant drag on national recovery. The 
aggregation of each individual potential li-
ability risk poses a substantial and unprece-
dented threat to interstate commerce. 
(17) The accumulated economic risks for 
these potential defendants directly and sub-
stantially affects interstate commerce. Indi-
viduals and entities potentially subject to 
coronavirus-related liability will structure 
their decisionmaking to avoid that liability. 
Small and large businesses, schools, colleges 
and universities, religious, philanthropic and 
other nonprofit institutions, and local gov-
ernment agencies may decline to reopen be-
cause of the risk of litigation. They may 
limit their output or engagement with cus-
tomers and communities to avoid the risk of 
litigation. These individual economic deci-
sions substantially affect interstate com-
merce because, as a whole, they will prevent 
the free and fair exchange of goods and serv-
ices across State lines. Such economic activ-
ity that, individually and in the aggregate, 
substantially affects interstate commerce is 
precisely the sort of conduct that should be 
subject to congressional regulation. 
(18) Lawsuits against health care workers 
and facilities pose a similarly dangerous risk 
to interstate commerce. Interstate com-
merce will not truly rebound from this crisis 
until the virus is defeated, and that will not 
happen unless health care workers and facili-
ties are free to combat vigorously the virus 
and treat patients with coronavirus and 
those otherwise impacted by the response to 
coronavirus. 
(19) Subjecting health care workers and fa-
cilities to onerous litigation even as they 
have done their level best to combat a virus 
about which very little was known when it 
arrived in the United States would divert im-
portant health care resources from hospitals 
and providers to courtrooms. 
(20) Such a diversion would substantially 
affect interstate commerce by degrading the 
national capacity for combating the virus 
and saving patients, thereby substantially 
elongating the period before interstate com-
merce could fully re-engage. 
(21) Congress also has the authority to de-
termine the jurisdiction of the courts of the 
United States, to set the standards for 
causes of action they can hear, and to estab-
lish the rules by which those causes of action 
should proceed. Congress therefore must act 
to 
set 
rules 
governing 
liability 
in 
coronavirus-related lawsuits. 
(22) These rules necessarily must be tem-
porary and carefully tailored to the inter-
state crisis caused by the coronavirus pan-
demic. They must extend no further than 
necessary to meet this uniquely national cri-
sis for which a patchwork of State and local 
tort laws are ill-suited. 
(23) Because of the national scope of the 
economic and health care dangers posed by 
the risks of coronavirus-related lawsuits, es-
tablishing temporary rules governing liabil-
ity 
for 
certain 
coronavirus-related 
tort 
claims is a necessary and proper means of 
carrying into execution Congress’s power to 
regulate 
commerce 
among 
the 
several 
States. 
(24) Because Congress must safeguard the 
investment of taxpayer dollars it made in 
the CARES Act and other coronavirus legis-
lation, and ensure that they are used for 
their intended purposes and not diverted for 
other purposes, establishing temporary rules 
governing liability for certain coronavirus- 
related tort claims is a necessary and proper 
means of carrying into execution Congress’s 
power to provide for the general welfare of 
the United States. 
(b) PURPOSES.—Pursuant to the powers del-
egated to Congress by article I, section 8, 
clauses 1, 3, 9, and 18, and article III, section 
2, clause 1 of the Constitution of the United 
States, the purposes of this title are to— 
(1) establish necessary and consistent 
standards for litigating certain claims spe-
cific to the unique coronavirus pandemic; 
(2) prevent the overburdening of the court 
systems with undue litigation; 
(3) encourage planning, care, and appro-
priate risk management by small and large 
businesses, schools, colleges and univer-
sities, religious, philanthropic and other 
nonprofit 
institutions, 
local 
government 
agencies, and health care providers; 
(4) ensure that the Nation’s recovery from 
the coronavirus economic crisis is not bur-
dened or slowed by the substantial risk of 
litigation; 
(5) prevent litigation brought to extract 
settlements and enrich trial lawyers rather 
than vindicate meritorious claims; 
(6) protect interstate commerce from the 
burdens of potentially meritless litigation; 
(7) ensure the economic recovery proceeds 
without artificial and unnecessary delay; 
(8) protect the interests of the taxpayers 
by ensuring that emergency taxpayer sup-
port continues to aid businesses, workers, 
and health care providers rather than enrich 
trial lawyers; and 
(9) protect the highest and best ideals of 
the national economy, so businesses can 
produce and serve their customers, workers 
can work, teachers can teach, students can 
learn, and believers can worship.

SEC. 2122. LIABILITY; SAFE HARBOR. 
(a) REQUIREMENTS FOR LIABILITY FOR EXPO-
SURE TO CORONAVIRUS.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, and except as other-
wise provided in this section, no individual 
or entity engaged in businesses, services, ac-
tivities, or accommodations shall be liable in 
any coronavirus exposure action unless the 
plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing 
evidence that— 
(1) in engaging in the businesses, services, 
activities, or accommodations, the indi-
vidual or entity was not making reasonable 
efforts in light of all the circumstances to 
comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance in effect at the time 
of the actual, alleged, feared, or potential for 
exposure to coronavirus; 
(2) the individual or entity engaged in 
gross negligence or willful misconduct that 
caused an actual exposure to coronavirus; 
and 
(3) the actual exposure to coronavirus 
caused the personal injury of the plaintiff. 
(b) REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLY.— 
(1) CONFLICTING
APPLICABLE
GOVERNMENT 
STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE.— 
(A) IN
GENERAL.—If more than 1 govern-
ment to whose jurisdiction an individual or 
entity is subject issues applicable govern-
ment standards and guidance, and the appli-
cable government standards and guidance 
issued by 1 or more of the governments con-
flicts with the applicable government stand-
ards and guidance issued by 1 or more of the 
other governments, the individual or entity 
shall be considered to have made reasonable 
efforts in light of all the circumstances to 
comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance for purposes of sub-
section (a)(1) unless the plaintiff establishes 
by clear and convincing evidence that the in-
dividual or entity was not making reason-
able efforts in light of all the circumstances 
to comply with any of the conflicting appli-
cable government standards and guidance 
issued by any government to whose jurisdic-
tion the individual or entity is subject. 
(B) EXCEPTION.—If mandatory standards 
and regulations constituting applicable gov-
ernment standards and guidance issued by 
any government with jurisdiction over the 
individual or entity conflict with applicable 
government standards and guidance that are 
not mandatory and are issued by any other 
government with jurisdiction over the indi-
vidual or entity or by the same government 
that issued the mandatory standards and 
regulations, the plaintiff may establish that 
the individual or entity did not make reason-
able efforts in light of all the circumstances 
to comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance for purposes of sub-
section (a)(1) by establishing by clear and 
convincing evidence that the individual or 
entity was not making reasonable efforts in 
light of all the circumstances to comply with 
the mandatory standards and regulations to 
which the individual or entity was subject. 
(2) WRITTEN OR PUBLISHED POLICY.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—If an individual or entity 
engaged in businesses, services, activities, or 
accommodations maintained a written or 
published policy on the mitigation of trans-
mission of coronavirus at the time of the ac-
tual, alleged, feared, or potential for expo-
sure to coronavirus that complied with, or 
was more protective than, the applicable 
government standards and guidance to which 
the individual or entity was subject, the in-
dividual or entity shall be presumed to have 
made reasonable efforts in light of all the 
circumstances to comply with the applicable 
government standards and guidance for pur-
poses of subsection (a)(1). 
(B) REBUTTAL.—The plaintiff may rebut 
the presumption under subparagraph (A) by 
establishing that the individual or entity 
was not complying with the written or pub-
lished policy at the time of the actual, al-
leged, feared, or potential for exposure to 
coronavirus. 
(C) ABSENCE
OF
A
WRITTEN
OR
PUBLISHED 
POLICY.—The absence of a written or pub-
lished policy shall not give rise to a pre-
sumption that the individual or entity did 
not make reasonable efforts in light of all 
the circumstances to comply with the appli-
cable government standards and guidance for 
purposes of subsection (a)(1). 
(3) TIMING.—For purposes of subsection 
(a)(1), a change to a policy or practice by an 
individual or entity before or after the ac-
tual, alleged, feared, or potential for expo-
sure to coronavirus, shall not be evidence of 
liability for the actual, alleged, feared, or 
potential for exposure to coronavirus. 
(c) THIRD PARTIES.—No individual or entity 
shall be held liable in a coronavirus exposure 
action for the acts or omissions of a third 
party, unless— 
(1) the individual or entity had an obliga-
tion under general common law principles to 
control the acts or omissions of the third 
party; or 
(2) the third party was an agent of the indi-
vidual or entity. 
(d) MITIGATION.—Changes to the policies, 
practices, or procedures of an individual or 
entity for complying with the applicable 
government standards and guidance after the 
time of the actual, alleged, feared, or poten-
tial for exposure to coronavirus, shall not be 
considered evidence of liability or culpa-
bility.

(a) JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY LIMITA-
TIONS.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—An individual or entity 
against whom a final judgment is entered in 
any coronavirus-related action shall be lia-
ble solely for the portion of the judgment 
that corresponds to the relative and propor-
tionate responsibility of that individual or 
entity. In determining the percentage of re-
sponsibility of any defendant, the trier of 
fact shall determine that percentage as a 
percentage of the total fault of all individ-
uals or entities, including the plaintiff, who 
caused or contributed to the total loss in-
curred by the plaintiff. 
(2) PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.— 
(A) DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY.—In 
any coronavirus-related action, the court 
shall instruct the jury to answer special in-
terrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the 
court shall make findings with respect to 
each defendant, including defendants who 
have entered into settlements with the 
plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning the per-
centage of responsibility, if any, of each de-
fendant, measured as a percentage of the 
total fault of all individuals or entities who 
caused or contributed to the loss incurred by 
the plaintiff. 
(B) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In deter-
mining the percentage of responsibility 
under this subsection, the trier of fact shall 
consider— 
(i) the nature of the conduct of each indi-
vidual or entity found to have caused or con-
tributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; 
and 
(ii) the nature and extent of the causal re-
lationship between the conduct of each such 
individual or entity and the damages in-
curred by the plaintiff. 
(3) JOINT LIABILITY FOR SPECIFIC INTENT OR 
FRAUD.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in 
any coronavirus-related action the liability 
of a defendant is joint and several if the trier 
of fact specifically determines that the de-
fendant— 
(A) acted with specific intent to injure the 
plaintiff; or 
(B) knowingly committed fraud. 
(4) RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTION NOT AFFECTED.— 
Nothing in this subsection affects the right, 
under any other law, of a defendant to con-
tribution with respect to another defendant 
determined under paragraph (3) to have 
acted with specific intent to injure the plain-
tiff or to have knowingly committed fraud. 
(b) 
LIMITATIONS
ON
DAMAGES.—In 
any 
coronavirus-related action— 
(1) the award of compensatory damages 
shall be limited to economic losses incurred 
as the result of the personal injury, harm, 
damage, breach, or tort, except that the 
court may award damages for noneconomic 
losses if the trier of fact determines that the 
personal injury, harm, damage, breach, or 
tort was caused by the willful misconduct of 
the individual or entity; 
(2) punitive damages— 
(A) may be awarded only if the trier of fact 
determines that the personal injury to the 
plaintiff was caused by the willful mis-
conduct of the individual or entity; and 
(B) may not exceed the amount of compen-
satory damages awarded; and 
(3) the amount of monetary damages 
awarded to a plaintiff shall be reduced by the 
amount of compensation received by the 
plaintiff from another source in connection 
with the personal injury, harm, damage, 
breach, or tort, such as insurance or reim-
bursement by a government. 
(c) PREEMPTION AND SUPERSEDURE.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as described in 
paragraphs (2) and (3), this section preempts 
and supersedes any Federal, State, or Tribal 
law, including statutes, regulations, rules, 
orders, proclamations, or standards that are 
enacted, promulgated, or established under 
common law, related to joint and several li-
ability, proportionate or contributory liabil-
ity, contribution, or the award of damages 
for any coronavirus-related action. 
(2) STRICTER LAWS NOT PREEMPTED OR SU-
PERSEDED.—Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of any 
provision of any Federal, State, or Tribal 
law that— 
(A) limits the liability of a defendant in a 
coronavirus-related action to a lesser degree 
of liability than the degree of liability deter-
mined under this section; 
(B) otherwise affords a greater degree of 
protection from joint or several liability 
than is afforded by this section; or 
(C) limits the damages that can be recov-
ered from a defendant in a coronavirus-re-
lated action to a lesser amount of damages 
than the amount determined under this sec-
tion. 
(3) PUBLIC READINESS AND EMERGENCY PRE-
PAREDNESS.—Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of sec-
tion 319F–3 of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247d–6d) to any act or omission in-
volving a covered countermeasure, as defined

care services. Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of sec-
tion 319F–4 of the Public Health Service Act

fore the onset of the first symptoms alleg-

the person on whose behalf the complaint 
was filed and every other person who visited 
the residence of the person on whose behalf

larity each alleged act or omission consti-
tuting gross negligence or willful mis-

damages and the factual basis for the dam-
ages calculation.

MIND.—In any 
coronavirus-related action filed in or re-
moved to a district court of the United 
States in which a claim is asserted on which 
the plaintiff may prevail only on proof that 
the defendant acted with a particular state 
of mind, there shall be filed with the com-
plaint, with respect to each element of that 
claim, a statement of the facts giving rise to 
a strong inference that the defendant acted 
with the required state of mind.

of the Higher Education Act to address needs 
directly related to coronavirus, that shall be 
in addition to awards made in section
