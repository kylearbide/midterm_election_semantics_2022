DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition

AFGHANISTAN AFTERMATH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the 
President hasn’t mentioned Afghani-
stan since he turned the phased, condi-
tional withdrawal under Trump into an 
unconditional 
surrender 
to 
the 
Taliban. Nor has he yet found the time 
to see, much less admit, the chaos that 
his policies have produced by col-
lapsing our southern border. 
Yet, putting these things out of sight 
and mind doesn’t change the dangers 
they have unleashed. I am afraid that 
together, they pose a terrifying pros-
pect for our country that Americans 
should prepare themselves to face in 
coming days. 
Trump’s phased withdrawal included 
keeping Bagram Air Base. This stra-
tegic American asset ensured that U.S. 
airpower could be projected throughout 
the region as both a bulwark to support 
the Afghan defense forces and a deter-
rent to the extremist regimes through-
out the Middle East. In addition, 
Bagram included the Parwan Detention 
Facility that held, under Afghan con-
trol, between 5,000 and 7,000 hardened 
terrorists. 
Instead, Mr. Biden ordered—and his 
woke generals executed—a surprise 
abandonment of Bagram in the dead of 
night without even notifying our allies. 
It took the Afghan Government by 
complete 
surprise 
and 
set 
off 
a 
shockwave that resulted in the rapid 
collapse of Afghan forces. In turn, this 
meant not only the loss of billions of 
dollars of U.S. military equipment to 
the very forces that attacked us on 9/ 
11, but also the release of the most dan-
gerous terrorists in the world. 
Now, we know where one of those ter-
rorists went. Ten days later, Abdul 
Rehman detonated a bomb at the air-
port in Kabul, killing 13 of our service-
men and -women, including a con-
stituent of mine, Sergeant Nicole Gee 
of Roseville, California. 
That is what one of them did. We 
still don’t know where the thousands of 
other terrorists released from Bagram 
are or the plans they are pursuing. 
I think it is a very good bet that 
more than a few of them are making 
their way right now to our open south-
ern border. We know the Border Patrol 
has intercepted a number of known ter-
rorists already. The Government of 
Panama told Congressman GONZALES 
from Texas that it intercepted 52 
known terrorists with intent to make 
their way into the United States and 
tried in vain to warn the Biden admin-
istration. 
What we don’t know is how many 
have already infiltrated our country 
among the tens of thousands admitted 
by the Biden administration since the 
surrender of Bagram. We don’t know 
how 
many 
more 
are 
among 
the 
gotaways who escaped the Border Pa-
trol while it has been overwhelmed 
processing the masses who responded 
to Biden’s open border invitation. Nor 
do we know how many radicalized 
Taliban or ISIS-K are among the near-
ly 100,000 evacuees being admitted into 
the United States from Afghanistan. 
The Homeland Security Secretary, 
Mr. Mayorkas, informed us that it is 
not necessary for them to show that 
they assisted U.S. forces, but only that 
we don’t know of any hostile actions 
that they have committed. In other 
words, if we don’t know who they are 
or what they plan, that is sufficient for 
permanent residence in the United 
States. 
Americans should brace themselves 
for what is surely coming. If these ter-
rorists, unleashed because of the Presi-
dent’s policy in Afghanistan, are able 
to make their way into our country be-
cause of the President’s immigration 
policy, I am afraid that the price paid 
by innocent Americans will be horren-
dous. The mass bombings we read 
about in other countries may soon ar-
rive on our shores, and if they do, the 
responsibility will rest squarely with 
the President, his administration, and 
his apologists in both public office and 
the press. 
On 
October 
14, 
I 
requested 
Mr. 
Mayorkas to provide the number of for-
eign nationals encountered on our 
southern border by nationality, the 
number that were in the Terrorist 
Screening Database, and whether any 
were imprisoned at Bagram Air Base. 
As of this date, we have received no re-
sponse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6182 
November 4, 2021 
Mr. President, wake up. This terror 
is coming. For all we know, it is al-
ready on its way. For all we know, it is 
already here. For God’s sake, secure 
our border, start enforcing our immi-
gration laws, fully vet any asylum 
claims or refugees before they are ad-
mitted into our country. Or else, be 
prepared to bear the full condemnation 
of history for the terrors you will have 
set in motion against your country and 
your countrymen, betraying the high-
est trust in the land. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience. 
f 
TRENDING TOWARD 
AUTHORITARIANISM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, author 
and historian Timothy Snyder said in 
his book, ‘‘On Tyranny: Twenty Les-
sons from the Twentieth Century,’’ 
that ‘‘history does not repeat, but it 
does instruct.’’ 
Indeed, we must constantly work to 
preserve our democratic institutions 
from those who wish to threaten them 
because one of the most powerful in-
structions or lessons from the last cen-
tury is that democracy is deeply frag-
ile, and more importantly, it can trend 
and fall into authoritarianism. 
There are those in this country who 
are ignoring the lessons of the past, or 
worse. Some of the most popular news 
programs, Facebook groups, and social 
media networks are those that spread 
deliberate or negligent misinformation 
for partisan gain, sure, but for finan-
cial gain especially. 
In 2018, the American Institutional 
Confidence Poll found that only 69 per-
cent of Americans believed democracy 
is always preferable to any other kind 
of government. The remaining 31 per-
cent either reported that they were 
open to authoritarianism under some 
circumstances or they were so disillu-
sioned with politics that the type of 
government didn’t matter. 
While 69 percent may not seem 
alarming, it is nearly the same number 
of Hungarians who reported that demo-
cratic values, such as multiparty elec-
tions, were ‘‘very important’’ the same 
year that autocratic Hungarian Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban began his ascent 
to power. 
Alarmingly, American conservative 
pundits have been praising Orban for 
his brand of strongman authoritar 
ianism for months, while Orban’s rule 
has been marked by state control of 
the media; restrictions on LGBTQ and 
immigrant communities; and suppres-
sion of free speech, a free media, and 
political opposition. 
Despite Orban’s assault on global 
democratic values, conservative com-
mentators here at home have endorsed 
his policies and have held him up as an 
example of what Americans should 
look for in a leader. These pundits have 
praised him for rejecting immigrants 
and refugees and have embraced his 
brand of ethnoreligious nationalism. 
This praise for autocratic leaders and 
authoritarianism is dangerous. 
Perhaps many believe that what hap-
pened in Hungary, the swift consolida-
tion of political power and manipula-
tion of political institutions, could not 
happen here. But one of the important 
lessons of the Trump Presidency is 
that we cannot afford to be compla-
cent. 
Over the past 4 years, we watched 
media and leaders on the right excuse 
or 
even 
support 
former 
President 
Trump as he leaned into authoritar 
ianism and incited violence. During his 
time in office, the former President’s 
actions 
often 
echoed 
those 
of 
strongmen like Orban. 
The former President used his office 
to target political rivals, including the 
efforts in Ukraine that ultimately led 
to his impeachment, treated the De-
partment of Justice as his own per-
sonal police force, violently put down 
protests against him, used the Presi-
dency to enrich himself, embraced po-
litical strongmen across the globe, and 
intentionally inflamed political ten-
sions to his own benefit. 
I believe history can and should con-
tinue to inform us, but we don’t have 
to look back very far. The trends devel-
oping around the world and in our own 
country are warning about the threat 
of authoritarianism. 
At a time when political polarization 
has led to violent attacks on demo-
cratic institutions across the country 
and in this very room, it is reckless to 
be feeding into these divisions. 
They are preying on deep ideological 
divides in this country and on their fol-
lowers’ fears. They exploit economic 
anxieties and concerns over immigra-
tion and globalization. They advocate 
for a society where the voices of those 
who offer different opinions are threat-
ened or silenced. 
A poll just released by the Public Re-
ligion Research Institute found that 40 
percent of those who subscribe to the 
farthest right media agree with the 
statement that ‘‘true American patri-
ots may have to resort to violence in 
order to save this country.’’ 
These statistics should be alarming 
to all of us. But those who peddle in-
cendiary and harmful rhetoric are 
using the trends toward authoritar 
ianism to their cynical advantage. 
Authoritarianism thrives on polar-
ization and uncertainty. Those who ex-
ploit, not repair, these cracks in our 
democracy do so for the explicit pur-
pose of increasing their own power. 
We must recognize their true inten-
tions and work to preserve the democ-
racy they seek to threaten. 
All media outlets have an obligation 
to present Orban and others like him 
as they are, repressive demagogues who 
threaten liberty and the rule of law. 
We must continue to recognize our 
common interests and those that have 
made our country the envy of the 
world: our freedoms of expression, eco-
nomic mobility, and our deep cultural 
richness. 
Orban’s rule is a warning to all of us.

RECOGNIZING STAFF OF LEVINE 
CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to enter into the 117th CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD an example of service 
beyond the call of duty of two surgeons 
and an amazing team of nurses and 
staff working at the Levine Children’s 
Hospital located in Charlotte, North 
Carolina. 
On Sunday, August 22, 2021, while en-
joying a relaxing day at our family 
farm, our 5-year-old grandson, Blair 
Beckham, got his hand entangled in 
the steel winch located at the front of 
a four-wheeler while attempting to pull 
a canoe out of a pond. 
I was able to pull his hand out of the 
winch just before his entire arm would 
have been severed by the steel pulley, 
but not before his index finger was sev-
ered and attached only by a single ar-
tery and his middle finger remained at-
tached, but all veins, bones, and joints 
were totally shattered. 
I immediately wrapped his hand in a 
towel and drove to the emergency room 
at our local hospital, where he spent 3 
hours before the ambulance trans-
ported him to Levine Children’s Hos-
pital located in Charlotte, North Caro-
lina. 
The ambulance arrived at the Levine 
Children’s Hospital at 9 p.m., and it 
was there that Dr. Dan Lewis, a faculty 
member of OrthoCarolina and a mem-
ber of the American Association of 
Hand Surgeons, and Dr. Keith Nord, 
who had instructed the staff at the 
emergency room at Piedmont Medical 
Center on the medical procedures to 
take while Blair was being transported 
to the Levine Children’s Hospital and 
who was a specialist in hand surgery 
and serving a fellowship at the hos-
pital, examined Blair and scheduled 
him immediately for emergency sur-
gery that night. 
The expedient and easy determina-
tion for these doctors to make would 
have been to amputate both fingers, as 
the loss of two fingers was not life- 
threatening and the surgery involved 
attaching the index finger, which was 
dangling by a lone vein, which was the 
size of one-fourth of the width of a 
human hair, and totally reconstructing 
the middle finger, which was com-
pletely shattered. The decision, how-
ever, was made to attempt to save the 
two fingers and to perform a surgery 
that lasted over 5 hours, beginning on a 
Sunday night at 11:30 p.m. and ending 
at 4:30 a.m. 
Blair stayed in Levine Children’s 
Hospital for 8 days, August 22 through 
August 29, where he had medical leech

therapy, which is a rarely used treat-
ment prescribed by Dr. Lewis that pro-
vided the necessary suction for obtain-
ing adequate blood flow for the severed 
finger. 
Dr. Lewis and Dr. Nord, along with 
the entire nursing staff, went above the 
call of duty to take part in a successful 
surgery lasting over 5 hours, until the 
middle of the night, in order that a 5- 
year-old boy could have a normal hand 
with all five fingers. 
The 2 weeks of post-op care by Dr. 
Lewis and Dr. Nord was exceptional, 
and Blair now has the full use of the 
two once-damaged fingers on a fully 
functional hand. 
The dedication and passion that Dr. 
Lewis and Dr. Nord demonstrated, 
along with the nurses and staff, where 
they were willing to sacrifice their 
time and use their medical talent to 
perform a surgery that had a minimal 
chance of success was a testament to 
the age-old statement ‘‘service above 
self.’’ 
Dr. Dan Lewis and Dr. Keith Nord are 
a living testimony of the Hippocratic 
oath, which they swore to uphold as 
medical professionals. As the ending 
statement reads, ‘‘May I always act so 
as to preserve the finest traditions of 
my calling and may I long experience 
the joy of healing those who seek my 
help.’’ 
May God bless those two doctors and 
nurses and staff that made this surgery 
a total success.

FEDERAL TRIO PROGRAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to discuss something 
that is very, very important to me as 
public policy, but it is something that 
is really personal to me, and that is the 
Federal TRIO Programs. 
The TRIO programs are a set of high-
er education initiatives authorized by 
the Higher Education Act of 1965 that 
provide an educational opportunity to 
first-generation, low-income students. 
You see, in 1969, at age 18, as a high 
school senior, I became pregnant with 
my first daughter, Jesselynne. I was a 
college-bound student, suddenly feeling 
that I was derailed from my prospects 
and my future, but the outreach of the 
TRIO programs in Marquette Univer-
sity enabled me to get a high-quality 
education at Marquette University, 
else I might have slipped through the 
cracks. 
You see me here standing today as a 
Member of Congress, but even prior to 
that, I contributed greatly to my com-
munity, because of my educational op-
portunity, as someone who created af-
fordable housing through our State 
agency, put together a financial insti-
tution, a credit union for low-income 
communities to fill the financial gaps, 
and contributed in so many other 
ways, including paying taxes—and by 
the way, my daughter is a special edu-
cation teacher today. 
But 
without 
TRIO 
support, 
I 
wouldn’t be here, and there are so 
many other millions of young people 
who are talented, but they are just 
poor and don’t have the family back-
ground to enable them to get to col-
lege. Access to quality and affordable 
education can change your entire life 
because a college education is one of 
the greatest democratizers and great-
est equalizers in our democratic soci-
ety. And that is why it has been the 
honor of my career to be the cochair of 
the bipartisan TRIO Caucus here in 
Congress to pay it forward for the next 
generation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce 
a resolution, along with my cochair, 
MIKE SIMPSON, in recognizing Novem-
ber 8 as National First-Generation 
Celebration Day, a day that commemo-
rates the signing of the Higher Edu-
cation Act of 1965 by President Lyndon 
Baines Johnson. 
I thank the many Members who 
signed on to our resolution, especially 
our 
Senate 
cosponsors, 
Senator 
WARNOCK, a TRIO alum, and Senator 
MARSHALL, a first-generation college 
graduate, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I 
didn’t take this opportunity to high-
light how the Build Back Better Act 
will help to advance the goal of helping 
more first generation and students of 
modest means get to college and be 
able to benefit from the programs like 
TRIO that can help to ensure that they 
graduate and gain the skills necessary 
to participate in our ever, ever com-
plicated economy. And without efforts 
to make higher education affordable 
and reducing the debt burden on our 
students, I am afraid that many stu-
dents will never have the opportunity 
to benefit from TRIO, so we need to do 
more to make sure that cost is not a 
barrier to quality higher education. 
And that is why I think the Build 
Back Better effort—and I just want to 
call out Chairman BOBBY SCOTT for all 
the work he did in increasing the max-
imum Pell grants to help low-income 
students get to college. It is clear that 
Pell grants haven’t kept up with the 
rising costs of college and would pro-
vide $500 million over 7 years for grants 
to States and institutions of higher 
education and Tribal communities and 
universities to improve student out-
comes, including enrollment retention, 
completion, and employment place-
ment. 
So I just thought it was important to 
say that when the Build Back Better 
bill gets to the floor, we should all sup-
port it for the educational initiatives 
that are in it. 
But the story of TRIO is a remark-
able one that benefits students of all 
races, creeds, colors, both genders, vet-
erans. It ought to be celebrated. 
Mr. Speaker, I am urging, when it 
comes to the floor, that you all support 
the bipartisan resolution to celebrate 
National First-Generation Day. 
RECOGNIZING SHERIFF KELLY 
ROWE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a trusted leader in 
Lubbock County and a man I am 
blessed to call a dear friend, Sheriff 
Kelly Rowe. 
Sheriff Rowe was recently elected by 
his peers to be president of the Sher-
iff’s Association of Texas. I can think 
of no better Texas lawman to represent 
the character and noble calling of the 
law enforcement profession, and the 
central tenet of a free society, law and 
order, than Kelly Rowe. 
Sheriff Rowe served in the United 
States Army and the Texas National 
Guard. He has been part of the Sheriff’s 
Department since 1999, but he has been 
our sheriff for the last decade. 
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, law en-
forcement in Texas is under tremen-
dous strain as they work to protect our 
citizens and secure our southern bor-
der, which is in complete chaos as a re-
sult of our Federal Government’s fail-
ure to defend our country and our 
President’s failure to uphold the laws 
of the land. As unprecedented numbers 
of 
crime, 
drugs, 
and 
gangs 
pour 
through our open border, our law en-
forcement officers have never been 
more important to the safety of our 
neighborhoods and our families. Sheriff 
Rowe is a leader among his colleagues 
and the Lone Star State is safer and 
stronger as a result of his service. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank his lovely 
wife, Nola, and their family for sharing 
Kelly selflessly with our communities. 
Law enforcement, as you know, is a 
family commitment. It is a family sac-
rifice. 
So congratulations to Sheriff Rowe 
on this great honor. We are incredibly 
grateful for his service. We are ex-
tremely proud of his leadership con-
tributions to West Texas and beyond. 
God bless the men and women in 
blue. God bless America. And go West 
Texas. 
CONGRATULATING BRYAN MUDD 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Bryan Mudd on 
20 years of service at KAMC, which is a 
local television station there in Lub-
bock. Bryan’s dedication to keeping 
the citizens of Lubbock and the sur-
rounding area informed about what is 
happening at home and across this 
country has been invaluable to West 
Texas. 
Bryan and his wife, Sherry, are both 
servant leaders who go above and be-
yond their work to give of their time 
and talents to support many causes and 
multiple non-profits in our community. 
And I know their fellow West Texans 
and I am deeply grateful for their ef-
forts. 
I have always appreciated Bryan and 
his commitment to excellence in jour-
nalism and his unwavering dedication 
to bringing timely, fair, and balanced 
news to the people of West Texas.

BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, Con-
gressional Democrats have been fo-
cused on working with President Biden 
to deliver long overdue investments for 
the American people and for our fu-
ture. 
We started earlier this year with the 
American Jobs Act, which got critical 
resources, including vaccines, into our 
communities and put money in people’s 
pockets. We helped struggling busi-
nesses and schools, and we did so much 
more. 
Now, we are on the cusp of passing 
two bills that will enormously improve 
the lives of all Americans, the Build 
Back Better Act and the bipartisan In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
These two bills together will rebuild 
America’s aging and failing infrastruc-
ture, create jobs, cut taxes and lower 
costs for families, protect and recog-
nize the contributions of immigrants, 
tackle the climate crisis, and so much 
more. 
Mr. Speaker, my district of El Paso, 
Texas, has long suffered from chronic 
poverty due to lack of access to many 
resources and economic opportunities. 
On healthcare, my State of Texas has 
the highest rate of uninsured residents 
in the Nation. In my community of El 
Paso, a quarter of my residents have 
absolutely no health insurance whatso-
ever. 
On climate, El Paso has seen the sec-
ond highest increase in average tem-
peratures over the past 45 years with 
the number of 100-degree days pre-
dicted to double. 
On family care, nearly half of the 
people, 48 percent of the people, live in 
a childcare desert with no access to 
childcare whatsoever. 
On education, in my State of Texas 
your education and the amount of 
money invested in K–12 kids depends on 
your ZIP Code and where you live. 
The historic investments that we will 
be making with both of these bills will 
strengthen healthcare access to Texas 
families by expanding Medicare cov-
erage for those who have been denied. 
They will protect our communities 
from the consequences of the climate 
crisis by helping us lower emissions, 
advancing a clean energy economy, and 
advancing environmental justice. 
These bills will support families with 
the child tax credit, which will benefit 
173,000 children in El Paso alone, in ad-
dition to the investments in childcare, 
home healthcare, paid family and med-
ical leave, workforce development, and 
universal pre-K, which is probably the 
best predictor for school success and 
for kids who end up going to college. 
My community needs that. My kids in 
El Paso deserve that. 
Americans 
everywhere 
need 
this 
health and support, and they need it 
now. These investments are fully paid 
for. They will not add to the deficit, 
and because these expenditures rep-
resent less than one percent of our 
GDP over the next decade, and because 
they are paid for in part by making 
corporations and the wealthiest Ameri-
cans pay their fair share, the Build 
Back Better Act will not increase infla-
tion. 
I am so proud to have played a role in 
crafting these bills. I am so proud to 
advance them and ensure that they up-
lift El Paso families, improve our econ-
omy, and help save our planet.

RECOGNIZING BILL WOMACK, 
WORLD WAR II HERO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in advance of Veterans Day, to 
take a moment for our country, to 
take a moment and to thank those who 
have served. You are going to see some 
faces on here, and I am just going to 
highlight five individuals from my dis-
trict in West Texas, amongst the thou-
sands who have offered to serve. Many 
of these are part of the Greatest Gen-
eration and this is the greatest country 
in the world, and it is because of their 
sacrifices. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
a World War II hero, Mr. Bill Womack 
of Midland, Texas, who celebrated his 
100th birthday this year. Mr. Womack 
joined the National Guard immediately 
after graduating high school. And after 
the 
Pearl 
Harbor 
bombing, 
Mr. 
Womack became an artilleryman sta-
tioned in North Africa and Europe. 
Bill is one of the legendary Texas 
Liberators, a group of 488 Texans who 
fought against the Nazi regime to lib-
erate Jewish prisoners. He was among 
the group of heroes who first breached 
the concentration camp, Dachau, and 
helped bring World War II prisoners to 
safety. 
Countless lives were saved because of 
the efforts and the selflessness of Mr. 
Womack.

RECOGNIZING PHIL GEORGE 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight a hero of mine, Mr. 
Phil George, of San Angelo, Texas, a 
distinguished veteran and university 
basketball coach. 
Mr. George is a legend in my home-
town of San Angelo. He is a veteran of 
not only World War II and Korea, but 
also of Vietnam where he spent years 
as an incredibly talented fighter pilot. 
When our Nation called, he answered, 
multiple times. I cannot overstate the 
sacrifices that he made both profes-
sionally and also in his community 
after his service in the military. Not 
only is he a hero, but he is also a men-
tor to so many. 
He leaves a legacy in San Angelo to 
this day of the selfless ability to lead 
others, to motivate others, to a life of 
service. His stories are incredible. His 
faith in God is palpable, and his love 
for his late wife, Toddy, and his entire 
family, are inspiring. 
In addition to his record of service, 
he has an incredible record as a basket-
ball coach and athletic director at An-
gelo State University. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. George for 
his service to this Nation. 
RECOGNIZING MAYNARD SCHWERTNER 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Mr. Maynard Schwertner, a 
Vietnam veteran who spent his entire 
life in the service of this country, both 
in Vietnam and back at home. 
As a well driller in Vietnam, Mr. 
Schwertner spent his time providing 
clean water for civilians and the mili-
tary. Back at home, Mr. Schwertner 
has dedicated his life to serving fellow 
veterans, and that includes helping es-
tablish Vietnam veterans chapters, me-
morials, and support groups in San An-
gelo, Texas. He is a distinguished mem-
ber of the community who lives a life 
dedicated to supporting our Nation and 
our Armed Forces. 
RECOGNIZING GILBERTO TORRES 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Mr. Gilberto Torres for his 
service in World War II. Gilberto was 
part of the second wave of the D-day 
invasion of Normandy, the legendary 
amphibious invasion that turned the 
tide of the war and led the allies to lib-
erate Europe. 
Tragically, when trekking through 
war-torn Europe, Gilberto was fired 
upon and struck by enemy machine 
guns. He survived his injuries and was 
honorably discharged, but not before 
earning many medals for his heroism 
and his bravery, including the Purple 
Heart and the Bronze Star Medal, and 
many more. He is in his 90s today and 
he hopes to visit Normandy. I hope he 
can do that. 
RECOGNIZING J.L. STEVENS 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Mr. J.L. Stevens, a 
west Texan, a World War II veteran 
who also took part in both the Nor-
mandy invasion on D-day and the inva-
sion of Okinawa. 
His service to this country was in-
spired at the age of 17 as he enlisted in 
the Navy with the desire to follow in 
the footsteps of his brother. Stevens’ 
sacrifice helped create a safer world for 
his two daughters, his six grand-
children, 
and 
his 
12 
great-grand-
children. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is important 
for us to recognize the service of all of 
these servicemembers as we approach 
Veterans Day. These are just a few sto-
ries, among many, bipartisan in all of 
our districts. My hope is that this 
country can look to the service of 
these, many of whom are part of the 
greatest generation, and we can realize 
that this is the greatest country in the 
world, but it is not without sacrifice.

November 4, 2021 
It is these folks and it is their fami-
lies’ sacrifice who brought us together. 
Once again, I believe that going for-
ward, veterans just like these will con-
tinue to bring us together. It is my 
challenge to everybody in this body 
and all across the United States that 
we recognize our veterans’ service and 
their families’ sacrifices as we ap-
proach Veterans Day.

BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, we stand on a prec-
ipice in which shortly we are about to 
deliver truly a once-in-a-generation 
piece of legislation; action that will 
lower the everyday costs that burden 
working families in my district in 
Pennsylvania and throughout the Na-
tion—from healthcare to childcare and 
more—and fully paid for by making 
corporations and the richest 1/10 of 1 
percent pay their fair share. 
Here is what it does: First, lower 
healthcare costs: negotiating lower 
drug costs for seniors; halting Big 
Pharma’s outrageous price hikes well 
above inflation; and expanding the Af-
fordable Care Act to make coverage 
more affordable for those who buy 
their own insurance. 
Second, lower childcare and family 
care costs: expanding the basic promise 
of free schooling in America for the 
first time in a century with universal 
preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. 
This is so critical. In my State, the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, only 
16 percent of 3- and 4-year-olds have ac-
cess to universal pre-K. It also will 
slash families’ childcare costs; extend 
the landmark Biden Child Tax Credit, 
which has helped reduce child poverty 
in this country this year by 50 percent; 
and will expand access to affordable 
home care for older adults and those 
with disabilities. 
Third, we are talking about the larg-
est investment to combat the climate 
crisis in our Nation’s history: cutting 
pollution; reducing energy costs; cre-
ating good-paying jobs with a trans-
formational 
investment 
to 
ensure 
America leads the worldwide clean en-
ergy economy. 
Why would we want China to take 
the lead on that? They are already in-
vesting a ton of money in clean energy. 
It is time for the United States to 
catch up and take the lead. We are the 
number one country, but in order to re-
main the number one country, we have 
to get with it when it comes to where 
the jobs will be in this century. 
The Build Back Better Act lowers 
costs and fights inflation because—and 
I hope everyone hears this—it is fully 
100 percent paid for. Not one person 
who makes under $400,000 a year will 
pay one extra dime in taxes, not one. 
In fact, many, especially those families 
with children, will see their taxes go 
down. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to paraphrase— 
and I hope I have the quote exactly 
right; I am going on memory. I remem-
ber when I was growing up in Pennsyl-
vania some decades ago in the 1980s, 
our Governor was Bob Casey, Sr., a leg-
endary figure in Pennsylvania politics. 
He once said: What did you do when 
you had the power? That is a question 
that will be asked of all public serv-
ants. What did you do to help people 
when you had the power? That is what 
the Build Back Better Act is about, an-
swering that question; delivering in all 
of these measures that I just cited. 
Once this passes the House, passes 
the Senate, and is signed into law, it 
will truly be the most important do-
mestic bill in my lifetime. It will help 
ordinary people, from the Second Con-
gressional District of Pennsylvania, to 
all 435 congressional districts in this 
Nation. Working families deserve it. 
Look at how hard it is today to 
achieve 
the 
American 
Dream. 
We 
know, based on statistics, that working 
families and middle class families are 
struggling out there. Yes, the unem-
ployment rate is coming down. We are 
in such a better position right now 
than where we were a year ago. Every 
single statistic supports that. It is not 
enough. We need to build back and we 
need to build back better. 
f 
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS REMAIN 
UNSPENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, right now, as our country 
continues to suffer from the negative 
effects of the Democrats’ previous 
reckless spending spree, it is clear that 
we do not yet need another reckless 
spending bill that would further bal-
loon our debt and raise all inflation 
without actually addressing the issues 
that we are currently facing. 
Congress has already appropriated 
trillions of dollars that has not yet 
been spent. Again, trillions of dollars 
remain unspent. Instead of passing yet 
another trillion-dollar spending bill, of 
which only 10 percent would actually 
go to true infrastructure, we can repur-
pose those earlier funds to meet the 
needs of our communities. 
I am proud to be joining my col-
leagues as a cosponsor of legislation 
that would use the money that Con-
gress has already approved to truly 
help the communities that we serve; 
legislation 
that 
has 
already 
been 
passed by our colleagues in the Senate. 
Now is not the time to waste money 
on taxpayer-funded kickbacks to green 
energy companies or spend $50 million 
to monitor coastal erosion. We need to 
fund infrastructure improvements that 
our communities need. We need to do 
so without mortgaging our children’s 
future. 
We were elected to be responsible 
stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars, and 
passing the Green New Deal dressed up 
as infrastructure is not the way for-
ward. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ROSS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss the urgent need to pass the 
Build Back Better agenda, a trans-
formational package that will help in-
dividuals and working families across 
North Carolina. 
This bold legislation will bring down 
the high costs that have held families 
back for decades by making childcare, 
home care, education, healthcare, and 
housing more affordable. This is a 
package for the people—all the peo-
ple—and it spans generations, pro-
viding support to infants, students, 
working adults, and older Americans. 
Right now, the average annual cost 
for a child in North Carolina to attend 
a childcare center is nearly $9,000. The 
average North Carolina family with 
two young children spends more than 
20 percent of their annual income on 
childcare. That is unacceptable. For 
kids to thrive and for parents to excel 
in the workplace, we need quality, af-
fordable childcare. 
I have a constituent from Cary, 
North Carolina, named Katy, she works 
at a nonprofit and has a 1-year-old 
child. She told me this: 
Becoming a mom has opened my eyes to 
how broken our Nation’s childcare system is. 
We felt lucky to find a spot for my child at 
a high-quality childcare program, but the 
cost was shocking. We pay more than $800 a 
month for my son’s care. 
At the same time, the director and teach-
ers at my son’s program likely don’t make a 
living wage. 
They’re doing one of the most important 
jobs in the world, helping raise the next gen-
eration. Why aren’t they compensated fair-
ly? 
Childcare providers shouldn’t have to work 
second jobs on the weekends to feed their 
families, but many do. 
At the same time, parents can’t shoulder 
the burden. 
In 
fact, 
the 
extremely 
high 
cost 
of 
childcare is a major factor for my family as 
we decide to have a second child. 
Katy’s story is so common. If we 
claim to value our children and our 
families, we need to stop turning a 
blind eye to the exploding costs of 
childcare. We can do better. 
That is why the Build Back Better 
Act will provide universal pre-K for all 
3- and 4-year-olds and limit childcare 
costs for working families to no more 
than 7 percent of their income. 
Mr. Speaker, we also need to do more 
for our seniors and their loved ones. 
Every American should be able to look 
forward to a comfortable, secure retire-
ment. Our seniors should not have to 
worry 
about 
financially 
burdening 
their children and their grandchildren. 
In my family, my father-in-law want-
ed to stay in the home he loved, and he 
did until he was 98 years old. We found

it very difficult to find him home care. 
I continue to hear stories from seniors 
in my district who have had to give up 
their homes simply to stay in a nursing 
home. 
Again, we can do better. That is why 
the Build Back Better Act will provide 
a historic investment in home care in 
order to help the more than 800,000 peo-
ple on State Medicaid waiting lists. 
Mr. Speaker, when we pass this bill, 
more of our people will stop struggling 
to make ends meet and start experi-
encing true financial security. 
When we pass this bill, more of our 
children and our seniors will receive 
the care they deserve. And, most im-
portantly, when we pass this bill we 
will be one giant step closer to an 
America 
where 
everyone 
has 
the 
chance to pursue the American Dream 
and the means to support their fami-
lies. 
f 
OPTIONS OVER TERMINATIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, there 
is no doubt about it, we are in a time 
of crisis largely fueled by the Demo-
cratic Party and President Biden’s 
policies. Store shelves are increasingly 
empty, the cost of basic goods is soar-
ing, supply chains are failing, ports are 
backlogged, and government restric-
tions on domestic energy have driven 
the price of gasoline to 7-year highs. 
Who is it that foots the bill for these 
progressive policies? I will tell you, it 
is hardworking American families. 
b 1045 
Rather than address the underlying 
causes of scarcity by bolstering Amer-
ican production and enhancing our Na-
tion’s energy independence, the Biden 
administration has worsened the situa-
tion with their dictatorial policies and 
mandates, most recently in the form of 
an executive order requiring all Fed-
eral employees and contractors be fully 
vaccinated against COVID–19 by No-
vember 22 and December 8, respec-
tively. 
The alternative? Termination. 
This mandate goes too far and has 
become a model for Democratic Gov-
ernors across the country—including 
my own State of Washington’s Gov-
ernor Inslee—who are using it to jus-
tify their own drastic actions and im-
pose similar State-level mandates. 
Now, in addition to the hundreds of 
State emergency personnel who are al-
ready out of work, threatening the 
safety of our communities, central 
Washington also has hundreds of Fed-
eral workers and contractors who are 
facing termination. 
American businesses have been strug-
gling enough to find workers, fill pro-
duction shifts, and deliver goods. Presi-
dent Biden’s one-size-fits-all vaccine 
mandate will further hammer our 
small businesses, driving up prices, 
slowing down deliveries, and exacer-
bating supply chain problems. 
First 
responders 
and 
frontline 
healthcare workers are also being fired 
for not complying with COVID–19 vac-
cine mandates. In the State of Wash-
ington, we have seen hundreds of our 
brave law enforcement officers forced 
to choose between vaccination and 
doing their jobs. Leaving our commu-
nities, which are facing rising crime 
rates, unprotected is not going to in-
crease anyone’s safety. 
Hospitals and health clinics are expe-
riencing staffing shortages as well. The 
remaining employees are then over-
worked to compensate, leading to burn-
out and increased staff turnover. Leav-
ing our hospitals understaffed is not 
going to help our communities over-
come this public health crisis. 
President Biden’s deadline for the 
vaccine mandate brushes right up 
against the peak holiday season. Since 
cargo distribution companies are al-
ready battling unprecedented labor 
shortages, this mandate is likely to 
wreak havoc on the global supply chain 
when it is stressed the most, during the 
holidays. Leaving our tables empty and 
the space under our Christmas trees 
bare is not going to improve morale. 
But why is President Biden perpet-
uating a permanent state of emer-
gency? The only answer that comes to 
mind is that he is more concerned 
about expanding governmental control 
than the safety and stability of our 
workforce or the protection of our indi-
vidual rights. 
Not only does this mandate go 
against our inalienable rights pro-
tected in the Constitution, but it ig-
nores the fact that natural immunity 
also provides protection against infec-
tion from the virus. In fact, other 
countries have adopted policies uphold-
ing this as a valid, science-based ex-
emption from vaccine requirements. 
The mandate also doesn’t allow work-
ers to opt out through frequent COVID 
testing, as many private businesses 
have chosen to do. 
Federal employees who have opted 
not to receive the vaccine because they 
have natural immunity developed after 
recovering from the virus do not de-
serve to be fired, especially when those 
same men and women have worked 
tirelessly to keep our communities safe 
and healthy before there was even a 
vaccine 
available. 
These 
men 
and 
women, who have been on the front 
lines since the beginning of the pan-
demic 
and 
risking 
their 
families’ 
health and safety to ensure our Federal 
and State projects continued and that 
our communities remained protected, 
deserve our respect, not our condemna-
tion. 
But the President has doubled down 
on his policies, stating that he abso-
lutely thinks police officers and emer-
gency responders should be fired if they 
do not comply with this mandate. 
That is why I introduced the Options 
Over Terminations Act. This legisla-
tion would provide an exemption to the 
Federal COVID–19 mandate for any 
Federal employee or contractor who 
provides proof of COVID–19 antibodies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support my legislation and provide our 
workers with a smart, science-based al-
ternative to President Biden’s vaccine 
mandate. 
f 
CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE 
FACE OF DISASTERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
over this past week, it has been heart-
ening to see the climate pledges and 
vows coming out of Glasgow. Our suc-
cess in Glasgow, however, will not 
come from voluntary pledges and vows. 
It must include specific, effective steps 
that can be put in place now to begin 
making a difference. 
I have worked on the climate issue 
since 1991 when I was a member of the 
city council that enacted the Nation’s 
first carbon commitments which we 
have met over those years. But the cas-
cade of recent extraordinary weather 
events has made it clear—as if we need-
ed further reminders—that we are en-
tering a new era in terms of impact and 
public awareness of climate disasters. 
The Oregon experience has been sear-
ing. We had the worst air quality in the 
world last year due to extreme forest 
fires. And in my district when we set 
an all-time heat record of 116 degrees 
this summer after setting two other 
previous all-time highs, we recorded 
temperatures of 180 degrees in the 
heart of my district. No wonder hun-
dreds of people died. 
Working on these issues for years, we 
have had some successes, but we can no 
longer afford to be nibbling around the 
edges. We need bold, transformative ac-
tion to meet the scale of this problem. 
We must continue to fight to reduce 
emissions and improve our resilience 
by passing the Build Back Better Act 
and the bipartisan infrastructure bill 
together. 
But as we undertake that enormous 
effort, we must also undertake the 
massive issues of community prepared-
ness, resilience, and risk mitigation. 
We can start with some of the basics: 
stop allowing new development in 
risky places like the fire zone, the 
urban-rural interface, or areas with 
high flood risk. We must deal with re-
petitive flood loss in a more thoughtful 
way, including paying to remove prop-
erties and people to ensure that the 
vulnerable aren’t stranded in high-risk 
areas. 
We must enhance the protections of 
the Stafford Act and help FEMA ad-
dress the challenges of today’s climate. 
FEMA does not actually have a man-
date to deal with the extreme heat like 
we had in Portland that was killing 
people. We must empower cities and 
States to be both proactive and real-
istic in their approaches to planning,

development, and hazard mitigation. 
We must radically approach our agri-
culture and deforestation to stop mak-
ing it worse. 
I have introduced legislation that 
would make it illegal for products that 
were grown on illegally deforested 
land—palm oil, soy, and cocoa—from 
entering the stream of commerce, and 
having a border adjustment tax will 
make a big difference to stop people 
from exporting their carbon pollution. 
Above all, we must mitigate climate 
change with an emphasis on equity, 
and we should harness the forces of na-
ture to heal the land and reduce car-
bon. It is more effective, and it is 
cheaper. Instead of putting off much- 
needed policy changes, this will only 
delay the inevitable and make the ad-
justments more difficult as we reap the 
consequences of decades of inaction 
and denial. 
Yes, it is going to take massive in-
vestments. But we are already making 
massive investments. The biggest in-
frastructure program now, the Federal 
Government, is paying to clean up 
after natural disasters. We should take 
some of that revenue stream and in-
stead invest in mitigation and recovery 
that will make us stronger going for-
ward. 
Over the past months, I have worked 
to try and assemble my thoughts, talk-
ing to experts and thinking about what 
would make a difference. I have a little 
report I call ‘‘From Ruin to Resilience: 
Protecting 
Communities 
and 
Pre-
venting Disaster.’’ I look forward to 
discussing this with my colleagues to 
understand their issues and things that 
we can do together on a scale that this 
challenge demands. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to 
progress and discussion in Glasgow, 
but, more importantly, I look forward 
to progress and action here in Congress 
and in our communities. Our future 
and our children’s future depend on it.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION MIGRANT 
PAYMENT PROPOSAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, my 
fellow Hoosier, I rise today to expose 
an outrageous scheme by the Biden ad-
ministration to pay out hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to migrants who 
have violated our laws by illegally 
crossing our southern border. 
Right now, there is already a na-
tional 
security, 
humanitarian, 
and 
public health crisis on the southern 
border. Every neighborhood in Amer-
ica, including mine in Indiana, is fac-
ing the devastating consequences of 
this crisis as illicit drugs come across 
the porous border and wreak havoc in 
our communities through more vio-
lence and drug overdoses. 
Instead of protecting our country by 
securing the border, President Biden 
wants law-abiding American taxpayers 
to pay illegal migrants, whom people 
know and we know broke the laws, a ri-
diculous sum of money. This decision 
will do nothing more than encourage 
human trafficking and drug smuggling. 
The administration’s border policies 
are downright inhumane and will con-
tinue to incentivize migrants to make 
the dangerous journey to reach our 
border. 
This radical proposal should be aban-
doned immediately. It will not only ex-
acerbate this crisis but it will also be 
put on the taxpayers’ dime. 
As inflation skyrockets under the 
Biden administration’s Big Govern-
ment giveaways, working families are 
struggling right now to pay for every-
day necessities. Small businesses are 
struggling with supply chain and work-
force shortages. 
While Americans face these obsta-
cles, President Biden has decided that 
rewarding people who break our laws is 
more important than fighting infla-
tion, securing our border, or ensuring 
that we have the necessary energy to 
heat our homes this winter. 
This is Big Government insanity at 
its worst, and I wholeheartedly reject 
it. 
f 
HOUSING IS A BASIC RIGHT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of millions of individ-
uals across our country who rely on 
public housing to keep a roof over their 
heads and for millions who need access 
to safe, stable, and affordable housing 
across our country. 
Housing is a basic right and the foun-
dation on which we build our lives and 
our families, and though it is clear 
that this is essential, far too many 
Americans struggle to keep a safe roof 
over their heads. In fact, homelessness 
is now at epidemic levels across our 
country. Particularly in our urban cit-
ies, families are homeless. Children, 
women, 
seniors, 
and 
veterans 
are 
homeless. 
When we speak of the Build Back 
Better program and our agenda, we 
speak of introducing the importance of 
prioritizing the most at-risk commu-
nities. This is whom we are focusing on 
in the Build Back Better agenda, the 
most at-risk communities in our coun-
try. We speak of equitable access to the 
basic needs of the American people. 
That is what we speak about when we 
speak about Build Back Better. 
We have included provisions that en-
sure children in need have access to 
free school lunches. We have worked to 
expand Medicare benefits for seniors. 
We have fought to include and boost 
the child tax credit, which will provide 
families with much-needed financial 
health, lifting children, Mr. Speaker, 
out of poverty. We have included his-
toric provisions that will be better for 
our Nation for years to come. 
But today, Mr. Speaker, I want to 
focus on the significant investments 
the Build Back Better Act secures for 
public and affordable housing needs. 
b 1100 
The Build Back Better Act will make 
the single largest, most comprehensive 
investment in affordable housing in our 
entire history. Over $150 billion for 
housing is an enormous investment to-
ward solving our pressing housing chal-
lenges and needs across the country. 
Importantly, this bill includes bil-
lions to expand rental assistance, $24 
billion for new housing vouchers, and 
as we know, Mr. Speaker, many people 
are backed up on their rent. But in ad-
dition to that, Mr. Speaker, $65 billion 
to address public housing repair back-
log for 2.5 million residents, a signifi-
cant resource for the National Housing 
Trust Fund to build and preserve thou-
sands of homes for low-income families 
who are disproportionately people of 
color. 
This is a major investment, an un-
precedented investment in housing in 
my district, which has the largest 
stock in the New York City Housing 
Authority of public housing, and it has 
the highest number of rent-stabilized 
apartments, and the city of New York 
will benefit greatly. 
Due to the COVID–19 global crisis, we 
are on the brink of a housing crisis, 
Mr. Speaker, an eviction tsunami, and 
up to 40 million people in America are 
at risk of being displaced. This crisis is 
here, and we want to act on it right 
now. It will take generations for our 
Nation to recover. 
Plus, we are now experiencing a 
shortage of 7 million affordable homes 
for working-class and low-income fami-
lies nationwide. For every 10 house-
holds in need, Mr. Speaker, there are 
fewer than four affordable, available 
homes. Not a single city, State, or dis-
trict, has enough housing to meet 
these dire demands. And even when 
housing is available, it may not nec-
essarily mean that housing is safe. 
My district has the largest con-
centration of public housing and it has, 
as I said earlier, the highest number of 
rent-stabilized 
apartments 
in 
New 
York City. Yet, they lack the critical 
resources needed to create habitable 
living. This is a great investment, Mr. 
Speaker. The Build Back Better pro-
gram is an immense investment in 
housing.

HONORING JOHN ONDRASIK OF 
FIVE FOR FIGHTING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize an individual I 
recently had the pleasure of having a 
conversation with, a singer-songwriter 
who, more importantly, is a tremen-
dous supporter of our troops, John 
Ondrasik of Five for Fighting. 
John started Five for Fighting in 
1995, and shortly thereafter rose to

November 4, 2021 
fame after releasing the Grammy-nom-
inated ballad ‘‘Superman’’. While writ-
ten and released well before 9/11, ‘‘Su-
perman’’ became something of an an-
them during the tough days following 
9/11. 
As our Nation came together as one, 
‘‘Superman’’ struck a chord with the 
survivors and families of those we lost 
on that terrible day, as well as our 
troops serving around the world. And 
its lyrics resonated with people and 
comforted those who needed it the 
most. 
Mr. Speaker, since then, John has 
been deeply involved with our troops. 
He has performed at dozens of USO 
shows for our servicemembers overseas 
and also works with several veteran- 
oriented charities. John has spent the 
past two decades writing deeply per-
sonal songs that include social mes-
sages that make an emotional connec-
tion and invoke the human spirit. 
Some of these songs are included on 
the ‘‘CD for the Troops’’ project which 
is a collection of 13 songs from top art-
ists, including John’s, that was com-
piled specially for U.S. military mem-
bers. 
Since 2007, John has distributed over 
1 million copies of ‘‘CD for the Troops’’ 
to servicemembers and their families 
around the world as a way of thanking 
them for the sacrifices that they have 
made and continue to make. 
John’s support of the U.S. Armed 
Forces is unwavering and, like many of 
us, when he saw the devastating im-
ages coming out of Afghanistan during 
the onset of the U.S. withdrawal in Au-
gust, he was horrified. Terrified moth-
ers were throwing their babies over 
barbed wire fences and men were 
clinging on to military aircraft as they 
lifted off, all in an attempt to flee the 
Taliban. How could this be happening? 
John then did what many musicians 
in pain do. He sat at his piano and he 
wrote a song. He penned ‘‘Blood on My 
Hands’’ which is a song that mourns 
the Americans who died and the ones 
who were left behind in Afghanistan 
due to the failures of the administra-
tion. ‘‘Blood on My Hands’’ encap-
sulates the emotions that I and many 
Americans felt following the terrorist 
attacks in Kabul that killed 13 U.S. 
servicemembers and dozens of Afghani 
allies. Similar to ‘‘Superman’s’’ effect 
on people post-9/11, ‘‘Blood on My 
Hands’’ went viral and quickly became 
an anthem for veterans and service-
members in the wake of the deadly at-
tacks in Kabul. 
Mr. Speaker, many people cautioned 
John not to release the song. Still, he 
kept coming back to the idea that this 
song sent an important moral message 
about the disastrous withdrawal from 
Afghanistan. John says of ‘‘Blood on 
My Hands’’: ‘‘It’s not a political song. 
It is a moral message about promises 
that we made to people there, that we 
promised to protect, that we left there. 
We broke our promise. It’s about ac-
countability and admitting when you 
make mistakes because that’s how you 
can rectify them and learn not to do 
them again.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more 
with this sentiment. What happened to 
no person left behind? We put Amer-
ican citizens, SIV holders, and Afghan 
allies’ lives at risk. The United States 
of America and this administration 
broke that promise to these people. 
The administration’s decisions sur-
rounding the withdrawal will go down, 
I believe, as one of the worst foreign 
policy decisions in American history. 
As a result, American lives were need-
lessly lost. 
It is time our leaders reflect on the 
mistakes that were made and take ac-
countability for failures so that we can 
do better for the American people and 
our allies in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, John’s work is evidence 
of the power that music holds. It brings 
people from different corners of the 
world together. It transcends time, and 
I am confident that John’s song, 
‘‘Blood on My Hands’’, will do just 
that. 
We will never forget 9/11 and, in the 
same vein, we can never forget the he-
roes who fought in the subsequent 20- 
year war in Afghanistan. Thanks to 
brave storytellers like John Ondrasik, 
we won’t forget these heroes. 
Mr. Speaker, John is a true patriot, 
and I applaud and admire his courage 
to stand up for what he believes in, and 
even more so, demand accountability 
from our Nation’s leaders.

LINCOLN BEACH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, let me paint a picture. It is 
the east side of New Orleans in 1959. A 
Black man at a swimming pool jumps 
off the high dive, arched in the sky. 
Fellow swimmers and passersby watch 
him from the shade of a palm tree. A 
Ferris wheel turns at the amusement 
park, and families picnic on the sandy 
shore of Lake Pontchartrain. 
That is what Lincoln Beach was like 
in its heyday: a beach, amusement 
park, performance area, and pool for 
the Black community of New Orleans 
who were not allowed at the all-White 
swimming pools in the area. 
Growing up, my community had fond 
memories of Lincoln Beach, as it was 
in the process of shutting down after 
courts decreed a racial nondiscrimina-
tion policy for private facilities on 
public lands, desegregating the all- 
White pools. 
Since its closure in the sixties, Lin-
coln Beach has fallen into decline. It 
was a site for picnics and outings. 
Without any maintenance, and over 
the decades, mountains of debris have 
piled up. This historic site, where so 
many Black kids and families built 
communities in New Orleans East, was 
fenced off and forgotten to many, but 
not to everyone. 
During 
COVID–19, 
some 
inspiring 
local activists and community mem-
bers including Sage, Reggie, and Bliss, 
took it upon themselves to take the 
first steps toward reopening historic 
Lincoln Beach. They got into some 
good trouble and cleaned up the beach 
all by themselves, spending their own 
resources, time, energy, and money. 
All on their own time, their own 
dime, they removed hundreds of bags of 
garbage and debris. About 3 tons of 
refuse was removed by these good- 
doing volunteers. After Hurricane Ida, 
they are facing some setbacks once 
again with flooding that floated the 
more than a year’s worth of trash col-
lection away. However, these com-
mitted activists are already back to 
work, cleaning up the beach and trying 
to remove obstacles to the future of 
what can be a revitalized, renewed Lin-
coln Beach. 
After Hurricane Katrina, the pri-
marily Black community of New Orle-
ans East repopulated essentially at the 
same rate as the city of New Orleans, 
but businesses did not come back at 
the same strength. Many of the major 
commercial areas are full of vacant 
businesses in this thriving, rich, strong 
community of New Orleans East. The 
once-popular mall was razed instead of 
being rebuilt. 
In 2019, a report said that 19 percent 
of the homes are vacant. Reopening a 
beautiful beach on the shores of Lake 
Pontchartrain could be a catalyst that 
will attract a renaissance of economic 
development in a community that has 
historically 
been 
underserved 
and 
should have equitable investments. 
One of the most important things a 
Member of Congress can do is to fight 
for allocations to fund projects for de-
velopment to improve the lives of the 
constituents in a particular area, like 
New Orleans East. This is an equity 
issue. This is a racial issue. This is an 
issue of economic development. This is 
an environmental issue and a recre-
ation issue. 
Lincoln Beach has a rich history, im-
portant cultural significance, and a 
huge potential for the future of this 
great community. I support the efforts 
of the city of New Orleans to direct 
RESTORE 
Act 
funds 
toward 
the 
project and today, I reaffirm my com-
mitment to support the renewal of Lin-
coln Beach in any way possible from 
Congress, State, and local resources. 
I came to Congress to fight for the 
people of the Second Congressional 
District, to fight for good jobs, healthy 
communities, equity and opportunities. 
One way to achieve this fight is for us 
to revitalize New Orleans East and to 
bring Lincoln Beach back to its full 
luster and beauty for the community 
to enjoy, to use as a catalyst for fur-
ther economic development, to show 
what revitalization and community ef-
forts, joining with Federal, local, and 
State resources, can do. 
We can and we will do better. The 
people of New Orleans, the people of 
Louisiana certainly deserve it, and we 
will fight to continue to bring those re-
sources to bear.

November 4, 2021 
BORDER CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. GUEST) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, West Vir-
ginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, 
Montana, 
Rhode 
Island, 
Delaware, 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, 
Vermont, and Wyoming. During Presi-
dent Biden’s first year in office, the 
number of illegal immigrants that the 
Border Patrol has encountered on our 
southern border has surpassed the pop-
ulation of these 12 States and the end 
is nowhere in sight. 
I am not sure if the Biden adminis-
tration knew that their policies would 
lead to the number of illegal immi-
grants surpassing the population of 
over 20 percent of U.S. States, but by 
reversing the successful policies of the 
previous administration, they have cre-
ated this crisis. 
This administration has listened to 
special interest groups over the will of 
the American people. This administra-
tion has implemented catch-and-re-
lease policies. This administration has 
canceled the remain in Mexico policy, 
and on his very first day in office, 
President Biden issued an executive 
order ending border wall funding. 
This administration has turned their 
back on every State of the Union to 
pursue a far-left agenda. This adminis-
tration has created a new State of 
chaos in our Nation with their failed 
policies. It is time for us to reverse 
course and to return to commonsense 
policies that work and that protect our 
Nation’s borders. 
b 1115 
REMEMBERING OUR VETERANS 
Mr. GUEST. Former President Ron-
ald Reagan once said: ‘‘Veterans know 
better than anyone else the price of 
freedom, for they’ve suffered the scars 
of war. We can offer them no better 
tribute than to protect what they have 
won for us.’’ 
Today, we remember the service of 
our veterans, the price they have paid 
and the Nation that they helped build 
and fought to protect. 
We know that America’s veterans 
risked their lives on the field of battle 
to preserve this Nation and the ideals 
of democracy, liberty, and freedom. 
But we must not forget that they not 
only fought to protect the rights that 
were established by our Founding Fa-
thers, but they also returned home to 
set an example of enduring patriotism 
and leadership in our communities, our 
States, and our Nation. 
When their service ended, our vet-
erans helped advance our country by 
embodying the American spirit of hard 
work and perseverance. 
Today, we thank them for the exam-
ple they set. 
This day, more than any other, let 
every American reach out to a veteran 
and say: Thank you for your service; 
we are grateful for your many sac-
rifices that you have made on behalf of 
our Nation. 
As we stand in this great institution 
of democracy that our veterans helped 
build and then fought to preserve, let 
our Nation remember the hundreds of 
thousands of men and women who 
fought for our freedoms, and let us al-
ways remember that our Nation would 
have been forgotten to history long ago 
if not for those men and women brave 
enough to protect it. 
May God bless our country, and may 
God bless our veterans.

HONORING LES HOUCK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a truly dedicated town-
ship official from Pennsylvania’s 11th 
Congressional District, which I am 
honored to represent. 
Mr. Les Houck, of Salisbury Town-
ship, in eastern Lancaster County, is 
retiring as a member of the Salisbury 
Township Board of Supervisors after 48 
years of dedicated service in that body; 
almost a half a century. 
In fact, his service to the township 
began 2 years prior to his 48 years as a 
supervisor, in 1972, when he was ap-
pointed to the township’s planning 
commission. 
Les is a wonderful husband and fa-
ther as well, but as I said, he has dedi-
cated half a century working to im-
prove his community. Over the years, 
Les has become a trusted voice who is 
sought out for counsel in Lancaster 
County and across the Commonwealth 
as well. 
Beyond his service to the residents of 
Salisbury Township, Les served on sev-
eral boards for Lancaster County, on 
advisory committees to the Governor 
and other State departments, and in 
leadership roles with both the county 
and State associations of township su-
pervisors. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend 
my sincere thanks to Les Houck for 50 
years of service to the residents of 
Salisbury Township and for being an 
outstanding and true example of serv-
ant leadership. 
CONGRATULATING EHD OF LANCASTER 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate EHD of Lan-
caster as they celebrate their business’ 
125th anniversary; truly an impressive 
milestone. 
The business, Engle-Hambright & Da-
vies, now known as EHD, dates back to 
1896 and has grown over the years, from 
previously working in real estate to 
now being a respected full-service in-
surance agency which employs 120 indi-
viduals with offices in Lancaster, Read-
ing, Exton, and Pittsburgh. 
They are one of only a few inde-
pendent 
insurance 
agencies 
who 
achieved the Best Practices distinction 
for 6 consecutive years from the Inde-
pendent Insurance Agents & Brokers of 
America. 
They continue to work to give back 
to the community they have called 
home for over a century, supporting a 
number of local nonprofit organiza-
tions through their many charitable ef-
forts. 
Mr. Speaker, the American entrepre-
neurial spirit has led to the founding of 
many businesses. Some do well, some 
fail, but not many have lasted for 125 
years. That is rare. 
Today, I want to mention EHD. We 
celebrate with them. We congratulate 
them on achieving this milestone, and 
we wish them continued success.

SUPPORTING THE SECOND 
AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, President Biden and the Democrats 
want to defund the police, take away 
your Second Amendment right to self- 
defense, and then stand by and watch 
crime skyrocket in cities like Chicago. 
The new push by the left, intended to 
diminish 
your 
Second 
Amendment 
rights, is to pass so-called red-flag gun 
confiscation laws. 
This is a disguised attempt by Con-
gressional Democrats and some Repub-
licans to seize lawfully owned firearms 
and violate the Second Amendment 
rights of American citizens. 
Congressional Democrats and some 
Republicans voted to pass the National 
Defense Authorization Act, which in-
cludes red-flag gun confiscation provi-
sions. 
I urge the Senate to reject red-flag 
gun confiscation provisions in the 
NDAA. 
I will always stand up for the Second 
Amendment rights of my constituents. 
Shootings in Chicago are up 220 per-
cent due to the pro-crime policies of 
the left. Businesses and citizens are 
leaving Illinois at a record number. Of-
ficers are retiring from the Chicago po-
lice force at a record pace. 
Our Second Amendment right to de-
fend our home and family has never 
been more important. I will always 
stand up for the Constitution and for 
the safety of the people in Illinois.

DIVISIVE MERGER AT JOHNSON & 
JOHNSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, a jury in-
structed Johnson & Johnson to pay $5 
million in damages to Patricia, a re-
tired teacher with two children and 
four grandchildren. One month later, 
she died, at age 61, of mesothelioma, an 
aggressive form of cancer caused by as-
bestos exposure. 
Thirty-five-year-old Christina was a 
preschool teacher studying for her 
master’s degree when she was diag-
nosed with mesothelioma. In 2019, a 
jury awarded her $26 million in her 
case against Johnson & Johnson. 
Gail was 36 years old when she col-
lapsed on her kitchen floor. She was di-
agnosed with mesothelioma and has

November 4, 2021 
undergone six rounds of chemotherapy, 
radiation, and major surgeries. Two 
days into her 2019 trial, Johnson & 
Johnson struck a deal to pay her dam-
ages. 
These women, all Californians, are 
just a few of the now over 40,000 women 
who want Johnson & Johnson to help 
cover the millions of dollars in medical 
expenses they have racked up in their 
fight against cancer caused by asbestos 
exposure. 
Before we knew asbestos caused can-
cer, men who inhaled asbestos dust in 
mines and in industries like ship-
building got mesothelioma cancer. For 
decades, women who didn’t work in 
those jobs, but were diagnosed with 
mesothelioma, 
wondered 
how 
they 
could have been exposed. 
Like asbestos, talc is a naturally oc-
curring mineral that must be mined. 
During that process, talc can be con-
taminated by asbestos. 
The 40,000 women all diagnosed with 
asbestos-related cancers all used John-
son & Johnson baby powder for decades 
on their children and on themselves. 
The main ingredient? Talc. 
Johnson & Johnson sold its iconic 
baby powder for 60 years, despite their 
own internal documents showing that 
their executives, scientists, doctors, 
and lawyers all knew that some bottles 
were laced with asbestos. 
In 1976, Johnson & Johnson assured 
the FDA that no asbestos was ‘‘de-
tected in any sample’’ of talc produced 
between December 1972 and October 
1973. What it didn’t say, what it didn’t 
tell the regulator, was that at least 
three tests by three different labs 
found asbestos in the powder, in one 
case at levels reported as ‘‘rather 
high.’’ 
Internal 
documents 
confirm 
that 
Johnson & Johnson willfully misled 
consumers about the safety of its baby 
powder. 
In a memo to managers, a Johnson & 
Johnson executive explained that the 
company’s policy of countering nega-
tive research about the dangers of talc: 
‘‘Our current posture with respect to 
sponsorship of talc safety studies has 
been to initiate studies only as dic-
tated by confrontation.’’ ‘‘The prin-
cipal advantage for this operating phi-
losophy lies in the fact that we mini-
mize the risk of possible self-genera-
tion of scientific data which may be po-
litically 
or 
scientifically 
embar-
rassing.’’ 
In this 2013 markup of a statement 
for Johnson & Johnson’s website, you 
can see that Johnson & Johnson’s legal 
team advised the company against 
claiming that: ‘‘Our talc-based con-
sumer products have always been as-
bestos free,’’ with the comment: ‘‘We 
cannot say ‘always.’’’ They recognized 
that the company’s talc could have 
been contaminated in earlier times. 
Johnson & Johnson built its fortune 
on its baby powder. The company’s net 
worth is $440 billion, plenty of assets to 
help the women poisoned by their prod-
ucts. 
Three weeks ago, Johnson & Johnson 
formed a subsidiary called LTL Man-
agement. They then dumped all of 
their asbestos-related liabilities, in-
cluding those nearly 40,000 lawsuits, 
into that shell company. Two days 
later, LTL Management filed for bank-
ruptcy. 
This is corporate chicanery, cor-
porate abuse, because Johnson & John-
son only provided that shell company 
with $2 billion to cover tens of thou-
sands of asbestos-related lawsuits. Two 
billion dollars is a big number, but 
Johnson & Johnson knows the real 
damages they caused. In 2018, the com-
pany was ordered to pay $4.69 billion to 
22 women and their families who used 
baby powder. They know they did not 
put enough money into that entity, 
and they specifically created it to 
avoid liability. 
Corporations abusing our bankruptcy 
system is not new. Before I came to 
Congress, I did extensive research on 
these kinds of predatory, anti-con-
sumer tactics. 
Johnson & Johnson is abusing our 
legal system to shield its assets. This 
is an injustice and Congress must act.

NLRB CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, what is hap-
pening at the National Labor Relations 
Board, NLRB, is so rotten it stinks. 
Under 
Democrat 
leadership, 
the 
NLRB has a history of bias and over-
reach. President Biden fired the Sen-
ate-confirmed general counsel on his 
first day in office, and now the Biden 
board is dodging ethics rules. 
NLRB Democrats are refusing to fol-
low conflict of interest standards that 
were weaponized by Democrats during 
the Trump administration. This is bla-
tant hypocrisy and threatens the integ-
rity of the board. 
How can NLRB members Gwynne 
Wilcox and David Prouty be conscien-
tious arbiters on the very policies they 
fought against as union employees? 
And how can we expect board members 
with close ties to union activists to be 
unbiased when it comes to big labor 
cases? 
Is there anything NLRB Democrats 
won’t do to advance the interests of big 
labor at the expense of American work-
ers? It is a shame what it is doing.

MERITS OF TEXAS’ HEARTBEAT 
BILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, soon the 
Supreme Court will rule on the chal-
lenge to the Texas abortion law case. 
The 
law 
implements 
the 
Nation’s 
toughest restrictions on abortions. 
Signed into law by Governor Greg 
Abbott in May, it prohibits abortion 
after a heartbeat is detected in the un-
born child. This usually occurs around 
6 weeks. The law makes exceptions for 
medical emergencies. 
The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing 
challenges to this bill by pro-abortion 
groups that want the law overturned. 
The upcoming ruling will be closely 
watched as an indicator as to whether 
the Federal courts will uphold future 
States’ rights to implement pro-life 
legislation rather than continuing to 
overreach their Federal court author-
ity. 
Unborn babies are human lives. All 
too often, abortion is referred to as 
simply a medical procedure, and the 
sanctity of life is devalued. 
At 6 weeks, an unborn child has a 
heartbeat of approximately 98 beats per 
minute. Blood vessels begin to form in 
the circulatory system, and the brain 
is rapidly developing. This is a human 
life. 
By 10 weeks, an unborn baby has 
arms and legs, fingers and toes. The 
baby’s pain receptors have been devel-
oping for weeks. This is a human life. 
By 15 weeks, all the unborn baby’s 
major organs have formed, and the 
baby has a fully developed heart that 
pumps 26 quarts of blood per day. The 
baby can feel pain. 
All too often, these facts are over-
looked and sidelined and not even ad-
dressed in the issue of abortion. 
It is my hope that the U.S. Supreme 
Court will see the merits as to why the 
State of Texas heartbeat bill was im-
plemented. According to CDC statis-
tics, 619,591 babies were aborted in the 
United States in 2018. That is 619,591 
lives that could have been the next 
teacher, firefighter, parent, or Presi-
dent of the United States. Upholding 
the heartbeat bill would save the lives 
of countless unborn babies, both male 
and female. 
Here in Congress, I continue to be the 
protector of life and champion for the 
Hyde amendment in Federal legisla-
tion. Taxpayer money should not be 
used to end the lives of innocent, de-
fenseless babies with beating hearts. 
The right to life is our most funda-
mental, natural, and God-given right. I 
will continue to fight to oppose pro- 
abortion plans to force taxpayer fund-
ing for abortion. Your taxpayer dollars 
should never be used to be funding 
abortion on demand. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe in the sanctity 
of life, and I will continue to fight for 
the rights of preborn babies.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord Almighty, instruct us and teach 
us in the right way. You, whose plan is 
wonderful, whose wisdom is magnifi-
cent, grant us the knowledge we need 
to accomplish Your will this day. 
As high as the heavens are above the 
Earth, so are Your ways higher than 
our ways, Your thoughts higher than 
our own. 
Reach down and bestow on us the gift 
of Your wisdom. Draw near to us that 
we may know Your clarity in the 
things that confound us. 
Speak to us above all other voices, 
that we would hear Your counsel. Let 
us not boast of our own insight, nor of 
our strength or riches, but let us boast 
that we have the freedom to know You. 
Let us not serve the temptation to 
hurt, judge, or behave rudely, but let 
us serve You, the Lord, who exercises 
kindness, justice, and righteousness on 
the Earth. 
Then may You delight in our efforts 
to reveal that kindness, to exercise 
Your justice, and to demonstrate Your 
righteousness here in this place and in 
the living of our days. 
Your word will not return empty, but 
will accomplish what You desire and 
achieve the purpose for which You sent 
it. So send us forth this day to live into 
that word. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

Mr. RUTHERFORD led the Pledge of

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

REPLENISH THE RESTAURANT 
REVITALIZATION FUND 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to add my voice and 
support to restaurant owners in Buf-
falo and Western New York standing up 
today to call on Congress to approve 
additional restaurant relief. 
Congress authorized, through the 
American Rescue Plan, the Restaurant 
Revitalization Fund, providing $28.6 
billion to help restaurants hit hard by 
the pandemic. While the program was 
able to help over 101,000 small business 
owners, over 63 percent of eligible ap-
plicants, more than 177,000 restaurants 
the Small Business Administration 
deemed qualified for funding received 
nothing. 
According 
to 
the 
National 
Res-
taurant Association, the restaurant in-
dustry sales in 2020 were down by $240 
billion, and restaurant employment 
dropped 3 million below expected lev-
els. Restaurants support jobs, fuel our 
local economies, and as gathering 
places for families and friends, help to 
build stronger communities. 
Madam Speaker, I stand in strong 
support of swift replenishment of the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same.

CONGRATULATING NASHUA-PLAIN-
FIELD 
STUDENT 
CALEB 
SINNWELL 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Iowa’s Nash-
ua-Plainfield student Caleb Sinnwell. 
Caleb won first place in this year’s 
National History Day competition for 
his project on the Ghost Army, a World 
War II unit of 1,100 men tasked with de-
ceiving German intelligence. 
To recognize his outstanding work, 
Caleb is being awarded the Certificate 
of Achievement by the U.S. Special 
Forces Army Unit. 
Caleb’s 
thesis 
states 
in 
part: 
‘‘Through 
masterful 
miscommunication, the Ghost Army 
successfully deceived German troops, 
which aided Allied advancement to vic-
tory in World War II.’’ 
He is now asking Congress to pass the 
Ghost Army Congressional Gold Medal 
Act, a bill to recognize the critically 
important work of the Ghost Army 
during World War II. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to 
support this effort, and I am hoping my 
colleagues in the Senate will take up 
this measure very soon. 
Keep up the great work, Caleb.

LIBERTY BAPTIST CHURCH 
CELEBRATES 150TH ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize Liberty Baptist Church located in 
Blanchard, Pennsylvania. This week-
end, Liberty Baptist Church is cele-
brating a major milestone, their 150th 
anniversary. 
What started with very humble be-
ginnings at an abandoned German re-
form church in 1871, what started there 
has now blossomed into a vibrant con-
gregation and community staple. 
In 1872, Brother Runyon, the pastor 
at the time, described the congregation 
in a simple sentence: ‘‘Wealth we have 
not, but warm hearts and willing hands 
we have.’’ 
Those words ring true today. With 
warm hearts and willing hands, Liberty 
Baptist Church continues to give back 
to the community, whether it is a bake 
sale or potlucks to backpack min-
istries, Christmas caroling, and youth 
sports, the congregation at Liberty 
Baptist Church is happy to lend a help-
ing hand. 
Over the past 150 years, there were 
challenging times as well as times of 
great joy. It is clear, God shines on 
your members, your church leadership, 
and your pastors. 
Congratulations on this monumental 
anniversary. May God continue to bless 
you all for the next 150 years.

RECOGNIZING ANTHE NIJZIEL 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
young woman from my district for 
making University of Iowa and Big Ten 
sports history. 
Recently, University of Iowa field 
hockey star Anthe Nijziel was awarded 
both Big Ten Co-Player of the Year and 
Defensive Player of the Year honors 
after leading the Hawkeyes to an im-
pressive 16–1 regular season. 
Though each of these honors are an 
impressive feat on their own, Anthe 
has raised the bar, becoming the first 
Iowa student athlete to win both 
awards in the same season and the 
third person in Big Ten history to win 
the Player of the Year title in more 
than one season. 
I congratulate the entire Iowa field 
hockey team for a great season, and 
Head Coach Lisa Cellucci, who was 
unanimously named Big Ten Coach of 
the Year after being awarded Co-Coach 
of the Year last season. 
Congratulations 
to 
Anthe, 
Coach 
Cellucci, and the rest of the Iowa field 
hockey team, and good luck as you 
head into the Big Ten tournament.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6192 
November 4, 2021 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to raise alarm on the tax-and- 
spending spree Democrats are trying to 
rush through Congress. 
The bill is over 1,500 pages and has 
not even received a score from the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office. 
They want to vote on this bill without 
knowing how much it will cost tax-
payers. What kind of policies are House 
Democrats trying to hide from the 
American people? 
Union handouts, billions of dollars to 
grant amnesty to illegal immigrants, 
and over $400 billion in small business 
tax hikes; these are just a few of the 
bad policies tucked away in this bill. 
This is not what the American people 
want. 
House Democrats should read their 
own bill and explain to the American 
people exactly how they are spending 
their tax dollars. 
f 
UNIVERSAL PRE-K 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
this could be a very black week for 
America in that there are rumors that 
the reconciliation bill will pass. A lot 
of bad provisions are in there that are 
bad for the economy, bad for the dollar. 
But I think the one that is going to 
have the longest impact is the uni-
versal three- and four-year-old pre-K 
expenditure. 
In America, traditionally, the family 
has been in charge of raising the chil-
dren, but as is obvious from groups 
that helped the Democrats retain the 
majority last time, there are people 
who don’t like the nuclear family and 
would rather have the government 
raise their children. To have the gov-
ernment involved in universal pre-K 
will permanently reduce the impact 
that American families have on their 
children and permanently increase the 
ability of the government to instill all 
of their frequently anti-Christian val-
ues on the various young children. 
I think in the long run, when we look 
back on this week and the damage that 
it has done to America, we will look at 
the universal three- and four-year-old 
pre-K provision as something that did 
more to drag down America than any-
thing else. 
f 
MORE GOVERNMENT, LESS 
FREEDOM 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, there is a major disconnect 
between political elites here within the 
Washington beltway and the hard-
working Americans that live beyond it. 
The American people in Virginia 
spoke loud and clear Tuesday. Those 
serving in this building and at 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue would be wise to 
listen. 
Americans want less government in 
their lives, not more. They are sick of 
mandates. They are tired of being 
called racist. They are worried about 
the increasing lawlessness in our cities. 
They are angry their fellow Ameri-
cans were left behind in Afghanistan. 
They are frustrated that more of their 
paychecks are being taken from them 
at the gas pump and the grocery store. 
And they distrust a media that arro-
gantly dismisses their concern. 
They are facing a bleak holiday, a 
cold, expensive winter, and a down- 
sized American Dream. And they know 
full well the bigger Washington gets 
and the more it spends, the less free-
dom they have. 
The President’s agenda isn’t about 
protecting the climate, providing vac-
cines, healthcare, or education funding. 
It is about control. And the American 
people are seeing through it. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER—AN 
AMERICAN PLAN 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. The President is trying 
to help America, help the middle class, 
help the forgotten. 
The Build Back Better bill will give 
people childcare that they need and 
women to go to work. It will give a 
child tax credit and make it perma-
nent, lifting half the children in this 
country out of poverty. It will give el-
derly people who are infirm and need to 
be at home elderly in-home care so 
they can stay in their homes. That is 
wonderful for those people, something 
they need. 
It will provide for family and medical 
leave, something every other industrial 
country in the world has. It will put 
$500 billion in unbelievable investment 
in the future of our planet, on climate 
controls, and credits for folks to go 
into renewables and solar and heat, 
wind-powered energy, and improving 
the electrical grid. 
It will do many wonderful things, and 
it is all paid for. And the only Ameri-
cans paying more in taxes are those 
making $10 million and above, they 
will pay a surtax. 
Madam Speaker, it is a great plan. It 
is an American plan. It should be a bi-
partisan plan. And I am for it. Thank 
you, President Biden. 
f 
BUILD BACK BROKE PLAN 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, today, there is a discussion 
going on as to whether or not we 
should be voting on the build back 
broke plan that is being proposed by 
the Democrats. 
I have asked for a score from the 
Congressional Budget Office to find out 
what is actually in this bill and what it 
is going to cost American taxpayers. 
We have heard the phrase before, ‘‘we 
will vote on it and then you can find 
out what is in it.’’ But the reality is 
that Members of Congress don’t even 
know what is in this reconciliation 
package that is being presented. 
How in good conscience could we ac-
tually pass something that is going to 
be fiscally damaging to the country 
and putting the cost of it on the backs 
of hardworking taxpayers across this 
country? We need to know what is in 
this reconciliation package that is 
being proposed. 
I ask for Speaker PELOSI to request a 
CBO score, and that this bill be voted 
on after that is presented to the Mem-
bers of Congress.

TERRORIST WAR CONTINUES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, with the Biden sur-
render to terrorists in Afghanistan 
claiming the war is over, events sadly 
reveal this is not true. 
As Biden disgracefully left Ameri-
cans behind in Afghanistan while 13 
Marines were murdered, there have 
been further attacks. In New Zealand, 
a jihadist stabbed six shoppers. In Nor-
way, with bow and arrow, a terrorist 
killed five people and injured three. In 
the 
U.K., 
Parliamentarian 
David 
Amess was assassinated. Across Af-
ghanistan, mosques were bombed, kill-
ing and wounding hundreds as the ter-
rorists practice to bomb houses of wor-
ship in America. 
Sadly, 
the 
biased 
establishment 
media covered for Biden and concealed 
the ISIS bomb attack in Uganda on Oc-
tober 24, killing a waitress in Kampala. 
Shamefully, the media intentionally 
ignore the atrocities across Afghani-
stan and fail to report terrorist attacks 
worldwide as American families are at 
risk of suicide bombers. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from Afghanistan to 
America.

PAYMENT OF $450,000 TO ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to talk about the Biden 
border crisis, which continues to rage 
every single day. For months, the 
Biden administration has had no an-
swer for the hundreds of thousands of 
illegal immigrants who have streamed 
across our southern border. 
Now we have learned that the Presi-
dent is actually considering a payment

of $450,000 to illegal immigrants who 
were arrested during the previous ad-
ministration. 
How on Earth is this acceptable in 
the United States of America? What 
has happened to our basic under-
standing of the rule of law? I refuse to 
allow a half-million-dollar handout of 
hardworking 
taxpayers’ 
money 
to 
those who came here illegally. 
That is why I am proud to support 
the Illegal Immigrant Payoff Prohibi-
tion Act, introduced by Congressman 
MCCLINTOCK, which would prevent the 
attorney general from making these 
payments. 
It is very simple: illegal immigrants 
should not be rewarded for breaking 
the law. 
f 
MADE IN AMERICA TAX 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, President Reagan said it: The 
government’s idea on the economy is 
when it is moving, you tax it; if it 
keeps moving, you regulate it; when it 
fails, you subsidize it. 
If the government would stop taxing 
and regulating, we wouldn’t need the 
subsidizing. The Democrats are the 
champions of Big Government because 
they would rather gain power through 
taxes and regulations than see our 
economy actually grow. That is what 
their tax-and-spend agenda is all about, 
it is power. 
Today, the Biden economic crisis is 
raging, yet President Biden and Speak-
er PELOSI
are pushing the made in 
America tax that will only aggravate 
the crisis facing all of America. The 
made in America tax policy will drive 
up taxes on U.S. firms and workers 
both at home and in every country 
they do business in around the world. 
This bill would also create a com-
plex, parallel tax system that punishes 
investment in American production, 
permanently stop key domestic min-
eral development, and allow China to 
continue to have a monopoly on crit-
ical mineral markets. 
The Democrats’ made-in-America tax 
would give more power to Washington, 
but make it better for a foreign com-
pany or a foreign worker than for an 
American worker. 
We need leaders in Washington who 
will put Americans first.

Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Ms. Amanda M. Grandjean, 
Esq., Director of Elections and Deputy As-
sistant Secretary of State, Ohio Office of the 
Secretary of State, indicating that, accord-
ing to the unofficial results of the Special

vember 2, 2021, the Honorable Shontel M. 
Brown was elected Representative to Con-
gress for the Eleventh Congressional Dis-
trict, State of Ohio, and the Honorable Mike

FRANK LAROSE, 
OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE, 
November 3, 2021. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This letter is to inform 
you of the unofficial election results from 
the Special Congressional General Election 
for the unexpired terms in the 11th and 15th 
Congressional Districts of Ohio. The results 
of the Unofficial Canvass accompany this 
letter. Please note that results are unofficial 
until the most populous county in each dis-
trict certifies the official results of the elec-
tion. The Unofficial Canvass does not include 
a count of qualifying provisional ballots or 
absentee ballots postmarked the day before 
Election Day, but not received by dose of 
polls. 
As noted in the unofficial results from the 
most populous county accompanying this 
letter, Shontel Brown received the highest

the unofficial results from the most populous 
county

this 
letter, 
Mike

in the 15th Congressional District of Ohio. Of 
course, these results are unofficial until 
after the Official Canvass of the election is 
complete and a Certificate of Election is 
issued. 
The Official Canvass will be completed 
three weeks after the conclusion of the elec-
tion, no later than November 23, 2021. A re-
count can only be requested, or a challenge 
filed after the Official Canvass is completed. 
Once the most populous county in each dis-
trict certifies the official results, our Office 
will inform you of the official results and 
any anticipated recount or challenge. Sec-
retary LaRose will then issue the Certifi-
cates of Election on December 2, 2021. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
the Elections Division at (614) 466–2585. 
Sincerely, 
AMANDA M. GRANDJEAN, ESQ., 
Director of Elections and Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6197 
November 4, 2021 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
SHONTEL BROWN TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAP-
TUR) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, today 
we welcome Representative SHONTEL 
BROWN
of Ohio’s 11th Congressional 
District to the Halls of Congress, 
America’s temple of democracy. 
Representative BROWN’s Great Lakes, 
northern Ohio, Cleveland region has 
weathered enormous challenges over 
the years. Now more than ever her in-
telligent, innovative, personable, and 
collaborative leadership are needed. 
Representative BROWN has a remark-
able record of such accomplishments. 
She follows in the footsteps of former 
Congresswoman and now HUD Sec-
retary Marcia Fudge, Representative 
Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and Represent-
ative 
Louis 
Stokes. Representative 
BROWN will now become the 58th mem-
ber of the Black Caucus, an historic 
high for our Nation. 
First, as a Warrensville Heights City 
Council member, and then as a Cuya-
hoga County Council member, Rep-
resentative BROWN has driven progress 
through investments in infrastructure, 
health and human services, and edu-
cation 
at 
every 
juncture 
to 
help 
incentivize good-paying jobs. 
SHONTEL knows well how important 
it is for Federal and local governments 
working with the private sector to 
partner together to improve quality of 
life and increase opportunity, equity, 
and justice for all. 
Her relationships across northeast 
Ohio are very deep. Her commitment to 
serving greater Cleveland and Akron is 
dynamic and purposeful. 
Ohio’s Buckeye State congressional 
delegation is honored to welcome spar-
kling Representative SHONTEL BROWN. 
We stand ready to work with her to de-
liver results for Ohio and for the Amer-
ican people. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Congresswoman KAPTUR for 
her kind introduction. 
I rise as the newest Representative 
for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District. 
First, I thank my family, including 
my mom and dad; my siblings, Ray and 
Nick; my nieces and nephews; aunts; 
uncles; cousins; and a special birthday 
shout-out to my cousin, Stephanie. I 
am guessing this is the best birthday 
present she has ever received. 
I also thank my friends Azuree, Lisa, 
and Kelly, and their parents; my team; 
and all of my incredible supporters who 
helped me along the way. 
But most importantly, I thank the 
great people of my district for placing 
their trust in me. 
I am humbled and honored to have 
the privilege of serving you, the people 
of Ohio’s 11th Congressional District, 
in the House of Representatives. I take 
this responsibility seriously. 
I ran for Congress because I believe 
in the resilience of the community I 
love and call home; because I believe 
that public service is always about put-
ting the people first; because I believe 
that now, with the eyes of history upon 
us, it is time to build a more just and 
more equitable future. These are the 
values I promise to hold close every 
day as I make your voice heard in Con-
gress. 
I enter these hallowed Halls on the 
shoulders of my predecessors, leaders 
like 
Louis 
Stokes; 
Congresswoman 
Stephanie Tubbs Jones; and my mentor 
and my friend, HUD Secretary Marcia 
Fudge. I vow to do the same work that 
she did as I vow to work for the people 
and be a voice of the people. 
As a proud Clevelander, I know that 
we are strong and that our work is to 
emerge from the pandemic stronger 
than ever. Our work is to rebuild an 
economy that puts the dignity of work-
ing people first, to protect the most 
vulnerable among us, to ensure every 
child has access to quality public edu-
cation, to fight for a day when every 
person has a roof over their head and 
food on their plate, to protect the right 
to vote, and to tackle the other great 
challenges of our time. 
I cannot wait to get to work with my 
colleagues in Congress to deliver re-
sults for the people of northeast Ohio 
and this great country.

WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
MIKE CAREY TO THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAP-
TUR) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
KAPTUR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, we have the additional distinct 
pleasure of welcoming Representative 
MIKE CAREY of Sabina, Ohio, to the 
117th Congress and to Ohio’s Buckeye 
State congressional delegation. 
Ohio is truly the industrial heartland 
of America, and the 15th Congressional 
District embodies our region’s aspira-
tions and struggles. 
The hardworking men and women of 
south central Ohio hold high hopes. 
They have sent Representative MIKE 
CAREY to advance progress for Ohio and 
America. We know he will champion 
the cause of workers and families so all 
can succeed. 
We all can imagine how very proud 
his family and friends are at this unfor-
gettable moment. 
From 
assuring 
America’s 
energy 
independence and deploying broadband 
internet, 
to 
rebuilding 
our 
roads, 
bridges, and power grid, Representative 
MIKE CAREY will bring his experience 
to bear with the energy industry to 
move Ohio and America forward and 
secure good-paying jobs for the middle 
class. 
All of us here today are excited to 
welcome 
determined, 
dogged 
Rep-
resentative MIKE CAREY and to get to 
work delivering new prosperity across 
our great State and Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CAREY. Madam Speaker, first, I 
am humbled to stand here today to 
serve in the people’s House as a prod-
uct of the small town of Sabina, Ohio. 
I thank my family: my wonderful 
wife, Meghan, who is home with our 
young son Conrad while we are pre-
paring to welcome a new son into the 
world in just a couple of weeks; also, 
my incredible son Prescott; my brother 
Chad; and my loving mother, Debra, 
who are all here today in the gallery. 
To the people of Ohio’s 15th District, 
from our smallest towns to our State 
capital in Columbus, I am truly hon-
ored that you have entrusted me with 
this solemn duty. Whether you work on 
a farm, own a small business, or are a 
large employer, I promise to fight for 
our district and to represent you all 
with dignity and respect. 
The problems facing our Nation 
today are great and consequential. 
Working families need this body to de-
liver solutions. Today, I am ready to 
work for the people of my district and 
for this great Nation. 
f

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE), the minority whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back to the majority leader to inquire 
as to the calendar for the remainder of 
this week—the bills that we just fin-
ished voting on, go through the rest of 
the bills that were on the schedule. 
Since there is no schedule that we see 
before us, if the majority leader could 
tell us what to expect next after this 
last vote. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for this opportunity to 
inform the Members of where we are. 
So many of us have been through this 
process before, and I know that every 
Member wants to have as much cer-
tainty about the schedule as possible. 
But, also, every Member understands 
that when we are at a period of time 
when we are trying to leave for a week 
and we have important legislation to 
do, that these events sometimes drag 
out. 
So the schedule is this: After the 
next vote we are going to break for din-
ner. Members will be on notice that 
they will receive a 1-hour notice if we 
are going to return. As the House 
knows, we are scheduled to meet to-
morrow as well, which we intend to do. 
So it is not unusual that we would go 
long before the last day, assuming that 
is the last day. 
I want everybody to get the ramifica-
tions of assuming that tomorrow is the 
last day. We want to get two major 
pieces of legislation done. They are 
controversial pieces of legislation, we 
know, but we want to get those done. 
We are working on that. The other side 
has 
gone 
through 
that 
experience 
themselves. 
Members should be on notice that we 
have an intention to break after this 
next vote for dinner, subject to an 
hour’s notice to be back here, with the 
expectation that there may well be 
votes this evening. We are hopeful that 
those votes would be sooner rather 
than later in terms of going late into 
the night. 
We will meet tomorrow at 9 o’clock 
and hope to complete the remainder of 
the business that was noted as possible 
for this week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. As we an-
ticipate possible votes tonight, possible 
votes tomorrow, the two major pieces 
of legislation that are still out there, 
and specifically the bill that went be-
fore the Rules Committee yesterday, 
roughly 2,500 pages. 
One of the things we talked about is, 
if that bill were to come to the floor, 
currently there is no Congressional 
Budget Office or Joint Committee on 
Taxation score on those bills, would 
there be a score on those bills prior to 
them coming to the floor for a vote? 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for the question, and 
then we will conclude. We hope to have 
not only a JCT score but also CBO 
scores. As the gentleman knows, the 
overwhelming majority of the bill has 
been pending for some time. Obviously, 
the CBO has been reviewing the indi-
vidual items for some time. We expect 
to have very close to most of the bill. 
It does not need a CBO score. It does 
need a CBO score, however, when it 
goes to the Senate, as the gentleman 
knows. That would be our intention, to 
have as much information available to 
Members as we have in hand. We do in-
tend to move forward with the bill. 
Mr. SCALISE. The JCT is obviously 
important, and I appreciate that the 
gentleman said there would be a JCT 
score, but on the CBO score, there have 
been some significant changes made in 
the Rules Committee since those CBO 
conversations. 
Would that be revised to include the 
new version of the bill? 
Mr. HOYER. We are working on that. 
We hope the CBO can accommodate 
that objective. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under

consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Robert Luis 
Santos, of Texas, to be Director of the 
Census for a term expiring December 
31, 2026. (Reappointment) 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we 
are now 4 weeks into the fiscal year. 
The Federal Government—the most 
powerful nation on Earth—is running 
on autopilot, and we only have 4 weeks 
until the government shuts down un-
less Congress takes action. 
And it is not a theoretical exercise. 
The actions we take, or don’t take, in 
this Chamber with respect to the fiscal 
year 2022 appropriations bills affect 
people’s lives and also the direction of 
this Nation. 
These bills provide for our national 
defense, help educate our Nation’s chil-
dren, provide medical care for our vet-
erans, ensure that we have clean air 
and water, invest in science, and pro-
vide a social safety net for our Nation’s 
most vulnerable populations. 
Now, we can, and we should, do our 
job and finish these bills in the coming 
weeks, and we should be ready to go. I 
mean, 2 weeks ago, I made public nine 
Senate appropriations bills. When you 
combine this with the three bills the 
Senate 
Appropriations 
Committee 
marked up way back in August, all 12 
bills have been released. The House has 
marked up all of their bills, and all but 
three of them have already passed the 
House. 
But in order to finish our work, we 
need to have an agreed-upon top line 
that has been worked out in a bipar-
tisan and bicameral basis—something 
that has been done so many times in 
the past. We can’t finalize bills until 
we know how much we are able to 
spend. And I have been calling for these 
negotiations for months. But we need 
all the party to come to the table. It 
takes both Republicans and Democrats 
to strike a deal. 
Now, Democrats have already made a 
fair offer. My Republican colleagues 
made clear to us that they believed the 
President’s proposal for a 1.7-percent 
increase for defense programs was inad-
equate. I thought it struck the right 
balance, as did many of my colleagues. 
But this institution is built on com-
promise. So in the Senate posted bill, I 
included a 5-percent increase for de-
fense instead of the 1.7 percent the ad-
ministration had proposed. The 5-per-
cent increase is based on the funding 
level included in the National Defense 
Authorization Act, NDAA. 
Now, the Senate Armed Services 
Committee voted on that. Do you know 
what the vote was?—25 to 1, in favor of 
that 5-percent increase. Every single 
Senate Republican on the Committee 
supported this level of funding. The 
House bill contains the same 5-percent 
increase, and it passed the House 
Chamber, 316 to 113. 
In order to increase the defense num-
ber and stay within the top line estab-
lished in the FY 2022 budget resolution, 
I reduced the amount for nondefense 
programs from President Biden’s pro-
posed 16-percent increase, which I 
would have preferred—but I reduced it 
to a 13-percent increase. That is how 
negotiations work. Each side has to 
give something. 
Now, having offered the Republican- 
endorsed spending level for defense, 
have they taken yes for an answer? 
No. 
Have 
they 
taken 
time 
for 
a 
counteroffer?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7764 
November 4, 2021 
No. 
Instead, they seem intent on driving 
us toward a full-year continuing reso-
lution. 
If I had been here a long time and 
was a cynical person, which I am not, I 
would be worried that delay was a po-
litical calculation to tie the hands of 
the Biden administration and thwart 
his agenda—governing under a long- 
term continuing resolution is difficult, 
and they know it. But this Vermonter 
tries not to be cynical. 
But I would remind, from a practical 
point of view, the stakes are too high 
to play politics with the practical 
budget. This is not something we 
should play politics with because the 
consequences for the American people 
are too great. The impacts of a full- 
year CR are too onerous for the coun-
try to bear. That is unquestionably 
true for those who claim to care about 
defense programs and national secu-
rity. And you would think that fact all 
by itself would bring all parties to the 
negotiating table. 
A full-year CR would not only reduce 
the defense spending by $37 billion 
compared to the Senate bill I posted, it 
would actually cut defense spending 
below last year’s levels. Since a CR 
freezes programs at last year’s level, 
certain programs would be overfunded 
and others would be underfunded. The 
Department of Defense would be unable 
to shift enough money around within 
their transfer authority to correct the 
imbalances, resulting in billions of 
unspent dollars and even more unmet 
priorities. And you can only imagine 
the waste and confusion that would 
occur. 
With money tied up in outdated pri-
orities, the United States will struggle 
to meet the challenges and threats of 
today. While the U.S. is no longer in 
Afghanistan, a CR would revive the 
Overseas Contingency Operations, OCO, 
to the tune of $69 billion at DOD. And 
that is the account, of course, meant to 
fund wartime activities. It would also 
provide—just think of this for a mo-
ment—$3.3 billion to train and arm the 
now-defunct Afghan security forces. In 
other words, a continuing resolution 
would have $3.3 billion to train and 
arm a no longer existing Afghan secu-
rity force. 
Now, while we are paying for a war 
we are not actually fighting, DOD may 
be forced to reduce the end-strength of 
our military just so they can pay our 
troops and civilian personnel the 2.7- 
percent pay raise they so rightly de-
serve, that is set to go into effect on 
January 1, 2022. In other words, the 
Pentagon may have to lay off soldiers 
to find the money for a pay raise under 
a continuing resolution, while money 
is tied up on a war we are not even 
fighting. That makes no sense. That 
makes no sense. 
Just think of this: We lay off soldiers 
so we can pay for a pay raise, because 
we have our money tied up in a war 
that we are not fighting. I mean, Kafka 
couldn’t think of something this crazy. 
Now, most Members in this Chamber 
would agree that China is one of our 
biggest threats. Reflecting that re-
ality, the President proposed over $66 
billion in military investments to 
counter the growing influence of China. 
None of the new capabilities included 
in the defense appropriations bill would 
be funded under a continuing resolu-
tion. 
So we can say, boy, we are going to 
gear up with China; however, the Sen-
ate can’t get around to vote on it. 
Now, many Senators have come to 
the floor in recent weeks to ask that 
we provide an additional $1 billion for 
Iron Dome. I wonder if they are aware 
that if we have a CR, Iron Dome 
doesn’t get a billion dollars; it gets $73 
million. 
Given these facts—and these are only 
a few of many examples—I am mys-
tified why there doesn’t seem to be any 
urgency on the other side to solve 
these problems. Republican Members 
have been quick to criticize Demo-
cratic leadership for not bringing the 
NDAA to the Senate floor for consider-
ation more quickly, but that is an au-
thorizing bill. And when it comes to ac-
tually funding the Defense—not just 
authorizing, but actually putting the 
money there—they won’t even come to 
the table. Yet, on the very same day, I 
was told that the Republican leader-
ship wants to have a full-year con-
tinuing resolution that would cut de-
fense funding. 
They are out here saying, Why aren’t 
you passing an increase in the Defense 
spending—but, oh, by the way, we want 
a bill that would cut the Defense fund-
ing? 
So I would ask them, which is it? Is 
one aim for the TV soundbites? But if 
rhetoric doesn’t match the reality, 
start being honest with the American 
people. 
If we fail to get a deal on full-year 
appropriations bills, our veterans also 
lose out. Due to increased demands for 
community care, under a continuing 
resolution, the VA will not have suffi-
cient funds to cover medical care for 
veterans. These are men and women 
who served our country. Think of all 
the praise we have had, all the greet-
ings as the great men and women come 
back from wars, many suffering all 
kinds of injuries. ‘‘We will never forget 
our veterans.’’ Oh, yes, we will because 
we won’t stand up and pass the money 
they need. Veterans deserve better 
than this. 
Our domestic priorities will also suf-
fer under a continuing resolution. The 
fiscal year 2022 Senate bills include his-
toric increases to care for and educate 
our Nation’s children, combat climate 
change, build and renovate affordable 
housing, improve our infrastructure, 
and continue to combat the pandemic, 
which is still with us. None of these in-
creases—none 
of 
them—will 
occur 
under a full-year CR. We will be forced 
to operate at last year’s levels in a 
country that now has been transformed 
by a global pandemic. How irrespon-
sible is that? 
For example, in our bill, we provide 
critical funding increases for mental 
health and substance abuse. These 
funds are desperately needed in every 
State in this country as rates of anx-
iety and depression have soared during 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Drug overdose 
deaths are expected to reach their 
highest levels to date. But in a con-
tinuing resolution, we say: Tough. You 
are on your own. We don’t have the 
money. 
Under a continuing resolution, fund-
ing at the National Institutes of Health 
will stagnate, leaving us behind in crit-
ical advancements in medical research 
at a time I think we need it more than 
anytime in my life. 
The fiscal year 2022 Senate bills in-
clude critical investments to combat 
climate change. That would disappear 
under a CR. A CR says we will have 
complacency, not bold action. 
The next few days and weeks are crit-
ical. I hope the American people realize 
what is at stake. I ask our colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to join us 
in negotiating a path forward. 
It is not an exaggeration to say that 
the choice we face with these appro-
priations bills goes to the very heart of 
why we are here. We can either come 
together the way we used to, the way 
democracy is supposed to, and make 
our government work for the American 
people or we can become the branch of 
government where, instead of gov-
erning, the minority party defines its 
role as preventing the Congress from 
doing its job so it can then falsely 
blame the majority party. 
There have been around 2,000 Sen-
ators who have had the privilege of 
serving this country since it began. I 
served with over 400 of them—more 
than 20 percent of all the Senators in 
the Nation’s history. I remember Re-
publicans and Democrats could work 
together, not for their party’s interest 
but for the country’s interest. 
There are only 100 of us. We should be 
the conscience of the Nation. We 
should be working together to protect 
the Nation. But I fear that we have po-
litical gamesmanship, and it is not just 
about these bills but the relevance of 
Congress itself today and for the fu-
ture, whichever party is in the minor-
ity. If that becomes the norm, it is 
going to be impossible to turn the 
clock back. 
We need a top-line deal. Republicans 
need to come to the table and make a 
comprehensive offer. Those of us on 
this side of the aisle are ready to work 
on behalf of the American people. I ask 
our Republican colleagues to join us in 
working for the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise 
to join Chairman LEAHY in calling on 
our Republican colleagues to negotiate 
a final agreement on fiscal year 2022 
appropriations bills. Just as we need to 
complete work on the National Defense 
Authorization Act—a position I have

S7765 
November 4, 2021 
been urging repeatedly on our leader-
ship—we need to complete work on the 
appropriations bills. They are com-
plementary, to say the least, and they 
have to be done. 
Under Chairman LEAHY’s leadership, 
Democrats have put forth a responsible 
top-line number and subcommittee al-
locations that address our defense and 
nondefense funding needs alike. The 
defense funding levels in the appropria-
tions bills are consistent with the bi-
partisan National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act bill that we passed in the 
Armed Services Committee in July. 
I would like to point out that the de-
fense spending level in the Senate 
NDAA bill, which is pending floor ac-
tion, was set by an amendment offered 
by my colleague, the ranking member, 
Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, and supported 
by every Republican on the Armed 
Services Committee. I was pleased to 
work with Senator INHOFE and to co-
sponsor the amendment, which pro-
vides an additional $25 billion in fund-
ing for specific items, most of which 
are unfunded requirements submitted 
by the services and the combatant 
commands. 
But Republicans put all this good 
work and all this good will we built up 
and established in the NDAA process in 
jeopardy if they force us into a year-
long continuing resolution by refusing 
to negotiate on the 12 appropriations 
bills. 
A yearlong CR would be shortsighted 
and damaging to our national defense. 
First, defense spending will be about 
$36 billion lower than the levels set out 
in the Senate’s NDAA and appropria-
tions bills. 
I must also point out that, following 
our lead, the House Armed Services 
Committee passed a bill with the same 
top line—an additional $25 billion. That 
was brought to the floor of the House. 
It passed. In fact, an amendment to re-
duce the funding was defeated. 
So there is a strong bipartisan com-
mitment to vigorously fund the De-
partment of Defense, and if we do not 
do that, if we fall into the trap of a CR, 
as I have indicated, we will be taking 
money away from the Department of 
Defense. 
Second, we will be tied, as Senator 
LEAHY pointed out, to funding prior-
ities from a year ago even though cir-
cumstances have changed remarkably. 
As he pointed out, we have funding in 
last year’s legislation that would pro-
vide support to Afghan forces who have 
been dissipated by the events of Au-
gust. We would have a situation where 
there were significant amounts of 
money intended to assist Afghan secu-
rity concerns that could not be effec-
tively used and would detract from the 
current needs that we have. 
Third, a CR would prevent DOD from 
effectively 
modernizing 
and 
rein-
venting and reinvesting in its pro-
grams. Since new starts—new pro-
grams—aren’t allowed under a CR, 
DOD could be forced into funding leg-
acy systems that are outdated and in-
efficient, and that is simply congres-
sionally mandated waste. Meanwhile, 
important new initiatives and acquisi-
tions could be delayed. For example, 
we may not have the ability to fund 
the three additional ships and the 
seven more Joint Strike Fighters in 
the Navy’s 2022 budget. As we shift our 
focus to the Pacific, as we deal with po-
tential contingencies involving Taiwan 
and other areas, it becomes a shift in 
the Navy. They need these platforms. 
They need them as soon as we can get 
them, and they won’t be able to get 
them if we are stuck with a CR. 
CRs are also terribly disruptive just 
to the normal operation of the Depart-
ment of Defense and also to their part-
ners in the private sector and aca-
demia, since CRs inject uncertainty, 
instability, and cost to the R&D and 
acquisition processes. 
The impact is not just felt on the de-
fense side of the ledger, as Chairman 
LEAHY pointed out. Nondefense prior-
ities have been neglected for over a 
decade. This year, we finally have a 
chance to make up for lost time. 
For example, we have a chance to 
double the Federal commitment to 
public education under the title I pro-
gram and make important investments 
in adult education and job training. 
At a time when the American people 
are clamoring for more mental health 
service, particularly for children, we 
have funding to help train more pedi-
atric mental health specialists. 
We also have funding to help estab-
lish a national suicide prevention life-
line and a three-digit phone number 
that Congress approved last year. We 
are in the midst, sadly, of an epidemic 
of suicides throughout this country, 
and they particularly affect, as we 
pointed out, veterans who have served 
their country with great valor and sac-
rifice and yet are plagued by mental 
health problems. 
As the chairman of the Legislative 
Branch Subcommittee, I will note that 
we have funding to help the Capitol Po-
lice, who have been stretched to their 
limits in the aftermath of the January 
6 assault on this Capitol. In the Senate 
bill, we have funding for new officers, 
overtime and retention payments, as 
well as resources for officer wellness 
and mental health support. After what 
they have done for us, literally saving 
us, we owe it to the men and women of 
the Capitol Police to provide this as-
sistance. It cannot be done under a 
continuing resolution. 
Chairman LEAHY has bent over back-
wards to engage our Republican col-
leagues, and we have to engage. We 
have to move forward. He is willing to 
do that, but we have not seen a com-
parable response from the other side. It 
is time to get down to business, the 
business of the American people. It is 
time to provide our military with the 
resources and the priorities for today, 
not for last year. It is time to recog-
nize the emerging problems in this 
country of this moment, not of the 
past. 
We need our colleagues on the Repub-
lican side to come to the table, not 
with preconditions and redlines but a 
willingness to negotiate on behalf of all 
the American people. Otherwise, we 
will risk a continuing resolution that 
will harm everyone, all the American 
people. 
I yield the floor.

BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
Democrats are closer than we have 
ever been to finalizing and passing leg-
islation to achieve President Biden’s 
Build Back Better agenda. We have 
made great progress since the Presi-
dent announced his framework last 
week, including by coming to an agree-
ment that will, for the first time ever, 
empower Medicare to directly nego-
tiate prices in Part B and Part D and 
lower prices for millions of seniors and 
American families. 
We will also cap out-of-pocket ex-
penses at $2,000 a year, and our agree-
ment will make it so Americans with 
diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per 
month on insulin. One of the great con-
founding mysteries over the last sev-
eral years is, how did insulin—a drug 
that has been on the market for years 
and years and years; there is no pat-
ent—end up costing $600 a dose for peo-
ple who can barely afford it? Diabetes 
affects so many people, and yet they 
have to pay all of this money. 
So, as the House prepares to move 
forward, 
the 
Senate 
continues 
to 
achieve progress in our goal of passing 
Build Back Better before Thanks-
giving. That is our goal. We are moving 
forward because the challenges Amer-
ican families and workers are facing 
are enormous, and President Biden’s 
agenda has many things that will lower 
costs and help families pay the bills— 
lower costs and help families pay the 
bills. 
Take childcare, for instance. Fami-
lies sometimes pay more than $10,000 a 
year for a child just to take care of 
him—a truly backbreaking expense. 
Secretary Yellen warned that the slack

in the labor force is connected to 
childcare. Well, the President’s frame-
work provides the largest investments 
ever to help families afford childcare 
services. 
I believe, of the 37 OECD nations, de-
veloped and semideveloped countries, 
we are the 36th in childcare. Once Build 
Back Better passes, that awful sta-
tistic will be gone. 
Take pre-K. The President’s frame-
work will, for the first time ever, pro-
vide universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year- 
olds. Millions of kids will be able to get 
on the right track early in life because 
of this investment—long overdue. 
We will also extend the child tax 
credit. This will help millions of par-
ents better afford things like groceries 
and diapers and utilities and other 
daily essentials. 
Of course, there are bold steps we are 
taking to fight climate change. Our 
country has had too many homes de-
stroyed by hurricanes and flooding. En-
tire cities in the West are breathing 
toxic air caused by extreme wildfires. 
Heat waves and droughts endanger mil-
lions of Americans who make their liv-
ing working outdoors or who don’t 
have air-conditioning. 
These disasters cost us tens of bil-
lions each year, so Build Back Better’s 
investments will help us reach our cli-
mate goals and represent bold steps in 
the right direction. All the while, the 
President’s plan will be fully paid for 
and help our country reduce infla-
tionary pressures, as no less than 17 
Nobel Prize-winning economists have 
affirmed. 
We are going to keep pushing to get 
these great policies over the finish 
line. As we have said repeatedly, no-
body is getting everything they hoped 
for in the final deal, but Build Back 
Better will have things that everyone 
wanted. 
Passing 
transformative 
legislation 
isn’t easy—it is hard, very hard—but 
the long hours we are putting in and 
the discussions we have had, some of 
them quite pointed, will be worth it 
when we produce a very good result for 
the American people. So we are going 
to keep working and keep working 
until we get this done. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Now, Madam President, on voting, 
yesterday was a sad day because, for 
the fourth time this year, the Senate 
had an opportunity yesterday to begin 
debating on the right to vote, but, yet 
again, virtually every Senate Repub-
lican denied the Senate a chance to act 
as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. They filibustered the mere oppor-
tunity to debate an issue that has had 
a long bipartisan history in the Senate. 
There 
was 
one 
bright 
note—one 
brave, 
courageous exception—and I 
want to thank my colleague, the Sen-
ator from Alaska, Ms. MURKOWSKI, for 
voting in favor of beginning debate on 
the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. I thank my Demo-
cratic colleagues—there are so many— 
particularly Senators LEAHY and DUR-
BIN, for spending weeks working with 
her to find a compromise. 
Senate Democrats want to find a bi-
partisan way forward on the issue of 
voting rights. That is why we worked 
with Senator MURKOWSKI. But, ulti-
mately, it is up to Republicans to come 
to the table and join us. We have been 
trying to convince them for months— 
for months. This has not been a rush. 
We have offered four reasonable pro-
posals in an attempt to merely begin 
debate—in June, in August, in October, 
and now here in November. 
At no point did we call on Repub-
licans to support our policies only but 
just agree to deliberate, to say what 
you think, and maybe we could have 
come to an agreement on something so 
important, as the Senate has always 
done in the past on this issue—bipar-
tisan. 
Off the floor, we held public hearings, 
numerous 
group 
discussions, 
and 
countless one-on-one meetings with the 
other side, including talks led by no 
fewer than seven Democrats—MANCHIN, 
KAINE, TESTER, KING, DURBIN, KLO-
BUCHAR, LEAHY—and there were more, I 
am sure. At virtually every turn, we 
have met with resistance. 
What has happened to the party of 
Lincoln? What has happened to that 
noble, noble view that voting rights are 
important on both sides of the aisle? 
The Senate is capable of far more 
than what we have seen from our Re-
publican colleagues on voting rights. 
Throughout our history, our prede-
cessors used regular order to debate 
and compromise and to pass trans-
formative legislation—Social Security, 
Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights 
Act, and, of course, the Voting Rights 
Act—but anyone who has served in this 
Chamber over recent years knows that 
the gears of the Senate have become 
stiff and slow to turn. 
Who thinks that the original Social 
Security Act would have passed in this 
partisan Chamber today—or any New 
Deal legislation? If we were trying to 
create Medicare from scratch in 2021, 
who thinks that it would have survived 
a filibuster? The same Chamber respon-
sible for those great, noble accomplish-
ments in the past must be restored so 
it can take action in the modern era. 
As I said a few weeks ago, I believe 
the Senate needs to be restored to its 
rightful status as the world’s greatest 
deliberative body. Debate is central to 
this Chamber’s character, but so is 
governing and so is taking action when 
required after debate has run its due 
course. The fight is far from over. 
Democrats 
will 
explore 
alternative 
paths to restore the Senate so it does 
what its Framers intended—debate, de-
liberate, compromise, and vote. 
Just because Republicans will not 
join 
us 
to 
defend 
our 
democracy 
doesn’t mean Democrats will stop 
fighting. It is too important. Even if it 
means going at it alone, we will con-
tinue to fight for voting rights and find 
an alternative path forward to get the 
Senate working again to protect our 
fundamental liberties as citizens. 
NOMINATIONS 
Now, Madam President, on nomina-
tions, today, the Senate is going to 
confirm Mr. Robert Santos to serve as 
the Director of the Census Bureau. 
A native of San Antonio, who grew 
up in a Mexican-American family, Mr. 
Santos, in his 40-year career, has be-
come one of the top statisticians in the 
country. If confirmed, Santos would be 
the first Hispanic and, in fact, the first 
person of color to become a permanent 
Director of the Census Bureau. He is 
exactly the kind of person our country 
needs overseeing our census—impar-
tial, highly experienced, someone from 
outside politics. We must and need to 
protect our census from the pressures 
of partisan politics, and Santos is the 
perfect fit. 
President 
Trump—true 
to 
form— 
spent years trying to politicize and 
weaponize our country’s census, going 
as far as maliciously trying to include 
citizenship questions and have counts 
of 
undocumented 
immigrants. 
Mr. 
Santos will restore trust and integrity 
to one of the most important Agencies 
in government. 
On Mr. Syed—of course, there are too 
many 
other 
qualified 
and 
uncontroversial nominees who are still 
awaiting their confirmations because 
of shameful Republican delay. Mr. 
Dilawar Syed is a particularly egre-
gious example. Syed has been nomi-
nated to serve as second in command 
at the SBA. He is the definition—the 
definition—of 
a 
qualified, 
uncontroversial nominee. His nomina-
tion has been praised by no less than 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce—hardly 
a liberal crowd—and he would be the 
highest ranking Muslim in our govern-
ment. 
But our Republican colleagues on the 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship 
Committee have not just blocked his 
vote, they have even refused to give 
him a markup. Their justification 
keeps changing from one explanation 
to another, which is another way of 
saying there seems to be zero legiti-
mate grounds for opposing him. Today, 
he has been scheduled to have a mark-
up, but because of Republicans, it has 
been pushed back again on account of 
their ridiculous concerns. 
The political right seems to relish in 
trying to score political points by con-
necting far too many of President 
Biden’s nominees—many of whom hap-
pen to be individuals of color—to hot 
button, partisan issues whether or not 
they have any relevance. 
It is shameful, unacceptable, and ri-
diculous for Republicans to keep stall-
ing on Syed’s nomination. He is emi-
nently qualified to serve in the SBA. 
Why are Senate Republicans opposing 
Mr. Syed’s nomination? Let me ask the 
question again. Why are Senate Repub-
licans opposing Mr. Syed’s nomination? 
I urge my colleagues to drop their re-
sistance 
and 
allow 
this 
excellent, 
straightforward nominee to receive 
confirmation. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
CRIME 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week, voters delivered a clear mes-
sage to the Democratic Party: You 
were not elected to radically change 
America. You were not elected to radi-
cally change America—period. 
The message was clear on inflation 
and economics. The message was clear 
on keeping woke propaganda out of 
public schools. The message was clear 
when even the citizens of blue New 
York—blue 
New 
York—voted 
down 
leftwing changes that would weaken 
elections, similar to what has been pro-
posed here multiple times, and the 
message 
was 
clear 
when 
citizens 
pushed back on anti-policing and on 
anti-law enforcement attitudes. 
Even in the most liberal cities in the 
most liberal States, Americans told 
Democrats to leave their extreme cam-
paign to ‘‘defund the police’’ behind. 
Let’s take Minneapolis, for example. 
Last summer, one local Congress-
woman called the police department 
‘‘rotten to the root’’ and insisted that 
‘‘no one is saying that the community 
is not going to be kept safe.’’ 
Well, what happened? 
Homicides are on a pace for the high-
est annual count in decades. So this 
week, Minnesota voters rejected a bal-
lot measure that would have removed 
the police department—listen to this— 
from the city’s charter. 
Or take New York City, where vio-
lent crimes, like robbery and auto 
theft, have seen 10- to 15-percent jumps 
just in the last year. This week, voters 
chose for their mayor a former police 
captain whose platform declared: ‘‘If 
we are for safety, we need the NYPD.’’ 
That is the new mayor of New York. 
Upstate, in Buffalo, a socialist chal-
lenger had won a primary against the 
incumbent mayor, promising in part to 
defund the police. But even though 
prominent New York Democrats en-
dorsed the radical who won the pri-
mary, the incumbent won the race on a 
write-in—on a write-in. 
Our people have just lived through 
the biggest nationwide jump in homi-
cides in more than a century. In my 
hometown of Louisville, murders in 
2021 have already more than doubled 
the annual total from just 2 years ago. 
So, look, Americans do not want less 
public safety. They actually want 
more. No wonder that, over the sum-
mer, one survey found that a majority 
of Americans, including majorities of 
Black and Hispanic respondents, called 
violent crime a ‘‘major crisis,’’ ahead 
of any other issue. 
But it remains to be seen whether 
Democrats here in Washington are get-
ting the message. After all, just a few 
days ago, the Attorney General still 
seemed more focused on intimidating 
America’s parents out of their First 
Amendment rights. 
For the sake of public safety across 
our country, let’s hope that Tuesday’s 
election results compel our friends 
across the aisle to come back—back 
into the mainstream. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, President Biden spent much of the 
past week participating in a U.N. sum-
mit on the so-called Paris climate ac-
cords. 
The event was billed as a serious 
meeting of world leaders committed to 
taking action on climate policy. More 
than 1,000 VIPs arrived in a parade of 
no fewer than 400 private jets—400 pri-
vate jets; a mode of transportation 
that some climate activists say is up to 
14 times more polluting than commer-
cial aviation. 
Hypocrisy was on full display at that 
meeting. 
The topic of discussion was a bad 
deal that, after 6 years, has failed to 
hold any of the major signatories to 
their commitments on reducing emis-
sions. But, of course, that hadn’t 
stopped President Biden from rejoining 
it. The President went as far as apolo-
gizing—apologizing—that the previous 
administration had let the U.S. reduce 
its emissions from outside the deal. He 
pledged that, now, the United States 
‘‘will do our part.’’ 
Now, exactly what that means is not 
clear. The United States exceeded in 
cutting its emissions more from out-
side the Paris deal than any other 
major country managed from inside 
the deal. 
So President Biden apologized for 
outperforming the deal, and his coun-
terparts welcomed America’s new com-
mitment to reduce U.S. emissions 50 
percent by 2030, without a single spe-
cific on how to achieve it. 
Now, while America’s emissions have 
fallen, the world’s leading carbon emit-
ter apparently has a free pass to keep 
on increasing its emissions until 2030. 
According to China’s own representa-
tives, their massive and thriving econ-
omy is still in a ‘‘special development 
stage.’’ ‘‘Special development stage.’’ 
We are talking about a country that 
built more than three times as much 
new coal power capacity as the rest of 
the world combined in 2020. 
Meanwhile, one outside analysis indi-
cates that getting America even close 
to net zero emissions by 2050 would 
mean cutting our own GDP by nearly 
12 percent annually. That is trillions of 
dollars shipped out of this country 
every year. Competitors, like China, 
are licking their chops. 
And what would this self-flagellation 
get us 39 years from now? 
According to that same outside anal-
ysis, based on the U.N.’s own model, 
this economic hemorrhage would pur-
chase us a reduction of three-tenths— 
three-tenths—of 1 degree in global tem-
peratures. 
Meanwhile, the same Washington 
Democrats who think that this night-
mare sounds like a good deal are push-
ing 
a 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree that would hammer American 
families and the affordable energy they 
need to power and to heat their homes 
and to drive their cars. 
After less than a year with Demo-
crats in power, America has already 
more than doubled imports of Russian 
oil from December 2020 levels—double 
the dependency on Russia in less than 
12 months—America’s energy future, as 
imagined by our colleagues on the left. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded and that 
I be allowed to speak for up to 15 min-
utes and that Senator CARPER be al-
lowed to speak for up to 2 minutes at 
the conclusion of my remarks prior to 
the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, just 
in the last day or so, the ever-evolving 
reckless tax-and-spending spree bill 
proposed by the Democrats—it con-
tinues to change because they can’t 
seem to figure out how to put together 
something that might pass in the 
House and the Senate, and finding it 
increasingly difficult, I think, to try 
and contain the cost of all the things 
they want to do, which is why they 
continue to build in gimmicks and 
phony math to try to accommodate all 
the crazy spending in this bill, and 
then also the massive run-up in the 
taxes. 
This bill is the largest spending in-
crease we have seen in history, largest 
tax increase in history, and we are 
finding out now it is also going to add 
significantly to the Federal debt be-
cause there is a recent study by Penn 
Wharton which suggests that the over-
all cost of the bill, when fully imple-
mented, would be $3.9 trillion and that 
the revenues that are proposed to be 
raised to pay for it only generate about 
$1.5 trillion. So that leaves you with a 
$2.4 
trillion 
delta 
that, 
obviously, 
would be added to the deficit and put 
on the debt. 
So not only does this spend enormous 
amounts 
of 
money, 
unprecedented 
amounts of money, it raises an unprec-
edented amount of revenue. But even 
at that level, the revenue is totally in-
adequate and insufficient to cover that 
spending; therefore, it will add mas-
sively to the Federal debt—that is ac-
cording to an economic analysis done 
by Penn Wharton here just in the last 
couple days. 
But this is the most recent addition 
to that bill in the House of Representa-
tives. They would raise the SALT cap—

the state and local tax deduction cap— 
from $10,000 to $72,500. And it would 
also extend that higher cap through 
2031, beyond its scheduled expiration 
after 2025. 
So they are still trying to come up 
with a way—if you can believe this. 
The massive amount of spending, mas-
sive amount of taxing, is now added to 
that a tax cut—a huge tax cut for rich 
people. 
According to the Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget, if you look 
at how this distributes proportionately 
across income ranges, those making 
less than $100,000 would receive 2.5 per-
cent of that tax cut—a tax cut that 
would cost $300 billion just through 
2025. So if it is fully implemented for 
the full 10-year window, you are talk-
ing about hundreds of billions of dol-
lars more in tax cuts to rich people. 
So just think about that. From the 
side that always says that our side is 
looking out for rich people, trying to 
cut taxes for the rich, they are pro-
posing and have included now in the 
House version of the reckless tax-and- 
spending spree bill a provision that 
would provide tax cuts to rich people. 
In fact, 80 percent of that tax cut—80 
percent—would go to people who are 
making more than $200,000 a year; 2.5 
percent would go to people making less 
than $100,000 a year. 
So much for looking out for the little 
guy in this bill. 
This is a huge part of the bill. In fact, 
this is the most expensive provision in 
the bill, and that is up against all the 
other spending that the Democrats 
want to do on new government pro-
grams and expanding government—the 
biggest expansion in government in 
decades. 
But included now in the bill not only 
is that massive expansion spending on 
lots of crazy new ideas and trillions of 
dollars in new taxes that will be im-
posed upon the economy, but now there 
is a provision in there that will cut 
taxes with 80 percent of that benefit 
going to people making more than 
$200,000 a year, and cutting taxes on a 
scale that makes this the largest, most 
expensive provision in the entire reck-
less tax-and-spending spree bill. That is 
what we are talking about with this 
particular provision. 
So I just want to point that out be-
cause this is an evolving bill. We are 
seeing new language every day, new 
ideas every day. And, again, some real-
ly horrible ideas have come out in the 
last few weeks, some of which have 
gone away simply because there aren’t 
even any Democrats who will vote for 
them; but this one, obviously, that is 
going to benefit rich people across this 
country on a level unlike anything else 
in the bill, as is suggested by the over-
all cost of the provision and the way it 
distributes among income categories. 
Let me repeat: 80 percent of the ben-
efit of this tax cut in the tax-and- 
spending spree is going to go to people 
making more than $200,000 a year, and 
2.5 percent of this tax cut will go to 
people making less than $100,000 a year. 
CHILDCARE BENEFIT 
Mr. President, I think a lot of times 
when people think about the govern-
ment paying for healthcare, childcare, 
college, or the like, they tend just to 
assume that they are going to be able 
to continue on with or get their pre-
ferred healthcare or childcare and the 
only difference would be the fact that 
the government is now picking up the 
tab. 
If you listen to the Democrats talk 
about it, that is certainly what you 
would think. But the reality is a lot 
different, because with government 
money 
comes 
government 
control. 
Government money rarely comes with-
out strings attached, and no more is 
that more obvious than with the 
childcare provisions of the so-called 
Build Back Better tax-and-spending 
spree Democrats are contemplating. 
To hear Democrats talk about it, you 
might think that the childcare provi-
sions amounted to nothing more than 
government cutting you a check to 
help with your daycare costs. The re-
ality is a lot different. 
Mr. President, a 2020 Bipartisan Pol-
icy Center survey found that 53 percent 
of working families who used center- 
based childcare used a faith-based 
childcare center—53 percent. Parents 
select faith-based childcare for a vari-
ety of reasons. Some choose it because 
they share the faith of the provider, 
but many choose it for other reasons, 
as the Bipartisan Policy Center study 
made clear. 
Some opt for the faith-based center 
because they like the quality of the fa-
cilities and the quality of the instruc-
tion; others because they feel that the 
faith-based facility will provide a safe 
setting, and though they just don’t 
share the belief system of the pro-
viders, they do like the values that the 
belief system represents. 
Well, for many of those families, 
their days of choosing faith-based 
childcare may be numbered because 
Democrats’ new childcare provisions 
are deliberately set up to put faith- 
based childcare providers at a dis-
advantage. 
For starters, the language of the leg-
islation would likely exclude many 
faith-based childcare providers from 
participating in the program. That 
means that even if you as a parent pre-
fer to choose your local faith-based 
childcare center, you may not be able 
to do so. 
On top of that, the bill provides fund-
ing to assist with renovation or remod-
eling at daycare facilities, but it spe-
cifically prevents these funds from 
going to childcare centers that share 
space with facilities for worship or reli-
gious instruction. 
That means that the childcare pro-
gram at your local Catholic church or 
local Lutheran church or your local 
mosque will most likely not be allowed 
to take advantage of the government 
assistance for renovations, although 
the secular provider down the street 
will. 
These policies are likely to have pro-
found consequences. Obviously, many 
parents are likely to find themselves 
prevented from choosing their pre-
ferred faith-based childcare provider. 
But beyond that, this legislation can 
start crowding faith-based childcare 
providers out of the childcare market 
entirely. Childcare providers unable to 
participate 
in 
the 
government 
childcare program may find themselves 
struggling to stay in business or being 
forced to raise their fees to the point 
that only the most well-off families 
can afford faith-based care. 
The result: a shrinking number of 
faith-based providers, which, I am 
afraid, is probably some Democrats’ 
goal. 
It is hard to imagine why else they 
would 
restrict 
parents’ 
ability 
to 
choose a faith-based provider for their 
children or exclude religious childcare 
providers from receiving government 
renovation assistance. 
The Democrats’ legislation is rep-
resentative of a growing tendency in 
the Democratic Party to treat reli-
gious people as second-class citizens— 
something that is completely out of 
step with the robust idea of religious 
freedom we traditionally have in this 
country. 
The First Amendment is not in-
tended to keep religion out of the pub-
lic square, as many Democrats seem to 
think, nor was it intended to favor sec-
ular belief systems over religious ones, 
no. Its purpose was to prevent the gov-
ernment from establishing a national 
religion or infringing on the rights of 
religious individuals to live out their 
faith. 
Today, however, it has become appar-
ent that many Democrats think at 
least some forms of government dis-
crimination against religious people 
are perfectly acceptable, and there is 
no question that their childcare pro-
gram would place faith-based childcare 
providers at a disadvantage. 
Steering parents away from faith- 
based childcare is not the only choice 
Democrats are going to be making for 
parents under this new childcare ben-
efit. Democrats’ childcare program will 
not only make it more difficult for par-
ents to choose faith-based care, it will 
make it more difficult for parents to 
choose any private childcare provider. 
Under the Democrats’ legislation, 
only public—in other words, govern-
ment-run—childcare providers will be 
guaranteed sufficient reimbursement 
to cover their operating costs. This is a 
deliberate choice that will make it 
much more difficult for private pro-
viders to stay in business, serving the 
Democrats’ goal of pushing children 
into government-run childcare pro-
grams. 
That is not the end of the childcare 
decisions Democrats will be making. 
The Democrats’ legislation also gives 
the Federal Government full control 
over approving childcare curricula and 
performance standards. Providers will 
be measured not by how well parents

are satisfied with the childcare they 
are providing, but by whatever Wash-
ington bureaucrats determine to be ap-
propriate measures of performance. 
I am not sure why Washington bu-
reaucrats are better suited than par-
ents to identify quality childcare pro-
viders, but as the Democrat candidate 
for the Governor of Virginia recently 
made clear, Democrats do not seem to 
think that parents are best suited to 
make decisions for their children. 
Mr. President, I can go on. I can talk 
about the confusing government bu-
reaucracy parents will have to navi-
gate 
under 
the 
Democrats’ 
new 
childcare program, or I can talk about 
the fact that this new childcare benefit 
could drive up childcare costs for mid-
dle-class families over the next 3 years 
by a staggering $13,000 a year, accord-
ing to one estimate. Yeah, $13,000 a 
year. 
But, today, what I really want to em-
phasize is something Democrats con-
veniently omit from discussions of 
their new government programs, and 
that is, as I said, that with government 
money 
comes 
government 
control. 
Democrats are setting the stage for a 
government 
takeover 
of 
childcare, 
where you can choose your provider 
only as long as Democrats agree with 
your choice. 
ABORTION 
Mr. President, before I close, I want 
to mention one other aspect of the 
Democratic bill, and that is the bill’s 
commitment to taxpayer funding of 
abortion. 
While the Democratic Party has long 
supported an abortion agenda, there 
has at least been bipartisan agreement 
when it comes to appropriations bills 
that we are not going to use taxpayer 
dollars to fund abortion. 
For decades—decades, going back to 
the 1980s—the Hyde amendment and 
other riders have helped prevent tax-
payer dollars from paying for abor-
tions. No longer, if Democrats have 
their way. 
In the Democrats’ tax-and-spending 
spree, taxpayer funding of abortions is 
the order of the day. Restrictions on 
the use of taxpayer dollars for abortion 
funding are omitted, and in at least 
one case, Democrats actively require 
funding of abortion and would override 
State laws on insurance coverage of 
abortion. 
Let’s be very clear. This bill is a slap 
in the face to every American who be-
lieves in the sanctity of human life and 
doesn’t want his or her tax dollars 
going to pay for killing unborn human 
beings. 
You would think that if we can’t 
agree that the human rights of unborn 
children should be protected, we could 
at least agree that taxpayers shouldn’t 
be forced to pay for killing unborn chil-
dren. 
Well, apparently, even that is too 
much to ask for Democrats, even 
though nearly 60 percent of Americans 
oppose having their tax dollars go to 
abortion. That’s right, almost 60 per-
cent of Americans do not want their 
tax dollars going to pay for abortions. 
But that doesn’t seem to matter to 
the Democratic Party, which is square-
ly in the pocket of the radical abortion 
lobby. The Democrats’ legislation con-
tains a radical commitment to govern-
ment funding of abortions against the 
wishes of the majority of the American 
people. 
It is just one more reason why the 
Build Back Better plan is a bad deal for 
the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, how 
much time do I have? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has 2 minutes. 
Mr. CARPER. Thanks very much. 
Mr. President, I don’t have enough 
time to respond to everything that my 
colleague from South Dakota has said. 
If I did, it would take a long while. 
I would say this: A couple of years 
ago, when we passed with only Repub-
lican votes in the House and Senate, 
signed by President Trump, a tax-cut 
bill that was supposed to pay for itself, 
it didn’t. It increased our deficit by 
hundreds of billions of dollars. 
I think most of us know, with respect 
to abortion, the law of the land for 
many years—over 30 years—has been 
Roe v. Wade; and, essentially, after a 
certain point, when you have viability 
in the womb, abortions cannot be per-
formed except in very limited cases, in-
cluding rape, incest, and the life of the 
mother. 
The legislation that we passed and 
considered in the House does not pro-
vide for changing those limitations, 
and that needs to be made clear. 
The other thing I would say, with re-
spect to the reconciliation bill, the 
Build Back Better legislation that the 
House is considering today in the Rules 
Committee, it is paid for. It is actually 
paid for, and it is paid for largely by 
making sure that everybody is paying 
their fair share. 
Folks don’t mind in my State—and 
other States don’t mind—you know, 
seeing their taxes raised, but they 
want to make sure that everybody else 
is paying their fair share. As it turns 
out, there are a lot of wealthy people 
in this country and a lot of wealthy 
corporations who don’t pay their fair 
share—in some cases nothing—and that 
is just wrong. 
And the legislation actually cuts 
taxes for most Americans. 
VOTE ON CONNOR NOMINATION 
Mr. President, now to the issue at 
hand. We are about to vote today on 
the nomination of Michael Connor to 
serve as Assistant Secretary of the 
Army for Civil Works. 
As we all know, this is a critical 
leadership position for the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers. The Corps of Engi-
neers Civil Works program is the na-
tion’s primary provider of water re-
sources infrastructure, and with the in-
creasing impacts of climate change, 
having someone of Mr. Connor’s caliber 
at the Corps is critical. 
He has the experience and character 
to be successful in this role. During the 
Obama administration, he served as 
Deputy Secretary of the Interior, and 
he proved himself to be a capable lead-
er. He will bring that experience to the 
Corps. 
If confirmed, Mr. Connor will lead ef-
forts that dramatically impact every 
corner of this country, from coastal to 
inland to small, disadvantaged, rural, 
and Tribal communities. 
It is critically important that we get 
Mr. Connor confirmed now, today. I 
urge my colleagues to support his nom-
ination. 
I think my time has expired. 
I yield the floor.

BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, over the 
last year, America’s economy has fal-
tered and the American people are 
struggling. Families have been con-
fronted with rising inflation, which is 
essentially a tax on their paycheck 
every time they go to the grocery 
store, every time they fill up the gas 
tank, and every time they go out and 
buy clothing or essentials for their 
family. America’s small businesses, 
after suffering from the COVID shut-
downs last year, are facing supply 
chain issues and labor shortages. 
It is no surprise that the majority of 
Americans believe our economy is in 
poor health and they fear things are 
getting worse. 
And the Democrats’ answer to the 
growing economic anxiety? 
Double down on Big Government 
policies. 
President 
Biden 
and 
Democratic 
leaders are pursuing a $2 trillion tax- 
and-spending spree that offers Ameri-
cans more debt, more government, 
more taxes, and more inflation. They 
think that government is the answer to 
all our problems. This $2 trillion bill is 
an attempt to fundamentally trans-
form from an opportunity-driven soci-
ety built on the American dream to a 
dependency-driven society powered by 
the Federal Government. 
The Biden administration put a lot of 
work into trying to market their 
plan—their 
tax-and-spending 
spree. 
They claim it will bring down costs and 
help the middle class. 
But what are their top priorities? 
Tax cuts for their wealthy donors in 
New York and California and other 
blue States that have State and local 
taxes, giving them a deduction on 
those taxes imposed by State legisla-
tures and Democratic Governors. They 
want to raise the SALT tax from 
$10,000 to $72,000, a move that mainly 
benefits wealthy Americans. 
Ninety-seven percent of the tax cuts 
would go to Americans making more 
than $100,000 a year. Millionaires would 
get a $23,000 tax cut. And, as Demo-
crats’ rich donors get richer, middle- 
class families get poorer. 
Although 
Democrats 
are 
touting 
their childcare cost entitlement pro-
gram, the devil really is in the details. 
While a single parent stands to receive 
thousands of dollars in childcare pay-
ments, married parents at the same in-
come level would receive no assistance 
at all. 
Once the regulations in the bill are 
factored in, the cost of unsubsidized 
childcare will skyrocket. Millions of 
middle-class families won’t get sub-
sidies because they make more than 
$67,000 a year, and they will be on the 
hook for the rising costs of healthcare 
that their proposal will create. Accord-
ing to one analysis, parents making 
more than $67,000 a year can see their 
childcare costs skyrocket by more than 
$13,000 in the first year of the program. 
How many middle-class families can 
afford that? 
Democrats also want to meddle with 
our Nation’s economy under the guise 
of promising that they just want to 
combat climate change. 
The Democrats are proposing a new 
electric vehicle tax credit, which would 
subsidize high-cost electric vehicles for 
affluent Americans who can already af-
ford them. To make matters worse, 
Democrats are offering a second tax 
credit only if you purchase an electric 
vehicle constructed by their Big Labor 
union allies. That’s right, a car built in 
a non-union shop doesn’t get the tax 
subsidy; a car built in a union shop 
does. 
Look, I support clean energy, and I 
have got a record of supporting it here 
in the Senate and back in my time at 
the House of Representatives in North 
Carolina, but I don’t support having 
the Federal Government unfairly pick 
winners and losers in the private mar-
kets. 
Democrats also hope to create a Ci-
vilian Climate Corps to give young lib-
eral activists paid jobs—jobs paid by 
the American taxpayer. That is an out-
rageous concept, considering that we 
already have a record number of jobs 
that private employers can’t fill. The 
government is going to create jobs to 
compete with these businesses that are 
desperately looking for labor. 
But this isn’t about jobs. It is about 
the socialist wing of the Democratic 
Party having their own army of gov-
ernment-funded social justice warriors. 
It is no surprise that the Civilian Cli-
mate Corps is championed by the rad-
ical and anti-Semitic Sunrise Move-
ment. Their activists have protested 
climate policy in the past by blocking 
traffic during rush hour and chaining 
themselves to boats. They also fre-
quently go to homes of elected offi-
cials—including me, just back in Au-
gust—to trespass on property and to

harass and intimidate us into sup-
porting their extreme socialist de-
mands. These activists would be at the 
top of the list to get taxpayer-funded 
jobs in the Civilian Climate Corps. And 
by their own admission, progressives 
see it expanding well beyond the scope 
of climate change to anything the left 
considers social justice. 
These are just some of the provisions 
in the Democrats’ Big Government 
spending spree. 
The next logical question is, how do 
they intend to pay for it? 
They will do it by raising taxes, 
shaking down the middle class, and 
adding more to our debt. 
They have proposed doubling the size 
of the IRS. The IRS already has 83- to 
85,000 people. They are proposing hiring 
another 80,000 people, doubling the size 
of the IRS. Democrats want to expand 
the size of the IRS in order to monitor 
bank accounts of hard-working Ameri-
cans in the hopes of squeezing more 
money out of them. 
While millionaires and billionaires 
have tax lawyers and accountants to 
handle an IRS inquiry, hard-working, 
middle-class 
Americans 
don’t. 
And 
there is nothing more chilling than 
getting a call from the IRS or a letter 
saying that you are about to be audited 
or ‘‘We just have a few questions for 
you.’’ They are going to have to take 
on the IRS themselves when they get 
accused of not paying enough. 
My friend, the Senator from West 
Virginia, has spoken out against the 
plan to double the size and scope of the 
IRS, and I agree with him. He has also 
warned Democrats on the dangers of 
creating massive new spending pro-
grams at the same time that Social Se-
curity and Medicare are on the verge of 
bankruptcy. 
Focus group-approved slogans and 
new promises the government can’t 
keep might be good politics for Demo-
crats, but it is horrible policy for 
Americans. 
Americans 
can’t 
afford 
more 
inflation, 
more 
taxes, 
more 
childcare costs, and more government. 
The Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree 
won’t Build Back Better; it will only 
make life harder for Americans already 
struggling to get by. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my 
friend from North Carolina expressed 
his point of view. I would like to ex-
press mine. 
Do you think that those who are 
making incomes in America in the 
highest levels should pay their fair 
share of taxes? 
I do. 
Do you think that those who get the 
tax break from the Trump tax plan of 
4 years ago, which added $2 trillion to 
our deficit, should pay more in taxes? 
I do. 
Do you think we should help families 
who are struggling with the cost of liv-
ing to defray those costs, for example, 
for daycare? 
Well, I do; and I can tell you from my 
family experience, so do my kids. 
What do you think about the possi-
bility of starting kids in school, a pos-
sibility at 3 years of age or 4 years of 
age, if that is a parent’s choice? Is that 
a good idea? 
I think it is. And so do educators. 
If kids get a flying start at edu-
cation, they have a much more likely 
chance to succeed and to graduate and 
to progress to a point in life where 
they are making a living and more. 
That is part of it. 
So do you support, as I do, cutting 
the rate of childhood poverty in the 
United States in half? 
I think we ought to at least do that, 
maybe even more. 
If your answer was yes to these ques-
tions, what I describe is the mechanism 
which we have taken into the reconcili-
ation process. It is a long Senate word 
for a bill that we are going to consider 
in about 10 days to 2 weeks. What we 
are trying to do is to alleviate and re-
duce the costs that families face. 
It is a legitimate question raised by 
the Senator from North Carolina: Well, 
who is going to pay for this? 
It is paid for by people in the highest 
income categories. If you are making 
less than $400,000 a year, your taxes 
will not go up. That is what Biden said 
in the campaign, and that is the stand-
ard we have been governed by. For 
those who are not paying their fair 
share of taxes, they may have to. 
And I am not nervous about putting 
more auditors in the IRS to look at 
how much taxes people pay because I 
know what the numbers are. Working 
families, particularly those who have 
withholding, are paying their fair share 
within a few percentage points; but at 
the highest income level, these folks 
are finding ways to avoid their taxes. 
So working families are paying their 
fair share and the wealthiest Ameri-
cans—some of them—are not. So these 
new IRS auditors will make sure every-
body pays their fair share. 
How is that for a starting point? 
You shouldn’t be afraid of hiring 
more cops on the beat if you are not 
violating the law, and that, I think, is 
a reality that most of us realize in life. 
In terms of other payments, corpora-
tions that have profited, declaring mil-
lions of dollars in booked gains and 
profits, don’t you think they ought to 
pay something? 
I sure do. There ought to be a min-
imum tax that these corporations pay 
if they are profitable beyond certain 
million-dollar ranges. That is reason-
able to me. Average Americans are 
paying their fair share. Small busi-
nesses are paying their fair share, but 
some of these folks have found ways to 
avoid these taxes. I think we ought to 
look into that. 
What is the goal here? 
The goal here isn’t socialism, how-
ever the Senator wishes to define it. 
The goal is to have the government 
give families—working families in par-
ticular—a helping hand by reducing the 
cost of daycare, by making more edu-
cation 
available, 
by 
providing 
a 
childcare tax credit to some of these 
families, by providing home health 
services for their parents and grand-
parents who need a helping hand. 
Now there is a very popular idea, be-
cause a lot of folks who are raising 
small children also have to worry 
about grandma and grandpa and how 
they are doing. Are they in place where 
they feel safe and secure and taken 
care of? Or if they can stay home, that 
is even better. That is what this bill 
does. 
The reconciliation bill provides addi-
tional assistance for those people who 
want to live in the independence of 
their home to have home healthcare 
services. I can’t think of a better in-
come than if that is part of what they 
do, and it involves government getting 
into the picture. For some of my col-
leagues, that is reprehensible—that is 
just pure socialism. 
But I might remind those who are 
following my remarks, when Social Se-
curity was created to give fiscal sol-
vency to families once retired, it was 
branded as communism or socialism. 
Then came the idea of Medicare, health 
insurance for seniors in America in the 
1960s. 
Do you know what the American 
Medical Association called it? 
Socialized medicine or 
socialism. 
Every time the government steps in to 
solve a problem which the economy 
can’t solve by itself, the critics will al-
ways say it is socialism; it is too much 
government. 
Well, we have got to take care that 
the amount of government we give to 
this country is adequate to meet the 
needs of these families who are strug-
gling with the cost of living today. I 
believe these are steps in the right dic-
tion. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. DURBIN. How does going zero to 
60 in 3 seconds sound to you? How 
about traversing through terrains of 
unimaginable challenge? Or having an 
entire kitchen stowed away in your car 
wherever you go? 
These are just a few of the innova-
tions being pioneered by the minds of 
Rivian, the company that is leading 
the electric vehicle revolution in my 
home State of Illinois. 
The company recently released the 
R1T, which ‘‘Motor Trend’’ has de-
scribed as ‘‘the most remarkable pick-
up we’ve ever driven.’’ 
That truck won’t be built in China 
and it won’t be built in Europe. It will 
be built in the heart of Illinois, in a 
town aptly named Normal. 
The story of Normal is a story of re-
vival and opportunity. Six years ago, a 
local Mitsubishi plant shut down, leav-
ing thousands of workers unemployed. 
Today, that once shuttered factory has 
sprung back to life, manufacturing the 
first mass-produced electric truck in 
America. And even better, lawmakers 
in Illinois are now positioning Normal 
to continue leading the industry. 
Earlier this year, the State of Illinois 
provided more than $7 million to a

community college in Normal, IL, to 
launch a program training electric ve-
hicle technicians. Graduates of that 
program will be fully prepared to land 
good-paying jobs at Rivian or one of 
the other countries that are suppliers 
in the electric vehicle industry. 
Why is this good news not just for Il-
linois? 
Each additional Rivian truck on the 
road will help confront the threat of 
climate change. 
Transportation accounts for more 
than a fourth—let me repeat that— 
more than a fourth of total greenhouse 
gas emissions. If every vehicle on the 
road were electric, we would probably 
be on our way to a green future. What 
is happening in Normal proves that in-
vesting 
in 
sustainable 
innovation 
drives sustainable economic growth for 
everyone, and it is a look into the fu-
ture that Democrats envision under 
the Build Back Better agenda, a future 
in which every American can gain the 
skills they need to be competitive in 
the 
21st 
century 
and 
American 
innovators have the incentives they 
need to pioneer new technology. 
CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE 
Madam 
President, 
the 
story 
of 
Normal’s revival will be in the front of 
my mind tomorrow as I depart for the 
United Nations’ 26th Conference of Par-
ties climate summit in Glasgow. This 
gathering is an opportunity for the 
United States and our allies to come 
together for the first time in years 
around a shared goal: taking bold steps 
to address the climate crisis. 
One of those steps is the Build Back 
Better World Partnership, an initiative 
that will bring together the world’s 
major democracies to support sustain-
able development in low- and middle- 
income countries. This partnership will 
help counter China’s rising influence in 
the world by equipping developing na-
tions with the resources they need to 
grow their economies without relying 
on fossil fuels. 
On the note of China, Xi Jinping’s ab-
sence from the COP conference in Scot-
land should be an alarm bell for the 
international community. China is the 
world’s biggest producer of greenhouse 
gas emissions. They emit more than 
every other developed nation com-
bined. And the country is headed in the 
wrong direction. Over the next decade, 
the Chinese Communist Party plans to 
build 
dozens 
of 
new 
coal 
plants 
throughout the country. 
China’s leaders insist they are com-
mitted to addressing climate change, 
but the commitments they have made 
are inadequate. Carbon neutrality by 
2060 is too little, too late. 
Fortunately, over the past 2 weeks, 
President Biden has shown the world 
that if you want a partner in saving 
the planet, follow America’s lead; work 
together, across borders. Already, the 
strategy is working. Yesterday, a coali-
tion of more than 40 countries, includ-
ing the United Kingdom, Poland, and 
Vietnam, announced they will phase 
out coal power over the next two dec-
ades. 
There is no doubt that the inter-
national commitments we agreed to in 
Glasgow are crucial to combating cli-
mate change, but the question I hope 
to ask our foreign allies is, What will 
you do the moment you return home? 
Climate 
change 
isn’t 
a 
faraway 
threat. The extreme weather events 
over the past year have shown it is al-
ready here. Over the summer, one 
storm alone, Hurricane Ida, caused $100 
billion in damages—one storm, $100 bil-
lion—twice as much as Democrats have 
proposed to spend each year to reduce 
the harm of climate change. And these 
costs are only getting worse. 
Last 
month, 
our 
Nation’s 
intel-
ligence community released a land-
mark national intelligence estimate on 
climate change. The report illustrated 
how a changing climate is one of the 
biggest threats to national security 
and economic stability. It warns that 
over the next two decades, climate 
change will increase global poverty and 
instability and could lead to conflicts 
and wars and dwindling supplies of 
food, water, and habitable land. Hun-
dreds of millions of people are likely to 
be displaced by 2050. 
Among the 11 nations at greatest 
risk of collapse from climate stress, by 
this estimate, 5 are in our own hemi-
sphere, and 2 possess nuclear weapons 
in other places in the world. 
These humanitarian crises could also 
give rise to anti-democratic populists. 
We have seen it in Hungary. We have 
seen these same politicians rising in 
France and Germany, peddling fear and 
xenophobia after an influx of refugees. 
The NIE warns us that ‘‘current poli-
cies and pledges are insufficient’’ to 
meet the goals of the Paris climate 
conference. That is why the question 
for anyone in a position of power is: 
What are you doing about climate 
change today? 
Well, between the bipartisan infra-
structure bill and the Build Back Bet-
ter package, Democrats are proposing 
roughly $900 billion toward the climate 
change threat. This would be the larg-
est investment in climate action in 
history. 
These proposals will accelerate our 
Nation’s transition to a clean energy 
future, upgrade our power grid and the 
rest of our physical infrastructure, and 
establish America as a global leader. 
This could pave the way for every 
State to attract job creators like 
Rivian or Lion Electric in Joliet, IL, 
which announced an electric vehicle 
plant earlier this year. 
I heard the previous speaker criticize 
the idea of a Climate Corps. It is mod-
eled, really, after the Conservation 
Corps of the New Deal that goes back 
at least 80 years. I can’t understand 
why we would criticize an effort to put 
young people to work so that they 
would have jobs that would improve 
the world we live in, the Nation we live 
in, and make a decent income in the 
process. For many of the kids, this will 
be their first chance to really under-
stand what life should be like. Why 
wouldn’t we want that? I don’t know 
about North Carolina, but in Illinois, 
we can certainly use their good, hard 
work. 
I got a call yesterday from the presi-
dent of the Cook County board, Toni 
Preckwinkle, who said we have forest 
preserves all over Cook County—and 
they are a beauty to behold—but they 
need basic work. If the Climate Corps 
members can do it, we want to hire 
them locally and engage them in that 
process and give them a good life expe-
rience. 
What could be wrong with that? That 
these kids, who might otherwise not 
have a chance at a job, get a decent job 
and get rewarded for their good work, 
with a paycheck when it is all over. 
For many of us, that was a formative 
experience we are never going to for-
get. There are a lot of kids who deserve 
it, and there is a lot to be done by this 
effort. 
I want to say at this point, as I 
close—I see other Members on the 
floor—that we cannot wait when it 
comes to climate change. There are 
people who want us to be at the back of 
the pack, for America to come in sec-
ond, when we are talking about chang-
ing the climate for the better in this 
Nation and around the world. I think 
American leadership is needed. It has 
always been an inspiration to many 
other countries and can be again today. 
I thank the President for his leader-
ship. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Wyo-
ming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
Biden administration’s agenda, which 
is anti-American energy. That is what 
we are facing in the country today. 
President Biden just got back from a 
trip to Europe. He went there to attend 
the United Nations’ Climate Change 
Conference. I noted the previous speak-
er said he was jetting off to there this 
weekend, heading to Scotland. 
He also made reference to the Cli-
mate Corps, which is part of President 
Biden’s agenda. He said: Who could 
criticize it? Well, I am happy to criti-
cize it. That legislation is asking to 
hire 1 million Americans—1 million 
Americans—to protest, to wage war on 
oil, gas, and coal jobs, energy jobs in 
this country. This is at a time when we 
have 10 million open jobs in this coun-
try and ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs all 
around my State and the States of all 
the Members on the floor today. Yet 
the Biden administration’s answer to 
rising energy costs is to hire a million 
people to protest American energy and 
American jobs as the prices continue to 
go up and inflation continues to ravage 
the paychecks of the American people. 
So, yes, they are flying off to Scot-
land, so many of the Members on that 
side of the aisle. The Democrats have 
joined John Kerry. NANCY PELOSI is 
heading there. Many in this body from 
the Democratic side of the aisle will be

joining them, heading there soon. Well, 
back at home, people are struggling 
with inflation that is at a 30-year high 
as a result of the policies of this ad-
ministration. 
One in five American families has cut 
their spending this year. Why? To pay 
for the energy bills that are being 
brought forth by the policies of this ad-
ministration, which is anti-American 
energy. 
The cost of a gallon of gasoline has 
gone up a dollar a gallon since Presi-
dent Biden has come into office. It 
means the cost of everything else is up 
as well because higher prices aren’t 
just prices you pay at the pump; they 
are prices you pay at the grocery store. 
At the same time, the cost of natural 
gas has doubled, and it is now at a 
point where it is at the highest price it 
has been in 7 years. Half of the homes 
in this country are heated with natural 
gas. Winter is coming, and it is going 
to get worse. 
This leaves less money in people’s 
paychecks. They pay so much to fill 
up, so much to heat their home, there 
is less money for their family. That is 
why the New York Times’ front page 
story last week talked about Thanks-
giving and the cost of walloping the 
wallet of American families. People are 
soon going to have to decide whether 
they will have the money to heat or to 
eat. 
That is what we are facing as a result 
of the agenda of this administration. 
So what is the President doing about 
it? Well, he went to Europe, and, aston-
ishingly, he apologized to the world for 
America. He made unrealistic pledges 
to cut emissions. He said he was going 
to cut 1 billion tons in the next 8 years 
and went so far as to say the United 
States would reach zero emissions in 28 
years. That would be a most dramatic 
change in the history of the American 
economy. It is a reckless promise. Yet 
the President did get the applause from 
the global elite. Well, the American 
people aren’t applauding. The Amer-
ican people are wringing their hands 
today. 
The average European doesn’t have 
reason to applaud either. Joe Biden left 
out a few important facts in his speech 
in Europe. He forgot to mention he had 
given Vladimir Putin the green light to 
build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to 
Germany. He failed to mention that 
Putin can now hold half of Europe hos-
tage with natural gas. He failed to 
mention that today—today—in Amer-
ica, we are using more oil from Vladi-
mir Putin’s Russia than we are from 
the State of Alaska. 
Listen to this, Senators from Alaska, 
who follow these figures every day. The 
President failed to mention that he is 
actually asking Vladimir Putin to sell 
more oil to the United States, pump 
more oil, because he doesn’t want it 
produced in the United States, and he 
is willing to kill American jobs in the 
process. 
Well, due to the policies of this Presi-
dent and his radical attacks on Amer-
ican energy, Vladimir Putin has hit the 
jackpot, and he is going to cash in for 
years to come. 
Working families all across Europe 
know better. They have seen this 
movie before. That is why, this morn-
ing, I have released a report. I have it 
here. It is called ‘‘Europe’s Energy Cri-
sis: A Warning to America.’’ The sub-
headline: ‘‘Democrat plans to mimic 
Europe’s energy and climate policies 
will lead to sky-high prices, less reli-
ability, and shortages.’’ 
That is where President Biden is 
leading the United States. It is no won-
der that the national poll released last 
Sunday by NBC News showed only 22 
percent of the American people believe 
the country is heading in the right di-
rection under the Democrats and under 
this President. 
This report details how Europe has 
tried many of the environmental poli-
cies that the Democrats are proposing 
and want to pass today. The con-
sequences have been devastating to 
families there and will be devastating 
to families here. 
Because of the policies, Europeans 
are paying some of the highest energy 
prices in the world, and much of the 
energy they use is undependable and 
unreliable. 
Prices are really high in America 
right now, but they are even higher in 
Europe. This spring, gasoline prices 
were at least 65 percent higher in Eu-
rope than they were in America. From 
2005 to 2020, the cost of energy in 
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the 
United Kingdom increased between 28 
and 71 percent, depending on the coun-
try. 
European industries pay at least 90 
percent more for natural gas than 
American industries do. This is a major 
competitive advantage for American 
companies. Yet President Biden is 
doing everything he can to throw our 
competitive advantage away. 
This President is trying to pass legis-
lation that will make it worse here at 
home. The largest piece of the Presi-
dent’s spending bill is over $500 billion 
for the heavily criticized Green New 
Deal. It includes high payoffs for elec-
tric vehicle owners and an army of full- 
time climate activists that I just 
talked about. It includes higher taxes 
on American energy and higher prices 
for consumers. It would ban explo-
ration for oil and gas off our shores and 
in the Arctic. All of these ideas will 
raise costs additionally for working 
families. 
My new report shows that Europe al-
ready tried the Democrats’ environ-
mental policies. The results were disas-
trous for Europe. They will be disas-
trous here. 
I urge my Democratic colleagues: 
Don’t make this same mistake. Don’t 
subject the people of the United States 
to the same punishing pain of the high 
cost of energy that people are sus-
taining right now in Europe. Stop rais-
ing prices. Stop making life harder. 
The American people and American 
producers and American families de-
serve better. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. 
WICKER. 
Madam 
President, 
when we looked at the news this morn-
ing and we saw the evening news last 
night, when we tune in to the cable 
channels and we hear the radio, we see 
the astounding news of the voices of 
the voters on Tuesday of this week not 
just in Virginia and not just in New 
Jersey, but in the State of New York 
and throughout the Midwest and on 
over to the west coast. 
The American people sent a strong 
message of disapproval to the Biden ad-
ministration this week, and I hope our 
Democratic friends and the Biden ad-
ministration will heed the message of 
the voters. 
I normally don’t bring the New York 
Times to the floor and quote it with 
approval, but it says here in the New 
York Times this morning: ‘‘Bruised at 
Polls, 
Democrats 
Look 
at 
Their 
Missteps.’’ 
I hope that is true. I hope our Demo-
cratic colleagues and our friends in the 
Biden administration are looking at 
their missteps because they are many 
and they have been harmful. 
The Washington Post this morning, 
November 4, said: ‘‘A sharp turn looms 
in Virginia.’’ 
Yes, Virginia went from the three 
constitutional 
statewide 
offices 
all 
being held by Democrats to a Repub-
lican sweep, not only there but in the 
State General Assembly. 
But then I see this other headline at 
the top of the page: ‘‘Democrats race 
ahead on fiscal proposals.’’ 
Presumably, our Democrat friends 
are not hearing the message that the 
American people in State after State 
after State sent just Tuesday of this 
week. 
Even vastly underfunded GOP can-
didates, like the candidate for Gov-
ernor in New Jersey, came within a 
hair’s breadth of being elected. Vastly 
underfunded GOP candidates for legis-
lative positions actually prevailed over 
candidates with millions and millions 
of dollars on the Democratic side. 
The American people have sent this 
administration and this Democratic 
majority in the House and this tiny 
Democratic majority in the Senate a 
very unmistakable message. They are 
rejecting the malaise that we are 
under. And the Biden administration 
must understand that this election was 
the direct result of the President’s 
failed agenda. 
By all measures, our economy should 
be roaring by now. We are coming out 
of the pandemic. We should be back to 
the good news of February 2020, the 
month before the pandemic hit. The 
Trump and Republican tax cuts were in 
place. The unemployment rate was an 
astoundingly low 3.6 percent, some-
thing that we were told in our econom-
ics classes was impossible in the United

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7774 
November 4, 2021 
States of America. When I was taking 
kiddy economics, they said it couldn’t 
go below 4 percent. 
The unemployment rate in February 
of 2020 was 3.6 percent. Employment 
was up among women. Employment 
was up among minorities. Employment 
was up among veterans. Our economy 
was roaring. 
And then the pandemic came, and we 
acted in a bipartisan way. But we are 
coming out of the pandemic now, and 
the administration acts as if we need a 
huge 
dose—$4 
trillion, 
$5 
trillion 
worth—of socialism. 
The pandemic is in full retreat, and 
from the beginning of the administra-
tion this year, the Biden administra-
tion blew it. On day one, the President 
canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, 
killing thousands of jobs, and almost in 
the same breath, he told the Russians 
to go ahead with their pipeline. 
I mean, can Americans even grasp 
that? 
I think they sent a message Tuesday 
about that sort of thing. 
With the stroke of a pen, the Presi-
dent declared war on American energy. 
The result has been that fuel has be-
come scarce, and, of course, because of 
its scarcity, it has become more expen-
sive. After 4 years of relief under the 
last administration, U.S. energy pro-
ducers are once again looking down the 
barrel of a hostile EPA. 
This is a self-inflicted energy crisis. 
Coal and nuclear plants are shutting 
down as reliable natural resources are 
taken off the table, replaced by its ad-
ministration’s fantasy dream of green- 
only energy. 
Taxpayers are being told to stomach 
higher gas prices while, at the same 
time, being asked to pay billions of 
dollars to subsidize wind, solar, and 
electric vehicles. There is a place for 
that, but they are all three unreliable. 
And, 
predictably, 
gas 
prices 
have 
soared. 
Instead of reevaluating his own poli-
cies, it seems that the President is at-
tempting to double down on them, and 
he has even gone to questionable gov-
ernments across the sea in the Middle 
East asking them to produce more oil 
because we won’t do that in the United 
States. It makes no sense at all. 
Perhaps this administration should 
listen to the election results and hear 
the voices of the people from Tuesday. 
But the economic damage is hardly 
limited to energy. Inflation spurred on 
by the administration’s reckless spend-
ing is burning a hole in the wallets of 
Americans, and we simply can’t get 
around it. The Consumer Price Index 
shows one thing, that prices have gone 
up 5.4 percent over the last 12 months. 
Well, I will tell you, Madam Presi-
dent, I was speaking to a manufacturer 
from my home State of Mississippi just 
yesterday, and he said that figure is 
understated quite a bit. He said his 
costs have gone up around 20 percent in 
being able to manufacture goods for 
American people and hire Americans 
and hire Mississippians. 
Meanwhile, the gears of our economy 
are slowing down, causing fears of stag-
flation, something we have not seen 
since the 1970s. 
And I do want to agree with my 
friend from Wyoming about the gen-
tleman from Illinois’ point about the 
Climate Corps. This manufacturer in 
Mississippi said he has got 2,000 posi-
tions that need to be filled. Perhaps 
some of these people that the Senator 
from Illinois would like to employ in 
the Climate Corps can come to manu-
facturers like ours in Mississippi and 
take a good-paying job manufacturing 
things for Americans that we can sell 
in our country and all around the 
world. 
GDP growth just slowed to 2 percent. 
Employers still cannot find enough 
workers, just like the manufacturer 
from Mississippi told me yesterday. 
Our supply chain is jammed up with 
endless delays, causing concern. 
But, to me, one of the most serious 
and dangerous policies of this adminis-
tration is the Biden administration’s 
unprecedented 
and 
unconstitutional 
vaccine mandate on two-thirds of the 
private-sector workforce. We are being 
told that every employer with over 100 
employees must comply with a Wash-
ington-mandated and unconstitutional 
vaccine mandate. 
This is exactly what the President 
said 11 months ago he didn’t want to 
do. Joe Biden was asked in December of 
2020: Should vaccines be mandated? 
And he said: ‘‘No, I don’t think they 
should be mandatory.’’ 
The President was right when he said 
that to the press, and he is 180 degrees 
wrong today and taking his cues from 
the most radical advisers that he has. 
As a result, the American people, on 
Tuesday, have said: Enough. 
Now, I know a little about American 
workers. I know a little about Amer-
ican service men and women. I was one. 
We have been raised in a free country, 
in a free land, and we are not accus-
tomed to being told by Washington, 
DC, by the Chief Executive of the 
United States of America, what we 
must put in our bodies. 
And I can tell you, this is a looming 
economic crisis for this country. Mil-
lions and millions of hard-working 
American taxpayers are going to be 
forced to leave their jobs because they 
will refuse, as free Americans, to be 
told that they must take a vaccine 
that they do not feel good about. 
Madam President, the Chief Execu-
tive of our land has grossly miscalcu-
lated the American people on this 
issue, and a looming economic crisis 
because of a lack of workers and mass 
layoffs and mass firings is about to 
occur. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
should 
pause, do what the New York Times 
said this morning and, as they are ex-
amining their bruises, look at their 
missteps because they are many and 
they are hurting the American econ-
omy. 
I would urge the Biden administra-
tion to let these tax cuts stay in place, 
to let these soft-touch regulations stay 
in place, to pause and listen to the 
clear voices of the American people as 
they voted in strong numbers this past 
Tuesday. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATION OF SAULE OMAROVA 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, on 
Tuesday, the President of the United 
States officially nominated Cornell 
Law Professor Saule Omarova to be 
America’s top banking regulator. She 
would be the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency. The Comptroller of the Currency 
is the lead regulator of all of our na-
tional banks. 
Now, twice before today, I addressed 
her nomination on the Senate floor— 
her then-prospective nomination. Now 
she has been nominated. And I noted 
that Professor Omarova describes her 
own views as radical. For example, 
Professor Omarova has written that 
she wants to ‘‘radically redefine the 
role of a central bank.’’ She has also 
stated that her proposals represent a 
‘‘radical departure from what we’ve 
been conditioned to view as the ‘nor-
mal’ state of play.’’ 
Madam President, probably the only 
thing I can think of in all of her writ-
ing that I agree with is her character-
ization of her views as radical. Specifi-
cally, let me be clear about what is 
radical about her whole approach. It is 
radical because she has a clear and ob-
vious aversion to democratic cap-
italism itself, in other words, the cen-
tral organizing principle of American 
society that we would be a free society 
and that that would include economic 
freedom and economic decisions can be 
made by free men and women pursuing 
their own understanding of their self- 
interest. 
Instead of that, she has a clear pref-
erence for an administrative approach 
where decisions are not made by free 
men and women engaging voluntarily 
in exchanges but, rather, by tech-
nocrats who are deemed to know what 
is better for us than we could possibly 
know for ourselves. 
The fact is, in my 11 years in Con-
gress, I don’t think I have seen a more 
radical nominee for any regulatory 
spot in our entire Federal Government. 
And I know that is a bold statement, 
but I stand by that. 
Now, last month, I spoke about Pro-
fessor Omarova’s radical plan to have 
the Federal Government set prices 
throughout our economy. She wants 
the government to decide what people 
should pay for food and gas and wages 
and home prices and many other 
things. That is pretty radical. 
Today, I want to focus on her radical 
proposal to nationalize the U.S. bank-
ing system. So let me first start by ob-
serving that Professor Omarova’s plan 
to nationalize our financial system 
wasn’t something that she wrote dec-
ades ago or even years ago. In fact, I 
believe she wrote it last year, and it 
was published in the Vanderbilt Law 
Review just last month.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7775 
November 4, 2021 
Professor Omarova’s radical plan to 
nationalize financial services was pub-
lished just last month, and the paper 
was titled ‘‘The People’s Ledger: How 
to Democratize Money and Finance the 
Economy.’’ 
‘‘The People’s Ledger.’’ Not the peo-
ple’s Republic, mind you, but ‘‘The 
People’s Ledger.’’ That is her title for 
the paper. 
In the paper, Professor Omarova out-
lined her plan to ‘‘effectively end bank-
ing as we know it.’’ 
Now, that is a very strong statement. 
So what exactly does she mean by this? 
Well, she lays this out for us. 
In her proposal, the Federal Govern-
ment would become the retail bank for 
every American. That is right. It has 
essentially two features. She would 
have the creation of retail deposit ac-
counts at the Fed for every American 
citizen and the issuance of a central 
bank digital currency to manage this 
in various ways. 
The objective of this plan—these are 
her words—the objective is to ‘‘re-
imagine the role of a central bank as 
the ultimate public platform for gener-
ating, modulating, and allocating fi-
nancial resources in a modern econ-
omy.’’ Think about that. We want the 
central government to be allocating fi-
nancial resources in a modern econ-
omy. Those are not my words; those 
are her words. 
In its role as the ‘‘ultimate public 
platform,’’ 
according 
to 
Professor 
Omarova, 
‘‘central 
bank 
accounts 
[would] 
fully 
replace—rather 
than 
uneasily co-exist with—private bank 
deposits.’’ These are her words. She 
wants to fully replace all of the private 
accounts that we have. So, in other 
words, if you have a bank account with 
a local community bank, no more; 
couldn’t have that uneasily—what is 
her word?—uneasily coexisting. That 
would be replaced. Your money would 
be with the Federal Reserve instead. 
So Professor Omarova’s view is to 
put the Fed in charge of handling all of 
our bank deposits, all of our bank ac-
counts. So when a hard-working Amer-
ican receives their paycheck every 
week, it doesn’t go in direct deposit to 
the community bank with which you 
are accustomed to doing business; it 
would go to a government-controlled 
bank account with the Fed. 
Professor Omarova’s proposal would 
‘‘envision the complete migration of 
demand deposit accounts to the Fed’s 
balance sheet.’’ So lest anyone suggest 
I am exaggerating about her plan to re-
place all banking, these are her words: 
‘‘the complete migration of demand de-
posit accounts to the Fed’s balance 
sheet.’’ 
Now, why does Professor Omarova 
propose that we destroy banking in 
America and shift all deposit accounts 
from the innumerable private institu-
tions that we all use and do it all 
through the Fed? Well, one reason she 
cites is to empower the Fed to directly 
distribute fiscal stimulus and aid to 
worthy beneficiaries. I kind of wonder 
who the radical left would consider to 
be sufficiently worthy to be a bene-
ficiary, but that is another whole 
topic. 
Another justification that she offers 
for the Fed to control all retail bank-
ing—really, for Fed to be America’s 
sole retail bank—is so that the Fed can 
more easily control the money supply. 
This is very interesting. She provides 
a little insight into how she envisions 
this because she says this would in-
clude ‘‘implementing a contractionary 
monetary policy by debiting’’ con-
sumers’ accounts. Now, she allows that 
this could ‘‘be perceived as the govern-
ment ‘taking away’ people’s money.’’ 
Why would people perceive it as the 
government 
taking 
away 
people’s 
money? Because that is exactly what 
she is saying should be an option avail-
able to the Fed. 
So specifically what she is saying is 
that all Americans’ deposits must be at 
the Fed. There can be no private banks. 
That would be an uneasy coexistence 
we shouldn’t tolerate. And then, if the 
Fed causes inflation, which is the usual 
source of inflation, no problem—the 
Fed can solve the problem by confis-
cating a little bit of the money from 
everybody’s accounts. 
Imagine this. That is exactly what 
she is advocating. The Fed can create 
inflation, but that is all right—we will 
give it a new tool to solve the inflation 
problem: just confiscate the money 
from the American citizens who are 
forced to put their money with the 
Fed. You can’t make this stuff up. This 
is what she is advocating. 
That is not the only reason she wants 
the Fed to be everyone’s bank. She 
says it is to ‘‘maximize [the Fed’s] ca-
pacity to channel credit to productive 
uses in the nation’s economy.’’ This is 
the definition of ‘‘socialist hubris.’’ 
This is the definition of ‘‘socialism’’— 
the idea that we have the government 
allocate the resources. Let the govern-
ment decide what is the productive 
way to use the resources of our society 
rather than individual men and women 
by virtue of the exchanges they volun-
tarily choose to engage in. She wants 
to substitute a centrally managed, 
planned socialist economy for the free 
society that we have today. There is no 
other way to characterize it. 
Where has this ever worked? This is 
unbelievable. If it were possible, which 
it is not, how would the Fed decide 
which are the productive and the non-
productive uses? What about loans to 
energy companies? Gee, I don’t know. 
Is that productive or is that not pro-
ductive? Let’s leave to it the Fed to de-
cide. What could possibly go wrong? 
Here is another reason why it is very 
bad to force all Americans to do their 
retail banking with a central govern-
ment. It is the end to privacy for 
Americans’ 
financial 
transactions. 
That is over. 
We remember just weeks ago the tre-
mendous backlash against the idea 
that banks would be required to report 
aggregate transaction information to 
the IRS. I know I got buried with 
phone calls and letters. I think we had 
16,000 Pennsylvanians who reached out 
to my office alone, urging Congress to 
reject that proposal. Can you imagine 
what people will think of Professor 
Omarova’s plan to force you to have 
your whole bank account with the Fed? 
Americans don’t want the Federal 
Government monitoring their bank ac-
counts. I should think that would be 
obvious. They certainly don’t want the 
Federal Government having control 
over this. 
Let me conclude with this: It is per-
fectly OK for academic institutions and 
think tanks to have people espousing 
these socialist ideas and spinning all 
different variations on these collec-
tivists and centrally planned and so-
cialist themes. It is perfectly fine. 
That should be debated. I am not in the 
camp that thinks you cancel someone 
who has a different point of view from 
being able to articulate what they be-
lieve in. But the idea that we would 
take someone who holds these socialist 
views, who is so strongly anti-cap-
italism, and put that person as the 
chief regulator of America’s banks— 
that makes no sense at all. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
nominee. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3170 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have intro-
duced 12 bills against President Biden’s 
vaccine mandate. Most of these bills 
should 
have 
been 
supremely 
non-
controversial. Some of the bills would 
have made sure that the exemptions 
President Biden announced were actu-
ally efficacious in the final mandate. 
Another bill would have made sure 
that the government didn’t vaccinate 
children without the consent of their 
parents. Yet another would have pro-
vided transparency to the American 
people on exactly how their tax dollars 
are being used in this area. 
Lamentably, each time I asked that 
one of these bills pass this body, one of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle objected. They determined that 
legislation protecting religious, med-
ical, and moral exceptions to the man-
date were not helpful. They decided 
that the American people do not de-
serve to understand how their tax dol-
lars are funding research or COVID re-
lief. They declared that laws protecting 
parents’ rights to make the best deci-
sions for their kids were somehow un-
necessary. 
On each of these issues, the American 
people, of course, begged significantly 
to differ. Americans don’t appreciate it 
when their government takes decisions 
out of their hands. As elections this 
week showed, parents want a voice in 
their children’s education, and they 
certainly want to be respected when it 
comes to medical decisions involving 
and affecting their children as directly 
as this one does. 
Crippling inflation and polling data 
on Americans’ economic outlook show

November 4, 2021 
that people want government to be 
more responsible and more transparent 
in how it oversees their tax dollars and 
how it spends them. Those on the other 
side of the aisle who have objected per-
haps aren’t getting that particular 
message. And how tragic that is. 
I have heard from hundreds of Utahns 
in recent days who are at risk of losing 
their livelihoods under the mandate. 
Many of these individuals are military 
servicemembers and first responders. 
Others are key workers. Many have le-
gitimate medical or religious reasons 
not to be vaccinated. But each one of 
them is an everyday American. These 
are mothers and fathers. They live in 
our communities. They are people we 
call friends and neighbors. In today’s 
economy, all too many of them are 
struggling just to get by. Forcing them 
out of work will put an unimaginable 
strain on their families and on our 
economy at a time when they can’t af-
ford to face additional strains, cer-
tainly not one imposed by the Federal 
Government. 
Additionally, 
I 
have 
heard 
from 
countless businesses that are worried 
about keeping their doors open should 
the mandate require them to fire key 
members of their workforce, that this 
just isn’t tolerable. These businesses 
are already under tremendous strain 
due to the supply chain crisis and infla-
tion and the labor shortage. They fear 
that they will be unable to operate 
should the mandate take effect. Every 
American—every 
single 
American— 
would suffer if these key industries 
were to shut down. 
Now, some might say these impacts 
are far away. Others still might claim 
that because the mandate has not yet 
taken effect, these impacts aren’t real 
or worth worrying about today. I don’t 
think that is true. In fact, nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
Now, it is true that President Biden’s 
vaccine mandate is yet to be officially 
published in the Federal Register. How-
ever, it will be tomorrow. The unpub-
lished version of the mandate can now 
be found, as of a few hours ago, and 
here is some of what it entails: 
If employers have 100 or more em-
ployees, they must ensure that their 
workers are either fully vaccinated 
against COVID–19 by December 5 or 
that workers test negative for COVID 
at least once a week by January 4. If an 
employer has an employee who has yet 
to be vaccinated, President Biden is re-
quiring the employer to pay workers 
for the time it takes to get vaccinated 
and provide sick leave for workers to 
recover from any side effects. 
What happens if businesses don’t 
comply? Well, President Biden has 
threatened them with a nearly $14,000 
fine per violation, per person, per day. 
This is an administrative nightmare 
and nothing short of it. 
If employees don’t want to be vac-
cinated against COVID–19, then they 
must pay for the testing. American 
workers will be on the hook, and it is 
not something most Americans can af-
ford. 
Mr. President, seeing that we have a 
vote approaching, I ask unanimous 
consent that Senator PETERS and I be 
able to speak for a period of time not 
to exceed an additional 5 minutes to 
complete our remarks. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. LEE. So today I am offering a 
bill that would help with this situa-
tion. My No Forced Vaccination for 
COVID–19 Act would prevent the Presi-
dent of the United States or any execu-
tive branch agency from issuing a gen-
eral vaccine mandate, including a man-
date that requires an individual to be 
vaccinated or undergo periodic testing. 
It would end this extraordinary night-
mare for millions of Americans and 
key businesses. It would put this sorry, 
mean, cruel saga to an end. 
The people of Utah and the United 
States will rest easy if this bill passes. 
We would be able to focus on encour-
aging vaccination in reasonable, ac-
ceptable, and constitutional ways. I 
think this is what we all want. 
Ultimately, I believe in these vac-
cines. I am fully vaccinated. I have en-
couraged everyone around me to be 
vaccinated. I believe these vaccines are 
helping to protect millions of Ameri-
cans from the harms of COVID. What is 
not helping Americans is President 
Biden’s mandate. We can fix that 
today. That is why I am encouraging 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
To that end, Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 3170, 
which is at the desk. I ask further that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PETERS. Objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Objection is heard. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I re-
serve the right to object. 
This bill would be a step backwards 
in our country’s fight against the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Across this country, we have seen 
over 45 million cases of COVID–19 and 
almost 750,000 deaths. Communities— 
and 
particularly 
communities 
of 
color—have been hit hard by this virus. 
But, luckily, we have a safe and ef-
fective way to help prevent the spread 
of the virus: vaccines. 
So far, almost 60 percent of U.S. pop-
ulation has been fully vaccinated. How-
ever, the virus continues to spread. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention classified over 70 percent of our 
counties are having high transmission 
rates. Conversely, less than 2 percent 
are classified as low transmission. In 
order for us to beat this virus, we need 
to reach higher levels of vaccine rates 
and put a stop to community spread. 
This bill would bar executive agen-
cies from being able to mandate that 
individuals receive the COVID–19 vac-
cine or even mandate that an indi-
vidual agree to undergo periodic test-
ing for COVID–19 in lieu of a vaccine. 
The science is clear: Vaccines are 
safe, they are effective, and they save 
lives. 
Rather than wasting time on par-
tisan bills that make our country less 
safe, we should be finding ways to en-
sure an equitable recovery for all of 
our communities and preparing for the 
next public health emergency. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this isn’t 
about whether we are against the 
virus; we are. It is not about whether 
we are for the vaccine; we are. It is 
about the fact that only 14 percent of 
Americans believe that it is fair, just, 
and proper to fire someone because 
they refuse to get the vaccine. 
It is not appropriate for the Presi-
dent of the United States or this gov-
ernment to be ordering everyone to be 
fired, removing someone from their 
ability to put bread on the table for 
their children. It is immoral. It is 
wrong. It is without foundation and 
law. It is contrary to the constitu-
tional word. This is shameful. I will be 
back and I won’t stop until we are fin-
ished. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT LUIS SANTOS 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of the nomination of Robert L. 
Santos to be the Director of the Census 
Bureau. 
Mr. Santos is uniquely qualified to 
lead the Census Bureau as it carries 
out its important work serving as the 
leading source of quality data about 
the Nation’s people and economy. He 
brings over 40 years of experience in 
both the public and private sectors as a 
manager and expert in the field of sur-
vey design and statistical research. 
Throughout his career, Mr. Santos 
has interacted closely with the Census 
Bureau as a researcher, a stakeholder, 
and an expert adviser, serving on the 
Census Advisory Committee and Na-
tional Academies panels on Federal 
statistics. He has a deep understanding 
of the Census Bureau, its data, and its 
stakeholders. 
Throughout the nomination process, 
Mr. Santos has demonstrated a firm 
commitment to upholding the Bureau’s 
mission of producing the essential 
high-quality data that our commu-
nities, our businesses, and people all 
across our Nation rely on. 
As the Census Bureau completes the 
2020 census, plans for the 2030 census, 
and administers the Bureau’s crucial 
demographic surveys, it is absolutely 
critical for the Agency to have a quali-
fied Senate-confirmed leader at the 
helm. 
I would urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting the confirmation of

LOCAL JOURNALISM SUSTAINABILITY ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the 
Local Journalism Sustainability Act. 
And 
before 
the 
majority 
leader 
leaves, I want to thank him for his 
leadership on such an important piece 
of legislation. From the very begin-
ning, he understood the fact that diver-
sity in resources is about competition 
and is a key part of our democracy, and 
we wouldn’t be at the precipice of get-
ting support for local journalism with-
out his help. So I thank him for that. 
We originally introduced legislation 
here in the Senate that Senators 
WYDEN, KELLY, SCHATZ, MARKEY, MUR-
RAY, KLOBUCHAR, my colleague Senator 
SCHUMER, MANCHIN, CORTEZ
MASTO, 
SINEMA, BALDWIN, LUJ´AN, LEAHY, and 
BLUMENTHAL all supported. 
This is important legislation. We 
hope our House colleagues will take 
this up this afternoon or tomorrow, as 
it is included in the Build Back Better 
program, to make sure that we have 
the free press that is essential to our 
democracy and that we have true com-
petition. 
Local news is a trusted source of 
news. Working to high journalistic 
standards, local newspapers and broad-
casters play a critical role in holding 
our elected officials accountable, shin-
ing a spotlight on important news, and 
challenging the issues of our commu-
nity to come to light. As one friend of 
mine said, local news is like hanging a 
lantern on a problem so that the light 
shines through. 
That is exactly why we want to make 
sure that we continue to support hav-
ing this diversity of voices, especially 
while we see in the online world unfair 
and uncompetitive practices that we 
know will be discussed by our col-
leagues, looked at by the Department 
of Justice, and certainly legislation 
proposed about. But in the meantime, 
we want to keep this diversity of voices 
working. 
We know that since 2005, newspapers 
have lost more than 40,000 newsroom 
employees—about 60 percent of their 
workforce. Most States have lost more 
than 50 percent of their newsroom 
workforce. We cannot let regional and 
community news organizations con-
tinue to die as we navigate very chal-
lenging 
information-age 
business 
issues. That is why this legislation is 
so important. 
Local journalism is highly trusted in 
communities around the country. Ac-
cording to a 2019 study from Gallup and 
Knight Foundation, Americans trust 
local news over national news by a 2- 
to-1 margin to ‘‘report the news with-
out bias.’’ Local journalism has devel-
oped that trust based on transparency, 
accuracy, ethical reporting, and shin-
ing a light on important issues, includ-
ing crime and corruption, and holding 
public officials accountable. 
Local news reporting takes national 
news stories and translates them into 
their community news, and America’s 
newspapers and online journalists and 
radio and television broadcasters are at 
the heart of this media landscape. 
During the pandemic, broadcasters 
continued to provide essential informa-
tion to audiences, reporting the news 
and helping us keep connected on such 
an important issue. 
The Local Journalism Sustainability 
Act is essential to maintaining that 
trust, that diversity of voices, and that 
local perspective. The tax incentives in 
this bill will help local newspapers and 
digital-only 
news 
journalists 
and 
broadcast newsrooms remain finan-
cially viable to retain and hire local- 
based journalists to cover local news 
stories. 
This bill helps incentivize newspapers 
and 
broadcasters, 
including 
those 
owned by larger entities, to invest in 
reporting local news to their relevant 
communities. 
Local and regional minority-owned 
businesses and outlets also benefit 
from this provision, which is one of the 
reasons 
why 
the 
association 
rep-
resenting the Black press, the National 
Newspaper Publishers Association, and 
the National Association of Hispanic 
Publications also support this legisla-
tion. 
America’s democracy really does de-
pend on ensuring that we have access 
to information and that we have in-
formed decisions. Doing so also means 
that we have true competition and in-
formation 
and 
news 
that 
can 
be 
verified. 
So I am pleased that the House has 
incorporated this important provision 
into the Build Back Better reconcili-
ation program. I hope that when this 
comes to the Senate, our colleagues 
will join in supporting this, in helping 
local newspapers, radio and television 
stations, and digital journalists con-
tinue to help us get the news. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

SUNSHINE PROTECTION ACT OF 2021 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today because it is time to 
make daylight saving time permanent. 
This Sunday, millions of Americans 
are going to once again roll their 
clocks back, and in no time, next 
spring, they will have to roll their 
clocks forward. For what reason? I 
don’t know a single person who loves 
to go through the trouble of figuring 
out whether their microwave or their 
oven has the hour right or anyone who 
looks forward to the Sun setting ear-
lier and earlier every winter. 
But beyond convenience, this really 
is a matter of health and safety. Stud-
ies have shown that our switch to 
standard time can increase rates of 
seasonal depression, as well as heart 
problems and the risk of stroke. Re-
searchers also believe that if we made 
daylight saving time permanent, there 
would be fewer car accidents and 
evening robberies thanks to a more 
regular schedule and an extra hour of 
Sun. 
There are studies that indicate per-
manent daylight saving time could off-
set reduced economic activity that we 
see during standard time and even 
would lead to greater energy savings. 
The people in my home State of 
Washington know this. That is why we 
have already passed legislation to 
switch to permanent daylight saving 
time. And it is not just Washington; 
States across the country—Florida and 
California and Maine and many more— 
have now passed legislation in their 
States or resolutions to make daylight 
saving time year-round. But they are 
powerless to enact the overwhelming 
will of the people until they get Fed-
eral approval. 
To put it simply, Americans want 
more sunshine and less depression. 
That is actually why I am very proud 
to cosponsor the bipartisan Sunshine 
Protection Act of 2021, which would ex-
tend Daylight Saving Time perma-
nently so Americans can enjoy having 
sunlight during their most productive 
hour of the day and never have to 
worry about changing their clocks 
again. 
Congress has to be part of the solu-
tion. Here is a bipartisan issue that we 
can and we should all get behind. 
Now, I am working very hard to sup-
port the passage of this bill however 
possible. But this is something my con-
stituents are truly fed up with, so I am 
also pressing the Department of Trans-
portation to explore every avenue 
available to them to at least let 
States—like mine, whose voters over-
whelmingly want permanent Daylight 
Saving Time—have it. 
(Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the 
Chair.) 
Madam President, in this country, 
when people have demanded changes to 
daylight saving rules or if it benefits 
the country, like saving daylight dur-
ing World War I or the oil embargo in 
the 1970s, we have simply just changed 
the rules. 
No one wants dark afternoons during 
the winter or to lose an extra hour of 
sleep every spring. And I can assure 
you that every parent that has to deal 
with a child every time we change the 
clock and it upsets their routines will 
be behind this. 
For goodness’ sake, voters across the 
country have shown that they support

public health; and studies actually 
demonstrate real economic and energy 
saving benefits. 
So, Madam President, I urge that we 
pass the Sunshine Protection Act and 
finally make Daylight Saving Time 
permanent. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska is recognized. 
CHINA 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, 50 
years ago this coming February, Presi-
dent Nixon made history as the first 
American President to visit the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China. He thought 
that by inviting China to join what he 
called ‘‘the family of nations,’’ he 
could incentivize the Chinese Com-
munist Party to liberalize at home and 
refrain from exporting its brand of 
communism abroad. 
That may sound naive because, as we 
look back on those 50 years, the 
changes President Nixon hoped for 
never came. But he held out hope for 
change because he had faith in the Chi-
nese people. He was an incredible ad-
mirer of their culture and their re-
markable history. 
And even though these past few dec-
ades have proven Nixon wrong about 
the CCP, he was right to have faith in 
the people of China. That is why we 
have to be specific when we talk about 
what the future holds for our two coun-
tries. 
The Chinese people and the Chinese 
Communist Party are not the same 
thing. In fact, the opposite is true. We 
have seen countless examples of the 
Chinese people’s bravery, from pro-de-
mocracy demonstrations in Hong Kong 
to 1989’s protests in Tiananmen Square. 
They were born deserving the same 
universal rights that we enjoy in the 
United States: freedom of speech, as-
sembly, religion, and so many more. 
They deserve to live in a country 
that recognizes those rights and under-
stands that true power comes from the 
consent of the governed, not from the 
iron fist of the party oligarchy. 
Unfortunately, that iron fist is how 
the CCP has kept its grip on power for 
so many decades, and they have shown 
no signs of slowing down under Presi-
dent Xi Jinping. 
As we approach the 50th anniversary 
of President Nixon’s groundbreaking 
trip, we need to reflect on what those 
50 years have brought us. 
China has not become a democracy. 
Instead, 
the 
Communist 
Party 
is 
weaponizing new technologies to con-
solidate 
their 
rule. 
Through 
what 
President Biden’s chief adviser for 
Asia, Kurt Campbell, has called digital 
authoritarianism, the CCP can now 
track the Chinese people’s every move-
ment with facial recognition. They 
have developed a social credit system 
that ranks the likability and trust-
worthiness of hundreds of millions of 
Chinese citizens. Using these and other 
technologies, the CCP is committing 
genocide against their own people. 
Since April 2017, the CCP has de-
tained over 1 million leaders and other 
Muslims in specially built internment 
camps in Xinjiang province. These are 
Chinese citizens, and their own govern-
ment is subjecting them to forced ster-
ilization, sexual abuse, forced labor, 
physical and psychological torment, 
and political indoctrination. 
This is government-sponsored ethnic 
cleansing, and now China is starting to 
carry out this kind of state-sponsored 
racism and genocide outside Xingjiang. 
In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region, the CCP is curtailing the use of 
the Mongolian language by shutting 
down Mongolian-language social media 
websites and prohibiting schools from 
teaching certain classes in Mongolian. 
The next steps could be similar to what 
we have seen in Xinjiang. 
Sadly, ethnic minorities are not the 
only people to find themselves on the 
wrong side of the CCP’s many abuses of 
power. Under President Xi, China has 
broken its promises to the free people 
of Hong Kong. Under the pretense of 
protecting national security, new laws 
have led to the arrest of thousands of 
people for doing nothing more than ex-
ercising their God-given rights. 
Taken together, all these things 
paint a picture of a Chinese Govern-
ment that is doubling down on its com-
munist roots and doing whatever it 
takes to control its people. 
None of this should surprise us. This 
is the same government that forcibly 
sterilized its citizens as part of its one- 
child policy, and gunned down thou-
sands of students who were peacefully 
protesting in Tiananmen Square. 
And now they are turning their at-
tention abroad. They are growing more 
aggressive towards other countries by 
the day, in ways that comply with 
international norms and in ways that 
defy those norms. 
In 
2013, 
President 
Xi 
formally 
launched his signature foreign policy 
effort: the Belt and Road Initiative. 
Through this program, China offers 
lucrative infrastructure investments 
and economic development deals to 
smaller and poorer nations. The ulti-
mate goal is to create a global coali-
tion that could challenge the long-
standing network of alliances and part-
nerships that have been built by the 
United States. Since Belt and Road 
began, 139 countries have joined, and 
on every continent China is using it to 
expand their power. 
But here is the catch: If developing 
countries that welcomed these invest-
ments want construction to continue 
on their new highway system or sky-
scraper, or if they want access to fund-
ing for future projects, they cannot 
speak out against China’s actions. This 
is why leaders of Muslim-majority 
countries who have spoken out against 
these crimes in the past have suddenly 
fallen silent. 
Just 
look 
at 
Turkish 
President 
Erdogan, 
who 
said 
China’s 
crimes 
against the Uighurs are ‘‘a genocide, 
and there is no point in interpreting 
this otherwise.’’ 
He said that in 2009. Today, he won’t 
even talk about it, and he has ordered 
the police to break up protests about 
these atrocities in Turkey. 
Pakistan’s Prime Minister, usually a 
champion for Muslims around the 
world, has also fallen under Belt and 
Road’s spell. In June, he refused to an-
swer questions about Xinjiang in an 
interview with Axios’s Jonathan Swan. 
China’s other strategies for reshaping 
the rules-based international order are 
far less subtle. They are using the in-
frastructure they build to spy on for-
eign leaders or even take over disputed 
regions in neighboring countries. 
In Ethiopia, the CCP offered to build 
the new headquarters of the African 
Union. African Union workers soon dis-
covered that the building’s Huawei 
servers had been shipping their data to 
Shanghai every day for years and that 
the building was riddled with Chinese 
surveillance devices. 
This is a perfect example of China’s 
strategy of military-civilian fusion, or 
the way the CCP forces so-called ‘‘pri-
vate’’ corporations like Huawei to do 
their bidding. 
Another example hit much closer to 
home. In 2016, the Chinese company 
with CCP ties tried to buy a hotel in 
San Diego. Well, the hotel has a view of 
Naval Base San Diego, the home port 
of the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet. The 
deal was ultimately blocked, but the 
fact that such a transparent attempt to 
keep an eye on our forces almost went 
through is cause for serious concern. 
China is also building artificial is-
lands in the disputed South China Sea. 
Many in this body will recall when, in 
2015, President Xi stood next to Presi-
dent Obama and he lied, saying that 
China does not intend to militarize 
those islands. He broke his pledge with-
in a year. 
Along with this geographic expan-
sion, President Xi is investing in Chi-
na’s military. According to the Center 
for Strategic and International Stud-
ies, China now spends nearly three 
times as much on the People’s Libera-
tion Army as they did just 10 years 
ago. They now have the world’s largest 
navy in terms of total number of ships, 
a title the U.S. held until 2 years ago. 
China’s 
navy 
currently 
numbers 
about 355 ships and submarines. They 
have 2 aircraft carriers and at least 32 
destroyers, 48 frigates, and 65 attack 
submarines. This is not a navy de-
signed to protect a coastline; this is a 
navy designed to project force on a 
global scale. 
Former Deputy National Security 
Advisor Matthew Pottinger called what 
China is doing the ‘‘largest peacetime 
military buildup in the modern era, 
and maybe one of the largest in his-
tory.’’ He said that in response to my 
questions at a Senate Armed Services 
Committee hearing earlier in June. 
And what is this new, more powerful 
military’s highest priority? 
The peaceful island of democracy, 
Taiwan. President Xi has been very 
clear about his desire to bring Taiwan

under the CCP’s control. The only 
thing stopping him is 100 miles of 
ocean: the Taiwan Strait. 
But the CCP’s ambitions won’t end 
with 
Taiwan. 
India, 
Japan, 
South 
Korea, and many countries in the 
South China Sea are feeling the effects 
of China’s aggression in ways no one 
expected even a decade ago. And to 
back up their global agenda, the CCP is 
hard at work expanding China’s nu-
clear arsenal. 
As Admiral Richard, the commander 
of STRATCOM, wrote earlier this year: 
China’s nuclear weapon stockpile is ex-
pected to double—if not triple or quadruple— 
over the next decade. 
A new report out yesterday from the 
Pentagon paints a worse picture. It 
predicts that China could have at least 
1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, roughly 
five times what they have now. As part 
of this expansion, China is building at 
least three new missile fields, each ca-
pable of holding over 100 ICBMs. And 
maybe most concerning, China re-
cently tested an extremely sophisti-
cated new weapons system that com-
bines space capabilities with advanced 
hypersonics. This nuclear capable pro-
totype could give China a unique edge 
over our own arsenal. 
Madam President, this needs to be a 
wake-up call for us. We must change 
our approach to China. We can’t keep 
pretending that these problems don’t 
exist. 
Thankfully, concern about China’s 
rise is an area of bipartisan consensus 
here in Congress. But recognizing that 
there is a problem is not enough. We 
have to get our act together and we 
have to do something about it. There 
are many ways for us to push back 
against the CCP, but, by far, the most 
fundamental thing we can do to safe-
guard against China’s rise is to invest 
in our military. 
The 
old 
adage 
‘‘peace 
through 
strength’’ still applies today, but the 
Biden 
administration 
has 
proposed 
raising defense spending by only 1.6 
percent, and taking this year’s infla-
tion into account, that means we have 
a proposed cut. That defies basic logic. 
The world is not getting safer. Threats 
like China are not going away. 
When we met earlier this year to re-
view the President’s budget request 
and write our annual defense author-
ization bill, the Senate Armed Services 
Committee debated defense cuts. 
What was the result? 
A huge bipartisan majority—25 of the 
26 members—voted to authorize an ad-
ditional $25 billion in defense spending, 
which primarily supported the un-
funded priorities of our commanders. 
This provides our military with the 
real budget growth necessary to keep 
pace with an adversary like China. It 
makes critical investments in readi-
ness and in modernization, as well as in 
research and development programs 
that help America keep our techno-
logical edge. 
It also includes a number of specific 
investments that would strengthen our 
force posture in the Indo-Pacific the-
ater. 
Most importantly, the bill authorizes 
an additional $230 million to begin im-
proving missile defense capabilities on 
Guam. Guam is a key element of our 
regional presence, but it has been in-
creasingly threatened by China’s grow-
ing arsenal. INDOPACOM commanders 
have warned of this threat since 2019, 
and the situation has only grown direr 
since then. 
The resources authorized by this bill 
would begin to address this threat, and 
by improving our defensive capabilities 
in the region, we can keep conflict 
from beginning in the first place. 
Like many of my colleagues, I am at 
a loss to explain why the Democratic 
leader hasn’t brought the NDAA to the 
floor. Even if we voted on it today, this 
would still be one of the latest NDAA 
votes in history. 
So as we celebrate Veterans Day next 
week and consider the sacrifice and 
service of America’s bravest, we should 
all remember our responsibility as 
Members of Congress, to give our mili-
tary men and women the resources 
they need to successfully complete the 
missions that they are given. We can-
not afford to delay any longer. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, ev-
erything we are doing to lead our coun-
try to build back better from this pan-
demic is about putting workers at the 
center of our economy. It is about rais-
ing wages and bringing down costs. 
We know what has happened in this 
country in the last decade. We have 
seen profits go up. We have seen the 
stock market go skyward. We have 
seen executive compensation explode 
upward. Yet wages in Nevada and Ohio 
and all over this country have essen-
tially been flat. That is why this Build 
Back Better plan is about raising 
wages and bringing down costs. 
We know what is wrong with our 
country. I said 20 years. It has been 30 
years, 40 years where productivity has 
gone up. Workers are earning more and 
more for their companies and for their 
bosses, but they simply aren’t sharing 
in the wealth that they have created. 
They have simply seen their wages flat. 
It has gotten more and more expen-
sive for families to raise a family and 
build a middle-class life. Healthcare, 
childcare, prescription drugs, higher 
education, housing are things the Pre-
siding Officer and I have worked on in 
the Banking and Housing Committee. 
Costs have doubled, tripled, quad-
rupled since people my age were trying 
to go to school and start a family. 
Meanwhile, people’s hard work isn’t 
paying off. 
I remember in our Banking Com-
mittee, we did a hearing. It was more 
of a listening session. It was one where 
Senators were not asking questions. It 
was listening to people, which we 
should probably do more often. It was 
called the ‘‘Dignity of Work’’ session. 
One woman was from southern West 
Virginia, who struggled her whole life 
and, clearly, was working hard. She 
said the words ‘‘working’’ and ‘‘poor’’ 
should not be in the same sentence. 
Think about that. She has worked all 
her life. She is making $13—she didn’t 
go to Harvard. She didn’t go to Ohio 
State. She worked all her life. She 
worked to raise kids. She is still mak-
ing $12, $13, $14 an hour—and that, 
Madam President, as costs only ever 
seem to go up. Even middle-class fami-
lies don’t feel stable. That was before 
the pandemic. 
We know that in this country, before 
the pandemic, a quarter of people paid 
more than half their income—more 
than half their income—in housing, in 
rent. That means if one thing happens 
in their lives—their car breaks down; 
their child gets sick, has to stay home 
from school; they maybe have a minor 
workplace injury and miss a week of 
work—everything can go wrong. Their 
lives can turn upside down because 
they can be evicted. 
Then what happens? 
We know this pandemic has upended 
the global economy. Supply chains are 
struggling. People feel their budget 
squeezed. 
They 
are 
anxious 
about 
whether prices that have gone up will 
ever go back down. 
We heard a lot of politicians, particu-
larly in this body, try to stoke fami-
lies’ anxiety for their own political 
gain, but they don’t offer solutions. 
Their only answer is: Let’s take power 
away from workers. 
They think the only way to keep 
prices low is to keep wages even lower. 
That is a false choice. 
We work on real solutions to bring 
down the biggest cost Americans face 
for the long term and to help families 
keep up with the cost of living. 
Housing, childcare, healthcare—those 
are three of the biggest items in any 
family’s budget. Build Back Better 
tackles all of them. 
On the Banking and Housing Com-
mittee, everything we are doing is 
about making housing more affordable, 
whether you pay a mortgage or wheth-
er you pay rent. Housing is just way 
too expensive and not available to 
enough people, plain and simple. We 
need to build more homes people can 
afford. We need to make the houses and 
the townhouses and the apartments we 
already have more affordable, and we 
need to make it affordable to buy a 
home. 
I visit communities in Ohio all the 
time with houses that look affordable. 
They are listed, maybe, at even $50,000 
or $75,000, but families can’t come up 
with a down payment or sometimes 
they can’t find lenders to make the 
loans. Sometimes we see these lower 
cost properties snapped up by private 
equity—by investors paying cash. We 
are working to fix that with plans like 
targeted down payment assistance, ex-
panding access to lower cost mort-
gages. 
Look at healthcare for a moment.

November 4, 2021 
prescription drug prices still eat away 
at people’s budgets. In the American 
Rescue Plan, we strengthen the Afford-
able Care Act to make ACA insurance 
plans more affordable. Customers are 
saving an average of 40 percent on their 
monthly premiums on ACA plans be-
cause of the American Rescue Plan we 
passed in March. We will make sure 
those cost savings continue so Ameri-
cans can save on their coverage. 
We will make it more affordable for 
seniors and Americans with disabilities 
to get the care they need at home from 
a workforce that actually makes a liv-
ing wage. 
I was with a number of home care 
workers in Cleveland the other day. 
These are people who take care of peo-
ple we love. They take care of aging 
parents; they take care of workers in-
jured on the job; they take care of fam-
ilies. They make $11, $12, $13 an hour. 
Some of them have been doing this for 
20 years, and they still don’t make a 
living wage. 
As I said earlier, as the lady from 
West Virginia said, the words ‘‘work-
ing’’ and ‘‘poor’’ should not be in the 
same sentence. 
We know how powerful the Big 
Pharma lobbyists are. For years—dec-
ades—many of us have fought to allow 
Medicare to negotiate prices with drug 
companies, just like private insurance 
companies and the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration do. 
I used to, as a Member of Congress, 
take 
busloads 
to 
Canada—about 
3 
hours away—so that seniors could buy 
prescription drugs in Windsor, Ontario, 
because it cost half as much. It was the 
same brand name, same dosage, same 
packaging, but the Canadian Govern-
ment negotiates prices directly with 
the drug companies. The American 
Government doesn’t. 
Why? 
Well, you know why. Look down the 
hall at MITCH MCCONNELL’s office, who 
has been the Republican leader of the 
Senate for many years. Look at the 
lobbyists from the drug companies who 
line up outside his office. He is always 
telling people: No, we are going to do 
whatever the drug companies want. We 
know that the entire minority, the en-
tire Republican Party here, is in the 
pockets of the drug companies. We 
know that. 
The problem is we have got to get all 
50 Democrats to stand up and say: No. 
We are going to negotiate. We are 
going to stand with Medicare bene-
ficiaries. We are going to stand with 
people who need prescription drugs—of 
all ages—and we are going to negotiate 
on their behalf directly with the drug 
companies, cutting the price. 
We do that with the VA. Whether it 
is in Reno or in Cleveland, whether it 
is in Las Vegas or in Columbus, the VA 
pays significantly less for prescription 
drugs than do the rest of us. 
In this bill, we are finally standing 
up to the drug companies. We are going 
to start bringing down seniors’ pre-
scription costs. For the first time ever, 
we are empowering Medicaid to nego-
tiate directly. It is going to make a dif-
ference for seniors—a huge difference 
for seniors—who are living on fixed in-
comes. 
Of course, we know, for young fami-
lies, they face, generally, different 
costs. The children of working parents 
often 
get 
their 
health 
insurance 
through Medicaid or through CHIP. 
Right now, if a mom takes on an extra 
shift, or if a dad takes a bonus for a job 
well 
done, 
that 
tiny 
change—that 
small change in their monthly in-
come—could cause their kids to lose 
their insurance for the month. 
What kind of policy is that? 
So Dad works really hard and is real-
ly good at his job, so he gets a raise; 
and Mom wants to work an extra shift, 
so she brings a little more money 
home. 
And then we take the benefit away? 
So we are saying to them: Yes, we be-
lieve in working hard, and we believe 
in family values, but if you work too 
hard and you make too much money, 
we are going to take away the benefit. 
That kind of policy is just stupid. 
That is why we are including my legis-
lation that will keep kids insured all 
year. It means parents won’t have to 
worry they will get hit with a huge 
medical bill if their child gets sick in 
the same month they work some extra 
hours. 
Of course, the biggest cost for so 
many families is childcare. The Build 
Back Better plan will ensure that mid-
dle-class families pay no more than 7 
percent of their income on childcare. 
What a relief that is going to be. 
Again, the point of this bill is job 
creation. Build Back Better is job cre-
ation; it is the biggest tax cut in Amer-
ican history for families with children; 
and it is to bring costs down. 
One of the most oppressive, most bur-
densome, most difficult costs for fami-
lies is childcare. For a family with one 
toddler and two parents who earn 
$50,000 a year, our plan will save them 
$5,000—$5,000—in childcare costs. Some 
families will save up to $6,500. 
Think of what that means. On top of 
this, as I said, is the biggest tax cut for 
working families in American history. 
In my State and in Nevada—the Pre-
siding Officer’s State that Senator 
CORTEZ
MASTO
represents—it is not 
much different from the rest of the 
country. 
More than 90 percent of the families 
in Ohio who have children under 18 
will, at a minimum, get a $3,000 tax 
cut—at a minimum, $3,000 a year. That 
is a real tax cut. That is not like a de-
duction. Those are real dollars in their 
pockets. Think about that: more than 
90 percent of families in this country. 
In my State, it is families with 2.2 
million children. That many kids, that 
many families, will get at least a $3,000 
tax cut. If they have three children, 
they will get an $8,000 or a $9,000 tax 
cut in the course of a year, and that is 
one of the most important parts of this 
bill. It will help them keep up with the 
costs of diapers and childcare and 
clothes and all of the other expenses. 
One of the joys of this job is going 
online where we have a website. We 
have a ‘‘tell your story’’ about the big-
gest tax cut in American history for 
working families and what that means 
to you. 
One woman wrote in and said: For 
the first time in my life, I can send my 
son to summer camp for a week. 
A man wrote in from Cincinnati and 
said: For the first time ever, I can, fi-
nally, now afford fast-pitch softball 
equipment for my daughter. 
Others have said: You know, now I 
can put aside $100 a month for my child 
to go to Eastern Gateway or to Stark 
State or to North Central Ohio’s tech-
nical or community college. 
Others have said—and this is the one 
we hear the most. You have heard so 
many families talk about the last week 
of the month. For the people around 
here who make more money than this, 
you don’t think of it much; but in the 
last week of the month, so many fami-
lies face the anxiety of: How do I put 
together enough money to pay my rent 
this month? 
Well, the child tax credit has relieved 
that anxiety for millions of families 
because they get that $300 or that $250 
or, maybe, with two children, they get 
$600 on the 15th of the month that can 
ease the making of their rent that 
time. 
But it comes down to: Whose side are 
you on? 
It comes down to MITCH MCCONNELL 
and the lobbyists in his office and the 
politicians who always do his bidding 
and pass their tax cuts for the wealthy 
and the corporations that outsource 
jobs, and you know that. It was 4 years 
ago that there was the biggest tax cut, 
and 70 percent of that tax cut went to 
the wealthiest 1 percent of people. Con-
trast that with our tax cut whereby 90 
percent of Ohio families will get at 
least a $3,000-a-year tax cut. 
It is pretty simple. If you want tax 
cuts for billionaires, then vote against 
this bill. If you want tax cuts for work-
ing families, that is why you will sup-
port Build Back Better. 
Do you want tax cuts for drug compa-
nies, or do you want to bring down pre-
scription drug prices? Do you want tax 
cuts for big banks that won’t give your 
family a mortgage, or do you want to 
bring down the cost of housing? 
When you love this country, you 
fight for the people who make it work. 
You fight for their jobs. You fight for 
their higher wages. You fight to bring 
down their cost of living. That is what 
we are doing. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Ohio.

ator from Ohio.

Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I

is very concerning and has to do with 
our national security and our home-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7782 
November 4, 2021 
I am the ranking Republican on the 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee, and in my role on 
that committee, we have done a lot of 
investigation into what happened in 
Afghanistan in terms of the rushed and 
chaotic evacuation. 
Unfortunately, I am here today to 
talk about a new threat to our home-
land security due to the Biden adminis-
tration’s failure to adequately vet the 
Afghan evacuees who came through 
this chaotic process. 
Like many of my colleagues here on 
the floor—I think I can speak for 
them—I support the resettlement of 
those who stood with us and our allies 
who stood with us in battle, in par-
ticular, over the past two decades in 
Afghanistan. That is important. Yet 
everybody recognizes that the rushed 
nature of the evacuation resulted in 
some of the wrong people coming out 
and many of the right people not being 
rescued from Afghanistan. 
Too many people were left behind. 
There is no question about that. There 
were American citizens left behind and 
permanent residents left behind, and 
many of the Afghans who had worked 
with us and with our allies as inter-
preters, as drivers, who worked at 
NATO, or who worked at the United 
Nations were left behind—so were a lot 
of people who were actually in the 
process of getting what is called a spe-
cial immigrant visa, an SIV. Those 
would be our allies in Afghanistan, the 
Afghans who, again, stood with us as 
drivers or interpreters and so on. 
Getting information has been really 
hard from the administration, and it is 
very frustrating to me, also to every 
one of my colleagues, and to the Amer-
ican people. In fact, in the recent con-
tinuing resolution, we actually got lan-
guage included that requires, by No-
vember 30, for the administration to 
tell us exactly how many SIV holders— 
special immigrant visa holders—were 
left behind, how many citizens were 
left behind, and how many people, who 
were employees of a U.S.- or a U.N.- 
funded partner organization, were left 
behind. We still haven’t heard, so we 
don’t know the information. 
What we do know is that very few of 
the evacuees who came out were either 
American citizens, permanent resi-
dents, SIV applicants, or, certainly, 
SIV holders. In fact, we know from the 
Defense Department that there were 
only about 700 holders of SIVs who 
came out of the, roughly, 78,000 people 
who were evacuated to the United 
States. 
Let me say that again. Only about 
700 of those people were SIV holders. 
That is out of thousands of SIV holders 
and applicants who were left behind in 
Afghanistan. There were 78,000 people 
who got out, but the vast majority of 
them—again, I am not represented by 
any of these groups that we would have 
thought would have been brought out. 
It is also clear that, in the rush and 
chaos at the Karzai Airport, the major-
ity of those who were evacuated were 
neither American citizens, green card 
holders, Afghans, nor special immi-
grant visa holders, as we talked about. 
So, just as we have an obligation to 
help resettle those who stood with us, 
we also have an obligation to ensure 
that our communities are safe and that 
we know who is being released into our 
communities. This means not releasing 
people who have not been fully vetted. 
We want to know who these people are. 
They might possibly have records— 
criminal records. They might have ter-
rorist affiliations. That is why you 
need to do the proper screening and 
vetting. 
Secretary Mayorkas testified in Sep-
tember before the Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Committee, 
where, again, I serve as the top Repub-
lican. The testimony was about the 
vetting procedures of the Afghan evac-
uees. 
He said: ‘‘There is a robust screening 
and vetting process in addition to ex-
pertise both in the transit countries 
and here domestically.’’ 
‘‘There is a robust screening and vet-
ting process both in the transit coun-
tries and here domestically.’’ I wish 
that were true, but, unfortunately, it is 
not. 
An unclassified briefing last week 
with Federal officials from all of the 
relevant national security Agencies 
confirmed what our committee staff 
had already discovered through our in- 
person oversight of the vetting oper-
ations. They toured operations here in 
the States. They also toured operations 
overseas at what are called the lily 
pads, where people are brought from 
Afghanistan to a foreign destination 
and then brought to the United States. 
What they found and what was con-
firmed at that meeting last week is 
that there is not a robust screening and 
vetting process for all Afghan evac-
uees. It is true that there is a screening 
process. This is what it consists of: pro-
viding fingerprints and your name and, 
many times, a facial image—so your 
face, 
your 
fingerprints, 
and 
your 
name—to a Federal database at the 
overseas lily pads. But unless the evac-
uee was a known terrorist, a terrorist 
affiliate, or a criminal whose name, 
face, or fingerprints were stored on the 
system, there was no vetting; there 
were no interviews—nothing else—for 
Afghans who have been paroled into 
the United States. 
Now, here is the problem with that: 
Our database is not complete. Despite 
repeated attempts to obtain the infor-
mation, by the way, we don’t know how 
many Afghans were successful in get-
ting past the database screening I just 
talked about, but we are told by those 
on the ground that it was the vast ma-
jority. 
In other words, very few people were 
picked up through this database we 
talked about, which is DHS, the State 
Department, and intelligence services. 
Relying on hits on this database—this 
biographic and biometric database that 
we have—is not adequate because the 
databases do not have information on 
all Afghans. Certainly, they don’t have 
information on all Afghans who may be 
terrorists or who may be terrorist sym-
pathizers or who may have criminal 
records. We didn’t have a database like 
that, so we are pinging it against a 
database that was incomplete. 
Those Afghans with no information 
in the systems at all are not a known 
risk—I acknowledge that; and most of 
them are good people—but this does 
not mean that admitting them with no 
additional scrutiny is an acceptable 
risk. 
The best way to know something 
more about someone who is in the 
process of being paroled into the 
United States is through intensive in- 
person interviews. That is how it is 
traditionally done. 
Interviews allow Federal officials to 
dig deeper into an evacuee’s back-
ground and learn more about their af-
filiations, as well as their beliefs about 
the United States and the Western 
world. 
In fact, we learned in the 9/11 Com-
mission 
report 
effective 
in-person 
interviews by U.S. government officials 
prevented at least three individuals 
who were intending to join the 2001 ter-
ror plot and attacks—it kept them 
from entering the country and contrib-
uting to that tragedy on September 11. 
One of the major lessons from the 9/ 
11 Commission was that if the U.S. 
Government had conducted face-to-face 
interviews of all 19 of the 9/11 hijack-
ers, the attacks may have been pre-
vented altogether. 
How soon we forget. 
The requirement of an in-person 
interview is a standard process that 
normally applies to all refugees. It 
would have been appropriate to con-
sider most of these Afghans to be refu-
gees, who would have been subject to 
persecution from the Taliban due to 
their status as a person who worked 
with us or because they were part of a 
vulnerable group, including a lot of 
women and girls. 
Interestingly, the Biden administra-
tion wants to treat the Afghan evac-
uees as refugees when it comes to their 
benefits, but they are not following the 
necessary refugee security procedures 
to vet those individuals. 
Our oversight identified many other 
issues and concerns with the vetting 
process. For example, if an Afghan did 
have identification, such as an Afghan 
national ID card or passport, the 
screening process did not include vali-
dation of the documents beyond a vis-
ual inspection; no follow-up. 
The officials working at the military 
bases in Europe said they did not have 
any specific training or expertise in 
identifying a fraudulent Afghan ID 
card. 
So, again, our folks went over to 
these foreign locations, these so-called 
lily pads, talked to the people who 
were doing this screening process, and 
said: When you get an Afghan ID card, 
what do you do?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7783 
November 4, 2021 
They said: We don’t have the exper-
tise to identify a fraudulent Afghan ID 
card, so we assume that it is accurate, 
and their identities are logged into a 
national security database, a U.S. na-
tional security base—database, in some 
cases, of course, then, based on what 
could be a fake ID. 
If the evacuees did not have any iden-
tification documents, which apparently 
was the case with a substantial num-
ber, no ID at all, Federal officials sim-
ply logged them into our databases 
based on what they said was their 
name and their date of birth. So they 
created a national security database 
from what these individuals volun-
teered. 
We are told it is not unusual for Af-
ghans not to know their actual birth 
date. It is just not always part of the 
culture to record or have that informa-
tion. That is understood. But this has 
resulted in a number of the databases, 
including 
information 
about 
birth 
dates, being January 1 of a particular 
year. So there are some people logged 
in to say January 1, 1990. 
The problem here is that our systems 
rely heavily on an individual’s birth-
day as a key biographic identifier. 
You get asked your birthday all the 
time, I am sure, whether it is getting 
healthcare, whether it is at a security 
checkpoint. 
And now we have entered informa-
tion into our systems that we cannot 
rely on to be accurate; in some cases, 
could be false identities. 
Based on our oversight—again, trips 
to these sites with Democratic staff 
members, Republican staff members— 
talking with those coordinating the Af-
ghan resettlement here in the United 
States, it appears that each side of the 
ocean—folks overseas and folks here in 
America—thought the other side was 
doing more vetting than was actually 
occurring. 
The official overseeing the screening 
of an evacuee at a lily pad overseas 
told us he thought the vetting was 
being done when evacuees arrived on 
U.S. soil. When asked if he felt the 
screening and vetting being done at the 
military bases in Europe were suffi-
cient to be confident in America’s se-
curity—since evacuees can and have 
left the bases in the United States—he 
said they were not. 
But that is exactly what is hap-
pening. 
A senior official at a base in the 
United States confirmed that there are 
no in-person vetting interviews at any 
of the seven domestic military bases 
that are now housing evacuees, and 
that all vetting interviews were done 
overseas at the lily pads. So it is a lit-
tle bit of one pointing to the other. 
Officials also confirmed that when an 
evacuee arrived in the United States, 
the only screening that was conducted 
was the standard Customs screening 
that all international visitors and 
tourists go through at the airport. 
Specifically, evacuees provided their 
information, if they had it, at the Cus-
toms booth, and if there were no flags, 
they were immediately paroled into 
the United States for 2 years. Customs 
would check their information against 
the records created at the lily pads, ef-
fectively creating a feedback loop. So 
information that might not be accu-
rate or might not be fulsome, might 
not be appropriate is then added to 
other information and one checked 
against the other. 
Once here, the Afghan evacuees are 
not detained. According to the admin-
istration, more than 2,000 of these indi-
viduals have now left the military 
bases where they are being housed and 
are freely moving about our commu-
nities. 
Again, my view is most of these peo-
ple are good people. Some of them did 
help us. As I said, it is a relatively 
small number. Somewhere around 75 
percent are not SIV holders or appli-
cants or citizens or permanent resi-
dents. But we don’t know who a lot of 
these folks are. And, again, people 
think that they are at the military 
bases because that is where they have 
to be until we do fuller, further vet-
ting. That is not true. There are no 
interviews being done here, and they 
are free to walk off the military bases, 
and a couple thousand have. 
The only conditions of parole that 
must be met prior to leaving the mili-
tary base is to receive vaccinations for 
measles and COVID–19, and agreeing to 
update DHS with any change of address 
within 10 days. That is it. 
I led an amendment with some of my 
colleagues to the recent continuing 
resolution to ensure that not all of the 
Afghan evacuees are automatically eli-
gible for what is called a REAL ID. 
If you have been to an airport re-
cently, you know you are going to need 
a REAL ID to get on a plane. A REAL 
ID is supposed to be issued only to indi-
viduals with a valid Social Security 
Number; proof of identity, which is 
shown through a birth certificate; and 
two proofs of residency, like a bank 
statement, lease, or utility bill, that 
show that you permanently live in the 
United States. There is a process to get 
a REAL ID. 
It 
was 
a 
9/11 
Commission 
rec-
ommendation, by the way, that we 
have a REAL ID procedure. 
But while we U.S. citizens have to 
abide by all these requirements to get 
a license or an ID, Congress waived one 
requirement for Afghan evacuees: the 
requirement to provide proof of lawful 
residence. 
This undermines the REAL ID sys-
tem, and it should not happen. 
The amendment I offered with col-
leagues would have required the Af-
ghan evacuees to follow the normal 
process to require a REAL ID. It would 
be to apply for asylum and then receive 
a REAL ID. Until their asylum applica-
tion is approved, they would be able to 
fly on an airplane with that asylum ap-
plication or their work authorization, 
which many of them have received. 
Unfortunately, this body rejected 
that amendment with a narrow vote. 
Due to the reckless policies of the 
Biden administration, we have the sit-
uation where an Afghan evacuee with 
no presence in our databases, no docu-
ments establishing identity, can have a 
cover identity created by the U.S. Gov-
ernment at, for example, Ramstein Air 
Base, where we went and talked to in-
dividuals, based on a stated name, vol-
unteered, a stated birth date, and then 
can receive a REAL ID when they come 
to the United States. 
Doesn’t seem right to people when I 
explain that, and it is not, but that is 
the system. 
I have come down here a number of 
times to talk about what is going on on 
the southern border. Again, in my role 
as the ranking Republican on the 
Homeland Security Committee, we do 
a lot of work in that area. 
Unfortunately, it is getting worse, 
not better, in terms of number of peo-
ple coming across, the number of drugs 
coming across, and the amount of 
human trafficking. 
What is astounding is that, as open 
as our southern border is under this ad-
ministration, if an Afghan tried to 
cross our southern border, they would 
be interviewed by a Federal law en-
forcement official. 
Under this Afghan resettlement oper-
ation, though, the Biden administra-
tion has lowered the bar for security 
even below that of our southern border. 
We already know from the adminis-
tration there are Afghan evacuees who 
pose 
dangerous 
national 
security 
threats, who were able to pass the 
screening process we talked about at 
the lily pads overseas and to arrive on 
U.S. soil. 
We still don’t know how they were 
apprehended, but we do know from 
media reporting that there are at least 
10 evacuees who have made it past all 
this screening into the United States 
prior to the national security concerns 
being raised, and causing them cur-
rently to be detained in Federal facili-
ties as a national security threat. That 
is 10. We don’t know how many more 
there are. 
The lack of appropriate screening 
and vetting of Afghan evacuees by this 
administration is reminiscent of a pre- 
9/11 security mindset. 
Remember, we were at war in Af-
ghanistan for 20 years. We know that 
ISIS-K and al-Qaida are operating in 
Afghanistan. These dynamics in Af-
ghanistan should be reflected by ensur-
ing that normal national security vet-
ting processes are applied to all evac-
uees. I don’t think that is too much to 
ask. 
I stand ready to work with the ad-
ministration and all of my colleagues 
in the Senate, both sides of the aisle, 
to address and mitigate this vulnera-
bility to U.S. homeland security. I 
hope it is not too late. 
I believe we have got to address the 
REAL ID eligibility of Afghan evacuees 
and require in-person vetting prior to 
distributing any new REAL IDs to 
those 
Afghan 
refugees 
who

reached our shores. For future Afghan 
arrivals, it is clear that the vetting and 
interview process must be strengthened 
and enforced. And, again, in talking to 
the Federal officials on the ground 
overseas, they would agree. 
It is not too much to ask that Afghan 
refugees be treated the same as all ref-
ugees when it comes to security vet-
ting. We can’t continue to allow a lack 
of effective screening of Afghan evac-
uees to endanger our communities. 
I yield the floor.

CONFIRMATION OF ADRIENNE 
WOJCIECHOWSKI 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am 
pleased that yesterday, the Senate con-
firmed Adrienne Wojciechowski to be 
the Assistant Secretary for Congres-
sional Relations at the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture—USDA—a role for 
which is eminently qualified. For more 
than a decade, Adrienne has been an in-
dispensable staff member in the Sen-
ate, dedicated to supporting farmers, 
growing our rural economies, and tack-
ling climate change and land steward-
ship challenges. Adrienne has earned 
deep respect from on both sides of the 
aisle. 
Adrienne first joined my staff in 2007 
and quickly became a key member of 
my legislative team on topics ranging 
from agriculture to water quality to 
climate change. Adrienne was imme-
diately involved in 2008 farm bill nego-
tiations and played an integral staff 
role in negotiating substantial portions 
of the 2014 and 2018 farm bills. 
Over the years, I could always count 
on Adrienne’s persistence, attention to 
detail, and sound judgement. Adrienne 
brought these same gifts to her work 
with USDA partners in Vermont, care-
fully building trusting relationships 
that enabled my legislative work to be 
informed by on-the-ground, State-level 
delivery of USDA programs. 
Most recently, Adrienne has served 
as a professional staff member on the 
Senate 
Agriculture 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee, managing Senators’ di-
verse spending priorities in the annual 
appropriations cycle and negotiating 
bipartisan final bills. 
I have served on the Senate Agri-
culture Committee since I first came 
to the Senate. There is an old saying 
that Vermont without farms would 
still be a nice place, but it wouldn’t be 
Vermont. While she is not a native 
Vermonter herself, it has been a pleas-
ure to see Adrienne form such deep re-
lationships with Vermont’s agrarian 
traditions, our farmers, and our land-
scape. 
Whether 
it 
was 
navigating 
USDA bureaucracy or rebuilding a barn 
after a fire, farmers and the agri-
culture community in Vermont knew 
that a call to my office would get Adri-
enne on the case. 
Although Senate staff work behind 
the scenes and their contributions can 
go 
unheralded, 
the 
impact 
of 
Adrienne’s dedication, her contribu-
tions to conservation policy, farm via-
bility, and farmland protection pro-
grams can truly be seen on the land-
scape of Vermont and across the coun-
try. On behalf of all Vermonters, I 
thank Adrienne Wojciechowski for her 
service to the U.S. Senate and wish her 
the best of luck as she joins the Biden 
administration. 
f 
REMEMBERING NEAL SMITH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
would like to expand on my tribute to 
former Iowa Congressman Neal Smith. 
As I said yesterday, he was a true 
public servant, interested in doing 
right by his State rather than seeking 
self-aggrandizement. He was a real leg-
islator, not a would-be pundit seeking 
the spotlight. These are attributes that 
make him a role model, and I feel 
lucky to have been mentored by him. 
When I was elected, I was the only Re-
publican in the Iowa delegation. He 
didn’t care that I was of a different 
party. He knew we both had our polit-
ical views, but we were both there to 
represent the state we love. I will never 
forget his kindness in taking me under 
wing. 
Neal Smith is a legend in Iowa, as 
evidenced by the fact that his name is 
attached to several Iowa institutions, 
including the Neal Smith Wildlife Ref-
uge, which he was instrumental in es-
tablishing, the Neal Smith Trail, the 
Neal Smith Federal Building in Des 
Moines, which I helped to name after 
him with Senator Harkin, and the Neal 
and Bea Smith Law Center at their 
alma mater, Drake University. 
His legislative legacy includes a long 
stint as a senior member of the Appro-
priations Committee. 
Neal Smith was instrumental in cre-
ating 
Lake 
Red 
Rock, 
Saylorville 
Lake, and Lake Rathbun, which help 
protect Iowans from flooding, serve as 
reservoirs, and provide recreational op-
portunities for Iowans. 
He also authored legislation to help 
small businesses after a disaster and 
legislation helping small businesses 
with federal government contracts. 
Perhaps his most prominent legisla-
tive accomplishment was passing legis-
lation combatting nepotism in the Fed-
eral Government. 
Neal Smith served in World War II as 
a bomber pilot, was shot down, and re-
ceived a Purple Heart, as well as other 
medals.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7785 
November 4, 2021 
He and his wife Bea attended Drake 
University Law School together. When 
they graduated, she was offered less 
than him for the same job with the 
same firm despite her having had bet-
ter grades, so he turned down the job 
and opened a practice with her. 
He soon entered public service lo-
cally, serving as assistant Polk County 
attorney and as chairman of the Polk 
County Welfare Board. 
In 1958, Neal Smith was elected to 
the House of Representatives, where he 
served for 36 years, longer than any 
other Iowan has served in the U.S. 
House. 
Even though he represented Iowa’s 
largest metropolitan area, he came 
from a farm background like me and 
continued to farm near Altoona during 
his time in office. 
I remember him as a strong defender 
of agriculture. 
I value the friendship I had with Neal 
Smith starting as a freshmen Congress-
man and continuing through his time 
after leaving Congress. 
Again, I pay tribute to this humble 
public servant. Barbara and I will con-
tinue to remember his family in our 
prayers.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DOROTHY JACKSON 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring an 
Ohio trailblazer who we lost last 
month, the first woman to serve as 
deputy mayor for the city of Akron, 
Dorothy Ola Jackson. 
Former Akron mayor Tom Sayer, 
who nominated her to become deputy 
mayor, called her an ‘‘urbanist saint.’’ 
And she was. Born in Akron, OH, in 
1933, Dorothy Ola Jackson’s life of 
service was molded by the loss of her 
brother and parents before the age of 
24. She became a fierce advocate for 
families and for her community. 
For 12 years, she worked at Goodwill, 
starting as a secretary and rising to 
serve as assistant public relations di-
rector. She helped organize special 
projects and volunteer efforts. Knowing 
American Sign Language and as a per-
son of deep faith, she would sign a 
Bible reading to the company’s 30 deaf 
employees every morning. 
She went on to work as a human 
services administrator for Akron Met-
ropolitan Housing Authority for 16 
years, where she helped transform the 
agency. 
In 1984, Dorothy Ola Jackson became 
deputy mayor of intergovernmental re-
lations, where she continued advo-
cating for those who often had no other 
voice in the city. During her first year 
in office, she helped organize the city’s 
first day camp for disabled children. 
She said, ‘‘People who have never had 
a voice in government can now get a 
little closer.’’ 
Deputy Mayor Jackson has received 
many awards and accolades throughout 
her life, including the United Way Dis-
tinguished Service Award, the Bert A. 
Polsky 
Humanitarian 
Award, 
the 
Akron 
Urban 
League’s 
Community 
Service Award, and in 1984, she was 
named Woman of the Year by Akron 
Business and Professional Women-USA. 
But she often said the most meaning-
ful honor came when the Akron Metro-
politan Housing Authority named a 
property that houses disabled resi-
dents, the Dorothy O. Jackson Terrace 
Apartments in downtown Akron. 
Dorothy dedicated her life to serving 
and helping others and to making 
Akron a better place for all its resi-
dents. The legacy of Deputy Mayor 
Jackson will live on through her far- 
reaching work and through the many 
lives she touched.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. KRISTINA M. 
JOHNSON 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask my 
Senate colleagues to join me in hon-
oring Dr. Kristina M. Johnson and cele-
brating her investiture as the 16th 
president of The Ohio State University. 
As an alum of the university and long-
time friend of the Ohio State commu-
nity, I know the investiture of a presi-
dent is a significant milestone in the 
life of this land-grant university. 
Since The Ohio State University was 
founded in 1870, the institution has 
been guided by 16 presidents, each of 
whom has left a lasting mark on the 
history of the university. Since taking 
office as president on August 24, 2020, 
Dr. Johnson has already begun to make 
an impact at Ohio State. She has 
worked to be an inclusive leader and 
advance the university’s mission to up-
lift lives through academic and re-
search excellence. 
Dr. Johnson has close family ties to 
Ohio State and Ohio. Her grandfather 
graduated from Ohio State in 1896, 
played right guard on one of the early 
football teams, and was a member of 
the Tesla Club. Dr. Johnson brings a 
wealth of experience to this role, hav-
ing served in numerous leadership roles 
at prestigious institutions for higher 
education, most recently as chancellor 
of the State University of New York. 
And she has been a public servant, 
serving as Under Secretary of Energy 
at the U.S. Department of Energy. Dr. 
Johnson 
is 
married 
to 
Veronica 
Meinhard, and it has been a pleasure to 
get to know them and discuss the work 
we can do together to support Ohio stu-
dents. 
With Dr. Johnson’s more than 30 
years of experience and leadership, the 
future of Ohio State is indeed bright. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing and celebrating this momentous 
occasion for this university, which is 
so important to the central Ohio com-
munity and to our State. Connie and I 
wish Dr. Johnson, Veronica, and the 
entire Buckeye Community well as 
they embark on this journey together.∑ 
REMEMBERING LYNN AAS 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, on Oc-
tober 28, North Dakota lost one of our 
heroes. Lynn Aas of Minot, age 100, was 
to many of us the face of the very best 
of the Greatest Generation. This child 
of the Great Depression was raised on a 
farm near Benedict, ND, and was 
among the 60,000 North Dakotans who 
served in the U.S. Armed Forces during 
World War II. 
He enlisted in the U.S. Army in Au-
gust 1942, after completing his first 
year of college. He became part of the 
193rd Glider Infantry Regiment of the 
17th Airborne Division and, after ex-
tensive training, was shipped to Liver-
pool, England, 2 years later. 
Lynn’s first combat experience was 
the Battle of the Bulge, one of the cost-
liest battles in American history with 
more than 80,000 U.S. casualties, in-
cluding 19,000 American soldiers killed. 
His division and unit were flown to 
France and transported by trucks to 
Bastogne on December 24, 1944. His pla-
toon entered combat on January 7, 
fighting in deep snow, frigid cold, and 
heavy fog. Beginning with 55 troopers, 
Lynn was one of only five survivors to 
leave the front lines 3 weeks later. The 
end of January brought his first 2 
nights of sleep under a roof in 5 weeks. 
In February, his platoon fought along 
the Seigfried Line on Nazi Germany’s 
border. 
Later in March 1945, he participated 
in Operation Varsity, the last large- 
scale Allied airborne operation of the 
war. There he was towed in a glider and 
landed behind enemy lines near Wesel, 
Germany. Lynn’s combat career ended 
on March 25 when he was wounded in 
his left arm by shrapnel. Following ex-
tensive recuperation back in America, 
Lynn remained in the Army another 5 
months before being honorably dis-
charged on November 1, 1945. 
For his valor and commendable 18 
months of service during World War II, 
he was awarded the Purple Heart and 
Bronze Star medals, in addition to the 
Glider Badge, Combat Infantryman’s 
Badge, Good Conduct Medal, American 
Campaign 
Medal, 
European-African- 
Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 
one 
Bronze 
Arrowhead 
and 
three 
Bronze Campaign Stars, and the World 
War II Victory Medal. 
After his discharge, Lynn earned 
business and law degrees from the Uni-
versity of North Dakota, and moved to 
Minot in 1960, where he and his wife 
Beverly raised four sons. He managed a 
medical clinic until retirement, served 
in the North Dakota Legislature for 8 
years and was a delegate to the State’s 
1972 Constitutional Convention. Until 
his final days, Lynn remained active in 
the Minot community. 
He shared his World War II story 
throughout his life, giving a voice to 
all veterans whose lives were forever 
impacted because of their selfless serv-
ice. Lynn attended reunions of the 17th 
Airborne Division, and in 1999, he vis-
ited Europe with other 17th Airborne 
Division veterans, visiting the loca-
tions where they had fought more than

a half century earlier. In 2015, he vis-
ited Belgium again to commemorate 
the 70th anniversary of the Battle of 
the Bulge. As one of the official rep-
resentatives from the United States to 
this observance, Lynn was greeted by 
many grateful Belgians who had not 
forgotten what American soldiers did 
to liberate them from Hitler’s tyranny. 
In 
2017, 
the 
French 
Government 
awarded Lynn its highest honor, the 
Knight of the Legion of Honor medal, 
an award created by Napoleon in 1802. 
The letter from the French Govern-
ment notifying Lynn of this award car-
ried these poignant words, ‘‘73 years 
ago you gave your youth to France and 
the French People. Many of your fellow 
soldiers did not return, but they re-
main in our hearts . . . You saved us. 
We will never forget. For us, the 
French people, you are a hero. Grati-
tude and remembrance are forever in 
our souls.’’ 
As he is buried today, we remember 
the remarkable life of Lynn Aas. He is 
one of those personalities who, even at 
the age of 100, you think is never going 
to die. Yet he has earned this oppor-
tunity to rest, and I join all North Da-
kotans in sending our sincere condo-
lences and prayers to his family. I am 
grateful that I could count Lynn Aas as 
a friend and one of my mentors in pub-
lic service and public life. He will be 
greatly missed. God bless his memory.∑

RECOGNIZING DAY AND DAY FEED 
MILL 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Day and Day Feed Mill, a fam-
ily-owned small business in Columbia, 
KY, as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. 
In 1954, Garland Day established Day 
and Day Feed Mill in Columbia, KY. 
Garland decided to meet the need for a 
local feed mill providing dairy and beef 
cattle feeds and supplies. A family-run 
business from the start, Garland’s sons, 
Allen and Bobby, took over Day and 
Day Feed Mill in the early 1960s. Con-
tinuing the family legacy, Garland’s 
grandsons, Anthony and Gary Day, 
along with their cousin Ray Brock, 
stepped up to lead the business in the 
1990s. Together, they rebuilt and ex-
panded the business in 2009, building 
their new location on the same spot as 
the original Day and Day Feed Mill. 
Today, Day and Day Feed Mill con-
tinues to thrive as a farm supply store 
and feed retailer. The family-owned 
business celebrated its 67th anniver-
sary in 2021 and is led by the third and 
fourth generation of Days. The full- 
service farm and ranch supply store 
plays a critical role in Adair County, 
providing everything from agro-chemi-
cals and seeds to fishing and hunting 
supplies. Additionally, the store sup-
ports local Kentucky small businesses, 
selling hand-crafted goods and gifts. 
The Days’ strong sense of family has 
built a tight-knit, supportive team, 
with some families employed there for 
generations. 
Like many small businesses, the Day 
family has consistently invested in and 
served their community. They regu-
larly participate in local and regional 
events, ranging from agricultural fairs 
to hosting an annual customer appre-
ciation event. Day and Day Feed Mill’s 
outstanding service and high-quality 
products 
have 
consistently 
earned 
them recognition from industry groups 
and community members alike. They 
were recognized as Business of the Year 
by the Adair County Cattlemen’s Asso-
ciation in 2012 and Outstanding Agri-
culturist of the Year in 2018 by the Co-
lumbia-Adair County Chamber of Com-
merce. For several years, Day and Day 
Feed Mill has consistently earned the 
Adair County Community Voice Read-
ers’ Choice Award in several cat-
egories, including Best Agriculture 
Store, Best Sporting Goods/Hunting 
Store, and Best Customer Service. Over 
the past year, Day and Day Feed Mills 
adapted to the challenges caused by 
the coronavirus pandemic and contin-
ued supporting local farmers as they 
kept the country fed. 
Day and Day Feed Mill is a remark-
able example of the critical role that 
small, 
family-oriented 
agricultural 
businesses play in rural communities. 
Small businesses, like Day and Day 
Feed Mill, form the heart of towns 
across Kentucky and play a critical 
role in Kentucky’s agricultural indus-
try. Congratulations to Anthony, Gary, 
Ray, and the entire team at Day and 
Day Feed Mill. I wish them the best of 
luck and look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

RECOGNIZING REED FAMILY 
FLORAL 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Reed Family Floral of Virgie, 
KY, as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. 
In January 2020, Evan Sykes founded 
Reed Family Floral. Evan, who grew up 
in Pike County, was inspired by his 
family’s legacy of entrepreneurship. 
From 1981 to 2003, his great-aunt and 
great-grandmother owned and operated 
a flower shop called Reed Floral. After 
graduating from Shelby Valley High 
School and earning an AA from Big 
Sandy Community and Technical Col-
lege, Evan decided to honor that legacy 
and establish his own floral business. 
Starting with $500, he began making 
and selling wreaths. The business grew 
rapidly, enabling Evan to purchase a 
small building to house his operation. 
When Reed Family Floral expanded 
again, Evan had the perfect location in 
mind. In August 2021, Evan moved his 
business into the same building that 
had housed his family’s flower shop 
decades earlier. 
Today, Reed Family Floral has be-
come a local favorite. As the owner and 
sole full-time employee, Evan handles 
every aspect of the business, from ac-
counting and marketing, to floral de-
sign and delivery. He prepares flower 
arrangements for any occasion, includ-
ing weddings, school functions, and fu-
nerals. Evan’s floral arrangements are 
in 
demand 
year-round, 
especially 
around Valentine’s Day and Mother’s 
Day. Notably, Evan balanced his entre-
preneurship and education. While run-
ning a full-time business, he is pur-
suing a BA in accounting at Morehead 
State University. As a nonessential 
business, Reed Family Floral was im-
pacted by the COVID–19 pandemic-in-
duced lockdowns. Evan rose to the 
challenge, working with other small 
businesses 
to 
source 
supplies 
and 
adapting his contactless delivery op-
tions. 
Like many small business owners, 
Evan is active in his community. Lo-
cally, Reed Family Floral has spon-
sored the Pikeville High School tennis 
team and the Shelby Valley High 
School cheer team. They provide ar-
rangements for school events, and par-
ticipate in local fairs. From day one, 
Reed Family Floral has valued cus-
tomer service and high-quality prod-
ucts. Recently, they were recognized 
by local news outlet Mountaintop 
Media as one of the best flower shops in 
the area. 
Reed Family Floral is a remarkable 
example of the critical role small busi-
nesses play in every aspect of building 
community. 
Small 
businesses 
like 
Reed Family Floral form the heart of 
towns across Kentucky, regularly step-
ping up to support their communities. 
Congratulations to Evan and the entire 
team at Reed Family Floral. I wish 
them the best of luck and look forward 
to watching their continued growth 
and success in Kentucky.∑

TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN HOFER 
∑ Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I 
recognize my friend, Carolyn Hofer, as 
she enters retirement after more than 
50 years impacting the great State of 
South Dakota and many of its citizens. 
Carolyn has worked as an insurance 
agent, association program adminis-
trator, and most recently as the execu-
tive vice president of the Independent 
Insurance Agents of South Dakota, 
IIASD. In that capacity, she has rep-
resented hundreds of Main Street small 
businesses, their employees, and the 
communities that they serve. She has 
done a remarkable job of piloting the 
association as a strong and thoughtful 
leader. 
Carolyn grew up on a family dairy 
farm near Worthing, graduated from 
Lennox High School, and went on to

graduate from Nettleton Commercial 
College. She entered the insurance in-
dustry shortly thereafter and never 
looked back. Carolyn started with Un-
derwriter’s Adjusting Company before 
moving to Pierre and working for Dave 
Johnson Insurance. Following her time 
there, the IIASD opportunity presented 
itself, and Carolyn subsequently rose 
through the ranks to become the asso-
ciation’s top employee. 
Despite the many hours that Carolyn 
has spent serving her agent member-
ship and their customers, she will be 
the first to tell you that she has re-
ceived so much more than she has 
given over the years. That is truly the 
heart of a servant leader. 
I 
would 
also 
like 
to 
recognize 
Carolyn’s husband, Doug, who also 
served our great State for many years 
as director of the South Dakota State 
Parks. Together, Carolyn and Doug 
have positively impacted so many 
South Dakotans. 
The State of South Dakota is truly 
proud of Carolyn Hofer and wishes her 
all the best.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING ARNE SORENSON 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the esteemed legacy of 
my friend, Arne Sorenson, who passed 
away earlier this year. Arne’s many ac-
complishments in his personal and pro-
fessional life continue to profoundly 
impact the lives of many. Most re-
cently, Arne’s Marriott family, num-
bering over 120,000 employees, wit-
nessed his high-caliber leadership as he 
navigated the company through a tur-
bulent period in the hospitality indus-
try. Arne was a faithful and compas-
sionate servant leader, and I will al-
ways cherish his friendship. 
Arne’s contagious spirit of kindness 
and generosity sets a high standard for 
what success looks like, in both public 
and private life. As a business execu-
tive, he cared deeply for his employees 
and customers and continued to serve 
as president and CEO while privately 
persevering 
through 
extraordinary 
health challenges. His selfless leader-
ship is an example we can all aspire to. 
The culture he helped build and fos-
ter at Marriott is unmatched. Arne’s 
decades of experience in the hospitality 
industry yielded outstanding results 
for his enterprise, notably the acquisi-
tion of over 30 hotel groups, elevating 
Marriott to be the largest hotel chain 
in the world. His humility and wisdom 
often carried the day. He consistently 
praised and recognized the achieve-
ments of his employees and partners 
and 
always 
sought 
feedback 
from 
friends, family, colleagues, and cus-
tomers. 
Above all, Arne was a faithful and 
loving husband, father, and friend. His 
integrity and values-based decision 
making extended from the business 
world to the benefit of everyone lucky 
enough to have known him, especially 
his wonderful family. Arne’s wife and 
four children were his greatest pride, 
joy, and purpose, and while they now 
mourn his loss, I hope they may find 
comfort knowing Arne’s light will 
shine on for eternity. May he rest in 
peace.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ANDREW KLEIN 
∑ Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, today I 
wish to thank Andrew Klein for his re-
markable tenure as dean of the Indiana 
University Robert H. McKinney School 
of Law. Of the 21 years Mr. Klein has 
served the law school, he spent seven 
serving as its dean. 
Under Mr. Klein’s leadership, IU 
McKinney acquired national recogni-
tion as one of the best value law 
schools. 
Additionally, 
the 
school’s 
legal writing and health law programs 
have often been ranked among the top 
in the country by U.S. News & World 
Report. 
Over the course of his years as dean 
of IU McKinney, Mr. Klein frequently 
called the position the greatest honor 
of his professional life. Those who 
worked with Mr. Klein in this capacity 
admired him for his people-focused and 
institutionally 
minded 
leadership 
style. Back home in Indiana, Mr. 
Klein’s service to the legal profession 
has not gone unrecognized. In 2019, he 
was presented with the Indianapolis 
Bar Association President’s Award for 
service to the legal profession and the 
Indiana University Bicentennial Medal 
for service in support of the univer-
sity’s mission. 
Upon announcing his retirement as 
dean, Mr. Klein made clear that his 
work at IU McKinney is not yet fin-
ished. In addition to his strong leader-
ship capabilities, Mr. Klein has a nat-
ural ability to teach and will continue 
to serve as a professor at the School of 
Law. His outstanding efforts as an in-
structor have earned him several pres-
tigious awards, including the Indiana 
University Trustees Teaching Award. 
Mr. Klein’s commendable service to 
the Indianapolis community extends 
beyond his role at IU McKinney. He 
serves on the board of directors for the 
Indianapolis Legal Aid Society, an or-
ganization 
committed 
to 
providing 
legal advice to vulnerable populations. 
Additionally, Mr. Klein serves on the 
board of directors for Play Ball Indi-
ana, an organization that fosters op-
portunities for inner-city youth to play 
baseball and grow as individuals. 
Mr. Klein’s retirement as dean of IU 
McKinney marks the end of a laudable 
chapter for the school, and I look for-
ward to seeing him continue to impact 
lives there while serving as a professor. 
I congratulate him on all his tremen-
dous achievements throughout his ca-
reer and look forward to his further 
contributions to the greater Indianap-
olis community and the State of Indi-
ana as a whole.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and 
Ms. STABENOW): 
S. 3166. A bill to amend title XIX of 
the Social Security Act to improve 
coverage of dental and oral health serv-
ices for adults under Medicaid, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Finance. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the 
COVID–19 pandemic continues to take 
a tremendous toll on our Nation. 
Healthcare 
workers 
have 
valiantly 
served our communities throughout 
the crisis. Still, we face unprecedented 
challenges, and this moment calls for 
historic action. 
The pandemic laid bare the gaps in 
our healthcare system and magnified 
longstanding inequities. Health inequi-
ties have been eating away at our com-
munities for many years, which is why 
I have fought for policies to reduce eco-
nomic and social inequalities overall— 
in short, access to nutrition, edu-
cation, and housing, and increased 
funding for social and mental health 
services. 
Earlier this year, Congress enacted 
some of those reforms in the American 
Rescue Plan Act, which is bringing 
much-needed help to Marylanders and 
Americans across the country. It was a 
strong investment to complement on-
going efforts to curtail the rapid spread 
of the virus, particularly as we grapple 
with more contagious variants, such as 
the Delta variant. Now, we have the 
opportunity to enhance that effort 
through the Build Back Better Act. 
Even with the significant invest-
ments in healthcare over the last year 
and a half, Americans are struggling to 
pay for their basic healthcare needs, 
like prescription medications and men-
tal healthcare. Waiting lists for home- 
and community-based services so indi-
viduals can age in place with dignity 
are in the thousands or tens of thou-
sands in States around the country. In 
my State of Maryland, over 30,000 sen-
iors and individuals are waiting to get 
access to home- and community-based 
services. 
Now, we have the opportunity to 
make prescription drugs more afford-
able, expand access to home- and com-
munity-based 
services, 
extend 
en-
hanced financial support to individuals 
in the individual market, and perma-
nently fund the Children’s Health In-
surance Program—CHIP. 
We have been working on these prob-
lems for years and, in some cases, for 
over a decade. Congress is long overdue 
in acting to remedy them. 
As we make these historic invest-
ments, we must also redouble our ef-
forts to address the longstanding gaps 
in healthcare access. For instance, we 
have 
a 
once-in-a-generation 
oppor-
tunity to make major reforms to the 
Medicare benefit. 
Earlier this year, I reintroduced the 
Medicare Dental Benefit Act, which 
would add dental benefits to Medicare. 
It would help more than 56 million sen-
iors and people with disabilities afford 
much-needed dental care. 
According to the Wisdom Tooth 
Project of Oral Health America, nearly 
70 percent of seniors lack or have lim-
ited access to dental insurance, and 
fewer than half have access to dental 
care each year. Those numbers are in-
excusable. We should be working to 
strengthen and expand access to qual-
ity, affordable dental care for all 
Americans, regardless of age or in-
come. 
That is why, today, I am introducing, 
along with Senator STABENOW, the 
Medicaid Dental Benefit Act, which 
would extend comprehensive dental 
health benefits to tens of millions of 
low-income Americans. 
Currently, States have flexibility to 
determine whether to provide dental 
benefits to adult Medicaid enrollees. 
Although most States, including my 
State, provide at least emergency den-
tal services for adults, fewer than half 
of the States provide comprehensive 
dental care. 
The consequences of such haphazard 
access could not be clearer: higher 
costs and worse outcomes. 
A recent report by the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality found 
that Black, Hispanic, and low-income 
adults visited the emergency room for 
dental care at the highest rates of any 
group in 2018. 
Many of you have heard me speak be-
fore of the tragic loss of Deamonte 
Driver, a 12-year-old Prince George’s 
County resident, in 2007. Deamonte’s 
death was particularly heartbreaking 
because it was entirely preventable. 
What started out as a toothache turned 
into a severe brain infection that could 
have been prevented by an $80 extrac-
tion. After multiple surgeries and a 
lengthy 
hospital 
stay, 
Deamonte 
passed away nearly 15 years ago, just a 
few miles from this building. 
It is imperative that we use this 
once-in-a-generation opportunity to in-
crease access to dental care, which will 
improve the overall health of millions. 
To echo former U.S. Surgeon General 
C. Everett Koop, ‘‘there is no health 
without oral health.’’ 
Adequate access to oral health is es-
sential to preventing tragedies like the 
death of Deamonte Driver from ever 
happening again. Let us continue to 
build upon the progress made today in 
advancing access to oral health to pro-
tect individuals around the country. 
As we work to pass this legislation, 
let us not lose sight of what is at stake. 
Just in the last few days, we have seen 
some 
of 
the 
best 
that 
American 
healthcare can provide, but also some 
of the worst.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7794 
November 4, 2021 
Vaccines are making a critical dif-
ference in the fight against COVID–19, 
and just this Wednesday, they will be 
available to all ages 5 and older. It is a 
momentous achievement and a great 
relief to families and communities 
around the Nation. 
At the same time, women in Texas 
are being denied access to reproductive 
healthcare while, on Monday, the Su-
preme Court heard oral arguments on 
two cases challenging the Texas anti- 
abortion law S.B. 8. Roe v. Wade has 
been the established legal precedent in 
this country for more than half a cen-
tury, but anti-choice activists continue 
to push policies like S.B. 8 that are 
sending this country and women’s 
health and well-being in the wrong di-
rection. Women and their healthcare 
should not be under constant threat. If 
we fail the women of America, we fail 
our Nation. 
Right now, we have a choice on how 
we as a nation want to emerge from 
the pandemic. We can continue on the 
same course, leaving millions of fami-
lies behind, or we can answer the call 
of the American people and invest in 
high-quality, equitable healthcare. 
Let us answer the call. 
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, Mr. PADILLA, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mrs. 
MURRAY, Mr. BROWN, Mr. SAND-
ERS, 
Ms. 
HIRONO, 
and 
Mr. 
LEAHY): 
S. 3177. A bill to restore protections 
for Social Security, Railroad retire-
ment, and Black Lung benefits from 
administrative offset; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Social 
Security provides vital benefits mil-
lions of Americans who work and pay 
into the system with each paycheck. 
Because 
Social 
Security 
is 
funda-
mental to workers’ retirement secu-
rity, the law protected benefits from 
creditors. The only exceptions were un-
paid Federal taxes, child support or ali-
mony payments, and court-ordered vic-
tim restitution. These protections en-
sured that the social safety net pro-
grams would be there for basic needs. 
That protection was weakened over 20 
years ago when the law was changed. 
Now, more and more seniors face cuts 
in their Social Security benefits be-
cause of student loan debts. While Con-
gress and the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion took significant steps to protect 
Americans from facing crushing debt 
during a global pandemic, exempting 
the economic impact payments from 
garnishment and extending the freeze 
on student loan payments through Jan-
uary 2022, seniors will still be on the 
hook for cosigning their child or grand-
child’s student loan debt when those 
payments resume. We need to take ac-
tion today to restore the strong protec-
tions to Social Security and other ben-
efit programs. 
We now realize what a profound ef-
fect the loss of these protections has 
had on retirees and individuals with 
disabilities, who often live on fixed in-
comes. More and more seniors and peo-
ple with disabilities are having their 
Social Security and other lifeline bene-
fits taken away to pay Federal debts. 
For example, according to recent data 
from the U.S. Bureau of Fiscal Service, 
over 167,000 Americans had their bene-
fits garnished for student loan debt. 
While 167,000 seems small compared to 
a nation of over 320 million, those 
167,000 had nearly $200 million gar-
nished from their earned benefits. This 
is just the tip of the iceberg as more 
Americans start receiving benefits. Be-
tween 2008 and 2018, the number of indi-
viduals whose Social Security benefits 
were offset to pay student loans debt 
increased by 133 percent, from about 
72,000 to 169,000. Over that same period, 
the amount collected from Social Secu-
rity benefits ballooned from almost $63 
million to nearly $200 million, a 217- 
percent increase. 
Social Security plays a critical role 
in keeping seniors and people with dis-
abilities out of poverty. In Oregon 
alone, Social Security cuts the poverty 
rate of the elderly from about 35 per-
cent to 5 percent. However, despite So-
cial Security’s critical role in the safe-
ty net, close to 1 out of every 10 seniors 
over age 65 and 1 in 5 disabled workers 
still live in poverty and that is simply 
unacceptable. 
I, along with Senators BROWN, WHITE-
HOUSE, LEAHY, WARREN, HIRONO. SAND-
ERS, PADILLA, VAN HOLLEN, and MUR-
RAY am reintroducing the Protection of 
Social Security Benefits Restoration 
Act. The bill would restore the strong 
protections in the law that prevented 
the government from taking away 
earned benefits to pay Federal debts, 
and guarantee beneficiaries will be able 
to maintain a basic standard of living 
by receiving the benefits they have 
earned. The bill is supported by the 
Strengthen Social Security Coalition, 
Social Security Works, National Asso-
ciation of Disability Representatives, 
AFL-CIO, the American Federation of 
Government Employees, National Or-
ganization of Social Security Claim-
ants’ 
Representatives, 
Justice 
in 
Aging, American Federation of Teach-
ers, Alliance for Retired Americans, 
and the National Committee to Pre-
serve Social Security & Medicare. 
I ask unanimous consent that the bill 
be printed in the RECORD following this 
statement.

resentatives of the United States of America in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7795 
November 4, 2021 
S. 3179. A bill making appropriations 
for financial services and general gov-
ernment for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2022, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Appropriations. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the Fiscal Year 
2022 Financial Services and General 
Government Appropriations Act, which 
will help fund essential government 
programs that invest in the success of 
everyday Americans and help build a 
stronger, more resilient economy with 
greater opportunity and more shared 
prosperity for all. 
As chair of the Financial Services 
and General Government Appropria-
tions Subcommittee, I developed this 
bill with the help of Ranking Member 
CINDY
HYDE-SMITH
from Mississippi, 
and I want to begin by thanking her 
and 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
staff on both sides that have helped as-
semble this legislation. Putting to-
gether any one piece of the Federal 
budget is beyond the power of any one 
individual; it takes a dedicated team of 
public servants working shoulder-to- 
shoulder, day-in and day-out—and com-
mitted to delivering real results for the 
American people. I appreciate Senator 
HYDE-SMITH’s partnership on our sub-
committee, and I also want to thank 
Senator LEAHY and Ranking Member 
SHELBY for their leadership on the full 
committee. 
And in addition to my colleagues and 
partners on Capitol Hill who have con-
tributed to this legislation, our work 
has also been guided by the input of 
others, outside of the Senate, who have 
offered their testimony and insight. In 
order to craft this spending package, 
the Financial Services and General 
Government Subcommittee held public 
hearings with the Treasury Depart-
ment and the IRS, a public hearing to 
help understand Postal Service deliv-
ery issues, and a public hearing to 
learn about the important role of Com-
munity Development banks in eco-
nomically challenged communities. We 
were briefed by an array of agencies 
under the bill’s jurisdictions and met 
with stakeholders who would be di-
rectly affected by key elements of this 
legislation, including residents from 
my home State of Maryland. 
The result of those combined efforts 
can be seen in the substance of this 
year’s Financial Services and General 
Government spending bill, which pro-
vides $29.4 billion to bring critical serv-
ices to the American people by funding 
a number of important Federal agen-
cies and government bodies from the 
Treasury Department to the Small 
Business Administration to the Federal 
Judiciary to the D.C. courts—and much 
more. Today, I would like to share with 
the American people exactly what is in 
this bill and how they stand to benefit 
from the provisions within it. 
First and foremost, this bill arms the 
IRS with the resources it needs to 
ramp up customer service. This bill in-
cludes $13.6 billion for the IRS, an in-
crease of $1.6 billion over last year’s 
spending levels, and these funds will 
allow the IRS to bring taxpayer serv-
ices into the 21st century by upgrading 
and replacing aging IRS infrastructure. 
For working families, that means im-
proved service and shorter hold times 
when they call the IRS with questions. 
That additional funding will also 
allow the IRS to go after those ultra- 
wealthy tax cheats who have avoided 
paying what they owe to the govern-
ment. Now, let’s be clear: Each year, 
millions of folks pay what they owe, 
fill out their tax forms, and send them 
in to the IRS honestly and on time, and 
they trust that others do the same. But 
we know that while most people pay 
what they are required to under the 
law, some do not. There is anywhere 
from $500 billion to $1 trillion in taxes 
each year that are owed but not paid, 
primarily by the wealthy. That is bil-
lions of dollars that are overdue under 
current law and which should be avail-
able to help fund everything from edu-
cation to our national defense. Both 
my Republican and Democratic col-
leagues know that doing nothing and 
allowing this tax gap to grow on our 
watch just isn’t right. It flies in the 
face of basic fairness. While everyday 
Americans have their taxes withheld 
and follow the law, we cannot allow the 
super wealthy to evade the system. Ev-
eryone needs to pay what they owe. By 
enhancing the agility of the IRS to 
crack down on individuals who sidestep 
their current tax responsibilities, we 
can raise more revenue without raising 
taxes by a single dime. 
The investment in a robust IRS will 
deliver additional monies to invest in 
growing opportunity and wealth in all 
of our communities, including under-
served communities. And that mission 
has taken on an added measure of ur-
gency as our country continues to re-
cover from the economic fallout of 
COVID–19. Our bill helps meet the full 
promise of that very mission by pro-
viding $360 million for the Community 
Development 
Financial 
Institutions 
Fund, a $90 million increase from last 
year’s spending levels. CDFIs are key 
vehicles for funding businesses and 
projects in economically underserved 
communities. My State of Maryland is 
proud to have 13 certified community- 
based lenders across our State that 
benefit directly from the CDFI fund L, 
and earlier this year, I chaired a sub-
committee hearing that included testi-
mony from a Maryland constituent and 
valued adviser, Mr. Joseph Haskins, 
Jr., who is the chairman of Harbor 
Bank in Baltimore, a certified CDFI 
that has helped create $3 billion in eco-
nomic development in the Baltimore 
community since its founding in 2001. 
And just last month, I convened a 
roundtable with Shelly Gross-Wade, 
the CEO of the only CDFI in Prince 
George’s County, MD, to discuss how 
we can better support minority small 
businesses across the region. Commu-
nity lenders support a wide range of 
local projects, including everything 
from bringing grocery stores to com-
munities with no healthy food alter-
natives to investing in low-income 
housing, and I am glad that we were 
able to include robust funding for 
CDFIs in this year’s bill. 
On top of that, this bill provides ad-
ditional resources for communities and 
small businesses through $1 billion for 
the Small Business Administration, so 
we can make sure businesses continue 
to recover from the pandemic—and can 
grow stronger into the future. Small 
businesses are the backbone of our 
economy, and this spending bill puts 
that notion front-and-center in our 
Federal budget. I am proud that this 
legislation also includes a $53 million 
increase for Entrepreneurial Develop-
ment Grants that will encourage entre-
preneurs to build businesses and create 
good-paying 
jobs—including 
entre-
preneurs 
from 
historically 
under- 
served communities. 
Money that goes to the SBA will also 
help make sure our small businesses 
have the support they need to get back 
on their feet in the wake of devastating 
natural disasters, which we all know 
have been on the rise due to the grow-
ing and very real consequences of cli-
mate change, an issue that demands 
this government’s full and undivided 
attention. Extreme weather events get 
worse and worse each year, and my 
State of Maryland is feeling the pain of 
that trend right now in the aftermath 
of Tropical Depression Ida. I am glad 
that the Small Business Administra-
tion approved Maryland’s request for a 
Disaster Declaration for those im-
pacted by Ida, which has unlocked ad-
ditional low-interest loans for busi-
nesses and homeowners in affected 
communities and emphasizes how just 
important the SBA is in helping our 
fellow citizens endure the impacts of 
climate change. 
But if we want to tackle the climate 
crisis head-on, it isn’t enough for us to 
support those who have already been 
harmed by the devastating effects of 
global warming; we also need to cut 
emissions. That is why this bill invests 
$200 million in transitioning the Fed-
eral fleet to zero-emission vehicles. 
There are currently around 655,000 gas- 
powered vehicles in the federal fleet 
that spew more than 7 billion pounds of 
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
each year. With this bill, that will 
change. We need to take an all-of-gov-
ernment approach to tackling the cli-
mate crisis, and this provision within 
our legislation helps us do just that. 
And as we invest in the health of our 
planet, we also need to invest in the 
health of our democracy and I am glad 
that this bill is a big win for increased 
campaign finance transparency in two 
major ways. First, this legislation 
drops 
a 
long-standing 
rider 
that 
blocked the SEC from requiring public 
companies to share their political 
spending 
with 
shareholders. 
Share-
holders and the public have a right to 
know 
what 
political 
causes 
their 
money is being used to support, deci-
sions that can go against their values

or put their investments at risk. Our 
legislation will enable the SEC to shine 
a light on that secret spending. And 
second, the bill drops a longstanding 
rider that blocked the Treasury from 
clarifying the definition of ‘‘political 
activity’’ for 501(c)(4) social welfare 
group, which are major sources of se-
cret election spending. 
More transparency in political fund-
raising is part of the essential mission 
to restore faith in government. Toward 
that same end, this bill also mandates 
greater transparency in how the Office 
of Management and Budget manages 
apportionments, which is the process of 
spending the money that Congress ap-
propriates. And additionally, this bill 
works to ensure that our government 
represents the full diversity of the 
United States by expanding opportuni-
ties for DREAMers so that DACA re-
cipients can be employed by the Fed-
eral Government. DREAMers should be 
able to bring their skills, talents, and 
unique 
perspectives 
to 
government 
jobs, where decisions affecting their 
communities are made every day, and 
our legislation allows them to partici-
pate fully in public service. This legis-
lation also includes an increase in 
funding to the White House that would 
allow for paid internships, and I urge 
the President to use these funds to 
offer the opportunity to enter Federal 
service to more young people. 
But while we work to recruit more of 
our fellow Americans to serve, we also 
need to ensure that those who are cur-
rently serving can work in offices that 
meet their full needs. That is why I am 
particularly pleased to include lan-
guage in this bill urging the General 
Service Administration and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation to move 
forward on the proposed new, consoli-
dated FBI headquarter, a process that 
was abruptly halted by the last admin-
istration. The FBI currently works in a 
crumbling building that fails to meet 
its operational and security needs, and 
it is time to move forward on the proc-
ess of securing a new campus. I would 
be remiss if I did not note that Mary-
land, which is already home to many 
FBI employees, has two fully vetted 
sites in this process. I am committed 
to getting this new campus, which is 
over a decade in the making, finally 
completed to meet the needs of the 
FBI’ s mission. 
And in addition to strengthening the 
core planks of government by expand-
ing transparency, helping grow path-
ways to service, and upgrading Federal 
buildings, the Financial Services and 
General Government bill also strength-
ens the government’s ability to take on 
pressing crises facing our communities, 
including our Nation’s ongoing chal-
lenges with addiction. It provides a 9- 
percent increase in funding for the Of-
fice of National Drug Control Policy, 
including resources for the High-Inten-
sity Drug Trafficking Areas program 
and the Drug-Free Communities pro-
gram, which helps prevent drug addic-
tion among our Nation’s youth. Sub-
stance use disorders continue to tear at 
the fabric of our communities, includ-
ing in my home State of Maryland, and 
this vital funding is essential both to 
stopping illegal drug trafficking and to 
healing my State and States across the 
country that have been plagued by ad-
diction. 
Finally, I would also like to note 
that this bill ends harmful riders that 
have interfered with the District of Co-
lumbia’s ability to spend its own tax-
payer dollars, an example of Congres-
sional meddling in local affairs that no 
Senator would tolerate toward their 
own State. And this bill includes $760 
million in special Federal payments for 
over a dozen distinct purposes relating 
to DC, including $40 million for the DC 
Tuition Assistance Grant Program to 
expand higher education choices for 
students of the District. And at a time 
when we see attacks on a women’s 
right to choose across this country, I 
am proud to say this bill ends years of 
restrictions to abortion care by drop-
ping a rider that prohibited the Dis-
trict of Columbia—and Federal health 
insurance 
systems—from 
providing 
coverage for abortion services. This is 
sound policy that the majority of 
Americans support, and this provision 
is essential to protecting reproductive 
freedoms in this country. 
In short, this legislation enhances 
services that help everyday people, 
builds more economic opportunity, up-
lifts working families, delivers support 
directly to our communities, fights cli-
mate change, strengthens our democ-
racy, accelerates our work to mod-
ernize the IRS, and does much, much 
more, and we must get it to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
While I wish we could consider this 
bill under regular order, have a con-
ference with the House and sign it into 
law, we are quickly running out of 
time. It is imperative that we enact 
this spending bill and the other 11 ap-
propriations bills by December 3 when 
the current continuing resolution runs 
out to avoid a government shutdown, 
and in order to meet that deadline, we 
will likely be negotiating an omnibus. 
I look forward to working with Rank-
ing Member HYDE-SMITH and our House 
colleagues to move this process for-
ward immediately because we have no 
time to waste. So let’s now push ahead 
with our work, finish these bills, and 
do the job the American people sent us 
here to do. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and 
Mr. CARDIN): 
S. 3183. A bill to amend title 10, 
United States Code, to establish a pro-
gram of the Department of Defense to 
carry 
out 
stormwater 
management 
projects on or related to military in-
stallations to improve the resilience of 
military installations and defense ac-
cess roads and protect waterways and 
stormwater-stressed ecosystems; to the 
Committee on Armed Services. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing a bill to improve 
stormwater management practices at 
Department of Defense, DOD installa-
tions across the country. 
Climate related impacts, such as in-
creased rainfall intensity and sea level 
rise, 
exacerbate 
the 
problem 
of 
stormwater runoff. Excess stormwater 
can threaten our military readiness 
and pollute surrounding waterways and 
ecosystems. 
This phenomenon is acutely present 
in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, 
where DOD is the second largest Fed-
eral landholder, and stormwater is the 
only pollutant in the watershed that 
continues to increase. Therefore, it is 
imperative that the DOD, as an official 
partner to the Chesapeake Bay Pro-
gram, do all that it can to support re-
duction in pollution runoff consistent 
with the State-based watershed imple-
mentation plans required by the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency. Climate 
change has put numerous Virginia and 
Maryland military bases at increased 
risk of flooding, including Naval Sta-
tion 
Norfolk, 
Naval 
Air 
Station 
Oceana, Naval Support Activity Hamp-
ton Roads, Langley Air Force Base, 
Naval 
Support 
Activity 
Annapolis, 
Naval 
Support 
Activity 
Bethesda, 
Naval Air Station Patuxent River, 
Joint Base Andrews, and Naval Sup-
port Activity South Potomac. 
While there are 137 DOD installa-
tions, sites, and facilities in the Chesa-
peake Bay watershed, this proposal 
will help ensure stormwater and nat-
ural resources beat management prac-
tices are constructed, maintained, and 
repaired at DOD facilities across the 
Nation. 
The Federal Government provides 
State and local governments with bil-
lions in financial assistance each year 
to invest in stormwater infrastructure 
through the Clean Water State Revolv-
ing Fund. Very limited funding exists 
for the financing of stormwater infra-
structure on military installations. 
The 
EMBRACE 
Act 
would 
make 
stormwater management projects eligi-
ble for Federal funding under either 
military construction projects, mili-
tary installation resilience projects, 
unspecified minor military construc-
tion projects, defense access roads 
projects, the Defense Community Infra-
structure Program DCIP, and the En-
ergy Resilience and Conservation In-
vestment Program ERCIP. 
The bill instructs the Defense De-
partment to give priority to projects 
that retrofit buildings and grounds on 
bases and improve access roads prone 
to flooding. It backs the building of 
stormwater ponds and other retention 
strategies. It also supports replacing 
impermeable paving with materials 
that let water seep into the soil rather 
than run off. Projects such as rain gar-
dens, cisterns, and planters also would 
be eligible for funds. 
I am proud to be joined in this effort 
by Senators WARNER, CARDIN, and VAN 
HOLLEN. The bill has also been en-
dorsed by critical partners such as the 
Chesapeake 
Bay 
Commission,

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. 
MARSHALL, 
Mrs. 
GILLI-
BRAND, and Ms. ERNST): 
S. 3203. A bill to establish the Com-
mission on the COVID–19 Pandemic; to 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak in support of my bi-
partisan bill, the National Commission 
on the COVID–19 Pandemic Act. This 
bill would establish a 9/11-style Com-
mission to conduct an investigation on 
the COVID–19 outbreak and identify 
lessons learned regarding preparedness, 
response, and recovery. I would like to 
thank my cosponsors, Senators MAR-
SHALL, GILLIBRAND, and ERNST, for 
joining me in introducing this crucial 
bill. 
Like we did after the devastating 
September 11 terrorist attacks, our bill 
would establish a bipartisan Commis-
sion on the COVID–19 pandemic to bet-
ter understand the vulnerabilities it 
has revealed in our national security 
and healthcare system and improve our 
preparedness for future crises. 
It is crucial to improve our under-
standing 
of 
pandemic 
threats 
and 
health issues that the United States 
could face in the coming decades to 
better protect our population and miti-
gate the risk of a similar human and 
economic catastrophe in the future. 
To date, COVID–19 has caused more 
than 750,000 deaths in the United States 
and infected at least 46 million people. 
Beyond the devastating toll it has 
taken on human lives, the pandemic re-
vealed vulnerabilities in our prepared-
ness for dealing with such a deadly 
virus. 
At the beginning of the U.S. out-
break, hospitals struggled to secure 
enough personal protective equipment 
to keep health workers safe. As the 
pandemic worsened, we saw additional 
shortages in critical medical equip-
ment like ventilators and other med-
ical products that save lives, including 
testing supplies. 
As we waited for effective treatments 
and vaccines to be developed and ap-
proved, testing and mask wearing sup-
plemented with physical distancing 
and 
other 
nonpharmaceutical tools 
were our only weapons combating the 
spread of the virus. However, we knew 
these tactics alone wouldn’t ultimately 
defeat the virus. 
After unprecedented scientific col-
laboration and innovation, we now fi-
nally 
have 
three 
FDA-approved 
COVID–19 vaccines that are safe, effec-
tive, and free for all Americans. While 
getting as many people vaccinated as 
possible remains the only path out of 
the pandemic, barriers to access and 
misunderstanding about the safety of 
the vaccines have delayed too many 
Americans from getting their vaccine. 
Disturbingly, throughout the pan-
demic, we have seen an increase in hate 
crimes against the Asian American and 
Pacific Islander community due to ra-
cially discriminatory language related 
to COVID–19. Possible underreporting 
means this problem may be even more 
prevalent than we know. 
Finally, after examining all available 
intelligence reporting and information, 
the intelligence community remains 
divided on the most likely origin of 
COVID–19. According to the latest de-
classified assessment on COVID–19 ori-
gins, more information is needed to 
provide a more definitive explanation 
of how the virus emerged. 
The Commission that would be estab-
lished by our bipartisan bill would con-
duct a comprehensive investigation of 
our government’s preparedness and re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic and 
make recommendations on how we can 
be better prepared in the future. 
Modeled after the 9/11 Commission, 
this investigative body would com-
plement other oversight efforts in Con-
gress and the administration. 
The Commission would be composed 
of 10 members who aren’t current Fed-
eral officials, with the same partisan 
balance as the 9/11 Commissioners and 
with a variety of backgrounds in rel-
evant fields, including public health, 
epidemiology, emergency preparedness, 
medical intelligence, and others; pro-
vide a full accounting to the President, 
Congress, and the American people of 
the facts and circumstances related to 
the outbreak in the United States as 
well as abroad, including our prepared-
ness, the intelligence and information 
we had available before the virus 
reached the United States, and how 
Federal, State, and local governments, 
as well as the private sector, responded 
to the crisis; and gather information 
and hold hearings to eventually publish 
public reports on the Commission’s 
findings and recommendations. 
The 
global 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
showed just how unprepared we were to 
respond to a major public health threat 
that has continued for almost 2 years. 
This lack of readiness caused wide-
spread shutdowns of society in the 
United States and across the globe, re-
sulting in a number of preventable 
deaths too high to comprehend. 
As we mourn those we lost, we must 
acknowledge that this pandemic is still 
not over and the threat of a new virus 
emerging that has greater pandemic 
potential looms. This Commission will 
ensure we learn from our achievements 
as well as our tragedies during this 
modem plague so that it may never 
happen again. 
I want to thank the Infectious Dis-
eases Society of America for their sup-
port of our bill, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to pass it.

Whereas more than 25,000,000 listeners in

ists, and genres that are, in many cases, 
available only on public radio;

munities in all 50 States, the District of Co-
lumbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam;

casts of classical music in the United States

sential and indispensable force in—

nities; 
Whereas local public radio music stations

ences through an expanding range of plat-

ing by maintaining connections with artists

ized programming; 
Whereas the demonstrated commitment of 
public radio music stations to community 
service, education, and cultural support sep-
arates nonprofit local public radio stations

446—COM-
MENDING THE GOVERNMENT OF 
LITHUANIA FOR ITS RESOLVE IN 
INCREASING TIES WITH TAIWAN 
AND 
SUPPORTING 
ITS 
FIRM 
STANCE AGAINST COERCION BY 
THE 
CHINESE 
COMMUNIST 
PARTY 
Mr. RISCH (for himself and Mrs. SHA-
HEEN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 446 
Whereas, on May 20, 2021, the parliament of 
Lithuania passed a resolution in which it 
recognized the People’s Republic of China’s 
treatment of the Uyghurs and members of 
Muslim 
and 
minority 
communities 
in 
Xinjiang region as a genocide, called upon 
the United Nations to investigate the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China’s internment camps 
for Uyghurs, and asked the European Com-
mission to review its relationship with the 
People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, on May 21, 2021, Lithuania with-
drew from the 17+1 format that facilitates 
collaboration between Central and Eastern 
European nations and the People’s Republic 
of China; 
Whereas the 17+1 was designed by the Chi-
nese Communist Party (CCP) to both create 
business and cultural exchange opportunities 
for the People’s Republic of China, and to di-
vide European nations on sub-regional issues 
regarding the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, on June 22, 2021, the Government 
of Lithuania announced its donation of 20,000 
COVID–19 vaccines to Taiwan after the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China blocked Taiwan from 
participation in the world-wide COVAX vac-
cine sharing scheme; 
Whereas, on July 20, 2021, the Government 
of Lithuania announced the establishment of 
exchange offices with Taiwan under the 
name of the Taiwanese Representative Of-
fice; 
Whereas the CCP has aggressively pun-
ished other organizations and nations for 
using the name ‘‘Taiwan’’ to refer to the is-
land, rather than referring to it by the CCP 
preferred ‘‘Chinese Taipei’’, a practice by 
which the CCP seeks to force other nations 
to conform to its view that Taiwan is a part 
of China; 
Whereas, in retaliation to the Government 
of Lithuania’s announcement of the Tai-
wanese Representative Office, the CCP im-
plemented severe economic restrictions on 
Lithuania; 
Whereas, on August 10, 2021, the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China pro-
tested the announcement of the new Lithua-
nian office in Taiwan by recalling its ambas-
sador to Vilnius, and demanding that Lith-
uania remove its ambassador from Beijing; 
Whereas, on September 4, 2021, Lithuania’s 
Ambassador to China, Diana Mickevicˇiene˙, 
returned to Vilnius; 
Whereas Lithuania’s European neighbors 
and European Union (EU) leaders have com-
mended Lithuania’s bravery and have ex-
pressed willingness to stand in solidarity 
with 
Lithuania’s 
decision, 
including 
by 
issuing a joint letter from European Par-
liament members on September 3, 2021; 
Whereas, on September 15, 2021, Secretary 
of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed the 
United States commitment to Lithuania, 
stating, ‘‘Lithuania and the United States 
are very strong partners in NATO. We stand 
together for collective defense and security. 
We stand against economic coercion, includ-
ing that being exerted by China.’’; 
Whereas, on September 21, 2021, the Min-
istry of National Defence in Lithuania rec-
ommended that citizens not purchase phones 
manufactured in the People’s Republic of 
China and throw away their existing phones, 
after evidence emerged that the devices have 
censorship technology built in; 
Whereas, on September 22, 2021, the Gov-
ernment of Lithuania announced an addi-
tional vaccine donation to Taiwan totaling 
235,900 doses; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China has 
engaged in economic coercion to punish 
countries that do not do as the CCP wishes, 
including by banning the import of Aus-
tralian wine and agricultural products after 
the Government of Australia supported 
launching an international investigation 
into the origins of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
closing South Korean department stores and 
tourism after the Republic of Korea deployed 
the United States Terminal High Altitude 
Area Defense missile battery, restricting im-
ports from the Philippines after that nation 
protested the People’s Republic of China’s 
assertive and unlawful actions in Scar-
borough Shoal, and cutting the imports of 
Norwegian salmon after Norway awarded a 
Chinese dissident with the Nobel Prize; 
Whereas the CCP regularly uses its eco-
nomic power to pressure Taiwan’s diplomatic 
allies to cut ties with the island and instead 
diplomatically recognize the People’s Repub-
lic of China, as was it did most recently with 
the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, leaving 
Taiwan with just 15 diplomatic allies; and 
Whereas the CCP has repeatedly and con-
tinuously barred Taiwan from meaningful 
participation in key international organiza-
tions such as the World Health Organization, 
International Civil Aviation Organization, 
and other United Nations organizations and 
affiliated mechanisms in an attempt to dip-
lomatically isolate Taiwan: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the Government of Lith-
uania for its decision to deepen ties with 
Taiwan and standing up to the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s unfair coercion and pressure; 
(2) commits to supporting Lithuania and 
Taiwan in the face of these challenges, in-
cluding by exploring ways to increase eco-
nomic cooperation with both countries; 
(3) encourages European allies to continue 
to stand in solidarity with Lithuania against 
aggression from the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; 
(4) encourages the Lithuanian business 
community to continue to seek opportuni-
ties for investment and growth with reliable 
partners outside of the People’s Republic of 
China’s abusive economic system; 
(5) expresses concern with the CCP’s ag-
gressive actions and attempts to influence

CONCURRENT 
RESOLU-
TION 20—CONDEMNING THE OC-
TOBER 25, 2021, MILITARY COUP 
IN SUDAN AND STANDING WITH 
THE PEOPLE OF SUDAN 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
RISCH) submitted the following concur-
rent resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. CON RES. 20 
Whereas the people of the Republic of 
Sudan suffered for three decades under the 
despotic rule of President Omar Hassan 
Ahmad al-Bashir, whose government was re-
sponsible for the suppression of civil lib-
erties, grand corruption, support for inter-
national terrorism, and the commission of 
crimes against humanity and genocide; 
Whereas, throughout 2019, a coalition of 
Sudanese civic groups, including professional 
associations, 
labor 
unions, 
community 
groups, democracy activists, and opposition 
parties, led a mass protest movement to de-
mand the end of Bashir’s reign and the tran-
sition to democracy in Sudan; 
Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Sudanese mili-
tary officers deposed Bashir, and, following 
continued protests, agreed to form a transi-
tional government in partnership with a ci-
vilian pro-democracy coalition on July 17, 
2019; 
Whereas, on June 3, 2019, Sudanese forces 
led by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), 
largely comprised of Janjaweed militia in-
volved in genocidal campaigns across Darfur 
for decades, opened fire on protesters at an 
army command headquarters in Khartoum, 
killing at least 127 people, at least 40 of 
whom were found in the Nile River; 
Whereas the military and civilian elements 
agreed to a 39-month transition to democ-
racy, with a Civilian-Led Transitional Gov-
ernment (CLTG) comprised of a predomi-
nantly civilian cabinet led by Prime Min-
ister Abdallah Hamdok, a Sovereign Council, 
an executive body with civilian and military 
members chaired for the first half of the 
transitional period by Lieutenant General 
Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and a Transitional 
Legislative Council, which has yet to be 
formed; 
Whereas the United States and the inter-
national community supported Sudan’s tran-
sition to democracy, with the United States 
identifying more than $1,000,000,000 in foreign 
assistance, and the multilateral Friends of 
Sudan group pledging $1,800,000,000 from 
roughly 50 countries and international orga-
nizations; 
Whereas the CLTG made progress in 
human rights reforms, including guaran-
teeing the people of Sudan freedom of reli-
gion and gender equality under the transi-
tional constitution, banning female genital 
mutilation, and decriminalizing apostasy; 
Whereas, in August 2021, when the Suda-
nese Cabinet ratified the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court (ICC), the 
CLTG made progress towards ending impu-
nity for abusers of human rights, stating its 
intention to deliver Omar al-Bashir to the 
ICC to stand trial for genocide, war crimes, 
and crimes against humanity, and formed ci-
vilian committees to investigate corruption 
and crimes against humanity perpetrated by 
the Bashir regime; 
Whereas the transitional government nego-
tiated a peace agreement with several rebel 
groups, a step towards ending decades of con-
flict 
in 
the 
regions 
of 
Darfur, 
South 
Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which killed hun-
dreds of thousands of civilians and left more 
than 3,000,000 people displaced within Sudan; 
Whereas Sudan continues to face a serious 
humanitarian situation, with an estimated 
13,400,000 people, or 29 percent of the popu-
lation, in need of humanitarian assistance in 
2021; 
Whereas Sudan faces a severe economic 
crisis, exacerbated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, which caused the price of food and 
consumer goods to increase significantly, 
while austerity measures imposed to sta-
bilize the economy resulted in the reduction 
or elimination of subsidies for commodities 
including wheat and fuel; 
Whereas the political tensions between the 
civilian and military elements and within 
factions of the civilian coalition undermined 
the CLTG and contributed to widespread un-
rest within the Sudanese population relating 
to a range of issues, including the economic 
crisis, ethnic and tribal conflict in periph-
eral regions, and the unsatisfactory pace of 
reforms; 
Whereas, on September 21, 2021, some mem-
bers of the military reportedly attempted a 
coup d’e´tat against the transitional govern-
ment, which failed to depose the government 
but succeeded in precipitating the most seri-
ous political crisis of the transition period; 
Whereas, on October 21, 2021, hundreds of 
thousands of people across Sudan dem-
onstrated in support of democratic civilian 
rule, to counter a smaller protest days prior 
demanding the military take complete con-
trol of the government; 
Whereas, on October 25, 2021, Lieutenant 
General Burhan, with the support of General 
Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as 
‘‘Hemedti’’, seized control of the govern-
ment, deployed the military to the streets of 
Khartoum and Omdurman, and arrested and 
detained Prime Minister Hamdok and other 
civilian officials; 
Whereas the African Union Peace and Se-
curity Council convened on October 27, 2021, 
strongly condemned the coup, reaffirmed the 
mandate of the CLTG, and subsequently sus-
pended Sudan from the regional body ‘‘with 
immediate effect. . . until the effective res-
toration’’ of the CLTG; 
Whereas the actions of Lieutenant General 
Burhan and the Sudanese military violate 
Sudan’s Constitutional Charter and threaten 
to plunge Sudan into isolation and insta-
bility; 
Whereas the United States Government 
publicly condemned the coup, suspended its 
foreign assistance to Sudan, and urged Lieu-
tenant General Burhan and his accomplices 
to restore the CLTG and return Sudan to the 
path to democracy; and 
Whereas, the Troika (the United States, 
United Kingdom, Norway), the European 
Union, and Switzerland ‘‘continue to recog-
nize the Prime Minister and his cabinet as 
the constitutional leaders of the transitional 
government’’ and ‘‘confirm once again the 
international calls for the immediate return 
to the roadmap for democratic transition of 
Sudan’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) condemns the October 25, 2021, coup in 
Sudan; 
(2) stands with the people of Sudan in their 
democratic aspirations; 
(3) recognizes the Prime Minister and his 
cabinet as the constitutional leaders of Su-
dan’s transitional government; 
(4) calls for Sudan’s military junta to— 
(A) immediately release all civilian gov-
ernment officials, civil society members, and 
other individuals detained in connection 
with the coup; 
(B) return to constitutional rule under the 
transitional constitution as the starting 
point for negotiations with civilians toward 
full civilian rule; 
(C) lift the state of emergency, including 
complete restoration of all means of commu-
nication; 
(D) remove all roadblocks and checkpoints, 
and order the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 
and RSF to stand down and comply with 
international recognized rules of engage-
ment; 
(E) ensure security forces respect the right 
to peaceful protest and hold those who used 
excessive force and committed other abuses 
accountable in a transparent, credible proc-
ess; 
(F) cease all attempts to change the civil-
ian composition of the cabinet, Sovereign 
Council, and other government bodies; and 
(G) transfer leadership of the Sovereign 
Council to a civilian member of the Sov-
ereign Council in keeping with the transi-
tional constitution; 
(5) calls on the Secretary of State to— 
(A) immediately identify coup leaders, 
their accomplices, and enablers for consider-
ation for targeted sanctions; 
(B) urge junta leaders to return imme-
diately to the rule of law as set forth by the 
transitional constitution; 
(C) monitor, discourage, and deter any ef-
fort by external parties to support the coup 
and the military junta; 
(D) coordinate with— 
(i) the Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development and 
other Federal Government agencies to pause 
all non-humanitarian bilateral assistance to 
Sudan until restoration of the transitional 
constitutional order; 
(ii) the Department of the Treasury to use 
the voice and vote of the United States in 
international financial institutions to sus-
pend all actions related to non-humanitarian 
loans or debt relief to Sudan until restora-
tion of the transitional constitutional order; 
and 
(iii) the United States Permanent Rep-
resentative to the United Nations to ensure 
the United Nations Security Council is 
seized of the matter on an ongoing basis; and 
(E) work with the Troika to engage mem-
bers of the international community to join 
these United States actions; and 
(6) calls on international partners to— 
(A) join United States efforts to impose 
targeted sanctions on the junta and other ac-
complices to the coup, monitor, discourage, 
and deter any effort by external parties to 
support the junta, and urge junta leaders to 
return to the rule of law as set forth by the 
transitional constitution; and 
(B) suspend Sudan’s participation in all re-
gional 
multilateral 
organizations 
until 
Sudan is returned to constitutional rule 
under the transitional constitution.

SEC. lll02. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) Vieques is an island municipality of 
Puerto Rico, measuring approximately 21 
miles long by 4 miles wide, and located ap-
proximately 8 miles east of the main island 
of Puerto Rico. 
(2) Prior to Hurricane Maria, residents of 
Vieques were served by an urgent medical 
care facility, the Susana Centeno Family 
Health Center, and residents had to travel 
off-island to obtain medical services, includ-
ing most types of emergency care because 
the facility did not have the basic use of x- 
ray machines, CT machines, EKG machines, 
ultrasounds, or PET scans. 
(3) The predominant means of transporting 
passengers and goods between Vieques and 
the main island of Puerto Rico is by ferry 
boat service, and over the years, the effi-
ciency of this service has frequently been 
disrupted, unreliable, and difficult for cancer 
patients to endure to receive treatment. 
Each trip to Ceiba, Puerto Rico, for the can-
cer patient is an additional out-of-pocket ex-
pense ranging from $120 to $200. 
(4) The United States Military maintained 
a presence on the eastern and western por-
tions of Vieques for close to 60 years, and 
used parts of the island as a training range 
during those years, dropping over 80 million 
tons of ordnance and other weaponry avail-
able to the United States military since 
World War II.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7812 
November 4, 2021 
(5) The unintended, unknown, and unavoid-
able consequences of these exercises were to 
expose Americans living on the islands to 
the residue of that weaponry which includes 
heavy metals and many other chemicals now 
known to harm human health. 
(6) According to Government and inde-
pendent 
documentation, 
the 
island 
of 
Vieques has high levels of heavy metals and 
has been exposed to chemical weapons and 
toxic chemicals. Since the military activity 
in Vieques, island residents have suffered 
from the health impacts from long-term ex-
posure to environmental contamination as a 
result of 62 years of military operations, and 
have experienced higher rates of certain dis-
eases among residents, including cancer, cir-
rhosis, hypertension, diabetes, heavy metal 
diseases, along with many unnamed and 
uncategorized illnesses. These toxic residues 
have caused the American residents of 
Vieques to develop illnesses due to ongoing 
exposure. 
(7) In 2017, Vieques was hit by Hurricane 
Maria, an unusually destructive storm that 
devastated Puerto Rico and intensified the 
existing humanitarian crisis on the island by 
destroying existing medical facilities. 
(8) The medical systems in place prior to 
Hurricane Maria were unable to properly 
handle the health crisis that existed due to 
the toxic residue left on the island by the 
military’s activities. 
(9) After Maria, the medical facility was 
closed due to damage and continues to be un-
able to perform even the few basic services 
that it did provide. Vieques needs a medical 
facility that can treat and address the crit-
ical and urgent need to get life-saving med-
ical services to its residents. Due to legal re-
strictions, the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency (in this title referred to as 
‘‘FEMA’’) is unable to provide a hospital 
where its capabilities exceed the abilities of 
the facility that existed prior to Maria; 
therefore Vieques needs assistance to build a 
facility to manage the vast health needs of 
its residents. 
(10) Every American has benefitted from 
the sacrifices of those Americans who have 
lived and are living on Vieques and it is our 
intent to acknowledge that sacrifice and to 
treat those Americans with the same respect 
and 
appreciation 
that 
other 
Americans 
enjoy. 
(11) In 2012, the residents of Vieques were 
denied the ability to address their needs in 
Court due to sovereign immunity, Sa´nchez v. 
United 
States, 
No. 
3:09–cv–01260–DRD 
(D.P.R.). However, the United States Court 
of Appeals for the First Circuit referred the 
issue to Congress and urged it to address the 
humanitarian crisis. This bill attempts to 
satisfy that request such that Americans liv-
ing on Vieques have a remedy for the suf-
fering they have endured.

THE UNITED STATES FOR CERTAIN 
RESIDENTS

SEC. 1054. COMBATING TRAFFICKING OF CUBAN 
DOCTORS. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Combating Trafficking of 
Cuban Doctors Act of 2021’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Department of State’s 2020 Traf-
ficking in Persons report ranked Cuba in 
Tier 3 and included evidence regarding 
Cuba’s foreign medical missions and the Gov-
ernment of Cuba’s longstanding failure to 
criminalize most forms of forced labor, spe-
cifically noting allegations that Cuban au-
thorities coerced participants to remain in 
foreign medical missions by— 
(A) ‘‘withholding their passports and med-
ical credentials’’; 
(B) ‘‘using ‘minders’ to conduct surveil-
lance of participants outside of work’’; 
(C) ‘‘restricting their movement’’; 
(D) ‘‘retaliat[ing] against their family 
members in Cuba if participants leave the 
program’’; or 
(E) ‘‘impos[ing] criminal penalties, exile, 
and family separation if participants do not 
return to Cuba as directed by government 
supervisors’’. 
(2) Since the outbreak of the COVID–19 
pandemic in early 2020, the Government of 
Cuba has deployed approximately 1,500 med-
ical personnel to at least 20 countries. 
(3) The United Nations Special Rapporteur 
on contemporary forms of slavery and the 
United Nations Special Rapporteur on traf-
ficking in persons, especially women and 
children, in their letter to the Government 
of Cuba on November 6, 2019— 
(A) noted reports of coercive labor prac-
tices through the Government of Cuba’s for-
eign medical missions; 
(B) highlighted reports by Cuban medical 
professionals that they received regular 
threats from Cuban officials while working 
overseas, including sexual harassment of 
women; and 
(C) expressed concern that the practices re-
ferred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) con-
stitute slavery and trafficking in persons. 
(4) In 2019, the Government of Cuba main-
tained an estimated 34,000 to 50,000 medical 
personnel in more than 60 countries under 
conditions that represent forced labor, ac-
cording to the Department of State. 
(5) The Government of Cuba realized prof-
its in excess of $6,300,000,000 during 2018 from 
exporting the services of Cuban profes-
sionals, of which foreign medical missions 
represent the majority of the services and in-
come. 
(6) The term ‘‘severe forms of trafficking in 
persons’’ is defined under section 103(11)(B) of 
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 
2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(11)(B)) as ‘‘the recruit-
ment, harboring, transportation, provision, 
or obtaining of a person for labor or services, 
through the use of force, fraud, or coercion 
for the purpose of subjection to involuntary 
servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slav-
ery’’. 
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Government of Cuba subjects Cuban 
doctors and other medical professionals to 
state-sponsored human trafficking; and 
(2) the Government of Cuba should imme-
diately and transparently respond to re-
quests for information from the United Na-
tions Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery and the United Nations Spe-
cial Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, es-
pecially women and children. 
(d) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act and annually thereafter until the date 
specified in subsection (f), the Secretary of 
State shall submit a report to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate 
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives that— 
(1) identifies the countries that are hosting 
Cuban medical personnel who are partici-
pating in foreign medical missions for the 
Government of Cuba; 
(2) to the extent feasible, includes an esti-
mate of— 
(A) the number of Cuban medical personnel 
in each country; and 
(B) the value of the financial arrangement 
between the Government of Cuba and the 
host country government; 
(3) describes the conditions in each country 
under which Cuban medical personnel live 
and work; and 
(4) describes the role of any international 
organization in each country hosting Cuban 
medical personnel. 
(e) 
DETERMINATION
ON
HUMAN
TRAF-
FICKING.—In each report submitted pursuant 
to subsection (d), the Secretary of State 
shall determine whether— 
(1) the Cuban medical personnel in each 
country identified in the report are subjected 
to conditions that qualify as severe forms of 
trafficking in persons (as defined in section 
103(11) of the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(11))); and 
(2) Cuba’s foreign medical missions pro-
gram constitutes proof of failure to make 
significant efforts to bring the Government 
of Cuba into compliance with the minimum 
standards for the elimination of trafficking 
in persons (as determined under section 108 
of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 
2000 (22 U.S.C. 7106)). 
(f) SUNSET.—The Secretary of State is not 
required to submit the report otherwise re-
quired under subsection (d) after the date on 
which the Secretary submits a second con-
secutive annual report under such paragraph 
that includes a determination under sub-
section (e) that Cuban medical personnel are 
no longer subjected to trafficking in persons.

lowing: 
(1) Taiwan is a free and prosperous democ-
racy of nearly 24,000,000 people and is an im-
portant contributor to peace and stability 
around the world. 
(2) Section 2(b) of the Taiwan Relations 
Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301(b)) states 
that it is the policy of the United States— 
(A) ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, 
close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and

well as the people on the China mainland and

economic interests of the United States, and

decision to establish diplomatic relations 
with the People’s Republic of China rests 
upon the expectation that the future of Tai-
wan will be determined by peaceful means’’;

the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, 
a threat to the peace and security of the 
Western Pacific area and of grave concern to 
the United States’’; 
(E) ‘‘to provide Taiwan with arms of a de-
fensive character’’; and 
(F) ‘‘to maintain the capacity of the 
United States to resist any resort to force or 
other forms of coercion that would jeop-
ardize the security, or the social or economic 
system, of the people on Taiwan’’.

Ing-wen as President of Taiwan in 2016, the

matically increased the capability of its 
military forces since 1979; 
(3) the People’s Republic of China has in 
recent years increased the use of its military 
forces to harass and provoke Taiwan with 
the threat of overwhelming force; and 
(4) it is the policy of the United States to 
consider any effort to determine the future 
of Taiwan by anything other than peaceful 
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, 
a threat to the peace and security of the 
Western Pacific area, and of grave concern to 
the United States. 
SEC. 1293. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED 
STATES ARMED FORCES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The President is author-
ized to use the Armed Forces of the United 
States and take such other measures as the

DIVISION E—SECURING AMERICA’S 
FUTURE 
SEC. 4001. SHORT TITLE. 
This division may be cited as the ‘‘Secur-
ing America’s Future Act’’. 
TITLE I—ENSURING DOMESTIC 
MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES 
Subtitle A—Build America, Buy America 
SEC. 4101. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Build 
America, Buy America Act’’. 
PART I—BUY AMERICA SOURCING 
REQUIREMENTS 
SEC. 4111. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the United States must make signifi-
cant investments to install, upgrade, or re-
place the public works infrastructure of the 
United States; 
(2) with respect to investments in the in-
frastructure of the United States, taxpayers 
expect that their public works infrastructure 
will be produced in the United States by 
American workers; 
(3) United States taxpayer dollars invested 
in public infrastructure should not be used 
to reward companies that have moved their 
operations, investment dollars, and jobs to 
foreign countries or foreign factories, par-
ticularly those that do not share or openly 
flout the commitments of the United States 
to environmental, worker, and workplace 
safety protections; 
(4) in procuring materials for public works 
projects, entities using taxpayer-financed 
Federal assistance should give a common-
sense procurement preference for the mate-
rials and products produced by companies 
and workers in the United States in accord-
ance with the high ideals embodied in the en-
vironmental, worker, workplace safety, and 
other regulatory requirements of the United 
States; 
(5) common construction materials used in 
public works infrastructure projects, includ-
ing steel, iron, manufactured products, non- 
ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based 
products (including polyvinylchloride, com-
posite building materials, and polymers used 
in fiber optic cables), concrete and other ag-
gregates, glass (including optic glass), lum-
ber, and drywall are not adequately covered 
by a domestic content procurement pref-
erence, thus limiting the impact of taxpayer 
purchases to enhance supply chains in the 
United States; 
(6) the benefits of domestic content pro-
curement preferences extend beyond eco-
nomics; 
(7) by incentivizing domestic manufac-
turing, domestic content procurement pref-
erences reinvest tax dollars in companies 
and processes using the highest labor and en-
vironmental standards in the world; 
(8) strong domestic content procurement 
preference policies act to prevent shifts in 
production to countries that rely on produc-
tion practices that are significantly less en-
ergy efficient and far more polluting than 
those in the United States; 
(9) for over 75 years, Buy America and 
other domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws have been part of the United 
States procurement policy, ensuring that the 
United States can build and rebuild the in-
frastructure of the United States with high- 
quality American-made materials; 
(10) before the date of enactment of this 
Act, a domestic content procurement pref-
erence requirement may not apply, may 
apply only to a narrow scope of products and 
materials, or may be limited by waiver with 
respect to many infrastructure programs, 
which necessitates a review of such pro-
grams, including programs for roads, high-
ways, and bridges, public transportation, 
dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime fa-
cilities, intercity passenger and freight rail-
roads, freight and intermodal facilities, air-
ports, water systems, including drinking 
water and wastewater systems, electrical 
transmission facilities and systems, utili-
ties, broadband infrastructure, and buildings 
and real property; 
(11) Buy America laws create demand for 
domestically produced goods, helping to sus-
tain and grow domestic manufacturing and 
the millions of jobs domestic manufacturing 
supports throughout product supply chains; 
(12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
domestic content procurement preference 
policies apply to all Federal Government 
procurement and to various Federal-aid in-
frastructure programs; 
(13) a robust domestic manufacturing sec-
tor is a vital component of the national secu-
rity of the United States; 
(14) as more manufacturing operations of 
the United States have moved offshore, the 
strength and readiness of the defense indus-
trial base of the United States has been di-
minished; and 
(15) domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws— 
(A) are fully consistent with the inter-
national obligations of the United States; 
and 
(B) together with the government procure-
ments to which the laws apply, are impor-
tant levers for ensuring that United States 
manufacturers can access the government 
procurement markets of the trading partners 
of the United States.

clude, at a minimum, the following: 
(1) Guidelines for Federal agencies to de-
termine, for the purposes of applying sec-
tions 8302(a) and 8303(b)(3) of title 41, United 
States Code, the circumstances under which 
the acquisition of articles, materials, or sup-
plies mined, produced, or manufactured in 
the United States is inconsistent with the 
public interest. 
(2) Guidelines to ensure Federal agencies 
base determinations of non-availability on 
appropriate considerations, including antici-
pated project delays and lack of substitut-
able articles, materials, and supplies mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United 
States, when making determinations of non- 
availability under section 8302(a)(1) of title 
41, United States Code. 
(3)(A) Uniform procedures for each Federal 
agency to make publicly available, in an eas-
ily identifiable location on the website of the

cumstances in which the head of the agency 
may waive the requirements of the Buy

cient detail to explain the basis for the waiv-
er.

paragraph shall ensure that the head of an 
agency, in consultation with the head of the 
Made in America Office established under 
section 4123(a), may limit the publication of 
classified information, trade secrets, or 
other information that could damage the 
United States. 
(4) Guidelines for Federal agencies to en-
sure that a project is not disaggregated for 
purposes of avoiding the applicability of the 
requirements under the Buy American Act. 
(5) An increase to the price preferences for 
domestic end products and domestic con-
struction materials. 
(6) Amending the definitions of ‘‘domestic 
end product’’ and ‘‘domestic construction 
material’’ to ensure that iron and steel prod-
ucts are, to the greatest extent possible, 
made with domestic components. 
(b) GUIDELINES RELATING TO WAIVERS.— 
(1) INCONSISTENCY WITH PUBLIC INTEREST.— 
(A) IN
GENERAL.—With respect to the 
guidelines developed under subsection (a)(1), 
the Administrator shall seek to minimize 
waivers related to contract awards that— 
(i) result in a decrease in employment in 
the United States, including employment 
among entities that manufacture the arti-
cles, materials, or supplies; or 
(ii) result in awarding a contract that 
would decrease domestic employment. 
(B) COVERED EMPLOYMENT.—For purposes of 
subparagraph (A), employment refers to posi-
tions directly involved in the manufacture of 
articles, materials, or supplies, and does not 
include positions related to management, re-
search and development, or engineering and 
design. 
(2) ASSESSMENT ON USE OF DUMPED OR SUB-
SIDIZED FOREIGN PRODUCTS.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—To the extent otherwise 
permitted by law, before granting a waiver 
in the public interest to the guidelines devel-
oped under subsection (a)(1) with respect to a 
product sourced from a foreign country, a 
Federal agency shall assess whether a sig-
nificant portion of the cost advantage of the 
product is the result of the use of dumped 
steel, iron, or manufactured goods or the use 
of injuriously subsidized steel, iron, or man-
ufactured goods. 
(B) CONSULTATION.—The Federal agency 
conducting the assessment under subpara-
graph (A) shall consult with the Inter-
national Trade Administration in making 
the assessment if the agency considers such 
consultation to be helpful. 
(C) USE OF FINDINGS.—The Federal agency 
conducting the assessment under subpara-
graph (A) shall integrate any findings from 
the assessment into its waiver determina-
tion. 
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INCREASING DO-
MESTIC
CONTENT
REQUIREMENTS.—It is the 
sense of Congress that the Federal Acquisi-
tion Regulatory Council should amend the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation to increase 
the domestic content requirements for do-
mestic end products and domestic construc-
tion material to 75 percent, or, in the event 
of no qualifying offers, 60 percent. 
(d) DEFINITION OF END PRODUCT MANUFAC-
TURED
IN
THE
UNITED

Subtitle C—Make PPE in America 
SEC. 4151. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Make 
PPE in America Act’’. 
SEC. 4152. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed 
the vulnerability of the United States supply 
chains for, and lack of domestic production 
of, personal protective equipment (PPE). 
(2) The United States requires a robust, se-
cure, and wholly domestic PPE supply chain 
to safeguard public health and national secu-
rity. 
(3) Issuing a strategy that provides the 
government’s anticipated needs over the 
next three years will enable suppliers to as-
sess what changes, if any, are needed in their 
manufacturing capacity to meet expected de-
mands. 
(4) In order to foster a domestic PPE sup-
ply chain, United States industry needs a 
strong and consistent demand signal from 
the Federal Government providing the nec-
essary certainty to expand production capac-
ity investment in the United States. 
(5) In order to effectively incentivize in-
vestment in the United States and the re- 
shoring of manufacturing, long-term con-
tracts must be no shorter than three years in 
duration. 
(6) To accomplish this aim, the United 
States should seek to ensure compliance 
with its international obligations, such as 
its commitments under the World Trade Or-
ganization’s Agreement on Government Pro-
curement and its free trade agreements, in-
cluding by invoking any relevant exceptions 
to those agreements, especially those related 
to national security and public health. 
(7) The United States needs a long-term in-
vestment strategy for the domestic produc-
tion of PPE items critical to the United 
States national response to a public health 
crisis, including the COVID–19 pandemic.

It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to strengthen the prohibition against 
the importation of goods made with forced 
labor, including by ensuring that the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
does not undermine the effective enforce-
ment of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 
(19 U.S.C. 1307), which prohibits the importa-
tion of all ‘‘goods, wares, articles, and mer-
chandise mined, produced or manufactured 
wholly or in part in any foreign country by 
. . . forced labor’’; 
(2) to lead the international community in 
ending forced labor practices wherever such 
practices occur through all means available 
to the United States Government, including 
by stopping the importation of any goods 
made with forced labor, including those 
goods mined, produced, or manufactured 
wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region; 
(3) to actively work to prevent, publicly 
denounce, and end human trafficking, in-
cluding with respect to forced labor, whether 
sponsored by the government of a foreign 
country or not, and to restore the lives of 
those affected by human trafficking, a mod-
ern form of slavery; 
(4) to regard the prevention of atrocities as 
a priority in the national interests of the 
United States; and 
(5) to address gross violations of human 
rights in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region— 
(A) through bilateral diplomatic channels 
and multilateral institutions in which both 
the United States and the People’s Republic 
of China are members; and

tions, and import controls.

ical influence operations;

tion with the United Kingdom, Australia,

pore, and the members of the European

power’’ tactics, including the Chinese Com-

gram, which is designed to instill admiration

fectively;

lic or private organizations with a demon-

nese Communist Party that are operating in 
the United States to register through the 
Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (22 
U.S.C. 611 et seq.) or a comparable mecha-
nism; 
(9) to seek ways to increase Chinese lan-
guage proficiency among mid-career profes-
sionals that do not rely on funding linked to 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China; 
(10) to ensure that existing tools are suffi-
ciently screening for the risk of Chinese in-
fluence operations; and

ed, with the goals of—

ernment of the People’s Republic of China or

tect against the takeover of United States 
companies by Chinese state-owned or state- 
driven entities; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7906 
November 4, 2021 
(A) governments may be required to take 
appropriate extraordinary measures during 
public health emergencies to halt the spread 
of disease, including closing businesses and 
public events, limiting access to public 
spaces, and restricting the movement of peo-
ple; 
(B) 
certain 
foreign 
governments 
have 
taken measures in response to COVID–19 
that violate the human rights of their citi-
zens without clear public health justifica-
tion, oversight measures, or sunset provi-
sions; 
(C) governments using the COVID–19 pan-
demic as a pretext for repression have under-
mined democratic institutions, debilitated 
institutions for transparency and public in-
tegrity, quashed legitimate dissent, and at-
tacked journalists, civil society organiza-
tions, activists, independent voices, and vul-
nerable and marginalized populations, in-
cluding refugees and migrants, with far- 
reaching consequences that will extend be-
yond the current crisis; 
(D) foreign governments should take im-
mediate steps to release from prison all arbi-
trarily detained United States citizens and 
political prisoners who may be at increased 
risk for contracting or suffering from com-
plications from COVID–19; 
(E) COVID–19 threatens to roll back dec-
ades of progress for women and girls, dis-
proportionately affecting women economi-
cally, educationally, and with respect to 
health, while also leading to alarming rises 
in gender based violence; and 
(F) during and after the pandemic, the De-
partment of State and USAID should di-
rectly, and through nongovernmental orga-
nizations 
or 
international 
organizations, 
provide assistance and implement programs 
that support democratic institutions, civil 
society, free media, and the advancement of 
internationally recognized human rights. 
(2) FUNDING FOR CIVIL SOCIETY AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS DEFENDERS.— 
(A) PROGRAM
PRIORITIES.—Amounts made 
available for each of the fiscal years 2022

Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 and 2151–1), includ-
ing programs to support democratic institu-
tions, human rights defenders, civil society, 
and freedom of the press, should be targeted, 
to the extent feasible, toward civil society

gency government measures taken in re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic have vio-
lated 
internationally 
recognized 
human 
rights. 
(B) ELIGIBLE ORGANIZATIONS.—Civil society

partment of State and USAID that address-
es, through multilateral and bilateral diplo-
macy and foreign assistance, the persistent

(h) PUBLIC
DIPLOMACY
AND
COMBATING 
DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ABOUT 
COVID–19.— 
(1) UNITED
STATES
AGENCY
FOR
GLOBAL 
MEDIA.— 
(A) 
FINDING.—Congress 
finds 
that 
the 
United States Agency for Global Media (re-

broadcasting entities and grantees have 
proven valuable in providing timely and ac-
curate information, particularly in countries 
in which the free press is under threat.

Congress that— 
(i) accurate, investigative, and scientific 
journalism is critical for societies to effec-

Martı´ and Digital Martı´ should continue to 
broadcast programs that detect, highlight, 
and dispel disinformation. 
(E) RADIO FREE EUROPE/RADIO LIBERTY.— 
(i) FINDING.—Congress finds that Radio 
Free Europe/Radio Liberty (referred to in 
this section as ‘‘RFE/RL’’) operate in media 
markets in which authoritarian state and 
nonstate actors, including Russia, heavily 
invest in misinformation and disinformation 
campaigns designed to promote confusion 
and mistrust. 
(ii) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that RFE/RL should— 
(I) increase investigative reporting regard-
ing the impacts of COVID–19, the political 
and social responses governments are taking 
in response to COVID–19, and the lasting im-
pacts such actions will have on key political 
freedoms; and 
(II) expand its ‘‘digital first’’ strategy. 
(F) RADIO FREE ASIA.— 
(i) FINDING.—Congress finds that Radio

dominated by powerful state-run media that 
have invested heavily in media distortion 
and disinformation, including about COVID– 
19. 
(ii) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that RFA should— 
(I) commission technical experts to bolster 
efforts to counter social media tools, includ-
ing bots used by some countries to promote 
misinformation;

coverage to expose China’s media manipula-
tion techniques; and

help counter China’s propaganda directed to-
ward English-speaking audiences.

MIDDLE
EAST

NET-
WORKS.—

dle East Broadcasting Networks operate 
largely in closed media markets in which 
malign state and nonstate actors remain ac-
tive.

Congress that the Middle East Broadcasting 
Networks should— 
(I) continue plans to expand an investiga-
tive news unit; and 
(II) work to ensure that reporting con-
tinues amidst operational challenges on the 
ground. 
(H) OPEN TECHNOLOGY FUND.— 
(i) FINDING.—Congress finds that the Open 
Technology Fund works to advance internet 
freedom in repressive environments by sup-
porting technologies that— 
(I) provide secure and uncensored access to 
USAGM’s content and the broader internet; 
and 
(II) counter attempts by authoritarian gov-
ernments to control the internet and restrict 
freedom online. 
(ii) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Open Technology Fund 
should—

respond to increasingly aggressive and so-
phisticated 
censorship 
and 
surveillance 
threats and provide more comprehensive and 
tailored support to USAGM’s networks; and 
(II) provide direct assistance to USAGM’s 
networks to improve the digital security of 
reporting operations and journalists. 
(2) DEPARTMENT
OF
STATE
PUBLIC
DIPLO-
MACY PROGRAMS.— 
(A) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(i) The Department of State’s public diplo-
macy programs build global networks that 
can address shared challenges, such as the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including through ex-
changes of researchers, public health ex-
perts, and scientists. 
(ii) The programs referred to in clause (i) 
play a critical role in creating open and re-
silient information environments where de-
mocracies can thrive, as articulated in the 
2020 Public Diplomacy Strategic Plan, in-
cluding by— 
(I) improving media quality with jour-
nalist training and reporting tours; 
(II) conducting media literacy programs; 
and 
(III) supporting media access activities. 
(iii) The International Visitor Leadership 
Program and Digital Communications Net-
work engaged journalists around the world 
to combat COVID–19 disinformation, pro-
mote unbiased reporting, and strengthen 
media literacy.

1 visas from 130 countries— 
(I) are engaged in residency or fellowship 
training at approximately 750 hospitals 
throughout the United States, the majority

and in United States university laboratories 
researching ways to detect and treat the 
virus. 
(B) VISA PROCESSING BRIEFING.—Not later 
than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Assistant Secretary for Con-
sular Affairs shall brief the appropriate con-
gressional committees by providing— 
(i) a timeline for increasing visa processing 
capacities at embassies around the world, 
notably where there are— 
(I) many American citizens, including dual 
nationals; and 
(II) many visa applicants for educational 
and cultural exchange programs that pro-
mote United States foreign policy objectives 
and economic stability to small businesses, 
universities, and communities across the 
United States; 
(ii) a detailed plan for using existing au-
thorities to waive or provide other alter-
natives to in-person appointments and inter-
views; 
(iii) an assessment of whether additional 
authorities and resources are required for 
the use of videoconference appointments and 
interviews as an alternative to in-person ap-
pointments and interviews; and 
(iv) a detailed plan for using existing au-
thorities to rapidly cross-train and surge 
temporary personnel to support consular 
services at embassies and consulates of the 
United States around the world, and an as-
sessment of whether additional authorities 
and resources are required. 
(C) GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER.— 
(i) FINDING.—Congress finds that since the 
beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, publi-
cations, websites, and platforms associated 
with China, Russia, and Iran have sponsored 
disinformation campaigns related to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including falsely blam-
ing the United States for the disease. 
(ii) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Global Engagement Center 
should continue its efforts to expose and 
counter 
state 
and 
non-state-sponsored 
disinformation related to COVID–19, the ori-
gins of COVID–19, and COVID–19 vaccina-
tions. 
(i) FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS RE-
GARDING THE UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) The COVID–19 pandemic is causing a 
global economic recession, as evidenced by 
the global economic indicators described in 
subparagraphs (B) through (D). 
(B) The United Nations Conference on 
Trade and Development determined that the 
COVID–19 pandemic pushed the global econ-
omy into recession in 2020 on a scale that has 
not been witnessed since the 1930s. 
(C) Developed countries are expected to ex-
perience a relatively more significant re-
bound in gross domestic product growth dur-
ing 2021 than is expected to be experienced in 
developing countries, leading to concerns 
about a further expansion in the gap between 
rich and poor countries, particularly if this 
trend continues into 2022. 
(D) Global markets have suffered losses 
ranging between 5 percent and over 10 per-
cent since the beginning of the pandemic. 
While markets are recovering in 2021, global 
job losses and unemployment rates remain 
high, with— 
(i) approximately 33,000,000 labor hours lost 
globally (13 per cent of the total hours lost) 
due to outright unemployment; and 
(ii) an estimated additional 81,000,000 labor 
hours lost due to inactivity or underemploy-
ment. 
(E) Given the prolonged nature of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, African finance min-
isters have requested continued efforts to 
provide— 
(i) additional liquidity; 
(ii) better market access; 
(iii) more concessional resources; and 
(iv) an extension in the Debt Service Sus-
pension Initiative established by the Group 
of 20. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) even when markets begin to recover in 
the future, it is likely that access to capital 
will be especially challenging for developing 
countries, which still will be struggling with 
the containment of, and recovery from, the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
(B) economic uncertainty and the inability 
of individuals and households to generate in-
come are major drivers of political insta-
bility and social discord, which create condi-
tions for insecurity; 
(C) it is in the security and economic inter-
ests of the United States to assist in the eco-
nomic recovery of developing countries that 
are made more vulnerable and unstable from 
the public health and economic impacts of 
the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(D) United States foreign assistance and 
development 
finance 
institutions 
should 
seek to blunt the impacts of a COVID–19 re-
lated economic recession by supporting in-
vestments in sectors critical to maintaining 
economic stability and resilience in low and 
middle income countries; 
(E) the need for the United States Inter-
national Development Finance Corporation’s 
support for advancing development outcomes 
in less developed countries, as mandated by 
the Better Utilization of Investments Lead-
ing to Development Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9601 
et seq.), is critical to ensuring lasting and re-
silient economic growth in light of the 
COVID–19 pandemic’s exacerbation of eco-
nomic hardships and challenges; 
(F) The United States International Devel-
opment Finance Corporation should adjust 
its view of risk versus return by taking 
smart risks that may produce a lower rate of 
financial return, but produce significant de-
velopment outcomes in responding to the 
economic effects of COVID–19; 
(G) to mitigate the economic impacts of 
the COVID–19 recession, the United States 
International Development Finance Corpora-
tion should use its resources and authorities, 
among other things— 
(i) to ensure loan support for small- and 
medium-sized enterprises; 
(ii) to offer local currency loans to bor-
rowers for working capital needs; 
(iii) to create dedicated financing opportu-
nities for new ‘‘customers’’ that are experi-
encing financial hardship due to the COVID– 
19 pandemic; and 
(iv) to work with other development fi-
nance institutions to create co-financing fa-
cilities to support customers experiencing 
hardship due to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
(j) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTER-
NATIONAL COOPERATION TO PREVENT AND RE-
SPOND TO FUTURE PANDEMICS.—It is the sense 
of Congress that— 
(1) global pandemic preparedness and re-
sponse requires international and regional 
cooperation and action; 
(2) the United States should lead efforts in 
multilateral fora, such as the Group of 7, the 
Group of 20, and the United Nations, by col-
laborating and cooperating with other coun-
tries and international and regional organi-
zations, including the World Health Organi-
zation and other key stakeholders, to imple-
ment international strategies, tools, and 
agreements to better prevent, detect, and re-
spond to future infectious disease threats be-
fore they become pandemics; and 
(3) the United States should enhance and 
expand 
coordination 
and 
collaboration

the United States to support the growth of 
healthier, more stable societies, while ad-
vancing the global health security interests 
of the United States by working with key 
stakeholders— 
(1) in developing countries that are highly 
vulnerable to the emergence, reemergence, 
and spread of infectious diseases with pan-
demic potential, including disease outbreaks 
resulting from natural and manmade disas-
ters, human displacement, loss of natural 
habitat, poor access to water, sanitation,

and financing tools are effectively designed, 
objectively informed, strategically targeted, 
carefully coordinated, reasonably adapted, 
and rigorously monitored and evaluated in a 
manner that advances the policy objectives 
under this subsection. 
(f) STRENGTHENING HEALTH SYSTEMS.— 
(1) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States to ensure that bi-
lateral global health assistance programs are 
effectively managed and coordinated to con-
tribute to the strengthening of health sys-
tems in each country in which such pro-
grams are carried out, as necessary and ap-
propriate for the purposes of achieving im-
proved health outcomes. 
(2) COORDINATION.—The Administrator of 
USAID shall work with the Global Malaria 
Coordinator and the United States Global 
AIDS Coordinator and Special Representa-
tive for Global Health Diplomacy at the De-
partment of State, and, as appropriate, the

tion in countries with global health pro-
grams and activities undertaken by USAID 
pursuant to the United States Leadership 
Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Ma-
laria Act of 2003 (Public Law 108–25) and 
other relevant statutes to ensure that such 
activities 
contribute 
to 
health 
systems 
strengthening. 
(3) PILOT PROGRAM .— 
(A) IN
GENERAL.—The Administrator of 
USAID should identify not fewer than 5 
countries in which the United States has sig-
nificant bilateral investments in global 
health to develop an integrated approach to-
ward health systems strengthening that 
takes advantage of all sources of funding for 
global health in such country, with the aim 
of establishing an enduring model for coordi-
nating health systems strengthening activi-
ties, including improving pandemic pre-
paredness in additional countries in the fu-
ture. 
(B) ASSESSMENT.—In each of the countries 
selected under subparagraph (A), USAID mis-
sions, in consultation with USAID’s Office of 
Health Systems, should conduct an assess-
ment that— 
(i) takes a comprehensive view of the con-
straints in the country’s health system that 
prevent the achievement of desired outcomes 
of 
United 
States 
Government-supported 
health programs; 
(ii) identifies the best opportunities for im-
proving health systems to achieve improved 
outcomes, including obstacles to health serv-
ice delivery;

other donors in the health sector with a 
focus 
on 
investment 
in 
health 
system 
strengthening; and 
(iv) develops, based on the results of the 
assessment described in clause (i), and imple-
ments a new or revised 5-year strategy for 
United States assistance to strengthen the 
country’s health system that— 
(I) provides a framework for implementing 
such strategy; 
(II) identifies key areas for investments to 
strengthen the health system in alignment 
with other donors and achieve health out-
comes beyond a single sector; 
(III) specifies the anticipated role of health 
programs undertaken by each of the relevant 
Federal departments and agencies operating 
in the country in implementing such strat-
egy; 
(IV) includes clear goals, benchmarks, out-
puts, desired outcomes, a means of meas-
uring progress and a cost analysis; and 
(V) requires reporting by each Federal de-
partment and agency regarding their partici-
pation and contribution, including in the 
PEPFAR Annual Report to Congress. 
(C) STRATEGIES
TO
STRENGTHEN
HEALTH 
SYSTEMS.—USAID 
missions 
in 
countries 
identified pursuant subparagraph (A) should 
develop a strategy to strengthen health sys-
tems based on the assessment developed pur-
suant to subparagraph (B) that— 
(i) ensures complementarity with prior-
ities identified under any other action plan 
focused on strengthening a country’s health 
system, such as the World Health Organiza-
tion’s Joint External Evaluation and Na-
tional Action Plans for Health Security; 
(ii) identifies bureaucratic barriers and in-
efficiencies, including poor linkages between 
government ministries and between min-
istries and donor agencies and the extent of 
any corruption, and identify actions to over-
come such barriers; 
(iii) identifies potential obstacles to the 
implementation of the strategy, such as 
issues relating to lack of political will, poor 
governance of an effective health system at 
all levels of the country’s public health sys-
tems, especially with respect to governing 
bodies and councils at the provincial, dis-
trict, and community levels, and the exclu-
sion of women, minorities, other underserved 
groups, and frontline health workers in deci-
sion making; 
(iv) includes proposals for mobilizing suffi-
cient and durable financing for health sys-
tems; 
(v) identifies barriers to building and re-
taining an effective frontline health work-
force with key global health security capac-
ities, informed by the International Health 
Regulations (2005), including— 
(I) strengthened data collection and anal-
ysis; 
(II) data driven decision making capacity;

SEC. 1253. AUSTRALIA-UNITED STATES LEGISLA-
TIVE EXCHANGE PROGRAM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China con-
tinues to assert its regional ambitions in the 
Indo-Pacific region. 
(2) The ideological aims driving the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s foreign policy runs 
counter to aims of democracies such as the 
United States and its allies. 
(3) Australia has been one of the United 
State’s staunchest allies for well over 100 
years. This ‘‘Mateship’’ began with the visit 
of the American Great White Fleet to Syd-
ney Harbor in 1908. The budding relationship 
was soon sealed through American and Aus-
tralian troops fighting and dying together in 
the World War I. 
(4) Since the World War I, Australians and 
Americans— 
(A) have supported each other in every 
major military conflict in which the United 
States was involved; and 
(B) have mutually supported each another 
in intelligence-sharing.

Congress that—

November 4, 2021 
(1) the United States must continue to 
build and maintain strong relationships with 
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region 
to successfully compete with the People’s 
Republic of China; 
(2) the Australia-United States relation-
ship will continue to be vital throughout the 
21st century and beyond to compete with and 
deter China; 
(3) as the Australia-United States alliance 
evolves, it is vital to ensure that emerging 
leaders in both countries develop a deep un-
derstanding of their ally’s view of the world; 
and 
(4) exchange programs between key legisla-
tive national security staff from Congress 
and Australian Parliament will further bind 
our nations together.

specially 
designed 
courses covering the politics and foreign pol-
icy issues in such country with the intent to 
foster a deeper understanding of the political 
environment in which their counterparts op-
erate.

exchanges and lasting relationships between 
policymakers and leaders in both countries. 
SA 4399. Mr. COTTON submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 3867 submitted by Mr. 
REED and intended to be proposed to 
the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize appro-
priations for fiscal year 2022 for mili-
tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of title XIV, add the following:

SEC. 1433. REPORT ON ESTABLISHMENT OF STRA-
TEGIC DEFENSE MINERAL AND DE-
FENSE 
MINERAL 
PRODUCTS 
RE-
SERVE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that the stor-
age of substantial quantities of defense min-
erals and defense mineral products will— 
(1) diminish the vulnerability of the United 
States to the effects of a severe supply chain 
interruption; and 
(2) provide limited protection from the 
short-term consequences of an interruption 
in supplies of defense mineral products. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that, in procuring defense minerals 
and defense mineral products, the Secretary 
of Defense should prioritize procurement of 
defense minerals and defense mineral prod-
ucts from sources in the United States, in-
cluding that are mined, produced, separated, 
and manufactured within the United States. 
(c) REPORT REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 270 days

proposed to amendment SA 3867 sub-
mitted by Mr. REED and intended to be 
proposed to the bill H.R. 4350, to au-
thorize appropriations for fiscal year 
2022 for military activities of the De-
partment of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of 
the Department of Energy, to prescribe 
military personnel strengths for such 
fiscal year, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
At the end of subtitle G of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1283. TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION AC-
COUNTABILITY AND PREVENTION. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Transnational Repression Ac-
countability and Prevention Act of 2021’’ or 
as the ‘‘TRAP Act of 2021’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The International Criminal Police Or-
ganization (INTERPOL) works to prevent 
and fight crime through enhanced coopera-
tion and innovation on police and security 
matters, including kleptocracy, counterter-
rorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and 
transnational organized crime. 
(2) United States membership and partici-
pation in INTERPOL advances the national 
security and law enforcement interests of 
the United States related to combating 
kleptocracy, 
terrorism, 
cybercrime, 
nar-
cotics, and transnational organized crime. 
(3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that the organization aims ‘‘[to] en-
sure and promote the widest possible mutual 
assistance between all criminal police au-
thorities . . . in the spirit of the ‘Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights’ ’’. 
(4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that ‘‘[i]t is strictly forbidden for the 
Organization to undertake any intervention 
or activities of a political, military, reli-
gious or racial character’’. 
(5) These principles provide INTERPOL 
with a foundation based on respect for 
human rights and avoidance of politically 
motivated actions by the organization and 
its members. 
(6) According to the Justice Manual of the 
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘[i]n 
the United States, national law prohibits the 
arrest of the subject of a Red Notice issued 
by another INTERPOL member country, 
based upon the notice alone’’. 
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that some INTERPOL member 
countries 
have 
repeatedly 
misused 
INTERPOL’s databases and processes, in-
cluding Notice and Diffusion mechanisms, 
for activities of an overtly political or other 
unlawful character and in violation of inter-
national human rights standards, including 
making requests to harass or persecute polit-
ical opponents, human rights defenders, or 
journalists. 
(d) SUPPORT FOR INTERPOL INSTITUTIONAL 
REFORMS.—The Attorney General and the 
Secretary of State shall— 
(1) use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
United 
States, 
as 
appropriate, 
within 
INTERPOL’s General Assembly and Execu-
tive Committee to promote reforms aimed at 
improving the transparency of INTERPOL 
and ensuring its operation consistent with 
its Constitution, particularly articles 2 and 
3, and Rules on the Processing of Data, in-
cluding— 
(A) supporting INTERPOL’s reforms en-
hancing the screening process for Notices, 
Diffusions, and other INTERPOL commu-
nications 
to 
ensure 
they 
comply 
with 
INTERPOL’s Constitution and Rules on the 
Processing of Data (RPD); 
(B) 
supporting 
and 
strengthening 
INTERPOL’s coordination with the Commis-
sion for Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) 
in cases in which INTERPOL or the CCF has 
determined that a member country issued a 
Notice, Diffusion, or other INTERPOL com-
munication against an individual in viola-
tion of articles 2 or 3 of the INTERPOL Con-
stitution, or the RPD, to prohibit such mem-
ber country from seeking the publication or 
issuance of any subsequent Notices, Diffu-
sions, or other INTERPOL communication 
against the same individual based on the 
same set of claims or facts; 
(C) increasing, to the extent practicable, 
dedicated funding to the CCF and the No-
tices and Diffusions Task Force in order to 
further expand operations related to the re-
view of requests for red notices and red diffu-
sions; 
(D) supporting candidates for positions 
within INTERPOL’s structures, including 
the Presidency, Executive Committee, Gen-
eral Secretariat, and CCF who have dem-
onstrated experience relating to and respect 
for the rule of law; 
(E) seeking to require INTERPOL in its an-
nual report to provide a detailed account, 
disaggregated by member country or entity 
of— 
(i) 
the 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it received; 
(ii) 
the 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it rejected; 
(iii) the category of violation identified in 
each instance of a rejected Notice; 
(iv) the number of Diffusions that it can-
celled without reference to decisions by the 
CCF; and 
(v) the sources of all INTERPOL income 
during the reporting period; and 
(F) supporting greater transparency by the 
CCF in its annual report by providing a de-
tailed account, disaggregated by country, 
of— 
(i) the number of admissible requests for 
correction or deletion of data received by the 
CCF regarding issued Notices, Diffusions, 
and other INTERPOL communications; and 
(ii) the category of violation alleged in 
each such complaint; 
(2) inform the INTERPOL General Secre-
tariat about incidents in which member 
countries abuse INTERPOL communications 
for politically motivated or other unlawful 
purposes so that, as appropriate, action can 
be taken by INTERPOL; and 
(3) request to censure member countries 
that 
repeatedly 
abuse 
and 
misuse 
INTERPOL’s red notice and red diffusion 
mechanisms, including restricting the access 
of those countries to INTERPOL’s data and 
information systems.

country has abused or misused the red notice 
and red diffusion mechanisms for overtly po-
litical purposes. 
(E) A description of any incidents in which

tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—Ukraine Security Partnership 
Act of 2021 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Ukraine 
Security Partnership Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Throughout its history, Ukraine has ex-
perienced several long periods of occupation. 
(2) Between 1919 and 1991, Ukraine was bru-
tally ruled by the Soviet Union, whose policy 
of agricultural collectivization caused the 
Holodomor of 1932–1933, a man-made famine 
that resulted in the death of at least 3,000,000 
Ukrainians by starvation. 
(3) During the Nazi occupation of Ukraine 
accompanying World War II— 
(A) approximately 3,500,000 Ukrainian civil-
ians and 3,000,000 soldiers were killed; and 
(B) approximately 1,500,000 Jews were mas-
sacred. 
(4) Ukraine declared its independence from 
Moscow in 1991, after the collapse of the So-
viet Union. 
(5) In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, the 
Russian Federation, the United States, and 
the United Kingdom pledged to ‘‘respect the 
independence and sovereignty and the exist-
ing borders of Ukraine’’ and ‘‘refrain from 
the threat or use of force against the terri-
torial integrity or political independence of 
Ukraine’’ in exchange for Ukraine’s sur-
render of its nuclear arsenal. 
(6) From November 2004 through January 
2005, thousands of Ukrainians took to the 
streets to peacefully protest electoral fraud 
and widespread corruption by the ruling elite 
in the 2004 Presidential election, successfully 
triggering a re-vote, in what became known 
as the Orange Revolution. 
(7) During Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of 
Dignity, or Euromaidan, the pro-Russian 
government of President Viktor Yanukovych 
was forced to resign after thousands of 
Ukrainians 
peacefully 
protested 
Yanukovych’s decision to reject a closer re-
lationship with the European Union and his 
continued systemic corruption, and over 100 
of those protestors were killed by violent 
government suppression. 
(8) Fearful of Ukraine’s strengthened pro- 
Western orientation after the Revolution of 
Dignity, the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration, in violation of international law and 
in contravention of its commitments in the 
Budapest Memorandum— 
(A) sent undisclosed military personnel 
into Ukraine’s Autonomous Republic of Cri-
mea in February 2014 and has illegally occu-
pied the Crimean Peninsula for the past 
seven years; 
(B) sent covert, unmarked military per-
sonnel into the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk 
and Luhansk in April 2014, instigating and 
supporting a still-ongoing conflict that has 
cost nearly 14,000 lives; and 
(C) provided the Buk missile system used 
by those Russia-led forces to shoot down Ma-
laysian Airlines Flight 17 over eastern 
Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 pas-
sengers and crew on board. 
(9) Under Russian control, Crimean au-
thorities have kidnapped, imprisoned, and 
tortured Crimean Tatars, opposition figures, 
activists, and other minority populations, 
and have persecuted religious minorities by 
pressing false charges of terrorism and 
deregistering religious centers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7926 
November 4, 2021 
(10) In September 2014, in an attempt to 
stop the fighting that the Russian Federa-
tion 
had 
initiated 
in 
eastern 
Ukraine, 
France, Germany, Ukraine, the Russian Fed-
eration, the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation (OSCE), and Russia-led forces 
from eastern Ukraine signed the Minsk Pro-
tocol. 
(11) In February 2015, after the failure of 
the initial Minsk Protocol, the Russian Fed-
eration committed to the Minsk II Agree-
ment, the roadmap for resolving the conflict 
in eastern Ukraine, signed by the Govern-
ments of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Ger-
many. 
(12) Despite these agreements, the Govern-
ment of the Russian Federation continues to 
violate Ukrainian sovereignty through— 
(A) manipulation of Ukraine’s dependence 
on Russian natural gas, including cutting off 
access in 2014, which deprived Ukraine of its 
energy supply and transit fees; 
(B) espionage and clandestine assassina-
tions on Ukrainian territory; 
(C) continuous cyber warfare against the 
Government of Ukraine and Ukrainian busi-
nesses, such as the NotPetya hack in 2017; 
and 
(D) seizure of Ukrainian property and citi-
zens, including the November 2018 seizure in 
the Kerch Strait of three Ukrainian naval 
vessels and 24 Ukrainian officers on board 
those vessels. 
(13) In July 2018, Secretary of State Mi-
chael R. Pompeo issued the Crimea Declara-
tion and reiterated in February 2020 on the 
sixth anniversary of Russia’s illegal occupa-
tion that ‘‘Crimea is Ukraine’’. 
(14) On February 26, 2021 President Joseph 
R. Biden confirmed that Crimea is Ukraine 
and the United States does not and will 
never recognize Russia’s purported annex-
ation of the peninsula. 
(15) Since April 2014, at least 4,100 Ukrain-
ian soldiers have died fighting for their coun-
try against the Russian Federation and Rus-
sia-led forces, while no less than 3,361 civil-
ians have perished as a result of that fight-
ing. 
(16) Despite Ukraine’s tumultuous history 
and neighborhood, in under 30 years it has 
risen from the collapse of the Soviet Union 
to become a developing democracy, steadily 
working to overcome its Soviet legacy of op-
pression, oligarchic control, and corruption. 
(17) Running on a strong anti-corruption 
platform, Volodymyr Zelensky won the 2019 
presidential election with 73 percent of the 
vote, and his political party, Servant of the 
People, won a parliamentary majority in the 
Ukrainian parliament. 
(18) The OSCE confirmed the 2019 elections 
were ‘‘competitive and fundamental free-
doms were generally respected’’. 
(19) In March and April 2021, the Russian 
Federation amassed over 75,000 troops on its 
border with the Eastern Ukraine and in the 
occupied territory of Crimea. 
(20) Since 2014, the Government of Ukraine 
has made difficult and substantial reforms in 
an effort to address corruption and more 
closely align with the West, such as slim-
ming and decentralizing its bureaucracy, re-
moving 
immunity 
from 
prosecution 
for 
Members of Parliament, reforming its gas, 
pension, and procurement systems, and 
working to adapt its military to the stand-
ards of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO). 
(21) Despite progress in reforming many 
areas 
of 
Ukrainian 
governance, 
serious 
issues still remain, particularly in the areas 
of corruption and rule of law. 
(22) The United States Government has 
consistently supported Ukraine’s democratic 
transition and its fight against Russia-led 
forces by assisting its governance reform ef-
forts, maintaining robust and coordinated 
sanctions against the Russian Federation 
alongside the European Union, and providing 
the Ukrainian military with training and 
equipment, including lethal defensive weap-
onry. 
(23) In addition to the United States, the 
European Union, European countries, and 
Canada have provided substantial diplo-
matic, monetary, and military support for 
Ukraine’s democratic transition and its fight 
against Russia-led forces in eastern Ukraine, 
and also have implemented and maintained 
robust sanctions regimes against the Rus-
sian Federation for its illegal occupation of 
Crimea and its active destabilization of 
Ukraine. 
(24) the Government of Ukraine has stead-
fastly supported the United States and Euro-
pean allies by deploying troops to Iraq, Af-
ghanistan, 
and 
NATO’s 
Kosovo 
Force 
(KFOR), allowing United States military 
planes to refuel on Ukrainian soil, and trad-
ing billions of dollars’ worth of goods and 
services with the United States. 
(25) NATO has recently decided to include 
Ukraine in its Enhanced Opportunities Part-
nership in recognition of Ukraine’s contribu-
tions to NATO missions and efforts to reform 
its military in line with NATO standards. 
(26) Since the Russian Federation’s 2014 in-
vasion of Ukraine, the United States Con-
gress has demonstrated its support for 
Ukraine through the passage of legislation, 
including the Support for the Sovereignty, 
Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Sta-
bility of Ukraine Act of 2014 (Public Law 113– 
95; 22 U.S.C. 8901 et seq.), the Ukraine Free-
dom Support Act (Public Law 113–272; 22 
U.S.C. 8921 et seq.), the Ukraine Security As-
sistance Initiative established under section 
1250 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92; 
129 Stat. 1068), the Countering America’s Ad-
versaries Through Sanctions Act (Public 
Law 115–44), and the Protecting Europe’s En-
ergy Security Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–92, 
title LXXV), and the United States Congress 
continues to demonstrate strong support for 
assisting Ukraine in defending itself and de-
terring Russia. 
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) Ukraine stands as a bulwark against 
the malign influence of the Russian Federa-
tion in Europe, and robust United States 
support for Ukraine is vital to United States 
national security and demonstrates the com-
mitment of the United States to upholding a 
free and open international order; 
(2) since Ukraine’s independence in 1991, 
the Government and people of Ukraine have 
made significant strides towards improved 
governance, rule of law, anti-corruption 
measures, and economic reforms; 
(3) Ukraine’s long-term viability is di-
rectly connected to its efforts to reduce cor-
ruption and build strong democratic institu-
tions that are able to defend against internal 
and external corrupt actors; 
(4) the efforts and sacrifices of Ukrainian 
citizens to determine their own fate after 
centuries of oppression, through democratic 
representation and governance reforms, is 
evidence of that country’s dedication to a 
free, independent, and democratic future; 
(5) Ukraine has proven itself to be a valu-
able security partner of the United States, 
not simply a recipient of assistance; 
(6) it is in the national security interests 
of the United States to continue and deepen 
its security partnership with Ukraine, in-
cluding through the provision of both lethal 
and non-lethal assistance; 
(7) the United States should continue to 
place policy-based conditions on Ukraine’s 
receipt of financial and military assistance, 
as that mechanism has proven effective in 
incentivizing reforms in Ukraine; 
(8) the United States should use its voice 
and vote at NATO to encourage the adoption 
of a policy by the Alliance that all of its 
member states will refuse to recognize the il-
legal attempted annexation of Crimea by the 
Russian Federation; 
(9) the United States should support at the 
highest level and take an active part in the 
Ukrainian ‘‘Crimean Platform’’ initiative to 
ensure that the international community’s 
attention remains focused on— 
(A) the unacceptable violation of Ukraine’s 
territorial integrity in Crimea; and 
(B) working towards the reversal of such 
violation; 
(10) the United States should continue to 
bolster the capacity of the Ukrainian Navy 
as it strives to fulfill the goals it set out in 
its ‘‘Strategy of the Naval Forces of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine 2035’’; 
(11) the military-focused technical, train-
ing, maintenance, and logistical assistance 
provided by the United States to Ukraine is 
as essential as the military hardware pro-
vided to the country; 
(12) all security assistance provided to 
Ukraine should continue to be subject to rig-
orous vetting requirements under section 
620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
U.S.C. 2378d) and security cooperation under 
section 362 of title 10, United States Code, in-
cluding assistance provided to units in the 
National Guard of Ukraine as well as all 
units falling under the authority of the Min-
istry of Defense; 
(13) the Office of Defense Cooperation at 
the United States Embassy in Ukraine 
should be fully staffed with officers who 
serve three-year terms in order to admin-
ister the security assistance being provided 
to the country; 
(14) the Secretary of Defense should con-
duct an assessment of the staffing resources 
of the Office of Defense Cooperation and 
strongly consider providing additional staff 
to the Office of Defense Cooperation in 
Ukraine; 
(15) the United States should continue to 
support Ukraine’s NATO aspirations, includ-
ing through work towards a Membership Ac-
tion Plan; 
(16) the enduring partnership between the 
United States and Ukraine, including bipar-
tisan support for a sovereign, democratic, 
and whole Ukraine through political, mone-
tary, 
and 
military 
assistance, 
remains 
strong and must continue to be reaffirmed; 
and 
(17) the United States should continue to 
strongly support Ukraine’s ambitions to join 
the Euro-Atlantic community of democ-
racies. 
SEC. 1294. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to refuse to recognize the attempted an-
nexation of Crimea by the Russian Federa-
tion, an action that was taken in contraven-
tion of international law; 
(2) to utilize existing sanctions and other 
authorities to deter malign actions by the 
Russian Federation in or intended to harm 
Ukraine, including the mandates and au-
thorities codified by— 
(A) the Countering America’s Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9401 et 
seq.); and 
(B) the Protecting Europe’s Energy Secu-
rity Act of 2019 (title LXXV of Public Law 
116–92; 22 U.S.C. 9526 note); 
(3) to work with our European allies to co-
ordinate strategies to curtail Russian malign 
influence in Ukraine; 
(4) to work with our allies and partners to 
conduct more frequent multinational free-
dom of navigation operations in the Black 
Sea in order to demonstrate support for 
Ukraine’s internationally-recognized mari-
time boundaries, to safeguard the unimpeded

forts such as assistance in strengthening 
Ukraine’s investment screening and national 
security vetting laws. 
(C) An assessment of Ukraine’s efforts to 
make reforms necessary to incentivize West-
ern investment in Ukraine’s aerospace and

PRIMARY HEALTH SERVICE FOR UN-

(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Access to high quality primary care is 
associated with improved health outcomes 
and lower health care costs. 
(2) Substantial disparities exist in the dis-
tribution of primary care providers. 
(3) Shortages of health care providers af-
fect Tribal, rural, and medically underserved 
communities more than the populations of 
more densely populated areas, resulting in 
such communities experiencing significant 
health challenges and disparities. 
(4) American Indian, Alaskan Natives, and 
Native Hawaiians tend to have lower health 
status, lower life expectancy, and dispropor-
tionate disease burden when compared to 
other Americans. 
(5) Having training experiences in, living 
among, and being a member of Tribal, rural, 
and medically underserved communities in-
creases cultural awareness and can influence 
career choice for physicians to better serve 
such populations. 
(6) Research shows there is a relationship 
between the characteristics of a physician 
and the eventual practice location, including 
being part of an underrepresented minority 
or growing up in a rural area.

SEC. 1283. REPORTS ON CURRICULUM USED IN 
SCHOOLS IN AREAS CONTROLLED 
BY THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
AND IN GAZA. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) In 2016 and 2017, the Palestinian Author-
ity published modified curricula for school- 
aged children in grades 1 through 11. 
(2) Textbooks used by the Palestinian Au-
thority in the West Bank and Gaza include 
graphics portraying violence against Israeli 
soldiers, positive portrayals of individuals 
who have committed attacks against citizens 
of Israel, and references to Palestinian ef-
forts to target the ‘‘Zionists’’. 
(3) Palestinian Authority textbooks are 
used at schools sponsored by the United Na-
tions Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East because the 
schools use the textbooks of the host govern-
ment. 
(4) On April 26, 2018, the Government Ac-
countability Office published a report that 
found the following: 
(A) Textbooks in schools in areas con-
trolled by the Palestinian Authority feature 
inaccurate and misleading maps of the re-
gion and include militaristic, adversarial im-
agery and content that incite hatred. 
(B) The Department of State raised with 
Palestinian officials the objectionable con-
tent in the textbooks, including a specific 
math problem using the number of Pales-
tinian casualties in the First and Second 
Intifadas. 
(C) The United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near 
East, in its review of the textbooks, identi-
fied content not aligned with United Nations 
values, the majority of which content re-
lated to neutrality or bias issues, including 
issues related to maps and references to Je-
rusalem as the capital of Palestine. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Palestinian Authority has 
not sufficiently eliminated content encour-
aging violence or intolerance toward other 
countries or ethnic groups from the cur-
riculum used in schools in areas controlled 
by the Palestinian Authority. 
(c) REPORTS REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days

eign Relations of the Senate and the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
Representatives a report reviewing cur-
riculum used in schools in areas controlled 
by the Palestinian Authority or located in 
Gaza and controlled by any other entity. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—Each report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
(A) A determination of whether the cur-
riculum reviewed contains content encour-
aging violence or intolerance toward other 
countries or ethnic groups, and a detailed ex-
planation of the reasons for reaching such 
determination. 
(B) An assessment of the steps the Pales-
tinian Authority is taking to reform cur-
riculum containing such content at schools 
to conform with standards of peace and tol-
erance in the Declaration of Principles on 
Tolerance adopted by Member States of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization on November 16, 1995. 
(C) A determination of whether United 
States foreign assistance is used, directly or 
indirectly, to fund the dissemination of such 
curriculum by the Palestinian Authority. 
(D) A detailed report on how United States 
assistance is being used to address cur-
riculum that encourages violence or intoler-
ance toward other nations or ethnic groups. 
(E) A detailed report on United States dip-
lomatic efforts, during the 5-year period pre-
ceding the date on which the report is sub-
mitted, to encourage peace and tolerance in 
Palestinian education. 
(F) If any diplomatic efforts referred to in 
subparagraph (E) were stopped by the Sec-
retary of State, the reasons for such stop-
pages. 
(3) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.—The Secretary of 
State shall post on a publicly available 
website of the Department of State each re-
port required by paragraph (1). 
(4) SUBSEQUENT
DEADLINES.—Each report 
required by paragraph (1), other than the 
first such report, shall be submitted not 
later than 90 days after the date on which a 
new school year begins for schools in areas 
controlled by the Palestinian Authority.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7947 
November 4, 2021 
(d) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES
DEFINED.—In this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the Committee on Armed Services and 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Armed Services and 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives. 
SA 4456. Mr. RISCH (for himself and 
Mr. MURPHY) submitted an amendment 
intended to be proposed to amendment 
SA 3867 submitted by Mr. REED and in-
tended to be proposed to the bill H.R. 
4350, to authorize appropriations for 
fiscal year 2022 for military activities 
of the Department of Defense, for mili-
tary construction, and for defense ac-
tivities of the Department of Energy, 
to 
prescribe 
military 
personnel 
strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes; which was ordered to 
lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—Diplomatic Support and Security 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Diplo-
matic Support and Security Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) A robust overseas diplomatic presence 
is an effective foreign policy, particularly in 
unstable environments where a flexible and 
timely diplomatic response can be decisive 
in preventing and addressing violent con-
flict. 
(2) Diplomats routinely put themselves and 
their families at great personal risk to serve 
their country overseas where they increas-
ingly face threats related to international 
terrorism, 
violent 
conflict, 
and 
public 
health, among others. 
(3) The Department of State has a remark-
able record of protecting personnel while en-
abling an enormous amount of global diplo-
matic activity, often in unsecure and remote 
places and facing a variety of evolving risks 
and threats. With support from Congress, the 
Department of State has revised policy, im-
proved physical security through retrofitting 
and replacing old facilities, deployed addi-
tional security personnel and armored vehi-
cles, and greatly enhanced training require-
ments and facilities, including the new For-
eign Affairs Security Training Center in 
Blackstone, Virginia. 
(4) However, there is broad consensus that 
the pendulum has swung too far toward 
eliminating risk, excessively inhibiting dip-
lomatic activity, too often resulting in em-
bassy closures, reducing footprints, and post-
poning or denying travel requests. 
(5) Diplomatic missions rely on robust 
staffing and ambitious external engagement 
to advance United States interests as diverse 
as competing with China’s malign influence 
around the world, fighting terrorism and 
transnational organized crime, preventing 
and addressing violent conflict and humani-
tarian disasters, promoting United States 
businesses and trade, protecting the rights of 
marginalized 
groups, 
addressing 
climate 
change, and preventing pandemic disease. 
(6) Despite the fact that Congress cur-
rently provides annual appropriations in ex-
cess of $1,900,000,000 for embassy security, 
construction, and maintenance, the Depart-
ment of State is unable to fully transform 
this considerable investment into true over-
seas presence given excessive movement and 
safety restrictions that inhibit the ability of 
diplomats to— 
(A) meet outside United States secured fa-
cilities with foreign leaders to explain, de-
fend, and advance United States priorities; 
(B) understand and report on foreign polit-
ical, 
social, 
and 
economic 
conditions 
through meeting and interacting with com-
munity officials outside of United States fa-
cilities; 
(C) provide United States citizen services 
that can be are often a matter of life and 
death in unsecure places; and 
(D) collaborate and, at times, compete 
with other diplomatic missions, such as the 
People’s Republic of China, that do not have 
the same restrictions on meeting locations. 
(7) Given these stakes, Congress has a re-
sponsibility to empower, support, and hold 
the Department of State accountable for im-
plementing an aggressive presence strategy 
that mitigates potential risks and ade-
quately considers the myriad direct and indi-
rect consequences of a lack of presence. 
SEC. 1293. ENCOURAGING EXPEDITIONARY DI-
PLOMACY. 
(a) PURPOSE.—Subsection (b) of section 102 
of the Diplomatic Security Act (22 U.S.C. 
4801(b)) is amended— 
(1) by amending paragraph (3) to read as 
follows: 
‘‘(3) to promote strengthened security 
measures, institutionalize a culture of learn-
ing, and, in the case of apparent gross neg-
ligence or breach of duty, recommend the Di-
rector General of the Foreign Service inves-
tigate accountability for United States Gov-
ernment personnel with security-related re-
sponsibilities;’’; 
(2) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) 
as paragraphs (5) and (6), respectively; and 
(3) by inserting after paragraph (3) the fol-
lowing new paragraph: 
‘‘(4) to support a culture of risk manage-
ment, instead of risk avoidance, that enables 
the Department of State to pursue its vital 
goals with full knowledge that it is not de-
sirable nor possible for the Department to 
avoid all risks;’’. 
(b) BRIEFINGS ON EMBASSY SECURITY.—Sec-
tion 105(a)(1) of the Diplomatic Security Act 
(22 U.S.C. 4804(a)) is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘any plans to open or re-
open a high risk, high threat post’’ and in-
serting ‘‘progress towards opening or reopen-
ing high risk, high threat posts, and the risk 
to national security of the continued closure 
and remaining barriers to doing so’’; 
(2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ‘‘the 
type and level of security threats such post 
could encounter’’ and inserting ‘‘the risk to 
national security of the post’s continued clo-
sure’’; and 
(3) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ‘‘the 
type and level of security threats such post 
could 
encounter, 
and’’ 
before 
‘‘security 
‘tripwires’ ’’.

RITY INCIDENTS.

equate to mitigate the threat and attack.

or group of officers conducting an approved 
operation outside the mission, a determina-
tion whether a valid process was followed in 
evaluating

SEC. llll. UNITED STATES GRAND STRATEGY 
WITH RESPECT TO CHINA. 
(a) FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) The United States is in a new era of 
geostrategic and geoeconomic competition 
with the People’s Republic of China, a great 
power that seeks to challenge international 
norms, laws and institutions, and confront 
the United States across diplomatic, eco-
nomic, military, technological, and informa-
tional domains. 
(B) As it has during previous periods of 
great power competition, the United States 
must articulate and refine its grand strat-
egy, including through rigorous testing of 
assumptions and by drawing on expertise 
outside the United States Government, to 
ensure its ultimate success, as well as global 
peace, stability, and shared prosperity. 
(C) Historically, presidents of the United 
States have used different models for grand 
strategy development, including the fol-
lowing efforts: 
(i) In January 1950, President Truman re-
quested an in-depth report on the state of 
the world, actions taken by adversaries of 
the United States, and the development of a 
comprehensive national strategy, resulting 
in a paper entitled ‘‘United States Objectives 
and Programs for National Security’’, also 
known as NSC-68. 
(ii) President Eisenhower utilized experts 
from both within and outside the United 
States Government during Project Solarium 
to produce NSC 162/2, a ‘‘Statement of Policy 
by the National Security Council on Basic 
National Security Policy’’ in order to ‘‘meet 
the Soviet Threat to U.S. security’’ and 
guide United States national security policy. 
(iii) President Ford authorized the Team B 
project to draw in experts from outside the 
United States Government to question and 
strengthen the analysis of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. 
(iv) President Reagan approved the Na-
tional Security Decision Directive Number 
75 in January 1983 to organize United States 
strategy toward the Soviet Union in order to 
clarify and orient United States policies to-
ward specific objectives vis a vis the Soviet 
Union. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should draw 
upon previous successful models of grand 
strategy to articulate a strategy that appro-
priately addresses the evolving challenges 
and contours of the new era of geostrategic 
and geoeconomic competition with the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China. 
(b) UNITED STATES GRAND STRATEGY WITH 
RESPECT TO CHINA.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days 
after the date on which the President first 
submits to Congress a national security 
strategy under section 108 of the National 
Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3043) after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Presi-
dent shall commence developing a com-
prehensive report that articulates the strat-
egy of the United States with respect to the 
People’s Republic of China (in this section 
referred to as the ‘‘China Strategy’’) that 
builds on the work of such national security 
strategy. 
(2) SUBMITTAL.—Not later than 270 days 
after the date on which the President first 
submits to Congress a national security 
strategy under section 108 of the National 
Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3043) after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Presi-
dent shall submit to Congress the China 
Strategy developed under paragraph (1). 
(3) FORM.—The China Strategy shall be 
submitted in classified form and shall in-
clude an unclassified summary. 
(c) CONTENTS.—The China Strategy devel-
oped under subsection (b) shall set forth the 
national security strategy of the United 
States with respect to the People’s Republic 
of China and shall include a comprehensive 
description and discussion of the following: 
(1) The strategy of the People’s Republic of 
China regarding the military, economic, and 
political power of China in the Indo-Pacific 
region and worldwide, including why the 
People’s Republic of China has decided on 
such strategy and what the strategy means 
for the long-term interests, values, goals, 
and objectives of the United States. 
(2) The worldwide interests, values, goals, 
and objectives of the United States as they 
relate to geostrategic and geoeconomic com-
petition with the People’s Republic of China. 
(3) The foreign and economic policy, world-
wide commitments, and national defense ca-
pabilities of the United States necessary to 
deter aggression and to implement the na-
tional security strategy of the United States 
as they relate to the new era of competition 
with the People’s Republic of China. 
(4) How the United States will exercise the 
political, economic, military, diplomatic, 
and other elements of its national power to 
protect or advance its interests and values 
and achieve the goals and objectives referred 
to in paragraph (1). 
(5) The adequacy of the capabilities of the 
United States Government to carry out the 
national security strategy of the United 
States within the context of new and emer-
gent challenges to the international order 
posed by the People’s Republic of China, in-
cluding an evaluation— 
(A) of the balance among the capabilities 
of all elements of national power of the 
United States; and 
(B) the balance of all United States ele-
ments of national power in comparison to 
equivalent elements of national power of the 
People’s Republic of China. 
(6) The assumptions and end-state or end- 
states of the strategy of the United States 
globally and in the Indo-Pacific region with 
respect to the People’s Republic of China. 
(7) Such other information as the Presi-
dent considers necessary to help inform Con-
gress on matters relating to the national se-
curity strategy of the United States with re-
spect to the People’s Republic of China.

At the end of subtitle B of title XII of divi-
sion A, add the following: 
SECTION 
1216. 
RESTRICTIONS 
RELATING 
TO 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTI-
TUTION 
ASSISTANCE 
TO 
THE 
TALIBAN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) In August 2021, in response to the 
Taliban’s toppling of the internationally rec-
ognized Government of Afghanistan, and 
growing 
concerns 
over 
reported 
human 
rights abuses, donors suspended foreign aid 
to Afghanistan, which accounts for approxi-
mately 40 percent of Afghanistan’s gross do-
mestic product. 
(2) Among the donors referred to in para-
graph (1) are international financial institu-
tions, such as the International Monetary 
Fund, which froze the disbursement of more 
than $400,000,000 in emergency currency re-
serves allocated to Afghanistan because of 
concerns related to the credibility and legit-
imacy of the Taliban rule. 
(3) The World Bank, which has committed 
more than $5,300,000,000 in reconstruction 
and development funding for Afghanistan 
since 2002, similarly suspended funding for 
projects in Afghanistan, citing concerns over 
how Taliban rule would impact ‘‘the coun-
ty’s development prospects, especially for 
women’’. 
(4) Since Taliban rule in Afghanistan 
threatens vital gains achieved in Afghani-
stan during the past 20 years, particularly 
gains regarding the rule of law, counterter-
rorism, and the rights of women and girls, it 
should be denied credibility and inter-
national legitimacy on the world stage. 
(5) In April 2021, Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken stated, ‘‘I can say very clearly and 
categorically that an Afghanistan that does 
not respect [the rights of women and girls], 
that does not sustain the gains we’ve made, 
will be a pariah.’’. 
(6) Despite the freeze in funding, the World 
Bank, along with the rest of the inter-
national community— 
(A) remains firmly committed to assisting 
the Afghan people; and 
(B) is ‘‘exploring ways [through which the 
World Bank] can remain engaged to preserve 
hard-won development gains and continue to 
support the people of Afghanistan.’’. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States to oppose the extension 
of loans, guarantees, or other financial or 
technical assistance to the Taliban, any 
agency or instrumentality of the Govern-
ment of Afghanistan that is under the direc-
tion or control of the Taliban, or any mem-
ber of the Taliban until the Taliban has— 
(1) publicly and privately broken all ties 
with other terrorist groups, including al 
Qaeda; 
(2) verifiably prevented the use of Afghani-
stan as a platform for terrorist attacks 
against the United States or against part-
ners or allies of the United States, including 
by denying terrorist groups— 
(A) sanctuary space in Afghanistan; 
(B) transit through Afghan territory; and 
(C) the use of Afghanistan for terrorist 
training, planning, or equipping; 
(3) provided humanitarian actors with full, 
unimpeded access to vulnerable populations 
throughout 
Afghanistan, 
without 
inter-
ference or diversion; 
(4) respected freedom of movement, includ-
ing by facilitating— 
(A) the departure of foreign nationals, ap-
plicants for the special immigrant visa pro-
gram, and other at-risk Afghans by air or 
land routes; and 
(B) the safe, voluntary, and dignified re-
turn of displaced persons; and 
(5) supported the establishment of an in-
clusive government of Afghanistan that re-
spects the rule of law, press freedom, and 
human rights, including the rights of women 
and girls. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
the Senate; 
(B) the Committee on Appropriations of 
the Senate; 
(C) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives; 
(D) the Committee on Appropriations of 
the House of Representatives.

and (3), the Secretary of the Treasury 
should— 
(A) instruct the United States Executive 
Director of the World Bank Group to use the

approach that makes all future engagements 
with and lending to the Taliban contingent 
upon the Taliban— 
(i) publicly and privately breaking all ties 
with other terrorist groups, including al 
Qaeda; 
(ii) verifiably preventing the use of Af-

SA 4489. Mr. RISCH submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 3867 submitted by Mr. 
REED and intended to be proposed to 
the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize appro-
priations for fiscal year 2022 for mili-
tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place in title XII, insert 
the following: 
SEC. ll. AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO A COOPER-
ATIVE AGREEMENT TO PROTECT CI-
VILIANS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE 
UNITED 
ARAB 
EMIRATES 
FROM 
WEAPONIZED 
UNMANNED 
AERIAL 
SYSTEMS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Houthis in Yemen have signifi-
cantly intensified the number of cross-border 
strikes against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
since January 2021, using a combination of 
increasingly sophisticated Unmanned Ariel 
Vehicles (UAVs) and cruise missiles to target 
civilian infrastructure, bases, commercial 
shipping, 
and 
major 
population 
centers 
across the Kingdom with unprecedented fre-
quency. 
(2) The United Nations has noted the 
Houthis have deployed extended long-range 
UAVs with the capacity to strike deep into 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 
since at least January 2018. 
(3) Between January and April 2021, the 
Houthis launched upward of 150 UAVs into 
Saudi Arabia, threatening the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia’s sovereignty and security, as 
well as the lives of more than 70,000 United 
States nationals living there. 
(4) Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sarea re-
sponded to a realistic peace proposal pre-
sented by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in 
March 2021, by threatening ‘‘to carry out 
stronger and harsher military attacks in the 
coming period.’’. 
(5) United States Government officials, in-
cluding Special Envoy Timothy Lenderking, 
have publically underscored the crucial role 
the Government of Iran plays in driving this 
growing and continuous threat that ema-
nates from the Houthis in Yemen. 
(6) According to United States officials and 
United Nations experts, the Government of 
Iran, 
alongside 
its 
Lebanese 
proxy, 
Hezbollah, are providing sophisticated weap-
ons systems and military training to the 
Houthis, including technical assistance on 
the development and employment of UAVs 
and ballistic missiles. 
(7) The Houthi rebels have also made sig-
nificant advances in their domestic military 
industrial capacity in recent years, drawing 
on Iranian sourced components, including 
guidance systems to develop several new ad-
vanced platforms like the Burkan medium 
range ballistic missile and the Sammad 
drone series that have extend the Houthi’s 
reach deep into Saudi Arabia. 
(8) The Houthi’s growing arsenal of in-
creasingly sophisticated drones, and ballistic 
missiles, and cruise missiles pose a direct 
threat to United States interests, particu-
larly as relates to regional security, the safe-
ty of United States nationals, and the trajec-
tory of United Nations-led peace talks. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States should improve co-
operation with allies and likeminded part-
ners to systematically map out, expose, and 
disrupt missile and drone procurement net-
works used by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels 
in Yemen; 
(2) the partner countries of the United 
States in the Arabian Peninsula face urgent 
and emerging threats from unmanned aerial 
systems and other unmanned aerial vehicles; 
(3) joint research and development to 
counter unmanned aerial systems will serve 
the national security interests of the United 
States and its partners in the Arabian Penin-
sula; 
(4) development of counter Unmanned Air-
craft Systems (UAS) technology will reduce 
the impacts of these attacks, build deter-

by section 201(b) of the Asia Reassurance Ini-
tiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409; 132 
Stat. 5391), and $798,000,000 in the diplomatic 
engagement budget. These amounts rep-
resent only 5 percent of the diplomatic en-
gagement budget and only 4 percent of the 
combined Department of State and United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment budget.

sonnel levels in the Indo-Pacific region aver-
aged only 5 percent of the total Department 
of States budget, while foreign assistance re-
sources averaged only 4 percent of the total 
resources committed worldwide. 
(3) In 2020, the Department of State began 
a process to realign certain positions at 
posts to ensure that its personnel footprint 
matches the demands of great-power com-
petition, including in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion.

corps must be sufficient to meet the current

elsewhere; 
(2) increases in the diplomatic corps must 
be designed to meet the objectives of an 
Indo-Pacific strategy focused on strength-
ening the good governance and sovereignty 
of states that adhere to and uphold the rules- 
based international order; and 
(3) increase in the diplomatic corps must 
be implemented with a focus on increased 
numbers of economic, political, and public

other countries, including countries that 
pose challenges to United States interests 
around the world, for defense-related innova-
tion and investment; and

to continue to increase cooperation with 
Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom

tect critical defense-related technology and 
services and leverage the investments of

tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of division A, add the following: 
TITLE XVII—AFGHANISTAN COUNTERTER-
RORISM, OVERSIGHT, AND ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT OF 2021 
SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Afghani-
stan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Ac-
countability Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1702. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) On April 14, 2021, President Joseph R. 
Biden announced the unconditional with-
drawal of United States Armed Forces from 
Afghanistan after 20 years of conflict. 
(2) United States troop withdrawals led to 
the rapid collapse of the democratically 
elected Government of Afghanistan, effec-
tively ended prospects for a negotiated set-
tlement, threaten to reverse the hard-earned 
rights of Afghanistan’s women and youth, 
and created dangerous sanctuary space for 
potential 
terrorist 
attacks 
against 
the 
United States and allies and partners of the 
United States. 
(3) Under the terms of the peace agreement 
signed by the United States and the Taliban 
in Doha, Qatar, on February 29, 2020, the 
withdrawal of the United States Armed 
Forces was contingent upon the Taliban up-
holding its commitment to a reduction in 
the levels of violence, engaging in sub-
stantive talks with the Government of Af-
ghanistan, and adhering to certain counter-
terrorism guarantees. The Taliban failed to 
meet its commitments. 
(4) The Taliban’s rise to power and inabil-
ity to control its borders may result in a safe 
haven for violent jihadist groups, like al 
Qaeda and the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic 
State group, ISIS–Khorasan (commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘ISIS–K’’). 
(5) According to a May 2020 report of the 
United Nations, ‘‘The senior leadership of Al- 
Qaida remains present in Afghanistan, as 
well as hundreds of armed operatives, Al- 
Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, and 
groups of foreign terrorist fighters aligned 
with the Taliban.’’. 
(6) According to the same United Nations 
report, ‘‘The Taliban regularly consulted 
with Al-Qaida during negotiations with the 
United States and offered guarantees that it 
would honor their historical ties.’’. 
(7) In November 2020, the Lead Inspector 
General for Operation Freedom’s Sentinel of 
the Department of Defense (in this section 
referred to as the ‘‘Lead Inspector General’’) 
echoed similar concerns, noting that ‘‘mem-
bers of al-Qaeda were integrated into the 
Taliban’s leadership and command struc-
ture’’. 
(8) In May 2021, the Lead Inspector General 
reaffirmed 
those 
concerns, 
noting 
that 
‘‘[a]ccording to the Defense Intelligence 
Agency, the Taliban maintained close ties 
with al-Qaeda and was very likely preparing 
for large-scale offensives’’. 
(9) On September 14, 2021, the Deputy Di-
rector of the Central Intelligence Agency 
stated, ‘‘We are already beginning to see 
some of the indications of some potential 
movement of al Qaeda to Afghanistan.’’. 
(10) On August 14, 2021, the United States 
began an operation at Hamid Karzai Inter-
national Airport to evacuate United States 
citizens and Afghans affiliated with the 
United States, an action which forced the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘NATO’’) and allied 
countries to undertake similar operations. 
(11) During the evacuation operation con-
ducted in August 2021, United States allies, 
all of which had contributed soldiers and re-
sources to the fight against the Taliban and 
terrorism in Afghanistan since 2001, assisted 
in the exfiltration of thousands of United

States citizens, their own nationals, and Af-
ghans affiliated with NATO. 
(12) In August 2021, at the height of the 
United States evacuation operation, ISIS–K 
carried out a dual attack striking Hamid 
Karzai International Airport and the Baron 
Hotel, killing more than 170 civilians, in-
cluding 13 members of the United States 
Armed Forces. 
(13) According to the reports of the Depart-
ment of State, as many as 10,000 to 15,000 
United States citizens were in Afghanistan 
before the evacuation efforts. 
(14) As of August 31, 2021, the Department 
of State evacuated just over 6,000 United 
States citizens, leaving untold numbers of 
United States citizens stranded in Afghani-
stan with little recourse for departure. 
(15) As of August 31, 2021, the United States 
evacuated 705 out of 22,000 Afghans who ap-
plied for special immigrant visas, leaving the 
vast majority of Afghans behind and vulner-
able to retribution by the Taliban. 
(16) The Taliban continues to hamper the 
movement of United States citizens and at- 
risk Afghans out of Afghanistan. 
(17) On September 10, 2021, the Taliban ap-
pointed Sirajjudin Haqqani, a wanted ter-
rorist responsible for attacks against United 
States citizens, as the Taliban minister of 
interior, ostensibly responsible for the con-
tinued evacuations of United States citizens 
and at-risk Afghans out of Afghanistan. 
(18) A Taliban-led government rooted in 
Sharia law would undermine the vital gains 
made since 2001, particularly with respect to 
the rule of law and the rights of women and 
girls, and would lack credibility and inter-
national legitimacy on the world stage. 
(19) As noted by Human Rights Watch, 
‘‘Even before their takeover of Kabul on Au-
gust 15, Taliban forces were already commit-
ting atrocities, including summary execu-
tions of government officials and security 
force members in their custody.’’. 
(20) Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul, 
the Taliban has raided the homes of journal-
ists and activists, as well as members of 
their families, and restricted girls’ access to 
education and women’s ability to work. 
(21) The Lead Inspector General reported in 
May 2021 that the Taliban had carried out 
‘‘dozens of targeted killings of Afghan civil-
ians, including government officials, teach-
ers, journalists, medical workers, and reli-
gious scholars’’. 
(22) Despite reportedly providing written 
assurances to donors and the United Nations, 
the Taliban also continues to hinder humani-
tarian access to the most vulnerable areas 
and individuals in Afghanistan, with an esti-
mated 18,400,000 people, or roughly half of 
the population in Afghanistan, currently in 
dire need of lifesaving assistance. 
(23) Between 2001 and 2020, at least 569 hu-
manitarian workers were targeted for attack 
in Afghanistan, and in August 2021 alone, at 
least 240 incidents affecting humanitarian 
access were reported by relief agencies. 
(24) The United States has invested more 
than $56,000,000,000 since 2002 in efforts to ad-
dress profound humanitarian needs and help 
the people of Afghanistan, including women, 
girls, and religious and ethnic minorities, re-
alize their democratic and development aspi-
rations. 
(25) Despite consistent challenges, United 
States humanitarian and development as-
sistance has helped expand access to edu-
cation for more than 3,000,000 girls since 2008, 
reduce maternal and child deaths by more 
than half since 2000, provide first-time access 
to safe drinking water for 650,000 people and 
improved sanitation services for 1,200,000 
people since 2016, and catalyze a 3,000 percent 
increase in per capita gross domestic product 
between 2002 and 2018. 
(26) Following the Taliban takeover in Af-
ghanistan, those notable achievements are 
at risk of reversal, the country stands on the 
verge of economic collapse, and according to 
the World Food Programme of the United 
Nations, an estimated 14,000,000 people are 
‘‘marching toward starvation’’.

SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘U.S.- 
Greece Defense and Interparliamentary Part-
nership Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States and Greece are 
strong allies in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) and have deepened 
their defense relationship in recent years in 
response to growing security challenges in 
the Eastern Mediterranean region. 
(2) Greece participates in several NATO 
missions, including Operation Sea Guardian 
in the Mediterranean and NATO’s mission in 
Kosovo. 
(3) The Eastern Mediterranean Security 
and Energy Partnership Act (title II of divi-
sion J of Public Law 116–94), authorized new 
security assistance for Greece and Cyprus, 
lifted the United States prohibition on arms 
transfers to Cyprus, and authorized the es-
tablishment of a United States-Eastern Med-
iterranean Energy Center to facilitate en-
ergy cooperation among the United States, 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus. 
(4) The United States has demonstrated its 
support for the trilateral partnership of 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus through joint en-
gagement with Cyprus, Greece, Israel, and 
the United States in the ‘‘3+1’’ format. 
(5) The United States and Greece have held 
Strategic Dialogue meetings in Athens, 
Washington D.C., and virtually, and have 
committed to hold an upcoming Strategic 
Dialogue session in 2021 in Washington, D.C. 
(6) In October 2019, the United States and 
Greece agreed to update the United States- 
Greece Mutual Defense Cooperation Agree-
ment, and the amended agreement officially 
entered into force on February 13, 2020. 
(7) The amended Mutual Defense Coopera-
tion Agreement provides for increased joint 
United States-Greece and NATO activities at 
Greek 
military 
bases 
and 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, Alexandroupolis, and 
other parts of central and northern Greece, 
and allows for infrastructure improvements 
at the United States Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay base on Crete. 
(8) In October 2020, Greek Foreign Minister 
Nikos Dendias announced that Greece hopes 
to further expand the Mutual Defense Co-
operation Agreement with the United States. 
(9) The United States Naval Support Activ-
ity Souda Bay serves as a critical naval lo-
gistics hub for the United States Navy’s 6th 
Fleet. 
(10) In June 2020, United States Ambas-
sador to Greece Geoffrey Pyatt characterized 
the importance of Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay as ‘‘our most important platform 
for the projection of American power into a 
strategically dynamic Eastern Mediterra-
nean region. From Syria to Libya to the 
chokepoint of the Black Sea, this is a criti-
cally important asset for the United States, 
as our air force, naval, and other resources 
are applied to support our Alliance obliga-
tions and to help bring peace and stability.’’. 
(11) The USS Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, 
the second of a new class of United States 
sea-basing ships, is now based out of Souda 
Bay, the first permanent United States naval 
deployment at the base. 
(12) The United States cooperates with the 
Hellenic 
Armed 
Forces 
at 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, and Alexandroupolis, 
where the United States Armed Forces con-
duct training, refueling, temporary mainte-
nance, storage, and emergency response. 
(13) The United States has conducted a 
longstanding International Military Edu-
cation and Training (IMET) program with 
Greece, and the Government of Greece has 
committed to provide $3 for every dollar in-
vested by the United States in the program. 
(14) Greece’s defense spending in 2020 
amounted to an estimated 2.68 percent of its 
gross domestic product (GDP), exceeding 
NATO’s 2 percent of GDP benchmark agreed 
to at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales. 
(15) Greece is eligible for the delivery of ex-
cess defense articles under section 516(c)(2) of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2321j(c)(2)). 
(16) In September 2020, Greek Prime Min-
ister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced plans 
to modernize all three branches of the Hel-
lenic Armed Forces, which will strengthen 
Greece’s military position in the Eastern 
Mediterranean. 
(17) The modernization includes upgrades 
to the arms of all three branches, including 
new anti-tank weapons for the Hellenic 
Army, new heavy-duty torpedoes for the Hel-
lenic Navy, and new guided missiles for the 
Hellenic Air Force. 
(18) The Hellenic Navy also plans to up-
grade its four MEKO 200HN frigates and pur-
chase four new multirole frigates of an un-
disclosed type, to be accompanied by 4 MH- 
60R anti-submarine helicopters. 
(19) The Hellenic Air Force plans to fully 
upgrade its fleet of F–16 jets to the F–16 
Viper variant by 2027 and has expressed in-
terest in participating in the F–35 Joint 
Strike Fighter program. 
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) Greece is a pillar of stability in the 
Eastern 
Mediterranean 
region 
and 
the 
United States should remain committed to 
supporting its security and prosperity; 
(2) the 3+1 format of cooperation among 
Cyprus, Greece, Israel, and the United States 
has been a successful forum to cooperate on 
energy issues and should be expanded to in-
clude other areas of common concern to the

(3) the United States should increase and 
deepen efforts to partner with and support 
the modernization of the Greek military; 
(4) it is in the interests of the United 
States that Greece continue to transition its 
military equipment away from Russian-pro-
duced 
platforms 
and 
weapons 
systems 
through the European Recapitalization In-
vestment Program; 
(5) the United States Government should 
continue to deepen strong partnerships with 
the Greek military, especially in co-develop-
ment and co-production opportunities with 
the Greek Navy; 
(6) the naval partnerships with Greece at 
Souda Bay and Alexandroupolis are mutu-

TITLE 
I—ORGANIZATION 
AND 
OPER-
ATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
SEC. 5101. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE 
OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE’S WORK. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) United States global engagement is key 
to a stable and prosperous world; 
(2) United States leadership is indispen-
sable in light of the many complex and inter-
connected threats facing the United States 
and the world; 
(3) diplomacy and development are critical 
tools of national power, and full deployment 
of these tools is vital to United States na-
tional security; 
(4) challenges such as the global refugee 
and migration crises, terrorism, historic 
famine and food insecurity, and fragile or re-
pressive societies cannot be addressed with-
out sustained and robust United States dip-
lomatic and development leadership; 
(5) the United States Government must use 
all of the instruments of national security 
and foreign policy at its disposal to protect 
United 
States 
citizens, 
promote 
United 
States interests and values, and support 
global stability and prosperity; 
(6) United States security and prosperity 
depend on having partners and allies that 
share our interests and values, and these 
partnerships are nurtured and our shared in-
terests and values are promoted through 
United States diplomatic engagement, secu-
rity cooperation, economic statecraft, and 
assistance that helps further economic de-
velopment, good governance, including the 
rule of law and democratic institutions, and 
the development of shared responses to nat-
ural and humanitarian disasters; 
(7) as the United States Government agen-
cies primarily charged with conducting di-
plomacy and development, the Department 
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) require sus-
tained and robust funding to carry out this 
important work, which is essential to our 
ability to project United States leadership 
and values and to advance United States in-
terests around the world; 
(8) the work of the Department and USAID 
makes the United States and the world safer 
and more prosperous by alleviating global 
poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and 
other infectious diseases, strengthening alli-
ances, expanding educational opportunities 
for women and girls, promoting good govern-
ance and democracy, supporting anti-corrup-
tion efforts, driving economic development 
and trade, preventing armed conflicts and 
humanitarian crises, and creating American 
jobs and export opportunities; 
(9) the Department and USAID are vital 
national security agencies, whose work is 
critical to the projection of United States 
power and leadership worldwide, and without 
which Americans would be less safe, United 
States economic power would be diminished, 
and global stability and prosperity would 
suffer; 
(10) investing in diplomacy and develop-
ment before conflicts break out saves Amer-
ican lives while also being cost-effective; and 
(11) the contributions of personnel working 
at the Department and USAID are extraor-
dinarily valuable and allow the United 
States to maintain its leadership around the 
world. 
SEC. 5102. BUREAU OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN 
RIGHTS, AND LABOR.

envoys, ambassadors, and coordinators lo-
cated within the Bureau of Democracy,

rectly to the Assistant Secretary unless oth-
erwise provided by law.’’; 
(2) in subparagraph (B)(ii)— 
(A) by striking ‘‘section’’ and inserting 
‘‘sections 116 and’’; and 
(B) by inserting before the period at the 
end the following: ‘‘(commonly referred to as 
the annual ‘Country Reports on Human 
Rights Practices’)’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraphs: 
‘‘(C) AUTHORITIES.—In addition to the du-
ties, functions, and responsibilities specified 
in this paragraph, the Assistant Secretary of 
State for Democracy, Human Rights, and 
Labor is authorized to— 
‘‘(i) promote democracy and actively sup-

ment of candidates belonging to under-rep-
resented groups, including the Charles B. 
Rangel International Affairs Graduate Fel-
lowship Program, the Thomas R. Pickering

years and consistent with the need to main-
tain a pool of experienced personnel effec-
tively distributed across skill codes and

tion 301(b) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980

retary shall review past programs designed 
to increase minority representation in inter-
national affairs positions. 
SEC. 5409. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION.

cluding a covered entity, that is required to 
submit a covered cyber incident report or a 
ransom payment report may use a third 
party, such as an incident response company, 
insurance provider, service provider, infor-
mation sharing and analysis organization, or 
law firm, to submit the required report 
under subsection (a). 
‘‘(2) RANSOM

pacted by a ransomware attack uses a third 
party to make a ransom payment, the third 
party shall not be required to submit a ran-
som payment report for itself under sub-
section (a)(2). 
‘‘(3) DUTY TO REPORT.—Third-party report-
ing under this subparagraph does not relieve 
a covered entity or an entity that makes a 
ransom payment from the duty to comply 
with the requirements for covered cyber inci-
dent report or ransom payment report sub-
mission. 
‘‘(4) RESPONSIBILITY TO ADVISE.—Any third 
party used by an entity that knowingly 
makes a ransom payment on behalf of an en-

quest information about the incident or ran-
som payment, and if the Director is unable 
to obtain information through such engage-
ment, by issuing a subpoena to the entity, 
pursuant to subsection (c), to gather infor-

made the request for information in sub-
section (b), the Director has received no re-
sponse from the entity from which such in-
formation was requested, or received an in-
adequate response, the Director may issue to 
such entity a subpoena to compel disclosure 
of information the Director deems necessary 
to determine whether a covered cyber inci-
dent or ransom payment has occurred and 
obtain the information required to be re-
ported pursuant to section 2232 and any im-
plementing regulations. 
‘‘(2) CIVIL ACTION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If an entity fails to com-
ply with a subpoena, the Director may refer 
the matter to the Attorney General to bring 
a civil action in a district court of the 
United States to enforce such subpoena.

graph may be brought in the judicial district 
in which the entity against which the action 
is brought resides, is found, or does business.

punish a failure to comply with a subpoena 
issued under this subsection as contempt of 
court.

the Director to issue a subpoena under this 
subsection may not be delegated. 
‘‘(4) DEBARMENT
OF
FEDERAL
CONTRAC-
TORS.—If a covered entity with a Federal 
Government contract, grant, cooperative 
agreement, or other transaction agreement 
fails to comply with a subpoena issued under 
this subsection— 
‘‘(A) the Director may refer the matter to 
the Administrator of General Services; and 
‘‘(B) upon receiving a referral from the Di-
rector, the Administrator of General Serv-
ices may impose additional available pen-
alties, including suspension or debarment. 
‘‘(d) ACTIONS
BY ATTORNEY GENERAL
AND 
REGULATORS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding section 
2235(a) and subsection (b)(2) of this section, if 
the Attorney General or the appropriate reg-
ulator determines, based on information pro-
vided in response to a subpoena issued pursu-
ant to subsection (c), that the facts relating 
to the covered cyber incident or ransom pay-
ment at issue may constitute grounds for a 
regulatory enforcement action or criminal 
prosecution, the Attorney General or the ap-
propriate regulator may use that informa-
tion for a regulatory enforcement action or 
criminal prosecution. 
‘‘(2) APPLICATION TO CERTAIN ENTITIES AND 
THIRD PARTIES.—A covered cyber incident or 
ransom payment report submitted to the

priations for fiscal year 2022 for mili-

At the end of subtitle G of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1283. CONTINGENCY PLAN RELATING TO 
FLOATING OIL STORAGE AND OFF-
LOADING VESSEL SAFER. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the condition of the floating storage 
and offloading vessel (FSO) Safer in the port 
of Hodeidah in Yemen poses a significant 
threat to the economic, ecological, and hu-
manitarian environment of the countries 
bordering the Red Sea; 
(2) the Houthis have repeatedly obstructed 
efforts by the international community, in-
cluding the United Nations, to inspect and 
repair the FSO Safer; 
(3) a spill of the nearly 1,000,000 barrels of 
crude oil contained in the FSO Safer, four 
times the amount spilled in the Exxon Valdez 
disaster in 1989, would result in devastating 
ecological damage to the unique environ-
ment of the Red Sea, and would profoundly 
damage fishing industries along both sides of 
the Red Sea Coast, especially in Yemen; 
(4) a spill from the FSO Safer would— 
(A) block a vital shipping lane through 
which 10 percent of annual trade transits; 
and 
(B) disrupt international trade during a 
time in which countries around the world 
continue efforts to recover from the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
(5) the people of Yemen continue to face 
dire circumstances, and such circumstances 
would be exacerbated by a spill from the FSO 
Safer because such a spill would close of the 
port of Hodeidah, through which 2⁄3 of Yem-
en’s food is transferred, and result in the po-
tential for widespread famine and malnutri-
tion; and 
(6) Congress should encourage the efforts of 
various parties, including the United Nations 
and other regional stakeholders, to resolve 
the dangerous situation posed by the FSO 
Safer and find a lasting solution to the crisis, 
including by contributing financially to ef-
forts— 
(A) to prevent an oil spill from the FSO 
Safer; and 
(B) in the event of such a spill, to mitigate 
the effects of the spill. 
(b) CONTINGENCY PLAN.— 
(1) 
INTERAGENCY
WORKING
GROUP.—Not 
later than 30 days after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of State 
shall establish an interagency working group 
consisting of representatives of relevant 
Federal agencies, including the Department 
of Defense, the United States Mission to the 
United Nations, the United States Agency 
for International Development, and the Fed-
eral Emergency Management Agency, to de-
velop a contingency plan to be implemented 
in the event a crude oil leak from, or an ex-
plosion on, the FSO Safer. 
(2) REPORT.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of State and representatives of 
the interagency working group established 
under paragraph (1) shall submit to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate 
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives a report on the sta-
tus of the contingency plan developed under 
that paragraph that describes— 
(i) the options available to the United 
States Government for mitigating the eco-
nomic, ecological, and humanitarian crises 
that would result from a disaster related to 
the FSO Safer; and 
(ii) the steps already taken by the United 
States Government and international and re-
gional stakeholders— 
(I) to encourage a diplomatic solution to 
the situation; and 
(II) to prepare for the eventuality that a 
disaster may occur before such a solution is 
reached.

Mr. TUBERVILLE sub-
mitted an amendment intended to be 
proposed to amendment SA 3867 sub-
mitted by Mr. REED and intended to be 
proposed to the bill H.R. 4350, to au-
thorize appropriations for fiscal year 
2022 for military activities of the De-
partment of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of 
the Department of Energy, to prescribe 
military personnel strengths for such 
fiscal year, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title XXXI, add 
the following: 
SEC. 3157. PRESERVATION AND STORAGE OF 
URANIUM-233 TO FOSTER DEVELOP-
MENT OF THORIUM MOLTEN-SALT 
REACTORS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Thorium molten-salt reactor tech-
nology was originally developed in the 
United States, primarily at the Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory in the State of Ten-
nessee. 
(2) Before the cancellation of the program 
in 1976, the technology developed at the Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory was moving 
steadily toward efficient utilization of the 
natural thorium energy resource, which ex-
ists in substantial amounts in many parts of 
the United States and around the world. 
(3) The People’s Republic of China is 
known to be pursuing the development of 
molten salt reactor technology based on a 
thorium fuel cycle. 
(4) Thorium itself is not fissile, but fertile, 
and requires a fissile material to begin a nu-
clear chain reaction. 
(5) Uranium-233, derived from neutron ab-
sorption by natural thorium, is the ideal 
candidate for the fissile component of a tho-
rium reactor, and is the only fissile material 
candidate that can minimize the production 
of long-lived transuranic elements, which 
have proven a great challenge to the geo-
logic disposal of existing spent nuclear fuel. 
(6) Geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
from conventional nuclear reactors con-
tinues to pose severe political and technical 
challenges, and costs the United States tax-
payer more than $500,000,000 annually in 
court-mandated awards to utilities. 
(7) The United States possesses the largest 
inventory of uranium-233 in the world, aggre-
gated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) it is in the best economic and national 
security interests of the United States to re-
sume development of highly efficient tho-
rium molten-salt reactors that can minimize 
transuranic waste production, in consider-
ation of the pursuit by the People’s Republic 
of China of thorium molten-salt reactors and 
associated cooperative research agreements 
with United States national laboratories; 
(2) that the development of highly efficient 
thorium molten-salt reactors is consistent 
with section 1261 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232; 132 Stat. 2060), 
which declared long-term strategic competi-
tion with the People’s Republic of China as 
‘‘a principal priority for the United States’’; 
and 
(3) to resume such development, it is nec-
essary to preserve as much of the uranium- 
233 remaining at Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory as possible. 
(c) PRESERVATION
AND STORAGE
OF URA-
NIUM-233.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Energy 
shall seek every opportunity to preserve sep-
arated uranium-233, with the goal of fos-
tering development of thorium molten-salt 
reactors by United States industry. 
(2) DOWNBLENDING AND DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN 
URANIUM.—The Secretary may provide for 
the downblending and disposal of uranium- 
233 determined by industry experts not to be 
valuable for research and development of 
thorium molten-salt reactors or technology 
implementation. 
(d) INTERAGENCY COOPERATION.—The Sec-
retary of Energy, the Secretary of the Army 
(including the head of the Army Reactor Of-
fice), the Secretary of Transportation, the 
Tennessee Valley Authority, and other rel-
evant agencies shall— 
(1) work together to preserve uranium-233; 
(2) if necessary, expedite transfers of ura-
nium-233 between the Department of Energy 
and the Department of Defense; and 
(3) seek the assistance of appropriate in-
dustrial or medical entities. 
(e) REPORT REQUIRED.—Not later than 180 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to 
the congressional defense committees a re-
port that includes the following: 
(1) Details of the separated U-233 inventory 
that is most feasible for immediate or near- 
term transfer. 
(2) The costs of constructing or modifying 
a suitable category I facility for the secure, 
permanent storage of the U–233 inventory. 
(3) A pathway for National Asset Material 
designation.

f 
NOMINATION OF SAULE OMAROVA 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to spend a few minutes talking 
about the President’s nominee to be 
Comptroller of the Currency and her 
recent comments on those of us who 
were asking questions about her back-
ground, because they are pretty out-
rageous, and I think it is time. In some 
ways, we need to put an end to this no-
tion that you can’t criticize someone 
for their ideas without being charged 
with things like, maybe, racism, which 
kind of gets me a little bit riled up, 
since I think I was one of the targets of 
her remarks. 
I have been down on the floor talking 
about some of the nominees that this 
administration has put forward. Some 
are so radical, far left. 
The 
ATF 
nominee 
was 
actually 
against the Second Amendment. He got 
withdrawn. 
The 
BLM 
Director 
was 
an 
ecoterrorist. She got voted in. Now she 
is in charge of 60 percent of my State— 
remarkable. I think a lot of Senators 
are going to regret that vote. 
And now we have a nominee to be the 
Comptroller of the Currency: Saule 
Omarova. She is charged with char-
tering, regulating, and supervising all 
national banks—a really important po-
sition, for a capitalist economy, in par-
ticular. 
There is a problem, though, Mr. 
President. It doesn’t seem like she 
much likes banks or, for that matter, 
the free market or, for that matter, 
capitalism or the financial system in 
America. So Senators have been com-
ing down to the floor and in com-
mittee, asking questions, doing our due 
diligence on this nominee. I want to 
commend Senator TOOMEY, in par-
ticular, who has been doing that, and I 
have been joining him. 
So I am going to talk a little bit 
more about her background and her 
ideas, which, by the way, have nothing 
to do with her race or her sex—noth-
ing. I just want to know what her ideas 
are. So I am going to talk a little bit 
about that. 
A 1989 graduate of Moscow State Uni-
versity, where she received the Lenin 
Personal Academic Scholarship—that 
is the Vladimir Lenin Personal Aca-
demic Scholarship. And from what we 
know about her writings, yes, she was 
raised in a communist country. That is 
nothing against her. But sometimes 
you get notions of capitalism, social-
ism, communism, Marxism. And her 
writings are something that are of in-
terest to the committee—certainly to 
me, certainly to Senator TOOMEY— 
about what she believes in terms of the 
financial 
system, 
socialism, 
com-
munism. 
Here is what she tweeted in 2019, just 
2 years ago: Until I came to the U.S., I 
couldn’t imagine things like the gender 
pay gap still existed in today’s world. 
Say what you want about the old 
USSR, but there was no pay gap there. 
Markets don’t always work best. 
That is a tweet 2 years ago. Say what 
you want about the old USSR, about 
Stalin and Lenin and the roughly 100 
million 
people 
killed 
during 
their 
reign. Say what you want about the old 
USSR, the famine, the human degrada-
tion, the ill-fated, violent attempts to 
snuff out freedom and liberty, there 
and all across the world. 
She clarified: I never claimed men 
and women were treated absolutely 
equal in every facet of the old Soviet 
Union. But people’s salaries were set 
by the state in a gender-blind manner. 
Those things are still a pipe dream in 
American society. 
I mean, listen to her. This is just 2 
years ago, still talking about the gold-
en days of the USSR. 
There was gender equity, all right. 
Both sexes starved equally, and if you 
complained, you were sent to Siberia, 
regardless of if you were a man or a 
woman. 
But her nostalgia for socialist, com-
munist policies doesn’t end with pay 
disparities. She has advocated for ex-
panding the Federal Reserve’s mandate 
to include the Federal Reserve people’s 
ledger she has written about—a peo-
ple’s ledger. 
By separating the lending function 
from the monetary function, the pro-
posed reform that she has talked about 
will effectively ‘‘end banking as we 
know it.’’ This was written in 2014, as a 
professor. These are radical, radical 
ideas. These are ideas, and this person 
is supposed to be charged with being in 
charge of the financial system of 
America—capitalism. 
Some of us still believe in capitalism 
here. Some don’t. 
But it is OK to question these ideas. 
She has put them out there. 
The ranking member of the banking 
committee has asked for a copy of her 
thesis. 
Now, 
every 
member 
going 
through confirmation in the Senate is 
supposed to give up any writings that 
she had. This used to be on her CV 
until a couple of years ago. Then she 
deleted it. It is called ‘‘Karl Marx’s 
Economic Analysis and the Theory of 
Revolution in The Capital.’’ 
So Senator TOOMEY
has asked for 
that. She is required to give it. And, as 
of now—this is a letter I would like to 
have printed in the RECORD. This is Oc-
tober 5. Senator TOOMEY asked for this. 
She still hasn’t responded and provided 
it. She is required to. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8056 
November 4, 2021 
U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON BANK-
ING, HOUSING, 
AND
URBAN
AF-
FAIRS, 
Washington, DC, October 5, 2021. 
Ms. SAULE OMAROVA, 
Professor, Cornell Law School, 
Ithica, NY. 
DEAR MS. OMAROVA: For the Senate Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs to fully assess the fitness of individuals 
to serve in Senate-confirmed executive and 
independent agency positions, the Com-
mittee requires nominees to submit all 
‘‘books, articles, reports, and other published 
materials [one has] written.’’ 
Therefore, I write today seeking a copy of 
your thesis, ‘‘Karl Marx’s Economic Analysis 
and the Theory of Revolution in The Cap-
ital,’’ which you wrote as a student at Mos-
cow State University on the V.I. Lenin Per-
sonal Academic Scholarship. While it ap-
pears that you have deleted any reference to 
your thesis in the version of your curriculum 
vitae (CV) that is currently available on the 
Cornell Law School website, the paper ap-
peared on your CV as recently as April 2017. 
Given that your thesis was written while 
you were a student at Moscow State Univer-
sity in the late 1980s, I assume that it was 
written in Russian and will require trans-
lation. To ensure there is adequate time for 
translation and review by lawmakers, my 
Committee staff reached out to both you and 
staff at the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC) requesting a copy last 
month. Unfortunately, we have not received 
any assurances that the Committee would 
receive a copy of the paper in a timely fash-
ion. 
Accordingly, I formally request that you 
provide a copy of the original Russian-lan-
guage thesis to the Committee, along with 
an English version if one exists, no later 
than the close of business on October 13, 2021. 
Thank you for your attention to this mat-
ter. 
Sincerely, 
PAT TOOMEY, 
Ranking Member. 
Mr. 
SULLIVAN. 
But 
again, 
Mr. 
President, these are ideas. These are 
her ideas. It is very fair for U.S. Sen-
ators to ask for these things, to evalu-
ate these things. 
Do we want someone who doesn’t be-
lieve in the financial system and cap-
italism in charge of American banks? I 
don’t. 
So I would like to learn more. And so 
we have been pressing. That is our job. 
That is our job. So she hasn’t re-
sponded to Senator TOOMEY. 
As I mentioned, in a reference to a 
2014 book entitled ‘‘The End of Bank-
ing,’’ she wrote: ‘‘By separating their 
lending function from their monetary 
function, the proposed reform’’—for the 
Fed—‘‘will effectively ‘end banking’ as 
we know it.’’ 
That is a really interesting, radical 
idea. That is 2014. These are her ideas. 
These are her ideas. 
And if there is any doubt about her 
continued interest in Marxist ideology, 
it was recently reported that she joined 
a Facebook group called ‘‘Marxist 
Analysis and Policy,’’ which, according 
to the group, ‘‘stand[s] for the self- 
emancipation of the working class and 
Socialism.’’ 
Recent—this is recent. This wasn’t 
when she was at old Moscow State Uni-
versity—recent. She has not said that 
story was wrong about her Facebook 
group. So we can only assume it is 
true. 
Did she join that group to espouse de-
mocracy and the free market? Here are 
the group’s rules: ‘‘Support for the 
Tory party is not acceptable. A culture 
of diverse Marxist, Socialist and rad-
ical views is the framework for the 
group.’’ 
Again, these are ideas—radical ideas, 
socialist ideas—that are coming from 
the woman who has been nominated by 
the President of the United States to 
be in charge of all the banks, the 
Comptroller of the Currency, a really 
important job. 
So we have been asking about this. 
We have been asking about this. We 
want to see her writings. This is com-
pletely legitimate that the American 
people want the Senate to be doing 
this—advice and consent. What do you 
really think? Do you believe in cap-
italism? Do you believe in banks? You 
want to end banking as we know it? 
Well, how is that going to work if you 
are Comptroller of the Currency? 
So we are asking for these things, 
asking for her thesis. 
Then, Mr. President, sadly, because I 
think Americans are finally getting 
tired of this, she was asked about this 
Republican criticism. It is legitimate 
criticism. And the quote was, well, ‘‘I 
am an easy target’’—this is quoting 
from 
her 
now—‘‘an 
immigrant, 
a 
woman, a minority.’’ 
And asked if she thought if some of 
the criticism of her that I am just de-
scribing—I am one of the critics—was 
criticism based on her critics being 
‘‘racist,’’ she said, ‘‘I think that is 
true.’’ 
So here is my point, Mr. President. I 
think the American people are getting 
a little tired of this. I think the Amer-
ican people are getting a little tired of 
this. I and other Senators have been 
asking very legitimate questions about 
this woman’s beliefs, about what is in 
her head, about how would she be the 
Comptroller of the Currency. 
And the response is, from her: My 
critics are ‘‘racist.’’ 
Let me be a little more blunt. This is 
patently absurd. The U.S. Senators are 
allowed to ask questions—sometimes 
pointed questions—of nominees. The 
Presiding Officer certainly has done 
that in his career, and I respect that. 
But every time someone asks a point-
ed question, if you come back and say, 
‘‘Well, they are doing it for these nefar-
ious reasons, like racism,’’ it really 
doesn’t advance the discussion now, 
does it, especially here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate? 
I really hope my colleagues here, 
whether you are a Democrat or Repub-
lican, can maybe tell the nominee: 
Hey, don’t do that again. 
Right? 
Don’t do that again. 
These Senators are asking—I think I 
am asking—very legitimate questions; 
like, No. 1: Do you believe in cap-
italism? Do you believe in the financial 
system of America? You are going to 
be put in charge of it. 
I think it is quite legit to ask her 
that. 
Her writing indicates she doesn’t. 
This nominee has some very troubling 
views. We are allowed—in fact, we are 
required—to fully vet nominees. And 
calling Senators racist or sexist for 
doing so—this vetting—is actually a 
disgraceful tactic that they might have 
used in the Soviet Union, that they 
might have used at Moscow State Uni-
versity, in other eras, to silence voices, 
but it is not going to work here on the 
Senate floor. 
So the nominee needs to drop that 
tactic. You are not going silence me. 
You are not going to silence Senator 
TOOMEY. And I would just say this 
more generally—and we all know it, 
and we all feel it: Americans—men, 
women, Black, White, Brown, Native, 
non-Native—people are starting to get 
tired of this tactic that, when you 
criticize someone on their beliefs, they 
try to silence you or cancel you or end 
the discussion by bringing out ‘‘you are 
the racist’’ criticism. Let’s not do that 
here. 
This nominee needs to come forward, 
needs to answer questions, needs to 
provide us with her thesis, which is 
about her beliefs on socialism and cap-
italism, and we are going to continue 
to do our business in the vetting. 
But I can tell you, I am one Senator 
who is not going to be silenced by a 
woman who is being criticized—the 
nominee; it doesn’t matter if it is a 
woman or man—who is being criticized 
for very legitimate reasons and then 
turns around and tries to slander her 
critics. It is not going to work. As a 
matter of fact, I think it is going to 
make it much harder for this nominee 
to be confirmed. 
I hope my colleagues look hard at her 
record, and I hope those who are advis-
ing her tell her to tone it down. Those 
tactics might work in the Soviet 
Union, which she seems to have a lot of 
affection for still, but they are not 
going to work in the United States of 
America, and they are really not going 
to work in the Halls of the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor.

MARTIN F. MCKERNAN, JR., ESQ. 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, after 
years of demonstrated dedication and commit-
ment to his community and country, we cele-
brate the life and achievements of Martin F. 
McKernan, Jr. Devoted to his family, faith, and 
the law, Martin McKernan, Jr. had an immeas-
urable impact on all who knew him. A devout 
Roman Catholic, Martin F. McKernan, Jr. was 
named a knight of St. Gregory by Pope John 
Paul II and carried his faith and values with 
him in all his endeavors. He was a beloved 
uncle, brother, son, friend, and colleague. 
Born and raised in South Jersey, he com-
pleted his undergraduate education at St. Jo-
seph’s University and earned his JD from 
Georgetown University before serving his 
country in the 404th Civil Affairs Battalion of 
the U.S. Army Reserves in Trenton, NJ. Upon 
his discharge, he returned to Camden City to 
serve as the City Attorney and went on to hold 
numerous prestigious positions to the benefit 
of his community. 
Martin McKernan, Jr. served in numerous 
roles and capacities, some of which include 
legal counsel to the Diocese of Camden, a

New Jersey, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court; an 
original trustee of the Camden Center for Law

HONORING ANTHONY TATE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious gentleman, Mr. Anthony Tate. An-
thony has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication, and a desire to 
achieve. 
Anthony Tate is a Chicago native, Yazoo 
City resident and graduate of Yazoo City High 
School. Tate has been employed at Mis-
sissippi State Hospital (MSH) for over 11 
years and is a Mental Health Technician work-
ing in Forensic Services. 
Anthony has been named MSH August Em-
ployee of the Month for Direct Care. The MSH 
Employee of the Month award recognizes em-
ployees who have made outstanding contribu-
tions to the hospital through their work. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Anthony Tate for his 
passion and desire to serve others. 
REMEMBERING LISA SANDOMIR 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and mourn the loss 
of Lisa Sandomir. Ms. Sandomir was a long-
time Phoenix-area educator and principal of 
Maurice C. Cash Elementary School for the 
past sixteen years. She passed away trag-
ically last week as the result of a car accident. 
Ms. Sandomir was beloved by students, 
parents, and fellow teachers. During her time 
as principal, M.C. Cash was named an A+ 
School of Excellence and, in 2015, she was 
awarded the prestigious Rodel Exemplary 
Principal award for her leadership. Ms. 
Sandomir believed in creating a positive envi-
ronment where every student was given the 
opportunity to succeed and often reminded her 
students to never stop believing in them-
selves, just as she never stopped believing in 
them. 
My thoughts are with Ms. Sandomir’s family, 
the students and staff of M.C. Cash Elemen-
tary School, and the entire Laveen community 
during 
this 
difficult 
time. 
Although 
Ms. 
Sandomir will be greatly missed, her legacy 
will be carried on through the thousands of 
students whose lives she touched.

RESOLUTION RELATED TO CUBA, 
H. RES. 760 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, on Novem-
ber 3, 2021, I inadvertently voted in favor of H. 
Res. 760 when I intended to vote against it. 
Even though the resolution passed by a large 
margin in the House of Representatives, I op-
pose this resolution and am disappointed it 
passed the House. 
Let me be clear: I strongly support those in 
Cuba who are protesting against the repres-
sive and anti-democratic Cuban regime, and I 
support this resolution’s sentiment in solidarity 
with Cubans who are demonstrating peacefully 
for fundamental freedoms. 
However, this resolution is flawed and does 
not present real solutions for Cuba or its peo-
ple. It completely ignores the U.S.’s decades- 
long failed policy toward Cuba and fails to ac-
knowledge the negative impact that this failed 
U.S. policy has had on the Cuban people. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I have 
worked with my colleagues to change the dec-
ades-long failed U.S. policy toward Cuba. 
Among the goals I’ve worked toward are lifting 
the ban on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba and 
lifting the restrictions on selling food and medi-
cine to Cuba. I have supported legislation that 
would achieve these goals. 
I was also a supporter of former President 
Obama’s proposals to allow U.S. companies 
to establish banking relations, ease travel re-
strictions, and export some goods including 
agricultural products—and I strongly oppose 
former President Trump’s reversal of these 
Obama-era policies. 
At the beginning of President Biden’s ad-
ministration, I joined several of my colleagues 
in urging President Biden to take executive ac-
tion to reverse the Trump administration’s 
wrong-headed policies toward Cuba, return to 
the Obama administration’s diplomatic pro-
posals, and pursue an end to the nearly six- 
decade-long economic embargo of Cuba. 
As a longtime supporter of reviewing our 
country’s position on Cuba, I will continue to 
support reform efforts.

HONORING BREAST CANCER 
SURVIVOR MS. LATANIA DODD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a resilient indi-
vidual and breast cancer survivor, Ms. Latania 
Dodd. 
Ms. Latania Dodd, CEO of Dodd Consulting 
Co. in Itta Bena, MS, is a certified Community 
Health Worker with Cross Roads Clinic under 
the governance of Delta Regional Health Cen-
ter in Greenville, MS. Her ongoing aspiration 
is evidenced in her passionate outreach work 
in supporting the health needs of people 
throughout the Delta communities. 
Ms. Dodd’s career path of Community 
Health Worker aligns with her work experience 
in years past, as Director of Community En-
gagement with the University Medical Center/ 
Patient Center Outreach Research Institute, 
SPOIV Regional Diabetes Coordinator with the 
Mississippi State Dept. of Health Office of Pre-
vention, and worked as a volunteer with The 
Fannie Lou Hamer Cancer Foundation of 
Ruleville, MS under the leadership of CEO 
Freddie White. 
She has studied at Mississippi Valley State 
University, Jackson State University, Mis-
sissippi State University, South Eastern Ca-
reer and Vocational School, and Lamar Med-
ical Institute. Ms. Dodd has several certifi-
cations, including Clinical Medical Assistant, 
Direct Care Nurse, Phlebotomist, Certified 
Lifestyle Coach, Community Health Worker, 
and Community Health Advisor and Trainer. 
She is the mother of Dezmond A. Dodd, her 
teenage son, the daughter of the late Willie C. 
Dodd, her loving and supportive father, and 
her mother, Bertha L. Dodd. In 2020, with the 
onset of COVID–19, Ms. Dodd was faced with 
two of the most devastating challenges in her 
life—a diagnosis of Stage IIb In Situ Car-
cinoma Breast Cancer and the loss of her fa-
ther at the same time. It was the toughest bat-
tle she has ever encountered, but her faith in

God and her fighting spirit sustained her 
through the double mastectomy with recon-
struction and chemotherapy treatments. 
Ms. Dodd is a cancer survivor, as of Feb-
ruary 4, 2021. Her desire is to help support 
other young women in their battle with breast 
cancer by sharing her story and her belief: 
‘‘You Can Do This; We Can Do This To-
gether!’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Latania Dodd for her 
resilience and willpower despite obstacles 
such as breast cancer.

GWENDOLYN A. FAISON 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, Gwen-
dolyn A. Faison was a Clinton, North Carolina 
native, but has called Camden home for most 
of her life. A loving mother and grandmother, 
Faison dedicated her life to her family, city 
and her country. 
Mayor Gwendolyn A. Faison retired with 27 
years devoted to public service. Faison was 
first elected to the Camden City Council in 
1983. Two years later she became a member 
of the Camden County Board of Commis-
sioners, and in 1997 she would become the 
first female African-American Camden City 
Council President. 
Mayor Faison’s commitment to serving her 
city and country did not stop there. She would 
be elected as the first female African-Amer-
ican Mayor of Camden, New Jersey in the De-
cember of 2000. Her term began on July 1, 
2001. She won reelection in 2005 and served 
until 2010.

RECOGNIZING FIRST LIEUTENANT 
GRANT HAXTON 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize U.S. Army First Lieutenant Grant 
Haxton for his bravery, heroism, and service 
to our country. I had the distinct pleasure of 
meeting Grant when he interned in my Wash-
ington, D.C. office in spring 2018. 
Grant is an infantry platoon leader with the 
82nd Airborne Division, which was deployed in 
August to the Hamid Karzai International Air-
port in Kabul, Afghanistan as the Taliban 
closed in on the city. He and his fellow sol-
diers helped secure the perimeter of the air-
port for two weeks as they evacuated over 
120,000 Americans, Afghan allies, and other 
vulnerable people to safety. After weeks of 
selfless dedication to the mission, Grant left 
on one of the last transport planes out of 
Kabul. It is thanks to heroes like Grant that 
our military was able to coordinate one of the 
largest airlifts in history. 
Grant is a 2015 graduate of La Can˜ada 
High School, just outside of my congressional 
district. He was a member of Boy Scout Troop 
509 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and 
achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in 2014. As 
a student at the University of Wisconsin— 
Madison, Grant served as a legislative intern 
in my Washington, D.C. office. Through this 
position, he helped respond to constituents 
over the phone and through mail, greeted visi-
tors in the front office, conducted tours of the 
U.S. Capitol, and assisted my legislative team 
with research and administrative support. He 
is remembered fondly by my staff for his dili-
gent work, sense of humor, and passion for 
public service. 
I commend Grant for his dedication to his 
community and to his country. I am fortunate 
to have had such a selfless public servant on 
my team, and I am proud to see all of Grant’s 
incredible accomplishments since his time in 
my office.

IN MEMORY OF MABEL KEHINDE 
SODEINDE 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and contributions of Mabel 
Kehinde Sodeinde of Arlington, Texas. 
Mabel was a diligent, respectful, and intel-
ligent young woman who lit up the lives of all 
those around her during the twenty-three 
years that she spent on this earth. Mabel was 
a proud 2017 high school graduate of the Up-
lift Summit International Preparatory and then 
went on to study at Texas Tech University in 
Lubbock, Texas. During her time at Texas 
Tech University, Mabel held multiple leader-
ship positions and graduated magna cum 
laude with dual degrees in both political 
science and history and numerous honors in 
2021. 
My office and I had the privilege of getting 
to know Mabel as a congressional intern in 
our office in early 2020. She was a great 
member of our team who worked with both 
our staffers and the other interns to serve the 
people of Texas’ 33rd District. 
Most recently, Mabel was focused on mak-
ing a difference in the world and advancing 
civil rights through continuing her education as 
a first-year student at the Northwestern 
Pritzker School of Law. 
Her loss is devastatingly painful for her fam-
ily, friends, and all of us who had to privilege 
to know her during her time on Capitol Hill. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with her loved 
ones. We will miss her dearly.

RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ENVIVA FACILITY 
IN AHOSKIE, NORTH CAROLINA 
HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 10th anniversary of the 
Enviva’s flagship facility in Ahoskie, North 
Carolina, in my congressional district. 
Enviva produces renewable wood bioenergy 
from low-value and residual wood. For the 
past decade, Enviva has grown to become a 
valued and trusted member of the community. 
The Ahoskie facility has created over 300 jobs 
and has an economic footprint of $160 million 
per year in the area. In total, Enviva has gen-
erated 1,800 jobs and nearly $1 billion in eco-
nomic output through their four production fa-
cilities and port terminal in North Carolina. 
Enviva’s sustainable forestry practices help 
fight climate change, strengthen rural commu-
nities, create well-paid jobs, and contribute to 
the health and vitality of North Carolina’s be-
loved forests. It supports North Carolina’s for-
estry industry, purchasing low-grade wood and 
forestry residuals that would otherwise go to 
waste or rot in the fields. Their work connects 
the citizens of my district in the global effort to 
reduce energy derived from coal and mitigate 
climate change. 
Madam Speaker, Enviva’s contributions to 
the First District and the entire state of North 
Carolina have been profound. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the 10th an-
niversary of Enviva’s flagship 
facility 
in 
Ahoskie, North Carolina.

CELEBRATING CONEY ISLAND’S 
100TH YEAR IN BUSINESS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Coney Island’s 100th year in busi-
ness. Coney Island was founded in 1921 by 
brothers 
Paul 
and 
George 
Nickolpolous. 
Through many changes of ownership over the 
years, Coney Island has remained a staple in 
the Galesburg community. Current owners 
Maria Valdez and her son, Jesus Valdez, have 
operated Coney Island since 2004. Each day, 
the restaurant serves up its famous Coney Is-
land pork hot dogs with brown mustard and 
onions, covered in beef sauce. The topsecret 
recipe has remained largely the same over the 
years and the grill and dining counter are the 
originals from 1921. I commend Coney Island 
for its 100 years serving customers. 
It is because of strong businesses such as 
Coney Island in Galesburg, Illinois that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to again formally congratulate Coney Is-
land on its 100th Year in business.

Wayne County Clerks from 2001 to 2003 and 
was nominated for Clerk of the Year in 2021. 
As City Clerk, Mrs. Lehr was responsible for 
some of the most important duties of local 
government. Tasked with keeping the journal 
of city meetings and commissions, she dili-
gently attended city gatherings and kept the 
public up to speed on the issues of the day. 
The face of elections in the City of Gibraltar, 
Clerk Lehr and her team work tirelessly to en-
sure the accuracy and integrity of the city’s 
elections, spending tens of hours counting 
votes and submitting tallies. 
A friendly face to city visitors and residents 
alike, Clerk Lehr—known as Cindy to friends— 
has been helping Gibraltar residents vote and 
maintain important records for nearly three 
decades. An active volunteer, Mrs. Lehr is a 
23-year member of the International Rotary 
Club. A loving mother and grandmother, Mrs. 
Lehr and her husband Paul have 7 children 
and 18 grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Clerk Cynthia Lehr for her ex-
emplary 26 years of service to the City of Gi-
braltar, Michigan. She will be missed at Gibral-
tar City Hall, but I join with Cindy’s family, 
friends, and colleagues in extending my best 
wishes to her in retirement.

IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE 
LYNMORE JAMES 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to a de-
voted Man of God, a distinguished public serv-
ant, dedicated husband, loving father, inspiring 
mentor, and dear friend of longstanding, The 
Honorable Lynmore James. Sadly, Lynmore 
transitioned from labor to reward on Friday, 
October 29, 2021. His funeral service will be 
held at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, November 6, 
2021, at the Macon County High School Gym 
in Montezuma, Georgia. 
Lynmore James was born on August 28, 
1937, in Byromville, Georgia to the union of 
the late Mr. Will James and Mrs. Hannah 
James Johnson. A product of the Macon 
County School System, he graduated from 
Flint River Farms School, before going on to 
receive his Bachelor of Science degree in 
Building Construction from Tuskegee Univer-
sity in Alabama. Lynmore was a very success-
ful farmer in Macon County and a valued team 
leader in the Quality Control Division at Ford 
Motor Company. 
He served in the General Assembly of 
Georgia for nine terms from 1992 through 
2010. While proudly serving as the State Rep-
resentative for House District 135, he served 
on several House Committees including Agri-
culture & Consumer Affairs, Appropriations, 
Regulated 
Industries, 
and 
Retirement. 
Lynmore was actively involved in improving 
the quality of life and local economies for his 
constituents in Dooly, Peach, Talbot, and Tay-
lor Counties. 
But Madam Speaker, his commitment to 
public service did not end there. Lynmore was 
more than a legislator, he was a servant to all 
humankind. He gave of himself to countless 
causes and organizations including the Flag 
Bank Board of Directors, the Flint River Com-
munity Hospital Governing Board, the Georgia 
Center for Youth Advisory, the Georgia Agri- 
Leaders Forum, the Fort Valley State Univer-
sity Foundation Board, and Alpha Phi Alpha 
Fraternity, Incorporated. Dr. Maya Angelou 
once said that ‘‘I’ve learned that you shouldn’t 
go through life with a catcher’s mitt on both 
hands; you need to be able to throw some-
thing back.’’ Lynmore threw a prodigious 
amount of love and service back to the com-
munities and state he loved so dearly. 
Lynmore accomplished much in his life, but 
none of this would have been possible without 
his enduring faith in God, and the love and 
support of his wife of 49 years, Faye Hardrick 
James; his sons Lynorris, Mack Carlton, and 
Jefferey; and a host of other family, friends, 
and associates, all of whom will miss him 
deeply. 
On a personal note, Lynmore James was a 
dear friend to me. He was elected to the 
Georgia General Assembly the same year that 
I was called to serve in the U.S. Congress, 
and we represented the same constituencies 
during his service. We bonded over helping 
our constituents, especially during the flood of 
1994 when many of them were displaced and 
disadvantaged because of the natural disaster. 
The advice, counsel, friendship, and support 
that I received from Lynmore as Congressman 
for the Second Congressional District was im-
measurable. He never told me what I wanted 
to hear, but he always told me what he felt I 
needed to hear. 
Lynmore was truly a great state representa-
tive for Middle Georgia and a stellar example 
of how a public servant should serve his con-
stituents. His friendship, leadership, and coun-
sel will be sorely missed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of Georgia’s Second Congres-
sional District, in honoring the life and legacy 
of The Honorable Lynmore James for his re-
markable service to humankind. Moreover, we 
extend our deepest condolences to Lynmore’s 
family, friends, and all those who grieve his 
loss, during this period of bereavement. We 
pray that they will be consoled and comforted 
by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the 
weeks, months, and years ahead.

HONORING THE VILLAGE 
RESTAURANT 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community grocer, The Village Restaurant— 
TGS Community Quick Shop. 
The Village Restaurant originally opened in 
1986 in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. A true fam-
ily-owned business is now owned and oper-
ated by brothers and sisters—Dr. Marvel Tur-
ner (a CPA by trade), head cook Deloris Tur-
ner Daughrity and manager, Dorothy Turner 
Griffith. When the business was started in the 
mid-1980’s, six Turners were involved along 
with three siblings—they included mother, Alla 
Fair Turner (now deceased), brother Allen Tur-
ner and Etta Turner Simpson, who just re-
cently passed away in January. Deloris and 
Dorothy manage to take turns in the kitchen, 
and they currently have six employees on staff 
to help them prepare food. The front of their 
business is a grocery/convenience store, and 
the back section is where the restaurant is lo-
cated. They sell a variety of meats, fruits, 
vegetables and produce. Their store is really a 
‘‘full-service’’ type of restaurant. 
Recalling the history of The Village Res-
taurant (which was first known by the initials 
T.G.S.), Deloris Daughrity said her mother, 
Alla Fair, lived across the street from its cur-
rent location in the 80’s. At that time, the 
building was vacant because the previous ten-
ant had gone out of business. Their mother 
did not want the vacant building to become a 
nightclub or a loud bar in the community, so 
she and Marvel got together and bought the 
building. The Village Restaurant was started 
with the money she had saved up. Their jour-
ney began as a convenient store—cooking 
burgers, chicken, fish, french fries and other 
food items. Then it grew into a full-fledged res-
taurant. Eventually, Deloris left her job in Jack-
son where she worked at the old Hancock 
Fabric store to come and help in 1986. Addi-
tionally, Dorothy and Etta were schoolteachers 
and would come in to work after they finished 
their day jobs. 
After thirty-five (35) years, The Village Res-
taurant remains the archetype icon and central 
foundation of a family business that retains 
devotion, commitment, and encouragement for 
generations to come. 
It is with honor to commend the vision of 
such a remarkable and successful family busi-
ness as The Village Restaurant ‘‘TGS’’, which 
still serves the community through service and 
commitment that has sustained Turner family 
throughout this journey, and whose venture is 
a testament to God’s promise of success and 
longevity to those who diligently seek Him and 
obey His will. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing The Village Restaurant— 
TGS Community Quick Shop for their passion 
and desire to serve others.

HONORING UNITED STATES ARMY 
SPECIALIST 
4, 
GEORGE 
OSBORNE, JR. 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I take this 
time to remember one of Northwest Indiana’s 
heroes, United States Army Specialist 4 (SP4) 
George Osborne, Jr., who was killed in action 
in Vietnam on November 22, 1967. On this 
upcoming Veterans’ Day, SP4 Osborne will be 
recognized with a special tribute, and I join 
Mayor Jerome Prince and the citizens of Gary, 
Indiana, in honoring his service. courage, and 
sacrifice. 
George Osborne Jr. was born on January 
30, 1948, in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, to 
George and Virginia Osborne. Throughout his 
youth, George was an avid drummer with his 
school’s band, and he took a special interest 
in automobiles and electronics, the latter of 
which influenced his decision to join the mili-
tary. Following his graduation from William H.

Holtzclaw High School, located in his home-
town of Crystal Springs, in May 1966, George 
relocated to Gary, Indiana. There he worked 
for a short time at Inland Steel before enlisting 
in the Army on November 29, 1966. 
After completing his required training, SP4 
Osborne’s tour in Vietnam commenced on 
May 20, 1967. He is remembered for his com-
mitment toward the ideals of freedom for all 
and for his concern for those with whom he 
fought. During his time in Vietnam, SP4 
Osborne made a great impact on his fellow 
soldiers, one of whom would later contact his 
family to tell the story of the day George 
saved his life. Tragically, on November 22, 
1967, while transporting a mortar round, it ex-
ploded, and SP4 Osborne sustained a fatal 
fragment wound. While there is great sorrow 
in his young life being lost that day, SP4 
Osborne’s service and sacrifice will forever be 
remembered by a proud community and a 
grateful nation. 
Following his death, SP4 Osborne was post-
humously awarded the Military Merit Award. 
For his service and sacrifice, he is also a re-
cipient of numerous awards including the Pur-
ple Heart, Air Medal, Army Commendation 
Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Viet-
nam 
Campaign 
Medal, 
Vietnam 
Service 
Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Combat Infantry-
man Badge, Vietnamese Merit Medal, and the 
Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. 
George is remembered fondly by his friends 
and family. He is survived by his brothers, 
Herbert, Glen and Robert Osborne, and his 
sister, Georgia Osborne-Davis. He was also 
the cherished son of George Sr. and Virginia, 
and the beloved brother of Melvin Wilson, Will 
Osborne, Lula Osborne, and Lois Osborne- 
Kemp, all of whom have passed on. 
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you 
and my other distinguished colleagues join me 
in honoring a fallen hero, SP4 George 
Osborne, Jr. SP4 Osborne is a true patriot 
who fought not only for his country but for the 
freedom of all people. He made the ultimate 
sacrifice and will forever remain a hero to his 
family and friends, to his community, and to all 
those for whom he served. Thus, let us never 
forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the 
ideals of freedom and democracy.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF MARY INA JONES 
HENDLEY 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of 
Mary Ina Jones Hendley. 
Ina was born November 25, 1921, to Fisher 
and Mary Griffin Jones, a farming family in 
South Georgia. One of 14 children, her family 
depended on her to help with childcare and 
their farm. Her father was a carpenter and 
businessman, so she also helped in the family 
store. Ina graduated high school the top of her 
class in Nashville, Georgia. 
Like her father, she was proficient in mathe-
matics. She worked for a local agricultural 
manufacturer until marrying her high school 
sweetheart, Willard Hendley. Willard served 
proudly in the United States Navy during 
World War II, in the Pacific theater. They lived 
in several port areas during the war. Later 
they returned to raise their two daughters in 
Nashville. 
Ina and Willard assumed leadership roles, in 
the community and their church. Accounting 
was Ina’s interest and she completed courses 
that led to work as a finance officer at Moody 
AFB, Valdosta, Georgia. She continued her 
education through off-campus courses offered 
by Troy University and attained a BS in Busi-
ness. She also earned an MBA from Valdosta 
State University. After her daughters left 
home, Ina accepted a position as Payroll Su-
pervisor at Patrick AFB, in Satellite Beach, 
Florida. 
They witnessed rocket launches near Cape 
Canaveral and enjoyed having their grand-
children observe these historic events. When 
she retired at 70, her coworkers gave her a 
signed photo of the space shuttle. After retir-
ing, Ina was a caregiver for Willard. During 
this time, Ina worked towards a Religious Edu-
cation degree, including time as an extension 
student with New Orleans Baptist Seminary. 
She completed several mission trips with her 
church teaching English as a Second Lan-
guage. 
In her early 80’s, Ina returned to her home-
town of Nashville and sang in church choir, 
helped at the food bank and served as a ‘‘Pink 
Lady’’ at the hospital and nursing home. 
In 2013, she moved to be near her second 
daughter and resides in Alexander City, Ala-
bama. Ina attributes her health to being active; 
loving to walk, exercise and read. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Ina and wishing her a very happy 100th 
birthday.

RECOGNIZING RECOVERY 
LIGHTHOUSE 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an amazing group, Recov-
ery Lighthouse in Warrensburg, Missouri. 
Founded in 2006 by Dr. Adriatik Likcani and 
the late Mr. Douglas Quirmbach, the organiza-
tion began as a drop-in counseling center for 
individuals and families in the Warrensburg 
area. Today, Recovery Lighthouse offers out-
patient counseling in Warrensburg and Seda-
lia. The organization also runs five long-term 
sober-living houses, the first of which was 
LIME Tree, a house for women in recovery. 
They now have two houses for women, two 
for women and children, and one for men, with 
another men’s house opening soon. These 
houses give those in recovery a place to con-
tinue their sobriety, hold a job, and build inter-
personal relationships until they are ready to 
live on their own. 
Recovery Lighthouse offers training and de-
velopment courses for their staff to provide 
them with the necessary tools to better under-
stand what it takes to provide treatment and 
recovery support for individuals. This, along 
with partnering with their community to advo-
cate for recovery, are just a few of the ways 
Recovery Lighthouse stays true to their mis-
sion of providing people with as much support 
as possible in a safe and caring environment. 
Recovery Lighthouse is a truly wonderful or-
ganization working to help communities in Mis-
souri’s Fourth Congressional District overcome 
substance-use disorders and provide for them 
a helping hand along the path to full recovery. 
I commend Dr. Likcani and all the staff for im-
plementing such a life-changing program and 
look forward to seeing them impact their com-
munities for years to come.

RECOGNIZING 
WILLIAM 
‘‘BILL’’ 
LIVESAY ON BEING NAMED THE 
2021 ST. CLAIR COUNTY MICHI-
GAN VETERANS COUNCIL VET-
ERAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize William ‘‘Bill’’ Livesay of 
East China, Michigan, on being named the 
2021 St. Clair County Michigan Veterans 
Council Veteran of the Year. Bill was nomi-
nated for this award by the St. Clair County 
Voiture Locale 120, 40et8. 
When you look at Bill’s resume, you won’t 
be surprised why he has been awarded this 
high honor. Bill embodies selfless patriotism 
towards his country and thoughtful service to 
his community. Soon after graduating high 
school, Bill enlisted in the United States Air 
Force in 1965 and trained in Aerospace 
Ground Equipment. He left active duty in 1969 
and enlisted in the Michigan Air National 
Guard, 127th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Soon after in 
1971, the Wing relocated to Selfridge Air Na-
tional Guard Base. 
Bill supported and deployed numerous times 
during operations in Southwest Asia, Kosovo, 
the Iraq campaign, and also served as a mili-
tary advisor to the Latvian Ministry of Defense. 
In January of 1998, he was appointed 127th 
Wing Senior Enlisted Advisor and was then 
appointed Command Chief Master Sergeant. 
In 2000, he was selected as the Michigan Air 
National Guard Command Chief. He retired in 
September 2003 with 38 years, 2 months, and 
23 days of service. During this time, he re-
ceived awards such as the Meritorious Service 
Medal with two Bronze Oak Leaves, Air Force 
Commendation Medal with a Bronze Oak 
Leaf, and the Air Force Achievement Medal 
with a Bronze Oak Leaf. 
After his retirement, Bill was employed by 
the United States Army and assigned to the 
Heavy Tactical Vehicle Division Tank & Auto-
motive Command, in Warren, Michigan. As an 
equipment specialist, he was involved in direct 
support of all Heavy Tactical Vehicles during 
the initial stages of the Afghanistan and Iraq 
conflicts. He finally retired in January 2013 
with more than 47 years of government serv-
ice. 
In retirement, Bill has kept active. He has 
been a member of the American Legion Post 
382 for 17 years, serving as their Post Adju-
tant since 2016. He is also a member of the 
Post Honor Guard and Post Color Guard, and 
since 2014, he has been a member of the St. 
Clair County Veterans Council Honor Guard 
team. There have been over 1,500 veterans’ 
funerals and community ceremonial events in 
which he has performed. Any veteran who has

an issue, should seek out Bill; he has been a 
constant promoter of veterans’ programs that 
highlight available benefits. If he does not 
know an answer, you can be sure he will do 
all he can to find the answer. 
It is an honor to recognize such a great 
American. Bill has dedicated his life to this 
country and its veterans. It is my hope that Bill 
recognizes the enormous impact he has had. 
The example he has set will be followed for 
years to come. I congratulate Bill on this honor 
and I thank him for his service. I wish him 
many more years of dedicated and selfless 
service.

HONORING 
THE 
75TH 
INACTIVA-
TION 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
65TH INFANTRY 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, today, I 
commemorate the 75th Inactivation Anniver-
sary of General George S. Patton’s 3rd Army, 
65th Infantry Division. 
The 65th Infantry Division was activated on 
August 16, 1943, at Camp Shelby, Mississippi 
under the command of Major General Stanley 
E. Reinhart. Upon completion of their training, 
the soldiers of the 65th Infantry Division were 
transported by train to Camp Shanks, New 
York and departed via troop ships on January 
10, 1945, for combat in Europe. In the face of 
severe aggression from Germany, they were 
transported aboard ships from England to a 
barely functional France. The 65th Infantry Di-
vision set up Camp Lucky Strike despite ex-
tremely harsh winter conditions and low supply 
and food rations. During the Second World 
War, this unit fulfilled its motto of ‘‘Right to Be 
Proud’’ as they fought their way to victory. The 
soldiers traveled a total of 850 miles from Le 
Havre, France, to Enns, Austria. 
The soldiers of the 65th Infantry Division 
have been awarded numerous honors for their 
heroism and valor in battle. They received the 
Congressional Medal of Honor, 7 Distin-
guished Service Crosses, 11 Legion of Merits, 
67 Silver Stars, 4 Soldier Medals, 690 Bronze 
Stars, and 19 Air Medals. 
On August 31, 1945, the 65th Infantry Divi-
sion was inactivated. A few years later, vet-
erans of the unit held annual reunions to pro-
vide support and encouragement to their com-
rades in arms and to remember those who 
made the ultimate sacrifice and did not make 
it home. 
They were just young men when they put 
aside their hopes and dreams to answer our 
nation’s call. Today, on behalf of the 4th Con-
gressional District I am honored to recognize 
the heroes of the 65th Infantry Division on 
their 75th Inactivation Anniversary ceremony. 
They are truly members of the greatest gen-
eration. 
ISABELLA ROSE DORIAN 
MEMORIAL 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, Isa-
bella Rose Dorian was born in Houston, 
Texas, on October 8, 1941, to Mannis Dorian 
and Annie Cormier Dorian. Isabella’s parents 
instilled in her a strong work ethic, leading her 
to become the first member of her family to 
pursue higher education. Isabella attended 
Texas Southern University before transferring 
to and graduating from the University of 
Texas—Medical 
Branch 
in 
Galveston 
(‘‘UTMB’’) with a Bachelor of Science in phys-
ical therapy. 
With encouragement from her uncle and 
Godfather, Louis Dorian, Isabella began her 
career as a physical therapist by serving those 
in need in the Fifth Ward community. Isabella 
rejoiced in her work, taking pride in helping 
patients recover in ways they scarcely could 
have imagined when they received their initial 
prognosis. While working at the St. Elizabeth 
Hospital, Isabella reunited with a onetime col-
lege suitor, Eugene Edwards, who had be-
come a pharmacist. The pair married in 1976 
and would go on to raise two daughters, Val-
erie and Ananda. Isabella and Edward instilled 
their shared values of hard work and service 
to others in Valerie and Ananda. Isabella’s 
daughters pursued careers in television and 
filmmaking, as well as law and public service, 
each making her immensely proud. 
Isabella is survived by her daughters, Val-
erie and Ananda Edwards; her granddaughter, 
Dylan Rose Beavers; her niece, Shandra 
Mason; her great-niece; her great-nephew; her 
brother-in-law 
and 
a 
loving 
community. 
Isabella’s passion for service and education 
were an inspiration to all who met her. She 
will be dearly missed.

RENACER ACT, S. 1064 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, on Novem-
ber 3, 2021, I voted Present on S. 1064, the 
Reinforcing Nicaragua’s Adherence to Condi-
tions for Electoral Reform (RENACER) Act of 
2021. 
Let me be clear: I strongly oppose Nica-
raguan dictator Daniel Ortega and his repres-
sive and antidemocratic regime. The ills of 
Ortega’s authoritarian regime are manifold. Or-
tega and his cronies have intimidated or ar-
rested virtually all potential political opposition 
in the country. Ortega has engaged in numer-
ous human rights abuses, and he has en-
riched himself and his allies while decimating 
the Nicaraguan economy and its people. 
While I sympathize with this legislation’s in-
tent to crack down on Ortega and his cronies, 
it’s not clear that the legislation as written 
would effectively achieve these aims. Instead, 
the legislation’s text appears to require broad- 
based sanctions that could contribute to fur-
ther economic collapse in the country, nega-
tively impact the Nicaraguan people, exacer-
bate a migration crisis, and further consolidate 
Ortega’s grip on power. 
This legislation also did not go through the 
normal legislative process in the House. In-
stead of receiving scrutiny through the tradi-
tional committee and amendment process, this 
legislation was put on the floor last-minute as 
a suspension without adequate input from 
Members or the House Financial Services 
Committee—which I understand had signifi-
cant reservations with the legislation’s text. 
As we’ve seen in other countries where the 
U.S. has engaged in broad-based sanctions, 
these types of sanctions do not always 
achieve their intended result. When appro-
priate, I support smart, targeted sanctions that 
limit adverse effects on civilian populations. 
Unfortunately, this legislation—and the lack of 
adequate legislative scrutiny—does not meet 
that standard.

END PALM OIL DEFORESTATION 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘End Palm Oil Deforestation 
Act,’’ which would incentivize all palm oil prod-
ucts imported into the United States to be cer-
tified by credible third-party standards for law-
ful, ethical, and sustainable sourcing of palm 
oil like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil. My bill would also prohibit American tax-
payer dollars from funding destructive prac-
tices or forced labor for palm oil cultivation. 
As President Biden stated this week in his 
address at the 2021 United Nations Climate 
Change Conference—known as ‘‘COP26’’— 
tropical forests worldwide are a significant car-
bon sink increasingly lost to deforestation. The 
United States and all countries must act as re-
sponsible stewards of this resource. 
Unsustainably cultivated palm oil—used in a 
variety of food products, cosmetics, and 
biofuels—is one of the primary drivers of trop-
ical deforestation worldwide. Remarkably, im-
ported palm oil has virtually no requirements 
under federal law to demonstrate that it is cul-
tivated and harvested sustainably or even le-
gally in the country of origin. At the 40th Ses-
sion of the International Civil Aviation Organi-
zation (ICAO) Assembly in 2019, the global 
aviation sector committed to transition towards 
the use of advanced biofuels. As the commer-
cialize airline industry makes this transition to 
purportedly ‘‘sustainable aviation fuels,’’ the 
global demand for palm oil is only set to in-
crease. That is why we must act immediately 
to ensure that only sustainably and ethically 
sourced palm oil is be sold in the United 
States. 
My ‘‘End Palm Oil Deforestation Act’’ would 
establish a preference under federal law for 
imports of certified sustainable palm oil and 
palm oil products. It would also require that all 
palm oil products, whether food, cosmetics, or 
fuel, bear a label stating their country of origin, 
allowing American consumers to make in-
formed decisions. In addition, my bill would re-
move palm oil from eligibility under the grand-
fathered facility clause of the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel 
Standard (RFS) under which unsustainable,

foreign-sourced palm oil is allowed into the 
RFS program. Congress always intended for 
the RFS to support domestic biofuel produc-
tion, not imports. 
I appreciate that oil palm trees have the po-
tential to provide efficient, low-carbon oil, but 
the United States must take a stand against 
human rights abuses and destructive cultiva-
tion practices that set us back in our efforts to 
combat climate change and global deforest-
ation. American foreign relief, including financ-
ing provided under the World Bank and Inter-
national 
Monetary 
Fund, 
cannot 
support 
unsustainable practices, enable foreign corrup-
tion, or contribute to forced labor, child labor, 
or the displacement of indigenous peoples. 
Madam Speaker, the United States must 
ensure that palm oil imports are grown in a 
lawful, sustainable, ethical, and responsible 
manner. I urge all Members to join me in co-
sponsoring the ‘‘End Palm Oil Deforestation 
Act.’’

CELEBRATING 40 YEARS OF 
PHOENIX PRIDE 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 40th annual Phoenix 
Pride Festival and Parade which will take 
place on November 6th and 7th. Each year, 
this event brings together Arizonans, enter-
tainers, vendors, and community resources to 
celebrate and uplift members of the Arizona 
LGBTQ+ community and to further Phoenix 
Pride’s mission of creating a more diverse, in-
clusive, and equal Arizona. 
In addition to celebrating the 40th anniver-
sary of Phoenix Pride, I would also like to rec-
ognize and thank the Phoenix Pride Commu-
nity Foundation which has given over $1 mil-
lion in contributions since its creation. The 
Phoenix Pride Community Foundation sup-
ports the work of non-profits serving the 
LGBTQ+ community in Arizona through its 
grants programs and helps LGBTQ+ students 
and allies achieve their dreams of higher edu-
cation through its scholarship program. 
Since its founding in 1981, Phoenix Pride 
has been a beacon of hope and acceptance 
for the Phoenix LGBTQ+ community. Thanks 
in part to the hard work of Phoenix Pride, 
Phoenix ranks among the most LGBTQ+- 
friendly cities in the state, with protections 
against discrimination and a strong, involved 
LGBTQ+ 
community. 
While 
significant 
progress has been made in recent years, 
Phoenix Pride continues to tirelessly work to 
combat homophobia, transphobia, and dis-
crimination in Arizona and across the country. 
I would like to again congratulate Phoenix 
Pride on their 40th Festival and Parade, thank 
them for their work to make Phoenix a more 
inclusive and just city, and wish them all the 
best on another 40 years. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER 
VIRGINIA GOVERNOR, LINWOOD 
HOLTON, JR. 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I take this time to remember 
former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton Jr., 
who passed away on October 28, 2021. 
Linwood was the state of Virginia’s first Re-
publican governor elected post-Reconstruc-
tion, and his tireless efforts for political co-
operation between the two parties led to 
progress that would impact not only the Com-
monwealth, but the entire nation. 
Linwood’s love for politics was sparked at a 
young age. In high school, he was involved in 
a mock government program that was run 
through Virginia Tech. It was at this point that 
Linwood realized his long-term goal in life was 
to serve as governor of Virginia. He then 
began his studies at Washington and Lee, but 
in 1943, he entered the Navy as an engineer-
ing officer, serving with the Submarine Force. 
After the war, Linwood finished his under-
graduate degree at Washington and Lee and 
was admitted to Harvard Law School, where 
he graduated in 1949. 
Throughout Linwood’s time as Governor 
from 1970 through 1974, he was a champion 
for civil rights that led the effort to end racial 
discrimination in Virginia. He was the first gov-
ernor of Virginia to appoint black individuals to 
high-level government posts. He also led by 
example during the integration of public 
schools in Virginia, when he sent his children 
to schools being integrated. 
Linwood’s life was filled with patriotism and 
public service. Linwood believed in two-party 
cooperation, often reaching across the aisle to 
consider and enact state-wide policies that 
would benefit Virginians. He will be missed for 
his passion for change, but his impact will live 
on. 
He is survived by his wife Virginia, his four 
children, Anne, Tayloe, Woody, and Dwight, 
and several grandchildren. His son-in-law, 
Senator Tim Kaine, continues his legacy of 
public service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me and 
countless others as we recognize the many 
contributions of Linwood Holton, Jr.

MAYOR 
JAMES 
GORRIS’ 
16 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE TO THE CITY OF GI-
BRALTAR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mayor James Gorris on the 
occasion of his retirement after over 16 years 
of service to the City of Gibraltar, Michigan. 
His significant contributions to the Gibraltar 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Born in Wyandotte, Michigan and a grad-
uate of Lincoln Park High School, Mayor 
James Gorris is a downriver native. He was 
first elected to his position in 2009 and was 
reelected 6 more times until his retirement. 
Before becoming Mayor of Gibraltar, he 
served the community as a member of the Gi-
braltar City Council. 
During his tenure as Mayor, Mayor Gorris 
has improved the lives of Gibraltar residents in 
many ways. He has led the way in obtaining 
grants for investments in infrastructure, includ-
ing the replacement of the bridge over Middle 
Gibraltar Road, a path for walkers and bikers 
along the boundary of the Detroit International 
Wildlife Refuge, and the City’s renewal of the 
water system. Mayor Gorris has worked close-
ly with stakeholders on the multimillion dollar 
plan to renovate and repurpose the old 
McLouth Steel Plant. 
All who know him can attest to his strength 
of character and commitment to making Gi-
braltar a better place for all. Mayor Gorris 
credits his success to the hard work and dedi-
cation of city employees, the city council, and 
Gibraltar’s police and fire departments. His 
strong relationships within his own community, 
as well as with state, local, and federal lead-
ers made him a stellar advocate for the excep-
tional place that he calls home. Mayor Gorris 
and his wife Tamey have four grown children 
and they reside in Gibraltar. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mayor James Gorris for his ex-
emplary 16 years of service to the City of Gi-
braltar, Michigan. I join with Jim’s family, 
friends, and colleagues in extending my best 
wishes to him in retirement.

DOD JOINT TASK FORCES TO SUP-
PORT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGEN-
CIES 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce legislation to make permanent and 
expand the U.S. Department of Defense’s au-
thority to use funds from the counterterrorism 
and drug interdiction budgetary account for 
federal interagency Joint Task Forces. 
These DOD Joint Task Forces coordinate 
the military and federal agencies on counter-
narcotics, 
counterterrorism, 
or 
counter- 
transnational organized crime activities. United 
States Africa Command (AFRICOM) and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service use this Joint 
Task Forces funding authority to conduct anti- 
trafficking and poaching activities in Sub-Sa-
haran Africa. As the former Deputy Secretary 
of the Interior during the Clinton Administra-
tion, I strongly support USFWS’s International 
Affairs Program and wildlife conservation work 
globally, particularly by that agency’s law en-
forcement officers. 
Since first authorized by the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 
(Public Law 108–136), Congress has renewed 
the authority for these Joint Task Forces sev-
eral times on a temporary basis. Without Con-
gressional action in the NOAA, this authority 
will sunset at the end of fiscal year 2022. As 
chairman of the House Armed Services Sub-
committee on Readiness, I plan to make per-
manently reauthorizing this critical authority a 
priority during the FY2022 NOAA conference 
negotiations. 
In the House-passed FY2020 NOAA (Public 
Law 116–92), I secured directive report lan-
guage on the military’s support for combating 
illicit trafficking, including wildlife and wildlife 
products. Making the authority for these Joint 
Task Forces permanent builds upon that work. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to continue 
working with my colleagues on the House 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
to 
support 
AFRICOM’s efforts with other federal agencies 
to combat wildlife trafficking and poaching.

KEN KLEIN RETIREMENT 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in recognition of the retirement of Ken 
Klein, who has served as the Executive Vice 
President for the Out of Home Advertising As-
sociation of America (OAAA) for the past two 
decades. During his time at OAAA, Ken has 
driven the billboard industry into a new era of 
public service. 
Ken spearheaded the OAAA’s public-service 
partnerships with various agencies and non-
profits—including the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation (FBI), Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency (FEMA), and the National Center 
for 
Missing 
and 
Exploited 
Children 
(NCMEC)—to seek new ways to inform and 
protect Americans. 
The FBI partnership is an excellent example 
of how law enforcement, the private sector, 
and the public can collectively bring criminals 
to justice in today’s digital age. As a result of 
Ken’s efforts, the FBI has new tools to pro-
mote safety and rapidly share information in 
dangerous situations. 
The collaboration and the speed with which 
digital billboards can publicize crucial fugitive 
and crime-related information was key to the 
success of numerous investigative efforts in 
2020. For example, outdoor advertising helped 
nab the ‘‘Travelling Bandit’’—a serial bank rob-
ber—in 2019 and raised awareness on a noto-
rious drug cartel fugitive in 2020 after the indi-
vidual was added to the FBI’s ‘‘Ten Most 
Wanted Fugitives’’ list. All in all, the FBI cred-
its the capture of 58 fugitives as a direct result 
of billboard publicity. 
Digital billboards have also proved to be a 
vital tool in disaster preparation and response. 
A case study posted on FEMA’s website re-
ports that, ‘‘Digital technology enables quick 
delivery of emergency messages via high-tech 
billboards. Public-private partnerships harness 
these high-tech signs to inform the public 
about weather warnings, evacuation routes, 
and safety-related information.’’ 
Advances in technology mean that the bill-
board industry can deliver information in ways 
unavailable a generation ago. The message 
on a digital billboard can be changed by com-
puter in an instant: 
On August 1, 2007, the I–35W Bridge col-
lapsed in Minneapolis. Within 15 minutes, 
emergency messages were displayed on dig-
ital billboards throughout the area. 
After Tropical Storm Fay in August of 2008, 
37 different messages were displayed on 
more than 75 digital billboards in 11 counties 
in Florida. 
When Albuquerque experienced a natural 
gas emergency, the city quickly posted mes-
sages on digital billboards asking the public to 
lower thermostats and reduce hot water 
usage. 
Immediately after the massive Japanese 
earthquake in 2011, tsunami warnings ap-
peared on digital billboards on the West 
Coast. 
Finally, Ken also led a partnership with the 
NCMEC. Because of his hard work, more than 
500 AMBER Alerts have been displayed on 
digital billboards across the country. Law en-
forcement and NCMEC rely on these high- 
tech signs to help locate missing children and 
to apprehend child abductors. 
Please join me in extending congratulations 
to Ken, on the occasion of his retirement, for 
his successful leadership of OAAA’s public-pri-
vate partnerships, and his contributions to 
public safety.

Thursday, November 4, 2021

Blackburn Middle School, Mrs. Thomas was 
recognized for moving each school from their 
underperforming status to a level of satisfac-
tory progress. She has been selected as the 
High School Division’s Administrator of the 
Year for two years. She led student participa-
tion in Jackson State University’s statewide 
S.T.E.M. Team Competition with Lanier High 
School and Provine High School winning first 
place, both years of participation. Additionally, 
the Jackson City Council awarded her the 
Amos Wright Award for community involve-
ment and superior academic performance in 
2012 and 2020, and the Outstanding Leader-
ship in Education Award in 2016. She has 
also received numerous accolades from fac-
ulty, staff, and student organizations in rec-
ognition of her leadership, loyalty, and service 
in public education. 
Mrs. Thomas prides herself on keeping her 
life in balance with a strong commitment to 
God and a loving family. She is married to 
Jonathan Thomas, Sr. and they have two 
sons, the late Jonathan, Jr. and Jonah Thom-
as. Mrs. Thomas strongly believes that 
schools are ‘‘A Building With Four Walls and 
Tomorrow Inside’’.

HON. CHERI BUSTOS

Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Marla Clay on her retirement 
following 27 seasons as coach of the Gales-
burg High School Volleyball Team. 
Marla started coaching the Silver Streaks

JONATHAN W. JERNIGAN 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, after 40 
years of culinary experience, Chef Jonathan 
W. Jernigan will be remembered fondly as a 
true pillar of his community. Jonathan Jernigan 
began his career in cooking with a job at 
McDonalds, going on to then graduate from 
The Restaurant School of Philadelphia, work 
at Cherry Hill’s Greenbrier Restaurant and 
Camden’s Harbor League Club before arriving 
at Cathedral Kitchen. 
Jonathan W. Jernigan’s impact as the Exec-
utive Chef at Cathedral Kitchen has been im-
measurable—from launching a culinary arts 
training program that has prepared over 400 
graduates for careers, to dedicating his efforts 
to support and feed people who suffered from 
food insecurity. He played an integral role and 
was present for all 23 graduating classes of 
the 17-week culinary arts training program, 
aimed at those who are unemployed or at risk 
of homelessness. 
Chef Jernigan remained a key contributor to 
the Cathedral Kitchen until July 2020, when he 
chose to pursue owning a food truck. His gen-
erous presence was felt regardless of his loca-
tion, as he was remembered to have loaned 
money, extra meals, and advice to those who 
needed it. His character followed him wher-
ever he went and left an irreplaceable impres-
sion on those he met. 
HONORING GILBERT GEORGE 
PROSEK 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Gilbert George Prosek, a 
World War II hero who lost his life in the Pa-
cific Theater in 1944. Gilbert was born Octo-
ber 1, 1921, to George and Theresa Prosek of 
Chester, IL. He was known to his friends and 
family as ‘‘Gib,’’ and he was familiar for his 
happy-go-lucky perspective on life. Gilbert lost 
his father when he was five years old, with he 
and his mother looking after one another until 
she remarried to Ben Sebastian. Gilbert had 
three half-sisters: Helen, Shirly, and Joyce. At 
16 years old, Gilbert took a job at the Prim 
Hosiery Knitting Mill. He enlisted in the Ma-
rines at 21, in 1942. The last time most of Gil-
bert’s family saw him was at his going away 
party, the day he left for basic training. After 
receiving a Private First Class ranking, Prosek 
was stationed on Cape Gloucester, New Brit-
ain Island. There, he made three charges 
across a stream to put an enemy gunman out 
of action and provide covering fire for another 
member out of his platoon. During this act of 
heroism, Gilbert’s position was exposed and 
he lost his life. His family was awarded the 
Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism and de-
votion to duty. Madam Speaker, please join 
me in honoring Gilbert George Prosek of 
Chester, IL, as we mark 100 years since his 
birth. On behalf of Southern Illinois, we thank 
him and his family for their selfless sacrifice in 
defense of our freedoms.

HONORING NETTY SEARD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a resilient indi-
vidual, Mrs. Netty Seard. 
Netty Ransome Seard was born in the city 
of Greenville, Mississippi, along with her four 
sisters and one brother to Ralph and Martha 
Ransome. Netty graduated from O’Bannon 
High School in 1994 and went on to pursue a 
Bachelor of Arts Degree in Speech Commu-
nications, Masters of Criminal Justice, and 
Masters of Social Work all from Mississippi 
Valley State University. 
Netty spent fourteen years at the Mississippi 
Department of Employment Security where 
she helped thousands to secure employment 
and attend college through the Workforce In-
vestment Act Program. In 2015, Netty became 
a Court Administrator in the Fourth Circuit Dis-
trict of Mississippi. 
Netty is no stranger to her community. She 
believes in Greenville. She has worked tire-
lessly throughout her adult life being involved 
in many projects that help women, men and 
children have a better quality of life. 
Netty’s community service and affiliations in-
clude: 
President of the Greenville (MS) Alumnae 
Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. 
2016–2020; 
Past President Board of Directors Greenville 
Arts Council (also served as secretary and 
treasurer); 
Ambassador Greenville Area Chamber of 
Commerce; 
Past Sub-Chapter President for the Inter-
national Association for Workforce Profes-
sionals; 
Past Chairperson United Way Housing Ini-
tiative Committee; 
Past Member of MS Alliance for State Em-
ployees-CWA Local 3570; 
Member of St. Matthew AME Church, Past 
YPD Director and Women’s Missionary Soci-
ety; 
Past President of the Parent-Teacher Asso-
ciation for Trigg Elementary School (2012– 
2014);

Past Member of the Board of Directors for 
the Greenville/Washington Co. Historic Preser-
vation Commission; 
36th Mississippi Delta Blues and Heritage 
Festival-Volunteer of the Year Award 2013; 
and 
Greenville Girls Rock Community M.A.G.I.C. 
(Making A Great Impact in the Community) 
Award. 
Netty says when she is serving others or 
volunteering, she is never thinking if someone 
is watching or what others are thinking of her. 
She only focuses on the recipient of the serv-
ice, and hopefully, the positive impact her help 
will make in that person’s life. 
She thanks God for giving her the strength 
and tenacity to unselfishly serve others and 
become a change agent in the community. 
She also thanks her husband, Mr. Mark K. 
Seard for being so understanding, caring, and 
supportive of her ideas and aspirations. And, 
last but certainly not least she thanks her 
sweetheart, Madison Marie for sharing her 
mommy’s time with others, so that Greenville 
may become a better place for her to live and 
grow. Her only hope is that she is watching 
and taking notes from Mommy. 
Netty’s favorite quote is from Colin Powell, 
‘‘A dream doesn’t become reality through 
magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard 
work!’’ Her daily prayer is that she can con-
tinue this path and leave a positive mark for 
years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Netty Seard for her 
passion and desire to serve others.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
UNKNOWN SOLDIER 
HON. CHIP ROY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, November 11, 
2021 marks the 100th Anniversary of the 
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. On this date, 
one hundred years ago, the first body of an 
unknown soldier was laid to rest in the Tomb 
of the Unknown Soldier. The soldier died in 
World War I on the fields of France. He was 
brought home with honor. A representative for 
every American service man and woman who 
have served or will serve and have paid the 
ultimate price as ransom for our freedom. 
The Unknowns buried in the graves adja-
cent to the Tomb are no less honored and no 
less remembered. They are the nameless who 
bear all names. They are the dead who will 
rest forever, guarded by the men and women 
of the watch, the Sentinels of the 3rd United 
States Army Infantry Regiment, also known as 
the Old Guard. 
New York Congressman Hamilton Fish, Jr., 
a World War I veteran, proposed the legisla-
tion that authorized the construction of the 
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. 
The Major James Kerr Chapter, National 
Society Daughters of the American Revolution 
from Kerrville, Texas is honored to Com-
memorate the 100th Anniversary of the Tomb 
of the Unknown Soldier on November 11, 
2021. We unanimously pledge our devotion to 
the American soldier, both to those who cur-
rently serve and to those who have been in-
volved in past armed conflict so that others 
might remain free. They are gone but will 
never be forgotten. 
The Major James Kerr Chapter, NSDAR 
therefore asks that citizens remember on No-
vember 11, 2021 that the Unknowns who are 
buried in the Tomb of the Unknowns represent 
all men and women who have died in the 
service of their country.

Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize Graveraet Elementary 
School of Marquette, Michigan, for being se-
lected as a National Blue Ribbon School by 
the U.S. Department of Education. Through 
their dedication to their students and the local 
community, Graveraet Elementary has be-
come an indispensable part of the Upper Pe-
ninsula and the State of Michigan. 
For 39 years, the National Blue Ribbon 
Schools Program has set out to recognize the 
exceptional efforts of schools around the U.S. 
who symbolize the gold standard for teaching 
and learning. Through their longtime devotion 
to education and academics, Graveraet Ele-
mentary School continues to go above and 
beyond for their students and perfectly exem-
plifies Yooper values on the national stage. To 
help their community adapt to a modernizing 
society, Graveraet invested in Chromebook 
and iPad programs that bring crucial tech-
nology to all of their students regardless of 
their background. The school also offers sev-
eral other critical programs such as One 
School One Book, which organizes assem-
blies and luncheons each month with the Prin-
cipal. Graveraet and their staffs tireless com-
mitment has positively changed the lives of 
countless families and students. The impact of 
their work cannot be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late the Marquette community and Graveraet 
Elementary School for being named a National 
Blue Ribbon School. With the many difficulties 
our schools have faced this past year, their 
dedicated service has created a positive and

in. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
Graveraet Elementary School all the best in its

HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Drew Hall for winning the IHSA 
Class 1A State Championships for Golf. 
Drew Hall first picked up a golf club 15 
years ago, and with his skills on the green and 
the support of his family, he won first place at 
the IHSA State Championships. Drew re-
corded a 36-hole score of 144 at state and 
now joins Rockridge boys’ golf history as one 
of the only state champions in golf in 
Rockridge High School history. At the end of 
the season, Hall’s 3-under par 68 at River-
dale’s Wayne Brinkmeier Invitational tied the 
18-hole record and was the third of his three 
tournament titles. He also won gold at the 
Monmouth-Roseville Invite and Kewanee’s 
Boiler Invite. As a former athlete, I commend 
the determination and hard work Drew has 
shown this season. I am proud to see him rep-
resent his community so well throughout the 
state with his dedication and passion for golf. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Drew Hall that I am especially proud to serve 
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Drew Hall for winning the IHSA 
Class 1A State Championship in golf.

HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 4, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I was unable 
to vote on H.R. 3193—E-BRIDGE Act. Had I 
been able, would have voted YEA on this leg-
islation. This is a strong bipartisan bill that I 
am proud to support, which will help bring 
needed Economic Development Administration 
grants to rural communities—helping complete 
that ‘‘last mile’’. As a member of the Rural 
Broadband Task Force, I am always working 
to see Congress pass legislation that will help 
connect more of our rural communities with 
the internet.
