Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2020 
No. 198 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of Heaven and Earth, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House as they return to their home dis-
tricts. For the first time in our lives, 
families will be gathering, or not gath-
ering to celebrate what we have to be 
thankful for as Americans. We are so 
aware of what we have lost. Have 
mercy on us. 
We do thank You, and thank all 
those in our country who have labored 
through these months to provide serv-
ices to our communities, to teach our 
children, to care for our sick. In these 
seasons of gathering, keep us safe, and 
help us to be mindful of so many who 
have not the benefits we enjoy as 
Americans. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
4(a) of House Resolution 967, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. EVANS led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
PHILADELPHIANS NEED MORE 
COVID RELIEF NOW 
(Mr. EVANS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, my 
constituents in Philadelphia need more 
COVID relief now. Many of them are 
worried or scared, but the Republican 
Senate is still focused on confirming 
more Trump judges. 
The House passed the Heroes Act, 
which gives us more of what we need, 
an extension of the $600 of weekly un-
employment subsidy, not more Trump 
judges; 
Urgent relief for small businesses 
like restaurants, not more Trump 
judges; 
Emergency rental assistance and pro-
tection from eviction or foreclosure, 
not more Trump judges; 
Help for airline workers, not more 
Trump judges; 
Funding, testing, tracing, treatment 
to crush the virus and reopen safely, 
not more Trump judges. 
I urge the Senate to pass the Heroes 
Act now. 
f 
CONGRATULATING JIM GALLOWAY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate and 
honor Jim Galloway on his retirement 
from The Atlanta Journal-Constitu-
tion. 
He most recently served as AJC’s po-
litical columnist and has been a writer 
and editor there for over 41 years. 
Jim knows Atlanta like the back of 
his hand, and he covered some of its 
most prominent figures and events. 
He was responsible for creating the 
AJC’s Political Insider Blog, which is 
one of the south’s most influential po-
litical news sites. 
Starting in 1992, Jim led the news-
paper’s Presidential coverage. He also 
covered various topics on religion, and 
even led the AJC foreign desk. 
I am thankful for Jim’s many years 
of dedication to reporting in an honest 
and balanced manner, and I wish him 
the best as he begins his retirement. 
f 
AMERICA NEEDS TARGETED 
ASSISTANCE 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, nearly 8 
months ago, our lives changed dramati-
cally due to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
With cases surging across the country 
and in Minnesota, the devastation to 
our small businesses is significantly in-
creasing. 
Main Street businesses are the back-
bone of our local economies. They 
bring value to our communities and to 
our lives. We must act with urgency to 
support those most impacted by this 
pandemic. 
We have legislation to do this. My 
bill, the Prioritized Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, would allow small busi-
nesses with 100 or fewer employees who 
have sustained significant losses due to 
COVID–19 to receive a second PPP 
loan. 
In addition, we need to provide tar-
geted assistance to specific industries. 
I 
have 
cosponsored 
the 
RES-
TAURANTS Act and Save our Stages 
Act, which would create grant pro-
grams so our restaurants and inde-
pendent entertainment venues can sur-
vive these unprecedented and unpre-
dictable times.

I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether behind a bipartisan relief bill to 
protect our small businesses and local 
economies.

ONE MORE THING TO BE 
THANKFUL FOR 
(Mr. MARSHALL asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, bells 
should be ringing today, and I just 
don’t mean on Wall Street. Across the 
entire Nation, bells should be ringing. 
Today, as I have been promising 
since early summer, not one but two 
vaccines will ask the FDA for emer-
gency use authorization. 
Congratulations to President Trump. 
Congratulations 
to 
Vice 
President 
PENCE and his Warp Speed team. Con-
gratulations to Pfizer and BioNTech. 
You did it. American innovation has 
persevered again. 
We have three million doses right 
now, enough to vaccinate every nurs-
ing home patient in America. We will 
have 50 million doses by December 
being distributed, as well. 
Thanks to almighty God who in-
spired the scientists who led to the dis-
covery. 
Indeed, bells will be ringing across 
America this Thanksgiving. We have 
one more thing to be thankful for.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL 
PHILANTHROPY DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a founder 
of the Service Organization Caucus to 
celebrate National Philanthropy Day, 
an opportunity to recognize and cele-
brate the many acts of kindness and 
service that individuals and organiza-
tions across this Nation do each day. 
Serving others has always been a pas-
sion of mine. From being a volunteer 
firefighter to being involved in scout-
ing, I have always believed it is my 
duty to give back. 
Service plays a key role in sup-
porting and uplifting our communities. 
The amazing service and philanthropic 
organizations across the Nation that 
give countless hours serving others and 
doing their part deserve a big thank 
you. 
I am honored to co-chair the Service 
Organization Caucus with my colleague 
and friend, Congressman PANETTA of 
California. 
I encourage everyone to do their part 
in honor of National Philanthropy Day. 
To my colleagues, I invite you to join 
me on this service caucus where we can 
work together from both sides of the 
aisle to promote and to support our 
local volunteer service organizations.

AMERICANS NEED RELIEF 
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to urge my col-
leagues and leadership in Congress to 
reach a compromise and pass much- 
needed relief as our country continues 
to respond to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The dramatic rise in cases and deaths 
are alarming and require a strong and 
urgent response from the Federal Gov-
ernment to continue supporting our 
local response across this country. 
We must extend critical unemploy-
ment assistance to the thousands of 
Granite Staters who have lost their 
jobs and will see their benefits expire 
the day after Christmas. 
We must provide relief for our State 
and local governments that have spent 
millions of dollars responding to this 
pandemic and are facing devastating 
budget shortfalls when the legislature 
reconvenes in January. 
Small 
businesses, 
especially 
res-
taurants, continue to face the negative 
economic consequences of this pan-
demic, and Congress must renew crit-
ical portions of the bipartisan CARES 
Act that served as a lifeline for our 
business community. 
The House has already passed two 
comprehensive pieces of legislation, 
and I was proud to support these bills. 
We need to see real action and leader-
ship from the Senate and the outgoing 
Trump administration to get the job 
done.

RECOGNIZING THE DAHL 
BROTHERS 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize two senior air-
men, brothers from south Jersey whose 
commitment to this country and their 
family embody all that makes America 
so amazing. 
Thomas ‘‘Jeff’’ Dahl, Jr., and Charles 
Dahl are the sons of Lieutenant Colo-
nel Tom and Jennifer Dahl. 
Jeff joined the New Jersey Air Force 
National Guard in January 2018 as a 
fuel systems apprentice and currently 
attends Rutgers University in New Jer-
sey. 
Charles Dahl joined the National 
Guard in May 2019 as a munitions as-
sistant apprentice. 
Both men are avid and well-known 
outdoorsmen, and they are committed 
to their community and south Jersey. 
These young men are in the pool to 
deploy with the 177th Fighter Wing in 
2021. This carries on a family legacy of 
combat deployments going back to 
their grandfather, who deployed to 
Korea, and their father, who deployed 
to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Men, you inspire all of us with your 
lives and the future that I know will be 
an inspiration for many others. I was 
happy to crash your party that day and 
get to know you just a little bit better. 
God bless you, God bless what you do, 
God bless your bravery, and God bless 
the United States of America. 
f 
MILLIONS NEED OUR HELP 
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, COVID 
cases in my district are doubling, tri-
pling, or worse. From the D.C. suburbs 
to the rural areas, no part is immune. 
What is it going to take to burst the 
bubble our Senate colleagues are living 
in and wake them up to reality? Be-
cause in this reality, 12 million Ameri-
cans are going to lose their unemploy-
ment benefits next month if we don’t 
act. In this reality, tens of thousands 
of small businesses are on track to 
close their doors for good by the end of 
the winter. 
If our Senate colleagues continue to 
sit on their hands and continue to do 
nothing, then on top of a public health 
crisis and an economic crisis, we are 
also going to have a homelessness cri-
sis as eviction and foreclosure morato-
riums expire. 
Mr. Speaker, I am urging leaders of 
both parties in both Chambers of Con-
gress to come together, and let’s vote

extend the deadline for CARES Act 
funds to be used by States and local-
ities. Let’s continue the eviction mora-

AMENDMENT NO. 9 OFFERED BY MR. LEVIN OF 
MICHIGAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 9 
printed in part B of House Report 116– 
593. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 123, line 14, insert ‘‘, and partner with 
a labor or joint labor-management organiza-
tion’’ after ‘‘partnership’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
first, let me thank Chairman SCOTT for 
his leadership and for bringing this ex-
ceptional reauthorization to the floor 
today. 
Before I begin speaking about this 
amendment, I would like to acknowl-
edge the important role that labor 
unions have played in building the na-
tional apprenticeship system. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the AFL–CIO in support 
of H.R. 8294. 
AFL–CIO, 
Washington, DC, November 19, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The AFL–CIO urges 
you to support the National Apprenticeship 
Act of 2020 (H.R. 8294), scheduled for floor 
consideration later this week. R.R. 8294 rec-
ognizes that Registered Apprenticeship pro-
grams are the ‘gold standard’ in our nation’s 
workforce development system, and we wel-
come this effort to modernize a law that has 
not been meaningfully updated since it was 
enacted 83 years ago. 
Unions and our signatory employers have a 
long history of establishing joint labor-man-
agement partnerships to design and imple-
ment Registered Apprenticeship programs, 
so we have a deep interest in maintaining 
and strengthening our nation’s Registered 
Apprenticeship system. These programs pro-
vide good jobs with good wages and benefits 
that increase as apprentices build their 
skills. They provide a valuable credential 
that can help secure future employment and 
advancement along a rewarding career path, 
and the opportunities they provide are par-
ticularly important for women, people of 
color and veterans. 
H.R. 8294 authorizes significant new fund-
ing to expand registered apprenticeships, 
preapprenticeships, and youth apprentice-
ships in the United States. It would codify 
and streamline existing standards that are 
vital to support apprentices, and would, for 
the first time, include youth apprenticeship 
and pre-apprenticeship programs. The House 
Education and Labor Committee estimates 
that H.R. 8294 will create over 1 million Reg-
istered Apprenticeship opportunities over 
the next 5 years. 
H.R. 8294 would also codify the role of the 
Office of Apprenticeship at the Department 
of Labor, and provide funding streams to en-
sure oversight and technical assistance. Im-
portantly, it would expand Registered Ap-
prenticeship opportunities into new sectors 
of the workforce. The bill also establishes 
standards for state apprenticeship agencies, 
including a requirement that they develop a 
state plan to support Registered Apprentice-
ships and provide technical assistance. Fi-
nally, the bill strengthens the National Ad-
visory Committee on Apprenticeship, ensur-
ing that experts from industry and labor 
have a role in improving the program. 
Registered Apprenticeships are America’s 
most successful federally authorized work-
force development program, employing 94 
percent of those who complete a program. 
H.R. 8294 will help ensure that these pro-
grams meet the highest possible quality 
standards and support family sustaining 
jobs. 
We urge you to support H.R. 8294 including 
Representative Levin’s amendment, which 
encourages partnerships with labor and 
labor-management organizations in Title II 
grant programs, not as a requirement, but to 
the extent practicable, and to oppose any 
amendments that would weaken the bill ap-
proved for consideration by the full House. 
Sincerely, 
WILLIAM SAMUEL, 
Director, Government Affairs. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I wish to emphasize the importance of 
apprenticeship standards that safe-
guard apprentices’ welfare with unions 
who have helped negotiate and protect 
them for many, many years. 
These standards are critically impor-
tant to the success of the national ap-
prenticeship system, which is why I in-
troduced the Strengthening Training 
and Accessibility for New and Diverse 
Apprenticeships through Relevant and 
Dependable Standards Act, or the 
STANDARDS Act for short. 
I am pleased that the National Ap-
prenticeship Act of 2020 incorporates 
my bill, which protects the rights of 
workers who participate in apprentice-
ships. 
The language of this amendment is 
perfectly clear. It says that grant ap-
plicants should partner with an indus-
try or sector partnership and a labor or 
joint labor-management organization 
to the extent practicable. 
Yet, interests hostile to unions are 
once again using scare tactics to claim, 
falsely, that my amendment will pre-
vent industry organizations from se-
curing apprenticeship grants under the 
legislation unless in all cases they 
partner with unions, even when there 
are no unions in the geographic area or 
part of an industry partnership. 
This is not what the amendment 
says. 
Opponents of this amendment are 
bending the truth for ideological rea-
sons. They know, and a plain reading of 
the text makes crystal clear, that this 
amendment does not mandate that 
every applicant partner with a union to 
access grant funding, full stop. It is 
asking them to make reasonable ef-
forts to include unions in the sectors 
and areas where they are carrying out 
an apprenticeship program, again, to 
the extent practicable. 
The National Apprenticeship Act of 
2020 includes the PARTNERS Act, led

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5994 
November 20, 2020 
by Representatives SUZANNE BONAMICI, 
DREW
FERGUSON, SUSAN
DAVIS, and 
BRETT GUTHRIE. That bipartisan legis-
lation—again, included in this act—is 
built around industry or sector part-
nerships, which include unions. 
Despite this, opponents are zeroing in 
on this amendment, saying it discrimi-
nates against apprenticeship programs 
that don’t have union partnerships. 
Trade associations are arguing the 
term ‘‘to the extent practicable’’ is le-
gally ambiguous or could be inter-
preted incorrectly by the incoming 
Biden administration. 
Let’s set the record straight. The 
term ‘‘practicable’’ has been used in 
major legislation for decades. It is in 
the bipartisan Workforce Innovation 
and Opportunity Act, or WIOA, which 
was introduced by the ranking Repub-
lican on the Education and Labor sub-
committee that has jurisdiction over 
it. It is used 10 separate times in the 
bill we are considering. We all know 
what it means. 
The attack on this amendment isn’t 
about the requirements for a grant pro-
gram. It is about the inclusion of the 
word ‘‘labor’’ in a bill to be carried out 
by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
Anyone who reads this amendment 
can see clearly what it does and that 
this fearmongering is about a problem 
that simply does not exist. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment because I am opposed to 
the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, frankly, the amendment of-
fered by Representative LEVIN is a per-
fect distillation of the problems with 
the underlying legislation. 
The amendment limits the grant pro-
gram in the bill so that only entities 
partnering with unions would be eligi-
ble to receive funding, notwithstanding 
what he has said. 
My colleagues across the aisle may 
claim that this is not the case because 
they require union partnership only 
‘‘to the extent practicable.’’ However, 
‘‘to the extent practicable’’ is in the 
eye of the beholder. We have checked 
with CRS, and CRS has said it is pur-
posefully ambiguous. 
Whatever their intent, this is not 
how this provision would be imple-
mented. Even if the ‘‘as practicable’’ is 
implemented as not being a require-
ment, it is certainly suggesting Con-
gress has a strong preference for unions 
and 
organizations 
partnering 
with 
them to receive grant funds. 
This would block countless potential 
participants from accessing these funds 
and would further cement the program 
in the way it has been since the 1930s. 
Unfortunately, Democrats are dou-
bling down on the problems with their 
program and once again are choosing 
to provide benefits to politically fa-
vored unions rather than addressing 
the underlying problems. 
If we want to reach 1 million appren-
ticeships in this country, I fail to see 
how limiting access by creating ear-
marks and kickbacks will achieve that 
goal. 
The majority has said over and over 
again that this bill would create 1 mil-
lion new apprenticeships. That isn’t 
true without this amendment, and it 
will be even less accurate if this 
amendment is adopted. 
It isn’t true because they misunder-
stand the reason that growth in the 
registered apprenticeship program has 
been limited in the past. Businesses 
choose not to participate in registered 
apprenticeships because the govern-
ment already makes it too com-
plicated. Despite my colleagues’ hopes, 
simply authorizing more money cannot 
solve that issue. 
A number of groups have recognized 
the 
problems 
inherent 
with 
this 
amendment and have spoken in opposi-
tion, including the Chamber of Com-
merce, Associated Builders and Con-
tractors, Associated General Contrac-
tors of America, and Independent Elec-
trical Contractors. They understand 
that reaching 1 million apprenticeships 
is not going to happen by turning the 
grant program in the underlying bill 
into a union slush fund. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote against this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
this week, we learned that one of the 
biggest offshore wind developers in the 
world entered into an agreement with 
North 
America’s 
Building 
Trades 
Unions of this country to develop ap-
prenticeships and training programs 
for all the offshore wind development 
that they are going to undertake in the 
oceans off of our East Coast, creating 
thousands of new jobs and fantastic op-
portunities for our young workers to 
learn the latest technology and the en-
ergy production of the future. 
It is such a great example of how ap-
prenticeships and partnerships between 
unions and companies, the biggest 
companies in the world with the latest 
technology, and the whole way the 
economy is moving, is an important 
part of our future. 
This amendment facilitates those ef-
forts. This bill will help our workforce 
zoom into the future, earning while 
they learn and securing jobs that, on 
average, start at $70,000 or more. 
Mr. Speaker, with great enthusiasm, 
I hope everyone votes for this amend-
ment. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, you know what is so sad to 
me is that I am out every week in my 
district talking to job creators and 
businesses who are desperate for work-
ers and who want to create apprentice-
ship programs but will not go through 
the onerous process of the registered 
apprenticeship program. 
Yet, these are the people who are 
paying the taxes, and hardworking 
Americans in those jobs are paying the 
taxes. What the Democrats want to do 
is to transfer hardworking taxpayer 
dollars over to their friends in the 
unions, keeping them solvent. 
We know union membership is down. 
This is a way to boost their member-
ship, by forcing business and industry 
to go into the registered apprenticeship 
program. 
This is wrong. They are not rep-
resenting hardworking Americans who 
want to develop skills for the in-de-
mand jobs. This is the wrong way for 
our country to be going. 
We need to support all types of busi-
ness and industry that wants to help 
people gain the skills that they need 
for the in-demand jobs. 
This amendment is wrong. This bill 
is wrong. We should vote against the 
amendment, 
and 
we 
should 
vote 
against the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I would inquire if I have time remain-
ing or has my time expired. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from Michigan 
has expired. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

the Office of Administrative Law Judges. 
The registration agency shall transmit to 
the Secretary a report containing all perti-
nent facts and circumstances concerning the 
determination, including findings and a rec-
ommendation for deregistration, and copies 
of all relevant documents and records. If the

ducted in accordance with the Office of Ad-
ministrative Law Judges regulations. A 
party to the proceeding may petition for re-
view of the final decision of the Administra-

sponsor or program administrator shall no-
tify each program participant— 
‘‘(A) of such deregistration and the effec-
tive date; 
‘‘(B) that such deregistration automati-
cally deprives the program participant of in-
dividual registration as part of such pro-
gram, including the ability to receive a cer-
tificate of completion from the registration 
agency; 
‘‘(C) that the deregistration of the program 
removes the program participant from eligi-
bility for any Federal financial or other as-
sistance, or right, privilege, or exemption 
under Federal law, that— 
‘‘(i) relates to an apprentice; and 
‘‘(ii) requires the registration agency’s ap-
proval; and

prentices, or apprentices are referred to the 
registration agency for information about 
potential transfers to other programs under 
the national apprenticeship system.

‘‘(2) best practices in increasing underrep-
resented apprenticeship populations’ partici-
pation in programs under the national ap-
prenticeship system; and

ed— 
(1) in the heading, by striking ‘‘FOR JOB

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, since 
March, America’s workers have faced 
unprecedented volatility and uncer-
tainty. Even before that, even before 
the 
pandemic 
when 
unemployment 
rates were at record lows, there was 
still a significant skills gap to close. 
We have a responsibility here in Con-
gress to create real solutions for Amer-
icans, pathways and programs that will 
jump-start and enhance their careers 
and allow them to provide for them-
selves and for their families. 
Knowing all this, I am dismayed that 
we would squander such an opportunity 
as we have today to help Americans in 
need. We have a real opportunity with 
this bill. There is strong bipartisan 
support for apprenticeships in this 
body, and Republicans and Democrats 
both are claiming they want to in-
crease the number of apprenticeships 
available in this country and expand 
apprenticeships into new industries. 
Unfortunately, this bill falls woefully 
short in both of these categories, but I 
have an amendment that would fix 
that. This amendment would fix that. 
This amendment makes necessary im-
provements to achieve the goals of 
modernization and reinvigoration of 
the national apprenticeship system, 
changes that will increase opportuni-
ties for workers and help bolster the 
Nation’s economic recovery. 
Unlike the many hollow claims put 
forward by my colleagues about their 
proposal, this amendment expands the 
number of apprenticeship opportunities 
in the registered model rather than 
permanently limiting them by locking 
in the problems of a decade’s-old sys-
tem. My amendment provides program 
sponsors with the necessary resources 
and freedom to effectively instruct ap-
prentices on the job. 
While the underlying legislation piles 
on requirements that obstruct first- 
time sponsors and small businesses 
from 
participating, 
this 
substitute 
makes room for them so that the reg-
istered apprenticeship program is ripe 
with opportunities for prospective ap-
prentices from a variety of employers. 
This amendment allows for innovation 
beyond the traditional registered sys-
tem, as well, to ensure that apprentice-
ship offerings will be able to grow and 
change as quickly as our employment 
market demands. 
Work-based learning is one of the 
most 
promising 
paths 
forward 
for 
workers seeking to find or enhance 
their careers. Such opportunities meet 
workers where they are, place them in 
dynamic learning environments, and 
develop their skills and competencies. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment that would transform the 
registered apprenticeship program into 
a modern program generating opportu-
nities for American workers without 
the red tape and roadblocks found in 
the underlying bill. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I am the only speaker, so I will be clos-
ing when I speak. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gentle-
woman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
FOXX), the ranking member of the com-
mittee. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Pennsylvania for his work on the com-
mittee, which has been excellent, and 
for his work on this bill and this 
amendment, in particular. 
Mr. Speaker, the National Appren-
ticeship Act has remained untouched 
for the last 80 years, until today. The 
legislation we put forward now should 
modernize the registered apprentice-
ship system and create forward-think-
ing solutions for the American work-
force. 
This amendment makes real reforms 
to the registered apprenticeship sys-
tem, sparks innovation, expands oppor-
tunities, 
and 
encourages 
alternate 
pathways for apprentices and employ-
ers. 
Who knows better what the work-
force needs than employers? 
Washington bureaucrats have run the 
one-size-fits-all system for decades, 
and far too many businesses still 
choose not to participate because it 
simply isn’t workable for them. This 
means job opportunities are left on the 
table because the current system isn’t 
built for success, opportunities we can-
not afford to close the door on if our 
workforce is going to recover from the 
damage done by the pandemic. 
If we want the registered apprentice-
ship system to adapt to the ever-chang-
ing needs of the economy and work-
force, we need to provide employers a 
seat at the table in making a model 
that actually addresses the skills gap. 
This amendment eliminates the bar-
riers that have developed over time in 
the current system, creates parity be-
tween union and nonunion-sponsored 
programs, and makes it easier for ev-
eryone to participate, particularly the 
small businesses and sponsors who 
have been shut out before. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment under-
mines the core premise behind the Na-
tional 
Apprenticeship 
Act 
of 
2020, 
which is to create 1 million more reg-
istered apprenticeship, pre-apprentice-
ship, and youth apprenticeship oppor-
tunities over the next 5 years. 
Registered 
apprenticeships 
are 
a 
proven earn-and-learn program. Nine-
ty-four percent of those who complete 
their apprenticeships are employed 
upon completion, with an average sal-
ary of $70,000. 
This amendment is nothing less than 
an attack on the successful registered 
apprenticeship program. It makes deep 
cuts in funding, which will result in 
sparse growth of the new registered ap-
prenticeships, while diverting scarce 
funds to untested, unproven programs 
run by third parties. Instead, it gives 
the Secretary of Labor a blank check 
to implement unregistered apprentice-
ship programs that are untested and 
unaccountable. It does this in several 
ways. 
First, it allows the Secretary of 
Labor to divert funds to unproven, un-
tested industry-recognized apprentice-
ship programs, or IRAPs. Unlike reg-
istered apprenticeships, there is no 
evaluation of IRAPs—none. 
When DOL proposed the creation of 
this untested program, it received over 
300,000 comments in opposition. Many 
of those comments noted that the reg-
istered apprenticeship program pro-
vides valuable credentials which are 
nationally recognized. IRAPs provide 
neither. 
Furthermore, the Trump administra-
tion’s own apprenticeship expansion 
task force recommended the DOL only 
conduct a pilot program for IRAPs to 
see if they could be effective and ac-
countable. Let’s be clear: The adminis-
tration’s own task force did not em-
brace a full-scale rollout of this untest-
ed idea, yet this substitute amendment 
opens the floodgates. 
Democrats do support innovation. An 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS) in 
the en bloc package allows the Sec-
retary of Labor to fund innovation and 
apprenticeships. His amendment au-
thorizes demonstration projects gov-
erning nontraditional sectors subject 
to the recommendations of the Na-
tional Advisory Committee on Appren-
ticeships appointed by the Secretary. 
These projects could even help COVID– 
19 responses. 
Second, the substitute amendment 
cuts funding for apprenticeship grants 
and cuts State apprenticeship formula 
grants. States have asked for funding 
certainty so that they can scale up 
their apprenticeship efforts and have 
been documented as the engine of suc-
cess for apprenticeship growth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6005 
November 20, 2020 
The major reform in this amendment 
is the fact that there is a 77 percent re-
duction in funding, resulting in only 
219 new apprenticeship opportunities 
rather than the 1 million new opportu-
nities that the National Apprenticeship 
Act provides. 
We all agree that apprenticeships are 
the pathway to the middle class, so 
why would we want to eliminate the 
rungs of opportunity for hundreds of 
thousands of potential apprentices? 
Third, this amendment eliminates an 
interagency agreement with the De-
partment 
of 
Education 
to 
create 
stronger alignment between the edu-
cation system and the national appren-
ticeship system. My colleagues on the 
other side often talk about wanting to 
create pathways for students to pursue 
alternatives to 4-year degrees, but this 
amendment eliminates the provisions 
in the National Apprenticeship Act 
that do just that. 
Some say we are creating a one-size- 
fits-all approach in this bill, but that 
isn’t true either. We include new ap-
prenticeship models, such as com-
petency-based hybrid models, expand 
youth apprenticeships and pre-appren-
ticeships, and that is something that 
employers have consistently requested. 
We open the doors to apprenticeships 
and industries where apprenticeship 
programs have never been utilized. 
This amendment is a step in the 
wrong direction. At a time when mil-
lions are losing their jobs permanently 
due to the pandemic, the economy is 
facing a deep recession, and we have 
other problems, the underlying bill is 
focused, without this amendment, on 
getting people back to work with the 
best skills possible. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this amendment and pass the bill to 
create 1 million new, good apprentice-
ship opportunities. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1224, the pre-
vious 
question

amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

PROVIDING FOR THE PRINTING OF 
A 
REVISED 
EDITION 
OF 
THE 
RULES AND MANUAL OF THE 
HOUSE 
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
FOR THE ONE HUNDRED SEVEN-
TEENTH CONGRESS 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I send to 
the desk a resolution and ask unani-
mous consent for its immediate consid-
eration. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TRONE). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1233 
Resolved, That a revised edition of the 
Rules and Manual of the House of Represent-
atives for the One Hundred Seventeenth Con-
gress be printed as a House document, and 
that three thousand additional copies shall 
be printed and bound for the use of the House 
of Representatives, of which nine hundred 
eighty copies shall be bound in leather with 
thumb index and delivered as may be di-
rected by the Parliamentarian of the House. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

SUPPORT FOR THE TRAVEL 
INDUSTRY 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, travel 
is by far the industry hardest hit by 
the ongoing fallout of the pandemic, 
accounting for 42 percent of all jobs 
lost in the U.S. since the start of the 
pandemic. 
No State has been hit harder by the 
pandemic than Nevada. I hear from 
constituents each and every day about 
how they are impacted by the loss of 
jobs and the need to get back to work 
safely. That is why I introduced the 
Hospitality and Commerce Recovery 
Job Act today, to ensure that the tour-
ism industry has the tax incentives 
necessary to get back on its feet. 
This legislation will work to imple-
ment the employee retention tax cred-
it, support the convention and trade 
show industries, restore the entertain-
ment business expense deduction, sup-
port the restaurant industry, and pro-
vide a tax credit for travel expenses. 
This legislation is necessary to en-
sure a robust travel and tourism econ-
omy that is the lifeblood of my State’s

RECOGNIZING SMALL BUSINESS 
SATURDAY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we have 
a lot to be thankful for in this country: 
the opportunity to raise our families, 
our freedom, our servicemembers and 
law enforcement who protect us, and 
the opportunity for prosperity and suc-
cess. Many people come to America for 
exactly these reasons, to pursue that 
dream. 
This year, so many self-made Ameri-
cans are struggling to keep their small 
businesses afloat. COVID–19 relief and 
leftover PPP funds continue to be held 
onto in this Chamber. 
Next 
Saturday, 
November 
28, 
is 
Small Businesses Saturday, an oppor-
tunity for all of us to support the small 
businesses and the dreams of our fellow 
citizens that own them. If we all collec-
tively make a conscious effort to shop 
small for our holiday gifts, we can help 
these local store owners in our neigh-
borhoods pull through these difficult 
times this winter. 
Our small businesses are doing every-
thing they can to stay open for their 
employees, and we really owe it to 
them and their futures to help them do 
so. We can be part of that by patron-
izing their businesses, not only this 
coming Saturday, November 28, but all 
through the year. 
f 
PRESERVING PRESIDENTIAL 
DOCUMENTS 
(Mr. CASTEN of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to speak to all of our Fed-
eral employees. 
Thank you for the dignity you have 
shown during the last 4 years. For 
every Alexander Vindman who was 
forced into the public spotlight, there 
are thousands more quiet patriots be-
hind him, and we are grateful. But we 
also need your help. 
Congress is still waiting to receive 
thousands 
of 
documents 
from 
the 
Trump administration. Multiple White 
House officials have been commu-
nicating through undocumented, non-
official channels. Many more are still 
blocking the release of information 
that directly pertains to their work for 
the United States Government, and 
that is illegal. 
Why this administration is afraid of 
transparency is tomorrow’s question. 
But today, every Federal agency must 
preserve those documents. The Presi-
dential Records Act of 1978 and the 
Federal Records Act of 1950 exist to en-
sure that no President enters office 
with our adversaries knowing more 
about the prior 4 years than they do. 
We need your vigilance over the next 
61 days to ensure those laws are hon-
ored. 
When elected officials failed us, we 
could still count on you. Now, once 
more into the breach, dear friends, 
once more. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
ADOPTION MONTH 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, No-
vember is National Adoption Month, 
and I rise in celebration of all the fami-
lies created and strengthened through 
the selfless act of adoption. 
Adoption has united countless chil-
dren with loving, caring parents, and 
every child deserves to grow up in a 
safe home. Many children have had 
their lives significantly improved by 
adoptive parents seeking to raise them 
as their own. 
Adoption is a powerful act, Mr. 
Speaker, and devoted parents are es-
sential to any child’s development and 
success. 
My wife, Kelly, was a widow when we 
married. Soon after, I adopted her 
daughter, Isabel, and she is wonderful, 
Mr. Speaker, just like her mama. Being 
a father has been one of the greatest 
joys of my life, and I will ever be 
thankful to both Kelly and Isabel for 
letting me be a part of their family. 
I am proud to stand on the floor of 
the House of Representatives, Mr. 
Speaker, today to honor all the fami-
lies, including my own, that have gone 
through the adoption process. Folks 
adopt children for any number of rea-
sons, but above all else, they do it out 
of love. I am the luckiest human on the 
face of the Earth, Mr. Speaker. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TROOPER CALEB 
STARR 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise with a heavy heart to honor and 
remember Trooper Caleb Starr of the 
Michigan State Police. 
A son of the city of Mason, Trooper 
Starr fulfilled his lifelong dream when 
he joined the force in 2018. For those 
who served alongside him, he was an 
exemplary officer. 
On the evening of July 10, while 
Trooper Starr was responding to a call, 
a drunk driver swerved into his lane, 
colliding with his patrol car head-on. 
Trooper Starr battled in the hospital 
for 3 weeks before passing away due to 
his injuries. He was just 33 years old. 
The impact he had cannot be fully 
described in these remarks, but it can 
be seen in his funeral procession, which 
included 100 vehicles from 15 different 
law enforcement agencies and three 
fire departments. It can be found in the 
close-knit community of first respond-
ers who showed up to his funeral, hon-
oring him with shirts that read ‘‘Starr 
Strong.’’ 
Lastly, it can be found in the out-
pouring of love and support from his 
wife, Rachael, and his two daughters, 
Evelyn and Rosalie. 
Service to your country is the great-
est love letter you can send. We all owe 
a debt of graduate to Trooper Caleb 
Starr, and it is my privilege to deliver 
these remarks so that he may live on 
in the RECORD of the people’s House. 
f 
MOVING FORWARD WITH 
DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, let me wish America a 
happy Thanksgiving. 
Just 24 hours ago, Pfizer indicated 
that they would seek an emergency au-
thorization of their vaccine at the 
Food and Drug Administration. 
People are dying. 250,000 have died. 
One million cases have already been 
met in Texas and California. 
The General Services Administrator 
does not have any legal authority to 
continue to block the certification that 
is needed for the incoming President 
and Vice President of the United 
States so they can be engaged in the 
distribution and the formula to be uti-
lized for the distribution of vaccines as 
they begin to come, with a number of 
companies ready to move forward. 
In interviews on national television, 
you are hearing different States saying 
that they are getting a certain amount 
and that others are getting a certain 
amount. It is a question of vulnerabil-
ity and those who are most vulnerable, 
those who cannot speak for themselves. 
Therefore, cooperation between the 
present administration and the Biden 
and Harris incoming administration is 
absolutely vital. 
I call upon the General Services Ad-
ministrator today to cease blocking 
this engagement for the betterment of 
the American people and to save lives.

HONORING JACKSON HEIGHTS 
JEWISH CENTER CENTENNIAL 
(Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the centennial 
anniversary of the Jewish Center of 
Jackson Heights by sharing some of 
their rich history in New York’s 14th 
Congressional District. 
The 
center 
was 
founded 
as 
the 
Queens Independent Society in 1920 
when a few Jewish families looked for 
a safe space to congregate in Jackson

Heights. The center was first called the 
Queens Independent Society because 
the term ‘‘Jewish’’ was not permitted 
at the time. 
The original building itself was based 
in Woodside, an adjacent neighborhood 
to Jackson Heights, because at the 
time Jews were not welcome in the 
neighborhood of Jackson Heights. How-
ever, in 1928, the center was able to re-
name itself the Jewish Center of Jack-
son Heights, and in the 1950s, they offi-
cially moved their brick and mortar 
into the neighborhood where they are 
housed today. 
Today, the center is known in the 
community as an inclusive and accept-
ing space, hosting a number of diverse 
community 
events 
throughout 
the 
year, as well as housing our beloved 
Queens Center for Gay Seniors. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the Jewish Cen-
ter of Jackson Heights. 
Thank you for your ongoing service 
to our community.

ECONOMIC HARDSHIP IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ) is rec-
ognized for 60 minutes as the designee 
of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to address what is top of 
mind to Americans across the country, 
and that is the extraordinary economic 
and health hardship of the COVID–19 
pandemic throughout this year. 
The reason I decided to rise today is 
because we are here convening in 
Washington, and just a day or two ago, 
the Senate majority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, decided to break the Sen-
ate. 
He broke the Senate as there are 
thousands of people in Texas lined up 
for food lines. He broke the Senate 
while hospitals no longer have beds to 
house the sick. He broke the Senate 
and dismissed the Senate while 30 mil-
lion Americans are on the brink of 
eviction. 
He dismissed the Senate when every 
single day when we go back to our 
communities, people are asking us: Is 
there going to be help? Is there going 
to be a second stimulus check? Are we 
going to get the resources that we 
need? 
He broke the Senate. And in breaking 
the Senate, we are abandoning our peo-
ple. 
Thanksgiving is around the corner, 
and there are millions of Americans 
that won’t be able to afford a meal to 
eat, that don’t know if they will be 
kicked out of their home, that are un-
sure if they are going to have to quit 
their job to care for their child. And we 
are having entire bodies, and the Sen-
ate prides itself as one of the most de-
liberative 
bodies, 
they 
abandoned 
them. 
The number of Americans living in 
poverty since May has grown by 8 mil-
lion people, since just May 2020. Ac-
cording to a study from Columbia Uni-
versity, this rise in poverty has been 
concentrated in Black and Latino chil-
dren and people. 
The CARES Act stimulus checks and 
unemployment benefits lifted more 
than 18 million individuals in the 
United States out of monthly poverty 
in April alone. But this number fell 
from 18 million to 4 million individuals 
in August and September after unem-
ployment benefits were expired. 
Just 44 percent of people in the 
United States are very confident that 
they can afford the needed food that 
will be necessary for the next 4 weeks. 
That means the majority of people in 
the United States are not very con-
fident in their ability to eat over the 
next 4 weeks, according to a new Cen-
sus survey data. About 10 percent, or 
3.5 million households, are not at all 
confident in their ability to eat the 
week before Thanksgiving, and the 
Senate broke. It is unconscionable, un-
conscionable leadership to abandon our 
people. 
b 1230 
And while we are arguing about nego-
tiations, and while we are arguing 
about points, people are going hungry. 
And we are dismissing their needs as 
blue State needs or as bailouts depend-
ing on what party you voted for. Hun-
ger has no party. Illness has no party. 
And when we allow suffering to be alle-
viated or concentrated based on polit-
ical affiliation, we are doing a dis-
service to our entire Nation. 
This uncertainty in food reflects food 
hardship across the country, with 5.6 
million households with children strug-
gling to put enough food on the table 
in the last 7 days. 
Landlords filed at least 43,500 evic-
tions in 17 major cities from March 
until September. An estimated 13.4 
million adults living in rental housing 
today—nearly one-in-five renters—were 
not caught up on rent. 
Small businesses don’t know if they 
are going to survive or exist in a 
month, in a week, in January. 
We cannot afford to wait for a new 
administration or another election, or 
a political state of play. We need to get 
people help now, and the Senate broke. 
They broke. 
We are supposed to be here to work 
for everyday people. We are not sup-
posed to be here to work for political 
donors or political favors or the power-
ful. We are here to serve the people 
who are most vulnerable, all the way 
up to the top. But we start with the 
people most in need. 
Our country is going hungry on the 
week before Thanksgiving, and the 
Senate broke. I don’t care what party 
you are. It is an abandonment of our 
responsibilities as elected officials who 
are charged with acting in the public 
trust. 
The unemployment rate jumped in 
April to a level not seen since the 1930s 
and still stood at 6.9 percent in Octo-
ber. Some 10.8 percent of Black work-
ers and 8.8 percent of Latino workers 
were unemployed in October compared 
to 6 percent of White workers. Last 
week, 1.1 million Americans filed new 
unemployment claims. Today, 4.4 mil-
lion Americans are receiving pandemic 
emergency unemployment compensa-
tion, up from 1.4 million in August. 
Last week was the 35th straight week 
total initial claims were greater than 
the worst week of the Great Recession, 
and the Senate broke. 
You know, I want to address some of 
the claims, because yesterday I said 
that we need to make sure that people 
get economic relief due to these shut-
downs. And I was surprised to hear so 
many 
Republicans 
now 
concerned 
about how we are going to pay for it or 
using other people’s money. But the 
Senate majority leader wasn’t con-
cerned about other people’s money 
when he authorized a $4 trillion lever-
aged bailout for Wall Street in March. 
He wasn’t concerned about where that 
money came from. He wasn’t concerned 
about how we were going to pay for 
that. 
It is only when we are talking about 
relief for working people, for children, 
for families, for parents, for education, 
for healthcare that, all of a sudden, we 
can’t pay for any of these things. But 
when it comes to tax subsidies for pri-
vate jets, we have got the money for 
that. When it comes to the endless ap-
propriation towards more and more 
military spending, when we aren’t 
even, technically, in growing elements 
of war, according to some people, we 
have money for that. But we don’t have 
money to feed our own kids. We don’t 
have money to educate people. We 
don’t 
have 
money 
to 
provide 
healthcare. 
But we have money for private jets. 
We have money for tax loopholes for 
yachts. We have money to incentivize 
stock buybacks. We have a billion dol-
lars to invest in research and develop-
ment for a vaccine—which was proudly 
invested in and a good use of public 
funds—just for pharmaceutical compa-
nies to take these publicly developed 
drugs and then sell them back to the 
public at no discount, so we don’t even 
get a return on this investment. How is 
that fiscally responsible? 
So we are living in a world and a 
state of play in our governance where 
the party who is eager to help subsidize 
private jets somehow can’t find the 
dollars and the cents to get people a 
$1,200 check. It is unconscionable, and 
it is wrong. And the Senate broke.

traordinarily difficult to represent a

working-class district, not a private jet 
district, and go home every week, just 
as I am about to do again, and feel as 
helpless in this body because the ma-
jority of its Members and the majority 
of the Senate can’t seem to get it to-
gether and get people the help that we 
need. And the Senate broke. 
This is what I have to do. This is 
what we are resorting to, speaking to 
an empty room because the Senate 
broke. 
So if there is anything that I have 
left to say, if there is anybody out 
there that is listening, if you are a 
working family, if you are struggling 
to get the food that you need, if you 
feel like you are on the brink of evic-
tion, we see you. We see you. 
What I ask of the Senate and what I 
ask of our Republican colleagues in the 
Senate is to act as if you were the one 
that was going hungry. Act as if it is 
you getting evicted from your house. 
Act with that urgency. 
That is all I have to say. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we 
have had an interesting week. Not a lot 
of critical votes have taken place. It 
was more of an organizational week we 
have had here. At the same time, the 
country’s election hangs in the bal-
ance. 
I think it is important to take a step 
back in history, though. It is very in-
teresting when you look back and see 
what things have happened in the past 
that maybe affected our future. 
Here is an article from Republican _ 
Michigander published by RedState: 
Don’t let Soros and the ‘‘Secretary of 
State Project’’ take over your State. 
In 2010, the Secretary of State Project is so 
far targeting Michigan, California, Iowa, 
South Dakota, Ohio, and Minnesota. This 
post is Michigan specific, but look at the list 
of 
donors 
to 
a 
State 
level 
Michigan 
downticket race. Chances are this is hap-
pening in your state, too. 
The article says: 
You know comrades, says Stalin, that I 
think in regard to this: I consider it com-
pletely unimportant who in the party will 
vote, or how; but what is extraordinarily im-
portant is this—who will count the votes, 
and how. That is from Boris Bazhanov’s, 
‘‘Memoirs of Stalin’s Former Secretary.’’ 
Boss Tweed says, As long as I count the 
votes, what are you going to do about it? 
Some of the most overlooked and ultra-im-
portant positions in this state, talking about 
Michigan, are those who run the elections. 
Those are the county clerk, township/city 
clerk, and the secretary of state’s office. It 
takes the work of these offices and their 
staffs to run the elections and make sure the 
process is above board—and, again, this is 10 
years ago, 2010—competent, and with integ-
rity. Livingston County does a great job 
with its Bureau of Elections. While these po-
sitions shouldn’t be politicized, at least when 
it comes to elections, they are in a big way, 
and this politicization is coming to Michi-
gan. 
Some people don’t like it when their boys 
don’t make the rules of the game. First and 
foremost is the benefactor of the Democrats, 
convicted insider trader George Soros, the 
man who broke the Bank of England. Much 
like his counterparts at Goldman Sachs, he 
makes a killing off of speculating, and what 
better way of doing that than by controlling 
elections. Other rich leftist democrats also 
wanted to get their people elected in their 
attempt to control our lives. 
Their project is called the Secretary of 
State Project. Its goal is to get their type of 
democrats in charge, and then look the other 
way when ACORN and PIRG to commit voter 
fraud, rigging the election for the democrats. 
They had some success in 2006. . . . 
And people can go online and find 
back in 2006 a report that George Soros 
and Democrats were going to be fund-
ing elections and selections of people, 
who would be involved in counting the 
votes in important places. 
Most of us didn’t pay much attention 
to that. I know in Texas I thought, 
well, we are Texas. We elect Repub-
lican Governors, and they appoint our 
Secretary of State, so we are safe from 
this effort by the Soros Democrats. 
What I didn’t think about back in 
2006 and 2010 was the fact that county 
clerks are really responsible for the 
vote counting in their county. In most 
of east Texas, west Texas, south, and 
the Panhandle, if a county clerk and 
her or his staff did not do the counting 
of the ballots, we might get upset and 
vote them out. But in our biggest cit-
ies, biggest counties, like Dallas, Har-
ris County where Houston is, Austin 
area, San Antonio area, they hire firms 
that come in, some of which we find 
out had Soros-type money that helped 
start these things. Maybe it is his, 
maybe it wasn’t, maybe it was through 
Open Source or Tidewater, different 
groups that launder the money through 
different organizations, so it is hard to 
tell where it really came from, but we 
know it is people that wanted to con-
trol elections that got involved in de-
ciding who would be in charge of count-
ing the votes. Just like brother Stalin 
and brother Boss Tweed, they had fig-
ured out it doesn’t matter who votes. 
What matters is who counts the votes. 
b 1245 
So this article goes on. This is 2010. 
FOX News reported: ‘‘Since 2006 the 
Democracy Alliance, a left leaning in-
fluence group funded by George Soros 
among others, has had remarkable suc-
cess in targeting and claiming Sec-
retary of State’s offices in 11 of 13 crit-
ical States they targeted, including 
Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa. 
‘‘Called 
the 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Project (SOSP) its aim is to target and 
capture the obscure, often overlooked 
office and implement election rules 
changes that give democrats a better 
chance of winning a plurality. Among 
those changes that the Secretary of 
State Project calls ‘election protec-
tion,’ are a loosening of voter registra-
tion requirements and a lessening of ef-
forts to prevent fraudulent voting, ac-
cording to Matthew Vadum, a political 
analyst with the Capital Research Cen-
ter. 
‘‘ ‘The thing that is amazing is that 
they can get the office for as little as 
$100,000 in campaign funding because 
no one pays attention to it, and they 
get to control election opportunities in 
a State. It is cheap,’ Vadum said. He 
said SOSP is currently targeting three 
States in the 2010 election: California, 
Michigan, and Minnesota. In total they 
count for 82 electoral votes. 
‘‘Vadum says that because of chaos 
and 
demoralization 
the 
Republican 
Party has not formulated a response to 
the Secretary of State Project or tried 
to match their efforts.’’ 
That was 2010. We did not learn. And 
those campaigns, the project, had a 
profound effect. 
‘‘Brunner has been a disaster in Ohio, 
unless you are trying to rig the game 
for the dems. There was tons of shadi-
ness in Ohio for the 2008 election. The 
good news about Brunner is that she is 
running for U.S. Senate where she can 
do less damage, even if she wins. 
‘‘Brunner made news in October 2008 
when she declined to hand over to 
county election boards 200,000 names 
on voter registration forms where the 
drivers license or Social Security num-
ber on the forms did not match the 
name. The Secretary of State Project 
praised her actions.’’ 
This is another report: ‘‘Blackwell’s 
office was one of the first and most 
critical offices claimed by the Sec-
retary of State Project. He was suc-
ceeded in 2006 by Jennifer Brunner, 
who received $167,000 in campaign con-
tributions from the Secretary of State 
Project, and immediately began a com-
plete overhaul of Ohio’s voting system. 
Among the changes she made were al-
lowing election day registration and 
the failure to purge election rolls of in-
eligible and dead voters.’’ 
As Lyndon Johnson famously told his 
campaign manager: 
No, sir. This man has every bit as 
much right to vote as anybody else in 
this cemetery. 
Back to the article. ‘‘Her most mem-
orable moment was when a Federal 
court judge ruled that she had violated 
Federal law for ‘not taking adequate 
steps to validate the identity of newly 
registered voters.’ At the time she ad-
mitted that there were ‘discrepancies’ 
in about 200,000 new registrations but 
refused to allow polling workers to 
take action on the questionable bal-
lots.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, if someone begins to see 
a pattern—gee, this was 2010. I didn’t 
wake up until late in 2018. But this 
went on around the country, getting 
people in positions that they would be 
responsible for counting the votes and 
making rules, though that is supposed 
to be left to the legislature of each 
State, according to the Constitution, 
making rules as to what votes count 
and what votes don’t.

November 20, 2020 
Going back to the article. ‘‘When 
Jennifer Brunner defeated incumbent 
Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio in 2006, 12 of 
the 18 individuals who contributed the 
maximum $10,000 to Brunner’s cam-
paign resided in States other than 
Ohio. (One of these donors, inciden-
tally, was Teresa Heinz Kerry.) Said 
Brunner, ‘I received significant support 
from the Secretary of State Project, 
which helped me toward the election.’ 
‘‘Brunner went on to make her influ-
ence felt in the 2008 election cycle, 
when she ruled that Ohio residents 
should be permitted, during the des-
ignated early-voting period extending 
from late September to early October, 
to register and vote on the very same 
day. Citing the potential for voting 
fraud under such an arrangement, Re-
publicans objected. But on September 
29 of that year—the day before early 
voting was scheduled to commence— 
the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Brun-
ner’s decision.’’ 
I thank the Ohio Supreme Court for 
their contribution to voter fraud; and 
not to leave out our wonderful Chief 
Justice John Roberts, who similarly 
ruled, in effect: 
So what. There is fraud maybe, 
maybe not. I am not going to do any-
thing about it. Thank you very much. 
‘‘In 
a 
separate 
matter, 
Brunner 
sought to effectively invalidate a mil-
lion absentee-ballot applications that 
Republican 
Presidential 
candidate 
John McCain’s campaign had issued. 
Each of those applications had been in-
advertently printed with an extra, un-
necessary 
checkbox, 
and 
Brunner 
maintained that if a registrant failed 
to check the box—even if he or she 
signed the form—the application could 
be rejected. On October 2, the Ohio Su-
preme Court overturned Brunner’s di-
rective on grounds that it served ‘no 
vital purpose or public interest.’ ’’ 
I mean, after all, it was John 
McCain; he was going to be beat, so we 
will let that one go. 
‘‘Brunner’s most noteworthy claim 
to fame took place in October 2008, 
when she refused to provide county 
election boards approximately 200,000 
voter-registration forms in which the 
name did not match the driver’s license 
or Social Security number. 
‘‘Count the dems, and reject the GOP 
votes. Boss Tweed would be proud. 
That is what the Secretary of State 
Project wanted, and what they got. 
‘‘Mark Ritchie was the Secretary of 
State who certified Al Franken’s win 
on a recount. He was a Secretary of 
State Project candidate and here is the 
result. 
‘‘(Mary) 
Kiffmeyer 
is 
‘absolutely 
sure’ that Ritchie’s efforts to eliminate 
voting regulations ensured Franken’s 
victory. 
‘‘ ‘The first thing he did when he got 
into office was to dismantle the ballot 
reconciliation 
program 
we 
started. 
Under that program districts are re-
quired to check that the number of bal-
lots issued by matching them with the 
number of ballots cast,’ she said, ‘that 
way we know immediately that the 
vote count is accurate.’ 
‘‘ ‘But that isn’t what happened,’ she 
said. ‘We now have 17,000 more ballots 
cast than there are voters who voted 
and no way to determine what went 
wrong. Why anyone would eliminate 
that basic check, I don’t know,’ she 
said.’’ 
Well, she doesn’t know, but some of 
us know exactly why you eliminate 
that check to make sure the vote 
counting is accurate, because that way 
you can have 17,000 people who didn’t 
vote cast votes. And, obviously, there 
are people that have lost with a whole 
lot less than 17,000 votes on the other 
side. 
‘‘The Vadum guy quoted earlier was 
Matthew Vadum. He is one of the main 
guys at Capital Research, a good orga-
nization that has tracked the shadiness 
of these foundations and similar groups 
for years. He wrote a good piece in The 
American 
Spectator 
about 
the 
Franken-Coleman race and its Sec-
retary of State. 
‘‘Both Franken and Obama, by the 
way, were endorsed by ACORN Votes, 
ACORN’s federal political action com-
mittee. 
‘‘Minnesota’s secretary of state isn’t 
a Democrat by happenstance. 
‘‘Ritchie, who defeated two-term in-
cumbent Republican Mary Kiffmeyer 
in 2006, received an endorsement and fi-
nancial assistance for his run from a 
below-the-radar nonFederal ‘527’ group 
called the Secretary of State Project. 
The entity can accept unlimited finan-
cial contributions and doesn’t have to 
disclose them publicly until well after 
the election. 
‘‘The founders of the Secretary of 
State Project, which claims to advance 
‘election protection’ but only backs 
Democrats, religiously believe that 
right-leaning 
secretaries 
of 
state 
helped the GOP steal the presidential 
elections in Florida in 2000 (Katherine 
Harris) and in Ohio in 2004 (Ken 
Blackwell). 
‘‘The secretary of state candidates 
the group endorses sing the same fa-
miliar song about electoral integrity 
issues: Voter fraud is largely a myth, 
vote suppression is used widely by Re-
publicans, cleansing the dead and fic-
tional characters from the voter rolls 
should be avoided until embarrassing 
media reports emerge, and anyone who 
demands that a voter produce photo 
identification before pulling the lever 
is a racist, democracy-hating Fascist. 
‘‘Most media reports also leave out 
the fact that Ritchie has extensive ties 
to the controversial in-your-face direct 
action group, ACORN (Association of 
Community Organizations for Reform 
Now), whose employees have been im-
plicated in electoral fraud time and 
time again.’’ 
Which is another reason ACORN 
doesn’t exist. They were driven out of 
existence because of illegality and 
fraud, and it sounds like they just 
melded into other groups that were 
trying to do the same things ACORN 
did before being disbanded. 
Going back to the article. ‘‘In 2006, 
the Minnesota ACORN Political Action 
Committee endorsed Ritchie and do-
nated to his campaign. According to 
the Minnesota Campaign Finance and 
Public Disclosure Board, contributors 
to Ritchie’s campaign included liberal 
philanthropists George Soros, Drum-
mond Pike, Deborah Rappaport, along 
with 
veteran 
community 
organizer 
Heather Booth, a Saul Alinsky disciple 
who cofounded the Midwest Academy, 
a radical ACORN clone. One article on 
Ritchie’s 2006 campaign website brags 
about the fine work ACORN did in 
Florida to pass a constitutional amend-
ment to raise that State’s minimum 
wage. 
‘‘ACORN got their man in. Their man 
made sure Stuart Smalley became a 
senator. The good news is that Mark 
Ritchie is running for reelection in 
Minnesota. Hopefully, the good people 
there throw his sorry rear out. 
‘‘But closer to home, the Secretary of 
State Project wants their own Mark 
Ritchie or Jennifer Brunner right here 
in Michigan. Her name is Jocelyn Ben-
son. What are Benson’s credentials? 
‘‘Benson is a native of Philly, well 
known for vote fraud.’’ 
In 2010, this article is being written. 
Philly, well known for vote fraud. 
Don’t we know. 
‘‘She went to Harvard Law. I have 
seen enough damage done by Harvard 
Law 
politicians 
like 
Obama 
and 
Granholm to refuse to back anyone 
who went there for political office. In 
2004, for the democrats, she ran the poll 
challenging/poll watching programs for 
the DNC. They want the fox guarding 
the henhouse. She is also a protege of 
Jennifer Brunner. Yes, that Brunner. 
She was recently endorsed (before dems 
convention) by the SEIU, the most far 
left of the union leadership. 
‘‘The Blog Prof has been on the case 
researching Benson with posts here and 
here. 
‘‘In order to ensure that elections are 
fair, conducted with integrity, and le-
gitimate, Jocelyn Benson and her 
friends at Secretary of State Project 
MUST be defeated by any legal means 
necessary. We must keep ACORN, 
PIRG-IM, Soros, MoveOn.org, and the 
rest of those groups out of the Sec-
retary of State office here. 
‘‘We will be keeping a close eye on 
this race. . . .’’ 
b 1300 
But nonetheless, that again, that was 
2010, and then they go on to list lots of 
liberal Democrats supporting the Sec-
retary of State Project, at least 250 of 
the 1,600. 
But then here is another article from 
February 
of 
2010, 
FOX 
News, 
Ed 
Barnes: ‘‘States’ Secretaries of State 
Are Tipping the Balance of Power.’’ 
‘‘In 2000, it was Katherine Harris, the

critical decisions that helped swing the 
State Republican.

democratic wrath for ensuring a close 
Republican win. 
‘‘In 2008, it was the secretary of state 
of Minnesota, Mark Richie, who handed 
that State’s Senate seat to Al Franken 
and control of Congress to the Demo-
crats. 
‘‘In every major election since 2000, 
secretaries of state have emerged as 
key, often decisive, and partisan fig-
ures in the outcomes of those ballot 
battles. 
‘‘And just last week in Massachu-
setts, there was cause of concern that 
the upset victory by Scott Brown could 
be compromised by that State’s sec-
retary of state, who has to certify the 
results. 
‘‘According to Professor Robert Pas-
tor of the Center for Democracy and 
Election 
Management 
at 
American 
University, the situation has gotten so 
bad that the partisan roles of the secre-
taries of states in the election process 
are undermining the faith of Ameri-
cans in the election process. 
‘‘ ‘After the 2000 election, partisan-
ship in the office accelerated. It has 
skewed enough elections since then 
that a sufficient number of Americans 
should be concerned,’ he said. ‘We are 
worse than many Third World coun-
tries’ in holding fair and nonpartisan 
elections.’’ 
And, again, that is February 2010 
that this was written. 
‘‘And now there is a quiet, below-the- 
radar but major effort to target sec-
retary of state offices in order to influ-
ence the outcome of upcoming elec-
tions. 
‘‘Since 2006, the Democracy Alliance, 
a left-leaning influence group funded 
by George Soros among others, has had 
remarkable success in targeting and 
claiming secretary of state’s offices in 
11 of 13 critical States they targeted, 
including Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa. 
‘‘Called 
the 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Project, SOSP, its aim is to target and 
capture the obscure, often overlooked 
office and implement election rules 
changes that give Democrats a better 
chance of winning a plurality.’’ 
So, on that goes, and it covers some 
of the same ground as the last article. 
But it is amazing, though, the bril-
liant strategy—you know, if you don’t 
mind fraud—the brilliant strategy of 
targeting secretaries of state, and in 
States like Texas where the secretary 
of state is appointed by a Republican 
Governor—has been for years—you go 
after the county clerks and make sure 
you have got good, stout Democrats 
who will hire firms funded, started by 
Democrat-leaning 
organizations 
so 
that they can work the system. 
Now, I mentioned earlier, I didn’t 
wake up on how serious this effort, this 
brilliant effort by people on the far left 
was until I saw evidence of manipu-
lating the results in Dallas County by 
the firm—and if I recall correctly, that 
may have been one of the Canadian- 
started firms. It has been a while, but 
they were hired to come in. 
And think about it. If you wanted to 
manipulate the outcome of an election, 
you get your person in to hire a firm 
where people could be trained to ma-
nipulate the vote. 
And say you had early voting, like 
Dallas, like every place in Texas had, 
and each precinct turns in a flash drive 
with the votes on the flash drive to the 
person heading up the Democrat firm— 
Democrat-funded firm that then has 
from Friday night until Tuesday night 
to play with those returns. 
And there were clear indications that 
in 2018, in the primary, that the early 
voting counts were manipulated. 
They made some mistakes. But, you 
know, they were just getting this thing 
down, trying to figure out how to do it 
without being caught, so they made 
some silly blunders that made very evi-
dent the fact that they had manipu-
lated numbers in the primary. 
By the general election of 2018 in Dal-
las County, they got better about hid-
ing it, but when you have got brilliant 
people who are looking into it, it is 
easier. I mean, those manipulations 
can be found and were found, and the 
information was offered to the Texas 
attorney general, whom I personally 
urged multiple times over the past 2 
years: You have got to get on top of 
this, because the manipulations that 
we saw in Dallas County need to be ex-
posed. People need to be indicted, and 
people need to go to jail for stealing 
elections or, at least, manipulating 
elections, and that way we can ensure 
a fair vote nationally in 2020. 
Apparently, our attorney general was 
preoccupied by other things, so he 
never got around to getting a warrant, 
which I believe it sure looked like 
probable cause evidence sufficient to 
get a warrant to seize the vote count-
ing equipment used in 2018. 
As I understand, that has all been de-
stroyed by now. The opportunity was 
missed by the Texas attorney general’s 
office to seize those with a warrant and 
show for the world exactly how manip-
ulations were done. It is a lost oppor-
tunity. 
And, of course, since we have a Direc-
tor of the FBI who has shown more of 
an interest—he was put there to clean 
up the FBI of the massive abuse at the 
top, 
not 
necessarily 
demonstrated 
around the country. We have got a lot 
of great FBI agents around the coun-
try, but right here in Washington, I 
have seen the corruption firsthand. I 
have seen manipulation of the truth. I 
have seen FBI agents who lied about 
what they found and what they did in 
order to prevent people from being 
prosecuted that should have been. 
I have seen deals made like with 
Cheryl Mills: Gee, you let us—we have 
got plenty of evidence to get a warrant 
and seize your computer, but if you 
will just let us look, we promise not to 
make copies of anything. We promise 
that we will give it back, and we prom-
ise, under this agreement, you can’t be 
prosecuted for anything that we find— 
and then giving the evidence back that 
could have been seized with a warrant, 
allowing that individual to sit in on 
the questioning of a potential target, 
though Mills could have been a target 
herself. 
These are the kinds of things that 
have given people across America the 
wrenching questions: Why has nobody 
gone to jail on that side of the political 
aisle? 
And that is a good question, and the 
answer is heartbreaking. 
If we don’t enforce the rule of law, es-
pecially in something as critical as 
elections, then we have known for 
some time we were going to be headed 
in the direction of a Third World gov-
ernment. And that is apparently what 
we have got in this election. 
It could still be saved. The good 
thing for those involved in fraud in this 
last election is that you have a lot of 
Republicans who say: Look, we just 
want people to get along. You know, it 
is unpleasant when you talk about 
fraud in an election. 
Well, yeah, it is because it will mean 
the end of this little experiment in 
self-government. So, yeah, that is un-
pleasant to talk about. But if we don’t 
clean up the process in this election, 
then there will be no free and fair fu-
ture elections. 
As a judge handling felonies, it was 
made clear in the short school we went 
to upon becoming judges, and then it 
was made abundantly clear—anybody 
who just kept researching the law, try-
ing to follow the law—that there are 
two critical types of deterrents that 
can ensure a brighter future for a self- 
governing country. 
One is general deterrence. There 
needs to be treatment of lawbreakers, 
in this case, people who have been in-
volved in the fraud, to such an extent 
that the general public would not be 
tempted to engage in the fraudulent 
conduct. But that would be a deterrent. 
It would scare them out of partici-
pating. 
That is what I had hoped if our Texas 
attorney general’s office had pursued 
the fraud that we knew of in Dallas 
County from the 2018 elections. There 
could have been general deterrents. 
And then, also, there are specific de-
terrents for the person engaged in the 
fraud, and that is you have a sentence 
strong enough that would deter the in-
dividual criminal from engaging in 
such conduct in the future that they 
would want to conform their conduct 
to the requirements of the law so they 
did not end up with another sentence 
like they got in that case. 
The problem for both general and 
specific deterrents, when it comes to 
voter fraud over recent years, is there 
has been no deterrence. There were a 
number of indictments issued in spe-
cific places, including the Gregg Coun-
ty commissioner, Democrats involved 
and others, but none involving the big 
frauds that would change a national 
election. 
So that has been really tragic to see 
the missed opportunities. But those of 
us who never stop studying history 
know that this is one of those lessons

November 20, 2020 
that gets—that is failed to be learned 
over and over, that brings about the 
end to republics. 
Of course, in the first great republic, 
the Roman Republic, they had tried to 
learn lessons from the democracy of 
Athens, and they did. But soon things 
degenerated. The leadership was ab-
sent. 
Caesar, as head of the military, did 
something that was illegal, crossed the 
Rubicon, and that was the end of the 
republic. Though senators still contin-
ued to be elected, by that point, it was 
a lost cause. 
b 1315 
So I am looking here at an affidavit 
by Mellissa Carone, and something 
that many in the news media have not 
understood, and that is that when you 
say an allegation is unfounded, it 
means there is no evidence, a no evi-
dence point, as appellate courts would 
call it. And when there is somebody 
who has risked going to jail for perjury 
and sworn to being a witness to fraud, 
then whether you like the evidence or 
not, that is evidence. It is not un-
founded. It is evidence. 
There are hundreds of affidavits that 
have been produced—maybe thousands. 
Some witnesses really don’t have any-
thing helpful, speculative suggestions, 
and those are not real evidence because 
they have no direct knowledge. It is 
kind of like the whistleblower—so- 
called whistleblower—who had no di-
rect knowledge and no direct evidence. 
Well, that is not evidence if it would 
not be admissible in court. But if some-
body has taken an oath and stated they 
witnessed fraudulent conduct, that is 
evidence. In some cases, the testimony 
is the creating of an environment in 
which fraud could occur and then see-
ing indications that fraud had oc-
curred. 
As someone once said about cir-
cumstantial evidence—I know some 
people say that you can’t convict 
somebody on circumstantial evidence. 
Oh, yes. It is done all the time. This 
particular law student gave an exam-
ple: If I am driving by Baylor Stadium, 
I can’t see what is going on inside the 
stadium. But I know it is the time that 
a game was supposed to happen be-
tween Baylor and another team, and I 
can see the scoreboard and both of 
those teams are listed on the score-
board. There is time that is clicking 
down, and there are scores, and there is 
the roar of the crowd, and I see the 
score change. I don’t have direct evi-
dence there is a football game going 
on, but when you look at all the cir-
cumstances, then clearly that is cir-
cumstantial evidence that a football 
game is going on. 
So, Mr. Speaker, when you have evi-
dence of all the circumstances and then 
outcomes that show this could not 
have happened without some mis-
conduct or some gross negligence, then 
you have got significant evidence. 
This affidavit by this witness talks 
about the Dominion training, and this 
witness was hired, contracted, by Do-
minion Voting Services to perform IT 
work at the TCF Center in Detroit for 
the November 3, 2020, election. This 
person is a resident of Michigan. 
It says: 
During both shifts that were worked, I wit-
nessed 
extreme 
irregularities 
in 
ballot 
counting, ballot fabrication/completion and 
data security. 
Now, that is a summary, and again, 
not necessarily direct evidence, since 
we don’t have any specifics. 
But the affidavit goes on: 
Improper counting protocol was prevalent 
during both shifts. It appeared the majority 
of people who manned the scanners or the 
counters 
were 
either 
untrained, 
poorly 
trained. They kept jamming machines and 
rescanning certain stacks of ballots. The 
proper procedure was to run a batch, a stack 
of 50 ballots through the tabulator and each 
ballot counted only once. When a jam hap-
pened, the computer would issue an error 
message indicating what number of the bal-
lot stack had jammed the tabulator. At that 
point, the counter had two options: manu-
ally discard the batch on the tabulator and 
rescan it, or to continue scanning from the 
jammed ballot through the end of the batch. 
Countless times, as I floated on the floor to 
assist with the jammed tabulators, I saw 
workers rescan entire batches of ballots 
without first discarding that very same par-
tially scanned batch. I witnessed entire bal-
lot batches rescanned multiple times. 
Many Dominion employees were hired like 
me 
to 
un-jam 
the 
tabulator 
machines 
throughout the counting process. The jams 
and rescans of batches of ballots without the 
deletion of the scanned partial batches of 
ballots prior to each rescan was quite dis-
turbing. 
At about midnight I was assisting one of 
the counters with a paper jam. I noticed his 
machine had a count of more than 400 ballots 
scanned in that particular batch. This was 
unusual, to say the least, because only one 
lot of a batch is processed at a time. This 
means that either the jammed batch had 
been counted at least 8 times or the counting 
machine was defective. 
I was so disturbed at this problem I 
brought it to the attention of my Dominion 
manager, Nick— 
Whatever his last name is, however 
you say that. 
Nick stated we were there to assist with 
IT, but not to run their election. 
Besides extreme counting irregularities, 
the adjudication process volunteers watching 
the counting is supposed to be witnessed by 
one Republican and one Democrat. The con-
versations I overheard between those watch-
ing were usually derogatory comments about 
Republicans, thus I concluded that often 
there were two Democrat election volunteer 
poll watchers at many of the machines and 
no Republican poll watcher at all. 
I want to describe what occurred during 
shift change, which commenced about 7 p.m. 
It was chaotic and stunningly disorganized. 
It took about 2 hours for people to be as-
signed an area. At one point perhaps 30 peo-
ple came downstairs to tabulation machines 
to be counters. At least four of them, one of 
whom I have known for over 20 years, told 
me they received absolutely no training for 
the counting area whatsoever. Upon informa-
tion and belief, none of these workers trans-
ferred to the mail-in ballot counting section 
knew how to fix a tabulation problem. I 
showed many of these new counters how to 
cancel a partially scanned batch of ballots 
before resubmitting that jammed batch of 
ballots to be rescanned. Many of these new 
counters whom I helped with jams admitted 
they had received no training. 
Prior to my first shift, I received an email 
from Dominion that I would be issued a 
badge when I arrived at the TCF Center. 
When I appeared for my first shift, it was dif-
ficult to enter the TCF Center because I did 
not receive a badge and could not prove my 
Dominion credentials. A Dominion employee 
nicknamed Danielle came over and explained 
who I was. Only then was I permitted to 
enter the building. 
When I asked my manager, Nick, for a 
badge, he replied that I didn’t need a badge. 
He stated we did not want our names to be 
showing because the challengers would at-
tempt to question us while working. As a re-
lated aside, I recall a co-worker taking off 
her Dominion badge when a challenger asked 
whether or not the adjudication hardware 
was connected to the internet. Finally, Sam-
uel Challendes removed his Dominion badge 
after a challenger took my picture and was 
escorted from the TCF Center. 
Samuel Challendes, a top Dominion em-
ployee from Denver, left the TCF Center 
midafternoon on November 3, 2020, to assist 
at the warehouse. 
When Samuel returned about 3 hours later, 
I asked him where the warehouse was and 
who owned it. I asked: Is it like an Amazon 
warehouse? 
He said, no, then explained that we call it 
the Chicago warehouse. It is where I had my 
pre-election training, the city of Detroit 
elections building. 
During the nightshift everyone was free to 
come and go as they pleased in and out of 
the counting room. Some people left report-
edly to smoke and returned later to the 
counting room. I believe it is illegal to do 
this because boxes and stacks of ballots were 
left unattended. Nobody was present to 
verify that no ballots were removed or 
brought in, no one was paying attention, no 
one logged people as they came and went. 
When I returned to the TCF Center at 10 a.m. 
November 4, I walked right into the building, 
nobody stopped me, security was absent and 
nonexistent. 
Sometimes city workers asked me for the 
location of the blank ballots. There was a 
white table of blank ballots left unattended. 
When a worker had a ballot or ballots that 
they deemed defective in some way, they 
would go to the white table of blank ballots 
and complete one or some. I believe they 
were supposed to complete the ballot to 
match exactly what the voter intended. I 
saw city workers actually sign names as this 
if they were the person who completed the 
original ballot reportedly being replicated. 
Nobody was present to verify if these newly 
completed replacement ballots were iden-
tical. 
Dominion employee Samuel Challendes 
and a city worker who looked to be in his 
mid-twenties were responsible for submit-
ting the final ballot numbers into the main 
computer. They had absolutely no super-
vision or accuracy verification. Dominion 
manager, Nick, was on the main floor assist-
ing with IT jams most of the time. There was 
no city of Detroit staff present to witness 
the process. 
During the evening, I overheard Samuel 
talking to Nick about losing tons of data. 
Then Samuel, Nick, and the city worker all 
moved to the side of the stage and made calls 
on their cellphones. I asked Nick what was 
going on. He replied it was all taken care of 
and not to worry. I did not see anyone ap-
proach the computer Samuel and the city 
worker utilized. Nick went back to helping 
un-jam the tabulator machines. It is my un-
derstanding this critical error remains un-
documented and unaddressed.

November 20, 2020 
Two vans pulled up to the garage of the 
counting room, one on day shift and one on 
night shift. I do not know what these vans 
contained, but I doubt it was food, because 
there was a shockingly short supply of food 
for the workers and I never saw food leave ei-
ther of the vans. Coincidentally, the news 
announced Michigan discovered 100,000 addi-
tional ballots less than 2 hours after the last 
van left the building. 
She goes on to talk about she was the 
only Republican working for Dominion 
Voting Systems that she was aware of. 
There are more allegations and more state-
ments, under oath. 
On November 5 I called the FBI to report 
the activity I witnessed which I believed to 
be criminal activity. After my initial report 
I was disconnected. When I called back and 
explained the nature of my call, I was placed 
on hold for a long time. Eventually I was 
able to explain my concerns, provide my con-
tact information. As of today, I have not 
been contacted by the FBI over my concerns 
of massive voter fraud. 
But anyway, that is an affidavit, and affi-
davits are indeed evidence. 
Here is an affidavit from another witness. 
It is sworn to. He personally observed the ab-
sent voter counting boards in Detroit at the 
TCF Center. He has attended the Wayne 
County campus on an almost daily basis. 
b 1330 
On November 17, there was a meeting of 
the board of canvassers to determine wheth-
er to certify the results of Wayne County. 
The meeting did not start until 5, supposed 
to start at 3. We were told it was delayed so 
that representatives of the Democrat board 
members could obtain additional affidavits. 
At 5 p.m., an open meeting and discussion 
began to discuss the issue of whether to cer-
tify the vote. In my review of the results, I 
determined that approximately 71 percent of 
Detroit’s 134 absent voter counting boards 
were left unbalanced and many unexplained. 
I informed the board members of the discrep-
ancies, but soon thereafter, a motion to cer-
tify was made by Vice Chairman Jonathan 
Kinloch. After further discussion, I renewed 
my concerns that the reason that the num-
bers did not balance for the majority of the 
AVCBs in Detroit and, importantly, could 
not be explained. If the vote totals did not 
match, there should have been a documented 
reason explaining why. 
The board considered the ultimate ques-
tion of whether to certify the vote, and the 
motion to certify failed 2–2. 
This vote was followed by public derision 
from our two Democrat colleagues. I, and 
Monica Palmer, who also voted against cer-
tification, were berated and ridiculed by 
members of the public and other board mem-
bers. This conduct included specious claims 
that I was racially motivated in my decision. 
This public ostracism continued for hours, 
during which time, we were not provided an 
opportunity to break for dinner and were not 
advised that we could depart and resume the 
hearing on another date. 
I discussed a potential resolution with Vice 
Chair Kinloch in confidence. Ms. Anderson- 
Davis told us that we must vote to certify on 
that night. We were told that we could not 
consider matters such as the unexplained 
reasons that most of Detroit’s AVCBs did not 
balance, and no one knew why. 
They were told they couldn’t con-
sider that. 
During the evening, Wayne County coun-
sel, Ms. Janet Anderson-Davis, and my col-
leagues on the board continued to discuss 
irregularities. Ms. Anderson-Davis advised 
the board that the discrepancies were not a 
reason to reject the certification, and based 
on her explicit legal guidance, I was under 
the belief that I could not exercise my inde-
pendent judgment in opposition to the cer-
tification. Therefore, I voted to certify the 
results. 
Late in the evening, I was enticed to agree 
to certify based on the promise that a full 
and independent audit would take place. I 
would not have agreed to the certification 
but for the promise of an audit. 
Then he goes on to explain the dif-
ferent promises he was made. But as 
pointed out: 
There are questions that need to be an-
swered and can only be answered if Wayne 
County’s canvass is transparent and provides 
information within its control. That infor-
mation includes: 
The logs indicating when drop box ballots 
were collected and delivered, the log of per-
sons who made these deliveries and who had 
access to drop-box keys and when that access 
was obtained. 
Similar concerns exist regarding the deliv-
ery of ballots to the TCF Center during the 
night of November 3 and the morning hours 
of November 4. 
I am also concerned about the use of pri-
vate moneys directing local officials regard-
ing the management of the elections, how 
these funds were used. 
He goes on: 
Why do the poll books, qualified voter 
files, and final tallies not match or balance? 
Seventy-one percent of Detroit’s did not 
balance. Why not? 
Anyway, great questions that need to 
be answered if we are going to ever get 
to a proper finding regarding the re-
sults in Wayne County. 
I have an affidavit from Monica 
Palmer that was just mentioned. So 
like I said, there are hundreds of affida-
vits and sworn testimony as to impro-
prieties. 
It should be noted, a lot of people 
have heard about, this is the title, ‘‘Do-
minion Part of Council That Disputed 
Election Integrity Concerns in DHS 
Statement.’’ This is by Jeff Carlson 
with Epoch Times. 
But we now know—it has been blast-
ed all over the news—that the Cyberse-
curity 
and 
Infrastructure 
Security 
Agency headed by Christopher Krebs— 
he was fired. But before he was fired, 
his Agency issued a statement on No-
vember 12 disputing the allegation, 
saying: ‘‘The November 3 election was 
the most secure in American history.’’ 
What that Agency failed to disclose, 
however, is that Dominion Voting Sys-
tems is a member of the cybersecurity 
agency CISA. They are a member of 
CISA’s Election Infrastructure Sector 
Coordinating Council, one of the two 
entities that authored the statement 
put out by CISA saying there is no 
fraud. 
The Agency didn’t respond to re-
quests for comment immediately, but 
this article goes on to point out both 
Dominion and Smartmatic are listed as 
members of CISA’s Sector Coordi-
nating Council and appear to be ac-
tively involved, as they are named as 
organizing members. Among the key 
objectives is to ‘‘serve as primary liai-
son between the election subsector and 
Federal, State, and local agencies, in-
cluding the Department of Homeland 
Security.’’ 
Let’s face it, Mr. Krebs worked for 
Microsoft at one time. They are not big 
fans of President Trump, nor is Bill 
Gates. But this article says: ‘‘As CISA 
notes, they do not have direct over-
sight or responsibility for the adminis-
tration of our Nation’s elections as 
that responsibility lies with State and 
local governments.’’ 
Yet, they had no problem issuing a 
statement promising everybody that 
these elections were totally free of 
fraud. Dominion used CISA to deny the 
allegations against Dominion. 
There is more in that article, but 
time is short. 
It is amazing. There was a judge, 
though. The judge didn’t issue any 
order that cleaned up the problem. The 
judge noted that the case presented 
‘‘serious system security vulnerability 
and operational issues that may place 
plaintiffs and other voters at risk of 
deprivation of their fundamental right 
to cast an effective vote that is accu-
rately counted.’’ 
That is kind of like John Roberts: 
Yep, the case is presented. Could be a 
lot of fraud here, but I am going to let 
the fraud go forward. I am not going to 
deal with it. 
This could be the last election where 
there is any hope of having a true two- 
party system for President. We saw 
what happened with the abuse by the 
FBI, Department of Justice, State De-
partment, a certain individual or pos-
sibly individuals. Even the Department 
of Defense got involved, trying to 
frame President Trump’s campaign, 
justified, according to some, originally, 
spying on the campaign. But we know 
a lot more now. 
But let me make clear to people that 
are a bit slow-witted, like somebody at 
the Dallas Morning News: I have never 
advocated for revolution. I have men-
tioned the American Revolution, but I 
have quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., including in the speech where I was 
said to have advocated for revolution. I 
said: We must follow his example, and 
that is a peaceful demonstration, that 
we can rise up, but it must be peaceful. 
How much clearer does it need to be? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING VANESSA MARCANO- 
KELLY AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Vanessa Marcano-Kelly, owner 
of Caracas Language Solutions and pas-
sionate community activist, as our Iowan of 
the Week for the week of October 9, 2020. 
Each year, Hispanic Heritage Month is cele-
brated nationwide from September 15th to Oc-
tober 15th. It is an opportunity to celebrate 
and highlight the culture, traditions, and con-
tributions of both Hispanic and Latinx Ameri-
cans and shine a light on how these contribu-
tions have and continue to build our country 
and society for the better. Today there are 
nearly 195,000 Hispanic and Latinx Americans 
residing in Iowa—more than six percent of the 
state’s population—and their families have en-
riched Iowa’s culture and communities for gen-
erations. I have no doubt Vanessa’s good 
work will leave its mark for generations to 
come. 
A native of Caracas, Venezuela, Vanessa is 
a certified court interpreter in the state of 
Iowa, owner and lead linguist at Caracas Lan-
guage Solutions since 2015 and respected by 
many for her drive to improve the lives of oth-
ers by breaking down the language barrier. 
She specializes in community, conference, 
and legal interpretation, as well as translation 
and subtitling. She began regularly interpreting 
and translating during her work as a commu-
nity organizer for Iowa Citizens for Community 
Improvement in 2012, and a year after real-
izing her passion for this profession, she ob-
tained the Iowa Spanish Court Interpreter Cer-
tification, which she has held since 2015. 
In 2014 Vanessa was the recipient of the 
LULAC Iowa Latino Leadership award. She 
also graduated from the Latina Leadership Ini-
tiative in 2014 and earned a place on the New 
Leaders Council in Des Moines. She serves 
on the board of directors of the Des Moines 
Film Society and the inaugural board of the 
Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice. 
Vanessa believes strongly in the importance 
of civic engagement and has utilized her skills 
and determination to make an impact. The 
pursuit of making her community a better 
place through positive action has led her to 
creating the first Spanish speaking caucus site 
in Iowa and becoming involved with organiza-
tions like the Latino Political Network and the 
Department of Latino Affairs. She’s worked 
with Grand View University on a multi-day pro-
gram to ensure the parents of prospective 
first-year college students not only had sup-
port but felt included and welcomed as they 
learned about their young adults’ educational 
opportunities. Vanessa also spearheaded the 
effort to expand access to COVID–19 informa-
tion through a live audio interpretation of the 
briefings in Spanish. 
I appreciate the opportunity to celebrate the 
culture and contributions of our Hispanic and 
Latinx neighbors not only during Hispanic Her-
itage Month but also year-round. I am honored 
to be their voice in Congress, and I will never 
stop fighting for legislation that makes Iowa a 
better place for their families. 
Providing better access to opportunities and 
success for all Iowans is one of my primary 
goals while serving in Congress, and I have 
tremendous respect for how Vanessa ap-
proaches the same goal. Her work is opening 
doors, creating connections, and fostering a 
stronger sense of community in our state. The 
Hispanic and Latinx population is the fastest 
growing group of individuals in Iowa, and ad-
vocates like Vanessa have been working 
every day to make sure they have the rep-
resentation they deserve. I want to thank 
Vanessa for her amazing efforts in Iowa’s 
Third Congressional District, and it is my 
pleasure to recognize her as Iowan of the 
Week.

HONORING DR. HAROLD C. 
SAYLES, PH.D. 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to honor and recognize 
Dr. Harold C. Sayles as the 2020 recipient of 
the inaugural Veteran of the Year Award for 
the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia. 
Dr. Sayles has dedicated his life to serving 
our country, both as a Major in the United 
States Army and as a veteran assisting former 
servicemembers in his community and across 
our nation. Since 2015, Dr. Sayles has served 
as the State Chaplain for the Department of 
Virginia’s Veterans of Foreign Wars. He offers 
spiritual counseling to veterans and their fami-
lies, performs funerals for servicemembers, 
visits hospitals and homes of ailing veterans, 
and provides countless other services for Vir-
ginia’s veterans. Dr. Sayles also serves on the 
Suicide Prevention Task Force for the South-
ern Conference of the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, helping our veterans access much- 
needed mental health services and support. 
For his service, Dr. Sayles has earned nu-
merous awards, including the Bronze Star 
Medal for heroism in combat action against 
enemy forces on February 10, 1991 in direct 
support of Operation Desert Storm. He was 
also awarded the Legion of Merit for excep-
tional service and outstanding achievement in 
the performance of duties from November 
1990 to March 1993 while serving with the 4th 
Psychology Operations Group, Airborne. Dr. 
Sayles has received a total of seven national 
and state-wide awards for his tireless work as 
Post Commander in the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, a title he has held on three different oc-
casions. 
In addition to his commitment to uplifting 
and caring for our nation’s servicemembers, 
we owe Dr. Sayles a debt of gratitude for the 
work he does for communities across the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. Dr. Sayles serves 
as the Executive Director of the Crater District 
Area Agency on Aging, providing services to 
senior citizens, and as Cub Master for Cub 
Scout Pack 525 and as Assistant Scoutmaster 
of Troop 525, helping younger generations 
learn vital civic and interpersonal skills. 
Dr. Sayles writes that, ‘‘I enjoy what I do 
and feel that I was not only born to serve, but 
a calling on my life.’’ His dedication to serving 
his country and community is matched only by 
his commitment to his wife, Dr. Cheryl Jordan- 
Sayles, and their four children. 
It is for these reasons and so many more 
that I am proud to recognize Dr. Sayles as the 
2020 recipient of the Fourth Congressional 
District of Virginia’s inaugural Veteran of the 
Year Award for his continued service to our 
Commonwealth and our country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Sayles for his devotion 
to the United States of America and his self-
less efforts to improve the lives of veterans 
and all those around him.

NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP ACT 
OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of my colleague Con-
gresswoman TITUS’ amendment to H.R. 
8294, the National Apprenticeship Act 
of 2020, which I cosponsored. 
Our travel and tourism industry em-
ploys nearly 16 million workers across 
our nation. In my home state of Ha-
waii, tourism is our main economic pil-
lar, with one out of five workers state-
wide employed within this industry. 
I have literally hundreds of thou-
sands of constituents and their families 
who are dependent on travel and tour-
ism fear for their future due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. The number of 
tourists arriving in Hawaii each day 
has dropped over 97 percent compared 
to a year ago. COVID–19 has devastated 
Hawaii’s economy and threatened the 
livelihoods of countless individuals, 
forcing all into uncertainty and too 
many into unemployment and worse. 
This bipartisan amendment will en-
sure these families and millions of 
their 
fellow 
workers 
and 
families 
across the country are not left behind 
by adding hospitality and tourism to 
the list of non-traditional apprentice-
ship industries eligible for the 21st Cen-
tury Grants in the Modernizing the Na-
tional 
Apprenticeship 
System. 
The 
amendment supports our workers and 
businesses in the hospitality industry 
at a time of great need, and it invests 
in this critical sector of our economy 
to help ensure a clearer path to recov-
ery. 
I am proud to support Congress-
woman TITUS’ amendment, and I re-
main committed to finding and pur-
suing opportunities that will help the 
travel and tourism industry swiftly re-
cover from the impacts of this pan-
demic.

CONDEMNING ACTS BY PEOPLE’S

THAT 
VIOLATE 
FUNDAMENTAL 
RIGHTS 
AND 
FREEDOMS 
OF 
HONG KONG RESIDENTS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of the Congressional China Caucus 
and senior member of the House of Rep-
resentatives, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 
1033, ‘‘Condemning acts by the People’s Re-
public of China and the Government of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that 
violate fundamental rights and freedoms of 
Hong Kong residents as well as acts that un-
dermine Hong Kong’s high degree of auton-
omy’’. 
First and foremost, I wish to thank my col-
league, Chairman ENGEL, for his leadership on 
the Foreign Affairs Committee as well as on 
this vital, bipartisan piece of legislation. 
Time and time again, the Federal Govern-
ment of the United States has had to rebuke 
Beijing for its aggression against Hong Kong 
and the Chinese Government’s continuous ef-
forts to restrict the region’s autonomy. 
Today, we will once again defend Hong 
Kong by passing this resolution, which calls on 
Beijing to rectify national security law provi-
sions inconsistent with the Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law and advises the U.S. gov-
ernment to coordinate with allies and partners 
to respond to the deterioration of rights and 
freedoms in Hong Kong. 
In 1997, the British relinquished control over 
Hong Kong to China under a unique agree-
ment which created the infamous ‘‘one coun-
try, two systems’’ principle. 
For over two decades, the people of Hong 
Kong enjoyed strong democratic institutions, 
including an independent judiciary, and have 
been able to proudly exercise their civil lib-
erties. 
However, since 2014, the Chinese govern-
ment has increasingly sought to undermine 
Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy. 
Most recently, on July 1, 2020, the Govern-
ment of China imposed sweeping national se-
curity legislation on the people of Hong Kong, 
fundamentally altering Hong Kong’s autonomy 
and undermining the basic rights and free-
doms promised to the people of Hong Kong 
under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a le-
gally binding international agreement guaran-
teeing that the social and economic systems, 
as well as the life-style, in Hong Kong will re-
main unchanged through 2047. 
Beijing’s national security law is the cul-
mination of Xi Jinping’s years long assault on 
Hong Kong’s democratic freedoms and auton-
omy, and we must do our part as defenders 
of democratic freedom around the world to 
push back on Beijing’s aggression. 
Under the national security law, the Chinese 
Government has criminalized any acts of: 
Secession, breaking away from the country; 
Subversion, undermining the power or au-
thority of the central government; 
Terrorism, using violence of intimidation 
against people; and 
Collusion with foreign or external forces. 
In addition, it authorizes China’s national se-
curity agencies to establish a presence in 
Hong Kong. 
This national security law gives Beijing a 
new tool with which to crack down on pro-
testers and dissidents as well as push forward 
education that trumpets the successes of the 
Communist Party. 
Mr. Speaker, you may remember that last 
year, pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong 
Kong in response to legislation that would 
have enabled suspected criminals to be extra-
dited to mainland China. 
Thousands of students, lawyers, pro-democ-
racy legislators, corporate executives, and oth-
ers came together to protest that grave incur-
sion of Hong Kong’s autonomy and appealed 
to the United States support their pro-democ-
racy movement, and we did by making the 
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 
public law. 
By passing this crucial resolution today, 
Members of Congress are standing up for the 
democratic principles we hold so dear. 
Since its founding, the United States has 
been a city upon a hill, the model of democ-
racy for the rest of the world, and a fierce de-
fender of civil liberties for all. 
It is our moral duty to stand up for what is 
right and condemn what is wrong. 
Our vote to pass H. Res. 1033 sends a 
clear message to China and the world that the 
U.S. not only condemns Beijing’s actions as 
violation of international law but also that we 
will continue to stand with Hong Kong. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H. Res. 1033.

HONORING KELLIE MARKEY AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Kellie Markey, the founder and 
executive director of Dorothy’s House in Des 
Moines, as our Iowan of the Week for the 
week of October 16, 2020. 
Raised and educated in Iowa, Kellie moved 
back to Des Moines in 2011 and began volun-
teering in order to reconnect with her commu-
nity. She started working with teen girls at 
Youth Emergency Services & Shelter (YESS) 
and began to learn more about not only the 
nature of abuse against kids in our area, but 
also the extreme challenges these individuals 
face as they age out of care systems and try 
to find success in the world without proper re-
sources.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1063 
November 20, 2020 
Inspired by the hope and optimism of these 
young people who had endured so much 
hardship, Kellie became a foster parent for 
girls who had suffered abuse and sexual as-
sault. The experience opened her eyes further 
to the challenges average people face in help-
ing survivors stay safe and flourish. She also 
realized how little the crimes of sex trafficking 
and sexual exploitation are discussed in our 
communities, despite how present they are— 
and that there wasn’t a place at the time that 
could house survivors and help them with their 
healing journey. That is when Kellie decided to 
found Dorothy’s House. 
Dorothy’s House was established to create 
a safe place in Iowa for survivors of sex traf-
ficking and exploitation to get back on their 
feet and find resources, support, and the 
space they needed to take those next steps. 
They provide both residential and nonresiden-
tial programming, which for many includes 
substance abuse or mental health treatment. 
The mission of Dorothy’s House is to sup-
port the individual. Because of this, they make 
sure to look at someone’s profile and identify 
specifically how they can assist. Common per-
sonal goals and needs include physical health 
care, mental wellbeing, medication support, 
legal support, job skills, and so on. After iden-
tifying what specifically works for the individ-
ual’s plan, Dorothy’s House then surrounds 
that individual with resources to address and 
overcome deficiencies. 
Awareness is a major challenge when it 
comes to combating trafficking. It may be hard 
for people to believe, but the crime of traf-
ficking is prevalent in Iowa. One of the main 
goals for Kellie and her team is to help people 
understand that this crime is happening, 
whether they are aware of it or not. It is under-
reported, yet it still happens right here in our 
towns and neighborhoods. By raising aware-
ness of the issue and working with other advo-
cates and law enforcement, Dorothy’s House 
hopes to make it so difficult to transact that 
traffickers avoid Iowa altogether. 
Kellie has made it clear she was not trying 
to reinvent the wheel on resources when it 
came to Dorothy’s House. We are fortunate 
that Polk County and Iowa have many organi-
zations and groups that help participants re-
member their goals and help them to be inde-
pendent and happy. Since it was founded, 
however, Dorothy’s House has provided a re-
markable opportunity for survivors to heal and 
for the community to stand up against abuse. 
Kellie’s organization has already helped many, 
and I have no doubt her good work will con-
tinue to make a meaningful impact on every-
one Dorothy’s House serves. 
When Iowans identify a problem, they don’t 
walk away from it; they take action and make 
a difference. Kellie felt called upon to work 
with struggling teens, to foster youth in need 
of a stable environment, and to found a 
unique organization dedicated to helping indi-
viduals who have endured unimaginable suf-
fering. That sense of hope and optimism in the 
face of challenge runs deep in Iowans, and 
Kellie is no exception. She and the volunteers 
of Dorothy’s House confront pain and chal-
lenges every day, yet they still manage to see 
silver linings and focus on the good—just like 
those they serve. I want to thank Kellie Mar-
key and her amazing team at Dorothy’s House 
for their compassion, complete dedication, and 
hard work in central Iowa, and it is my pleas-
ure to recognize them as Iowan of the Week. 
IN RECOGNITION OF COLONEL 
DALLAS RALPH HANNA 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Colonel Dallas Ralph 
Hanna and to thank him for his service as a 
veteran of the U.S. Air Force. Colonel Dallas 
Ralph Hanna (Ret.) was born August 14, 1938 
in Salem, Ohio and passed away on Novem-
ber 16, 2020. 
In 1956, Ralph graduated from Salem High 
School and went on to get his undergraduate 
degree from Ohio Wesleyan University. He re-
ceived his master’s degree from Central Michi-
gan University becoming a graduate of Air 
War College and starting his career in the 
United States military. 
Following college, Ralph became a highly 
decorated career Fighter Pilot in the United 
States Air Force. He was involved in both the 
Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War 
and held two FIS command positions, retiring 
as a Colonel. He was stationed everywhere 
from Goose Bay, Labrador to Colorado 
Springs, 
Colorado 
to 
Keflavik, 
Iceland. 
Throughout his career, he flew the F–102, the 
F–4, the F–15, the F–106 and the T–33 but 
one of his favorites was the A–1 Skyraider. 
Ralph became part of the biggest rescue mis-
sion in the Vietnam War flying the A–1 by res-
cuing downed aircrews and controlling the bat-
tlefield until additional reinforcements arrived. 
This mission is one example of the many 
times Ralph put his life on the line to serve his 
fellow servicemen and women and the United 
States of America. 
I had the pleasure of working with and rep-
resenting Ralph in Virginia’s First District, and 
he will be missed dearly. Mr. Hanna was a pa-
triot of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the 
United States. Ralph is survived by his loving 
wife of 50 years, Lou; his two daughters, Nikki 
and Jenny; his son-in-law, Glen; and his two 
granddaughters, Hanna and Marissa. 
His commitment to the ideals that America 
stands for, his good citizenship, self-sacrifice 
and longevity of service are a testimony to all 
that is best about our country. That is evident 
throughout his career. Colonel Dallas Ralph 
Hanna (Ret.) is to be commended for his dedi-
cation and commitment to our nation’s demo-
cratic principles and for the safety of our coun-
try. Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in honoring the life of Colonel 
Dallas Ralph Hanna and thanking him for his 
years of dedicated service to the United 
States of America.

HONORING ARCHBISHOP ABUNE 
MELKETSEDEK 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor His Eminence Archbishop 
Abune Melketsedek and his remarkable life 
committed to faith, knowledge, and compas-
sion. With his passing at the age of 97, he 
leaves behind a legacy of undeniable virtue 
and resolve. 
Born in Megenta Kusquan in the province of 
Gondar, Ethiopia, Archbishop Melketsedek 
was identified at an early age as a prodigious 
student of the Church. At the age of 11, he 
was appointed to the diaconate at Debre 
Tabor Mehanealem, assuming the position of 
deacon for all the churches he visited. With a 
gift for scripture and unwavering devotion, he 
worked his way up through the Church, even-
tually becoming a close friend of Emperor 
Haile Selassie I and a trusted member of his 
cabinet. In 1959, the Emperor appointed the 
Archbishop to Director of Religious Affairs and 
tasked him with shaping a new clergy based 
on merit and integrity. He capitalized on his 
role, while also using his influence to support 
charitable 
organizations 
that 
established 
schools in Addis Ababa and rural parts of Ethi-
opia. 
In 1973, tragedy struck the Archbishop 
when the militant Derg Regime overthrew the 
Emperor and imprisoned and executed many 
of his cabinet and close associates. During the 
upheaval, the Archbishop was thrown in jail for 
over eight years. Amid this painful chapter, he 
remained resolute, spending his time as a 
counselor and spiritual guide for his fellow in-
mates who remember him as, ‘‘a gift from God 
and father of consolation.’’ Upon his release, 
His Eminence could not stand to see the de-
struction of his country and the debasement of 
his Church and began actively speaking out 
against the Derg regime which led to his exile 
from Ethiopia. 
The Archbishop found a new home in 
Berkeley, California where he continued his 
work as General Secretary of The Holy Synod 
of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church. 
From the United States he flew all over the 
world to support and unite the members of the 
Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Archbishop Abune 
Melketsedek is a credit to the State of Cali-
fornia and history will remember him as a 
good-hearted man with an unflinching commit-
ment to his cause.

and Comptroller). Major Reilly is transitioning 
from his present assignment to continue his 
service to our nation and America’s Army. 
A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Major 
Reilly was commissioned from West Virginia 
University’s ROTC Program as an Adjutant 
General Officer. He completed his under-
graduate studies at Waynesburg University 
earning a Bachelor of Arts degree. Major 
Reilly also has a Master’s degree in Legisla-
tive Affairs from George Washington Univer-
sity. 
Major Reilly has served in a broad range of 
assignments during his Army career. He 
served as the Battalion Personnel Officer (S– 
1) for the 3rd Battalion 27th Field Artillery 
Regiment (HIMARS), 18th Fires Brigade (Air-
borne), Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He then 
transitioned to the Brigade Personnel Strength 
Manager for the 18th Fires Brigade (Airborne) 
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 
Upon completion of this assignment, he at-
tended and completed the Adjutant General 
Captains Career Course at Fort Jackson, 
South Carolina. After completion of this course 
and completion of Airborne School, Major 
Reilly was assigned as Battalion Personnel 
Officer for the 1st Battalion 325th Airborne In-
fantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team 
82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North 
Carolina. Following this assignment, Major 
Reilly became the Personnel Strength Man-
ager for the 82nd Airborne Division. Upon 
completion of this job, Major Reilly was se-
lected to serve as a Basic Officer Leader 
Course Instructor for the Adjutant General 
Corps located at the United States Soldier 
Support Institute at Fort Jackson, South Caro-
lina. Major Reilly was then selected for the 
Army’s Office of the Congressional Legislative 
Liaison’s Fellowship Program. 
In 2018, as an Army Congressional Fellow, 
I had the privilege of working with Major Reilly 
in my office for a year and my office, and I 
have worked closely with him during his sub-
sequent assignment as a Congressional Budg-
et Liaison for the U.S. Army. 
Major Reilly worked tirelessly with Members 
of Congress and their staffs to accurately ar-
ticulate the Army’s budget positions to the Ap-
propriations Committees. His professionalism, 
diligence, and commitment to the mission are 
unmatched, and his work both as a fellow and 
as a liaison enabled him to successfully rep-
resent the U.S. Army and the Department of 
Defense to the United States Congress. 
The foundation of Ryan’s military success is 
his family. Raised in Pittsburgh by Jim and 
Karen Reilly as one of two children, particular 
values were established early as paramount: 
service, sacrifice, hard work, and compassion. 
He is a devoted husband to his wife, Sara, 
and a committed father to his son, Jackson, 
and daughter, Amelia. Sara, Jackson, and 
Amelia provide the foundation for Ryan’s serv-
ice. Their attitude of service and care for oth-
ers permeates every organization and activity 
they participate in; true examples of servant 
leaders in the Army and the communities they 
engage. 
Throughout his career, Major Reilly has 
positively impacted soldiers, peers, and supe-
riors. Our country has benefited tremendously 
from his extraordinary leadership, judgment, 
and passion. Today, I applaud Major Reilly for 
a job well done, and I know that my House 
colleagues join me in wishing Ryan and his 
family the very best in their future Army as-
signments and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a genuine 
pleasure to have worked with Major Ryan 
Reilly over the last three years. On behalf of 
a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in 
recognizing and commending Ryan for his 
service to our country, and we wish him all the 
best as he continues his service in the United 
States Army.

member of the U.S.-Japan Congressional 
Caucus and a cosponsor of this resolution, I 
rise in strong support of H. Res. 349, ‘‘Re-
affirming the vital role of the United States- 
Japan alliance in promoting peace, stability, 
and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and 
beyond.’’ 
First and foremost, I wish to thank my col-
league, co-chair of the U.S.-Japan Congres-
sional Caucus, and fellow Texan, Congress-
man CASTRO, for his leadership on this impor-
tant, bipartisan piece of legislation. 
For over 70 years, the partnership between 
the United States and Japan has played a 
vital role in ensuring peace and prosperity in 
Asia and beyond. 
At the core of this crucial relationship is a 
deep and shared commitment to freedom, de-
mocracy and the rule of law. 
Over the years, this partnership has bene-
fitted not only our two countries but also the 
rest of the world. 
From promoting human rights and democ-
racy to combating the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction to improving global health 
to countering human trafficking as well as as-
sisting the victims of conflict and disaster 
worldwide, the U.S.-Japan alliance has re-
sulted in so much good for millions of people 
globally. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a leader on 
this resolution and to voice not only the impor-
tance of this invaluable friendship but also 
draw attention to the significance of this part-
nership in addressing many of the world’s 
challenges. 
Furthermore, the U.S.-Japan alliance is a 
cornerstone of Indo-Pacific stability, and we 
must continue to prioritize this partnership to 
further our shared goals of peace and pros-
perity in the region. 
In the past decade, U.S.-Japan defense co-
operation has improved and evolved in re-
sponse to security challenges, such as the 
North Korean missile threat and the confronta-
tion between Japan and China over disputed 
islands. 
I commend the Japanese leadership for 
deepening 
defense 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United States for the past two decades as part 
of their efforts to ensure a fair balance of 
power in the Indo-Pacific. 
Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that the U.S. 
and Japan continue to collaborate and pursue 
our shared, positive vision for Asia that offers 
a better path than authoritarianism, predatory 
economics and geopolitical competition. 
Japan’s importance as a democratic and 
economic partner cannot be understated nor 
should it be ignored. 
With uncertainty arising around the world, 
this alliance is more important than ever be-
fore, and I look forward to building on our dec-
ades-long partnership by further strengthening 
our ties and ensuring the safety and prosperity 
of both nations.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
DOWNTOWN 
INDY, 
INC. 
FOUNDER TAMARA ZAHN 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Ta-
mara Zahn, the founder of Indianapolis Down-
town Inc. now known as Downtown Indy, Inc., 
an organization tasked with developing, man-
aging and marketing downtown Indianapolis. 
Known as Indy’s ‘‘greatest cheerleader,’’ her 
loss will be felt far and wide across the city 
where she worked as a real estate analyst 
and consultant before establishing Indianapolis 
Downtown Inc. Her vision and enthusiasm and 
well-known contagious pride in the city led to 
national recognition for outstanding urban revi-
talization, development and beautification. She 
was an advocate for the city she loved and a 
valued mentor to many.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1065 
November 20, 2020 
Tamara was born on June 22, 1953, in Fort 
Wayne, Indiana, to Phyllis and Bob Zahn. She 
earned her BA from Indiana University and 
launched her career in real estate in Indianap-
olis. She consulted on large scale projects and 
played key roles with the Simon Property 
Group as it developed the Mall of America in 
Minneapolis and Circle Centre Mall in Indian-
apolis. In 1993, she became the first president 
of Indianapolis Downtown, Inc. (IDI), where 
she served until 2012. During her years at IDI, 
Tamara parlayed her real estate experience 
and marketing insights to help Indianapolis ex-
pand its ability to host major conventions, 
events such as Several NCAA Final Four and 
the NFL’s 2012 Super Bowl. She launched the 
Cultural District program, the Marge Tarplee 
Downtown Beautification Fund, and chaired 
the Indianapolis Cultural Trail. She facilitated 
the United Way’s Executive Women’s Leader-
ship class in 2012, and in 2013, she was 
elected chair of the International Downtown 
Association (IDA). IDA provides tools, intel-
ligence and strategies for creating healthy and 
dynamic centers that anchor the well-being of 
towns, cities and regions of the world. 
Tamara received multiple awards throughout 
her time leading in the State of Indiana includ-
ing IBJ Inaugural Class of 40 Under 40 
(1993); Olympic torch bearer (1996); IBJ’s In-
augural class of Most Influential Women 
(1997); IUPUI Notable Woman (2000); NUVO 
Cultural Vision (2012); Downtown Champion 
(2014) and in 2004 she was awarded the 
State of Indiana’s highest civilian award, The 
Sagamore of the Wabash. 
Tamara was known for her infectious laugh, 
upbeat attitude, strong vision and love for peo-
ple. She was a mentor, a leader and an advo-
cate for the growth of Indianapolis, and for 
women and equality. I admired Tamara and 
was blessed to count her among my friends. 
Tamara Zahn passed away unexpectedly on 
October 1, 2020. I join her beloved husband of 
28 years, Tim Wade, her son, Tim Wade, Jr., 
and brother, Tom Zahn as well as countless 
Hoosiers in mourning the loss of a great lead-
er and friend. The City of Indianapolis as well 
as the State of Indiana will miss her remark-
able talents and loving personality but her leg-
acy will live on as the city continues to flourish 
on the path she created.

MALCOLM NELSON 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Malcolm Nelson for his 
work as the Ombudsman for the Energy Em-
ployees Occupational Illness Compensation 
Program and to congratulate him on his retire-
ment. 
Since his appointment in 2006, Nelson has 
dedicated his career to helping former nuclear 
weapons workers navigate a complex claims 
process. During his time as Ombudsman, Nel-
son served with compassion and an unparal-
leled understanding of the law. He consistently 
served as a resource to claimants about the 
adjudication process and listened to their con-
cerns in order to make recommendations to 
improve the program. 
Accessibility was an important part of Nel-
son’s role as the Ombudsman. He often trav-
eled to claimants, attended outreach town 
halls, and even held his own town halls in 
more remote areas like Canyon City, Colorado 
to make sure all claimants were being 
reached. Former Rocky Flats workers in my 
district were well served by Nelson. He was 
even nominated for the Service to America 
Medals by the Alliance of Nuclear Worker Ad-
vocacy Groups in 2018. 
During his over 40-year tenure in govern-
ment, Nelson also served as general counsel 
and as acting administrative appeals judge for 
DOL’s Benefits Review Board, where he as-
sisted with the appeals process under the 
Black Lung Benefits Act and the Longshore 
and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. 
While I will miss Malcolm Nelson as he 
leaves this important post, I wish him luck in 
his retirement and I thank him for his many 
years of service to our nuclear weapons work-
ers across this country.

HONORING CAMERON GRABER AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing a dedicated and community- 
minded young man from Treynor as this 
week’s Iowan of the Week. Cameron Graber, 
a current student at the University of Iowa, 
was recently honored with the 2020 Spirit of 
the Relay Award from the American Cancer 
Society for the Iowa/Nebraska Area. 
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month 
and an important time to remember the work 
we still have ahead of us to defeat this dis-
ease. According to the ACS, one in eight 
women will be diagnosed with invasive breast 
cancer in their lifetime. The Spirit of the Relay 
Award recognizes people who have gone 
above and beyond to help the American Can-
cer Society in its mission to save lives, cele-
brate lives, and lead the fight for a world with-
out cancer. ACS has worked tirelessly to con-
duct research, educate, and provide support 
for all who have been, or may be touched by 
cancer. Since he was four years old, Cameron 
has volunteered with the American Cancer So-
ciety. His mother, Amy, inspired him and took 
him to his first Relay for Life at that young 
age. She’s been an encouraging force for 
Cameron to continue volunteering within his 
community ever since. That first event set 
Cameron on a path to make a difference 
through volunteering with the American Can-
cer Society. As a young man, he has worked 
as a Team Captain and helped oversee and 
coordinate many aspects of publicity and mar-
keting for Relay for Life and other fundraisers 
that bring in critical donations at ACS. Cam-
eron has also carried his dedication to the 
cause with him while attending the University 
of Iowa. He is currently the Co-Chair of the 
National Campus Leadership Team that helps 
coordinate strategy and direction to the colle-
giate and high school fundraising programs 
across the country. He’s a leader in the fight 
for millions of people in Iowa and across the 
globe who will be diagnosed. 
Cameron’s dedication to volunteering and 
supporting the ACS is another example of the 
hard work, selflessness, and fortitude of 
Iowans. Growing up in a small, rural commu-
nity like Treynor helped to shape Cameron’s 
work ethic and his continued dedication to the 
American Cancer Society’s cause has instilled 
in him the importance of helping others. It will 
be exciting to see how this young man con-
tinues to grow through his college education 
and beyond. 
I am proud to recognize Cameron for his 
devotion to supporting his community and 
causes that make a meaningful, local impact. 
I am even prouder knowing there are so many 
young people across southwest Iowa who are 
investing in their communities with this same 
passion and spirit. It is my honor to share 
Cameron Graber’s story and recognize him as 
our Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING URBAN PARTNERS 
LOS ANGELES 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 20, 2020 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Urban Partners Los Angeles 
(UPLA), a nonprofit in the Koreatown/Westlake 
neighborhoods dedicated to providing food 
and educational resources to underserved and 
underprivileged communities in the city. 
Since the organization’s founding in 1995, 
Urban Partners’ free programs and services— 
everything from educational courses and tutor-
ing to food distributions and assistance—have 
filled critical gaps and addressed the needs of 
Angelinos throughout Los Angeles. UPLA has 
since become a critical lifeline to the commu-
nity. 
This could not ring truer than during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, where UPLA’s staff and 
volunteers were on the frontlines, distributing 
over 9,000 bags of groceries to more than 
4,500 families during the onset of the crisis. 
Even now, volunteers tirelessly work to dis-
tribute over 50,000 pounds of food to 1,000 
families, ensuring no one leaves empty hand-
ed. 
It is also because of those at the helm of 
UPLA, like Executive Director and Board 
President Rochelle McAdam and volunteer Ex-
ecutive Director and Board Member Trinity 
Tran, and their dedication of heart and hand to 
the community that food-insecure individuals 
and families in Los Angeles are not left behind 
and do not go hungry. 
We are truly grateful to UPLA’s board mem-
bers, staff, and volunteers for their fierce ad-
vocacy of those the organization serves, their 
empowering work of community building, and 
the love of community they continue to show 
week after week.
