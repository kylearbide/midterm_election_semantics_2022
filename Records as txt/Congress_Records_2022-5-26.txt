The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our Father, we wait to serve 
You as You desire. May we do what is 
right and trust You completely. 
Lord, make us alert to the needs of 
those lives You seek to touch, pro-

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
H.R. 350 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today, the Senate will have a chance to 
act on a pernicious issue that has re-
cently become an increasingly preva-
lent component in America’s gun vio-
lence epidemic: the evil spread of 
White supremacy and domestic ter-
rorism. 
In the past 2 weeks, the United 
States has endured two of the most 
traumatic mass shootings that we have 
seen in recent history. In my home 
State of New York, in the beloved city 
of Buffalo, 10 Black Americans were 
gunned down in broad daylight by a 
White supremacist armed with an AR– 
15 and whose mind was poisoned by on-
line conspiracies—White supremacist 
conspiracies. 
And 2 days ago, 19 children—19 chil-
dren: 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10-year- 
olds, kids on the verge of beginning 
summer, kids with their entire lives 
ahead of them; we saw them holding up 
their trophies and proudly in their T-

May 26, 2022 
shirts, and a few hours later they were 
gone—slaughtered 
in 
the 
predomi-
nantly Latino town of Uvalde, TX. Two 
teachers, including a mother of four, 
were killed alongside them. Many more 
were injured and remain in critical 
condition. 
It was the worst school shooting in 
America since Sandy Hook. Last night, 
I looked at the pictures of each of 
those kids online, and I wept—taken 
from us, taken from their families 
through senseless gun violence. I can’t 
stop thinking about the parents, too, 
who lost their kids. I can’t stop imag-
ining the paralyzing horror of being 
one of the parents showing up to the 
school after the shooting, wondering 
where their kid was—the anxiety that 
will live with these parents forever— 
forced to wait hours before a DNA 
test—a DNA test—confirmed that their 
son or daughter was gone. I cannot 
imagine a hell—a hell—worse than 
that. 
And these families, my colleagues, 
don’t want thoughts and prayers. They 
want their elected leaders to respond 
to their suffering. They don’t want to 
be lifted up. They don’t want good in-
tentions. They want something to 
change. They want results. 
Yet the MAGA Republicans don’t 
want to get results. They are ossified 
in their opposition to any action on 
gun safety. No matter the cause of vio-
lence and no matter the cost on fami-
lies, nothing seems to move them. 
Yesterday, after Beto O’Rourke con-
fronted Texas Governor Abbott’s press 
conference, the MAGA Governor gave 
some empty platitudes about healing 
and hope. He asked people to put their 
agendas aside and think about someone 
other than themselves. 
My God, how dare he. What an abso-
lute fraud the Governor of Texas is. 
And this is the same Governor Abbott 
who 
tomorrow—tomorrow—will 
go 
speak at the NRA convention in Hous-
ton. 
Governor Abbott, will you ask your 
MAGA buddies and your NRA pals to 
put aside their agendas and think of 
someone other than themselves like 
you asked the families to do? Will you 
ask the gun manufacturing reps who 
swarm over the NRA convention to put 
aside their agendas and think about 
someone other than themselves? Of 
course not. 
The Governor—Governor Abbott—is 
more likely to outline some new plans 
to further loosen gun restrictions. No 
amount of bloodshed seems to be 
enough for MAGA Republicans. 
This Nation is enraged as well as 
being exhausted. It has been through 
this over and over and over again over 
the last two decades. People are sick of 
mourning again and again while listen-
ing to the same string of hollow words 
from 
the 
MAGA Republicans that 
never lead to action. 
So in a few moments, the Senate will 
have a chance to vote on one important 
cause of gun violence. The legislation 
before the Senate today is the Domes-
tic Terrorism Protection Act, which I 
scheduled for a vote earlier this week 
before what happened in Uvalde oc-
curred. It was done to respond to the 
massacre in the supermarket in Buf-
falo. 
The bill is so important because the 
mass shooting in Buffalo was an act of 
domestic terrorism. We need to call it 
what it is: domestic terrorism. It was 
terrorism that fed off the poison of 
conspiracy theories like ‘‘White re-
placement theory’’; terrorism that left 
10 people dead, a community forever 
torn asunder. This bill will give the 
government the tools to monitor, find, 
and arrest these evil actors before they 
have a chance to inflict violence on 
their communities. I thank my col-
league 
Senator 
DURBIN
for 
cham-
pioning this bill. 
I have been going to bed every night 
thinking about the families I met in 
Buffalo in the aftermath of the shoot-
ing. I think about this little 3-year-old 
boy. He lost his dad who went to that 
Tops grocery store to buy him a birth-
day cake—a birthday cake for his son. 
That little boy is going to live with 
that the rest of his life—the rest of his 
life. I think about all the families im-
pacted by other racially motivated 
shootings over the year. Buffalo, cer-
tainly, 
unfortunately, 
wasn’t 
the 
first—Charleston, El Paso, Pittsburgh, 
Atlanta, and so many others; the 
shooting of Asian Americans, Hispanic 
Americans, 
gay 
Americans, 
Jewish 
Americans, as well as Black Americans 
all because of this horrible ‘‘White re-
placement theory.’’ 
So today is the day we can begin to 
debate on how to make these shootings 
less likely. And there is an additional 
benefit to moving forward today. It is a 
chance to have a larger debate in con-
sidering amendments for gun safety 
legislation in general, not just for 
those motivated by racism, as vital as 
it is to do that. 
I know that many Members on the 
other side hold views that are different 
than the views on this side of the aisle. 
So let us move on this bill. Let us pro-
ceed and then they can bring them to 
the floor. 
Senator JOHNSON brought a bill to 
the floor yesterday about school secu-
rity practices. I didn’t agree with the 
bill, and I don’t think it is the answer 
to mass shootings. We don’t need more 
guns in the schools. There were secu-
rity guards at the supermarket in Buf-
falo, police and security at the school 
in Uvalde, but we can debate it. The 
same with Senator CRUZ’s plan to limit 
schools to only one door. Fire marshals 
and tactical experts totally and vehe-
mently disagree. Let’s debate it. 
And there are other Senators with 
other proposals—proposals that come 
from our side of the aisle—background 
checks, red flag laws, the Charleston 
loophole, assault weapons, and other 
ideas. 
Look, I know the chances of getting 
10 votes on this bill are small, unfortu-
nately, given the influence of MAGA 
Republicans. Many Republicans have 
made their opposition clear. Again, 
there are a lot of MAGA Republicans 
for whom no amount of gun violence— 
whether it is domestic terrorism, a 
school shooting, a neighborhood shoot-
ing, or something else—will ever— 
ever—convince them to take any ac-
tion. 
If Republicans obstruct debate today, 
we are prepared to have an honest and 
realistic discussion, conversation, ne-
gotiation for a little more time to see 
what they can come to the table with. 
We are under no illusions that this 
will be easy. We have been burned in 
the past when Republicans promised to 
debate only for them to break their 
promise. But even with long odds, the 
issue is so important, so raw to the 
American people, so personal to count-
less families who are missing children, 
that we must pursue that opportunity. 
We also know that the American peo-
ple—as many as 80 percent or 90 per-
cent—support gun safety legislation. 
We have an obligation to pursue 
every path and explore every realistic 
option to break the cycle of suffering 
and inaction. Not trying everything is 
not acceptable to the families who 
have lost their loved ones to our Na-
tion’s gun epidemic. To those beautiful 
children we see pictures of in the news-
paper and their families, we have to try 
everything. We must not leave a single 
stone unturned. 
Senator MURPHY, who has been such 
a strong and valiant leader within our 
caucus on gun safety legislation and 
who has seen the suffering firsthand of 
the families at Sandy Hook whom he 
has become very close to, has asked for 
space to see what progress can be done 
with Senate Republicans. 
Neither he nor I is under an illusion 
that this will be easy; it will not. But 
his view, my view, and the over-
whelming view of our caucus is that we 
need to give it a short amount of time 
to try. There are others, too, in this 
caucus reaching out to our Republican 
colleagues 
as 
we 
speak—Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, Senator COONS, Senator 
HEINRICH, Senator MANCHIN, and oth-
ers. We have also been in talks with 
our allies across gun advocacy groups, 
and we all have a strong and burning 
desire to see something real, something 
tangible come across, come together 
here in the Senate. 
Again, none of us are under any illu-
sions that it will be easy. None of us 
want to let this drag out. We know all 
too well the vice grip that the NRA and 
MAGA wing hold over the GOP, and we 
have been burned in the past. America 
has been burned in the past. 
After the shootings in El Paso and 
Dayton 3 years ago, the Republican 
leader promised red flag laws and back-
ground checks would be front and cen-
ter in the Senate debate. He didn’t put 
them on the floor, and Republicans did 
nothing. But that is not an excuse for 
Democrats not to try. Too many fami-
lies have suffered, too many kids have 
been lost, too many communities have

been destroyed. This is too important 
not to explore every option. 
I want to be clear. This is not an in-
vite to negotiating indefinitely. Make 
no mistake about it, if these negotia-
tions do not bear fruit in a short period 
of time, the Senate will vote on gun 
safety legislation. Let me repeat. If 
these negotiations do not bear any 
fruit, the Senate will vote on gun safe-
ty legislation when we return. But our 
hope, even amidst our deep skepticism, 
is, during this week, Democrats and 
Republicans, at long last, will come to 
agree on something meaningful that 
will reduce gun violence in a real way 
in America. Senator MURPHY and some 
of our colleagues believe that it is 
worth a chance, and we will give it 
that chance. 
Unfortunately, though, Republicans 
haven’t come forward in too long a 
time. There hasn’t been this debate in 
too long a time. But even though it 
hasn’t happened in too long a time, we 
feel an obligation to give it a chance. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In America, infla-
tion has topped 5 percent every month 
for the past year. The consumer price 
index continues to hover at levels our 
economy hasn’t seen in four decades. 
As we head into Memorial Day week-
end, the American people have become 
reluctant experts in its painful, real- 
life effects. 
The average working family is now 
spending the equivalent of $5,000 a year 
on gas money. A year ago, the number 
was $2,800. Nationwide, gas prices have 
risen 46.9 cents just in the last month, 
and in Kentucky, they have risen actu-
ally even faster. Here’s a quote from 
one of my constituents: ‘‘I’m getting 
taken full advantage of,’’ said one driv-
er in Lexington. 
Another said: ‘‘It costs so much to 
fill up I have to do it half a tank at a 
time now.’’ 
But according to President Biden, it 
is all part of what he calls an ‘‘incred-
ible transition.’’ Well, that is a heck of 
a way to describe his administration’s 
war on the most affordable, reliable, 
and abundant forms of energy in our 
country, forcing fuel prices so high 
that it requires Americans to transi-
tion to more expensive cars with sup-
ply chains controlled primarily by 
China and other hostile regimes with 
lower labor and environmental stand-
ards is not my idea of incredible. 
But pain at the pump is only one of 
the tangled consequences of Wash-
ington Democrats’ radical policies and 
reckless spending. Depending on where 
you are trying to go, higher fuel costs 
are hurting Americans’ ability to enjoy 
major summer traditions. Rental car 
costs have jumped to 10.4 percent in 
the past year. Hotel rooms are going 
for 22.6 percent more, and plane tickets 
are up 33.3 percent. 
Of course, millions of Americans are 
having a hard enough time paying for 
basic expenses, let alone planning sum-
mer vacations. Grocery stores now 
stock painful surprises on every aisle. 
Ground coffee is 14.7 percent more ex-
pensive than it was a year ago; eggs, up 
22.6 percent. Anyone wanting to grill a 
bacon cheeseburger over Memorial Day 
weekend will find ground beef up 15 
percent and bacon up 18 percent com-
pared to only 1 year ago. 
And utility bills now arrive with gut 
punches. For ratepayers in New Eng-
land, electricity rates are projected to 
cost 16.4 percent more this summer 
than last summer. Everywhere they 
turn, American families are having to 
pare back expectations, put dreams on 
hold, and make bitter sacrifices. 
It is no longer a shocking scandal; it 
is just normal life in Democrats’ 
version of America: harder to fuel the 
tank, harder to feed the family, harder 
to get by. 
TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER M. KUSKOWSKI 
Madam President, on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, 9 years and a couple of 
months 
ago, 
an 
impressive 
young 
woman interviewed for a position in 
my office over in the Russell Building. 
She had worked for her home State 
senator out of college. At that point, 
she sharpened her chops on the House 
side. I knew 5 minutes into the meeting 
with Jennifer Kuskowski that we had 
found someone very special. 
And now that young staffer from a 
decade back is departing the Senate as 
a commanding policy expert and one of 
my most indispensable advisors. 
Jen began as my legislative assistant 
for healthcare. In less than 2 years, she 
earned a no-brainer promotion to be 
the legislative director for my whole 
personal office, a sort of player-coach 
overseeing all policy areas. For a cou-
ple of years, Jen briefly betrayed us 
and obtained committee experience 
with Chairman Hatch at the Senate Fi-
nance Committee. But we soon stole 
her back for my leadership office here 
in the Capitol. 
For more than 3 years, she has been 
my crucial point person on some of the 
most complex issues we face—from 
healthcare to education to tech and 
telecom. She is the consummate pro-
fessional, reliable, calm, clear under 
pressure. She knows her portfolio like 
the back of her hand, and Jen genu-
inely loves the legislative process. As 
her colleagues playfully reminded her 
with some frequency, Jen is a policy 
nerd’s policy nerd. 
Now, don’t get me wrong, Jen’s not 
naive. She has the realism and tenacity 
of a grizzled veteran, but even as a top 
staffer who works directly with Sen-
ators and coordinates across commit-
tees, Jen has still got the same ear-
nestness as the young woman I met a 
decade back. And I think I know why. 
I think Jen Kuskowski loves mastering 
thorny policy issues because she under-
stands that policy impacts people. 
In between her first and second stint 
on the Hill, Jen served in the Peace 
Corps, working on health issues in Ec-
uador. That is hands-on experience you 
never forget. 
And towards the other bookend of 
her Senate service, Jen spent the 
coronavirus pandemic first as an ex-
pectant mother and then with a new-
born. She knew what was at stake as 
she tracked the science and helped as-
semble the Senate’s historic, bipar-
tisan response. 
Jen has honed expertise in issues 
that touch families’ lives very directly. 
And with that expertise, she has done 
unbelievably well. She was an early 
driving force to focus Congress on the 
opioid epidemic. She was alert to the 
plague of substance abuse years before 
anybody in Washington was even dis-
cussing it. 
Jen was the central player in my ef-
fort to raise the minimum tobacco age 
to 21. She played a huge role in struc-
turing the historic relief for hospitals 
and providers that kept health systems 
above water in the early weeks of the 
COVID crisis. 
She was a key quarterback as we 
crafted support for vaccines and thera-
peutics that got America back on of-
fense. Across many years, across many 
issues, Jen Kuskowski’s expertise and 
professionalism have literally saved 
lives throughout Kentucky and across 
America. It is not an exaggeration; it 
is literally true. Families across the 
Commonwealth and across the Nation 
that will never meet Jen have bene-
fited from the fact that she has been 
one of the most reliable closers on Cap-
itol Hill. When an issue lands in her 
court, it gets resolved, period. 
Now, saying Jen cares about policy 
because she cares about people might 
sound like sort of a sappy cliche, but 
everybody in the Senate can attest 
there is nothing remotely sappy or 
‘‘Hallmark card’’ about her. Jen’s sar-
castic sense of humor is world-class. 
She does not suffer fools. She pursues 
goals with bulldog determination, and 
a competitive fire burning below the 
surface. But all this coexists with a 
deep kindness and care for others. It is 
really a very special package. 
Jen has been the likeliest member of 
our team to seek out a colleague who is 
having a hard day and offer a pep talk 
and the likeliest person to aim a witty 
barb at a friend who is feeling overcon-
fident and needs to be taken down a 
peg. Any team would be lucky to have 
either someone as diligent and profes-
sional as Jen or somebody as compas-
sionate or someone as wickedly funny. 
It has been our special blessing to have 
all three in one person. 
So as you can see, Jen has rendered 
the Senate a special and unique serv-
ice. So I am happy to report the insti-
tution has repaid Jen in a special and 
unique way as well. When we first met 
Jen, she was Jennifer Conklin, but she 
leaves the Senate partnered to her hus-
band Officer Andrew Kuskowski of the 
United States Capitol Police. They are 
proud parents of little Zachary. 
And after a decade of late-night nego-
tiations and weekend conference calls,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2716 
May 26, 2022 
our friend is excited to strike out and 
tackle new challenges. 
So, Jen, I am so grateful for your 
outstanding service. We know you will 
continue to be a force of nature wher-
ever you go, and you will keep serving 
the common good, just in new and dif-
ferent ways. 
You have done your family proud. 
You have done me proud. And I hope 
you are proud. Your fine service has 
literally saved lives and changed our 
country for the better. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The junior Senator from Ken-
tucky. 
H.R. 350 
Mr. PAUL. Today, we will have a bill 
before us ostensibly titled and osten-
sibly about the subject of domestic ter-
rorism. 
But this bill would be more accu-
rately called the Democrat plan to 
brand and insult our police and soldiers 
as White supremacists and neo-Nazis. 
How insulting. 
I have met our Nation’s policemen. I 
have visited with policemen across 
Kentucky, through our big cities and 
small, and I have not met one police-
man motivated or consumed with any 
kind of sort of racial rage. What I have 
met are proud policemen and women 
who care about the people that they 
protect in our society, but also who 
care about their fellow officers. 
I have not met one policeman who 
would not defend their partner: Black, 
White, Jewish, Christian, Muslim. I 
don’t see the kind of sort of insulting 
rage that the Democrats have for our 
police. 
I have met our country’s young sol-
diers and marines. I don’t meet racists. 
I don’t meet White supremacists. I 
don’t meet neo-Nazis. I meet young 
men and women who are courageous 
enough to defend our country. And 
what an insult it is to put a bill before 
this House that says: Oh, somehow our 
marines are consumed with White su-
premacy and neo-Nazism. How insult-
ing. 
In fact, I don’t think you could look 
at a group of young men and women 
who are more adapted to the times, 
who are more accepting of their fellow 
man. And I have never—I have never— 
heard of a marine saying: Oh, I am not 
going to carry my fallen colleague out 
because he is African American. I have 
never heard of an African-American 
marine saying: I am not going to carry 
out my fellow marine because they are 
White. 
If there is any kind of grouping in 
our country more accustomed to treat-
ing people because they are your fellow 
soldier and your friend, it is the mili-
tary. To insinuate that the military is 
consumed with White supremacy is an 
insult. To insinuate that our soldiers 
are somehow these terrible people, 
these neo-Nazis and White suprema-
cists, that we are going to get a new 
government Agency to police the ma-
rines—the marines are a proud part of 
our military. Our soldiers are a proud 
part of our country. These are the peo-
ple who do not see color, who do not 
see race, who do not see religion. These 
are the people who don’t leave their 
fallen. 
Do you think the marines go around 
saying ‘‘Oh, we are going to leave our 
fallen if they have a certain race or re-
ligion’’? You don’t see that. The ma-
rines, the soldiers in our country, the 
people who defend our country, the 
people who defend and love our coun-
try, are the least consumed with any 
kind of notion of race. How insulting. 
This bill states as if it were a fact in 
the beginning of section 5 that this bill 
will create ‘‘an interagency task force 
to analyze and combat White suprema-
cist and neo-Nazi infiltration of the 
uniformed services and federal law en-
forcement.’’ This is not just an insult 
to your local police or to the Marines 
or to the Army and to the Navy; this is 
an insult to the FBI; it is an insult to 
the Capitol Police. This bill says that 
they have been infiltrated. This says 
that our police are consumed with 
some kind of race rage. 
It is untrue, and it is slander, and it 
is scandalous, but it is predictable. 
This is the party that wants to defund 
the police. But this party not only 
wants to defund the police, they think 
the police are full of hatred and racism. 
It is not true. 
Every policeman in our country, 
every soldier in our country should 
look at this bill and say: Who are these 
people? White supremacy and neo-Na-
zism infiltration of the Marines? That 
is not true. It is an insult to every ma-
rine in our country. It is an insult to 
every soldier in our country. It is an 
insult to every policeman in our coun-
try. It is an insult to the Capitol Po-
lice. 
I don’t see this in our country. I ac-
tually see our armed services as prob-
ably one of the areas where people 
intermix regardless of race and religion 
better than any segment. These are our 
young men and women who live in 
close quarters in barracks. These are 
our young men and women who go 
overseas. These are our young men and 
women who have given arms and legs, 
and I don’t hear examples—I don’t 
know of an example of some guy who 
says: Oh, yeah, we were blown up by an 
IED, but we decided to leave that guy 
because he is of a different race. How 
insulting. 
So you are going to have a task force 
to investigate our soldiers. This is a 
Federal task force that is going to go 
in and investigate our soldiers for 
White supremacy—I guess read their 
emails, read what websites they go to— 
because the implication is they are 
guilty until they can prove themselves 
innocent. That is what this will set up. 
It will set up more government Agen-
cies that presume your guilt. But it is 
an insult to our armed services, to our 
police, and to anybody who works in 
law enforcement. 
One might well ask if Democrats now 
believe that the U.S. military and Fed-
eral, State, and local police depart-
ments are all corrupted. Are there 
White supremacists and neo-Nazis run-
ning around our country? 
Look, when I visit even the larger 
cities in Kentucky, when I visit the 
Louisville Police Department, guess 
what. I see African Americans and 
Whites working together and Brown, 
Hispanic—whatever you want to call 
people—all working together. I see 
high-ranking people in our department 
who are African American. I don’t see 
that 
everybody 
is 
running 
around 
hating each other. I see Black officers 
and White officers who work together 
as partners, who care about each other 
and would defend to the last breath 
their partner if they were shot in the 
line of duty. I have seen the officers 
who have been shot, Black and White. 
I don’t see any of them saying: Oh, 
yeah, well, we are not going to do any-
thing because that person is of a cer-
tain race. 
This bill is an insult to every police 
officer in this country. This bill is an 
insult to everyone in our armed serv-
ices. This bill says that the armed serv-
ices have been infiltrated by White su-
premacy. 
So if you are a soldier in our country, 
if you are a policeman in our country, 
you need to let your Congressman or 
Senator know that you are not a White 
supremacist and that it is an insult for 
the Democrats to call you a White su-
premacist. It is an insult for the Demo-
crats to say our police force is full of 
White supremacy, that our armed serv-
ices is full of this. 
Everybody in this country who works 
in law enforcement should be outraged 
by this bill and should respond and say: 
No, that is not me, and that is not any 
of my colleagues. That is not what the 
Kentucky police force is about. That is 
not what the National Guard is about. 
That is not what the Marines are 
about. What an insult. What an insult. 
So what do they do? They set up a 
new Department in Homeland Secu-
rity. Isn’t Homeland Security Federal 
too? Have they not been infiltrated as 
well? 
See, the implication of this bill is 
that all people are bad, that there is 
this great and worrisome thing that is 
infecting America—when the opposite 
is true. 
I was born in the 1960s. Every decade 
has gotten better. People get along bet-
ter. We have more intermarriage be-
tween races. We have more integration 
within churches. I see less and less of 
this that everybody is saying is now in-
fecting us. 
But they don’t realize that they are 
insulting everyone. They are insulting 
the police. They are insulting our ma-
rines. They are insulting our armed 
services. 
The bill creates two other Depart-
ments. These essentially are Depart-
ments that are going to be the thought 
police of the military. 
We just took down the ‘‘Ministry of 
Truth,’’ which was in the Department

of Homeland Security. It took a couple 
of weeks for them to finally be 
ashamed that they were going to try to 
censor speech, and the Biden adminis-
tration has canceled it or at least put 
it on pause. But this bill will create 
two other Agencies, two other thought 
police offices at the Department of 
Justice and the FBI—seems like a self- 
defeating choice since elsewhere in the 
bill, we are told that Federal law en-
forcement is completely infiltrated by 
White supremacists and neo-Nazis. 
But, again, none of the bill makes 
sense. It doesn’t make sense because it 
was a bill that was never intended to 
become law and won’t. It is a dumb 
Washington 
talking 
points 
memo 
masquerading as legislation, but it is 
also a grave insult to anyone involved 
in law enforcement, anyone involved in 
the military. But congressional Demo-
crats have gotten so radical, so ex-
treme, so out of touch with the Amer-
ican people, that when they read it, 
they think this is something worth-
while to do. It is a messaging bill for 
today. 
This bill will fail today, though, be-
cause the Democrats’ message—hate 
the police; defund the police; the police 
are terrible people; the military are 
terrible people—to slander the military 
and the police as racist and White su-
premacist has been roundly rejected by 
the American people and will continue 
to be. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
later on today, we are going to be vot-
ing on a Congressional Review Act 
dealing with the title 42—actually, 
more specifically, the asylum rule 
dealing with what is happening at our 
southwest border right now. 
Let me first say something I don’t 
normally say on this floor. I am 
pleased the Biden administration is 
trying to address this. It is a step 
that—someone in the administration 
has noticed there is a problem with the 
asylum rule, and they are trying to ad-
dress it. This solution will not fix the 
problem, but at least we are working 
on the problem. 
I can say this to the Biden adminis-
tration and to this body: If we do not 
legislatively fix the asylum rule, what 
is happening on our southern border 
will never get better. We have to ad-
dress what is the problem there. It is 
not that there are root causes in Cen-
tral America. We are the United States 
of America; everyone in the world 
wants to be here. If all you have to do 
is cross the border and say the magic 
words ‘‘I have credible fear’’ and the 
Biden administration hands you a piece 
of paper and you are in the country for 
the next 8 years—8 years—until your 
hearing, the whole world is going to 
keep coming here. 
Now, right now, literally right now, 
we have 8,000 people a day who are ille-
gally crossing our border—8,000. 
Last summer, in the midst of all the 
chaos, when all the cameras were fo-
cused on our southern border, there 
were 6,000 people a day who were ille-
gally crossing our border. It is literally 
worse now than it was a year ago, but 
the cameras have all moved on and said 
‘‘nothing to see here’’ when it con-
tinues to be able to get worse literally 
every month. Last month, a quarter- 
million people illegally crossed the 
border—a quarter-million. Half of those 
were turned away with title 42 author-
ity, which the Biden administration is 
trying to end to allow everyone to be 
able to come across the border. 
But this asylum rule gives me some 
sense of hope that they are at least 
identifying what the problem is and 
trying to start working on it. Here is 
the problem, though: The way that this 
rule is actually set up, almost every 
negative determination made under 
this expedited asylum process gets ap-
pealed under the normal process any-
way. So while they are creating an ex-
pedited process, all they have to do is 
say ‘‘I disagree with the expedited 
process,’’ and they get through the 
long, protracted, 8-year process any-
way. It doesn’t solve the problem. 
So while the executive branch is try-
ing to do something, their ‘‘some-
thing’’ that they are doing doesn’t ac-
tually fix the issue. We have to change 
this issue in law. 
Secretary Mayorkas was on the Hill 2 
weeks ago. He came and presented the 
new plan in place for what they are 
going to do on the border. Part of that 
plan was this new asylum rule. But 
when you read the summary, at the 
very end of it—they go through all 
their details, these high-level points of 
six different areas where they are going 
to work to be able to decrease. At the 
end of it, the summary statement ends 
with ‘‘Despite our best efforts, we an-
ticipate an increase in migration.’’ 
What they are saying is, the policies 
that they currently have in place are 
going to continue to increase migra-
tion even with things like this new 
asylum rule that they are trying to be 
able to put in place because they know 
this doesn’t actually fix the problem. 
MPP, the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ pro-
gram that a Federal court has required 
them to maintain—they are doing MPP 
only in such a way to say to the Fed-
eral courts: We are doing something. 
We have 8,000 people a day who are il-
legally crossing the border. We have 
about 2,000 people a month whom they 
are putting through the MPP program. 
We have 8,000 people a day who are ille-
gally crossing the border. Currently, 
ICE is deporting 203 people a day. With 
8,000 people a day crossing and 203 peo-
ple actually being deported, you see 
the math here. They are not trying to 
stop the flow. They are not trying to 
disincentivize this. 
We need to actually get serious about 
this. So, yes, I am going to support a 
Congressional Review Act on this indi-
vidual piece because it doesn’t actually 
fix the problem. Let’s actually sit down 
and fix the problem actually in the 
statute. That is what needs to be done. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise to 
support this Congressional Review Act 
resolution of disapproval of the rule re-
cently published by the Department of 
Homeland Security and the Executive 
Office for Immigration Review entitled 
‘‘Procedures for Credible Fear Screen-
ing and Consideration of Asylum, With-
holding of Removal, and CAT Protec-
tion Claims by Asylum Officers.’’ 
Madam President, we are currently 
experiencing an unprecedented crisis 
on our southern border. As of April of 
this year, 4 months into 2022, over 1 
million illegal crossings have been en-
countered at our southern border. And 
with the administration fighting the 
migrant protection protocols and will-
ing to remove the title 42 restrictions 
on entry, this crisis is about to get 
much, much worse. 
We have heard estimates of unau-
thorized border encounters this sum-
mer ranging close to 20,000 daily. We 
don’t know how to handle these num-
bers, and nothing has been done by the 
administration to deter these immi-
grants. Despite knowing of the coming 
influx and despite understanding the 
statutory mandates which would re-
quire immigrants to be detained, this 
administration is closing detention 
centers. It appears we now have fewer 
than 20,000 detention beds available. 
This seems to suggest that DHS has 
no intention of detaining these immi-
grants, even though it is plainly re-
quired by statute. In the midst of this 
unprecedented crisis at our southern 
border, the Department of Homeland 
Security, under Secretary Mayorkas, 
has, by regulation, bypassed duly en-
acted laws to make the asylum process 
a mere rubberstamp for basically any-
one who can make it to our border. Be-
cause of the internet and the sophis-
tication of coyotes and cartels, every 
alien encountered knows to express 
fear of returning to their home coun-
try, thus triggering the asylum proc-
ess. 
This rule would change that adver-
sarial process—whereby one actually 
has to produce some shred of evidence 
that they qualify for asylum to a non-
adversarial process—whereby the alien 
merely has to assert their claim. Addi-
tionally, this rule would take the asy-
lum decisions out of the hands of immi-
gration judges and put them into the 
hands of frontline screeners who often 
have no legal skills at all. 
This rule violates current immigra-
tion laws—laws passed by this body, 
laws enacted by Congress. It violates 
the separation of powers by usurping 
congressional authority to enact the 
laws of the Nation. Currently, under 
the law, until an immigration judge 
has ruled on an asylum claim, the 
claimant is required to be detained. 
Under the proposed rule, there would 
be no need for detention because no 
time would be required to rubberstamp 
that asylum application. It just hap-
pens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2718 
May 26, 2022 
It is very interesting that this rule is 
about to go into effect right before this 
already unprecedented crisis exponen-
tially increases. I don’t think this is by 
accident. It is by design. This rule dem-
onstrates that they simply want to 
manage the unprecedented influx of il-
legal immigrants into every American 
city, making every town a border town. 
America has always been a wel-
coming land, a land with outstretched 
arms. And it always should be. I am 
very proud of Utahns for how well they 
exemplify that welcoming spirit to im-
migrants, including the refugees and 
the asylum seekers who come into our 
State. I am also concerned that if we 
degrade the process by administrative 
rule, we erode our ability to give refuge 
and asylum in the cases where it is 
truly needed, in the cases where, as a 
representative body, we have decided it 
should be given. 
Now, in studying this rule, I was 
struck by the fact that it assumes asy-
lum is a right—a legal right—for any-
one and everyone managing somehow 
to get to our border. It is not a right. 
Asylum is a gift, a gift that the United 
States can choose to bestow on those 
who really need it: the persecuted, 
when authorized by law and consistent 
with the terms of the law. This rule 
doesn’t ever mention the interests of 
the American citizen in this process, 
not once—the interest that would usu-
ally be representative in the adjudica-
tive adversarial process that occurs be-
fore a judge. The American people are 
left out of this process. In fact, that 
process is eliminated by this rule. In-
deed, this rule is completely uncon-
cerned with the interests of the Amer-
ican people. It prioritizes the claimed 
interests of illegal immigrants over the 
interests of our own people and Amer-
ican national security. It must be 
struck down, and I encourage my col-
leagues to support it. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The majority whip. 
H.R. 350 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
morning we are going to consider H.R. 
350, which is legislation which I intro-
duced some time ago. I want to de-
scribe it because it has been inac-
curately described before and let Mem-
bers know what they are voting on. 
First, what does it relate to? Domes-
tic terrorism. Is that a Federal crime? 
You bet it is, and this particular bill 
makes reference to that crime. Hate 
crimes? It refers to that too. Is that a 
real crime? It is a Federal crime, and 
we refer to it specifically. 
So what new crimes are created in 
this bill? None. Not one. What we are 
doing is asking the Federal Agencies 
that have the responsibility of national 
security to give us timely reports on 
the incidence of domestic terrorism, 
and we say to them there are cat-
egories which the FBI has already es-
tablished of domestic terrorism. And 
those categories—I would like to spell 
out a couple of them to you so it is 
pretty clear what we are going after 
here: racially and ethnically motivated 
violent extremism; anti-government, 
anti-authority violent extremism; ani-
mal rights and environmental violent 
extremism; abortion-related violent ex-
tremism and others. 
So those are already categories of do-
mestic terrorism that the FBI reports 
on. What we are saying is, give us 
those reports in a timely fashion so we 
can see the incidence of these forms of 
extremism and the commission of 
crimes. 
But there is one correction that we 
are making that is very important. 
During 
the 
Trump 
administration, 
they eliminated reference in this list of 
categories of domestic terrorism of 
White supremacist activity. The reason 
why it is important for us to include 
that is that we have the sworn testi-
mony of the Director of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation that this is a 
category of crime and terrorism in 
America that is ‘‘metastasizing’’—his 
word, metastasizing. So we believe it is 
important that we be given informa-
tion about the incidence of violent ex-
tremism, domestic terrorism, that re-
lates to this type of activity, this 
White supremacy. 
I will tell you, it is not an imagined 
crime. We see the reality of it way too 
often. We just saw it 2 weeks ago in 
Buffalo, NY. That shooter put his so- 
called manifesto on the internet and 
declared, among other things, his sup-
port for the ‘‘great replacement the-
ory.’’ 
The ‘‘great replacement theory’’ is a 
thinly veiled White supremacist theory 
that tries to suggest that immigrants 
to America are somehow only arriving 
at the expense of those already here, 
particularly White Americans. That 
sort of theory has been out there since 
the days of the Ku Klux Klan, maybe 
even before it. But it is White suprem-
acy. It inspired this man to do terrible 
things in Buffalo and kill innocent peo-
ple at that grocery store. 
So we are asking the FBI to give us 
this information. We will draw conclu-
sions as we will, but that is basically 
it. No new crime is created nor is any 
new authority being created in the 
process. I think that is a critical ele-
ment. 
But there is one other thing that is 
part of this exercise this morning in 
voting for H.R. 350. The majority lead-
er, Senator SCHUMER, after the events 
in Uvalde, TX, declared that we are 
going to try to reach out, on a bipar-
tisan basis, to come up with legislation 
to deal with gun safety and safety in 
schools. His first effort to do this is 
this bill. 
What we are voting on is a motion to 
proceed to the bill. He has invited col-
leagues, on a bipartisan basis, to come 
forward and to offer their amendments 
in the field of gun safety and school 
safety. That is why this motion to pro-
ceed is more than just the bill I de-
scribed. It is an opportunity for amend-
ments on the floor. 
This morning, I had an interview 
with CNN, and they talked about the 
fact that we are leaving for a week for 
Memorial Day to honor our veterans 
and be home and then return. Why 
aren’t we staying and working? Well, 
here is the chance for us to make it 
clear that we are going to work on 
what happened in these terrible trage-
dies in Uvalde, TX, and Buffalo, NY, 
and so many others. 
So I am appealing to my colleagues 
on the Republican side of the aisle, if 
you have any ideas, and I hope you do, 
for gun safety, school safety, and to 
make this a safer nation, this is the ve-
hicle to do it. A ‘‘yes’’ vote on the mo-
tion to proceed to H.R. 350 is your op-
portunity to open a process where we 
can consider amendments. 
Senator SCHUMER was very explicit. 
He invited Democrats as well as Repub-
licans to come forward with their best 
ideas on a bipartisan basis. And isn’t 
that what the people of the country are 
actually asking for, more than any-
thing; that we roll up our sleeves and 
face this challenge which has taken so 
many innocent lives? 
In the newspaper yesterday, in the 
New York Times, they did a feature on 
those wonderful little kids and the 
teachers who lost their lives in Uvalde, 
TX. It is heartbreaking to see those 
kids, those beautiful little children, 
and to realize that they are no longer 
with us and that their families are 
grieving in a way they never imagined 
they would. 
Isn’t it up to us to do something 
about it rather than just give press re-
leases? Isn’t it up to us as legislators 
to legislate and try to find solutions? 
This opportunity, the motion to pro-
ceed, opens the door to that possibility. 
We can return the week after Memo-
rial Day recess and start in earnest 
considering amendments offered by 
Democrats and Republicans which deal 
with this issue. We owe the American 
people that. We are elected to this job 
to legislate, not just to give speeches 
but to change the laws in this country 
to make it safer. This is our chance to 
do it. I urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, vote for H.R. 350. 
This is an important bill in and of 
itself, but equally important is the fact 
that it opens a process Americans are 
longing to hear that we take seriously. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
motion to proceed on H.R. 350. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for up to 10 minutes, followed by 
Senator JOHNSON for 10 minutes, prior 
to the scheduled rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today 
was supposed to be the last day of 
school in Uvalde, TX. Each of us can 
remember how excited we were as chil-
dren, as students, but especially we can 
remember being a parent the last day 
of school our child attended. Your child

would perhaps run into your arms and 
recount a fun-filled day with their 
classmates. They would sling their 
backpack on the backseat of the car 
and talk about how excited they were 
about the summer, to spend days play-
ing with their friends and their sib-
lings, swimming at the local pool with 
friends, and maybe even going on a va-
cation with their grandparents. 
Today, those children, those parents, 
and those teachers in Uvalde, TX, have 
been robbed of the excitement and nor-
malcy that this day would normally 
bring. Instead of celebrating the last 
day of school, 21 families are making 
funeral arrangements. 
Earlier this week, a monster vi-
ciously murdered innocent children 
and their teachers at Robb Elementary 
School. So far we know that 21 people 
have been killed by the shooter, includ-
ing 19 students and 2 teachers. This 
tragedy has absolutely shattered the 
tight-knit community of Uvalde, TX. 
Uvalde is a town of about 15,000 peo-
ple, about 65 miles from the United 
States-Mexican border. There is one 
high school football team, one H-E-B 
Grocery store, and one post office. The 
families of Uvalde have known each 
other and loved each other’s children 
for as long as they can remember. 
The grief caused by this attack is 
shared by the entire community, and I 
join all Texans in lifting up the vic-
tims, their families, and those who are 
struggling to make sense of this trag-
edy. 
Yesterday, I was in Uvalde with my 
fellow Texans in mourning. I joined 
hundreds of people in donating blood 
and received an update from law en-
forcement and both State and commu-
nity leaders. As though we needed a re-
minder of the tight-knit community, a 
deputy sheriff himself lost his own 
daughter in this attack, and two mem-
bers of the mayor’s staff lost children 
as well. 
One of the conversations I had that 
really struck home was with an older 
gentleman who responded to the call 
for blood donations at the Herby Ham 
Activity Center. As we waited our turn 
to donate blood, he shared with me 
that he had lost two grandchildren in 
the shooting. It is not possible for us to 
comprehend the pain he must be feel-
ing, but there he was, donating blood. 
Two young lives were stolen from his 
family, and, still, this man stood in 
line so he could support his community 
in some tangible way. 
During the briefing from law enforce-
ment, two of the Uvalde police officers 
who responded to the shooting shared 
their harrowing experiences with us, 
and in the face of such unthinkable 
evil, their courage was unwavering. 
One of these Uvalde police officers re-
sponded to the scene, and I had a 
chance to thank him personally. 
I want to thank all of the law en-
forcement 
officials, 
the 
emergency 
medical technicians, and healthcare 
workers who responded to this tragedy 
and who continue to support the sur-
vivors and their loved ones. 
At times like this, I am reminded of 
a quote I heard some time ago from a 
county commissioner in the face of a 
similar tragedy. He said: 
Being a Texan doesn’t describe where you 
are from as much as it describes who your 
family is. 
Today, our entire family is mourn-
ing. Our hearts are broken by those 
who lost loved ones and the survivors 
who will never forget this terrifying 
and senseless attack. 
While the terror of this attack will 
weigh on all of us, we saw the spirit of 
my State on full display as resources 
poured out to help the loved ones of the 
community who were hurting so badly. 
From mental health counseling to food 
donations, there was an outflow of sup-
port from the South Texas community. 
At times like this, words seem so in-
adequate. There is no good way to com-
pletely express the heartbreak and 
anger that swell in your chest at a mo-
ment like this. All we can say, perhaps, 
is that our condolences are with the 
families who are grieving such a cruel 
and unexpected loss. I can’t fathom the 
pain of seeing an empty bed where your 
child slept the night before. 
Knowing we can’t turn back the 
clock to prevent this tragedy from oc-
curring, the obvious question then is, 
How do we prevent something like this 
from happening again? 
At this point, law enforcement is 
still investigating and piecing together 
the full story. In the coming days, I ex-
pect we will have better information 
about the shooter and his background 
and the circumstances that led to this 
senseless, brutal act. Once it does, I am 
eager to see whether there were any 
gaps that might have done something 
to make this attack less likely, that 
might have actually even prevented 
this attack from taking place. 
In the past, I have worked with col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
prevent senseless tragedies from occur-
ring, through things like Fix NICS and 
the Mental Health and Safe Commu-
nities Act. Fix NICS, you will recall, 
occurred after the Sutherland Springs 
shooting, where the shooter’s criminal 
convictions were not uploaded by the 
Air Force into the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System, 
so he was able to go to a local sporting 
goods store and buy weapons—by lying 
and buying. I am convinced that in 
working with Senator MURPHY and all 
of our colleagues, we were able to get 
70 or more cosponsors on that bill be-
cause it actually addressed a real gap 
in the system, and it would actually 
give us some hope that we would actu-
ally save lives in the future. 
I am not interested in making a po-
litical statement. I am not interested 
in the same old tired talking points. I 
am actually interested in what we can 
do to make the terrible events that oc-
curred in Uvalde less likely in the fu-
ture. We don’t know everything we 
need to know, but once we do, I expect 
there will be an informed debate about 
the reforms we can make, and I look 
forward to participating in those dis-
cussions. 
For now, the focus should remain on 
supporting the people of this little 
community, who suffered an immeas-
urable loss this week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, let me 
first also express my condolences and 
associate myself with the comments of 
the Senator from Texas. The tragedy is 
horrific. It is hard to think of anything 
more awful than what happened in 
Texas and in other schools over the 
last few years. 
ASYLUM RULE 
Mr. President, I come to the floor 
today for another reason—in support of 
using the Congressional Review Act to 
disapprove of and prevent the imple-
mentation of a rule titled Procedures 
for Credible Fear Screening and Con-
sideration of Asylum, Withholding of 
Removal, and CAT Protection Claims 
by Asylum Officers. I will refer to this 
rule as the ‘‘asylum rule’’ to make it a 
little bit simpler. As the title suggests, 
there is an awful lot to this, but the 
reason we ought to disapprove of it is 
actually quite simple. 
This rule will go into effect at the 
end of this month, on May 31. On May 
31, what this new rule will do is it will 
allow the USCIS, asylum officers, to 
begin granting asylum without review 
by an immigration court. 
It is important to note that section 
240 of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act, 
which 
governs 
removal 
pro-
ceedings, states: 
[a]n immigration judge shall conduct pro-
ceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or 
deportability of an alien. 
Now, an immigration court is an ad-
judicative court. It is a separate unit of 
government from a USCIS officer, who 
is within the Department of Homeland 
Security in the executive branch. It is 
a check and balance on executive ac-
tion. It is a very necessary check and 
balance on an executive who is not 
faithfully executing the laws, as we 
have today with President Biden and 
Secretary Mayorkas. 
On May 1 of this year, news reporter 
Bret Baier asked Secretary Mayorkas 
in an interview: 
Is it the objective of the Biden administra-
tion to sharply reduce the total number of il-
legal immigrants coming across the southern 
border? 
The obvious answer to Bret Baier’s 
question is, That is the goal—to reduce 
the flow of people coming into this 
country illegally. 
That ought to be every administra-
tion’s goal. That is what a President 
and an administration would do if they 
were faithfully executing the laws; but 
listen to Secretary Mayorkas’s reply, 
his answer. 
Secretary Mayorkas stated: ‘‘It is the 
objective of the Biden administration 
to make sure that we have safe, or-
derly, and legal pathways for individ-
uals to be able to access our legal sys-
tem.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2720 
May 26, 2022 
I first must note that our legal sys-
tem is horribly broken. It is that legal 
system that has produced this result. 
Now, I don’t expect the viewers to look 
at and to be able to see everything on 
this chart, but you can go to my 
website and download this, and you 
will see the cause and effect of various 
directives, of various rules, of various 
regulations, and of various court orders 
and proceedings to cause this explo-
sion—this out-of-control flow—of ille-
gal immigration. 
By the way, it all started back in 2009 
when then-ICE Director Morton issued 
a directive directly contravening the 
plain language of the law that required 
detaining individuals whose asylum 
claim was being adjudicated. So we 
stopped detaining them. 
Then, of course, in June 2012, Presi-
dent Obama, through his DHS Sec-
retary, 
created 
the 
DACA 
memo-
randum, which was an open invitation 
to unaccompanied children coming to 
this country because they knew that, 
once they got here, they would be able 
to stay. 
If you take a look at the history 
here, the gold represents single adults 
coming into this country illegally and 
being apprehended. This is on a month-
ly basis. Blue is family units exploiting 
our very broken asylum system, where 
the credible fear standard gives you a 
free pass into the country. Red rep-
resents unaccompanied children. 
It is important to note that back in 
2014, when President Obama declared it 
a humanitarian crisis, about 2,000 peo-
ple were being apprehended at the bor-
der on a daily basis—2,000. Now, again, 
because of different policy choices, the 
word gets out—and because of different 
court decisions—and people in Central 
America and throughout the world re-
alize that we are not following our asy-
lum laws. We have a virtually open 
border. We are engaging in ‘‘catch and 
release.’’ 
So President Trump had to deal with 
a surge in 2019 of more than 4,000 peo-
ple per day in a given month, and you 
can see that surge here. But President 
Trump took action. He engaged. He im-
plemented the Return to Mexico pol-
icy. He made agreements with the Cen-
tral American countries and Mexico, 
and we pretty well stopped the flow of 
unaccompanied children and family 
units. We actually reduced the flow of 
single adults who were exploiting our 
broken immigration system. 
Then, during the Presidential de-
bates, Democratic candidates, includ-
ing President Biden, declared to the 
world that they weren’t going to deport 
people; they were going to offer people 
who were coming into this country ille-
gally free healthcare. 
You can see, even during 2020, as we 
were building the walls—and we had 
the Return to Mexico policy in place— 
that single adults realized there might 
be a change in policy, and they started 
flooding our border. If you will notice, 
we went from, on average over about 10 
years, about 30,000 single adults per 
month coming into this country to the 
last 2 months, when it has been over 
150,000 or closer to 160,000, 170,000 single 
adults. Throw on top of that, at almost 
the minute that President Biden came 
into office and dismantled those suc-
cessful programs, we then had a new 
flood, a new surge, of family units in 
blue 
and 
unaccompanied 
children 
flooding our border and exploiting our 
asylum laws. 
This new rule that is about to take 
effect at the end of this month, the 
asylum rule, again, circumvents, is 
contrary to stated law that says immi-
gration judges, immigration courts, 
need to make that asylum determina-
tion, not members of the administra-
tion, not USCIS officers. 
What this rule does is it gives that 
power to grant asylum—an awesome 
power that Congress never meant to 
give to the administration—to USCIS 
officers and only allows a judge to take 
a look at it if the asylum claim is de-
nied by the USCIS officer. This isn’t 
going to do anything to reduce the 
backlog. What this will do is this in-
crease the flow. This is another signal 
throughout the world that we have an 
open border policy. 
The only restraint right now is title 
42, and this administration is working 
actively to overturn a court order that 
says you must keep title 42 restrictions 
in place. And if the USCIS officer isn’t 
as generous as we fear they all will be 
and actually denies asylum, you are 
right 
back 
there 
in 
immigration 
courts. So the only purpose of this rule 
is to increase the flow, to accomplish 
Secretary Mayorkas’s stated goal of 
making sure we have a safe, orderly, 
and legal pathway for individuals to 
access our legal system. In other 
words, this administration’s policy on 
the border isn’t to secure it, isn’t to re-
duce the flow; it is to make the proc-
essing and dispersing of illegal immi-
grants more efficient so more will 
come. 
Last year, one and a quarter million 
people either encountered and dis-
persed or came in as known ‘‘got- 
aways,’’ came to this country illegally 
and were dispersed. That is a number 
that is larger than the population of 
eight States. That is how out of con-
trol 
this 
crisis 
is. 
Yet 
Secretary 
Mayorkas won’t even call it a problem, 
much less a crisis. 
So it is obvious how harmful this 
rule is to our Nation and to our na-
tional security. An open border is a na-
tional security threat. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
using the Congressional Review Act to 
disapprove of this rule and prevent its 
implementation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
H.R. 350 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
speak today on the Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act. 
As I have said many times, I am com-
mitted to fighting political violence 
from across the political spectrum. 
This bill doesn’t help us do that. 
In fact, career DOJ attorneys review-
ing the legislation have indicated that 
the bill is ‘‘harmful’’ and ‘‘counter-
productive.’’ I use their words. 
This short bill merely reorganizes 
the government offices that already 
fight domestic terrorism in DHS, DOJ, 
and 
the 
FBI. 
This 
reorganization 
wasn’t sought by the Agencies them-
selves. 
In fact, in technical assistance pro-
vided to us, the operators pointed out a 
number of problems with it. For exam-
ple, the bill assigns responsibilities 
monitoring and analyzing domestic 
terrorism activity to DHS that actu-
ally belong in FBI. 
The other major feature of the legis-
lation is a direction to the Agencies 
that they must focus on the greatest 
historical threats, looking backward. 
The operators have told us this 
means they can’t be agile or address 
rapidly evolving threats if they were to 
follow this law. 
I am always willing to listen to the 
needs of Agencies that keep Americans 
safe. 
In fact, there are authorities that 
DOJ and the FBI need, for inter-
national terrorism. 
I introduced an amendment to the 
NDAA last year, to expand these au-
thorities. I hope we will pass it into 
law this year. 
The domestic and international func-
tions work together, and siloing them 
would not help DOJ fight terrorism. 
The Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act won’t help us prevent or combat 
terrorism. Therefore, I urge my col-
leagues to vote no on moving to this 
bill. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am proud to support and cosponsor S. 
4255, the Domestic Terrorism Preven-
tion Act of 2022, which the Senate is 
considering as H.R. 350. This bill is 
critically important in supporting law 
enforcement’s response to domestic 
terrorism. 
Domestic terrorism has become in-
creasingly common. According to a re-
cent study by the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies, more than 
two-thirds of domestic terrorist plots 
and attacks in 2020 were fueled by 
White supremacists and ideologically 
aligned violent extremists. 
Unfortunately, just last week in Buf-
falo, NY, we saw the savage destruc-
tion that hate can cause. A gunman 
killed 10 people and injured 3 others in 
a local grocery store. Eleven of the 13 
people who were shot were Black. Make 
no mistake, this act of violence was a 
domestic terrorism incident. 
We must do more to stop these hei-
nous acts of violence. To do this, we 
must provide our law enforcement with 
the resources they need. This bill will 
would help establish offices within the 
Department of Homeland Security, the 
Department of Justice, and the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation that would 
monitor, investigate, and prosecute do-
mestic terrorism crimes. This bill 
would also help ensure that all law en-
forcement agencies have access to anti- 
terrorism resources.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2721 
May 26, 2022 
I believe this bill is an important 
step to help address the rising threat of 
domestic 
terrorism 
throughout 
the 
country. 
I am proud to cosponsor this bipar-
tisan bill, and I am happy to see my 
Democratic colleagues support it on 
the floor today. 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, today, I 
will vote to open debate on H.R. 350, 
the Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act. 
Should the Senate so proceed, how-
ever, I will insist on a thorough and ju-
dicious debate and on a process that 
empowers Senators to offer and vote on 
amendments. 
Before I determine whether to sup-
port passage of this legislation, I will 
weigh that debate, I will consider ex-
pert analysis and input from executive 
agencies, and I will assess the merits 
and effects of amendments that may be 
considered and adopted. 
This legislative process must ensure 
that Federal law enforcement is trans-
parent, accountable, and apolitical. 
The threat of domestic terrorism is 
real. The United States must continue 
to confront it. We have sworn an oath 
to defend the Constitution from all en-
emies foreign and domestic. We must 
do so in a manner informed by objec-
tive threat assessments, consistent 
with our Constitution, and attentive to 
civil liberties. 
Any time we establish or codify Fed-
eral law enforcement offices tasked 
with 
investigating 
and 
prosecuting 
crimes committed by Americans or col-
lecting and analyzing intelligence re-
lated to American citizens, we must 
ensure safeguards are sufficiently ro-
bust to protect civil rights and civil 
liberties. Consideration of such legisla-
tion may present us with an oppor-
tunity to assess what Congress got 
right and what Congress got wrong in 
the aftermath of 9/11, when the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security was estab-
lished and Federal counterterrorism ef-
forts and authorities grew consider-
ably, and to calibrate policy accord-
ingly. 
In short, I vote today to open debate, 
but I do not yet commit to voting for 
passage of this legislation while the 
process of review, debate, and potential 
amendment continues. 
CLOTURE MOTION

MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
enter a motion to reconsider the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is entered. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am 
rising to ask unanimous consent to 
consider the nomination of Leopoldo 
Martinez. This body should confirm 
him today to serve as Executive Direc-
tor of the Inter-American Development 
Bank. 
From the world’s highest per capita 
COVID infection and death rates to the 
largest economic contraction anywhere 
in the world, Latin America and the 
Caribbean are still struggling to re-
cover from devastating waves of the 
pandemic. 
The region also faces historic refugee 
and migration movements that stretch 
across the continent. And added to 
this, many of these nations must con-
front longstanding poverty and in-
equality as well as climate change and 
threats to the environment. 
Given the significant economic social 
and development challenges in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, we ur-
gently need Senate-confirmed leader-
ship at our hemisphere’s most impor-
tant multilateral development bank. 
The Inter-American Development Bank 
is essential to addressing these issues. 
It is critical that we have strong U.S. 
leadership at the Bank. Mr. Martinez 
brings decades of experience in the 
public and private sector, as well as 
academia, and he will provide exactly 
that. 
He has advised Fortune 500 compa-
nies and private equity funds. He has 
helped international business and non-
governmental organizations, and he 
has committed to work with the Sen-
ate to support a much needed capital 
increase for the Bank, which we ap-
proved as part of the U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act last year. 
This nomination has been pending for 
9 months—9 months. It is time for the 
Senate to act, especially when we have 
China—and I know my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have spent a 
lot of time talking about China and 
whether we were strong enough in 
meeting the China threat. Well, China 
is all over the Western Hemisphere 
making huge investments. 
I talked to one foreign leader this 
past week from the hemisphere. He 
said to me: Listen, what is the United 
States offering? Because I am being of-
fered $800 million, 1 percent, over 30 
years. I am not taking it, but at some 
point, we need to have engagement in 
the hemisphere economically. 
That is what the Inter-American De-
velopment Bank can do without cost-
ing U.S. taxpayers money. But for 
that, you need leadership that is fo-
cused on getting the IDB to build the 
partnerships and the programs that 
can help us have a presence to counter 
China in the first place and also to pro-
mote prosperity, security, and sta-
bility. 
And for all of those of my colleagues 
who are concerned about the southern 
border, well, let’s get an organization 
that can help create greater prosperity 
and stability in the hemisphere so peo-
ple won’t be fleeing from the cir-
cumstances. 
I don’t understand why this has 
taken 9 months, but that is what draws 
me to come to the floor. So I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee be discharged 
and the Senate proceed to the fol-
lowing nomination: PN1028, Leopoldo 
Martinez Nucete, to be United States 
Executive Director of the Inter-Amer-
ican Development Bank for a term of 
three years, vice Eliot Pedrosa; that 
the Senate vote on the nomination 
with no intervening action or debate; 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table; 
that no further motions be made in 
order to the nomination; and that any 
related statements be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. This nominee re-
ceived a tie vote in the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, meaning that he 
failed to be reported favorably to the 
floor. This tie vote indicates that the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Republicans have significant concerns 
with this nominee; therefore, he should 
be discharged per the process laid out 
in the Senate power-sharing agreement 
for this Congress, not passed by unani-
mous consent. Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am 
going to be honest here. This isn’t real-
ly about Mr. Martinez, his experience, 
his views. It is just another thinly 
veiled attempt to block another of the 
President’s nominees and to do so at a 
time in which China is eating our 
lunch. 
So the next time one of my col-
leagues gets up and talks about China, 
I am going to remind them of the posi-
tion that they have taken to block one 
of the critical nominees who could help 
us meet that challenge in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
Mr. President, let me turn to another 
nominee who has been pending before 
the Senate, who did pass the com-
mittee, by the way, favorably—not on 
a tie vote but favorably. I am going to, 
in a moment, ask unanimous consent 
to confirm Dr. Monde Muyangwa to 
serve as Assistant Administrator for 
USAID’s Africa Bureau. This body 
should confirm her without delay. 
The promotion of democracy, a key 
goal for USAID, is threatened through-
out Africa. In just the past 2 years, 
there have been coups in Sudan, Chad, 
Guinea, Burkina Faso, and two in Mali. 
Authoritarians across Africa have 
new tactics to subvert democratic 
movements. They have modern tools to 
silence dissenting voices. They deploy 
disinformation campaigns and sophisti-
cated surveillance technology coming 
from China to stay in power. And from 
Mali to the Central African Republic, 
dictators are turning to Russian mer-
cenaries for support. 
Democracy advocates, human rights 
offenders, and civil society leaders 
across the continent are courageously 
working to realize their aspirations 
and goals. They need a reliable partner 
at USAID to keep the struggle for de-
mocracy in their countries, and that is 
why we have to advance this nominee 
today. 
Dr. Muyangwa is eminently qualified 
to lead USAID’s Africa Bureau. She 
brings extensive professional and aca-
demic experience in Africa. She is a 
Zambian-born immigrant to the United 
States, where she has held senior posi-
tions at the Wilson Center, the Africa 
Center for Strategic Studies, and the 
National Summit on Africa. She was a 
Rhodes Scholar, a Wingate Scholar for 
her scholarship at Oxford, the valedic-
torian for her graduating class at the 
University of Zambia, and she holds a 
doctorate in international relations 
from the University of Oxford. Do you 
think she is well qualified? In short, 
her qualifications are exceptional. 
Finally, let me say that while Africa 
faces many challenges, it is also a land 
of tremendous opportunity. But here, 
again, China is all over Africa in pre-
cious minerals and other precious ma-
terials, in subverting nascent democ-
racies by their debt-trap diplomacy. 
And where are we? Absent, because we 
don’t even have somebody who can 
focus on the hemisphere—a hemisphere 
that we should have gotten a lot more 
votes at the United Nations when we 
were pursuing the sanctions against 
Russia. But guess what. We don’t have 
anybody talking to these countries. So 
I see no reason, with somebody with

such a stellar background, to ulti-
mately be objected to. 
So I will I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate consider the following 
nomination: Calendar No. 815, Monde 
Muyangwa, to be an Assistant Admin-
istrator of the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development; that the Senate 
vote on the nomination without inter-
vening action or debate; that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table; and that any 
statements related to the nomination 
be printed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Reserving the right 
to object, USAID awarded a $200 mil-
lion grant for a 10-year viral emergence 
early warning project known as PRE-
DICT. 
We have uncovered evidence of pos-
sible embezzlement, possible money 
laundering, and insider threats, as well 
as other concerns related to the PRE-
DICT and other USAID grant awards. 
PREDICT was led by a consortium 
spearheaded 
by 
UC 
Davis 
and 
EcoHealth Alliance, which funneled 
taxpayer dollars to the Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology to conduct risky re-
search on potential pandemic patho-
gens, including bat coronavirus re-
search. 
USAID and NIH both awarded multi-
million dollar grants to EcoHealth Al-
liance during the same 5-year period 
leading up to and immediately pre-
ceding the COVID–19 outbreak. 
EcoHealth is unable to produce to 
NIH proof of its research, such as lab 
notebooks and virus samples, so we are 
simply asking USAID for proof of the 
EcoHealth research they funded. We re-
quested records from USAID that grant 
recipients are legally required to main-
tain. Our requests are, indeed, fact- 
based. 
At this point, we believe either the 
USAID staff is withholding the records 
from Congress or they have failed to 
access them through the UC Davis and 
EcoHealth Alliance. Either option is 
unacceptable. As such, I object to the 
unanimous consent motion but look 
forward to working with the chairman 
to address these issues. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
through the Chair, would my colleague 
say that—have you not been provided 
three rounds of documents that have 
been requested? 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Unfortunately, the 
documents were not what we asked for. 
They are incomplete. They don’t give 
us what we are looking for. But we 
would welcome the opportunity to sit 
down with the chairman and try to ad-
dress— 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Through the Pre-
siding Officer, has my colleague not 
been offered a briefing by USAID to try 
to answer the rest of his questions? 
This is an extraordinary amount of 
information being offered for someone 
who is not even a member of the For-
eign Relations Committee. But, none-
theless, in order to accommodate him, 
we want to get to a point that he feels 
comfortable to do so. Have you not 
been offered a briefing, which you have 
not yet accepted? 
Mr. MARSHALL. Not that I am 
aware of. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, my under-
standing is that there has been, Mr. 
President, an offer of a briefing made 
to the Senator. 
And, by the way, this has nothing to 
do with Dr. Muyangwa. She has noth-
ing to do with any of this. She is nomi-
nated to be the Assistant Adminis-
trator for Africa, nothing to do with 
China, nothing to do with Wuhan, 
nothing to do with anything else. 
I would urge my colleague, if you 
have all this information about illicit 
activities, please bring it forward. The 
committee would like to consider it. 
But I haven’t seen any of it. It is time 
to put up or shut up. 
I yield the floor.

ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
begin, I want to express my sorrow at 
the terrible shooting in Texas on Tues-
day that claimed the lives of 2 teachers 
and 19 schoolchildren. 
Like a lot of Americans, I cannot 
imagine the anguish these children’s 
parents are facing right now as they 
grieve for sons and daughters whom 
they will never again drive to school or 
welcome home at the end of the day. 
I pray that the Lord will be with 
them in their suffering and that they 
will receive the comfort and strength 
that they need. 
My prayers are with the entire 
Uvalde community—the families of 
those killed, the injured, the teachers, 
and students who suffered such terror, 
the medical and law enforcement per-
sonnel who responded, and all those 
reeling from this terrible attack. 
SOUTH DAKOTA 
Mr. President, this past weekend, I 
headed to Murdo, SD, the small town of 
around 500 people where I grew up. 
Needless to say, any trip to Murdo 
brings back a lot of memories. First 
and foremost are those memories of my 
parents Pat and Harold Thune and of 
growing up with my three brothers and 
sister. 
We were lucky kids to have my par-
ents. My mom was a wonderful, loving, 
eternally optimistic mother who spent 
most of my growing up years as our 
school librarian. She was responsible 
for making sure that we Thune kids 
got some culture, whether we wanted it 
or not. She was the one who made sure 
we got an introduction to music and 
learned how to play the piano. With 
her encouragement, I even joined the 
swing choir—although I will spare you, 
Mr. President, from any recitals. 
In the summer, she would make us 
come inside for an hour every day to 
read. I didn’t always want to come in-
side on those beautiful summer days. 
At the time, I would have much pre-
ferred to keep shooting hoops with the 
basket my dad had attached to a pole 
in our backyard. But today I am grate-
ful for every minute that she made us 
spend with books. 
My dad, he was our hero—a division I 
basketball player, a World War II com-
bat pilot. He was a teacher at my high 
school. And a coach. And the athletic 
director. Oh, and also the bus driver. 
So between him and my mom as the 
librarian, we Thune kids were prac-
tically never away from our parents’ 
watchful eyes. I am so grateful to have 
had my dad’s coaching in sports and in 
life. My dad taught us, as players, to 
play as a team. He didn’t like ball hogs 
or people who were in the game for the 
personal glory. He believed your job as 
a member of a team was to make the 
people around you better. If somebody 
else was in a better position to take 
the shot, you always made the extra 
pass. You didn’t try to pad your own 
statistics. You played for the good of 
the team. 
It is an attitude I have tried to carry 
with me throughout my life. My par-
ents gave us Thune kids a strong set of 
values and an inheritance of faith. In 
good times and bad, faith was their an-
chor and the Holy Scriptures, their 
roadmap. And I am grateful that they 
taught us who to turn to in times of 
trouble. 
Mr. President, being in Murdo re-
minded me of my parents, as it always 
does. It also made me reflect on just 
how lucky I was to grow up in a small 
town—and small-town South Dakota in 
particular. It is true that growing up in 
a small town meant that my parents 
had heard all about any of the Thune 
kids’ misdemeanors before we even 
made it home. 
But even with that little drawback, 
small-town 
life 
was 
wonderful. 
In 
Murdo, you know everyone, and every-
one knows you. And that gave us a 
sense of community and belonging that 
we carry to this day. Growing up in 
Murdo also taught us just how much 
we are all connected. 
Mr. President, South Dakotans are 
independent people, but we also rely on

our neighbors when the going gets 
tough. And the going can get tough. 
But, in Murdo, we knew that if a roof 
collapsed under the weight of snow or a 
windstorm came through and wiped out 
a barn or we lost a friend or family 
member, the whole community would 
rally around to help. 
Small-town life has a beautiful sim-
plicity. On summer nights, my dad 
would take us to get ice cream cones, 
and then we would drive down to the 
White River. We would roll down the 
windows and feel the breeze and watch 
the sun drop below the horizon—no 
staring at iPhones or checking likes on 
social media. 
Those were idyllic evenings. Mo-
ments like those kept us connected to 
what really mattered: our family, our 
community, the land. Mr. President, 
the values I saw reflected growing up 
in Murdo are reflected in towns all 
across our State. In Murdo, I learned 
the character of South Dakotans, the 
work ethic, the commitment to free-
dom coupled with the belief in personal 
responsibility and the sense of respon-
sibility to the broader community. 
Agriculture, of course, is the life-
blood of South Dakota, and it is a hard 
way of life. It is backbreaking work in 
all weathers, always with the risk that 
all your work can be wiped out in mo-
ments by a storm. 
Anyone who grows up on a farm or 
ranch knows that everybody has to pull 
their weight or the farm or ranch just 
don’t survive. And I think that ground-
ing in agriculture has helped give 
South Dakotans their reputation for 
having a strong work ethic and a com-
mitment to getting the job done. 
And I am not kidding about that rep-
utation. As a Senator, I have traveled 
to a number of places around the 
world, and I regularly meet people— 
often 
military 
members—who 
talk 
about the work ethic of the South Da-
kotans they know. I am pretty sure it 
is that work ethic and sense of per-
sonal responsibility that is responsible 
for the fact that South Dakota has al-
ways punched above its weight when it 
comes to military service, as well as 
the 
patriotism 
that 
runs 
strongly 
through the South Dakota character. 
South Dakotans cherish their free-
doms, and they also believe that with 
freedom comes responsibility. And they 
have 
a 
deep 
appreciation for the 
Founders’ vision that has allowed us to 
enjoy such freedom and for the sac-
rifices that have been required to se-
cure it. With that comes an expecta-
tion that each generation has to do its 
part to pay freedom’s price and protect 
all that we have been given. 
The South Dakota values I learned 
growing up helped shape my political 
philosophy: my belief that government 
should be limited and that it is best 
when it is closest to the people; and 
that if a matter can be handled at the 
State or local level, it should be; that 
the legacy of the past is something to 
be cherished and preserved while leav-
ing, at the same time, room for change 
and adaptation when needed; that free-
dom is a sacred gift, one that must be 
defended, and that with freedom comes 
responsibility; and, finally, that while 
government is necessary, government 
is not where we should look for salva-
tion. 
Mr. President, the legacy of growing 
up in South Dakota is a precious one. 
We didn’t have much money, but we 
were very rich in the things that 
mattered. And I am deeply grateful for 
those years in Murdo, for the teachers 
and coaches and others in the commu-
nity who invested in me, and for every-
one who continues to make it feel like 
home and for the privilege of living in 
the Mount Rushmore State. 
It is my very great honor to rep-
resent the people of South Dakota in 
the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, most 
of my people in Louisiana, I think, are 
probably much like your people in 
Maine. Most of my people—most of our 
people—they just get up every day and 
go to work. They obey the law. They 
pay their taxes. They try to do the 
right thing by their kids, try to teach 
their kids morals. And they try to save 
a little money for retirement as they 
enjoy living in what they believe is the 
greatest country in all of human his-
tory. But many of my people, Mr. 
President, are struggling. 
President Biden took office on Janu-
ary 20 of last year. So—what are we?— 
we are in day 490 of Build Back Better. 
From where many of my people sit, 
nothing has been built and nothing is 
back and nothing is better. There is 
not a more appropriate example of that 
than the cost of living, inflation. 
When President Biden took office, 
the cost of gasoline in my State was 
$2—$2 a gallon. It is between $4.15 and 
$4.25 right now. And it is not just gaso-
line, Mr. President. I mean, I don’t 
need to tell you. A dozen eggs now 
costs $2.52. Ground beef is $5.41. A 
pound of chicken is $4.10. 
The price of oil, the price of gasoline 
affects so much in terms of our econ-
omy. I mean, most of our food and our 
clothes and our plastics, the things we 
use every day, are delivered by air, by 
van, by tanker, all of which use gaso-
line. Pharmaceuticals are affected by 
the price of oil. 
I don’t think it is any secret that the 
Biden administration is trying to dis-
rupt the production of oil in America. 
I think that is just a fact. We see it in 
the President canceling leases on Fed-
eral lands in the Gulf of Mexico, in 
ANWR. We see it from the difficult reg-
ulatory environment for oil and gas 
producers. 
The President has just promulgated 
new rules for the National Environ-
mental Policy Act. If those new rules 
come to fruition, it will be impossible 
to open a new pipeline in America, and 
I think we have to be honest about 
that. 
Now, to be fair, the Biden adminis-
tration is trying to disrupt the produc-
tion of oil and gas, especially oil, for 
environmental reasons, of which we are 
both aware. But, instead, the Biden ad-
ministration—this seems curious to 
me—wants us to buy oil from foreign 
countries. And those foreign countries 
deliver their oil in tankers that use 
2,000 gallons of fuel an hour and emit 8 
tons of carbon dioxide into the environ-
ment per hour. The irony of this is 
rich. 
Inflation and oil—once again, I think 
so much of our inflation in all of the 
products that we need to maintain our 
standard of living today starts with the 
price of oil. Now, President Biden has 
said he has no control over the price of 
oil and, therefore, the price of gasoline. 
But, Mr. President, you can’t have reg-
ulatory control over the drilling, the 
transporting, the storage, the refining, 
the trading, and the taxation of oil as 
the President does and say you have no 
control over the price of the com-
modity. I mean, that is just not true. 
Here is what most people in my State 
see, Mr. President. The President, in 
March of last year, sent every Amer-
ican a $1,400 stimulus check. And they 
were grateful, but then the Biden ad-
ministration, 
for 
its 
next 
trick, 
crashed their 401(k)s, increased their 
food bills by as much—for some as 
much as $3,000 a year; increased their 
rent, for many as much as $2,000 a year; 
and increased their gas bills for many 
as much as $1,000 a year. 
And they don’t see that as a good 
trade, Mr. President. And it is all de-
rived from President Biden’s energy 
policy, which is—here is his energy pol-
icy: wind, solar, and wishful thinking. 
It is just not realistic. And among 
other things, it is hurting our country. 
It is hurting my people in Louisiana 
desperately because of the rise in gaso-
line prices. 
I was very disappointed to see this 
week that the President has changed 
his approach to inflation and the price 
of gasoline. He has said we are now in 
a transition period, and he said it as if 
that were a positive thing. He said we 
are on a transition, and when we get 
through this transition, we are going 
to be stronger than ever because we are 
not going to have to rely on fossil 
fuels. 
And I am thinking, you know, I re-
spect the President; but honestly, what 
planet did he parachute in from? 
I 
had 
just 
finished 
reading 
JPMorgan’s 
energy 
report; 
and 
JPMorgan, looking out until 2030—not 
2050, 2030—just 8 years from now—said, 
in 2030, at the rate we are going, the 
demand for energy in America will be 
20 percent greater than the supply. You 
know what that is going to do to the 
price, Mr. President. The JPMorgan en-
ergy report said that, at a minimum, in 
2030, 8 years from now, the demand for 
oil is going to be 10 percent higher in 
America and the demand for natural 
gas is going to be 18 percent higher. 
You know what that is going to do to

prices. And the President is talking 
about this glorious transition as if this 
is going to last forever. 
I don’t know about the good people of 
Maine, but the good people of Lou-
isiana, they just can’t afford it. And 
my people deserve better. 
Now, what is the answer? Here is my 
opinion: We have got to stop spending. 
The Federal Reserve has got to be 
given a chance to do its job. The U.S. 
Congress has a budget that we have set 
for the United States of America. We 
need to live within our budget. Except 
for defense spending, we need to freeze 
spending. We need to freeze it and give 
the Federal Reserve a chance to get 
this inflation under control. 
Thank you, Mr. President. My people 
deserve better. The people of America 
deserve better. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS HEATH ROBINSON PACT 
ACT OF 2022 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from Maine for 
the recognition. I appreciate it very, 
very much. 
I will be very brief. I ask for up to 5 
minutes, which I will use less than 
that. 
Today is a historic day. Today, the 
Senate has agreed to move one step 
forward to the Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson PACT Act of 2022. I 
want to thank Ranking Member MORAN 
and Senators BOOZMAN and HEINRICH 
for working with me to help deliver 
this bipartisan solution. It is the most 
comprehensive toxic exposure package 
for our veterans that Congress has ever 
delivered in this country’s history. 
Frankly, it is one that has been years 
in the making. Actually, it has been 
decades in the making. 
Named after a veteran who died from 
exposure to a toxic burn pit, this bill 
will address decades of inaction and 
failure by the U.S. Government to do 
the right thing by delivering toxic-ex-
posed 
veterans 
their 
long-overdue 
healthcare and benefits. 
This bill spans generations of vet-
erans. It expands the presumption of 
Agent Orange exposure for those who 
served in Vietnam. Yes, that is right. 
That is what I said. We still haven’t 
done right by the Vietnam-era vet-
erans, but this bill makes it right. It 
adds new service-connected conditions 
to Agent Orange, including hyper-
tension. 
This bill also expands healthcare for 
more than 31⁄2 million post-9/11 combat 
veterans 
and 
service-connects 
two 
dozen conditions caused by burn pit ex-
posure, from cancers to lung disease. 
To pull this off, we have to give the 
VA the resources it needs to better 
serve vets. This bill does that by fund-
ing more employees to process claims, 
upgrading 
claims 
processing 
tech-
nology, authorizing innovative ways to 
hire and retain VA healthcare staff, 
and investing in VA facilities across 
the country. 
Passing this bill in Congress and get-
ting it to the President’s desk is the 
only way to keep our end of the bar-
gain to our All-Volunteer military. 
This cannot be overstated: Freedom is 
not free. There is a price to pay. We 
send men and women in uniform off to 
fight wars on our behalf. You don’t 
have to be a veteran exposed to Agent 
Orange and burn pits to understand 
that price. 
The fact is that hundreds of thou-
sands of veterans in my State and 
across this country are already paying 
for it, and they can no longer wait. So 
now is the time, folks. We are going to 
get back from Memorial Day. We are 
all going to be at Memorial Day events, 
and we are going to be celebrating the 
folks who gave the ultimate sacrifice. 
When we come back, we need to vote 
and celebrate the folks who have sur-
vived but yet have the impacts of toxic 
exposure. 
I would encourage your support for 
this bill when we get back the week of 
June 6. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF MARCIA BERNICAT 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise in support of Marcia Bernicat to be 
the Director General of the foreign 
service at the U.S. Department of 
State. Our foreign service must have a 
leader that knows how to tackle the 
challenges of the 21st century. We need 
someone that understands the impor-
tance of modernizing the State Depart-
ment workforce. We need someone who 
will prioritize diversity, equity, inclu-
sion, and accessibility to reflect our 
Nation’s wide range of backgrounds. 
Ambassador Bernicat is that person. 
She is an experienced career member of 
the Senior Foreign Service who has a 
deep understanding of the inner-work-
ings of the Department and valuable 
overseas experience. She has served as 
Ambassador to Senegal and Guinea 
Bissau and as Ambassador to Ban-
gladesh. Both times before, this body 
confirmed her by voice vote. 
While serving as Ambassador to Ban-
gladesh, she survived a terrorist attack 
on her motorcade, an experience that 
strengthened her resolve to keep For-
eign Service Officers safe while serving 
abroad. She has also worked as the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bu-
reau of Human Resources. She speaks 
French, Hindi, and Russian and is a re-
cipient of the Secretary of State’s Dis-
tinguished Service Award. She has a 
master’s degree in the science in for-
eign service at Georgetown University 
and a bachelor’s degree from Lafayette 
College. As a former Deputy Assistant 
Secretary 
working 
on 
human 
re-
sources, she understands the personnel 
challenges facing the Department. Last 
but not least, Ambassador Bernicat 
was born in the great State of New Jer-
sey. 
In short, Ambassador Bernicat is 
without a doubt the right person for 
this position. It is unacceptable that 
someone as qualified as her has been 
languishing on the Senate floor for 
more than 7 months. Her nomination 
comes at a critical time as the Depart-
ment needs leadership that will address 
key issues like attrition, training, mo-
rale, and mental health. We need our 
best people in position to ensure we are 
recruiting, retaining, promoting, and 
training the next generation of leaders. 
It is long past time to confirm Ambas-
sador Bernicat. 
I enthusiastically support Ambas-
sador Bernicat, and I respectfully urge 
my colleagues to join me in confirming 
her immediately. 
VOTE ON THE BERNICAT NOMINATION

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

f 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will 
speak for about 5 minutes or so, if that 
is OK. 
As we depart for our Memorial Day 
recess and the unofficial beginning of 
summer, many of us in political life 
will go to events honoring America’s 
fallen heroes who have died in service 
of our Nation. 
Memorial Day is different from Vet-
erans Day. On Veterans Day, we cele-
brate all those who serve. On Memorial 
Day, we have somber remembrance for 
those who failed to make it home. 
Hundreds of thousands of Americans, 
men and women from all different 
backgrounds, have died on foreign bat-
tlefields in the name of freedom and 
protecting our homeland. This is the 
one day that we set aside each year to 
remember them. 
I will do my best to rededicate myself 
to being a better American, appre-
ciating the freedoms I have, and trying 
to find a way forward for our Nation as 
a whole. So that is what this holiday 
week is about. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before 
we leave Washington, I want to make a 
few 
comments 
about 
the 
war 
in 
Ukraine. 
Our allies in Ukraine are fighting 
like tigers against a Russian invasion 
that is without foundation, that is ille-
gal under international law and is one 
of the most brutal acts of war in the 
21st century—maybe in any century. 
I just want to let the Ukrainian peo-
ple know that the American people are 
with you in your struggle for freedom. 
There have been some comments 
made by folks whom I respect talking 
about the need to end this war, where 
Ukraine has to recognize certain parts 
of their territory as actually Russian 
territory. I cannot disagree more. Any 
effort 
to 
impose 
upon 
Ukraine 
a 
ceasefire that leads to a peace agree-
ment where they have to give territory 
to Russia is not ending a war; it will be 
starting new wars. 
Have we learned nothing from the 
last 
century? 
Appeasing 
Putin 
in 
Ukraine makes him want more, not 
less. We found that to be true in the 
1930s with Hitler in Germany. 
So this idea that Ukraine needs to 
come to the table and give up Ukrain-
ian land to Putin makes zero sense to 
me. All the people who have been fight-
ing in Ukraine would have died in vain. 
And that line of reasoning I reject com-
pletely. 
Here is the state of play: Due to the 
commitment of the Ukrainian people 
to fight for their freedom and their 
homeland, Russia has just been deliv-
ered a mighty blow. Their army is in 
decline. They just changed their laws 
so that the limitation on service from 
18 to 40 now has been lifted. There was 
a 63-year-old retired general fighter 
pilot shot down in Ukraine, a Russian 
general. All I can say is that the 
Ukrainians have met their end of the 
bargain. 
This body, expressing the will of the 
American people, passed a $40 billion 
aid package. That is a lot of money, 
but you either pay now or later when it 
comes to Putin. I am convinced, along 
with most of my colleagues here, that 
if Putin is successful in Ukraine, he 
only goes further; he never stops. His 
words, not mine—he wants to recon-
struct the Soviet Union, the Russian 
Empire, whatever you would like to 
call it. There are other nations in his 
crosshairs. 
So the battle in Ukraine will sta-
bilize Europe if it is done right. If the 
battle in Ukraine ends where Putin 
feels like he got away with mass war 
crimes and was able to get territory by 
force of arms, he will not stop. China 
will, surely as I am speaking, have a 
green light to go into Taiwan. 
So those who argue that we need to 
end this war by giving Ukrainian terri-
tory to Putin, you are starting another 
war in Asia, most likely. You are going 
to create a larger appetite for Putin, 
and I think you have lost the lessons of 
the last century. 
We have much to understand about 
the nature of this war. We have Rus-
sian diplomats resigning in protest. We 
have people at concerts shouting some 
pretty vulgar things about the war. 
You have a Russian military that is 
under siege in terms of manning. The 
more 
weapons 
we 
provide 
to 
the 
Ukrainians, the more lethal they be-
come on the battlefield, the more like-
ly this war ends on favorable terms. 
So I just want to remind the Amer-
ican people as we go into this holiday, 
remember those who sacrificed for our 
freedom. There is a hot war in Europe. 
It is 2022. Did anybody really believe 
after the fall of the Berlin Wall that we 
would be having a war with Russia in 
Europe trying to take over a sovereign 
country called Ukraine? Well, that is 
where we are, and I guess one thing to 
learn about mankind is that the cal-
endar may change, but there is a dark 
side of mankind—powerful people try-
ing to push the less powerful around; 
people trying to take things through 
force of arms rather than the rule of 
law. 
So I want the Ukrainian people to 
know that I am with you. I think most 
Americans are with you. We don’t want 
you to entice Putin to go beyond 
Ukraine by surrendering your terri-
tory. We stand with you. Not 1 inch of 
Ukrainian territory should be given to 
Putin because he chose force of arms. 
The rule of law versus the rule of guns 
is at stake. I am hoping that we will 
send you more lethal weapons, not less, 
that we will increase your capability to 
inflict pain on the Russian military. 
I do believe that people in Russia are 
beginning to understand that, with 
Putin, they have a very limited future; 
that if you continue to support Putin, 
the world will isolate you further; that 
we are not going to forgive and forget 
the war crimes. 
NATO is getting bigger. Finland and 
Sweden have applied to NATO. I have 
talked to our friends in Turkey. I hope 
we can resolve that. 
So it would be wonderful in the next 
coming weeks here that the Senate, in 
fast fashion, could include two more 
members of NATO; that everything 
Putin wanted has backfired; that the 
Ukrainian nation still stands; that 
NATO is bigger not smaller; that war 
crimes investigations move forward, 
they don’t stall. 
In the International Criminal Court, 
Mr. Khan is doing a good job of gath-
ering evidence against Russian atroc-
ities committed by Russian military 
leaders and Russian forces, all under 
the control of Putin, and I just encour-
age that effort to go further. Ukrainian 
courts have convicted a Russian soldier 
of murder, a war crime. 
So what I would like to see is the 
Western world, the democratic world, 
reinforce our commitment to Ukraine, 
not talk about having to give Putin 
territory to end this war, because that 
is not the way to end the war; that is 
a way to expand the war. 
If we can end this through diplomatic 
means, great, but what should be off 
the table is rewarding Putin for this in-
vasion. What should be on the table is 
a commitment to Ukraine. As long as 
they are willing to fight, as long as 
they are willing to fight for their free-
dom and die for their territory, we 
should help them, because Putin won’t 
stop with Ukraine if he is successful. 
The blood and treasure that we have 
spent since 9/11 has been tough for our 
country, but not one American soldier 
is on the ground in Ukraine. They are 
not asking for soldiers; they are only 
asking for the ability to defend them-
selves—economic assistance, military 
assistance. 
I do not want to let the pressure off 
Putin. Senator RISCH
and Senator 
MENENDEZ—the 
chairman,

May 26, 2022 
Committee—are considering marking 
up legislation urging the Biden admin-
istration to designate Russia as a state 
sponsor of terrorism. So let’s keep the 
pressure on Putin. Let’s let the Rus-
sian people know that, as long as Putin 
is your leader, you will be isolated 
from the international community, 
your economy can’t grow, and there 
are going to be more and more young 
Russians killed in this folly. 
I would urge the Russian people to 
change course here. Pick a new leader. 
The world will embrace Russia. Russia 
is a land of many talented people, with 
a long rich history. 
I am hoping and praying that the 
freedom-loving world will not make 
the mistakes in 2022 that we made in 
1932, that we made in 1937 and 1938 
where we thought the way to end the 
war was to appease a brutal dictator. 
That is not the way to end a war; that 
is the way to continue wars and make 
them bigger. 
So, as for me, I will do everything in 
my power to help the Ukrainian people 
as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I will 
do everything in my power to hold 
Putin accountable. I will do everything 
in my power, working with my Demo-
cratic and Republican colleagues, to 
isolate Putin’s Russia. 
This is a difficult time for the world. 
If he fails in Ukraine, if the Russian 
people rise up and change course, the 
world will be a lot better off. If he suc-
ceeds, God help us all because the 
worst is yet to come. 
No problem here at home gets better 
by turning our back on Ukraine and 
not holding Putin accountable. What-
ever problems we have at the border, 
with inflation, gas prices, all the do-
mestic violence here at home, none of 
those problems get better if Putin wins 
in Ukraine. 
Here is the good news for the Amer-
ican people: The Ukrainian people are 
not asking for our young men and 
women to fight and die in Ukraine; 
they are only asking for our help. They 
need arms. They need weapons. They 
need economic assistance. If we will 
continue to show our resolve—the 
Western world—Putin will lose and the 
people of Ukraine will win. Now is not 
the time to put on the table capitula-
tion. 
So to everybody, I hope you have a 
safe Memorial Day. I look forward to 
coming back after the break to see if 
we can find a pathway forward on com-
monsense gun reforms. Between now 
and then, let’s keep the people of 
Ukraine in our prayers. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ENERGY 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about devel-
opments this week in trying to fight to 
make sure that American consumers 
aren’t paying artificially more for gas 
to fill up their cars and trucks and 
take a vacation for the holiday than 
they should be paying. 
This is an important issue for every-
body in the United States but particu-
larly 
my 
constituents, 
who 
all 
throughout the State of Washington 
are paying—well, Seattle, definitely 
over $5, and many other parts of the 
State over $5. And if you are not pay-
ing more than $5 a gallon, you are pay-
ing very close to $5 a gallon. So it is 
important that Members of Congress 
do their job in oversight and policing of 
these markets to make sure that there 
is transparency; that is, a bright light 
to make sure that no one is taking ad-
vantage during this tight supply and 
artificially driving up that price for 
their benefit. 
That is why we introduced the Trans-
portation Fuel Market Transparency 
Act that asked the Federal Trade Com-
mission to expand on authority Con-
gress already gave to them to police 
transportation petroleum markets and 
make sure that the trading that is 
done on indexes that have very little 
oversight—very little oversight—that 
those indexes have a brighter light 
shined on them so that we make sure 
consumers aren’t being gouged because 
of the kinds of practices that happen. 
Well, lo and behold, just this Tues-
day, the Federal Government and the 
Department of Justice and the CFTC— 
the 
Commodities 
Futures 
Trading 
Commission—basically gave a state-
ment on the largest settlement in his-
tory, a civil monetary penalty and 
disgorgement exceeding $1.1 billion on 
Glencore, one of the largest commodity 
trading firms. 
It is a major participant in the glob-
al, physical oil and oil derivatives mar-
ket, and for more than a decade, it en-
gaged in a wide-ranging scheme to ma-
nipulate oil markets—schemes to de-
fraud other market participants by ma-
nipulating the information going to fi-
nancial markets, schemes that created 
artificially high benchmarks so that 
Glencore’s derivatives and physical po-
sitions would settle or price at levels 
more favorable to the company. 
(Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the 
Chair.) 
These were some of the same prac-
tices that are were uncovered during 
the Enron scheme. I know the Pre-
siding Officer knows because she comes 
from the State of Nevada, and two of 
the areas most hard hit by the elec-
tricity crisis were the State of Wash-
ington and the State of Nevada. Why? 
Because people wanted us to continue 
to pay on fraudulent electricity pric-
ing. 
That is why we fought, along with 
the Presiding Officer’s predecessor and 
others, to make sure that electricity 
markets were properly policed for any 
kind of manipulative practices. 
I am very proud that we authored 
legislation after that scandal that real-
ly has given the Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission the tools it needed 
on electricity and natural gas. 
They, to this date, since 2007, have 
used that authority to police elec-
tricity and natural gas and have had 
over a $1 billion of fines and settle-
ments against companies and their bad 
practices. 
These are the same sort of practices 
that we are uncovering now in the 
commodities market and on oil market 
manipulation. 
I know my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle would like to pretend 
that this issue doesn’t exist. I ask 
them, go home and face your constitu-
ents and tell them you voted to do 
nothing—nothing—to 
bring 
more 
transparency into the gas markets that 
are affecting them today and see what 
their reaction is. I guarantee you they 
are paying too much at the pump, and 
they want to know that we are prop-
erly policing these markets. 
They get the dilemma that we are in, 
particularly given Russia and Ukraine. 
They get the issues of a changing econ-
omy coming out of COVID. But they 
are madder than heck when they read 
about some company that has been 
doing this practice for decades and ba-
sically making money off of the back 
of their hard earnings. 
Consumers could pay as much as 
$1,000 more for gas this year. They 
want to know why. This company 
raked in over $320 million in improper 
gains. And while some of the record 
settlement 
involved 
penalties 
for 
bribes and kickbacks in foreign coun-
tries, the company agreed to pay $485 
million in settlements for criminal and 
civil investigations for various fuel oil 
prices. 
Various fuel oil products that were 
manipulated and impacted included 
Los Angeles and their Bunker Fuel Oil, 
New York Harbor Low Sulfur Fuel Oil, 
New York Harbor High Sulfur Fuel, 
and U.S. Gulf Coast High Sulfur Fuel 
Oil. 
I am not sure how much consumers 
ended up getting fleeced, but it is clear 
that at least hundreds of millions of 
dollars impacted these markets. 
And as the Presiding Officer knows, 
because she has been the chief law en-
forcement for her State, if you don’t 
have a policeman on the beat policing 
these markets, more of these fraudu-
lent activities will exist. 
After the derivative crisis, I also 
made sure that anti-manipulation au-
thority went to the Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission. When we 
called recently to ask about their use 
of this authority, they told us they had 
put fines and penalties against compa-
nies at over $4.5 billion. That was be-
fore Tuesday’s announcement of clear 
oil market manipulation. 
Some of my colleagues, as we push 
this transparency bill through the 
Commerce Committee, said: Why, if 
they caught some people on Tuesday,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2728 
May 26, 2022 
do we need to mark something up on 
Wednesday? Well, the issue is that we 
were talking about the futures market. 
As I just read, these companies are 
very adept at manipulating the futures 
market and the physical market to get 
their best gain. We are asking our col-
leagues to vote for transparency in the 
physical market of indexes traded after 
the product is refined. 
We know that there is a world oil 
price. We know that it is refined. But 
what we can’t figure out is, after it is 
refined, why—particularly on the West 
Coast—is it at exorbitant rates, well 
over the national average and paying 
well over what we think market fun-
damentals determine? 
We saw, at a hearing that we had be-
fore the Commerce Committee, energy 
experts testify that some of these fun-
damentals do not make sense; that 
something else is going on in the mar-
ket. So why turn down the opportunity 
for us, as a Federal Government, to get 
more transparency in these energy 
markets? Why would anybody want to 
say that more transparency over these 
indexes is not a good idea? 
Well, some of our colleagues—I am 
not sure, because they offered no sub-
stantive amendments to the legislation 
before us. In fact, those that were, 
what I would say, some improvements 
around the edges to the bill, we actu-
ally accepted in committee. The rest of 
the amendments offered were all about 
the issues and discussions of more sup-
ply, which were out of the jurisdiction 
of our committee, and I encouraged my 
colleagues to take them up on the Sen-
ate floor. 
So no substantive changes were of-
fered to this legislation. Nobody ob-
jected on the basis of the idea that 
transparency is a bad idea. And yet 
people are holding on to an idea that 
they don’t want to answer about this 
issue of manipulation. 
Trust me, I was shocked when I was 
elected to the U.S. Senate, before I was 
even sworn in, to find out that we were 
in an energy crisis; that somehow the 
price of electricity had gone from some 
of the cheapest in the United States to 
the most exorbitant price ever, 3,000 
times the rate. I thought this couldn’t 
possibly be a scheme. This couldn’t 
possibly be something perpetrated be-
cause, obviously, we would catch that. 
Obviously, we have a policeman on the 
beat. Well, it turned out that the Cali-
fornia market, what is called the ISO, 
really wasn’t catching it, and there 
really was manipulation by Enron. 
Enron manipulated the supply of 
electricity 
by 
cooking 
up 
various 
schemes to move supply out of Cali-
fornia to create artificial shortages and 
then drive up the price of electricity. 
They had traders who lied on the phone 
to people buying long-term contracts, 
telling them: Buy the long-term con-
tract because the price is going up. And 
an analyst saying to a trader, and the 
trader replying back: That is not true. 
And the analyst saying: Tell them any-
way. That is the kind of thing that we 
need to police. 
So I was shocked to find that one of 
my first tasks being a U.S. Senator was 
going to be to spend 2 years policing 
electricity just so my State and the 
State of Nevada would not pay on 
fraudulent contracts for more than a 
decade. 
I guarantee you, not only would the 
lights in Vegas have gone out, but 
much of the Washington economy 
would have been affected. 
This is so important now because 
these high gas prices are affecting 
every sector of transportation. It is af-
fecting our airline economy. It is af-
fecting our trucking economy. I have 
heard from our railroads on the diesel 
engine prices. It is affecting every part 
of our economy while we have to pay 
more. 
And even if it is 50 cents—as one of 
the witnesses testified, it may be as 
much as 50 cents a gallon that is artifi-
cially being put onto the consumers— 
why would you not want to know the 
answer and simply give the Federal 
Trade Commission the authority to 
make sure that these markets are 
properly policed for unfair and decep-
tive practices? 
I know my colleague who is presiding 
knows because we have even had sug-
gestions from the Federal Energy Reg-
ulatory Commission that the practice 
is so bad among energy traders that we 
should consider legislation to ban en-
ergy traders who continue to per-
petrate these schemes. That is right, 
they go from one company to another 
company. They know how the schemes 
work. They think it is just the price of 
doing 
business. 
Even 
if 
they 
get 
caught, they will just pay the fine, like 
Glencore is paying now. 
If you think about it, this $1.1 billion 
is one of the largest oil market manip-
ulation cases ever. People probably 
aren’t hearing about it this week be-
cause of other stories that are in the 
news. But trust me, this kind of behav-
ior needs to be rooted out. 
So, Madam President, I hope that 
when my colleagues return, I hope that 
they will spend the recess asking their 
constituents whether they think there 
needs to be more transparency in oil 
markets. I will be very surprised if 
they don’t say that something is going 
on, and we want to know what it is. 
That is because consumers have felt for 
a long time a disconnection between 
market fundamentals of supply and de-
mand. 
And, yes, there have been some 
changes in supply as it relates to what 
we are facing on an international basis. 
My constituents understand that. But 
we have always been an isolated mar-
ket in the Pacific Northwest for refin-
eries in my State, most of the supply 
coming from Alaska. And yet we pay 
the highest prices in the Nation. So our 
constituents want to know why. 
My colleagues, Senator WYDEN, Sen-
ator FEINSTEIN, and I have prosecuted 
these issues. We have asked for more 
information and transparency. In both 
instances, when we were successful 
with electricity and natural gas, we did 
find behavior that needed to be rooted 
out. And here, we have proof now in 
this Glencore case that there is manip-
ulation in oil markets. We are simply 
asking that, just don’t leave it to the 
futures market, because if you want to 
give law enforcement, the Department 
of Justice, our attorneys general, oth-
ers, the tools to root out bad behav-
ior—even if it is 5 cents a gallon, it is 
worth fighting for. Even if it is a few 
cents more to uncover and drive down 
the cost, it is worth it to our constitu-
ents, who are paying exorbitant prices. 
Let’s make sure everybody under-
stands in a tight supply, it is a lot easi-
er to do manipulation, and that is why 
we need to get this done now. 
I wish that the authority that we had 
given to the Federal Trade Commission 
on this issue in 2007 would have been 
used, but the point is, you actually 
have to have people and the informa-
tion to prosecute these cases. 
My colleagues at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission built such a 
unit. That unit, as I said, has been suc-
cessful in monitoring electricity and 
natural gas. I hope that they will emu-
late what the Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission has done. 
I am proud that the CFTC and our 
Attorney General, Merrick Garland, 
made this announcement on Tuesday of 
this 
unbelievable 
manipulation, 
of 
bribery, of schemes, of all of the work 
that goes behind the scenes for people 
to make billions of dollars of profits 
when we and our consumers are being 
gouged with extra prices. 
Let’s find the answers. Let’s do some-
thing as basic as passing a law about 
transparency 
on 
a 
product—petro-
leum—that is so critical to our econ-
omy. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2732 
May 26, 2022 
ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
SHOOTING 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, an-
other mass shooting, another elemen-
tary school; 19 children, ages 7 through 
10, gunned down; two adults killed. 
They were in our schools—an elemen-
tary school, a place that parents send 
their children expecting it to be a safe 
zone where they can learn and interact 
with other children and be safe from 
things like being attacked and shot. An 
elementary 
school 
we 
are 
talking 
about, the anguish of the families who 
have lost their children or lost their 
loved ones. 
Children who witnessed this will be 
traumatized for life, scarred by what 
happened in Texas. 
And then last week, we saw in Buf-
falo 10 people gunned down while shop-
ping in a grocery store, very much ra-
cially motivated by a White suprema-
cist. This is happening throughout our 
country. 
We have had gun violence in Balti-
more. A few years ago, we had gun vio-
lence at Great Mills High School in 
Maryland. We are seeing this happen 
over and over and over again. 
I and all Marylanders and Americans 
are sad. We are angry; we are fearful; 
and we are frustrated. Yes, we have to 
deal with the mental health issues 
here; there is no question about that in 
my mind. Let me just point out for my 
colleagues that I join with Senator 
WYDEN and Senator CRAPO and Senator 
THUNE in releasing the draft on the 
telehealth recommendations as part of 
the mental health work that is being 
done by the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. Our Presiding Officer has been 
one of the leaders on this issue. We rec-
ognize we have to do more for mental 
health. 
Our draft discussion documents are 
dealing with telehealth. We really 
learned during COVID–19 how valuable 
telehealth is for access to care. Individ-
uals who could not get to their 
healthcare providers were able to do 
that through telehealth services. We 
also recognize how valuable telehealth 
services are in regard to mental health 
and behavioral health. It was gaining 
access that could have been denied be-
fore. This is all-important that we 
move forward on these recommenda-
tions. And we are looking at ways that 
we remove obstacles in the way for 
people in our community to be able to 
get telehealth services, removing some 
of the restrictions of the law prior to 
COVID–19 to make it easier not only 
for public insurance programs but pri-
vate insurance programs to provide for 
telehealth. 
By the way, as you know, we have 
other task forces that are working in 
regard to children’s mental health 
needs. All of that is important. We 
need to move forward on extending the 
resources and access to mental health 
services so we can identify people in 
need, give them the services they need, 
and protect our communities. 
But we need to do much more than 
mental health services in regard to 
protecting Americans from gun vio-
lence. Let me quote from the Balti-
more Sun’s editorial this morning. It is 
titled ‘‘Real Insanity Is Doing Nothing 
About Assault Weapons Again.’’ 
The terrible tragedy raises all kinds of 
questions from the mental health of the kill-
er, the inadequacy of community-based psy-
chiatric care and the bullying by classmates 
that might have contributed to his insta-
bility to the failure of those around him to 
recognize this potential threat. But one ele-
ment stands out above so many others: easy 
access to assault weapons. 
This editorial was clearly done, I 
should have mentioned, with the Texas 
tragedy that occurred this week. 
The United States is an outlier 
among the nations of the world. We 
stand alone on the number of guns we 
have per capita and amount of gun vio-
lence. That is not a category that we 
want to lead the world in, and we do. 
We have to take action. In 2021 alone, 
45,000 Americans lost their life through 
gun violence. Of that number, over 
20,000 were killed as a result of murder 
or homicide—20,000. Over 300 children 
lost their lives through gun violence in 
2021. 
As the Washington Post editorial 
noted in yesterday’s editorial, the ele-
mentary school shooting in Texas was 
‘‘one of at least 24 acts of gun violence 
of K–12 campuses so far this year in 
which at least 28 people have been 
killed . . . [this] came a day after a 
FBI report showing a sharp increase 
last year in active-shooter attacks na-
tionwide. In 2020, for the first time, 
firearms became the leading cause of 
death for American children and teen-
agers, supplanting car accidents.’’ 
We lost our way. We need to do much 
more. How many children have to die 
before we act? When is enough enough? 
Congress needs to take up and pass 
commonsense gun safety legislation. 
I am going to give a few examples of 
legislation I hope we can take up and 
consider. First, the Assault Weapons 
Ban Act. Ban the sale. We have legisla-
tion, S. 736, that bans the sale, manu-
facture, transfer, and importation of 
assault weapons, including military- 
style weapons. 
The Baltimore Sun also talked about 
this. This is the Sunday paper’s edi-
torial: 
These are not components one needs in 
self-defense, not the essentials required for 
target practice [or] local shooting range, not 
an asset [that] the average deer hunter 
[needs]. They are, however, the common 
tools of mass shooters. It’s been estimated 
that about one-quarter of such incidents 
have involved individuals armed with assault 
weapons. 
The public does not need assault 
weapons for self-defense. They don’t 
need it for recreational use. They don’t 
need it. These are military-style weap-
ons and should have no place in private 
ownership. We should take action in 
order to make our communities safer 
and our children safer. We should pass 
the Bipartisan Background Check Ex-
pansion 
Act, 
which 
would 
require 
checks for all gun sales, including 
those from unlicensed sellers. By the 
way, the House has already passed this 
action. 
And we should pass the Enhanced 
Background Check Completion Act. 
That is an act that would eliminate the 
so-called Charleston loophole that al-
lows for gun sales to go forward if a 
check is not completed within 3 days, 
which is an unrealistic requirement 
that we have. 
These are just commonsense gun 
safety bills that could be passed. We 
should pass the Keep Americans Safe 
Act, S. 1108, which would prohibit im-
portation, sale, manufacture, transfer, 
or possession of magazines that hold 
more than 10 rounds of ammunition. 
Why does anyone, for a lawful purpose, 
need an ammunition magazine that 
holds more than 10 rounds? The mass 
killers use it. We shouldn’t make it 
easier for them to carry out these 
atrocities. 
Let me just mention the one option 
that should not be on the table, and 
that option is to do nothing. How many 
children have to die before enough is 
enough? Doing nothing about the epi-
demic of guns across this country is 
killing our children. We must work to-
gether to translate our grief into col-
lective action. Enough is enough. Let 
us act. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE LIVINGSTON 
AND GERTRUDE SVARNY 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is Thursday, and it is the time of the 
week that I like to celebrate an amaz-
ing person or people in my State who 
are doing something great for Alaska, 
great for America, great for the world. 
It is someone I like to refer to as our 
Alaskan of the Week—or Alaskans of 
the Week, plural. 
So we are doubling up this week be-
cause we have two Alaskans that we 
are going to be commemorating. And I 
want to acknowledge it has been a cou-
ple of rough weeks for America—we all 
know that—for reasons that are quite 
obvious. Some tempers here in the Sen-
ate have been flaring a little bit. So I 
wanted to end the week on what is 
really an incredible, uplifting story, an 
epic story. It is a bit complicated, so 
you have to pay attention if you are 
wanting to hear about just a remark-
able course of events in Alaska. 
And it is a particularly poignant 
story as we head into Memorial Day 
weekend, a time when we honor those 
who have made the ultimate sacrifice. 
And I am going to tell, as I mentioned, 
a very special Memorial Day story—a

May 26, 2022 
complicated one, but one for the his-
tory books. 
This story has twists and turns, dark 
spots, highlights, and literally a Holly-
wood ending, one that involves a hero 
who gave his life for America, what we 
are celebrating on Monday, but whose 
heroism and service was only recently 
acknowledged and even only recently 
remembered. 
So, first, I am going to begin the 
story about a young man who made the 
ultimate sacrifice for our Nation, an 
Alaskan native, an indigenous man 
from Unalaska—Private George Fox. 
Now, Private George Fox is not our 
Alaskan of the Week, but the whole 
story that I am going to tell revolves 
around Private George Fox, who was 
killed in action fighting Nazis in World 
War II in Italy in 1944 and, since 1949, 
was buried on the island of Unalaska— 
that is out on the Aleutian island 
chain in Alaska, the islands way out 
that go out towards Japan. But he was 
buried in an unmarked grave and es-
sentially forgotten—no record of mili-
tary service, no awards for heroism, 
nothing, forgotten by literally almost 
everybody but one person, for nearly 80 
years. 
I am also going to talk about two 
very special people who are our Alas-
kans of the Week; that is Mike Living-
ston and Gertrude Svarny, who worked 
over the years to make sure that Pri-
vate George Fox’s exceptional service 
is finally going to be officially recog-
nized. And that will happen Monday, 
on Memorial Day on the island of Un-
alaska in the Aleutian Island chains 
back home in Alaska in a ceremony 
that will take place on Monday. 
So, as you can tell, this is actually a 
story of three people: one of them a 
young soldier killed in action for our 
country in World War II; one of them a 
still-living 90-year-old woman, a child-
hood friend of the young soldier, one of 
our Alaskans of the Week, Gertrude; 
another, a man on a mission, a detec-
tive with a public servant’s heart. 
It is a story of the invasion of the 
United States by the Japanese. Many 
Americans don’t know that Japan in-
vaded parts of Alaska. It is a story of 
racism, discrimination, service, honor, 
heroism. It is the story of how two peo-
ple worked to keep history alive and to 
honor another who was forgotten for 
his heroism fighting and dying for our 
country. 
It is an epic of Alaska—an epic of 
Alaska—fitting to be memorialized 
here on the U.S. Senate floor, and, 
more importantly, memorialized Mon-
day when we honor our veterans and 
those who died in the service of our 
country. 
So, it is a little complicated, but bear 
with me. Let me start this remarkable 
story in a remarkable place. 
This is Unalaska on the Aleutian Is-
land chain. So if you are looking at a 
map of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands go 
way out west, actually the Aleutian Is-
lands cross the international date line, 
way further west than Hawaii. The 
Aleutian Island chain of Unalaska is a 
beautiful island about 800 miles south-
west of Anchorage in the Bering Sea. It 
is home to walruses and sea lions; tens 
of millions of birds migrate through 
the area. 
Right now, it is the largest fishing 
port in the country, and it is home to 
an incredible group of patriotic people, 
the Unangan native people, living in an 
area steeped in fascinating and some-
times very tragic history. 
So here is a short version of that his-
tory. First, when Alaska was a colonial 
possession of Russia, Russian fur seek-
ers decimated the Aleuts, the native 
populations on these islands, through 
warfare, disease, even slavery. 
Then, 75 years after the United 
States purchased Alaska from Russia, 
during World War II, Japan actually 
bombed Unalaska, June 3 and 4, almost 
80 years ago today. 
Then the Japanese invaded and occu-
pied nearby islands on Alaska’s Aleu-
tian Island chain. Many Americans 
don’t know that history. 
The United States—Alaska—was ac-
tually occupied by our enemy, Imperial 
Japan. Eventually, American forces 
had to drive out the Japanese in a bru-
tal campaign on the Aleutian Islands 
area. About 1,500 American service-
members were killed in those battles, 
600 missing, and almost 3,500 wounded 
in action. 
So that is some of the history of Un-
alaska and the Aleutian Islands chain 
during World War II. 
So, George Fox—at about the same 
time the Japanese were literally bomb-
ing his hometown of Unalaska in 1942, 
George Fox had volunteered as a patri-
otic young American Alaska Native to 
fight for his country and was sent to 
the other side of the world—Europe, 
North Africa. 
Now, we don’t know a lot about Pri-
vate Fox’s service, but because of the 
work of Mike Livingston, our other 
Alaskan of the Week, who is alive and 
doing great, we do have some basic in-
formation. 
Here is some of what we know about 
Private George Fox. He was born Janu-
ary 20, 1920, in Unalaska—again, the 
Aleutian island that we are taking 
about on the Aleutian Islands chain. 
When he was 22 years old, like so many 
patriotic Alaska Natives, he signed up 
to serve his country in World War II. 
By the way, it should be noted and 
cannot be overstated that throughout 
history, even though so many Alaska 
Natives were discriminated against— 
and still are in some ways—Alaska Na-
tives, certainly in Unalaska but all 
throughout the whole State, have 
served at higher rates in the military 
than any other ethnic group in the 
country—incredible patriotic service. 
So Private George Fox from Un-
alaska goes to war for his country in 
World War II. At the same time, his 
hometown is being bombed by the Jap-
anese. He was assigned to Company G 
in the 179th Infantry Regiment of the 
45th Infantry Division. His unit was 
first sent to fight the Axis Powers in 
North Africa, then to Italy, where he 
landed in Italy on Anzio Beach—a very 
famous battle—to fight the Germans in 
the famous Battle of Anzio, where 
roughly 7,000 Allied servicemembers 
were killed in action. 
He survived that and fought his way 
heroically toward Rome, fighting the 
Nazis the whole way. Unfortunately, on 
June 1, 1944, a Nazi bomb exploded near 
him, and he was killed in action as a 
young American serving his country— 
killed in Italy. 
He 
is 
the 
only 
known 
Alaska 
Unangan from his region to be killed in 
action during World War II. 
So about 5 years later, after the war, 
his remains were removed from Italy 
and returned to Unalaska in 1949. We 
now know there was a small funeral at 
the Russian Orthodox church, where 
his ashes were buried next to his mom, 
but 
his 
grave 
was 
unmarked—un-
marked—and it stayed unmarked for 
decades. 
Now, that is what we know about 
Private Fox’s military service, not 
much else. Why? Because there was a 
fire where all his military records were 
in the lower 48, and his service records 
were destroyed. So, frankly, his record 
in the military was essentially forgot-
ten—forgotten. 
Now, I think—you can’t prove this, 
but the fact that he was Alaska Na-
tive—that there was probably some dis-
crimination here, like, ‘‘Hey, whatever, 
he is Alaska Native. We are not that 
worried.’’ And so nobody in authority 
kept his memory alive, his service 
alive. It was all forgotten, that he was 
even a soldier. 
So his memory and his service and 
his heroism—because these are serious 
battles in World War II—all faded al-
most completely to nothing, if it 
wasn’t for our heroic Alaskans of the 
Week that we are recognizing today. 
So enter our first Alaskan of the 
Week, Mike Livingston, also a Native 
Alaskan, Unangan, and he was deter-
mined to remember this vague memory 
of this guy he had heard about, Private 
George Fox. 
Here is a little bit of Mike’s story, 
which is another great story. 
He was born in Cold Bay, AK, which 
is another island in the Aleutian Is-
lands chain. He moved to Unalaska, the 
town we are talking about, in 1978, as a 
college student to learn the art of 
building traditional kayaks from the 
Native elders in the community, and he 
began to work as a public safety offi-
cer. 
From then until 2003, when he re-
tired, he was an emergency medical 
technician, a firefighter, a dive rescue 
specialist, a police officer, a detective 
in various places throughout Alaska, 
much of it in Anchorage at the Anchor-
age Police Department, and he is cur-
rently a captain with the Alaska State 
Defense Force. 
Along the way—now, this guy is real-
ly impressive, what Mike did. He re-
ceived a master’s degree in anthro-
pology and a doctorate in education,

all of which he uses as a specialist in 
his job, also at the Aleutian Pribilof Is-
land Association, and he uses his edu-
cation and skills also as a detective 
and fuels his passion for helping people 
help solve mysteries, particularly in 
his interest of genealogy and family 
trees that involve stories that are un-
told mysteries. A tree nut—a family 
tree nut—he calls himself, as do his 
group of friends who dig deep to solve 
puzzles, the kind of which involve peo-
ple, historic places, lapses in historic 
knowledge that have faded into his-
tory, which is exactly what happened 
to Private George Fox. 
Around 2005, Mike Livingston, our 
Alaskan of the Week, and his friends 
started to take on that mission. What 
happened to Private George Fox? They 
had heard about him—a fellow Alaska 
Native who they knew from stories was 
killed in action fighting somewhere in 
World War II—but they needed more 
information. Where was he buried? No-
body seemed to know. Why was he not 
listed as killed in action in service in 
World War II? 
In the U.S. military, when a service-
member is killed in action, the sur-
vivors get benefits, and they are enti-
tled to receive full military honors at 
funerals. 
And in Mike’s culture and in Private 
Fox’s culture—the Unangan culture— 
when a warrior died protecting their 
village, statues were carved, songs 
were written and sung. It has always 
been a huge honor in the Native cul-
ture to be a fallen warrior, but Private 
George Fox got none of this from 
America, from his Federal Govern-
ment, and even from the amazing Alas-
ka Native people. 
Mike Livingston, the detective with 
a servant’s heart, wanted to right this 
wrong. He wanted to do it for Private 
Fox, for his community, for his people, 
for his State, for his country. So he got 
to work on this mystery. He began to 
dig deeper. 
He called every Federal Agency he 
could think of to try to get more infor-
mation about this mysterious Alaska 
Native whose memory had faded, whose 
heroism wasn’t recognized. But Mike 
ran into brick wall after brick wall 
calling Federal Agencies. He was able 
to get a few tidbits, like the basic in-
formation mentioned above, and he 
also discovered that George Fox’s re-
mains were returned to Unalaska in 
1949, but nothing else—little else. 
The mystery of where those remains 
were—in a grave, an unmarked grave; 
where Private George Fox was buried— 
it haunted Mike Livingston. 
As he said, ‘‘When you compare some 
of what occurred during World War II, 
or shortly after World War II, people 
who were white were highly honored,’’ 
he recently told a reporter, particu-
larly if they were killed in action dur-
ing the war—but not so for so many 
Alaska Natives. 
Eventually, Mike heard that another 
resident on the island—now we are 
back on Unalaska—had a piece of the 
puzzle, a woman who happened to be 
related to Mike through marriage. 
Enter our second Alaskan of the 
Week, 
91-year-old 
artist 
Gertrude 
Svarny. Let me spend a few minutes 
talking about her incredible patriotic 
story. 
Gertrude was born in 1930 on Un-
alaska, the island out in the Aleutian 
Islands chain, the island bombed by the 
Japanese. She was also Alaska Native. 
Her family lived next to the Fox fam-
ily. George Fox was about 8 years older 
than she was. George and Gertrude’s 
older brother were good friends. So 
Gertrude remembers George. She said 
the whole island loved him. He was 
kind, funny, full of life, and obviously 
brave. 
As I mentioned, in 1942, George Fox 
left to go fight World War II for our 
great Nation, right at the time George 
and Gertrude’s village, Unalaska, was 
bombed by the Japanese. 
And here is another story most 
Americans don’t know about. After 
that happened, the U.S. Government 
took the Alaska Native people on the 
Aleutian Islands chain and put them 
into internment camps—not White peo-
ple, only Alaska Native people. 
The treatment of these great patri-
otic American citizens in these camps 
is a dark spot in American history 
that, as I mentioned, not many Ameri-
cans are aware of. Camps were basi-
cally abandoned buildings. The condi-
tions were awful—crowded, unheated, 
unsanitary. Many died in the camps as 
a result of these horrendous conditions. 
Three years later, when the war was 
finally over, the people of Unalaska— 
the Native people of Unalaska—were 
allowed to go home to their commu-
nity after being in these internment 
camps, but their homes were ransacked 
and burned. Many of their villages on 
the island were destroyed, another 
dark spot in our country’s history. 
Remember, these were our citizens, 
our country, and the Native people, if 
they weren’t at home, many of them 
were fighting overseas in the Pacific 
and in Europe, like Private George 
Fox. 
So Gertrude comes home from the in-
ternment camp. She is at Unalaska 
now, and she marries another patriot 
named Sam Svarny, her husband, who 
was in the Army, originally from Chi-
cago, and he was stationed in Un-
alaska. Another patriot in this story, 
Sam served in World War II and later 
served in Vietnam. 
Gertrude became an artist—a re-
nowned artist in Alaska. She is actu-
ally very famous for her work that she 
makes out of traditional materials, and 
she is in collections all over the world. 
And even though her childhood was 
marked by the wrongs inflicted on her 
family and her by her own country, she 
and her husband have remained fierce-
ly patriotic. Even interment hasn’t dis-
suaded the patriotism of the Alaska 
Native people. And one of the ways 
Gertrude displayed this patriotism, 
which still burns in her to this day—re-
member, she is 91 years old—was that 
every Memorial Day, they put flags on 
the grave sites on the island of Un-
alaska to those who served in the mili-
tary. 
Gertrude and her husband Sam al-
ways remembered when she was a 
young girl the small service that she 
had attended, a funeral service in 1949, 
of the young, spritely teenager George 
Fox, a friend of Gertrude’s who died 
fighting the Nazis more than 5,000 
miles away from Alaska in Italy. 
The service was in the winter, she re-
members. It was very cold. After the 
service, the small procession walked in 
the frigid winds to the cemetery where 
George Fox’s mother was buried. 
So, every year, this patriotic Alaska 
Native woman, for decades, has quietly 
visited the unmarked grave of Private 
George Fox to place a flag on this un-
marked grave to remember his service, 
and that is the only living memory of 
what this young patriotic Alaska Na-
tive soldier did for his country. 
When her husband Sam passed away 
in 2014, Gertrude continued this tradi-
tion even to this day, as I mentioned, 
at 91 years old. What a patriot. 
So here is how it all comes together. 
When our detective, another Alaskan 
of the Week, Mike Livingston, finally 
learned that his own relative through 
marriage, 
Gertrude, 
actually 
knew 
where Private Fox was buried, he got 
to work. The mystery was coming to-
gether. He felt like he had enough in-
formation to make the official case to 
the U.S. Government to finally get Pri-
vate George Fox, this American hero, 
recognized. 
He wrote up an affidavit. Gertrude 
signed it, stating how she had been 
putting a flag on the unmarked grave 
site for decades. But still, request after 
request was ignored by the U.S. Gov-
ernment. 
So what did they do, Mike and Ger-
trude? Well, to all Americans and Alas-
kans watching this, here is what they 
did. They called their U.S. Senator. 
This was now in 2020, at the height of 
COVID. When my office heard about 
this, my former head of casework, Ra-
chel Bylsma, got immediately onto the 
case. We all said that this is so impor-
tant to make sure Private George Fox 
got the honor and recognition he de-
served. So we worked together. 
And I am proud to say, he is going to 
be getting that recognition. Here is 
what is going to happen on Unalaska in 
the Aleutian Island chain this Monday, 
2022 Memorial Day for America: The 
top military officials in my State, so 
many members of Private George Fox’s 
family, so many members of the com-
munity, myself, and my team are going 
to gather in Unalaska, and we are 
going to gather to honor a warrior, a 
hero, an Unangan Alaskan, an Amer-
ican, on Memorial Day. 
Gertrude will be there, and Mike will 
be there, our two Alaskans of the 
Week. Hundreds of people will be there. 
There will be a procession from the

Russian Orthodox church to the ceme-
tery, and we have now a beautiful 4- 
foot-high gravestone to be unveiled. 
Taps will float from a bugle. There 
will be a 21-gun salute from the 4th 
Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division. 
And on Memorial Day in Unalaska, in 
the Bering Sea, the man who fought 
and died in World War II as a hero for 
his country in North Africa, in Italy on 
Anzio Beach, this American hero who 
has been forgotten will be recognized 
because of the work of so many but, in 
particular, the relentless work of our 
Alaskans of the Week Mike Livingston 
and Gertrude Svarny. 
Private George Fox’s service and sac-
rifice and heroism will finally be recog-
nized on Memorial Day by our Govern-
ment, and we will have a gravestone 
befitting of his incredible patriotic 
service. 
On that gravestone, which I have 
seen—it is beautiful—at the bottom 
there will be engraved three words. 
These words came from George Fox to 
his family in his last letter that he 
wrote from Anzio Beach in a heroic 
battle a world away from Alaska when 
he was fighting to save the soul of the 
world from tyranny. There are three 
words in that letter—that are now on a 
gravestone—that meant so much then 
and, I would argue, mean so much now 
for our country to this very day. The 
three words on that headstone are 
‘‘Wish all love.’’ ‘‘Wish all love.’’ The 
last words of a patriotic Alaska Native, 
sent home from Italy to his family, 
who on Memorial Day will finally be 
recognized due to the heroic, relentless 
hard work of our two Alaskans of the 
Week, Mike and Gertrude. Thank you 
for all you are doing, all you have done 
for your community, for your State, 
and for your country. 
Thank you to George Fox’s family 
and to Private George Fox for his in-
credible service. 
I look forward to seeing you all in 
Unalaska in a few days. It is going to 
be a great ceremony. Congratulations 
on being our Alaskans of the Week as 
we head into Memorial Day weekend. 
I yield the floor.

STANDARDIZATION 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 349, S. 1941. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1941) to direct the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget to stand-
ardize the use of core-based statistical area 
designations across Federal programs, to 
allow between 120 and 180 days for public 
comment on any proposed change to such 
designations, and to report on the scientific 
basis and estimated impact to Federal pro-
grams for any proposed change to such des-
ignations, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs, with an amendment to 
strike all after the enacting clause and 
insert in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Metropolitan 
Areas Protection and Standardization Act of 
2021’’ or the ‘‘MAPS Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Federal programs use core-based statistical 
area delineations to determine the delivery of 
Federal services, benefits, and funding to people 
in the United States, such as in criteria for eligi-
bility or distribution. 
(2) Core-based statistical area delineations 
provide a nationally consistent set of standards 
for collecting, tabulating, and publishing Fed-
eral statistics for geographic areas, and they are 
not intended for any public or private sector 
non-statistical uses such as program administra-
tion or service delivery. 
(3) Updates to core-based statistical area de-
lineations may cause widespread disruption to 
the delivery of Federal services, benefits, and 
funding to people in the United States based on 
the reliance of Federal programs on these delin-
eations. 
(4) There does not exist any comprehensive list 
of Federal programs that rely on core-based sta-
tistical area delineations. Such a list is valuable 
for the study of how Federal services, benefits, 
and funding are distributed to people in the 
United States. 
(5) Increased transparency on the impacts of 
any update to core-based statistical area delin-
eations may be overly burdensome due to the 
anticipated variety of Federal programs that 
rely on these delineations. Any requirement for 
complete disclosure of these impacts prior to im-
plementation of new delineations may uninten-
tionally cause the existing delineations to ossify. 
(6) In order to prevent any disruption to serv-
ice delivery of Federal programs based on up-
dates to core-based statistical area delineations, 
and ensure the independence of Federal statis-
tical policymaking, Congress must sever the link 
between future updates to core-based statistical 
area delineations and any automatic impact on 
Federal programs that rely on these delinea-
tions. 
SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
This purpose of this Act is to ensure— 
(1) transparency in how core-based statistical 
area delineations are used in domestic assist-
ance programs; and 
(2) independence of the Office of Management 
and Budget in establishing and updating core- 
based statistical area delineations.

THE RESTORATION AND PRESER-
VATION OF THE SHUL MURAL 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize the Ohavi Zedek 
community and former Vermont Gov-
ernor and U.S. Ambassador to Switzer-
land Madeleine Kunin for their efforts 
to preserve and restore the Shul Mural. 
Painted in 1910 by Ben Zion Black, the 
mural 
was 
commissioned 
by 
Bur-
lington’s Lithuanian Jewish commu-
nity, who had come to Vermont from 
the town of Kovno and its environs to 
escape Russian pogroms. 
The immigrants founded the Ohavi 
Zedek Synagogue in 1885 and the Chai 
Adam Synagogue 4 years later. It was 
at the latter synagogue that the Shul 
Mural was painted. Stretching from 
floor to ceiling, it depicts the Tent of 
the Tabernacle, as described in the 
Book of Numbers. The style in which it 
was painted was well-known to the 
members of Chai Adam, as it could be 
found in synagogues throughout East-
ern Europe. Now, the Shul Mural is one 
of the few remaining examples of this 
style of painting in the world. The 
works which inspired it were de-
stroyed, as part of the burning of syna-
gogues and the extermination of mil-
lions of Eastern European Jews by the 
Nazis, including the decimation of 
Lithuania’s Jewish population. 
In Burlington, the Ohavi Zedek and 
Chai Adam synagogues merged in 1939. 
Chai Adam was sold. The building went 
through multiple uses and in 1986 the 
mural was covered with a false wall to 
protect it at the urging of Jeffrey Pot-
ash, a historian and Ohavi Zedek’s ar-
chivist. 
In 2012, the building was sold once 
again. The new owner agreed to donate 
the mural to Ohavi Zedek and efforts 
began to move the mural, a massive 
undertaking 
that 
was 
successfully 
completed in 2015. Since then, work has 
been underway to fully restore the 
painting. 
The relocation and restoration of the 
mural were a significant undertaking, 
with costs exceeding $1 million. The 
funding came from foundations, his-
toric preservation groups, arts organi-
zations, and individuals. 
Governor Kunin, herself a Jewish im-
migrant, lent her leadership skills to 
the effort, chairing the Friends of the 
Mural Board. Governor Kunin’s parents 
were German Jews who fled to Switzer-
land, where her father died. Her mother 
brought Madeleine and her brother, 
Edgar, to the United States to escape 
the Nazis when Madeleine was 6 years 
old and Edgar 10. Although her imme-
diate family survived the Holocaust, 
Governor Kunin lost extended family 
in the concentration camps. She is fond 
of saying both she and the mural are 
survivors. 
Despite having arrived in the United 
States at a time of rising nativism, 
racism, and anti-Semitism, the fami-
lies which had originally arrived from 
Lithuania continued to encourage their 
friends and former neighbors to follow 
them. At its peak, the community had 
more than a thousand members in Bur-
lington. That community 
produced 
leaders in a number of fields, including 
Robert Larner, a physician who treated 
soldiers at Guadalcanal and Okinawa, 
and for whom Vermont’s only medical 
school is now named, and Ed Colodny, 
the former CEO of U.S. Air. 
While the story of Burlington’s Lith-
uanian Jewish community is unique, it 
is also a perfect example of what immi-
grants have brought and continue to 
bring to the United States. They enrich 
our country and society by sharing 
their art, their culture, and their expe-
rience. 
The story of the Shul Mural, the peo-
ple who commissioned and created it, 
and those who ensured its preservation 
for future generations, is a Jewish 
story, an immigrant story, and a 
quintessentially American story. 
f 
RECOGNIZING EARTH PRIME 
COMICS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have 
long told the story of my love for Bat-
man comics dating back to my younger 
years growing up in Montpelier, VT. 
When I was 4 years old, I would race to 
the Kellogg Hubbard Library in Mont-
pelier with my latest Batman comic. 
As a child, reading comic books al-
lowed me, like so many others, to 
broaden the expanses of my imagina-
tion. While Spider-Man and Superman 
are fine, I have always preferred Bat-
man. His values, his pursuit of justice, 
his balance of human strength and vul-
nerability have always resonated with 
me. 
I would like to take a moment today 
to recognize a store where I have 
bought more than my fair share of 
‘‘The Dark Knight,’’ an institution 
foundational to the comic-loving com-
munity in Vermont: Earth Prime Com-
ics. 
Founded in 1983, Earth Prime Comics 
was one of Vermont’s first comic book 
stores. It began as a shared venture be-
tween 
Christine 
Farrell 
and 
John 
Young, first operating out of John 
Young’s attic in Burlington, VT. In 
that attic, John and Christine’s exten-
sive collection of comics quickly gar-
nered a surprisingly large following. 
Earth Prime Comics soon moved into a 
real retail space: a converted Victorian 
house on Bank Street in Burlington. 
Requiring even more space for its 
growing business, Earth Prime moved 
to a storefront on Church Street in 
Burlington in 1989, a location where it 
has remained for 33 years. 
Over the past few decades, Earth 
Prime Comics has drawn comic book 
fans from across Vermont and forged a 
comic-loving 
community 
where 
all 
were welcome. Christine still owns 
Earth Prime Comics, and it has been 
great to see how she and her team have 
continued to build and shape their 
community to keep pace with the ever- 
changing comic landscape. In the years 
to come, I have full faith that comic 
lovers of all ages will continue to

Earth Prime Comics, as I have on so 
many occasions. 
Earth Prime Comics was recently 
featured in an article published earlier 
this year in ‘‘Seven Days.’’ I ask unani-
mous consent that excerpts from the 
article, titled ‘‘Origin Story: How Bur-
lington’s Earth Prime Comics helped 
unite Vermont’s comic lovers,’’ be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Seven Days, Mar. 2, 2022] 
ORIGIN
STORY: HOW
BURLINGTON’S
EARTH 
PRIME
COMICS
HELPED
UNITE
VERMONT’S 
COMIC LOVERS 
(By Chris Farnsworth) 
I was 10 years old, staring at a strange 
house on Bank Street. 
It was late summer, and my mother was in-
side the Burlington Square Mall shopping, so 
my brother Pat and I were cut loose to inves-
tigate the comic book shop across the street. 
Shadows from the trees in the yard cast the 
house in a mysterious darkness, making it 
resemble some Jungian archetype of a cave. 
Pat and I were no rubes, despite our ages— 
Pat was 9. We’d been to the comic shops in 
New York City. We had a growing collection 
of X-Men and The New Mutants comics in-
herited from family friends. Hell, we had the 
Longshot miniseries, something we were 
rather proud of—and continue to be 30 years 
later. 
Still, the house didn’t look like a comic 
shop, and we climbed the porch stairs with 
trepidation. We’d only been Vermonters for a 
little while, and when you’re the new kids in 
town, caution is a defense against dis-
appointment. 
I heard Pat gasp and followed his gaze to a 
poster taped inside the window. Staring out 
was the ferocious visage of Wolverine, leap-
ing at us with adamantium claws drawn. Our 
hero. 
This was the late 1980s, more than a decade 
before Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and the 
rest of the X-Men ushered in the age of 
superhero 
films 
dominating 
multiplexes. 
Back then, you wrote letters by hand to the 
publishers of comic books—and sometimes 
they answered. Comics fandom in the ’80s 
was a club, and Pat and I were pledges stand-
ing before the clubhouse. 
Steeling our nerves, we entered the store 
and breathed in the smell of newsprint and 
cardboard, the telltale musk of a good comic 
shop. Posters on the walls depicted more of 
our favorite characters, alongside many we 
had yet to discover. The mystery of these 
strange heroes and villains filled us with ten-
sion, a curiosity that had to be satiated. 
But the real treat was the comics them-
selves. Even before we got to see the back- 
issue room, we salivated over the sheer num-
ber of books on display. 
A bearded, longhaired man with a knowing 
grin looked at the two kids who’d wandered 
in with wide eyes. 
‘‘Well,’’ I remember him saying, almost 
smugly, ‘‘looks like you found your place.’’ 
Our place, as the shopkeeper called it, was 
Earth Prime Comics. One of Vermont’s first 
comic book shops, Earth Prime has been a 
center of the state’s comic community since 
it moved out of original co-owner John 
Young’s attic and into that Bank Street 
house-turned-shop in 1983. The shop has re-
mained a polestar in its current home on the 
bottom block of the Church Street Market-
place, where it moved in 1989. 
‘‘Not many places downtown have been 
around longer,’’ said Bill Simmon, who man-
aged Earth Prime from 1989 to 1998. ‘‘Old 
Gold, Pure Pop, maybe a few others? You can 
count them on one hand, I bet. Earth Prime 
is an institution.’’ 
In its 39 years, Earth Prime has fostered 
generations of local comic fans, helping 
some of them go on to become comic artists 
themselves. The store has survived and 
thrived through the excitement of the under-
ground comics explosion in the ’80s, through 
the crisis and near collapse of the industry 
in the ’90s—all the way to the modern epoch 
when movies and shows based on Marvel and 
DC Comics monopolize pop culture and, some 
say, draw interest away from their source 
material. 
The little shop on Church Street is driven 
by the passion of its mysterious proprietor, 
Christine Farrell, who is rumored to have 
one of the largest and oldest private collec-
tions of comics on the planet. While Sen. 
Patrick Leahy (D–Vt.) may be Vermont’s 
most famous Batman fan, she’s said to have 
been collecting Bruce Wayne’s exploits from 
the very beginning. 
Farrell’s store has been as much a club-
house for the comic community to celebrate 
groundbreaking independent creators as a 
place to pick up the latest issue of Iron Man. 
It’s no longer the only comic store in 
Vermont—many have come and gone over 
the decades, and the state is currently home 
to Barre’s Wonder Cards and Comics and 
Rutland’s newly opened Night Legion Com-
ics. But Earth Prime has a special status for 
veterans of the scene. 
‘‘I have to give all due respect and honor to 
Earth Prime,’’ Stephen Bissette said. The 
Duxbury native is one of Vermont’s most in-
fluential and respected comic artists, having 
established himself with a seminal run in the 
early 1980s on Saga of the Swamp Thing with 
Alan Moore. He has taught for 15 years at 
the Center for Cartoon Studies in White 
River Junction. 
Earth Prime has ‘‘outlived every Vermont 
comic shop I’ve ever been to,’’ Bissette said. 
‘‘Long may that continue.’’ 
IT CAME FROM THE UNDERGROUND 
Earth Prime’s arrival in the ’80s was per-
fectly timed, as the world of comics was un-
dergoing a revolution on the national stage. 
Meanwhile, in Vermont, the store united a 
ragtag crew of comic fans into a community. 
‘‘I find, with people like us, it’s inevitable, 
right?’’ said John Odum, who hosts a podcast 
about all things geek called ‘‘Open World 
Chat.’’ ‘‘It’s part of being a comic fan. Even-
tually, we all start finding each other. It’s 
just a question of where.’’ 
Odum is the Montpelier city clerk and a 
freelance writer for comics sites such as 
Bleeding Cool. He grew up during the inde-
pendent comics revolution of the ’80s, when 
artists like Bissette and Veitch started push-
ing back against the censorship of their 
youth, working with writers far removed 
from the kid-friendly scripts of Stan Lee. 
Moore’s Watchmen series and Miller’s 
dark, noir-tinged work on Batman and Dare-
devil changed the mainstream superhero 
books. The arrival of titles such as Cerebus 
and Elfquest marked the rise of the under-
ground. 
‘‘The 1980s changed comics,’’ Odum said. 
Veitch agrees. 
‘‘The ’80s for comics were like the ’60s for 
music,’’ he said. ‘‘For a short time, before 
the moneymen caught on, the inmates got 
control of the asylum.’’ 
Earth Prime was at the forefront of that 
movement in Vermont. Its reputation drew 
fans from all over the state. 
DON’T CALL IT A COMEBACK 
As the 1980s wound up, the scene changed 
at Earth Prime. Amidon left for Massachu-
setts. Many of the first-generation Earth 
Prime kids grew up and either moved away, 
as Pat and I did in 1989, or simply lacked the 
time they once had to hang out at the shop 
all day. 
‘‘The family atmosphere kind of changed,’’ 
Simmon said. ‘‘It was still fun to be there 
and talk comics, but look, we weren’t kids 
anymore. Life tends to get more serious, 
even at comic shops.’’ 
In the spring of 1989, Farrell bought out 
Young’s half of the business and moved 
Earth Prime to its current spot at 152 
Church Street. Though none of the original 
gang wanted to go into details, they implied 
that some sort of schism occurred between 
the two founders of Earth Prime. Young 
opened Comics City at the other end of 
downtown Burlington, before moving eventu-
ally to Winooski. Customers were split; 
many, 
like 
Rovnak, 
switched 
over 
to 
Young’s new store. 
Within a few years, the entire comics in-
dustry was rocked like never before, as its 
own increasing cultural legitimacy sent it 
into a boom-and-bust cycle. Collectors start-
ed snapping up ‘‘big event’’ books such as 
The 
Death 
of 
Superman 
and 
Batman: 
Knightfall, creating a bloat in the speculator 
market that coincided with a disastrous de-
cision by Marvel to bypass the distributors 
and form its own distribution wing. When 
the market crashed, the company was stuck 
with multiple printings of variant issues 
that were meant to be ‘‘collectible’’ but are 
now the exact opposite. 
What kept Earth Prime afloat while all the 
other boats sank? Farrell herself seems to 
have been a major factor. Her clear vision of 
how to create communities of like-minded 
fans would serve her well, as one industry 
faltered and another emerged. 
In 1989, Farrell opened Quarterstaff Games 
directly above Earth Prime. With its medie-
val-tavern vibe, it’s Vermont’s longest-lived 
gaming shop. Like its sister store, Quarter-
staff has fostered a long-marginalized com-
munity and given them a home—another 
tribute to Farrell’s dedication. 
Farrell’s tenacity was rewarded as the cen-
tury came to a close and the fortunes of 
comics changed once again. Though super-
heroes had made their mark on cinema in 
the past, notably with Tim Burton’s Batman 
and Richard Donner’s Superman films, the 
2000s saw the rise of Marvel as an entertain-
ment business. In 20 years, the company 
went from barely surviving bankruptcy to 
being a multibillion-dollar juggernaut that 
dominates Hollywood. Disney would buy it 
in 2009. 
For Giordano, that process started at 
Earth Prime, where the future illustrator 
would draw all day at a table beside the back 
issues. 
‘‘I would never have become an artist if I 
didn’t have somewhere like Earth Prime,’’ he 
said. ‘‘People there would see me drawing, 
whether it was coworkers or customers, and 
gave me positive feedback. There’s power in 
that—I started to think, Hey, maybe I’m not 
a total piece of shit. Maybe I have some 
value. I owe everything to that experience.’’ 
TO BE CONTINUED 
I remembered Giordano’s words as I stared 
down the front door of Earth Prime a few 
weeks ago. I hadn’t been inside in years, but 
knowing that the store was there hung on 
me like a weight, like a gift I couldn’t dare 
take for granted. 
I walked inside, unsurprised by the posters 
this time. The staff were helping customers 
or reading comics as hip-hop played softly 
over the speakers. 
I thought of Shady, the black cat who used 
to guard the boxes of comics with a lazy 
swipe of her paw. I thought about how I’ve 
skipped every school reunion I’ve ever been

invited to and how none of them would have 
felt as much like an authentic reunion as 
being inside Earth Prime did at that mo-
ment. 
A man roughly my own age walked in, 
flanked by several children. One of them, a 
young girl wearing a white-and-pink Spider- 
Gwen hoodie, had a list in hand. She bounced 
on the balls of her feet as she browsed from 
shelf to shelf, humming quietly. 
I looked away, overcome by a rogue wave 
of emotion. I seemed to see a thread stretch-
ing back through time, connecting Bissette, 
Veitch and Farrell hunting the comics racks 
to misfits like Giordano and Simmon finding 
family at a fledgling shop. That thread 
reached all the way to the girl in the hoodie, 
humming to herself in her happy place. 
Earth Prime was hers now more than mine, 
and I loved that so much that I felt a 
strange, damp sensation at the comers of my 
eyes. 
As I walked away from Earth Prime, I 
made a mental note to text my brother. I 
wanted to say something reflective of the 
strange epiphany I’d had standing in the 
shop. In the end, though, I decided to keep it 
simple. 
‘‘Dropped by Earth Prime,’’ I texted Pat. 
‘‘Still the same.’’ 
(At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, the 
following statement was ordered to be

IRAN 
∑ Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, yes-
terday, the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee held a hearing examining 
the current negotiations around restor-
ing the JCPOA and our Nation’s Iran 
policy. However, because I contracted 
COVID–19 and am following CDC guid-
ance to isolate, I was not able to at-
tend this important hearing. But I do 
want to state, for the record, that I be-
lieve preventing a nuclear-armed Iran 
through hard-nosed diplomacy is of the 
utmost importance to our Nation. 
I am under no illusions that the deal 
currently being negotiated by the 
Biden administration would be perfect 
or that Iran is a good-faith negotiating 
partner. But when it comes to pre-
venting a nuclear-armed Iran and cre-
ating a monitoring and verification re-
gime that ensures Iran is sticking to 
its commitments, it is the only option. 
Maximum pressure didn’t work; more 
sanctions only led to Iran reconsti-
tuting its weapons program and grow-
ing its nuclear stockpile and more ne-
farious behavior in the region. A mili-
tary response would be even worse; 
Iran would undoubtedly retaliate and 
be incentivized to ratchet up its nu-
clear program as it has done when its 
nuclear facilities and officials have 
been attacked in the past. Neither op-
tion achieves our goal of preventing a 
nuclear-armed Iran. 
The only viable option is to continue 
negotiations on a nuclear deal. Doing 
so doesn’t mean foregoing all of our 
other concerns with Iran. The U.S. 
never should and never will acquiesce 
in Iran’s violations of international 
law and human rights and should con-
tinue to use all of our tools to combat 
its malign actions. But it would be a 
grave mistake to effectively green 
light an Iranian bomb if we are unable 
to convince Iran’s leadership to re-
nounce all of Iran’s other bad behavior 
as well. 
A nuclear-armed Iran would be cata-
strophic for the region and the world 
by emboldening a belligerent nation, 
setting off an arms race, and under-
mining the broader nuclear order. I 
urge my colleagues to join me in giving 
the administration the space and flexi-
bility it needs to restore a deal that 
prevents such an outcome.∑

MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
coming Monday is Memorial Day, the 
day we set aside to honor the more 
than 1.1 million Americans who have 
given their lives in military service to 
our Nation. 
It is a solemn day of remembrance 
and has a special resonance in my 
state. One of America’s first Memorial 
Day ceremonies occurred in Illinois. It 
was April 1866—barely a year after the 
end of America’s terrible Civil War. 
Three returning veterans from that 
great conflict were waiting for services 
to begin at a church in Carbondale 
when they saw a young woman with 
two infants approach a small, un-
marked grave in the church cemetery, 
place flowers on the grave, and kneel in 
prayer. The veterans, deeply moved, 
collected wildflowers and placed them 
at all of the veterans’ graves in the 
churchyard. They then arranged to 
host a parade of veterans to honor the 
war dead resting in the town’s ceme-
tery. 
More than 200 veterans showed up for 
that parade—one of America’s first Me-
morial Day parades. Among the march-
ers was General John Logan, a Civil 
War hero and proud son of Illinois. The 
following year, General Logan was ap-
pointed the commander in chief of the 
Grand Army of the Republic. One of his 
first acts as commander in chief was to 
call for a national day of remembrance 
to honor the soldiers who sacrificed 
their lives so that America could re-
ceive a ‘‘new birth of freedom.’’ 
In the Army’s General Order No. 11— 
the ‘‘Memorial Day Order’’—General 
Logan wrote of his hope that the day of 
remembrance would be ‘‘kept up from 
year to year, [as long as] a survivor of 
the war remains to honor the memory 
of his departed comrades.’’ 
On this Memorial Day, more than a 
century and a half later, we remember 
all of the American patriots who have 
fallen in battles—from Antietam, to 
the Argonne Forest, to Afghanistan. 
General Logan called their deaths ‘‘the 
cost of a free and undivided republic.’’ 
In these fractious times, when our 
Nation sometimes feels, again, like a 
house divided, may we remember the 
price those fallen heroes paid to pre-
serve our Union. And may we also re-
member the duty we each bear to pre-
serve the priceless gift for which they 
gave their lives—this Nation, free and 
undivided. 
On a related note, I want to take a 
moment to wish a belated happy birth-
day to an American hero who returned 
from war. Sgt. Victor Butler is that 
last surviving Tuskegee Airman in his 
home State of Rhode Island and one of 
the last of that legendary Band of 
Brothers in our Nation. Last Saturday, 
May 21, Mr. Butler celebrated his 100th 
birthday. 
When he was a young man, he and 
the other members of the Tuskegee 
Airmen helped to save the world from 
the tyranny of fascism—and he helped 
to loosen the grip of racism on Amer-
ica. In the weeks before his 100th birth-
day, Mr. Butler told family and friends 
all he wanted for his centennial cele-
bration was a card. He didn’t want 
folks to make a fuss or go to any great 
expense. 
One of his nieces posted his wish on 
social media—and word spread. He 
thought he might receive a few cards. 
At last count, Mr. Butler had received 
more than 40,000 cards and video greet-
ings from people in every State in the 
Union and as far away as Japan, South 
Korea, and Germany. 
Last Saturday, on his birthday, his 
hometown held a parade in his honor. 
And he received a signed football and a 
jersey with the number ‘‘100’’ on the 
back, hand-delivered by the owner of 
his favorite football team, the New 
England Patriots—a well-deserved trib-
ute to a real-life hero. 
Like the tradition of Memorial Day, 
the Tuskegee Airmen have a special 
connection to my State. The first air-
field 
where 
they 
trained—before 
Tuskegee—was 
Chanute 
Field 
in 
Rantoul, IL, near Champaign. The spot 
where that airfield stood is marked 
proudly today with signs that read 
‘‘Birthplace of the Tuskegee Airmen.’’ 
And in 2016, Illinois renamed a stretch 
of Interstate 57 on the South Side of 
Chicago as the Tuskegee Airmen Me-
morial Trail. It is a fitting tribute, 
given how many Tuskegee Airman had 
roots in the Chicago area. 
African-Americans have fought and 
died 
for 
America’s 
freedom 
since 
Crispus 
Attucks 
became 
the 
first 
American to fall in our War for Inde-
pendence. 
As the first African-American avi-
ators ever to serve in the U.S. Army 
Air Corps, the Tuskegee Airman oc-
cupy a special chapter in our Nation’s 
history. They fought in World War II, 
at a time when the U.S. Armed Forces 
were still segregated, and our Nation 
was still riven with racially discrimi-
natory laws and attitudes. Their origi-
nal mission was to serve as escort pi-
lots for other American flyers, to pro-
tect 
them 
from 
enemy 
fire. 
The 
Tuskegee Airmen also flew bombing 
missions themselves. 
Officially, they were known as the 
99th Pursuit Squadron and the 332nd 
Fighter Group. But the pilots whose 
flights they protected gave them a 
nickname. They called them the Red 
Tails, or the Red-Tailed Angels, due to 
the distinctive color on their aircraft

wings. Their leader was the legendary 
Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., who 
would go on to become the first Afri-
can-American brigadier general in the 
U.S. Air Force. His father, Benjamin O. 
Davis, Sr., was the first Black briga-
dier general in the U.S. Army. 
There were a total of 932 Tuskegee 
Airmen 
pilots, 
and 
another 
10,000 
Tuskegee 
Airmen—and 
women—who 
served as mechanics, radio operators, 
and other essential support positions. 
They conducted more than 700 bomber 
escort missions—and they never lost a 
single lost a single aircraft—not one. 
They were the only fighter group in 
World War II with a perfect record of 
protecting bombers. 
White U.S. military pilots were per-
mitted to fly no more than 52 missions 
during World War II. Some Tuskegee 
Airman flew as many as 100 missions. 
Sixty-six Tuskegee Airmen died in 
combat. Thirty-three were held as pris-
oners of war. 
In March 2007, the Tuskegee Airmen 
as a group were awarded the Congres-
sional Gold Medal, the highest honor 
Congress can bestow. The ceremony 
was held in the Rotunda of the Capitol. 
I will never forget the sight of 300 
Tuskegee Airman dressed in red sports 
jackets, saluting the American flag in 
that hallowed space. Some were in 
wheelchairs. But when the National 
Anthem played, they all rose to their 
feet and stood straight and proud. 
Just before the Congressional Gold 
Medal ceremony, I had the privilege of 
hosting several Tuskegee Airmen with 
Illinois roots in my office. Then-Sen-
ator Obama stopped by to pay his re-
spects. It was a historic and humbling 
moment. 
I met Lt. Colonel George Sherman, 
who grew up in Moline and joined the 
Army Air Corps in 1944 at the age of 18. 
He had to take the physical twice; he 
was rejected the first time because of 
his buck teeth, but he didn’t give up. 
He ended up serving 22 years in the Air 
Force. 
First Lieutenant Shelby Westbook 
was born in Arkansas and lost both of 
his parents when he was just 12. He 
flew 60 missions over 12 countries in 
Europe. After the war, he wanted to at-
tend engineering school. The first 
school he applied to rejected him be-
cause it didn’t accept Black students. 
He moved to Chicago, earned a degree, 
and worked as an electrical engineer 
for decades. 
First Lieutenant Robert Martin fa-
mously claimed to have flown ‘‘63 and 
a half missions.’’ On his 64th combat 
mission, he was shot down over Yugo-
slavia. He was hidden by antifascist 
partisans until he could return to his 
unit. After the war, he worked as an 
electrical engineer for the city of Chi-
cago for nearly 40 years. 
Flight Officer John Lyle—‘‘Captain 
Jack’’ to his friends—grew up on Chi-
cago’s South Side. He flew 26 combat 
missions. After the war, he earned a 
college degree but couldn’t find work 
in his field so, for a time, he washed 
windows 
of 
downtown 
skyscrapers. 
Eventually, he owned his own insur-
ance agency, a fish and chicken res-
taurant, and a tree-trimming service. 
Lt. Bev Dunjill flew more than 100 
combat missions between World War II 
and the Korean war. He later worked 
for the Illinois Department of Human 
Rights. 
All of those heroes are gone now. But 
their valor and impact are not forgot-
ten. The Tuskegee Airmen and the all- 
Black Montfort Point Marines were 
among nearly 1 million Black Ameri-
cans who served in World War II. Most 
saw the war as a battle on two fronts— 
one against fascism overseas and the 
other against racially discriminatory 
laws and attitudes in America. 
Their goal, they said, was ‘‘the Dou-
ble V,’’ victory for democracy overseas 
and at home. The change at home did 
not come easily, but it did come. Three 
years after World War II ended, Presi-
dent Truman ordered an end to seg-
regation in the U.S. Armed Forces. And 
the 
service 
and 
sacrifice 
of 
the 
Tuskegee Airmen and other Black vet-
erans and leaders helped set the stage 
for the civil rights movement of the 
1950s, 60s, and 70s. 
Today, 
as 
the 
last 
surviving 
Tuskegee Airman near their 100th 
birthdays and we lose hundreds of 
World War II veterans each day, we are 
painfully aware that the democracy 
and unity they paid such a high price 
for is under threat, both overseas and 
at home. The peace of Europe and de-
mocracy itself is under fire from Rus-
sia in Ukraine. And our sense of secu-
rity and national unity seems to be 
fraying at home. Violence—especially 
gun violence—threatens us all, even 
our children. 
Our progress against division and dis-
crimination often feels shaky. We are 
pitted against each other by those who 
believe that conflict and anger is good 
for their political interests or their 
profit sheets. But it doesn’t have to be 
this way. 
As we prepare to remember and 
honor those who gave their lives for 
our freedom, let us resolve to do our 
part, in our time, to keep our Nation 
free and undivided.

HONORING TED BENDA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
April, I came to the floor to honor fall-
en Iowa State Patrol Sergeant Jim 
Smith, who was murdered trying to ap-
prehend a violent criminal. Last week, 
justice was served. His killer was con-
victed. I thank everyone who worked 
on this case. 
Today, after the completion of Na-
tional Police Week, it is with a heavy 
heart that I recognize another Iowa 
State Patrol officer killed in the line of 
duty last year in a tragic car accident. 
State Patrol Trooper Ted Benda was a 
dedicated servant of the people of Iowa 
for 16 years. 
He began his career in Marquette and 
later moved to the Iowa State Patrol 
to serve the communities of Mason 
City and Oelwein. Trooper Benda was 
beloved by his colleagues who de-
scribed him as dedicated. He ‘‘fully em-
braced the call to protect the commu-
nity.’’ 
He put his family first, always lent a 
hand to friends and neighbors and cher-
ished both his country and his commu-
nity. Even in death, his service contin-
ued. As an organ donor, Trooper Benda 
continued to save lives. Trooper Benda: 
We thank you. 
Trooper Benda left behind a loving 
family including his wife, Holly, and 
his four young daughters: Madilyn, 
Avery, Vivyan, and Sylvia. 
Let me say to them: Your immeas-
urable sacrifice is honored by your 
community and your country. We 
thank you. 
Losses like Trooper Benda’s remind 
us of the great dangers that law en-
forcement officers and first responders 
face in service to our communities. 
Last week, the Judiciary Committee 
held a Police Week markup. We passed 
several important measures through 
our committee that will help the po-
lice. 
Soon, at my request, the Judiciary 
Committee will have a hearing on at-
tacks on police. I have and will con-
tinue to lead efforts in the Senate to 
support law enforcement. After all that 
they have done to protect and serve us, 
it is the least I can do to protect and 
serve them.

NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 
1988, President Ronald Reagan first 
recognized May as National Foster 
Care Month. 
Each year since then, the month of 
May has been recognized as a time to 
bring awareness to youth in foster 
care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2742 
May 26, 2022 
I thank my colleagues for once again 
unanimously passing a resolution to 
recognize the experiences of youth and 
families in the foster care system and 
celebrate those who work to improve 
their lives. 
Organizations in Iowa and around the 
country tirelessly serve kids and fami-
lies in foster care and the foster par-
ents who open their homes to kids in 
need. 
I salute these organizations and indi-
viduals for their year-round efforts to 
support the kids most in need. 
In 2020, there were over 400,000 kids in 
foster care, including over 4,000 kids in 
Iowa. 
During the pandemic, there was a 
drop in reports of child abuse, as well 
as entries into foster care and exits 
from foster care. 
There were the fewest adoptions from 
foster care since 2016 with 8,000 fewer 
children being adopted compared to the 
previous year. 
However, Iowa deserves recognition 
for being one of only nine States to in-
crease adoptions from foster care dur-
ing 2020. 
Permanency for youth in foster care 
is so important, and I am glad that 
Iowa continued to make this a priority 
during the pandemic. 
Older youth in foster care and adults 
who experienced foster care as a child 
can speak to what worked for them and 
what didn’t work. 
These young adults should always 
have a seat at the table. 
When I founded the Senate Caucus on 
Foster Youth in 2009, the special focus 
was to hear directly from youth them-
selves. 
Over and over again, I have heard the 
same thing from kids in foster care: 
They want a mom and dad. They want 
a family and a place to call home. 
All children, no matter their cir-
cumstances, deserve a permanent, lov-
ing home and consistent, caring adults 
in their lives. 
We know that just having one caring 
and consistent adult can meaningfully 
improve the lives of kids in the long- 
term. 
For some kids, this can be a biologi-
cal parent who receives the support 
they need to safely care for their child. 
For others, a foster parent, mentor 
or court-appointed special advocate 
can be that adult. 
My resolution marks May 31 as a par-
ticular day to recognize and show ap-
preciation for foster parents. 
Congress has worked to expand ac-
cess to prevention services in the hopes 
of keeping families out of foster care in 
the first place. 
But in addition to this, it is crucial 
for foster parents to get the support 
they need to continue serving kids in 
their communities. 
In Iowa, almost every county has a 
shortage of trained foster parents who 
are able to provide a temporary home 
for kids. 
Without volunteer foster parents, 
kids who cannot remain safely at home 
end up sleeping in hotels and in the of-
fices of social workers. 
Moving forward, Congress must con-
tinue to work to find better solutions 
and secure better outcomes for youth 
in foster care. 
It is clear that there is no one answer 
for kids in foster care. Some can be re-
unified with their families; others are 
best cared for by adoptive parents or a 
kinship caregiver. 
But the goal should always be the 
same: to protect kids from neglect and 
abuse and provide them with love and 
support. 
I thank my colleagues for unani-
mously passing my resolution honoring 
May as National Foster Care Month 
once again and look forward to con-
tinuing to work on this issue.

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL GENTRY W. 
BOSWELL 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today, I 
am honored to recognize the extraor-
dinary service of Brig. Gen. Gentry W. 
Boswell on the occasion of his retire-
ment. His 31 years of service to our Na-
tion is the reflection of a true and de-
voted public servant. 
General Boswell received his commis-
sion in 1991 as a distinguished graduate 
of the Air Force Reserve Officer Train-
ing Corps at Delta State University, 
and he also earned a master of aero-
nautical science at Embry-Riddle Aero-
nautical University. In addition, Gen-
eral Boswell studied at the Squadron 
Officer School, the Air Command and 
Staff College, the Joint Forces Com-
mand Advanced Warfighting School, 
the Air War College, the Keenan- 
Flagler Enterprise Leadership School, 
and the Naval War College. General 
Boswell’s distinguished military career 
encompassed operational tours flying 
the B–1B, B–52, RC–135, and E–6B air-
craft, and he accumulated more than 
4,900 flight hours, including over 500 
combat hours in Southwest Asia, the 
Balkans, and the Horn of Africa. 
South Dakotans were fortunate to 
have General Boswell fulfill five sepa-
rate military assignments at Ellsworth 
Air Force Base, serving as assistant di-
rector of operations for the 77th Bomb 
Squadron from 1999 to 2002, director of 
operations for the 37th Bomb Squadron 
from 2007 to 2008, commander of the 
28th 
Operations 
Support 
Squadron 
from 2008 to 2010, vice commander of 
the 28th Bomb Wing from 2012 to 2014, 
and commander of the 28th Bomb Wing 
from 2015 to 2017. 
During his assignments at Ellsworth 
AFB, General Boswell developed a cul-
ture of putting the airmen first, and he 
engaged actively in partnerships with 
civilian leadership in Rapid City and 
other Black Hills communities to im-
prove the quality of life for those in 
uniform and their families. In addition, 
as commander of the 28th Operations 
Support Squadron, General Boswell 
was instrumental in advancing the ex-
pansion of the Powder River Training 
Complex. The expanded air space rep-
resents the largest military operations 
area in the lower 48 States, spanning 
the skies over North Dakota and South 
Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. This 
expansive training airspace allows Air 
Force pilots and crews to perform the 
critical training they need in condi-
tions that closely resemble combat 
missions. 
General Boswell’s final assignment 
for the Air Force was serving as the di-
rector of manpower, organization, and 
resources. He led the management and 
oversight of the Air Force’s manpower 
enterprise, which encompasses more 
than 694,000 total force personnel and 
the programming of more than $47 bil-
lion in annual funding. 
General Boswell has received several 
prestigious awards for his outstanding 
military service, including the Defense 
Superior Service Medal, Legion of 
Merit with two oakleaf clusters, De-
fense Meritorious Service Medal, Meri-
torious 
Service 
Medal 
with 
three 
oakleaf clusters, and the Air Medal 
with two oakleaf clusters. 
We are thrilled that General Boswell 
has chosen to retire in the Black Hills 
of South Dakota, where he will have 
plenty of opportunities to dedicate 
more time to hunting. I join all South 
Dakotans in extending our congratula-
tions to General Boswell upon his re-
tirement and for his outstanding mili-
tary career.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Australia—HIMARS Launchers 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested to buy twenty (20) M142 High Mobil-
ity Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 
thirty (30) M30A2 Guided Multiple Launch 
Rocket Systems (GMLRS); thirty (30) Alter-
native Warhead (AW) Pods with Insensitive 
Munitions Propulsion Systems (IMPS); thir-
ty (30) M31A2 GMLRS Unitary (GMLRS–U) 
High Explosive Pods with IMPS; thirty (30) 
XM403 Extended Range (ER)–GMLRS AW 
Pods; thirty (30) EM404 ER GMLRS Unitary 
Pods; and ten (10) M57 Army Tactical Missile 
System (ATACMS). Also included are Re-
duced Range Practice Rocket Pods (RRPRP); 
Vehicular Intercom System (AN/VIC–3) 3– 
Station; radio communication mounts; ma-
chine gun mounts; battle management sys-
tem vehicle integration kits; wheel guards; 
ruggedized laptops; training equipment pub-
lications; spare and repair parts; support 
equipment; tools; test equipment; technical 
data; U.S. Government and Contractor sup-
port; technical and logistical support serv-
ices; and other related elements of program 
and logistic support. The total estimated 
program cost is $385 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale will improve Australia’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats, and will enhance interoperability 
with U.S. forces and other allied forces. Aus-
tralia will use the capability to strengthen 
its homeland defense and provide greater se-
curity for its critical infrastructure. Aus-
tralia will have no difficulty absorbing this 
equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be Lockheed 
Martin Inc., Bethesda, MD; Chelton Inc., 
Marlow, United Kingdom; and L3 Harris 
Corp., Melbourne, FL. The purchaser typi-
cally requests offsets. Any offset agreement 
will be defined in negotiations between the 
purchaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of two (2) U.S. Gov-
ernment and five (5) U.S. contractor rep-
resentatives in Australia for a period of one 
year. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–28 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket 
System (HIMARS) is a C–130 transportable 
wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton Family 
of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. 
HIMARS is the modern Army-fielded version 
of the Multiple Launch Rocket System 
(MLRS) M270 launcher, and can fire all of the 
MLRS Family of Munitions (FOM) including 
Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System 
(GMLRS) variants and the Army Tactical 
Missile System (ATACMS). Utilizing the 
MLRS FOM, the HIMARS can engage targets 
between 15 and 300 kilometers with Global 
Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision 
accuracy. 
2. The M31A2 GMLRS Unitary is the 
Army’s primary munition for units fielding 
the 
M142 
HIMARS 
and 
M270Al 
MLRS 
Launchers. The M31 Unitary is a solid pro-
pellant artillery rocket that uses GPS/Pre-
cise Positioning Service (PPS)-aided inertial 
guidance to accurately and quickly deliver a 
single high-explosive blast fragmentation 
warhead to targets at ranges from 15–70 kilo-
meters. The rockets are fired from a launch 
pod container that also serves as the storage 
and transportation container for the rockets. 
Each rocket pod holds six (6) total rockets. 
3. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead 
shares a greater than 90% commonality with 
the M31A1 Unitary. The primary difference 
between the GMLRS-U and GMLRS-AW is 
the replacement of the Unitary’s high explo-
sive warhead with a 200-pound fragmentation 
warhead of pre-formed tungsten penetrators 
which is optimized for effectiveness against 
large area and imprecisely located targets. 
The munitions otherwise share a common 
motor, GPS/PPS-aided inertial guidance and 
control system, fusing mechanism, multi-op-
tion height of burst capability, and effective 
range of 15–70km. 
4. The M57 ATACMS-Unitary is a conven-
tional, semi-ballistic missile that utilizes a 
500-pound high explosive warhead. It has an 
effective range of between 70 and 300 kilo-
meters, and has increased lethality and accu-
racy over previous versions of the ATACMS 
due to a GPS/ PPS aided navigation system. 
5. The Extended Range (ER) GMLRS pro-
vides a persistent, responsive, all-weather, 
rapidly deployed, long range, surface-to sur-
face, area- and point-precision strike capa-
bility. The XM403 Alternative Warhead (AW) 
carries a 200-pound fragmentation assembly 
filled with high explosives which, upon deto-
nation, accelerates two layers of preformed 
penetrators 
optimized 
for 
effectiveness 
against large area and imprecisely located 
targets. The XM404 Unitary variant is a 200– 
pound class unitary with a steel blast-frag-
mentation case, designed for low collateral 
damage against point targets. The ER 
GMLRS maintains the accuracy and effec-
tiveness 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
baseline 
GMLRS out to a maximum range of 150 km 
while also including a new Height of Burst 
(HOB) capability. 
6. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
7. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
8. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
9. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Aus-
tralia.

Funding Source: Foreign Military Financ-
ing (FMF) 
(iii) Description: On February 16, 2021, Con-
gress was notified by Congressional certifi-
cation transmittal number 20–81 of the pos-
sible sale, under Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms 
Export Control Act, of up to one hundred

of this MDE represents an increase in capa-
bility over what was previously notified. The 
Egyptian Navy will replace the RAM MK 49 
MOD 3 launchers on its Ex-Oliver Hazard 
Perry (OHP) Frigates with these Mod 5 
launchers. This potential sale will improve 
Egypt’s capability to meet current and fu-
ture threats and provide significantly en-
hanced area defense capabilities over Egypt’s 
coastal areas and approaches to the Suez 
Canal. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-

ing to improve the security of a Major Non- 
NATO Ally that continues to be an impor-
tant strategic partner in the Middle East. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The RAM 
MK 49 GMLS is the launcher for the RAM 
Guided Missile Weapon System (GMWS) that 
was approved under the original 36(b)(l) noti-
fication, Transmittal No. 20–81. The RAM 
GMWS is a high fire power, dual mode, fire 
and forget weapon system, which provides 
ship self defense against anti-ship missiles. 
The RAM MK 49 GMLS is comprised of a 21- 
round launcher guide, which is capable of fir-
ing tactical or telemetry RAM missiles. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is UNCLASSI-
FIED.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
The Netherlands—AIM–9X Block II Missiles 
The Government of the Netherlands has re-
quested to buy seventy-two (72) AIM–9X 
Block II Tactical Missiles; and forty-three 
(43) AIM–9X Block II+ Tactical Missiles that 
will be added to a previously implemented 
case. The original FMS case, valued at $16.8 
million, included twenty-three (23) AIM–9X 
Block II Tactical Missiles. The Netherlands 
has also requested a new FMS case for twen-
ty-two (22) AIM–9X Block II Tactical Mis-
siles; forty-three (43) AIM–9X Block II+ Tac-
tical Missiles; and one (1) AIM–9X Block II+ 
Tactical Guidance Unit. Therefore, this noti-
fication is for a total of ninety-five (95) AIM– 
9X Block II Tactical Missiles; forty-three (43) 
AIM–9X Block II+ Tactical Missiles; and one 
(1) AIM–9X Block II+ Tactical Guidance 
Unit. Also included are containers; classified 
and unclassified software; U.S. Government 
and contractor technical assistance; and 
other related elements of logistical and pro-
gram support. The total estimated cost is 
$117 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
security of a NATO ally that is an important 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in Europe. 
The proposed sale will enable the Royal 
Netherlands Air Force (RNAF) to provide 
stronger support for the Netherlands’ air de-
fense needs. This proposed sale of AIM–9X 
missiles will improve the RNAF’s capability 
to conduct self-defense and regional security 
missions, enhancing interoperability with 
the U.S. and other NATO members. The 
Netherlands will have no difficulty absorbing 
these missiles into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.

UKRAINE 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, today, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the Joint Resolution Ex-
pressing Support For The People Of 
Ukraine which was passed overwhelm-
ingly by the Maine State Legislature. 
Together, we recognize the importance 
of democratic institutions and values 
around the world, and we are resolute 
in 
fighting 
against 
the 
forces 
of 
authoritarianism. This joint resolution 
reiterates Maine people’s support for 
peace, diplomacy, and the immediate 
end to the invasion. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATE OF MAINE 
IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD TWO THOUSAND 
TWENTY-TWO 
JOINT RESOLUTION EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR 
THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE 
Whereas, Ukraine is the second largest 
country in Europe; and 
Whereas, on January 21, 1990, more than 
300,000 Ukrainians called for unity and inde-
pendence from the Soviet Union by forming 
a human chain between the cities of Kyiv 
and Ivano-Frankivsk; and 
Whereas, after years of oppression, in 1991 
Ukraine won 
freedom 
from 
the 
Soviet 
Union’s totalitarian dictatorship because of 
the Ukrainians’ love of liberty; and 
Whereas, Ukraine is a sovereign nation, 
and the United States and Ukraine have been 
partners since Ukraine declared its inde-
pendence from the Soviet Union more than 
30 years ago; and 
Whereas, the people of Maine and the peo-
ple of Ukraine share a commitment to de-
mocracy, human rights and the rule of law; 
and 
Whereas, Ukrainians and Ukrainian Ameri-
cans have enriched our communities through 
their leadership and contributions in agri-
culture, business, academia, government and 
the arts; and 
Whereas, on December 5, 1994, in an effort 
to solidify security commitments to Ukraine 
in return for its nuclear disarmament, the 
United States, the Russian Federation and 
the United Kingdom signed the Budapest 
Memorandum 
on 
Security 
Assurances, 
whereby each country pledged to respect the 
independence and sovereignty of Ukraine’s 
borders while refraining from the threat or 
use of force against Ukraine; and 
Whereas, over the past 3 decades, the Rus-
sian Federation has illegally seized Ukrain-
ian land in Crimea; armed Russian-backed 
separatists, leading to thousands of deaths; 
interfered in elections; used chemical weap-
ons to attempt assassinations; carried out 
cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns 
abroad; and violated international arms con-
trol agreements; and 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russian 
President Vladimir Putin abandoned diplo-
macy and international pleas for peace and 
launched an unprovoked military invasion of 
Ukraine; and 
Whereas, this attack on Ukraine has al-
ready killed thousands of Ukrainian service 
members and civilians and caused an urgent 
international humanitarian crisis; and 
Whereas, President Putin has denied the 
existence of Ukraine and seeks to overthrow 
the democratically elected government of 
Ukraine; and 
Whereas, the Russian Federation has fla-
grantly violated international law in at-
tempting to unilaterally create 2 new so- 
called republics on sovereign Ukrainian ter-
ritory; and 
Whereas, lasting peace and prosperity re-
quire respect for the sovereignty and terri-
torial integrity of countries and respect for 
human rights; and 
Whereas, the people of Ukraine are now en-
gaged in an armed conflict to defend their 
independence and democratic way of life; 
now, therefore, be it 
Resolved: That We, the Members of the One 
Hundred and Thirtieth Legislature now as-
sembled in the Second Regular Session, on 
behalf of the people we represent, take this 
opportunity to recognize the democratic val-
ues shared by the people of Maine and the 
people of Ukraine; and be it further 
Resolved: That the State of Maine stands in 
solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they 
fight for their freedom; and be it further 
Resolved: That the State of Maine con-
demns the unprovoked Russian invasion of 
Ukraine and reiterates its support for peace, 
diplomacy and an immediate end to the in-
vasion; and be it further 
Resolved: That the State of Maine recog-
nizes the importance of and commends the 
steps the United States has taken so far to 
punish the Russian government for its ac-
tions and to offer humanitarian relief to the 
Ukrainian people; and be it further 
Resolved: That the State of Maine encour-
ages our citizens to support Ukrainian Amer-
icans and the people of Ukraine in their ur-
gent time of need; and be it further 
Resolved: That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary 
of State, be transmitted to the Honorable 
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United 
States, and each Member of the Maine Con-

TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL CHASE 
DAVID PATRICK 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today, I 
honor a superb leader, liaison and war-
rior. After 2 years of service as Direc-
tor of the Navy Senate Liaison Office, 
Chase Patrick is deservedly moving on 
and assuming the responsibilities of a 
rear admiral, lower half. I believe it is 
fitting to recognize Admiral Patrick’s 
distinguished service and dedication to 
fostering the relationship between the 
U.S. Navy and the Senate. 
While I was just starting my time in 
the Senate in 1994, Admiral Patrick 
was graduating from the University of 
Virginia that same year. He showed his 
value quickly upon joining the Navy 
and has been consistently relied upon 
for his exceptional leadership and un-
paralleled work ethic. A surface war-
fare officer by designation, Admiral 
Patrick has led our Nation’s young 
men and women on shore and at sea, 
most prominently in command of USS 
Chafee (DDG–90), where the Navy se-
lected him to receive the Vice Admiral 
Stockdale 
Award 
for 
Inspirational 
Leadership and Commander Destroyer 
Squadron 50 and Task Force 55. 
Admiral Patrick has excelled in nu-
merous other leadership positions in 
the Navy, most recently as the director 
of the Navy Senate Liaison. In Wash-
ington, DC, and around the globe, Ad-
miral Patrick filled the role that was 
initially created and held by the late 
Senator John McCain after his return 
from Vietnam as a Navy Captain. Dec-
ades later, Admiral Patrick had the job 
of leading the Navy Senate Liaison Of-
fice through the COVID–19 pandemic, 
relentlessly coordinating congressional 
delegations for our Members and our 
staffs during the most troubling of 
times and ensuring continuity between 
this Chamber and the U.S. Navy. 
Over the course of the last few years, 
Admiral Patrick led six congressional 
delegations to 10 different countries. 
He escorted over half of the Members of 
this Chamber on travel and became a 
trusted adviser and friend to many of 
us. I have had the pleasure of traveling 
with Admiral Patrick on several trips, 
including his first trip as director of 
the Navy Senate Liaison Office. He dis-
tinguished himself by going above and 
beyond the call of duty to facilitate 
and successfully execute each and 
every congressional delegation, despite 
any number of weather, aircraft, and 
diplomatic challenges. 
This month, Admiral Patrick departs 
Washington for Naples, Italy, to serve 
as the director of Maritime Head-
quarters, U.S. Naval Forces Europe, Af-
rica and Sixth Fleet. This Chamber 
will feel Admiral Patrick’s absence. I 
join many past and present Members of 
Congress in my gratitude and apprecia-
tion to Admiral Patrick for his out-
standing leadership and unwavering 
support of the missions of the U.S. 
Navy. I especially recognize his patient 
and supportive family, his wife Mrs. 
Paurenia Patrick and his children, 
Sara, Chase, Jr., Harry, and Oliver. I 
wish this Navy family ‘‘fair winds and 
following seas.’’ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LEE J. LOFTHUS 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express my appreciation for a 
dedicated public servant, Mr. LEE J. 
Lofthus of Maryland, who is retiring 
after nearly 40 years of public service 
at the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Lee received his MBA from American 
University in 1982 and joined the De-
partment 
shortly 
thereafter. 
Since 
then, he has served in a number of posi-
tions, including the last 16 years as its 
Assistant Attorney General for Admin-
istration, the highest ranking career 
position at the Department of Justice. 
In this role, he has been responsible for 
many duties, including serving as the 
Department’s chief financial officer, 
leading its financial reporting, annual 
financial statement, budget formula-
tion and execution, accounting oper-
ations, asset forfeiture fund support 
and debt management support. As As-
sistant Attorney General, he has also 
been the Department’s chief ethics offi-
cial while also overseeing its facilities, 
procurement, human resources, and 
planning. Lee also served as the De-
partment of Justice career Agency 
Transition Director for every Presi-
dential transition since 2008. His lead-
ership has been essential to the Depart-
ment’s operations. 
I know Lee from his role as the top 
Department of Justice liaison with the 
House and Senate Appropriations Com-
mittees. In my time as both chairman 
and ranking member of the Senate 
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee, I have 
seen firsthand Lee’s deft understanding 
and management of the congressional 
appropriations process. He has been an 
asset to both the Department and the 
Appropriations Committees and will be 
missed by all of those who have worked 
with and for him. 
Lee has many interests outside of his 
work, and he will now have the oppor-
tunity to focus more time on those in-
terests, foremost among those his wife 
Dawn and his sons Mike and Austin. I 
also expect Lee will dedicate more 
time to caring for animals, including 
his affinity for dachshunds and his oc-
casional adoption of a wayward bird. 
Lee may even find some time to in-

The one activity to which I am cer-

Bank Notes, which were effectively a 
form of national currency until being 
discontinued in the 1930s. The ledgers 
Lee is familiar with are not just the 
ones involved in the Department’s 
budgeting, but also the original Treas-
ury Department ledgers tracing the re-
turn and destruction of these notes. I 
wish Lee continued success in this 
field. 
Above all else, Lee will leave behind 
a legacy of strong, calm, and effective 
leadership. Few can fill the multi-
faceted role he held at the Department 
but even fewer can do so in the univer-
sally respected and admired manner 
that he did so. 
The Nation and the Department of 
Justice have lost a great asset. I com-
mend Lee for his many accomplish-
ments and for his selfless service to 
this country. He will be missed. On be-
half of Kansans and a grateful nation, 
I personally thank Lee for his service 
to our Nation and congratulate him on 
his retirement; he has earned a long 
and fulfilling one.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DONALD ROSS 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Donald K. Ross, a tireless or-
ganizer for democracy. Sadly, Mr. Ross 
passed away on May 14, 2022, at the age 
of 78. He will be remembered for his 
lifetime of civic service and advocacy. 
Born in the Bronx, NY, Mr. Ross was 
a leader from an early age. As student 
body president, he successfully revived 
Fordham 
University’s 
football 
pro-
gram, an experience he credited with 
teaching him how to organize. Upon 
graduation, Mr. Ross spent 2 years with 
the Peace Corps in Nigeria, before 
graduating from New York Univer-
sity’s law school in 1970. 
From there, Mr. Ross joined con-
sumer advocate Ralph Nader’s Public 
Citizen movement, becoming one of the 
original ‘‘Nader’s Raiders.’’ In 1971, 
they co-wrote ‘‘Action for Change: A 
Student’s Manual for Public Interest 
Organizing,’’ which led to the organiza-
tion 
of 
Public 
Interest 
Research 
Groups—PRIGs—across 
the 
country. 
These organizations combine research 
and public action, encouraging public 
citizens to get involved in important 
advocacy issues. Mr. Ross became the 
director of the New York PRIG, where 
he advanced a number of political re-
forms and advocated for increased gov-
ernment transparency. 
Mr. Ross was also an outspoken anti- 
nuclear advocate. After the tragic acci-
dent at the Three Mile Island nuclear 
power plant in Pennsylvania, Mr. Ross 
organized 
anti-nuclear 
rallies 
that 
drew hundreds of thousands of dem-
onstrators. That he was able to mobi-
lize so many people in mere weeks 
after the accident is a testament to his 
leadership skills and passion for the 
cause. 
In addition to his organizing exper-
tise, Mr. Ross was also a dedicated phi-
lanthropist. From 1985 to 1999, he was 
director of the Rockefeller Family 
Fund, a charitable organization where 
he worked to expand access to grants 
for charitable causes. Additionally, Mr. 
Ross cofounded and managed the Envi-
ronmental Grantmakers Association, 
which has grown to include over 200 
member foundations around the world. 
A champion of numerous causes, Mr. 
Ross directed the National Campaign 
to Reform Juvenile Justice Systems 
from 2009 to 2017. 
In my home State, Mr. Ross orga-
nized the Connecticut Citizen Action 
Group, a statewide organization dedi-
cated to actively engaging residents to 
build a more sustainable, just society. 
In this and every endeavor he under-
took in his remarkable career, Mr. 
Ross was on the frontlines of democ-
racy, fighting to make our world a bet-
ter place. 
Connecticut and the Nation have lost 
a great civic organizer and champion of 
democracy. Mr. Ross’s tireless devotion 
to many worthy causes—from environ-
mental protection, to consumer advo-
cacy, to criminal justice reform, and so 
many others—serves as a model of 
dedication 
and 
civic 
engagement. 
Through his work and his writings, Mr. 
Ross has inspired a generation of citi-
zens to become engaged in their com-
munities and fight for a more just 
world. While he will be sorely missed, 
his legacy will live on in those who 
continue his work. 
My wife Cynthia and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Donald’s family 
during this difficult time, particularly 
to his wife Helen, and his children 
Katherine, Margaret, and Mike. May 
their many wonderful memories of 
Donald provide them solace and com-
fort in the days ahead. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in remembering 
Donald K. Ross.∑

RECOGNIZING DADS ON DUTY 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize a group of com-
mitted Louisiana fathers making a dif-
ference in their community and the 
lives of their children. 
Violence 
within 
the 
halls 
of 
Southwood High School in Shreveport 
reached a concerning peak in the fall of 
2021, when 23 students were arrested in 
just 3 days. 
Mr. Michael LaFitte gathered 40 fel-
low concerned fathers, including David 
Telsee, III, Michael Morgan, Zachery 
Johnson, and Kenneth Henry, Jr., and 
established a wholesome presence in 
the halls of Southwood High. They 
were able to quell conflict and vio-
lence. They are promoting peace, order, 
and dropping dad jokes with a profound 
impact. They have prevented fights and 
arrests since forming their group, Dads 
on Duty. By fostering a safer environ-
ment in Southwood High, Dads on Duty 
has allowed the youth to focus on 
learning and growing. 
Dads on Duty is demonstrating a 
strategy they believe can benefit stu-
dents in other schools. They have plans 
to introduce this program of engaged 
parents in each Caddo Parish school 
campus moving forward. 
Dads on Duty has garnered attention 
at the city, parish, State, and national 
levels—and rightfully so. I applaud 
their efforts and look forward to seeing 
how they can continue to better our 
communities.∑

REMEMBERING BRIAN DENNIS 
BALBUENA

rise today to pay tribute to the re-
markable 
life 
of 
Brian 
Dennis 
Balbuena, a devoted son, brother, and 
friend who passed away on April 3, 2022, 
after a hard-fought battle with brain 
cancer. 
Born March 14, 1983, Brian used his 
time on earth to bring joy and light 
into the hearts of others. Having bat-
tled and beat cancer at the age of 5, 
Brian enjoyed finding new ways to 
‘‘Pay it Forward’’ to those around him. 
Brian will be remembered by his family 
and friends as a loving and compas-
sionate person who had a contagious 
smile and a presence that brightened 
any room he entered. 
He leaves behind his incredible par-
ents, Tina and Mark, his siblings, 
Amber and Dustin, and a host of nieces 
and nephews. May his legacy and kind 
spirit serve as an inspiration to us all.∑

REMEMBERING COLONEL LOUIS 
‘‘LOU’’ LEE MYERS, JR. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the re-
markable life of retired Colonel Louis 
(Lou) Lee Myers, Jr., a 38-year veteran 
of the Illinois Army National Guard 
who passed away on May 10, 2022. 
Colonel Myers started his career in 
1948 when he joined the Illinois Army 
National Guard, first serving in an ord-
nance company and later in a field ar-
tillery unit, a part of the Illinois’ 44th 
Infantry Division. In 1970, Colonel 
Myers moved to Springfield to work for 
the Military and Naval Department, 
Facilities Division. During this time, 
Colonel Myers began a program to re-
habilitate the old armories and facili-
ties of the State and shortly after be-
came the chief of facilities before ris-
ing to the rank of lieutenant colonel. 
He attended the Command and General 
Staff School and was promoted to colo-
nel, Chief of Staff of the Illinois Army 
National Guard. 
After his retirement in 1986, Colonel 
Myers continued to serve those around 
him as a life member of the Reserve Of-
ficer’s Association, volunteer for the 
ombudsman for the Department of De-
fense, Support of the Guard and Re-
serve Committee, and a very active 
member 
in 
his 
church—Petersburg 
United Methodist Church. In 2018, Colo-
nel Myer was recognized as one of the 
top 200 veterans in Illinois for the 
State’s 200th birthday.

REMEMBERING COLONEL JAMES 
A. SMITH, JR. 
∑ Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the re-
markable life of Retired Colonel James 
A. Smith, Jr., a 31 year veteran of the 
Illinois Army National Guard who 
passed away on May 11, 2022. 
Colonel Smith started his career in 
1977 as an enlisted soldier, commis-
sioning in 1982 through the Illinois 
Army National Guard’s Officer Can-
didate School. He served in various 
staff and leadership positions through-
out his career in the Illinois National 
Guard. 
In 2003, Colonel Smith was appointed 
as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Per-
sonnel (G–1). In this role, he played an 
integral role in preparing Illinois Army 
National Guard units for deployment 
to Iraq and then Afghanistan. In 2008, 
before his retirement, he was appointed 
as the Illinois Army National Guard 
chief of staff before being appointed 
the Illinois Department of Military Af-
fairs chief of staff that same year. 
As the IDMA chief of staff, Colonel 
Smith supported multiple Illinois Na-
tional Guard deployments, the Illinois 
National Guard’s response to floods, 
hurricanes, and wildfires, the 2012 
NATO Summit in Chicago, and most 
recently, the Illinois National Guard’s 
COVID–19 response, as well as law en-
forcement support missions. 
Colonel Smith was proud of being an 
infantry officer, a devout Catholic, and 
an unwavering Cardinals fan. He was a 
strong advocate for Lincoln’s Chal-
lenge Academy and its cadets, the Illi-
nois Military Family Relief Fund, the 
Illinois State Military Museum, the 
National Guard Association of Illinois, 
and, most of all, the soldiers and air-
men of the Illinois National Guard and 
their families. 
Colonel Jim Smith’s voice will not be 
heard again in the Illinois National 
Guard’s buildings or training areas, but 
his spirit will remain within this orga-
nization for many generations to come. 
He leaves behind his wife Nilsa and 
their son Sam. May his legacy of serv-
ice and kind spirit serve as an inspira-
tion to us all.∑

TRIBUTE TO SCOTT ROBINSON 
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today, I 
want to recognize and offer my sincere 
congratulations to Scott Robinson, di-
rector of the Port of Muskogee, on his 
retirement after 31 years of service. I 
have had the pleasure of working with 
Scott for a number of years, and we 
have done a lot of good work together. 
When I came to Congress, I set out 
with the notion to let the world know 
that Oklahoma is navigable, and with 
Scott’s help, we have been able to do 
that. He has been a long-time advocate 
for Oklahoma’s inland waterways, serv-
ing on various waterways boards and 
commissions and testifying before the 
Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee. 
Through his advocacy and leadership, 
Scott and I worked quickly to help the 
Port of Muskogee recover after the his-
toric 2019 floods that decimated the Ar-
kansas River Basin, including working 
to deliver millions of dollars to ensure 
the port could rebuild for the future. 
Under Scott’s tenure, the port has 
grown tremendously as he oversaw the 
port’s expansion of property that has 
allowed industries to invest over $2 bil-
lion into the port’s facilities and create 
more than 2,500 jobs. Because of Scott, 
the port is a true multimodal transpor-
tation hub for the region. 
As port director, Scott never missed 
an opportunity to highlight the impor-
tance of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas 
River Navigation System—MKARNS— 
and its contribution to the long-term 
strength and security of the U.S. econ-
omy, including supporting thousands of 
jobs, and providing billions of dollars 
in sales impacts and transportation 
costs 
savings. 
His 
tireless 
work 
throughout the years has ensured that 
the Port of Muskogee and MKARNS 
system will continue to serve Okla-
homa and our Nation for decades to 
come. Oklahoma and the entire Nation 
have benefited greatly from his leader-
ship, and his legacy will not be soon 
forgotten. 
Congratulations 
again, 
Scott, 
on 
your well-deserved retirement.∑

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MIN-
NESOTA YMCA YOUTH IN GOV-
ERNMENT PROGRAM 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today, I am proud to stand with my 
colleague, Senator SMITH, to recognize 
an organization that has meant so 
much to the people of Minnesota. 
On June 4, 2022, the Minnesota YMCA 
Youth in Government Program cele-
brates its 75th anniversary. The Min-
nesota YMCA Youth in Government 
Program is a youth-led, nonpartisan, 
experiential learning program that de-
velops and promotes lifelong, active, 
responsible citizenship in our youth. 
Annually, the program brings middle 
and high school students from across 
Minnesota to create a mock State gov-
ernment in the State capitol, complete 
with legislative branches for upper and 
lower classmen, a court, an executive 
branch, lobbyists, and a press corps. 
The program has been developing to-
morrow’s leaders since 1946 and, since 
that time, has served over 54,000 middle 
school 
and 
high 
school 
students. 
Today, the Minnesota YMCA Youth in 
Government program stands as one of 
the largest and longest running Youth 
in Government programs in the Nation. 
Through Youth in Government, stu-
dents learn to write bills, debate 
issues, argue court cases, elect their 
own leaders, and actively participate in 
an authentic model of real-life legisla-
tive, executive, and judicial processes 
and structures. Youth in Government 
students learn about the importance of 
accountability, responsibility, and the 
value of getting involved in civic af-
fairs while developing self-confidence 
and learning their voices matter and 
need to be heard within the State’s— 
and Nation’s—policy and decision-mak-
ing process. 
This vital program creates an envi-
ronment for students to have meaning-
ful and respectful conversations where 
students can learn from each other 
about today’s issues while fully ac-
knowledging that each student brings a 
different life experience to the table, a 
skill that they will carry with them for 
the rest of their lives. It is through 
this experience that Youth in Govern-
ment teaches young people that they 
have an important and immediate 
stake in the decisions that shape the 
future of not only the State of Min-
nesota, but of their Nation and the 
world. 
The program motto for Minnesota 
Youth in Government is ‘‘Democracy 
must be learned by each generation,’’ 
which is more important today than 
ever. 
I ask that my colleagues join Ms. 
SMITH and myself in honoring the Min-
nesota YMCA Youth in Government 
Program.

50TH PASTORAL ANNIVERSARY OF 
REV. DR. CALVIN MCKINNEY 
∑ Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I rise to recognize and congratu-
late my friend the Reverend Dr. Calvin 
McKinney on his 50th pastoral anniver-
sary. Pastor McKinney has served as 
pastor of Calvary Baptist Church of 
North Jersey since 1972. 
Pastor McKinney’s ministry is guid-
ed by Teaching and Growing a Praying 
People of God, whether at home in New 
Jersey, across our Nation, or around 
the world. His ministry has taken him 
throughout Africa, Europe, Asia, Cen-
tral America, and the Caribbean Is-
lands. Of his many accomplishments, 
Pastor McKinney’s most memorable 
preaching opportunity was during the 
centennial session of the National Bap-
tist Convention, U.S.A., Inc., in Bir-
mingham, AL, in 1980. 
In September 2009, Pastor McKinney 
was elected general secretary of the 
National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., 
Inc. He served as the youngest moder-
ator in the history of the North Jersey 
District Missionary Baptist Associa-
tion from 1986 to 1990, and served from 
1996 through 2000 in an unprecedented 
tenure as one of the youngest presi-
dents in the history of the 300,000-mem-
ber General Baptist Convention of New 
Jersey, Inc. He was named president 
emeritus in recognition of his exem-
plary leadership. 
In 2003, under the visionary leader-
ship of Pastor McKinney, Calvary 
started on a journey to build a $10 mil-
lion, 1,500-seat sanctuary along with

educational, fellowship, and adminis-
trative facilities. On March 19, 2006, the 
congregation of Calvary moved into 
their new home. 
Pastor 
McKinney’s 
extraordinary 
pastoral leadership is matched by his 
extraordinary role as a community 
leader. For 50 years, he has touched the 
lives of countless people and commu-
nities. In addition to lifting and guid-
ing their spiritual formation, he has 
met the needs of his local community 
through the Calvary Community De-
velopment Center, CCDC. Since 1998, 
CCDC has empowered people and the 
community in order to knock down 
economic and social barriers. It is a re-
source for those who are need of food, 
clothing, and emergency assistance. 
Pastor McKinney finds time to serve 
in a multitude of ways. He presently 
serves as chair of the Commission on 
Faith-Based Initiatives for the State of 
New Jersey. He serves as chairman of 
the Board of Trustees of the U.C.C. Day 
Care Center No. 100; trustee, Passaic 
County Community College; a board 
member of the Bergen County Urban 
League, NJ; an executive board mem-
ber of the Garfield/Lodi Branch of the 
NAACP, NJ; and a member of Mt. Zion 
Lodge No. 50, F. & A.M. (PHA) of Hack-
ensack, NJ. 
Pastor McKinney is the embodiment 
of a spirit-filled and joyful life. His 
greatest joy comes from his beautiful 
family. He and his wife Brendalyn are 
the proud parents of three children: 
Terence Lamar, Gina Lynelle, and Cal-
vin James; and the proud grandparents 
of Terence Laquan, Timothy Lamar, 
and Mason James. 
In the Book of Matthew 5:16 we are 
taught, ‘‘In the same way, let your 
light shine before others, that they 
may see your good deeds and glorify 
your Father in heaven.’’ For 50 years, 
Pastor McKinney has been more than 
just a shining light; he is truly a bea-
con of faith, hope, and love. His min-
istry blesses us all.∑

RECOGNIZING BENEDICTINE COL-
LEGE 
RAVENS 
WOMEN’S 
LA-
CROSSE 
∑ Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today, I 
would like to congratulate the Bene-
dictine Ravens on a wonderful 2022 sea-
son and their NAIA National Cham-
pionship victory. 
Winning a national championship is 
no easy feat. It takes years of dedica-
tion, and this championship is the re-
sult of that dedication. You have made 
your school, as well as our entire 
State, proud. This national champion-
ship is particularly special as it is the 
first ever for the Benedictine Women’s 
Lacrosse team and the first for the col-
lege since 1967. 
I know many of you came here to 
play lacrosse, but along the way, I hope 
you have made lifelong friends, learned 
valuable lessons about hard work and 
determination, and given back to this 
community. 
What makes this victory even more 
special is the adversity these women 
had 
to 
overcome. 
Senior 
Natalie 
Wechter, the reigning NAIA National 
Player of the Year, injured her knee in 
the semifinals. Despite this setback, 
through 
persistence 
and 
grit, 
the 
Ravens edged out their opponents by a 
score of 9–8. 
Winning a national championship is 
also a full team effort. I would like to 
recognize a few outstanding members 
of the team: Ms. Wechter, as well as 
Clare Ryan, Aiden McEnerney, Erica 
Odell, and Rianna England, who re-
ceived All-American honors. Addition-
ally, Ms. Odell was named the tour-
nament MVP. 
It is also worth mentioning that this 
was head coach Clare Hanson’s first 
year in the position. I congratulate all 
on these accomplishments. 
Winning this tournament is one of 
those things small colleges remember 
and discuss for decades. It is a shared 
win that the whole Benedictine and 
Atchison community gets to appreciate 
and take pride in. 
I commend you and the entire team 
for your hard work and dedication. 
Congratulations to the 2022 NAIA wom-
en’s lacrosse champion Ravens.∑

REMEMBERING ANGIE RUVO 
∑ Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a beloved mem-
ber of the Las Vegas community, Angie 
Ruvo, who passed away this month at 
the age of 98. Recognized as Las Vegas’ 
first celebrity chef, Angie, along with 
her husband Lou, her sister Maria, 
brother-in-law Al, and son Larry, es-
tablished the Venetian Pizzeria in 
downtown Las Vegas in 1955—the first 
pizza restaurant in Las Vegas. Later 
known as the Venetian Ristorante and 
Pizzeria, the famed restaurant hosted a 
wide array of clientele, ranging from 
celebrities such as Frank Sinatra—a 
customer so loyal he enlisted a bell-
man to pick up dinner for him from 
there every night—to tourists who 
traveled from across the country and 
all over the world to experience the 
warmth and comfort of Angie’s cook-
ing. 
Born in Niagara Falls, Angie became 
the matriarch of the Las Vegas res-
taurant scene almost as soon as she 
came to Nevada, but her remarkable 
legacy in the Silver State goes beyond 
her business and culinary achieve-
ments. When her late husband Lou was 
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, Angie em-
braced the role of devoted caregiver. 
Sharing her own experience and advice 
with other caregivers became a signifi-
cant role for Angie, and she frequently 
reminded other caregivers of the im-
portance of self-care. In 2009, Larry 
Ruvo and his wife Camille opened the 
Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for 
Brain Health in his father’s memory. 
In honor of her 94th birthday, Larry 
and Camille created the Angie Ruvo 
Endowed Caregiving Chair, which pro-
vides financial support to caregiving 
research at the Lou Ruvo Center. 
In addition to being a champion for 
caregivers, Angie dedicated her life to 
charitable work in her community and 
was honored by various organizations 
over the years, including receiving the 
Augustus Society’s Justinian Award, 
presented to notable Nevada Italian 
Americans. A woman praised and rec-
ognized by Senators and celebrities 
alike—and for whom Nevada Governors 
issued 
official 
proclamations—Angie 
lived a life of philanthropy, generosity, 
and dedication. Her passing marks an 
immeasurable loss to her family, our 
community, and the Nation. May her 
memory be a blessing.∑

TRIBUTE TO KIRK MILLER 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would 
like to share a few words today to 
honor an outstanding Montana educa-
tor who is retiring at the end of this 
school year. 
Kirk Miller has dedicated his career 
to bettering the lives of the next gen-
eration of Montanans. Over the years, 
Kirk served as a teacher, a principal, 
and a superintendent before being ap-
pointed to the Montana Board of Pub-
lic Education where he later served as 
chair. I first got to know Kirk Miller 
when I was a State senator, and he was 
the superintendent of schools in Havre, 
MT. I found him to be somebody who 
was dedicated above all to the kids’ 
education, somebody who knew the 
value of public education and always 
did his best to make sure our kids got 
an education that would allow them to 
compete in the worldwide economy. As 
Bozeman schools superintendent, Kirk 
played a key role in improving infra-
structure for students for years to 
come. He championed numerous suc-
cessful initiatives that supported that 
strengthened public education in the 
region and serve as a template for 
other communities to follow. 
At the end of this year, Kirk will be 
retiring from his most recent position 
as executive director of the School Ad-
ministrators of Montana, where he has 
worked tirelessly to support adminis-
trators and educators across the State. 
Those who have been lucky enough to 
work with Kirk recognize that he has a 
knack for connecting with people, even 
those who have different views than his 
own. And his passion for public edu-
cation shines through in everything he 
does. 
Under Kirk’s leadership, the School 
Administrators of Montana established 
the Leaders Professional Learning Pro-
gram, or SAM LPLP, a mentorship pro-
gram that brings administrators from 
across the State together to receive 
student-focused, solution-based profes-
sional development training. The SAM 
LPLP has served more than 500 admin-
istrators to date. As a former public 
school teacher I commend Kirk for his 
steadfast commitment to improving 
our school system from the top down. 
In addition to his work, Kirk has a 
lot to be proud of—in particular, the 
wonderful family he has built with his 
wife of 42 years, Nan. 
A lifelong educator and a dear friend 
to many, Kirk has shown through his

S. 4327. A bill to amend the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer-
gency Assistance Act to authorize the 
President to provide hazard mitigation

venting post-wildfire flooding and de-
bris flow, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. LUJA´ N, Mr. 
HEINRICH, and Mrs. MURRAY): 
S. 4328. A bill to modify the fire man-
agement assistance cost share, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Fire Suppression Im-
provement Act and the Post Fire 
Flooding and Debris Flow Act. 
Currently, the Fire Management As-
sistance Grant, FMAG, Program is 
available to State, local, and Tribal 
governments for the mitigation, man-
agement, and control of fires that 
threaten such destruction that they 
would constitute a major disaster. 
However, under current law, FMAGs 
can only be used to reimburse expenses 
incurred after it is granted. 
The Fire Suppression Improvement 
Act would explicitly allow for State or 
local governments to use FMAGs for 
the predeployment of assets and re-
sources. These predeployed assets are 
critical to suppression of fires and are 
sometimes the only way to contain a 
fire before it gets out of hand and needs 
a major disaster declaration. This bill 
would simply allow for FMAGs to help 
State and local governments cover the 
cost of fighting incidents from the be-
ginning of the high-risk event. 
Additionally, this bill would make 
FMAGs consistent with other FEMA 
disaster assistance by stating that the 
Federal cost share of FMAGs shall be 
not less than 75 percent of the eligible 
cost of such assistance. This bill does 
not mandate any cost share increase 
but 
simply 
allows 
for 
flexibility. 
FMAGS are granted on an incident-by- 
incident basis, and as we have seen 
across the West, fires often occur in 
the same area consecutively in the 
same year. 
Wildfires leave behind severe vegeta-
tion loss and soil exposure in the form 
of burn scars, which can cause destruc-
tive and large-scale flooding and debris 
flow when exposed to rainfall. Sudden 
and deadly postfire events of this type 
are well documented throughout the 
Western United States, particularly in 
Southern California. These events are 
one of the most dangerous postfire haz-
ards and pose a serious threat to life 
and property and have the possibility 
to block drainage ways and damage 
public infrastructure. 
The Post Fire Flooding and Debris 
Flow Act would explicitly include miti-
gating 
and 
preventing 
postwildfire 
flooding and debris flow as eligible 
under FEMA’s HMGP. This inclusion 
would allow for State and local govern-
ments to act quickly when storms are 
incoming to protect property, public 
infrastructure, and lives. 
This bill would also make HMGP con-
sistent with other FEMA disaster as-
sistance by stating that the Federal 
cost share of HMGP shall be not less 
than 75 percent of the eligible cost of 
such assistance. This bill does not 
mandate any increase but simply al-
lows for flexibility and increased fed-
eral assistance where necessary. 
As States and local governments con-
tinue to step up, respond, and work to 
recover from more frequent and more

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 650—RECOG-
NIZING MAY 28 AS ‘‘WORLD HUN-

VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
UKRAINIAN 
FAMINE OF 1932–1933, KNOWN AS 
THE 
HOLODOMOR, 
SHOULD 
SERVE AS A REMINDER OF RE-
PRESSIVE

AGAINST

UKRAINE’S AGRICULTURAL OUT-
PUT AND THREATENS TO EXAC-
ERBATE 
THE 
PROBLEMS 
OF 
GLOBAL 
HUNGER 
ON 
WORLD 
HUNGER DAY 
Mr. 
KAINE 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
PORTMAN, Mr. DURBIN, and Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 650 
Whereas Ukraine is a major global ex-
porter of agricultural products critical to 
global food supplies, including wheat, corn, 
barley, and sunflower; 
Whereas Ukrainian wheat output has de-
creased by 34 percent, and corn, barley, and 
other grain output has decreased by more 
than 50 percent in the past year as a result 
of Russia’s war against Ukraine; 
Whereas Russia’s illegal occupation of the 
Crimean peninsula and Ukrainian Black Sea 
ports of Mariupol and Kherson, its assault on 
Odessa, its use of naval mines in the Black 
Sea and land mines in Ukraine’s agricultural 
areas, and the destruction of Ukrainian ex-
port terminals and transportation infra-
structure 
have 
severely 
constrained 
Ukraine’s ability to export grain; 
Whereas the number of people around the 
world facing acute food insecurity greatly 
increased 
from 
135,000,000 
in 
2019, 
to 
193,000,000 in 2021, nearly 40,000,000 people ex-
perienced emergency levels of acute food in-
security (just one step away from famine) in 
2021, and the number of people experiencing 
such food insecurity is projected to increase 
in 2022; 
Whereas the effects of Russia’s illegal in-
vasion of Ukraine are expected to increase 
global grain prices and disproportionately 
impact low- and middle-income countries in 
the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, 
and sub-Saharan Africa who are dependent 
on imported Ukrainian wheat; 
Whereas the totality of these actions by 
Russia represents an intentional and con-
certed effort to attack the Ukrainian agri-
cultural sector resembling the Ukrainian 
Famine of 1932–1933, which was caused by the 
former Soviet Union; 
Whereas, Senate Resolution 435, which was 
passed by the Senate on October 3, 2018, com-
memorated the 85th anniversary of the 
Holodomor 
and 
recognized 
the 
Soviet 
Union’s role in perpetrating this genocide 
against the Ukrainian people; 
Whereas 2022–2023 marks the 90th anniver-
sary of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932–1933, 
which is also known as the Holodomor; 
Whereas, in 1932 and 1933, millions of 
Ukrainian people perished at the will of the 
totalitarian Stalinist government of the 
former Soviet Union, which perpetrated a 
premeditated famine in Ukraine in an effort 
to break the nation’s resistance to collec-
tivization and communist occupation; 
Whereas the Government of the Soviet 
Union deliberately confiscated grain har-
vests and starved millions of Ukrainian men, 
women, and children by a policy of forced 
collectivization that sought to destroy the 
nationally conscious movement for inde-
pendence; 
Whereas Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin or-
dered the borders of Ukraine sealed to pre-
vent anyone from escaping the manmade 
starvation and to prevent the delivery of any 
international food aid that would provide re-
lief to the starving; 
Whereas 
numerous 
scholars 
worldwide 
have worked to uncover the scale of the fam-
ine, including Canadian wheat expert An-
drew Cairns who visited Ukraine in 1932, and 
was told that there was no grain ‘‘because 
the government had collected so much grain 
and exported it to England and Italy’’, while 
Joseph Stalin simultaneously denied food 
aid to the people of Ukraine; 
Whereas nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s 
rural population perished or were forced into 
exile due to the induced starvation and the 
entire nation suffered from the consequences 
of the prolonged famine; 
Whereas noted correspondents of the time 
were refuted for their courage in depicting 
and reporting on the forced famine in 
Ukraine, including Gareth Jones, William 
Henry 
Chamberlin, 
and 
Malcolm 
Muggeridge, who wrote ‘‘[The peasants] will 
tell you that many have already died of fam-
ine, and that many are dying every day; that 
thousands have been shot by the Govern-
ment and hundreds of thousands exiled. . .’’; 
Whereas title V of the Departments of 
Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1986 
(Public Law 99–180; 99 Stat. 1157), which was 
enacted on December 13, 1985, established the 
Commission on the Ukraine Famine to ‘‘con-
duct a study of the Ukrainian Famine of 
1932–1933 in order to expand the world’s 
knowledge of the famine and provide the 
American public with a better understanding 
of the Soviet system by revealing the Soviet 
role’’ in it; 
Whereas, with the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, archival documents became available 
that confirmed the deliberate and premedi-
tated deadly nature of the famine and that 
exposed the atrocities committed by the So-
viet government against the Ukrainian peo-
ple; 
Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who devoted his 
life to the development of legal concepts and 
norms for containing mass atrocities and 
whose tireless advocacy swayed the United 
Nations in 1948 to adopt the Convention on 
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
of Genocide, authored an essay in 1953 enti-
tled ‘‘Soviet Genocide in the Ukraine’’, 
which highlighted the ‘‘classic example of 
Soviet genocide’’ characterizing it ‘‘not sim-
ply a case of mass murder. It is a case of 
genocide, of destruction, not of individuals 
only, but of a culture and a nation’’; 
Whereas Ukraine’s law Number 376–V, 
‘‘Law of Ukraine on the Starvation in 
Ukraine of 1932–1933’’, which was enacted on 
November 28, 2006, gave official recognition 
to the Holodomor as an act of genocide 
against the Ukrainian people; 
Whereas on October 13, 2006, President 
George W. Bush signed into law Public Law 
109–340, which authorized the Government of 
Ukraine ‘‘to establish a memorial on Federal 
land in the District of Columbia to honor the 
victims of the Ukrainian famine-genocide of 
1932-1933’’, and the Holodomor Memorial was 
officially dedicated in November 2015; 
Whereas the Government of Ukraine and 
the Ukrainian communities in the United 
States and worldwide continue their efforts 
to secure greater international awareness 
and understanding of the 1932–1933 tragedy; 
and 
Whereas victims of the Holodomor of 1932– 
1933 will be commemorated by Ukrainian 
communities 
around 
the 
globe 
and 
in 
Ukraine through November 2022: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns Vladimir Putin’s illegal war 
in Ukraine, and his weaponization of hunger, 
which has increased global food prices and 
food insecurity in the world; 
(2) calls upon Vladimir Putin and the Rus-
sian Armed Forces to immediately cease 
their blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports 
to allow all Ukrainian food exports to re-
sume; 
(3) calls attention to the impending global 
food crisis by observing May 28, 2022 as 
‘‘World Hunger Day’’; 
(4) solemnly remembers the 90th anniver-
sary of the Holodomor of 1932–1933, and ex-
tends its deepest sympathies to the victims, 
survivors, and families of this tragedy; 
(5) condemns the systematic violations of 
human rights, including the freedom of self- 
determination and freedom of speech of the 
Ukrainian people by the Government of the 
Soviet Union; 
(6) recognizes the findings of the Commis-
sion on the Ukraine Famine, as submitted to 
Congress on April 22, 1988, including that 
‘‘Joseph Stalin and those around him com-
mitted genocide against the Ukrainians in 
1932–1933’’; 
(7) encourages dissemination of informa-
tion regarding the Holodomor of 1932–1933 in 
order to expand the world’s knowledge of 
this manmade tragedy; and 
(8) supports the continuing efforts of the 
people of Ukraine to defend themselves 
against Russian aggression, to work toward 
ensuring democratic principles, a free econ-
omy, and full respect for human rights in 
order to enable Ukraine to achieve its full 
potential in accord with the desires of the 
Ukrainian people and to deepen the partner-
ship between Ukraine, the United States, 
and all democratic nations.

May 26, 2022 
Whereas, since 1968, more people have died 
from guns in the United States than have 
died on the battlefields of all the wars in the 
history of the United States; 
Whereas 2021 was one of the deadliest years 
on record for the United States, with an esti-
mated 20,700 people killed in gun homicides 
or nonsuicide-related shootings, a 6 percent 
increase over 2020; 
Whereas unintentional shooting deaths by 
children recently increased by nearly 1⁄3, 
comparing incidents in March to December 
of 2020 to the same months in 2019; 
Whereas, by 1 count, in 2021 in the United 
States, there were 693 mass shooting inci-
dents in which at least 4 people were killed 
or wounded by gunfire; 
Whereas, since 2010, 65,000 veterans of the 
Armed Forces have died by suicide in the 
United States, with the overwhelming ma-
jority of such deaths being the result of a 
firearm; 
Whereas, every year in the United States, 
more than 3,500 children and teens are killed 
by gun violence and 15,000 children and teens 
are shot and wounded; 
Whereas approximately 8,500 people in the 
United States under the age of 25 die because 
of gun violence annually, including Hadiya 
Pendleton, who, in 2013, was killed at 15 
years of age in Chicago, Illinois, while stand-

Whereas, on June 3, 2022, to recognize the 
25th birthday of Hadiya Pendleton (born 
June 2, 1997), people across the United States 
will recognize National Gun Violence Aware-
ness Day and wear orange in tribute to— 
(1) Hadiya Pendleton and other victims of

Mr. TESTER, Mr. OSSOFF, and Mr. SCHU-
MER) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 652 
Whereas individuals who are lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and queer (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) include indi-
viduals from— 
(1) all States, territories, and the District 
of Columbia; and 
(2) all faiths, races, national origins, socio-
economic statuses, disability statuses, edu-
cation levels, and political beliefs; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States have made, and continue to make, 
vital contributions to the United States and 
to the world in every aspect, including in the 
fields of education, law, health, business, 
science, research, economic development, ar-
chitecture, 
fashion, 
sports, 
government, 
music, film, politics, technology, literature, 
and civil rights; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has com-
pounded 
the 
systemic 
inequality 
that 
LGBTQ individuals face in the healthcare, 
employment, and housing systems in the 
United States, which has led to a disparate 
impact on LGBTQ individuals; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States served on the front lines during the 
COVID–19 pandemic as doctors, nurses, med-
ical professionals, law enforcement officers, 
firefighters, and first responders in all 
States, territories, and the District of Co-
lumbia; 
Whereas the persistent failure of Federal 
and State officials to collect full and accu-
rate data on sexual orientation and gender 
identity causes tremendous harm to LGBTQ 
individuals in the United States, who remain 
largely invisible to the government entities 
entrusted with ensuring their health, safety, 
and well-being; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States serve, and have served, in the United 
States Army, Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force, 
and Marines honorably and with distinction 
and bravery; 
Whereas a decades-long Federal policy, 
known as the ‘‘Lavender Scare’’, threatened 
and intimidated Federal public servants 
from employment due to their sexual ori-
entation by alleging LGBTQ individuals 
posed a threat to national security, pre-
venting many more from entering the work-
force; 
Whereas an estimated number of more 
than 100,000 brave service members were dis-
charged from the Armed Forces of the 
United States between the beginning of 
World War II and 2011 because of their sexual 
orientation, including the discharge of more 
than 13,000 service members under the 
‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ policy in place be-
tween 1994 and 2011; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States serve, and have served, in positions in 
the Federal Government and State and local 
governments, including as members of Con-
gress, Cabinet Secretaries, Governors, may-
ors, and city council members; 
Whereas the demonstrators who protested 
on June 28, 1969, following a law enforcement 
raid of the Stonewall Inn, an LGBTQ club in 
New York City, are pioneers of the LGBTQ 
movement for equality; 
Whereas, throughout much of the history 
of the United States, same-sex relationships 
were criminalized in many States, and many 
LGBTQ individuals in the United States 
were forced to hide their LGBTQ identities 
while living in secrecy and fear; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme 
Court 
of 
the 
United 
States 
ruled 
in 
Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), that 
same-sex couples have a constitutional right 
to marry and acknowledged that ‘‘[n]o union 
is more profound than marriage, for it em-
bodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, de-
votion, sacrifice, and family’’; 
Whereas efforts to overturn nearly 50 years 
of legal precedent, established through Roe 
v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Planned Par-
enthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), which 
has affirmed the constitutional right to ter-
minate a pregnancy, could potentially under-
mine and erode other constitutional rights 
also grounded in privacy, including the right 
of same-sex couples to marry and even the 
right to engage in consensual same-sex rela-
tionships without risking criminal prosecu-
tion; 
Whereas Acquired Immunodeficiency Syn-
drome (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘AIDS’’) has disproportionately impacted 
LGBTQ individuals in the United States, due 
in part to a lack of funding and research de-
voted to finding effective treatments for 
AIDS and the Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘HIV’’) 
during the early stages of the HIV and AIDS 
epidemic; 
Whereas 
gay 
and 
bisexual 
men 
and 
transgender women of color have a higher 
risk of contracting HIV; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community maintains 
its unwavering commitment to ending the 
HIV and AIDS epidemic; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States 
face 
disparities 
in 
employment, 
healthcare, education, housing, and many 
other areas central to the pursuit of happi-
ness in the United States; 
Whereas 28 States have no explicit ban on 
discrimination based on sexual orientation 
and gender identity in the workplace, hous-
ing, or public accommodations, and 34 States 
have no explicit ban on discrimination 
against LGBTQ individuals in education; 
Whereas LGBTQ youth are at increased 
risk of— 
(1) suicide; 
(2) homelessness; 
(3) becoming victims of bullying, violence, 
or human trafficking; and 
(4) developing mental health conditions, 
including anxiety and depression; 
Whereas only 13 States and the District of 
Columbia have explicit policies in place to 
protect foster youth from discrimination 
based on both sexual orientation and gender 
identity; 
Whereas LGBTQ youth of color are over-
represented in child welfare and juvenile jus-
tice systems; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community has faced 
discrimination, 
inequality, 
and 
violence 
throughout the history of the United States; 
Whereas State legislatures across the 
country have introduced and passed harmful 
legislation specifically targeting LGBTQ 
youth, particularly transgender youth, and 
their ability to obtain access to healthcare, 
participate in athletic activities, and learn 
about race, gender, and sexuality in schools; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States, in particular transgender individuals, 
face a disproportionately high risk of becom-
ing victims of violent hate crimes; 
Whereas members of the LGBTQ commu-
nity have been targeted in acts of mass vio-
lence, including— 
(1) the Pulse nightclub shooting in Or-
lando, Florida, on June 12, 2016, where 49 peo-
ple were killed and 53 people were wounded; 
and 
(2) the arson attack at the UpStairs 
Lounge in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 
24, 1973, where 32 people died;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2757 
May 26, 2022 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States face persecution, violence, and death 
in many parts of the world, including State- 
sponsored violence; 
Whereas, in the several years preceding 
2019, hundreds of LGBTQ individuals around 
the world were arrested and, in some cases, 
tortured or even executed because of their 
actual or perceived sexual orientation or 
gender identity in countries and territories 
such as Chechnya, Egypt, Indonesia, and 
Tanzania; 
Whereas, in May 2019, Taiwan became the 
first place in Asia to extend marriage rights 
to same-sex couples; 
Whereas, since June 2019, Ecuador, North-
ern Ireland, and Costa Rica have extended 
marriage rights to same-sex couples, the 
most recent country-wide extensions of 
those rights in the world; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community holds 
Pride festivals and marches in some of the 
most dangerous places in the world, despite 
threats of violence and arrest; 
Whereas, in 2009, President Barack Obama 
signed the Matthew Shepard and James 
Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (divi-
sion E of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) 
into law to protect all individuals in the 
United States from crimes motivated by 
their actual or perceived sexual orientation 
or gender identity; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States have fought for equal treatment, dig-
nity, and respect; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States have achieved significant milestones, 
ensuring that future generations of LGBTQ 
individuals in the United States will enjoy a 
more equal and just society; 
Whereas, 
despite 
being 
marginalized 
throughout the history of the United States, 
LGBTQ individuals in the United States con-
tinue to celebrate their identities, love, and 
contributions to the United States in various 
expressions of Pride; 
Whereas Pride is a celebration of visibility 
in spite of marginalization, and the LGBTQ 
community will continue to observe this sig-
nificant cultural practice even though phys-
ical Pride celebrations may be compromised 
in June 2022 due to the health and safety 
needs of all individuals involved; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the Supreme Court 
of the United States affirmed that existing 
civil rights laws prohibit employment dis-
crimination on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity, a landmark victory 
for the LGBTQ community; and 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals in the United 
States remain determined to pursue full 
equality, respect, and inclusion for all indi-
viduals regardless of sexual orientation or 
gender identity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the rights, freedoms, and equal 
treatment 
of 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) individuals in the 
United States and around the world; 
(2) acknowledges that LGBTQ rights are 
human rights that are to be protected by the 
laws of the United States and numerous 
international treaties and conventions; 
(3) supports efforts to ensure the equal 
treatment of all individuals in the United 
States, regardless of sexual orientation and 
gender identity; 
(4) supports efforts to ensure that the 
United States remains a beacon of hope for 
the equal treatment of individuals around 
the world, including LGBTQ individuals; and 
(5) encourages the celebration of June as 
‘‘LGBTQ Pride Month’’ in order to provide a 
lasting opportunity for all individuals in the 
United States— 
(A) to learn about the discrimination and 
inequality that the LGBTQ community en-
dured and continues to endure; and 
(B) to celebrate the contributions of the 
LGBTQ community throughout the history 
of the United States.

the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 653 
Whereas the people of the United States 
join together each May to pay tribute to the 
contributions of generations of Asian Ameri-
cans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Island-
ers who have enriched the history of the 
United States; 
Whereas the history of Asian Americans, 
Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders in 
the United States is inextricably tied to the 
story of the United States; 
Whereas the Asian-American, Native Ha-
waiian, and Pacific Islander community is an 
inherently diverse population, composed of 
more than 45 distinct ethnicities and more 
than 100 language dialects; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the 
Census, the Asian-American population grew 
faster than any other racial or ethnic group 
over the last decade, surging nearly 55.5 per-
cent between 2010 and 2020, and during that

ulation of the United States; 
Whereas the month of May was selected for 
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month be-
cause the first Japanese immigrants arrived 
in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the 
first transcontinental railroad was com-
pleted on May 10, 1869, with substantial con-
tributions from Chinese immigrants; 
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United 
States Code, officially designates May as

United States to observe the month with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-

Whereas 2022 marks several important 
milestones for the Asian-American and Pa-
cific Islander community, including— 
(1) the 140th anniversary of the enactment

spurred a series of anti-immigrant policies 
targeting immigration from the Asia-Pacific

(4) the 15th anniversary of the establish-
ment of the Asian American and Native 
American Pacific Islander-Serving Institu-
tions program, which was authorized under 
the College Cost Reduction and Access Act 
(Public Law 110–84; 121 Stat. 784); 
Whereas Asian Americans, Native Hawai-
ians, and Pacific Islanders have made signifi-
cant contributions to the United States at 
all levels of the Federal Government and in 
the United States Armed Forces, including— 
(1) Daniel K. Inouye, a Medal of Honor and

Asian-American, Native Hawaiian, and Pa-
cific Islander issues may be established; 
Whereas, in 2022, Asian Americans, Native

crimes in 2021, and the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation recorded a 73 percent increase in 
such crimes in 2020; 
Whereas, since March 2020, there has been 
a dramatic increase in reports of anti-Asian 
hate crimes and incidents related to the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
including 
approxi-
mately 11,000 hate incidents, including shun-
ning, verbal and online harassment, physical 
assault, and civil rights violations, that were 
reported to Stop AAPI Hate from the start of 
the pandemic through December 31, 2021, and 
countless other incidents that have not been 
reported; 
Whereas, according to a survey conducted 
during September and October of 2021 by 
Stop AAPI Hate, 1 in 5 Asian Americans (21.2 
percent) and Pacific Islanders (20.0 percent) 
reported experiencing a hate incident in the 
past year; 
Whereas 
discrimination 
against 
Asian 
Americans, especially in moments of crisis, 
is not a new phenomenon, and violence 
against 
Asian 
Americans 
has 
occurred 
throughout United States history, includ-
ing— 
(1) the enactment of Page Act of 1875, 
which restricted entry of Chinese, Japanese, 
and other Asian women to the United States 
and effectively prohibited the immigration 
of Chinese women, preventing the formation 
of Chinese families in the United States and 
limiting the number of native-born Chinese 
citizens; 
(2) the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion 
Act of 1882, which was the first law to explic-
itly exclude an entire ethnic group from im-
migrating to the United States; 
(3) the issuance of Executive Order 9066 in 
1942, which authorized the forced relocation 
and incarceration of approximately 120,000 
individuals of Japanese ancestry during 
World War II, the majority of whom were 
United States citizens; 
(4) the murder of Vincent Chin; 
(5) the Cleveland Elementary School shoot-
ing on January 17, 1989, in which a gunman 
used an AK–47 to kill 5 children, 4 of whom 
were of Southeast Asian descent; 
(6) the rise in discrimination and violence 
against Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian 
Americans following the September 11, 2001, 
attacks on the World Trade Center and the 
Pentagon; 
(7) the mass shooting at a Sikh temple in 
Oak Creek, Wisconsin, on August 5, 2012, in 
which a white supremacist fatally shot 6 peo-
ple and wounded 4 others; 
(8) the shooting of 9 people near Atlanta, 
Georgia, on March 16, 2021, at 3 separate 
Asian-owned businesses, in which 8 people 
were killed, including 6 Asian women; and 
(9) the shooting of 6 people in Laguna 
Woods, California, on May 15, 2022, in which 
members of the Irvine Taiwanese Pres-
byterian Church were targeted; 
Whereas, in response to the uptick in anti- 
Asian hate crimes throughout the COVID–19 
pandemic, Congress passed the COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act (Public Law 117–13; 135 Stat. 
265), which was signed into law by President 
Joseph R. Biden on May 20, 2021; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has deep-
ly impacted the Asian-American and Pacific 
Islander community; 
Whereas Asian Americans, Native Hawai-
ians, and Pacific Islanders have been dis-
proportionately impacted by the COVID–19 
pandemic, and Native Hawaiians and Pacific 
Islanders have faced among the highest in-
fection and mortality rates out of any racial 
group in several States; 
Whereas more than 2,000,000 Asian-Amer-
ican, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander 
first responders, health care providers, and 
frontline workers are among the unsung he-
roes in the Nation’s fight against COVID–19; 
Whereas there remains much to be done to 
ensure that Asian Americans, Native Hawai-
ians, and Pacific Islanders have access to re-
sources and a voice in the Government of the 
United States and continue to advance in the 
political landscape of the United States; and 
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific Amer-
ican Heritage Month provides the people of 
the United States with an opportunity to 
recognize the achievements, contributions, 
and history of, and to understand the chal-
lenges faced by Asian Americans, Native Ha-
waiians, and Pacific Islanders: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the significance of Asian/Pa-
cific American Heritage Month as an impor-
tant time to celebrate the significant con-
tributions of Asian Americans, Native Ha-
waiians, and Pacific Islanders to the history 
of the United States; and 
(2) recognizes that Asian-American, Native 
Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities 
enhance the rich diversity of and strengthen 
the United States.

PETERS, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. KING, Mr. 
ROUNDS, Mr. MARSHALL, Mr. WYDEN, 
Ms. ROSEN, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. PADILLA, 
Mr. BOOKER, and Ms. KLOBUCHAR) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 654 
Whereas hundreds of millions of individ-
uals in the United States participate in out-
door recreation annually; 
Whereas Congress enacted the Outdoor 
Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act of 
2016 (Public Law 114–249; 130 Stat. 999) to as-
sess and analyze the outdoor recreation 
economy of the United States and the effects 
attributable to the outdoor recreation econ-
omy on the overall economy of the United 
States; 
Whereas the Outdoor Recreation Satellite 
Account, updated in November 2021 by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Depart-
ment of Commerce, shows that outdoor 
recreation 
generated 
more 
than 
$374,300,000,000 in economic output in 2020, 
comprising approximately 1.8 percent of the 
current-dollar gross domestic product; 
Whereas the Outdoor Recreation Satellite 
Account shows that, in 2020, the outdoor 
recreation sector provided 4,300,000 jobs 
across the United States; 
Whereas the Great American Outdoors Act 
(Public Law 116–152; 134 Stat. 682) provides 
approximately $2,000,000,000 per year to help 
eliminate the maintenance backlog on public 
lands and waters and fully funds the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund; 
Whereas regular outdoor recreation is as-
sociated with economic growth, positive 
health outcomes, and better quality of life; 
Whereas outdoor recreation activities at 
the Federal, State, and local levels have seen 
a recent surge in participation; 
Whereas many outdoor recreation busi-
nesses are small businesses that were heavily 
impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas outdoor recreation businesses are 
cornerstones of rural communities and out-
door recreation is part of the national herit-
age of the United States; 
Whereas it is imperative that the United 
States ensure that access to outdoor recre-
ation is inclusive, equitable, and available to 
all its people for generations to come; and 
Whereas June 2022 is an appropriate month 
to designate as ‘‘Great Outdoors Month’’ to 
provide an opportunity to celebrate the im-
portance of the great outdoors: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 2022 as ‘‘Great Outdoors 
Month’’; and 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States to responsibly participate in recre-
ation activities in the great outdoors during 
June 2022 and year-round.

THOSE 
SCAMS FOR SENIORS 
Ms. 
COLLINS 
(for 
herself, 
Ms. 
SINEMA, and Mr. SCOTT of Florida) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 655 
Whereas millions of individuals age 65 or 
older (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘sen-
iors’’) in the United States are targeted by 
scams each year, including vacation scams, 
Social Security impersonation scams and In-
ternal 
Revenue 
Service 
impersonation 
scams, other government agency imperson-
ation scams, veterans benefits scams, sweep-
stakes scams, romance scams, computer tech 
support scams, grandparent scams, debt col-
lection scams, home improvement scams, 
fraudulent investment schemes, pet scams, 
and identity theft; 
Whereas other types of fraud perpetrated 
against seniors include Medicare imperson-
ation fraud, health care fraud, health insur-
ance fraud, counterfeit prescription drug 
fraud, funeral and cemetery fraud, ‘‘anti- 
aging’’ product fraud, telemarketing fraud, 
charity and disaster scams, internet fraud, 
and cyberattacks; 
Whereas the Government Accountability 
Office has estimated that seniors lose a stag-
gering $2,900,000,000 each year to an ever- 
growing 
array 
of 
financial 
exploitation 
schemes and scams; 
Whereas, since 2013, the Fraud Hotline of 
the Special Committee on Aging of the Sen-
ate has received more than 10,000 complaints 
reporting possible scams from individuals in 
all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; 
Whereas the ease with which criminals 
contact seniors through the internet and 
telephone 
increases 
as 
more 
creative 
schemes emerge; 
Whereas, according to the Consumer Sen-
tinel Network Data Book 2021 released by 
the Federal Trade Commission, individuals 
age 60 or older reported losing $1,034,000,000 
to fraud in 2021, with a median loss for vic-
tims age 80 or older of $1,500, nearly 3 times 
the median amount lost by those victims be-
tween the ages of 50 and 59; 
Whereas senior fraud is underreported by 
victims due to shame, stigma, and lack of in-
formation about where to report fraud; and 
Whereas May 13, 2022 is an appropriate day 
to establish as ‘‘National Senior Fraud 
Awareness Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 13, 2022 
as ‘‘National Senior Fraud Awareness Day’’; 
(2) 
recognizes 
National 
Senior 
Fraud 
Awareness Day as an opportunity to raise

awareness about the barrage of scams that 
individuals age 65 or older (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘seniors’’) in the United States 
face in person, by mail, on the phone, via 
text message, and online; 
(3) recognizes that law enforcement agen-
cies, consumer protection groups, area agen-
cies on aging, and financial institutions all 
play vital roles in— 
(A) preventing the proliferation of scams 
targeting seniors in the United States; and 
(B) educating seniors about those scams; 
(4) encourages— 
(A) the implementation of policies to pre-
vent scams targeting seniors; and

SENATE RESOLUTION 656—DESIG-
NATING 
MAY 
2022 AS ‘‘OLDER 
AMERICANS MONTH’’ 
Mr. KELLY (for himself, Mr. BRAUN, 
Mr. CASEY, Mr. SCOTT of South Caro-
lina, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. RUBIO, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. SCOTT of Florida, and Ms. 
ROSEN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 656 
Whereas President John F. Kennedy first 
designated May as ‘‘Senior Citizens Month’’ 
in 1963; 
Whereas, 
in 
1963, 
only 
approximately 
17,778,000 individuals living in the United 
States were 65 years of age or older, approxi-
mately 1⁄3 of those individuals lived in pov-
erty, and few programs existed to meet the 
needs of older individuals in the United 
States; 
Whereas, in 2021, there were more than 
55,847,953 individuals who were 65 years of 
age or older living in the United States, and 
those individuals accounted for 16.8 percent 
of the total population of the United States; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic— 
(1) more than 743,016 individuals in the 
United States who were 65 years of age or 
older have died due to COVID–19; and 
(2) more than 200,000 residents and workers 
in long-term care facilities, including more 
than 154,000 in nursing homes, have suc-
cumbed to the virus; 
Whereas approximately 11,150 individuals 
in the United States turn 65 years of age 
each day; 
Whereas, in 2021, more than 8,868,000 vet-
erans of the Armed Forces were 65 years of 
age or older; 
Whereas older individuals in the United 
States rely on Federal programs, such as 
programs under the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 301 et seq.), including the Medicare 
program under title XVIII of that Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the Medicaid program 
under title XIX of that Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et 
seq.), for financial security and high-quality 
affordable health care; 
Whereas the Older Americans Act of 1965 
(42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) provides— 
(1) supportive services to help individuals 
in the United States who are 60 years of age 
or older maintain maximum independence in 
the homes and communities of those individ-
uals; and 
(2) funding for programs, including nutri-
tion services, transportation, and care man-
agement, to assist more than 10,000,000 older 
individuals in the United States each year; 
Whereas, as local aging network leaders, 
Area Agencies on Aging are critical partners 
in the healthy aging continuum; 
Whereas, in 2021, an estimated 6,634,000 in-
dividuals in the United States who were 65 
years of age or older continued to work as 
full-time, year-round employees; 
Whereas older individuals in the United 
States play an important role in society by 
continuing to contribute their experience, 
knowledge, wisdom, and accomplishments; 
Whereas older individuals in the United 
States play vital roles in their communities 
and remain involved in volunteer work, the 
arts, cultural activities, and activities relat-
ing to mentorship and civic engagement; and 
Whereas a society that recognizes the suc-
cess of older individuals and continues to en-
hance the access of older individuals to qual-
ity and affordable health care will— 
(1) encourage the ongoing participation 
and heightened independence of older indi-
viduals; and 
(2) ensure the continued safety and well- 
being of older individuals: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 2022 as ‘‘Older Ameri-
cans Month’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to provide opportunities for older in-
dividuals to continue to flourish by— 
(A) emphasizing the importance and lead-
ership of older individuals through public 
recognition of the ongoing achievements of 
older individuals; 
(B) presenting opportunities for older indi-
viduals to share their wisdom, experience, 
and skills with younger generations; and 
(C) recognizing older individuals as valu-
able assets in strengthening communities 
across the United States.

NATING MAY 16, 2022, AS ‘‘OLDER 
AMERICANS 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
AWARENESS 
DAY’’ 
TO 
RAISE 
AWARENESS 
OF 
THE 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
NEEDS 
OF 
OLDER 
ADULTS 
Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. SCOTT of 
South Carolina, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. 
COLLINS, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. KELLY, and 
Mr. BRAUN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 657 
Whereas May 2022 is both ‘‘Older Ameri-
cans Month’’ and ‘‘Mental Health Awareness 
Month’’; 
Whereas the population of individuals age 
56 or older increased from 39,600,000 in 2009 to 
54,100,000 in 2019 and is projected to reach 
94,700,000 in 2060; 
Whereas 20 percent of older adults suffer 
from a mental health condition, such as de-
pression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or serious 
mental illness; 
Whereas older adults had a higher risk of 
suicide compared to other age groups in 2020. 
In fact, during that year— 
(1) individuals age 85 or older had the high-
est rate of suicide among all age groups; and 
(2) individuals age 75 to 84 had the second 
highest rate of suicide among all age groups. 
Whereas, according to the American Psy-
chological Association, older adults under-
utilize mental health services because of 
service constraints, limited awareness, or a 
stigma surrounding mental health; 
Whereas the opioid crisis and the COVID–19 
pandemic have negatively impacted the be-
havioral health of older adults; 
Whereas aging could possibly lead to social 
and physical changes that may increase vul-
nerability to substance use disorders; 
Whereas poor mental health and substance 
use disorders reduce life expectancy among 
older adults and increase the risk of adverse 
health outcomes and conditions, such as 
heart disease, dementia, and diabetes; 
Whereas mental health disorders for older 
adults, especially depression and anxiety, are 
major contributors to and exacerbate social 
isolation; 
Whereas mental health diagnoses drive 
spending in the Medicare and Medicaid pro-
grams for an already high-cost population; 
Whereas spending for individuals with a 
mental health disorder is more than twice 
that for individuals who are eligible for both 
such programs without such a diagnosis; 
Whereas more than one-tenth of individ-
uals age 65 or older binge drink, which is de-
fined as drinking 5 or more drinks on the 
same occasion for men or 4 or more drinks 
on the same occasion for women; and 
Whereas by 2030, the United States will 
need 5,790 more geropsychologists to meet 
the needs of older adults in the United 
States, highlighting the need for outreach to 
increase availability of trained specialists: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 16, 2022, as ‘‘Older 
Americans Mental Health Awareness Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the unmet mental health and 
substance use disorder needs of older adults; 
(3) recognizes the need for a robust mental 
health and substance use disorder workforce 
trained in the unique needs of older adults to 
screen, assess, and intervene as appropriate; 
and 
(4) recognizes the need to advance bipar-
tisan solutions to address the mental health 
needs and substance use disorder needs of 
older adults.

SENATE RESOLUTION 658—DESIG-
NATING JUNE 6, 2022, AS ‘‘CASA/ 
GAL VOLUNTEERS’ DAY’’ 
Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. YOUNG, 
Mr. LANKFORD, Ms. ROSEN, Mr. BRAUN, 
Mr. WYDEN, Mr. BOOKER, Mrs. SHAHEEN, 
and Mr. GRASSLEY) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 658 
Whereas Court Appointed Special Advocate 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘CASA’’) and 
Guardian ad Litem (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘GAL’’) volunteers advocate na-
tionwide for the best interests of children be-
fore courts in cases with allegations of abuse 
or neglect; 
Whereas CASA and GAL volunteers advo-
cate for the best interests of children by re-
lying on guiding principles that recognize 
the importance of equity, diversity, inclu-
sion, collaboration, and family preservation 
and reunification; 
Whereas more than 216,000 children in the 
United States enter the foster care system, 
through no fault of their own, due to allega-
tions of abuse or neglect and rely on adults 
to advocate on their behalf; 
Whereas CASA and GAL volunteers, ap-
pointed by a judge— 
(1) provide the court with the comprehen-
sive and objective information the court 
needs to make the most well-informed deci-
sions and help ensure positive outcomes for 
children, youth, and families; and 
(2) take time to build meaningful and au-
thentic relationships with such children, 
youth, and families; 
Whereas research shows that when a CASA 
or GAL volunteer is assigned to a case, out-
comes are strengthened for children and 
families, a higher number of services are or-
dered, and children are significantly less 
likely to reenter the child welfare system, 
perform better academically and behavior-
ally, and have higher levels of hope;

S2760 
May 26, 2022 
Whereas, in January 1974, Congress enacted 
the Child Abuse Prevention Treatment Act 
(42 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.); 
Whereas the Child Abuse Prevention Treat-
ment Act provides financial assistance to 
States for the prevention and treatment of 
child abuse and neglect and includes a re-
quirement that in every case a GAL must be 
appointed to represent the best interest of 
the child; 
Whereas such GAL requirement was subse-
quently amended to provide that the GAL 
may be an attorney or a court-appointed spe-
cial advocate; 
Whereas, today, CASA and GAL volunteers 
span 49 States and the District of Columbia, 
including 950 State organizations and local 
programs, and more than 94,000 volunteers 
offer their services to nearly 250,000 children, 
youth, and families; and 
Whereas 2022 marks the 40th anniversary of 
the National CSA/GAL Association for Chil-
dren: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 6, 2022, as ‘‘National 
CASA/GAL Volunteers’ Day’’; and 
(2) commends CASA and GAL volunteers 
for their dedication and hard work in advo-
cating for the best interests of children so 
that every child who has experienced abuse 
or neglect can be safe, have a permanent 
home, and have the opportunity to thrive.
