PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Light of the world, shine Your love 
on us this day. Break forth into the 
darkness of our world with Your truth 
and illuminate the paths You would 
have us take as we move through this 
day. 
Make visible to us Your abiding pres-
ence, that in the certainty of Your 
company we would be more willing to 
go forth, step up, and speak Your life- 
giving word into the uncertainty of 
these times. 
Reveal to us Your redeeming will, 
that we would receive the righteous-
ness You offer us. May our personal ho-
liness be grounded in humility and mo-
tivated by our desire to serve You. 
Thus, 
may 
Your 
light 
shine 
unobscured through our renewed com-
mitment to this world, our country, 
and Your people. May we have the eyes 
to see those who are in need, and may 
our lives reflect the warmth of Your 
light on those who hide in despair. 
This day, may our words, our deeds, 
and our relationships one with another, 
be a witness to Your light and Your 
love. 
In the gift of Your revealed name we 
pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. DEAN led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
CONGRATULATING CHILDREN’S 
HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
gratulate and thank the Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia on the opening 
of their second inpatient hospital, in 
my district, in King of Prussia. 
CHOP’s Middleman Family Pavilion 
will dedicate more than 250,000 square 
feet of space solely to children. In our 
continued fight with COVID–19, we 
need more facilities like this one that 
families from all over our region can 
access. 
As the first pediatric emergency 
room in Montgomery County, CHOP 
will ensure that more children in Penn-
sylvania will have timely, nationally 
acclaimed care. 
The Middleman Family Pavilion will 
also create many jobs for the Mont-
gomery County community, bringing 
needed jobs to communities like Nor-
ristown, 
Bridgeport, 
and 
Conshohocken. 
Now more than ever, with CHOP, it is 
all about children. That is the same for 
me. We need healthcare facilities that 
meet the demands of today, that treat 
our children with expert care and our 
families with compassion. Congratula-
tions to CHOP. 
A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN A YEAR 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
a lot can happen in a year: a woman 
can deliver a newborn; a child can 
learn to walk; and a small virus leaked 
from a lab in Wuhan, China, can go 
around the globe and cause a global 
pandemic. 
While the first two are joyous, the 
latter, and the 1-year anniversary of 
the Biden administration, is nothing to 
celebrate. We have the highest infla-
tion in 40 years, and you don’t need a 
graph to show that. We see it each day 
when we go to fill up our tank or go to 
the grocery store. 
We have the end of American energy 
independence and a plea to OPEC to in-
crease petroleum production; record- 
high numbers of illegal border cross-
ings; almost double legal immigration, 
with no COVID–19 testing; record-high 
illegal drug crossings, especially syn-
thetic 
fentanyl, 
with 
record-high 
overdoses, especially in our young pop-
ulation, 18 to 45; record-high homicides 
and crime in blue States; a disastrous 
withdrawal from Afghanistan, Saigon 
2.0, with a loss of billions in equipment 
and the lives of 13 of our servicemen 
and -women. 
The disastrous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan has led to increased insta-
bility with Russia and China. 
We have a vaccine mandate that ig-
nores science, which shows that both 
the delta virus can transmit, even if 
vaccinated and boosted, and omicron 
wanes within 1 month. 
My advice to this administration: 
End the vaccine mandate; stop what 
you are doing; and go on vacation.

SUPPORTING 
CONGRESSIONAL 
GOLD MEDAL FOR IRAN HOS-
TAGES 
(Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the award of a Congressional 
Gold Medal to the 52 hostages of the 
Iran hostage crisis that were released, 
after 444 days of captivity, 41 years ago 
today. 
On November 4, 1979, Iranian student 
militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran and took Embassy employees 
captive. Despite mock firing squads, 
beatings, solitary confinement, lack of 
food, and psychological torture, the 
American hostages maintained their 
strength and resilience. 
Back at home, Americans remained 
united in their support for the hos-
tages, 
many 
tying 
yellow 
ribbons 
around trees as a sign of solidarity. 
The former hostages have never re-
ceived proper recognition from their 
government for their sacrifices. 
This bipartisan bill is a symbol of our 
Nation’s ability to come together to 
honor these American heroes. As of 
today, the bill has over 166 cosponsors. 
Special thanks to Commission 52 and 
Chairman Brock Pierce for helping to 
gather support for the bill. It is a true 
public service. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN DRAGGING 
COUNTRY BACKWARD 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, this week marks 1 year of President 
Biden’s out-of-touch, reckless, and dis-
astrous Presidency. 
The past 12 months have been filled 
with failure after failure, and Ameri-
cans are dealing with the consequences 
at every corner. 
From 
skyrocketing 
inflation, 
in-
creased crime rates, a disastrous Af-
ghanistan exit, an open border agenda, 
concerned parents labeled as domestic 
terrorists, and more, this administra-
tion has failed the American people. 
Amidst 
all 
the 
crises, 
President 
Biden has spent a quarter of his first 
year in his Delaware basement, avoid-
ing all responsibilities. This is unac-
ceptable from anyone. 
I came to Congress to serve the peo-
ple of Texas’ 25th Congressional Dis-
trict, and when I am back home, I hear 
firsthand how Texans are worse off 
under President Biden than ever be-
fore. 
The bottom line is, a year of the 
Biden administration’s socialist and 
far-left agenda has dragged our country 
backward, not forward. 
It is time America has leaders that 
put America first. President Joe Biden 
is not that leader. He has 33 percent ap-
proval. 
In God we trust. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
STANTON). Members are reminded to re-
frain from engaging in personalities to-
ward the President. 
f 
CELEBRATING FEDERAL FUNDING 
TO 
EXPAND 
HOUSTON 
SHIP 
CHANNEL 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the Federal dol-
lars coming to the Houston area to 
solve the supply chain issues facing our 
community and to create more jobs. 
Yesterday, the Biden administration 
announced over $14 billion for projects 
that will improve our Nation’s ports, 
waterways, and railroads. That in-
cludes $147 million for a project to ex-
pand the Houston Ship Channel on the 
way to the Port of Houston. 
This project will make it easier for 
ships to reach the docks and help more 
cargo move faster from the container 
ship to the store shelf. This will create 
jobs, jobs, and more jobs. This is huge 
for Texas, huge for Houston, and huge 
for the whole country. 
Thanks to the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act passed by this 
Chamber, we are solving the real prob-
lems facing everyday Americans. 
I am grateful for the leadership of 
President Biden and my colleagues in 
Congress for getting this done. 
f 
REPUBLICANS WILLING TO WORK 
WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I lis-
tened last night to President Biden’s 
press 
conference, 
and 
I 
was 
dis-
appointed that he felt the Republicans 
did not want to work with him. 
I would like to open the door, first of 
all, to working together to balance the 
budget. We don’t consider it a goal of 
ours to race to get to $30 trillion in 
debt. 
Please, Mr. Biden, convene a group of 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats. 
Let’s 
work together to balance the budget. 
Secondly, prior to you taking office, 
it was routine that about 20,000 people 
per month came across the border. 
Now, we are at over 80,000. 
I secondly ask that we convene a bi-
partisan group to get back down to 
20,000 a month to cross the border. 
Finally, at the time President Trump 
was President, he was given a cocktail 
which cured his COVID illness almost 
immediately. That cocktail should be 
available to all Americans. 
I, again, encourage a joint conference 
with us to get together and cure the 
people who get COVID. 
Finally, Mr. President, stop being so 
divisive and screaming racism right 
and left. It does no good for this body 
to constantly call racism. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
IMPROVING MERRILL AND RING 
CREEK BRIDGE 
(Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, people have been traveling 
across the Merrill and Ring Creek 
Bridge in Everett, Washington, since 
Herbert Hoover was President of the 
United States. 
Every day, residents drive, walk, 
pedal, and roll across the bridge to get 
to and from work and school in Everett 
and to catch a ferry in Mukilteo. Com-
muters on Everett Transit’s route 18 
bus rely on the bridge to access Sound-
er commuter rail and Amtrak service 
at Everett Station. 
However, a recent assessment re-
vealed the bridge is not only struc-
turally deficient; it is vulnerable to 
collapse in the event of an earthquake. 
Thanks to the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law, Washington communities will 
receive more than $605 million over the 
next 5 years to invest in critical bridge 
repairs. 
Last week, Everett officials took me 
across the Merrill and Ring Creek 
Bridge and told me how this bold, long- 
term investment will create jobs, drive 
economic recovery, and keep people on 
the move. 
Mr. Speaker, you cannot have a big- 
league economy with little-league in-
frastructure. Thanks to the bipartisan 
infrastructure law, communities in my 
district now have the resources needed 
to repair aging bridges and build a win-
ning game plan for the region’s eco-
nomic future. 
f 
RECOGNIZING STETSON BENNETT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor and recognize 
one of the First District’s finest, quar-
terback Stetson Bennett of the Georgia 
Bulldogs. 
Football is filled with stories of tri-
umph, tribulation, and heart. The saga 
of Stetson Bennett has now cemented 
itself as one of those great stories that 
football fans will talk about for gen-
erations. 
Hailing from Blackshear, Georgia, in 
Pierce County, Stetson Bennett grew 
up with a dream and a drive to turn 
that dream into reality. 
As a young quarterback at Pierce 
County High School, Stetson was able 
to accumulate 3,700 passing yards, 500 
rushing yards, and 40 touchdowns, 
along with Class 3A second team all- 
State honors. 
Despite 
his 
accomplishments, 
Stetson was overlooked by many top 
football programs, but he never gave 
up the dream and walked on at the 
University of Georgia. 
Following his freshman year, he 
chose to transfer to a junior college,

where he went 10–2 and won a cham-
pionship. He returned to the University 
of Georgia his junior year and earned a 
starting role. 
This past season, Stetson Bennett 
spearheaded the Dawgs to their first 
college football national championship 
in 42 years. The dream has become re-
ality. 
Stetson inspires me and will inspire 
others for many years to come. 
Congratulations, and go Dawgs.

HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER 
BOBBY REED 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today, we 
honor the life and memory of Officer 
Bobby Reed. 
He was born November 23, 1951, and 
Bobby Reed’s life was about service to 
his community and to his country. 
As a marine, he was deployed over-
seas to Vietnam, where he served hon-
orably and attained the rank of staff 
sergeant. 
When he returned home to Santa 
Ana, California, my hometown, he de-
cided to join the local police depart-
ment to continue protecting and serv-
ing his community. 
During his 28 years of service on the 
Santa Ana police force, Officer Reed 
was honored many times over by his 
colleagues and his community for his 
exemplary service and character. Mul-
tiple 
civic 
organizations, 
such 
as 
Kiwanis and MADD, recognized him 
with many awards. 
He was also elected as a board mem-
ber of the Santa Ana Police Officers 
Association, showing, again, his leader-
ship and his positive influence on oth-
ers. 
As we celebrate Bobby’s life, may his 
example continue to shine for the next 
generation.

SPEAKER PHELAN SETS THE BAR 
HIGH 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the 76th 
Speaker of the Texas House of Rep-
resentatives, 
Representative 
Dade 
Phelan of Beaumont, Texas. 
Speaker Phelan, who is serving his 
fourth term representing the great Dis-
trict 21, is one of the most conservative 
Speakers in our State’s history and has 
made it his priority to significantly 
improve the lives of Texans every sin-
gle day. 
As only the fourth Republican to 
hold the Texas House Speakership 
since 1871, or 151 years, he has set the 
bar high for any who might follow in 
his footsteps. He fought to pass land-
mark legislation that protects busi-
nesses, taxpayers, the unborn, religious 
freedoms, and our Second Amendment 
rights. 
Under 
his 
leadership, 
the 
Texas 
House led on criminal justice reform 
issues, healthcare affordability, police 
funding, and addressing winter storm 
Uri’s long-term impact on our State. 
I cannot express how proud we are in 
Texas 14 to claim Speaker Phelan, his 
wife Kim, and their four precious boys, 
Ford, Mack, Hank, and little Luke, as 
our own. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Phelan 
for all he does for Texas.

ENSURING VETERANS’ SMOOTH 
TRANSITION ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 860, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 4673) to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to provide for the 
automatic enrollment of eligible vet-
erans in patient enrollment system of 
Department of Veterans Affairs, and 
for other purposes, and ask for its im-
mediate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

ant to House Resolution 860, an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 117–26 is adopted, and the bill, as 
amended, is considered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as

H.R. 4673 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled. 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

The gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) and the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. BOST) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
4673, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4673, as amended, my bill, the 
Ensuring Veterans’ Smooth Transition, 
or EVEST Act. 
I have made suicide prevention a top 
priority for the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee. Last Congress, we passed 
bipartisan, bicameral mental health 
legislative 
packages, 
including 
the 
Commander John Scott Hannon Vet-
erans Mental Health Improvement Act 
and the Veterans COMPACT Act. This 
Congress, we continued this work by 
passing the Sergeant Ketchum Rural 
Veterans Mental Health Act into law, 
but there is always more to do. 
EVEST builds on our work and fi-
nally closes one of the most glaring 
gaps for veterans being able to success-
fully access high-quality VA health 
services, the enrollment process. We 
shouldn’t be trying to hide VA care 
from those who earned it. 
We know that the months following 
transition out of the military can be 
very stressful and particularly risky 
for new veterans in terms of mental 
health. With the EVEST Act, service-
members will be automatically en-
rolled in VA care during their transi-
tion out of the military, with the 
choice to opt out. This helps simplify 
the process and prevents veterans from 
potentially missing out on lifesaving 
care. It also keeps veterans from hav-
ing to opt into VA care later and at-
tempt to navigate a new bureaucracy 
all on their own. 
The symptoms of PTSD can be sig-
nificantly improved in veterans who re-
ceive prompt mental healthcare. A 2014 
study led by researchers at the San 
Francisco VA Medical Center looked at 
nearly 40,000 Iraq and Afghanistan vet-
erans 
who 
received

January 20, 2022 
healthcare between 2001 and 2011 and 
had a post-deployment diagnosis of 
PTSD. They found that veterans who 
sought and received care soon after the 
end of their service had lower levels of 
PTSD upon follow-up a year after they 
initiated care. Each year that a vet-
eran waited to initiate treatment, 
there was about a 5 percent increase in 
the odds of their PTSD either not im-
proving or getting worse. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the study from the San Francisco VA 
Medical Center. 
[From Psychiatric Services, Dec. 2014] 
TIMING OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND 
PTSD SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT AMONG IRAQ 
AND AFGHANISTAN VETERANS 
(By Shira Maguen, Ph.D.; Erin Madden, 
M.P.H.; Thomas C. Neylan, M.D.; Beth E. 
Cohen, M.D., M.A.S.; Daniel Bertenthal, 
M.P.H.; Karen H. Seal, M.D., M.P.H.) 
OBJECTIVE 
This study examined demographic, mili-
tary, temporal, and logistic variables associ-
ated with improvement of posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) among Iraq and Af-
ghanistan veterans who received mental 
health outpatient treatment from the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health 
care system. The authors sought to deter-
mine whether time between last deployment 
and initiating mental health treatment was 
associated with a lack of improvement in 
PTSD symptoms. 
METHODS 
The authors conducted a retrospective 
analysis of existing medical records of Iraq 
and Afghanistan veterans who enrolled in 
VA health care, received a postdeployment 
PTSD diagnosis, and initiated treatment for 
one or more mental health problems between 
October 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, and 
whose records contained results of PTSD 
screening at the start of treatment and ap-
proximately one year later (N=39,690). 
RESULTS 
At the start of treatment, 75% of veterans 
diagnosed as having PTSD had a positive 
PTSD screen. At follow-up, 27% of those with 
a positive screen at baseline had improved, 
and 43% of those with a negative screen at 
baseline remained negative. 
A 
negative 
PTSD screen at follow-up was associated 
with female gender, older age, white race, 
having never married, officer rank, non- 
Army service, closer proximity to the near-
est VA facility, and earlier initiation of 
treatment after the end of the last deploy-
ment. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Interventions to reduce delays in initiating 
mental health treatment may improve vet-
erans’ treatment response. Further studies 
are needed to test interventions for par-
ticular veteran subgroups who were less like-
ly than others to improve with treatment. 
(Psychiatric Services 65:1414–1419, 2014; doi: 
10.1176/appi.ps.201300453) 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is 
one of the most common mental disorders 
among veterans returning from recent de-
ployments. Yet, despite the availability of 
evidence-based treatments, there are mul-
tiple barriers to initiating mental health 
treatment. Many military personnel and vet-
erans who report barriers to mental health 
care do not seek treatment or postpone seek-
ing it. 
Among veterans who do seek mental 
health care, the time lag is quite significant. 
In a previous study, we found that recently 
returning veterans with psychiatric diag-
noses had delayed initiating mental health 
care at the U.S. Department of Veterans Af-
fairs (VA) by a median of over two years 
after their last deployment ended. Delays in 
care can translate into delays in symptom 
and functional improvement, hindering read-
justment to civilian life, family, and commu-
nity. 
Some studies have examined predictors of 
PTSD symptom worsening, but outside of 
randomized treatment trials, only a few 
studies have examined variables that are as-
sociated with PTSD symptom improvement. 
In other words, few studies have examined 
variables that are associated with PTSD 
symptom improvement in a naturalistic 
fashion, by allowing treatment initiation or 
engagement to vary among participants. 
Furthermore, even fewer studies have exam-
ined these questions among military per-
sonnel or veterans, particularly among those 
who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ex-
isting studies have found a few variables 
that were associated with PTSD symptom 
improvement. For example, service members 
serving 
in 
multiple 
deployments 
dem-
onstrated greater symptom improvement 
than those serving in a single deployment. 
For other demographic variables, the asso-
ciation with improvement is unclear. For ex-
ample, although we know that female gender 
may be associated with the development of 
PTSD, it is not clear how gender is related 
to PTSD symptom improvement. 
If we can better understand why some indi-
viduals improve, we can better understand 
the course and trajectories of PTSD and how 
to best contribute to individuals’ recovery. 
This study evaluated demographic, military, 
temporal, and logistic variables that may be 
associated with PTSD symptom improve-
ment. We were particularly interested in 
whether seeking mental health treatment 
sooner was associated with improvement in 
PTSD symptoms. 
METHODS 
Data source and extraction 
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 
existing medical records from the VA’s Oper-
ation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation 
Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation New Dawn 
(OND) roster, a national database of veterans 
who have separated from OEF/OIF/OND mili-
tary service and who have enrolled in VA 
health care. Veterans of OEF served pre-
dominantly in Afghanistan, and veterans of 
OIF and OND served predominantly in Iraq. 
We linked the OEF/OIF/OND roster database, 
which contains veterans’ demographic and 
military service information, to the Decision 
Support System’s National Data Extract of 
pharmacy data and the VA National Patient 
Care Database, which provides VA visit dates 
and associated diagnostic codes from the 
International 
Classification 
of 
Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD– 
9–CM). These data are derived from elec-
tronic medical records generated during clin-
ical visits. Visits to mental health out-
patient and primary care services are cat-
egorized by clinic stop codes. Mental health 
outpatient services include visits to inte-
grated care clinics providing primary care 
and mental health care. Fee basis codes des-
ignate care that is rendered at non-VA facili-
ties and reimbursed by the VA but do not 
capture all non-VA care, such as care reim-
bursed by private insurance. The results of 
PTSD screening were extracted from the VA 
Corporate Data Warehouse. 
All analyses were restricted to OEF/OIF/ 
OND veterans who had received a diagnosis 
of PTSD (ICD–9–CM code 309.81) during two 
or more clinical encounters that occurred 
after the end of their last deployment and 
before December 31, 2012; had utilized mental 
health outpatient care between October 1, 
2007 (beginning of nationwide primary care 
screenings), and December 31, 2012, and had 
not made any prior use of VA care; and had 
received PTSD screenings at both the start 
of treatment (up to three months before and 
one month after the first mental health 
visit) and on at least one other occasion oc-
curring at least one year later (N=39,690). Of 
veterans who newly entered mental health 
treatment, 83% had a baseline screen for 
PTSD, and of those with a baseline screen, 
50% had a follow-up screen during the period 
beginning one year later. The follow-up 
screen that was closest in proximity to the 
one-year follow-up date was utilized. 
Measures 
PTSD symptoms were assessed by using 
the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD), 
the PTSD Checklist (PCL), or both. Both 
measures were included in order to capture 
the most representative sample, given that 
the PC-PTSD screen is mainly used in VA 
primary care settings and other non-mental 
health settings and the PCL is used pri-
marily in VA mental health settings. The 
PC-PTSD, a brief four-item screen given an-
nually and after each deployment, is de-
signed to detect possible PTSD symptoms. 
The screen yields binary responses (yes or 
no) for each of four PTSD symptom clusters: 
reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numb-
ing, and hyperarousal; a score of ≥3 des-
ignates a positive PTSD screen for veterans. 
The PCL is a 17-item measure, with each 
item rating the presence of a different symp-
tom over the past month on a 5-point Likert 
scale, from not at all to a little bit, mod-
erately, quite a bit, and extremely. The PCL 
has been shown to have very good internal 
consistency, and it correlates strongly with 
other measures of PTSD symptoms. The PCL 
also demonstrates high diagnostic efficiency 
(.90). Within the VA, the PCL is mainly ad-
ministered at the discretion of treating cli-
nicians, typically to track patient progress 
during the course of mental health treat-
ment. For the purposes of this study, symp-
toms rated as moderately or above on the 
PCL were considered present. PTSD symp-
toms from the PCL were combined in order 
to create indicators that paralleled each of 
the four symptom cluster proxies from the 
PC-PTSD. The validity of the mapping of 
PCL questions onto PC-PTSD items was 
tested by examining concordance between 
the two screens given at the VA on the same 
date. For the purposes of validation, all OEF/ 
OIF/OND veterans who were administered 
the PCL and the PC-PTSD on the same date 
(not restricted to our study sample) were in-
cluded (N=53,756), with a total of 57,889 in-
stances in which a given veteran had both a 
PC-PTSD and PCL administered on the same 
day. [A table describing the mapping of the 
PCL to the PC-PTSD and agreement between 
the two instruments is available online as a 
data supplement to this article.] 
We created a composite variable, referred 
to as the PTSD screen result; endorsing 
three or more symptoms on either measure 
constituted a positive screen for PTSD. 
Dependent variable 
The binary dependent variable, a negative 
(versus positive) PTSD screen result, was de-
fined as a score of <3 at follow-up on the 
PTSD screen. This outcome comprised PTSD 
screen results that had improved or had re-
mained negative compared with baseline re-
sults (versus having worsened or remained 
positive). 
Independent variables 
The main independent variable was time 
until initiation of mental health outpatient 
treatment, which was defined for each person 
as the time (in years) from the end of the 
last deployment until the first mental health

outpatient visit. Other independent variables 
included date of birth, gender, race-eth-
nicity, marital status, and military charac-
teristics. Details about each person’s mili-
tary characteristics (armed forces branch 
[Army, Marines, Navy or Coast Guard, or Air 
Force], rank, component type [National 
Guard and reserves or active duty], and num-
ber of deployments [one or multiple deploy-
ments]) were extracted from the OEF/OIF/ 
OND roster. Information about the type of 
VA facility nearest to the individual and the 
distance to the closest facility was derived 
from the OEF/OIF/OND roster by the VA 
planning and system support group. 
The following independent variables were 
treated as potential confounders because 
each could account for change in PTSD 
symptoms: mental health outpatient treat-
ment utilization, defined as the number of 
mental health clinic visits between the start 
of mental health treatment and the follow- 
up screen; regular use of primary care serv-
ices, defined as a mean interval between vis-
its of six months or fewer; and use of a selec-
tive serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for 
12 consecutive weeks or more, as encoded in 
VA outpatient pharmacy data. 
Analysis 
We used logistic regression analysis to ex-
amine the association of independent pre-
dictor variables with a negative PTSD screen 
result. In separate logistic regression mod-
els, we examined predictors of PTSD screen 
results for each of the four PTSD symptom 
clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, emo-
tional numbing, and hyperarousal). The 
main predictors of interest included time 
from the end of the last deployment to initi-
ation of mental health outpatient treatment, 
gender, age, race-ethnicity, marital status, 
military component, rank, branch, number 
of deployments, and distance to and type of 
nearest VA facility. The multi-variable anal-
ysis adjusted for potential confounders of the 
association between changes in PTSD symp-
toms and predictors. Potential confounders 
included baseline PTSD screen result, timing 
of follow-up screen, regular utilization of 
primary care services, total mental health 
outpatient treatment utilization, and SSRI 
use. Primary care and mental health service 
utilization and antidepressant use were in-
cluded only for adjustment purposes because 
of potential biases due to confounding by in-
dication. More specifically, persons who are 
more symptomatic are more likely to utilize 
health services and antidepressant medica-
tions. 
We tested interactions of demographic and 
military predictors with each other and, sep-
arately, with time to initiation of mental 
health outpatient treatment. As mentioned 
above, the study combined results for vet-
erans whose PTSD screen result had im-
proved from baseline with those for veterans 
whose screen result had remained negative. 
To determine whether it was valid to com-
bine these scores, we tested interactions of 
baseline screen results with demographic and 
military factors and, separately, with time 
from the end of the last deployment to initi-
ation of mental health outpatient treatment. 
All tests were two-tailed. Analyses were per-
formed by using SAS, version 9.3. The study 
was approved by the Committee on Human 
Research, 
University 
of 
California, 
San 
Francisco, and the San Francisco VA Med-
ical Center. 
RESULTS 
The sample was 90% male, with a mean±SD 
age of 30.5±8.16; 57% were white, 11% were 
black, 11% were Hispanic, and 21% were of 
other or unknown race-ethnicity. At the 
time of initiation of mental health out-
patient treatment, 75% of the veterans 
screened positive for PTSD, having endorsed 
at least three of the four PTSD symptom 
clusters on the PTSD screen (Table 1). After 
at least one year (mean follow-up=2.37±.93 
years), 27% (N=7,908) of those with a positive 
screen at baseline had improved, and 43% 
(N=4,329) of those with a negative screen at 
baseline continued to screen negative. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis 
showed that the following characteristics 
were associated with a negative PTSD screen 
result: women compared with men, older 
versus younger age at first mental health 
outpatient visit, officer rank compared with 
enlisted rank, service in branches of the 
military other than the Army, and negative 
PTSD screen at baseline (Table 2). 
Blacks were less likely than whites to have 
a negative screen result (Table 2), and this 
difference persisted after adjustment for 
time from the end of the last deployment to 
mental health outpatient treatment. Similar 
to findings of previous studies, the median 
interval between the end of the last deploy-
ment and the use of services was about three 
months longer for blacks than for whites 
(p<.001; data not shown). The reduced likeli-
hood among blacks versus whites of a nega-
tive PTSD screen result was partly driven by 
the 7% greater probability that blacks would 
screen positive for PTSD at follow-up after 
having screened negative at baseline (p<.001; 
results not shown). 
Veterans who were married were slightly 
less likely than those who were never mar-
ried to have a negative PTSD screen result. 
Veterans who lived more than ten miles 
away from the nearest VA facility were less 
likely than veterans who lived closer to have 
a negative screen result. Veterans who lived 
closer to a community-based outpatient clin-
ic than to a VA medical center were also less 
likely to have a negative screen result. 
Notably, veterans who waited longer to 
initiate mental health outpatient treatment 
were less likely to have a negative screen re-
sult. Figure 1 illustrates the decreasing prob-
ability of a negative screen result with each 
year that passed after the end of the last de-
ployment. 
Logistic regression analyses found similar 
patterns of association between predictor 
variables and PTSD screen results for each 
of the four PTSD symptom clusters (results 
not shown). 
DISCUSSION 
A number of demographic, military, tem-
poral, and logistic variables were associated 
with symptom improvement or with con-
tinuing to score below the threshold for a 
positive PTSD screen. Although temporal 
variables are rarely examined, we found that 
greater time to mental health outpatient 
treatment engagement was negatively asso-
ciated with PTSD symptom improvement. 
More 
specifically, 
veterans 
who 
waited 
longer to get mental health treatment were 
less likely than veterans who sought treat-
ment sooner to experience PTSD symptom 
improvement during the study period. This 
finding sheds light on the importance of con-
tinuing to better understand barriers to 
mental health treatment, particularly given 
that less than half of veterans with mental 
health problems seek care and those who 
seek care do so after significant delays. 
Outreach efforts to help veterans engage in 
treatment in a timely manner are critical 
and may, in turn, help with PTSD symptom 
improvement over time. Intervening early 
when mental health problems are first de-
tected should be a priority. Given that inte-
grated primary and mental health care is 
now becoming available at many VA health 
care facilities, this ‘‘one-stop shop’’ model 
provides an optimal way to decrease time to 
seeking mental health care. Veterans in pri-
mary care who screen positive for any men-
tal health problems can receive immediate 
mental health assistance within an inte-
grated care model, which may assist with 
the stigma of receiving care in a mental 
health setting. Indeed, veterans who received 
integrated primary care were more likely to 
receive a mental health evaluation or care 
within a month. 
We also found that female gender was asso-
ciated with greater PTSD symptom improve-
ment compared with male gender. Although 
civilian studies found that females are at 
greater risk of PTSD, findings in military 
samples have been mixed, with some studies 
finding no gender differences. In addition, we 
recently found that although both genders 
experienced a delay in engaging in mini-
mally adequate mental health care (eight 
mental health outpatient visits within a 
year), female veterans received minimally 
adequate mental health care about two years 
sooner than male veterans, which may ex-
plain why they achieved greater symptom 
improvement. 
Black veterans were less likely, but only 
modestly so, to demonstrate PTSD symptom 
improvement, compared with their white 
counterparts, and this difference was not ex-
plained by longer time from the end of the 
last deployment to mental health outpatient 
treatment initiation. That is not surprising, 
given that studies have consistently found 
that unmet treatment needs are greatest in 
underserved groups, including racial-ethnic 
minority groups). It may be that veterans 
from racial-ethnic minority groups face par-
ticular barriers to treatment that are impor-
tant to acknowledge, and more research is 
needed in this area in order to optimize out-
comes. Furthermore, other variables, such as 
differential rates of traumatic stressors and 
preexisting conditions, are important to fur-
ther explore and may explain some of these 
differences. 
Officers were more likely than enlisted 
personnel to experience PTSD symptom im-
provement. One possible explanation is that 
officer status may be a proxy for higher edu-
cation; research has shown that lower levels 
of education are associated with chronic tra-
jectories of PTSD. However, other variables 
that we were not able to measure, such as so-
cial support in the aftermath of trauma, may 
also explain some of these findings. 
A number of limitations should be consid-
ered when interpreting these findings. First, 
this study was conducted with a population 
of treatment-seeking veterans who had at 
least one visit to a VA health care facility. 
Therefore, our results should not be general-
ized to all OEF/OIF/OND military personnel 
or veterans. Second, we selected a population 
of veterans who served in support of OEF/ 
OIF/OND, 
and, 
therefore, 
these 
results 
should not be generalized to veterans of 
other eras or to veterans from other coun-
tries. Third, ICD–9–CM diagnoses were ac-
quired from administrative health records 
and were not verified with standardized diag-
nostic measures. A related concern is the 
combined use of two separate validated 
tools, the PCL and the PC-PTSD. We used 
both the PCL and the PC-PTSD in order to 
obtain the most representative sample and 
because they are the measures used by the 
VA system. Furthermore, we found that the 
method we used was statistically reliable. 
Nonetheless, combining two separate vali-
dated tools may have resulted in variations 
in these data. Future studies should con-
tinue to examine the validity and reliability 
of this method. 
Fourth, because of the ways in which data 
appear in the VA administrative database, 
we were not able to distinguish between the 
types of mental health treatments that vet-
erans were receiving, such as evidence-based 
treatment for PTSD or other mental health

problems versus supportive therapy; rather, 
we could account only for number of visits. 
We hope to have better indicators of evi-
dence-based treatment for PTSD in the fu-
ture so that the particular types of care that 
veterans receive can be examined more 
closely in relation to symptom improve-
ment. Fifth, because we used administrative 
data, we were not able to examine third vari-
ables that may be associated with our out-
come, including severe avoidance symptoms, 
interpersonal difficulties, and poor attach-
ment, among others. Finally, we were able to 
include only veterans whose PTSD symp-
toms were measured during at least two oc-
casions; those who dropped out after one 
visit are not as well represented. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Veterans who waited longer to get mental 
health treatment were less likely to experi-
ence PTSD symptom improvement during 
the study period. Furthermore, improving 
barriers for black, male, younger, rural, 
lower-ranking, and possibly less well edu-
cated veterans is an important priority, 
given our findings. Models that integrate pri-
mary care and mental health care may be an 
optimal way to help expedite veteran treat-
ment engagement.

Mr. TAKANO. A smooth care transi-
tion from DOD to VA can help support 
veterans as they adjust to the next 
phase of their lives and provide easy 
access to healthcare should any chal-
lenges arise. 
Everyday Americans find it difficult 
and 
frustrating 
to 
sign 
up 
for 
healthcare. Now, imagine that you 
have just come off Active-Duty mili-
tary service where, for years you were 
told when and where to show up for 
your healthcare. You probably heard 
something about VA services during 
your transition assistance program 
but, frankly, you were focused on ev-
erything you had to do to finalize your 
separation from the military and pos-
sibly looking for new employment and 
relocating your family. 
Now, after having separated from the 
military, you are a veteran, and maybe 
for the first time you have to figure 
out how to check your eligibility for 
VA healthcare and navigate the system 
while potentially also facing some new 
stress in your personal and family life. 
This is completely avoidable with 
EVEST, which simply enrolls you in 
the VA healthcare for which you are 
already eligible, ensuring that when 
you need VA, there aren’t any unneces-
sary roadblocks to seeing a doctor. 
Now, let me say that again. This leg-
islation has nothing to do with a vet-
eran’s eligibility, nor does it change 
VA standards or who is eligible. It only 
connects eligible veterans to VA care 
faster and easier. 
We know that veterans are much 
more likely to use VA services and care 
when the process to enroll is simple, 
and we know that VA care is world 
class. EVEST is a straightforward tool 
that will allow us to simplify the tran-
sition process and take steps toward 
preventing veteran suicide. 
Automatic enrollment is something 
policymakers and veterans service or-
ganizations and stakeholders have been 
trying to advance for years, and with 
EVEST it will finally become a reality. 
Paralyzed Veterans of America and 
Disabled American Veterans have for-
mally endorsed this legislation. The 
Nurses Organization of Veterans Af-
fairs, the American Federation of Gov-
ernment 
Employees, 
the 
Veterans 
Healthcare Policy Institute, and the 
American Psychological Association 
also support EVEST. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
letters of support from the 
Nurses Organization of Veterans Af-
fairs and the Veterans Healthcare Pol-
icy Institute. 
NURSES ORGANIZATION OF 
VETERANS AFFAIRS, 
January 14, 2021. 
Chairman MARK TAKANO, 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN TAKANO: On behalf of the 
nearly 3,000 members of the Nurses Organiza-
tion of Veterans Affairs (NOVA) we would 
like to offer our strong support for your bill, 
H.R. 4673, Ensuring Veterans’ Smooth Tran-
sition Act (EVEST). 
As nurses, caring for Veterans is our num-
ber one priority. Your bill will provide Vet-
erans with the option of enrolling in VA 
healthcare during the critical months fol-
lowing their transition to civilian life and 
ensure servicemembers separating from ac-
tive duty receive the critical health care to 
which they are eligible. 
Your bill will also help eliminate barriers 
to care—including those who may not know 
they are even eligible to receive care at VA. 
It will also help to assure the Veteran that 
they are not alone in seeking care for any 
physical or mental health condition acquired 
during their military service. 
Offering automatic enrollment with an opt 
out will help to lessen the burden of navi-
gating the VA healthcare system at a time 
when they are dealing with many challenges 
as they transition to civilian life. 
NOVA believes that most Veterans will 
find care provided them within the VA is 
suited to their individual and complex needs 
and cannot be matched in the private sector. 
Many providers at the VA are Veterans 
themselves so they understand what it 
means to serve and are trained to provide a 
Whole Health approach to the Veteran pa-
tients’ health and well-being. 
Thank you for your leadership on this 
issue and your continued support for Vet-
erans and the healthcare professionals who 
care for them. 
Sincerely, 
TARYN-JANAE WILCOX- 
OLSON, MHS, RN,

ganization of Vet-

VETERANS HEALTHCARE 
POLICY INSTITUTE (VHPI), 
January 19, 2022. 
Endorsement of the ‘‘Ensuring Veterans’ 
Smooth Transition Act’’ 
The Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute 
(VHPI) is pleased to formally endorse House 
bill H.R. 4673, the ‘‘Ensuring Veterans’ 
Smooth Transition Act’’ or ‘‘EVEST Act.’’ 
The EVEST Act creates a process to auto-
matically enroll Veterans who are eligible, 
upon their discharge from the military, into 
the VA for medical care, with an opportunity 
to opt out. Many Veterans do not receive the 
health care they have earned through their 
service because they are unaware of their eli-
gibility or are too overwhelmed during the 
complex period of transitioning from active 
duty. By automatically enrolling Veterans 
into the VA system, many more eligible vet-
erans will be able to utilize valuable VA 
health care benefits. Many lives will be 
saved. 
This is one of the most important bills in 
many years, and we are pleased to support 
its passage. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
thank Speaker PELOSI
and Leader 
HOYER for considering this legislation 
today, and I urge the rest of my col-
leagues to support this vital legislation 
to increase access to care and ensure a 
smooth transition to civilian life for 
veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 4673, the Ensuring Vet-
erans’ Smooth Transition, or EVEST 
Act. 
This bill would require VA to auto-
matically enroll every eligible sepa-
rating servicemember into the VA 
healthcare system. As a veteran, I 
know firsthand that the transition 
from military to civilian life can be 
hard. One of the goals is to remove bar-
riers to care for veterans, whether they 
left the military decades ago or just 
last week. 
I believe the intention of the EVEST 
Act is to further that goal by con-
necting more at-risk servicemembers 
with the VA as they leave the service. 
I support the intention. I know many 
other Members do as well, which is why 
I expect the bill to pass the House, and 
probably on a bipartisan basis. 
However, as the ranking member of 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I 
have a different perspective on this bill 
than many of my colleagues. I have 
taken a long, hard look at this legisla-
tion, and what I have seen is a bill that 
may be well intended but has several 
potential problems. 
To start with, the EVEST Act enrolls 
separating servicemembers into the VA 
healthcare 
system 
without 
their 
knowledge or consent. Only after they 
have been enrolled does the bill require 
VA to inform the veterans of their en-
rollment, the status of their enroll-
ment, 
and 
how 
to 
opt 
out 
by 
disenrolling themselves. 
We shouldn’t be signing veterans up 
for a government program they aren’t 
asking for and may never need without 
at least letting them know first. And

January 20, 2022 
we shouldn’t be telling them that if 
they don’t like it, they can figure out 
how to disenroll themselves. That is 
backwards. 
Veterans deserve better than that. 
Veterans also deserve better than a bill 
that has been rushed through Congress 
without due diligence. There has never 
been a single hearing on the EVEST 
Act in this Congress. 
You may hear the chairman say that 
there has been a hearing on this bill 
last Congress. That is true. But last 
Congress and this Congress are very 
different. We had a different adminis-
tration last Congress; we had a dif-
ferent VA Secretary last Congress. I 
believe more than 70 Members are new 
this Congress. More than half of the 
membership of the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee is new as well. And, regard-
less, VA did not provide testimony at 
the hearing last Congress. 
We have no idea if VA can implement 
the bill without disrupting service to 
the veterans already in the VA health 
system, further burdening VA’s already 
overworked staff, or increasing the 
strain on VA’s already overfull facili-
ties. Every Member of the House hears 
from veterans in our districts who are 
waiting too long for care they need, 
stuck in crowded VA facilities, and 
being treated by VA staff who are 
struggling and overwhelmed. I am con-
cerned that this bill could make each 
of those things worse. 
I am not the only one who thinks so. 
Last week, right before this bill was 
considered by the Rules Committee, 
the Biden administration issued a 
Statement of Administration Policy on 
the EVEST Act. The statement reads, 
‘‘There 
may 
be 
challenges 
imple-
menting this bill as drafted, and the 
administration looks forward to work-
ing 
with 
Congress. . . .’’ 
In 
other 
words, even the President recognizes 
that this bill needs more work. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Statement of Administration Pol-
icy. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 1836—GUARD AND RESERVE GI BILL PARITY 
ACT OF 2021—REP. LEVIN, D–CALIFORNIA, AND 
NINE COSPONSORS 
H.R. 4673—ENSURING VETERANS’ SMOOTH TRAN-
SITION
(EVEST)
ACT—REP. TAKANO, D–CALI-
FORNIA 
The Biden-Harris Administration supports 
efforts that ensure veterans receive timely 
access to high-quality benefits and services 
that they have earned. 
The Administration supports H.R. 1836, 
which would expand eligibility criteria for 
certain education benefits. Current law de-
fines the term ‘‘active duty’’ as those indi-
viduals who are on full-time duty in the ac-
tive military service of the United States, 
including full-time training duty, annual 
training duty, and attendance, while in the 
active military service, at a school des-
ignated as a service school by law or by the 
Secretary of the military department con-
cerned. H.R. 1836 would expand eligibility 
criteria to include those training in full-time 
National Guard duty, which includes the Na-
tional Guard, the Army National Guard, and 
the Air National Guard, as well as those 
same members when performing active duty. 
The Administration supports the EVEST 
Act’s goal of seamless enrollment in health 
care coverage. As currently written, H.R. 
4673 would require the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs (VA) to automatically enroll 
new veterans into VA health care, and notify 
veterans of their enrollment and instruc-
tions on how to un-enroll, if desired. There 
may be challenges implementing this bill as 
drafted, and the Administration looks for-
ward to working with Congress on how best 
to operationalize its objective. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, to be clear, 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee had 
numerous opportunities in the last 
year to do that work that I had just 
discussed, and I don’t know why the 
chairman chose not to. I have heard 
him say over the last week that it is 
okay we didn’t have a hearing on the 
EVEST Act in this Congress because 
the bill has been in the public domain. 
Now, I am not sure what that state-
ment really means because there have 
been almost 400 bills introduced in this 
Congress that have been referred to the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I guess 
that each of those are in the public do-
main. But I don’t think any of them 
are ready for a vote here on the House 
floor. 
It is not too much to ask that we 
seek the input from stakeholders be-
fore voting on a bill to become law. 
That is actually the least we can do. I 
don’t think our constituents sent us 
here to do anything less than that. 
During last week’s Rules Committee, 
Congresswoman TORRES, a member of 
Chairman TAKANO’s own party, seemed 
to agree with me by lamenting the lack 
of process this bill has received this 
Congress. With all due respect to the 
Congresswoman, I doubt that we agree 
on much, but we do agree on this, 
though. Having this bill go through a 
much more robust process this Con-
gress could have resulted in a much 
better product for our veterans. 
b 0930 
Finally, I want to note that the bill 
will also cost taxpayers $3.1 billion in 
new discretionary spending. Not a 
penny of that $3.1 billion is offset. 
Implementing this bill will certainly 
require additional funding above the 
nearly $100 billion already appropriated 
for the VA healthcare system. 
We cannot keep saddling our children 
and grandchildren with billions of dol-
lars more debt. We have to do better 
than this. 
Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that I under-
stand why my colleagues will likely 
vote for this bill. I wish I could vote for 
this bill, as well. 
Leaving the military was not easy. It 
can leave new veterans feeling adrift 
and alone. I have been there. But that 
is why I supported efforts during the 
Trump administration to improve the 
Transition Assistance Program and in-
crease the VA’s outreach to separating 
servicemembers during their first year 
out of uniform. 
I want separating servicemembers 
who need additional support to be able 
to get it and the help they need in a 
seamless manner. And I am not at all 
confident that this bill will accomplish 
that goal without harming services to 
other veterans and adding to the na-
tional debt. As a result, I must oppose 
this bill today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I reiterate that we should not be hid-
ing the care that our veterans have 
earned. Let me quickly say that this 
bill has been in the public domain for 2 
years. It was reintroduced last sum-
mer, and the minority had over 6 
months to talk with us and the VA 
about it. 
Furthermore, the committee has held 
six hearings on suicide prevention and 
transition since 2019. The common 
sense of this bill shines through. 
And let me also add that regarding 
the capacity of VA—and I am glad that 
the ranking member has entered the 
statement of administrative support 
into the Record; that statement clearly 
says and declares the administration’s 
support and its willingness to work 
with the administration. 
Data shows that VA enrollment has 
been going down in recent years, and 
while new enrollment hovers around 
400,000 per year, it used to be double 
that, around one million per year, and 
using current assumptions, VA projects 
veteran enrollment in VHA to remain 
relatively steady from 2019 to 2029. 
I am very confident about VA’s abil-
ity to absorb the additional veterans 
that will take advantage of VA’s world- 
class healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN), 
my good friend and a member of the 
House Committee on Veterans Affairs 
and the chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Technology Modernization. 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. TAKANO for yielding me the time. 
It is my honor today to rise in sup-
port of H.R. 4673, the Ensuring Vet-
erans’ Smooth Transition Act. 
I appreciate the leadership of Chair-
man TAKANO to advance this critical 
legislation that will require the VA to 
automatically enroll individuals who 
are separating from the military into 
the VA system. 
Our brave members of the military 
put their lives and health on the line 
every day to keep our Nation safe, de-
fend our democracy, and protect our 
freedoms. 
We have a responsibility to make it 
as easy as possible for them to transi-
tion from military service to civilian 
life, and I am pleased that this legisla-
tion does just that. 
My life experiences have afforded me 
the opportunity as a former township 
trustee in northwest Indiana to work 
every day with the veterans commu-
nity. I was able to initiate a veterans 
services roundtable and bring together 
veteran organizations to discuss, co-
ordinate, and streamline much-needed 
resources to our veterans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H262 
January 20, 2022 
In many instances, it was not that 
the resources or the benefit was un-
available, but rather, the individual 
was unaware of the existing benefit, or 
unable to access, for whatever reason, 
the very resource they needed. 
Today, I am thinking of those count-
less discussions and individuals as I 
will vote to support the EVEST Act. It 
is an effective proposal to help ensure 
that 
veterans 
access 
the 
valuable 
healthcare services available to them 
during this transition process from ac-
tive to veteran status. 
Today, I want to make sure we meet 
our veterans’ mental health needs and 
increase veterans’ access to healthcare. 
I again thank Chairman TAKANO and 
my fellow members of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee for your commit-
ment to supporting veterans and bring-
ing this measure to the floor today. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
In response to the EVEST Act has 
been in the public domain, I think it is 
very important to note, as I mentioned 
earlier, the last Congress is not the 
same as this Congress. We have more 
than 70 Members who are new Members 
of Congress, half of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee is new, we have a dif-
ferent President, and we have a dif-
ferent secretary. 
Introducing a bill is not the same as 
conducting a hearing. You can’t get 
input from the stakeholders. You can’t 
engage in meaningful debate in the 
public domain. This reflects zero input 
from the VA, meaning we have no idea 
whether it is flexible, whether it is 
workable, whether it is disruptive to 
the VA system. We don’t know. 
And even the Biden administration 
agrees that more work is needed before 
this bill should become law. 
And the previous speaker, Mr. Speak-
er, spoke about the person that didn’t 
know what was available to them 
through the VA. If you were my age as 
a veteran it is true that you could not 
know because you got a quick class and 
the TAP program. And I have men-
tioned on this floor before that that is 
a tap on the back and see you later. 
But today’s TAP program is a course 
that you take, and you are bound to 
understand separation from your ac-
tive service and what VA benefits are 
available to you. 
And not only that, the Trump admin-
istration in 2018 put an administrative 
order out that you are then contacted 
after separation at 90, 180, and 360 days 
out to be notified of what benefits are 
available to you in the VA. We are 
doing that. 
This instead enrolls members with-
out their consent, and then they are 
enrolled. And the only option they 
have is to be notified later how maybe 
they can get out of being enrolled. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to add that, in response to the 
esteemed ranking member, VA for-
mally supports this legislation and has 
been discussing auto enrollment for 
years. 
VA has already been working to 
make transition into VA healthcare 
smoother with Solid Start and will 
soon have data showing that warm 
handoffs have a positive impact on vet-
eran outcomes without overwhelming 
the VA system. 
In response to the criticism that 
VSOs have not had input, I want to 
point out that VSOs, including Para-
lyzed Veterans of America and Dis-
abled American Veterans, have already 
formally endorsed EVEST. Why? Be-
cause the common sense of this legisla-
tion shines through. 
All VSOs have had a chance to weigh 
in, and many did. The Nurses Organiza-
tion of Veterans Affairs, the American 
Federation of Government Employees, 
the Veterans Health Policy Institute, 
and the American Psychological Asso-
ciation also support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA), my good friend and a former 
member of the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee who now serves on the Ag-
riculture Committee, Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, and House Judiciary 
Committee. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in strong support of the EVEST 
Act. 
All gave some, and many made the 
ultimate sacrifice. America has made a 
promise to our veterans that we will 
take care of them when they return 
home. 
I represent Orange County, Cali-
fornia, and many of my constituents 
have served their country proudly. One 
of my constituents, Billy Hall, from 
the city of Orange, enlisted at the age 
of 15, served from 1941 to 1945 in World 
War II, and again from 1948 to 1967 in 
the Korean and Vietnam wars. 
Every servicemember deserves our 
respect and gratitude, and most of all, 
all the benefits and care that we prom-
ised them when they would return 
home. 
This bill is very simple but very im-
portant. It automatically enrolls vet-
erans in the healthcare system. It pro-
vides veterans healthcare without the 
red tape. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on the EVEST Act and pass this simple 
and important commonsense legisla-
tion for our veterans. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
In my debate and the things that I 
brought up here today, I never said 
that VSOs didn’t have input. I did say 
the VA did not come to the committee, 
and we did not have the proper hear-
ings. If the VA is in support of this bill, 
I would request that the VA send the 
documentation saying how they are in 
support of this bill. Their input would 
be vitally important. 
Whether it is a Republican or Demo-
crat administration, the VA is vitally 
important to make sure they provide 
services to our constituents and to our 
veterans. 
No one on this floor cares more about 
veterans than the people who serve on 
this committee—I can guarantee you 
that—whether it is the chairman or 
myself. 
But we have to make sure what we 
are providing does what it is we are 
trying to do. It was mentioned earlier 
that they believe that this would help 
reduce suicide among transitioning 
servicemembers. I care deeply about 
this. This is something that both I and 
the chairman have worked on and will 
continue to work on. 
The majority of veterans who die of 
suicide have not had meaningful en-
gagement with the VA. They may have 
been enrolled in the VA, but they 
haven’t gotten the VA care that they 
need. 
This bill would add names of eligible 
separating servicemembers from the 
VA and put them on the rolls, but it 
doesn’t do the outreach that is nec-
essary to possibly prevent them from 
that ultimate decision to end their 
lives. 
Those are the type of things we are 
working on and will continue to work 
on. This is not the answer to that. 
There are a lot of other concerns that 
I have expressed and will continue to 
express. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me say that the amendments 
that we are considering to this bill 
today, which I consider friendly, will 
address many of the ranking member’s 
concerns about the reaching out. 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES), my good 
friend who serves on the Financial 
Services Committee and the Perma-
nent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO for moving this very 
important legislation. 
In this polarized and angry time, one 
of the lights of this institution is that 
we have always come together to bet-
ter serve our veterans, to better serve 
those men and women who took the ul-
timate risk and were prepared to make 
the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of all 
of us and the system that this room 
embodies. 
And this is a real problem. As I go 
around my district and I talk to young 
veterans, they face any number of 
transitional issues; with housing, with 
healthcare. And let’s face it, the 
change from being on active duty to 
being a veteran is a challenging one, 
one that all too often results in the 
kind of tragedy that we have acknowl-
edged here in this Chamber today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H263 
January 20, 2022 
And so I rise in strong support of the 
EVEST Act. It is consistent with some-
thing that I am very proud to have ac-
complished many years ago when we 
passed the SERVE Act, which made it 
easier for veterans to show that they 
had an income so that they could get 
the housing which they were entitled 
to. It was a small thing, but it just 
eased the passage for those young men 
and women who have so well served 
this country. 
This is important, and it is not a big 
deal, but it is going to affect tens of 
thousands of veterans. My Republican 
friends know that I respect and value 
their input and their objections to our 
ideas. It makes us better when you 
pose objections to our ideas. But I am 
a little puzzled by the objections that I 
am hearing today. 
I have heard sitting here that this is 
not paid for. Okay. It is $3 billion that 
I think is well spent on perhaps the 
most valuable population that we have. 
But the notion that it is not paid for, 
let’s remember it was just a couple 
years ago that my friends on the Re-
publican side passed $2 trillion in tax 
cuts, 83 percent of which benefited the 
top 1 percent of this country’s citizens. 
I have to believe that if we can do $2 
trillion in tax cuts that largely bene-
fits the richest Americans, that we can 
find $3 billion to ease the passage for 
our veterans. 
b 0945 
I have heard the ranking member say 
that the VA maybe can’t handle it. 
Let’s remember that the VA supports 
this idea and that we are just asking 
them to do a little bit more of what 
they already do. This is not some new 
and fanciful program. No, it is making 
a program that is well-established 
available to more. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I am 
particularly proud of my friend and 
neighbor— JOE
COURTNEY
will talk 
about this shortly—that my neighbor, 
JAHANA HAYES, is proposing an amend-
ment that will increase the notifica-
tion that goes to veterans about what 
is available to them. 
This bill needs to pass because, at the 
end of the day, we are answering the 
question: Do we want more veterans to 
have access to what we have promised 
them, or do we want fewer veterans to 
have access to what we have promised 
them? That is what is at stake here. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member and urge him to rethink his 
objections to this bill because this will 
be a proud moment when this bill 
passes. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs did not 
do our job on this bill. We did not con-
sider this bill in a legislative hearing. 
We did not seek input from stake-
holders or the VA. We did not make 
certain that automatically enrolling 
newly separated servicemembers into 
the VA healthcare system would not 
impede access for existing employees 
or cause funding crises. And those 
things are very, very real. 
Even the Biden OMB has admitted 
that there are going to be challenges 
with implementing this bill. If you 
look at the numbers—and I am going 
to add this into what should be men-
tioned—19.1 million veterans is what 
we have; 9 million veterans are en-
rolled; 7 million have used access to 
the VA. If we start and do it this way 
without letting veterans make deci-
sions on their own, it can overwhelm 
the VA. That is what has been men-
tioned by OMB. 
Veterans are already facing tough 
challenges. So is the VA health system 
that they can go to. But we don’t need 
to add any more to their plates with-
out at least hearing how it is going to 
affect the services that are already 
being provided to our veterans. 
That is why, just so you know, I am 
offering a motion to recommit this 
morning. My motion to recommit, if 
adopted, would send this bill back to 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs to 
consider an amendment to H.R. 4673 
that would delay implementation until 
30 days after the VA has certified that 
it can implement, without disruption, 
services to veterans or requiring addi-
tional funds. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t see how those 
who support this bill, despite its prob-
lems and the Biden administration’s 
recognition that it may cause chal-
lenges, can object to this amendment. 
The very least we can do for the mil-
lions of veterans who are already en-
rolled in VA care and counting on VA 
services is to ensure—before this bill 
goes into effect—that it won’t cause 
undue harm to them. I have already 
drafted an amendment that would ac-
complish that goal. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support my motion to re-
commit, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say, in re-
sponse to my friend, the esteemed 
ranking member, that his MTR, which 
would delay implementation in order 
to avoid harm to our veterans, dare I 
say that the harm is in the delay. 
I am reminded of a quote from the 
VFW’s Pat Murray that we had at yes-
terday’s roundtable on toxic exposure: 
Our pay-for for this bill and our pay- 
for, frankly, for all that we do for vet-
erans was the ticket that we sent serv-
icemembers overseas to serve. I repeat: 
Our pay-for was the ticket we sent 
servicemembers overseas to serve. 
And a little further discussion on the 
pay-for issue: The Congressional Budg-
et Office does not estimate that this 
bill will increase mandatory spending 
and does not require an offset. These 
are the rules we play by. 
Again, we are not creating new eligi-
bility here. The only cost of this bill is 
veterans seeking care that they are al-
ready eligible for. We are all better off 
when veterans are seeking the care 
that they need, and we should not be 
hiding that care for which they are eli-
gible. 
Automatic 
enrollment 
in 
VA 
healthcare for eligible veterans is a 
long-needed suicide prevention tool. 
We cannot put a price tag on pro-
tecting the health and safety of our 
veterans. Many of these veterans would 
go on to use VA healthcare even if they 
are not automatically enrolled, and the 
minority does not give a compelling 
reason why we should hinder or make 
that process more difficult for our vet-
erans. 
Again, I repeat, we should not be hid-
ing the care for which our veterans are 
already eligible. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my col-
leagues join me in passing H.R. 4673, as 
amended, and I anticipate we will see a 
big bipartisan vote today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
here in strong support of H.R. 1836, the En-
suring 
Veterans’ 
Smooth 
Transition 
Act 
(EVEST), which provides automatic enrollment 
in the VA for all transitioning service members, 
and veterans who don’t want to obtain its 
services have the easy choice of opting out. 
Specifically, this bill would: 
Automatically enroll new veterans into VA 
Health Care; 
Provide 
VA 
with 
information 
about 
transitioning service members; 
Require the VA to reach out to veterans 
about the scope of, and access to, benefits. 
Assuring future cohorts of veterans—includ-
ing those struggling with the Taliban triumph in 
Afghanistan—don’t go without health care dur-
ing their transition from military to civilian life 
is the worthy goal of this bill. 
After attempting suicide while serving on ac-
tive duty in Iraq, Kristofer Goldsmith was given 
a general discharge by the Army and little 
else. 
The overwhelmed 21-year-old returned to 
his hometown on Long Island, N.Y., totally un-
aware that he was eligible for care from the 
Veterans Health Administration (VA). 
‘‘I had just lost my income, my support net-
work, my identity, and almost my life. I was in 
a total mental health crisis,’’ Goldsmith said. 
During the critical months following his tran-
sition to civilian life, he went without des-
perately needed services. 
If his mother hadn’t forced him to go to the 
VA, Goldsmith, who credits the VA with help-
ing him rebuild his life, doesn’t know what 
would have happened to him. 
Of this, however, he is certain, ‘‘If I had 
heard from my local VA informing me of what 
benefits I had and that I’d been enrolled in the 
system, it would have changed my life dras-
tically.’’ 
This bill would help thousands of veterans 
who need services for the multitude of condi-
tions acquired or exacerbated by military serv-
ice but are confused about how to access 
them.

These ailments include everything from res-
piratory problems caused by burn-pit toxic ex-
posure to signature combat conditions such as 
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Trau-
matic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 
For all these problems, prompt attention 
means everything. 
For example, according to research con-
ducted by the VA, veterans who received care 
soon after the end of their service ‘‘had lower 
levels of PTSD upon follow-up a year after 
they initiated care. 
According to the study, for each year that a 
veteran waited to initiate treatment, there was 
about a 5 percent increase in the odds of their 
PTSD either not improving or worsening. 
In 
2018, 
the 
National 
Academies 
of 
Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found 
that post-9/11 veterans who had not sought 
VA mental health care didn’t know how to 
apply for benefits—or were unsure whether 
they were even eligible. 
Some didn’t know what services the VA of-
fered or felt that they didn’t deserve care even 
if they could get it. 
Some women veterans are similarly unsure 
whether VA services are even available to 
their gender. 
This legislation will not only be key to elimi-
nating these barriers but also to reducing the 
veteran suicide crisis. 
A disproportionate number of veterans die 
by suicide during the initial months and years 
following separation from military service. 
Veterans ages 18 to 34 have the highest 
rate of suicide. 
Automatic pre-enrollment could be lifesaving 
during a crisis when speed is of the essence. 
Smoother access to VA health care has 
never been more important than it is today. 
The tumultuous end of the war in Afghani-
stan is intensifying mental health symptoms 
within the veteran population. 
I am proud to support this legislation in 
order to better serve veterans and reduce vet-
eran suicide. 
This bill, in which we further the benefits 
and recognition that our servicemen and 
women deserve, also reminds us that we have 
an overriding duty to protect the health and 
dignity of those serving today. 
For this reason, I would like to discuss the 
crisis that our National Guardsmen and 
Guardswomen have been thrust into at the 
Texas Governor’s direction on our Southern 
Border. 
In 
March 
2021, 
the 
Texas 
Governor 
launched the ill-fated and ineffective Operation 
Lone Star which he claimed was necessary to 
stem a so-called invasion of migrants at 
Texas’ southern border. 
As of November 2021, more than 10,000 
Texas National Guardsmen have been de-
ployed to the southern border in pursuit of this 
folly. 
According to published media accounts, Na-
tional Guard members who have been acti-
vated for Operation Lone Star are experi-
encing habitual pay delays and poor working 
conditions during the border mission, including 
being exposed to COVID–19, and many are 
missing the equipment necessary for safety 
and mission success. 
In addition, the National Guard has faced 
austere conditions and limited resources, lead-
ing to unsanitary conditions such as the lack 
of portable restrooms. 
Rather than addressing these conditions, 
just last week the Texas Governor filed a frivo-
lous lawsuit in federal court challenging the 
authority of President Biden, the Commander- 
in-Chief of the Armed Forces to require that 
members of the National Guard be vaccinated 
against COVID–19. 
There is no merit to this nuisance law suit 
as demonstrated by the summary rejection of 
similar arguments raised by neighboring Okla-
homa Governor Stitt. 
The Texas Governor’s failure to comply with 
the policies intended to reduce the spread of 
COVID–19 among the Armed Forces will 
mean that there will be less military personnel 
available national disasters that have struck 
Texas in recent years, such as the winter 
freeze of last year. 
This will also mean that there are fewer per-
sonnel to respond to any attacks on the home-
land. 
Encouraged by the Texas Governor’s obsti-
nacy, about 40% of the members of the Texas 
Army National Guard are refusing to get vac-
cinated, which puts at risk their colleagues 
and the persons they are sworn to defend and 
protect. 
National Guardsmen and Guardswomen de-
ployed in this disastrous mission at the Texas 
Governor’s insistence face the deadly spread 
of COVID–19, unsanitary conditions, lack of 
pay, and a lack of a certain future. 
These uniformed men and women deserve 
better, and some of them, seeing no alter-
native to their present reality, have decided to 
end it all. 
Five National guard soldiers have shot and 
killed themselves in the past three months, 
and one more survived a suicide attempt. 
One of these men, private first class Joshua 
R. Cortez, was preparing to accept a ‘‘lifetime 
job’’ with one of the nation’s biggest health in-
surance companies in late October last year, 
but the Texas National Guard had other ideas. 
Operation Lone Star required involuntary ac-
tivations to meet the Texas Governor’s troop 
quotas, and Cortez was one of the soldiers 
tapped to go on state active duty orders—with 
no idea how long the mission would last. 
In November, the 21-year-old mechanic re-
quested a hardship release from the mission: 
‘‘I’ve been waiting for this job and I’m on my 
way to getting hired . . . I missed my first op-
portunity in September when I had to go on 
the flood mission in Louisiana. . . . I can not 
miss this opportunity because it is my last op-
portunity for this lifetime job.’’ 
Cortez’s 
company 
commander 
rec-
ommended approval. But his battalion com-
mander and brigade commander disapproved. 
Within 36 hours of his request being denied, 
Cortez drove to a parking lot in northwest San 
Antonio and shot himself in the head. 
Three other soldiers tied to Operation lone 
Star have died by suicide, including: 
Sgt. Jose L. De Hoyos was found dead in 
Laredo, Texas, on Oct. 26. He was a member 
of the 949th Brigade Support Battalion’s head-
quarters company. 
1st Sgt. John ‘‘Kenny’’ Crutcher died Nov. 
12, as time ran out on his temporary hardship 
waiver. He was the top NCO for B Company, 
3rd Battalion, 144th Infantry. 
1st Lt. Charles Williams, a platoon leader in 
Crutcher’s company, died at home overnight 
Dec. 17 while on pass. 
The string of suicides raises urgent ques-
tions about the mission’s conditions and pur-
pose, as well as the way it’s organized and 
manned through indefinite involuntary call-ups. 
This is an excellent and common-sense bill 
that will enhance the benefits of our service-
men and women. 
We must also act to ensure that our service-
men and women are protected from COVID– 
19, both for their own safety and the safety of 
our nation. 
Although we cannot bring back the lives lost 
due to the Texas Governor’s misguided ac-
tions, we can remember the names of those 
we have lost and work to ensure that we treat 
all members of our military equally and with 
dignity and respect.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 860, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. TAKANO) 
and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
BOST) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of these en bloc 
amendments. Seamlessly connecting 
veterans with the benefits and care 
they earned through their service is 
paramount to the transition process. 
The Delgado amendment No. 1 makes 
sure that VA can easily notify veterans 
regarding care and services through 
mass texting. As technology and com-
munication 
methods 
improve, 
so 
should how VA uses those capabilities 
to easily inform veterans of their bene-
fits. Texting eligible veterans to tell 
them they have been auto-enrolled in 
VA healthcare is an effective, simple 
way to increase awareness of the care 
available to them. 
The Delgado amendment No. 2 re-
quires GAO to submit a report to deter-
mine the best methods to notify vet-
erans regarding their automatic enroll-
ment in VA healthcare. This amend-
ment will strengthen the underlying 
bill and inform best practices for how 
VA can ensure veterans have the infor-
mation they need regarding their ac-
cess to care and services. 
Getting information to veterans in 
an effective manner is crucial to their 
transition into civilian life, and the 
Delgado amendment No. 2 will help im-
prove how VA communicates an eligi-
ble 
veteran’s 
enrollment 
in 
VA 
healthcare so they can easily access 
the care they need. 
The Hayes amendment requires that 
VA notify veterans who opt out of 
automatic enrollment that they may 
elect to enroll at a later date. We un-
derstand there will be some veterans 
who opt out for auto-enrollment for a 
variety of reasons, but it is our duty 
that they know that the VA will be 
waiting for them if their future needs 
change. 
Ensuring VA adopts and scales best 
practices related to auto-enrollment 
while also learning from any issues 
that arise during its rollout is impor-
tant to the long-term effectiveness of 
the aims of H.R. 4673. 
The Tlaib amendment requires the 
VA to submit a report a year after the 
first veteran is auto-enrolled in VA 
healthcare to preserve lessons learned 
from the rollout. This report will help 
improve auto-enrollment for both the 
VA administrators implementing the 
program and veteran users alike. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the en bloc amendments, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the four en bloc amend-
ments are offered by Congressman 
DELGADO, Congresswoman HAYES, and 
Congresswoman TLAIB. I thank them 
for their work. I remain opposed to the 
underlying bill, and I explained why in 
detail over the last debate. 
One of the reasons I was opposed to it 
is because the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs did not do our job before bring-
ing this bill to the floor. We did not 
hold hearings on the bill or seek input 
from stakeholders. And importantly, 
we did not get assurance from the VA 
that the bill could be implemented 
without negative impact to services. 
In fact, shortly before this bill hit 
the Rules Committee, the Biden ad-
ministration did release the statement 
that we talked about earlier. That 
statement, remember, says that there 
are challenges in implementing this 
bill. 
Now, I wish we could have done that 
work in the VA Committee before con-
sidering the bill on the floor. If there 
are challenges, we need to know about 
them, and we need to be able to address 
them to make sure that no veteran is 
harmed by this bill. 
Nevertheless, here we are. These en 
bloc amendments will help get some of 
the information we should have gotten 
before passing the bill. They will help 
us stay informed on how the bill is 
working and the impact it is having on 
veterans and on the VA healthcare sys-
tem after the fact. 
For example, one of Congressman 
DELGADO’s amendments would require 
GAO to study the best methods for VA 
to notify newly separated servicemem-
bers of their enrollment status. His 
second amendment would require VA 
to consider texting newly separated 
servicemembers to inform them of 
their enrollment status and their abil-
ity to disenroll. If a veteran chooses to 
disenroll, 
Congresswoman 
HAYES’ 
amendment would require VA to pro-
vide them with information on how to 
enroll at a later date if they change 
their mind down the line. 
Finally, 
Congresswoman 
TLAIB’s 
amendment would require VA to report 
to Congress on the implementation of 
this bill not later than 1 year after en-
actment. That would allow us to 
course-correct, as needed, if the bill is 
causing problems at least 1 year out. 
Now, I feel like a broken record, but 
this is information we should have had 
already. Nevertheless, it is better late 
than never. That is why I will be in 
support of that amendment alongside 
the amendments for DELGADO
and 
HAYES. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
do the same, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 71⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. COURTNEY), my good 
friend who serves on the House Com-
mittee on Armed Services as chairman 
of the Subcommittee on Seapower and

quarantining. Her amendment is a 
commonsense proposal to improve an 
already outstanding bill that will con-
nect more veterans to benefits they 
have earned by volunteering to wear 
the uniform of this country. 
Mr. Speaker, last year, at the outset 
of the VA’s highly successful COVID 
vaccination program, Congresswoman 
HAYES and I both toured the VA hos-
pital in West Haven, Connecticut, 
which is the flagship of our VA 
healthcare system. I had a chance to 
personally observe her authentic, well- 
informed advocacy for veteran patients 
and their family members, asking 
questions about ways Congress can im-
prove the system, particularly about 
communicating the full extent of their 
benefits. 
She described casework from the vet-
erans seeking care, about the burdens 
they faced when navigating a com-
plicated system where not only vet-
erans, but family members struggle to 
stay current with changing rules and 
programs. It is particularly trouble-
some to hear cases of veterans who lose 
eligibility for help because of late 
claims caused by poor communication, 
oftentimes at the time of discharge 
from military service. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why it is so im-
portant for the House to pass the 
EVEST Act which will provide auto-
matic enrollment in the VA system for 
all transitioning servicemembers. 
Mrs. 
HAYES’ 
friendly 
amendment 
wisely requires the VA to go the extra 
mile and inform veterans who opt out 
of automatic enrollment through mul-
tiple 
methods, 
including 
not 
only 
email but also paper mail, that they 
can reenroll as they transition out of 
the military. Her measure is a com-
monsense insurance that veterans are 
informed of the EVEST so that they 
know from day one all of the options 
and rights that they have to get help. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank 
Chair TAKANO
and Ranking Member 
BOST. 
And I will close by simply noting 
that my district in eastern Connecticut 
is home to the largest military instal-
lation in New England, with 9,000 sail-
ors and officers who work every day to 
protect our Nation. The transition 
from military to civilian life happens 
on a rolling, nonstop basis. Too often 
we work with veterans who experience 
gaps in benefits caused by a failure to 
enroll or late enrollment, which this 
excellent bill will fix. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY). 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support the Hayes 
amendment in the en bloc and the un-
derlying bill. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB), my good friend 
and author of this amendment. She 
serves on the Financial Services Com-
mittee, the Natural Resources Com-
mittee and the Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO and the committee 
staff for working with me on this im-
portant amendment and for their lead-
ership on this bill. I can’t thank him 
enough and look forward to him one 
day coming to my district for a visit to 
our VA hospital that we love and cher-
ish. 
Mr. Speaker, the transition of being 
on Active Duty to being a veteran is 
not easy. The EVEST Act helps with 
that transition and makes life easier 
for those who served our Nation. 
This act is also a great opportunity 
to review the automatic enrollment 
programs and learn what works and 
what doesn’t, because ensuring effec-
tive implementation is critical to its 
success. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a social worker at 
heart, and we have to ensure that our 
veterans’ lives are changing for the 
better with this bill. My amendment 
ensures the lessons learned during im-
plementation of the program are pre-
served for other agencies, as well as to 
learn, again, what to do and what not 
to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the com-
mittee for working with me on this and 
look forward to my colleagues’ support 
of this amendment. I also look forward 
to working with the committee on a 
number of other issues impacting our 
veterans, especially veteran suicide 
and access to mental health services. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN), my good friend and 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee where he is chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves-
tigations. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
by way of further introduction, I am 
the same AL GREEN who lives across 
the street from the DeBakey VA hos-
pital; the same AL GREEN who fought 
in this Congress to secure a Congres-
sional Gold Medal for Dr. Michael E. 
DeBakey; the same AL GREEN who has 
800 flags outside of his office presently 
to be distributed over at the DeBakey 
VA hospital; the same AL GREEN that 
goes there annually and speaks to vet-
erans, who talks to them about their 
needs on an annual basis; the same AL 
GREEN who has had veterans who tell 
me the difficulties associated with en-
rollment; the same AL GREEN who has 
veterans who say they are so pleased 
that somebody would come by to be of 
service to them. 
Mr. Speaker, this AL
GREEN
an-
nounces here and now that I will sup-
port the underlying bill. I support it 
because it is necessary. I support it be-
cause I believe the veterans that I have 
spoken to will support it. They need it, 
and they will enjoy knowing that we 
came to this floor to bring this to fru-
ition. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, if the VA hos-
pital is not properly funded and this 
creates some funding issues, I am pre-
pared to vote to fund the VA hospital 
sufficiently so that our veterans can be 
taken care of. Anyone who is willing to 
go to a distant place, who may not re-
turn the same way they left, who may 
have issues for the rest of their lives, 
and they do it because they want to 
protect this country, I am going to do 
all that I can to protect them. This is 
the least a grateful Nation can do. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close. I ask all my colleagues to sup-
port me in supporting these four 
amendments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I have

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-

following: ‘‘who is discharged or separated 
from the Armed Forces on or after the date 
that is 90 days before the date of the enact-
ment of this Act and’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 860, the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
TAKANO for his continued, strong, un-
wavering leadership on behalf of our 
veterans. 
I am proud to represent a district 
that is home to a strong and growing 
veteran community, and proud to rep-
resent Fort Bliss in Congress, where 
thousands of our servicemembers tran-
sition to civilian life. 
One of my top priorities in Congress 
has been to protect our veterans and 
their families in the same way they 
have served and defended our country. 
Today, I am honored to stand in sup-
port of this critical legislation for our 
Nation’s veterans and to present my 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4673, the Ensuring 
Veterans’ Smooth Transition Act, pro-
vides automatic enrollment in the VA 
for all transitioning servicemembers.

the use of healthcare benefits that vet-
erans have already earned. My amend-
ment seeks to ensure that servicemem-
bers who were discharged up to 90 days 
before the enactment of this legisla-
tion can also reap its benefits. 
Servicemembers transitioning to ci-
vilian life already face a multitude of 
hurdles, from adjusting to everyday 
life, 
dealing 
with 
unemployment 
issues, housing and security, and poor 
mental and physical health, among 
other things. 
Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve 
that we eliminate these and any other 
barriers. Thousands of veterans leave 
the service without knowing about the 
VA, whether they are eligible, and 
what benefits they are entitled to re-
ceive. 
Veterans who returned to civilian life 
during the pandemic faced even more 
challenges to access and overall en-
gagement with the VA due to closures 
and the VA’s limited operational ca-
pacity at the height of the pandemic. 
We cannot leave these veterans behind. 
Already, more than half of eligible 
veterans don’t use VA health benefits, 
many of which are due to confusion on 
eligibility and benefits and lack of ac-
cess to information. The pandemic only 
exacerbated this. Our withdrawal from 
Afghanistan this past year similarly 
impacted millions of veterans who now 
need that care more than ever. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment is not 
adding any new entitlements. It is sim-
ply extending them to those who are 
equally in need. With my amendment 
to this bill, we can ensure that newly 
transitioned veterans do not miss the 
opportunity to access VA benefits they 
deserve and are entitled to. 
As our chairman has said, when it 
comes to supporting our veterans, the 
true heroes of our country, there is al-
ways more work to be done. This bill is 
truly transformative and assures fu-
ture cohorts of veterans receive the ex-
peditious access to the healthcare they 
need. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
my amendment. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I claim time 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman is recognized. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Congresswoman 
ESCOBAR’s amendment would expand 
automatic enrollment to servicemem-
bers who left the military 90 days be-
fore this bill is enacted. There are al-
ready many existing mechanisms for 
separating servicemembers to connect 
with the VA if that is something they 
need and want. 
As I explained during the general de-
bate, I have a number of serious con-
cerns with the underlying bill. The 
Biden administration agrees that there 
are challenges. I think that is an un-
derstatement. Regardless, we should 
not be further complicating an already 
difficult implementation by expanding 
it even more. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Escobar amendment to 
H.R. 4673. 
Mr. Speaker, seamlessly connecting 
veterans with the benefits and care 
they have earned through their service 
is paramount to the transition process. 
The Escobar amendment extends the 
automatic 
enrollment 
in 
VA 
healthcare to eligible veterans dis-
charged within 90 days before enact-
ment of the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, many of the 175,000 vet-
erans who served in Operation Endur-
ing Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
and Operation New Dawn are unaware 
of their eligibility for 5 years of VA 
healthcare upon separation. Automati-
cally enrolling recently separated eli-
gible veterans into VA healthcare will 
support our aim to prevent veteran sui-
cides and improve their access to care 
during their transition to civilian life. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Escobar amendment. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 860, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. ESCOBAR). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 228, nays 
198, not voting 7, as follows:

HONORING DETECTIVE JAMES 
STANKO 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Allentown Police 
Detective and Community Liaison Offi-
cer James Stanko, a man who dedi-
cated his life’s work to bridging the di-
vide between police officers and the 
community they serve. 
Officer Stanko died on Monday, a 
huge loss for our community, but his 
legacy lives on through the countless 
lives he touched. 
Officer Stanko wasn’t known for sit-
ting idly at a desk. His passions lay out 
in the community where he was known 
for mentoring our kids, whether it was 
through coaching basketball, talking 
at schools, or offering life lessons at 
the children’s clinic. 
As someone who worked closely with 
him put it, ‘‘Our kids called him fam-
ily.’’ He was a calming, yet dependable 
force that everyone, especially our 
youth, could turn to for guidance and 
support. 
Officer Stanko never stopped trying 
to achieve his ultimate goal of con-
necting the police department to the 
people that it serves. 
Working as an Allentown police offi-
cer for 13 years, Stanko never wavered 
in his values of honesty, integrity, and, 
most notably, respect for others. I was 
inspired by his sincere love for public 
service, as well as his passion for our 
community that he was proud to call 
home. He will be deeply missed. 
HONORING DIVISION CHAMPS 
CLINTON-MASSIE FALCONS 
(Mr. CAREY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, as a Clin-
ton County native, I rise today in 
honor of the 2021 Division IV Ohio high 
school football State champion, the 
Clinton-Massie Falcons. 
On December 3, 2021, the Clinton- 
Massie Falcons defeated the Youngs-
town Ursuline Irish in a thrilling come-
back victory that one would expect to 
see in a movie. 
Trailing 28–7 late in the third quar-
ter, the Falcons kept their poise and 
refused to be denied. They shut down 
the Irish offense while scoring on three 
straight possessions. The Falcon’s final 
touchdown came on a fourth and goal 
from the 1-yard line with under 1 
minute to play. 
With the score 28–27, the team didn’t 
think twice when given the choice. 
They went for 2 points and the win to 
bring home the school’s third State 
championship in just under 10 years. 
To Coach Dan McSurley and every 
player on the Falcon roster, congratu-
lations. As a former captain of the East 
Clinton Astro football team, I under-
stand the obstacles that you have had 
to overcome to earn this title. You 
have made our county proud and prov-
en that hard work and determination 
truly pay off. 
f 
INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
CA´ RDENAS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
thanks to President Biden’s Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act that I 
and many of us voted for, we are now 
putting those resources on the ground 
across America. 
The first billions of dollars to go to 
California and every State in the Union 
are now being put in place to fix 
bridges. Next, we are going to fix our 
roads and build our infrastructure to 
electrify our system throughout the 
country. 
These are the kinds of things that 
our voters sent us to Washington to do, 
to bring those resources back to every 
single community, every single one of 
our communities, and that is what we 
are doing here in Congress with a 
President who actually believes in the 
fundamentals of infrastructure and 
making sure that we put our American 
workers back to work to build our Na-
tion as it should be and what we are so 
proud of. 
We are the number one infrastruc-
ture place in the world, and we will 
continue to be so with these invest-
ments. 
f 
ONE YEAR OF CRISES 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today marks the 1-year 
anniversary of President Biden’s inau-
guration and 1 year under one-party 
rule. 
And I ask: Is America better off? The 
answer is no. 
Since President Biden took office, we 
have seen crisis after crisis. 
We are facing an economic crisis. 
President Biden and the Democrats had 
the tools to bring our economy back to 
the prepandemic records of 2019. But 
instead, we have massive supply short-
ages, labor shortages, and an inflation 
rate that has reached a 40-year high. 
Our country faces an energy crisis. 
We went from being energy inde-
pendent to begging OPEC+ to produce 
more oil to offset the rising costs. This 
is because of anti-American energy 
policies enacted over the past year. 
Mr. Speaker, the list goes on: an edu-
cation crisis as our youth continue to 
face uncertainty in the classroom; a 
national security crisis as our presence 
on the world stage has been weakened 
and our southern border remains vul-
nerable; and a crime crisis following 
dangerous defund the police rhetoric. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not the leader-
ship America needs right now. In fact, 
it is far from it. 
f 
b 1145 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND JOBS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. 
UNDERWOOD. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today marks one year of Democrats in 
Congress working alongside the Biden- 
Harris administration on behalf of 
American families. 
I am proud of what we have accom-
plished so far, including the once-in-a- 
generation investment in our roads and 
bridges made by the bipartisan infra-
structure law. With nearly 2,500 bridges 
in poor condition, Illinois ranks third 
among States with crumbling bridge 
infrastructure. Thanks to the bipar-
tisan infrastructure law, Illinois will 
receive $1.4 billion to repair and re-
build these bridges, like the Black-
berry Creek and Mendota railroad 
bridges in my district. 
These upgrades will save Illinoisans 
money on costly car repairs and time 
on their daily commutes. This long- 
overdue investment will also connect 
our communities and support our sup-
ply chain, while creating good-paying 
jobs and spurring economic develop-
ment. 
With the partnership of the Biden- 
Harris administration, we have spent 
the last 365 days delivering for the 
American people. Our work is far from 
finished.

COMMEMORATION OF DR. MARCY 
ZWELLING 
(Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today out of great respect and mourn 
the loss of Dr. Marcy Zwelling from 
California. 
Dr. Zwelling, since 2012, has headed 
up the National Physicians Council for 
Healthcare Policy, which is a group of 
some 570 independent physicians across 
the country. Dr. Zwelling not only 
challenged me but challenged all 570 
members of the Physicians Council to 
please advocate on behalf of not only 
patients but also physicians. She dedi-
cated her service and life not only to 
patients, attempting to give them the 
very best of medical help, but also for 
physicians. 
Physicians 
who 
many 
times are faced with innumerable chal-
lenges, not just to provide service but 
also in their own lives. 
So it is today I offer to the House of 
Representatives the great life of Dr. 
Marcy Zwelling who passed away this 
last weekend. May she rest in peace. 
May God bless her life and that which 
she gave each of us. 
Whether she was helping organize one of 
the over nine conferences of the National Phy-
sicians Council for Healthcare Policy nation-
wide, developing new screening tools for pa-
tients with cancer, or supporting her fellow 
physicians, Dr. Zwelling served as an inspira-
tion and servant leader for myself and so 
many others in the medical community. I will 
miss her leadership and inspiration. 
f 
THE NATION IS CRYING OUT FOR 
DEMOCRACY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in the name of Dr. Martin 
Luther King and John Robert Lewis, 
our late colleague. 
I rise today to say that we are not 
finished. The work of this Nation is not 
finished, even in the aftermath of a sin-
ister vote on the floor of the United 
States Senate that could not see clear-
ly to determine that the Constitution 
and the right to vote rose above the 
silly and insignificant rule of the Sen-
ate called the filibuster. 
In the midst of that debate, we heard 
eloquent 
and 
beautiful 
statements 
about the many times the filibuster 
had been eliminated or relieved. We 
heard a brilliant analysis of the Con-
stitution and the Founding Fathers’ 
desire for the filibuster not to be in the 
Constitution, yet due process and the 
15th Amendment are. 
Mr. Speaker, we saw justice crushed 
and democracy gored. In Texas, of 
course, more criminal laws are now re-
lated to voting. Poll watchers can at-
tack voters in terms of what they are 
doing. We are now in a constitutional 
hearing in Judiciary. It is my commit-
ment to go forward on the John Robert 
Lewis and all the bills attached to it 
because the Nation is crying out for 
justice. The country is crying out for 
democracy. We will not let it down. 
The Senate must continue its debate, 
and we must get these billed passed. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S BORDER 
CRISIS 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remind the American people 
that today marks President Biden’s 
one year in office and 365 days of his 
disastrous failure at our southern bor-
der. 
Forty percent of Americans graded 
Joe Biden’s immigration policy with a 
big fat F for his failures. His open bor-
der policy has proven month after 
month to be not only unsuccessful but 
downright dangerous for the American 
people. 
More deadly fentanyl products have 
been smuggled into our neighborhoods 
this year than ever before. Nearly 
11,000 pounds were apprehended in the 
last year alone. 
Biden’s wide open southern border is 
poisoning our communities and causing 
unthinkable harm. His bad policy is 
taking lives. It is no surprise that our 
Nation’s number of overdoses reached 
an all-time high in 2021. My heart 
breaks for the parents who have lost 
their children while our President 
plays politics. 
Mr. Speaker, I have said it before, 
and I will say it again. Border security 
is national security. It is time to stop 
deliberately destroying the safety of 
innocent Americans for the sake of pol-
itics. 
f 
POSTAL SERVICE DISRUPTIONS 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, almost a 
year ago, I spoke here about the delays 
in our postal system, and a year later 
the calls to our office have not stopped. 
In fact, they have gotten more frequent 
and more frantic. 
Since the start of this year, 50 per-
cent of all the phone calls our office 
has received are about disruptions in 
the Postal Service. These are from sen-
iors whose essential medications and 
Social Security checks were over 2 
weeks delayed; folks with missing cred-
it card statements, Medicare cards, 
past due still undelivered bills accruing 
interest that they can’t pay because 
their paycheck hasn’t come in; small 
business owners reliant on the mail 
who are completely unable to operate. 
Now, to be sure, the pandemic con-
tributes to some of this. It has in-
creased demand on the mail system, 
even as postal workers are staying 
home, 
quarantining, 
looking 
after 
loved ones. While leaders in the private 
sector have adapted to this moment, 
Postmaster DeJoy has responded to 
this by eliminating overtime, closing 
mail processing facilities, and remov-
ing mail sorting machines. He has 
made things worse. 
Now, in the private sector we would 
fix that. A corporate board wouldn’t 
tolerate it. They would hold this man 
to account. That hasn’t happened be-
cause we still don’t have a fully staffed 
Postal Board of Governors thanks to 
the Senate’s failure to confirm Presi-
dent Biden’s nominations. This is no 
way to run a business. It is no way to 
treat the American people. 
The Postal Service needs leaders as 
committed to public service as our let-
ter carriers and mail handlers. Frank-
ly, so does the U.S. Senate. It is time 
for them to act, to confirm these nomi-
nees and ensure the post office has a 
fully staffed and fully functioning 
board.

RECOGNIZING LAUREN GOLLOFON 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize and commend Lauren 
Gollofon 
from 
Bozeman, 
Montana. 
Lauren is a 17-year-old senior at Lib-
erty Online Academy and a former stu-
dent at Bozeman High School. When 
Lauren became aware that the Pledge 
of Allegiance was not being said daily 
in public schools in Bozeman, she 
sprang into action. Lauren notified 
school administrators that their fail-
ure to hold the Pledge of Allegiance 
every day violated Montana House Bill 
543, and asked that they hold the 
Pledge of Allegiance daily in accord-
ance with the State law. 
Within a week of her advocacy, local 
schools began to recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance daily. When asked why this 
was so important, Lauren said patriot-
ism is on the decline in the United 
States. When students say the Pledge 
of Allegiance, they are acknowledging 
the freedom and the values and also ev-
eryone who has died and fought for our 
country. 
This 
display 
of 
patriotism 
dem-
onstrates why a report just this year 
found that Montana is one of the most 
patriotic States in the Nation, a rank-
ing which we are extremely proud of. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all Mon-
tanans, I want to sincerely thank 
Lauren Gollofon for her leadership, 
community activism, and her dedica-
tion to the core principles that make 
this country great.

January 20, 2022 
Westminster, 
Colorado, 
who 
passed 
away on December 2, 2021. 
Bob was born December 24, 1937, in 
Greeley, Colorado, as one of eight chil-
dren and the oldest son. His family 
moved to Westminster in 1943 where 
Bob graduated from Westminster High 
School. 
He earned a bachelor’s degree and a 
master’s degree from Colorado State 
University, both in horticulture. Ac-
cording to a January 2020 profile in Or-
chard Living, he majored in horti-
culture because he did not want to 
wear a tie for a living. 
Bob married his wife, Shirley, on 
September 8, 1957. He had a long career 
in local and State politics, serving as 
Adams County Commissioner for 4 
years, beginning in 1979—where he ac-
tually helped me on one of my very 
first cases that I had as a lawyer—as 
the local board member for the Re-
gional Transportation District for 4 
years in 1999, and a State representa-
tive for District 29 from January 2003 
to 2005. He served terms on the West-
minster City Council, including a stint 
as mayor pro tem. He was a longtime 
proponent of local rail and helped 
found the advocacy group Rocky Moun-
tain Rail. 
Mr. Speaker, Bob was a devoted hus-
band and a loving father and grand-
father. He and Shirley raised two chil-
dren and enjoyed spending time with 
their grandchildren. I am deeply grate-
ful for his lifetime of service to our 
community. 
f 
UNITED STATES AID TO TALIBAN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, under 
recent 
comments 
President 
Biden 
made about his first year, he talked 
about under-promising and over-deliv-
ering. 
Given what the year looks like, 
please, Mr. President, under-deliver. 
Mr. Speaker, our country has seen 
unprecedented crisis and record infla-
tion, supply chain disruptions, price 
surges, gas and energy costs going 
through the roof, food supply short-
ages, empty shelves everywhere, higher 
prices. 
Unfortunately, the failures of Biden’s 
first year in office isn’t limited to just 
the United States alone. No, he hastily 
evacuated our troops from Afghani-
stan, leaving behind as many as 14,000 
U.S. citizens and legal residents and 
friends, as well as billions of dollars of 
countless weapons of ours that have 
fallen into the hands of the Taliban. So 
over 20 years of a record of Taliban and 
they get all these weapons to use 
against us or our friends in the neigh-
borhood. 
If this is not bad enough, the admin-
istration is now proposing to send over 
$300 million in foreign aid, basically, to 
the Taliban regime to do all the great 
things they have been doing. People in 
Afghanistan do need help, but we know 
the funds or food we send over there 
will go straight into the wrong hands. 
We need to have a better chain of 
supply to help them than what the 
Biden administration is proposing. The 
nonprofit rescue group known as Save 
Our Allies has been working tirelessly 
to rescue those left behind by Presi-
dent Biden’s disaster over there. They 
warn that the funds and supplies will 
not go into the hands of the average 
Afghan but, instead, straight into the 
hands of the Taliban. We need to 
rethink this. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KAHELE). Members are reminded to di-
rect their remarks to the Chair.

NEW MEXICO SUPPORTS 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. STANSBURY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, the 
history of New Mexico and our rural 
communities predate the founding of 
our great Nation. Our communities 
carry rich traditions and ways of life, 
from our tribal communities, to our 
land grants, to our farmers and ranch-
ers and small towns that dot the 
plains, mountains, and river valleys of 
our beautiful State. 
They are diverse, resilient, vibrant, 
and full of grit and determination. For 
far too long, our rural communities 
have been left behind in critical infra-
structure, which is why I am deeply 
proud that our bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill is already delivering for New 
Mexico, investing millions in rural 
roads, bridges, and airports, broadband, 
our electric grid, and life-giving water, 
creating thousands of jobs, and sup-
porting rural economic development 
across our State, because our rural 
communities are the backbone of New 
Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud that we are 
working together to invest in infra-
structure, to invest in jobs, and the 
well-being of our future and our com-
munities. 
f 
b 1200 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
(Mr. GOOD of Virginia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
today marks 1 year of total Democrat 
control of the Federal Government—1 
year of this Biden administration. In 
addition to all the other disastrous 
policies and the crises created by this 
President, it marks another year with 
1 million babies being slaughtered in 
the womb in our country. 
Tomorrow we will, once again, march 
for life here in Washington, DC, and I 
will be privileged to join that march. 
May it be the last time that we do that 
before the Supreme Court rightly over-
turns the brutal, vicious, inhumane, 
dishonest, and inaccurate interpreta-
tion of the highest law of the land—the 
Constitution—giving the right to ter-
minate a pregnancy in the womb. 
Sixty-five million babies have been 
lost since that happened nearly 50 
years ago. These are inventors, these 
are scientists, these are ministers, and 
these are healthcare providers who are 
not serving and helping our country 
here today. 
Equality begins in the womb, and 
freedom begins in the womb, and the 
science tells us that life begins in the 
womb. May the Supreme Court over-
turn Roe, and may we begin to protect 
all innocent, precious life in the womb. 
f 
SCHOOL DIRECTOR RECOGNITION 
MONTH 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, January 
is School Board Director Recognition 
Month, and I want to take a moment, 
as a former school board member and 
school board president, to recognize 
the contributions of these unpaid but 
essential community servants. 
In the best of times, being a school 
board member is challenging, requiring 
community members to step up and ad-
dress issues ranging from child devel-
opment to HR, and from transportation 
and construction to nutrition and nat-
ural disasters. There is never enough 
money to do everything we would like 
to for our children, and the number of 
regulations, mandates, and laws that 
must be met seems to be never-ending. 
It often seems like every choice is be-
tween two bad alternatives. 
As school directors are facing these 
outsized challenges compounded by a 
pandemic and political polarization, 
and the mental health challenges both 
have brought, I want to acknowledge 
their Herculean efforts to keep our 
children, our teachers, and our staff 
safe and give them every opportunity 
to succeed. 
I want them to know how much their 
efforts on behalf of our children, our 
schools, and our communities are ap-
preciated.

LIFE: GOD’S FIRST GIFT 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, having done this many times 
over the course of the past 14 years, to 
speak on behalf of life itself. It is the 
first and foremost gift that is given to 
us, and I think of the over 60 million 
children who have been taken out of 
that opportunity. 
It is my hope that we will never have 
to march again for the repeal of Roe v. 
Wade after the Supreme Court decides 
but, rather, that we stand and continue 
to march for life and the freedom of op-
portunities for individuals to not only

Life is a gift of God. It can only be

that same gift, and I just pray that the 
Supreme Court and, ultimately, Con-
gress and the legislatures of our land 
will stand for life.

FUNDING 
FOR 
THE 
PORT 
OF 
INDIANA-BURNS 
HARBOR 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my support for Con-
gress to complete the consideration of 
the fiscal year 2022 appropriations 
measures prior to the current deadline 
of February 18. I remain grateful that a 
transparent process was established for 
all Members to include eligible projects 
in these measures. 
Notably, for the first District of Indi-
ana, there are projects included that 
will allow for dredging and improve-
ments at the Port of Indiana-Burns 
Harbor. This incredible facility is es-
sential to the functions of the north-
west Indiana steel and manufacturing 
industries and supports thousands of 
steelworker jobs and longshoreman 
jobs along the way. 
Appropriations measures are not just 
funding numbers and direction for Fed-
eral programs and projects. They are a 
testament to the government’s invest-
ment that create jobs and grow our 
economy. 
I appreciate the ongoing communica-
tions of our appropriations leaders, and 
I look forward to doing all I can to en-
sure that these important measures are 
signed into law as soon as possible.

FORTY-NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF 
ROE V. WADE 
(Mrs. MCCLAIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, this 
week marks 49 years since the land-
mark Supreme Court decision of Roe v. 
Wade, 49 years since the choice won 
over life in the eyes of the American 
people. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle applaud Roe v. Wade and have 
no problem with the more than 62 mil-
lion innocent babies who have been 
aborted since 1973. 
I, however, find these numbers to be 
sickening. 
These children are just as worthy of 
life as a fully grown adult is. They are 
created in the image of God just as you 
and I are, and their lives should not be 
carelessly and despicably destroyed. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle preach and parade human 
rights. 
But where is the outrage for equal 
human rights for the unborn? 
It is frighteningly nonexistent, and 
their lack of consistency makes it very 
clear what their priorities are. 
How can you claim to care for one 
life when you don’t care for all lives, 
no matter how small? 
f 
HEALTHCARE WORKERS 
(Mr. FOSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank the men and women 
who have been on the front lines of this 
pandemic from the very beginning: our 
healthcare workers. On MLK Day, I 
had a chance to deliver care packages 
to hospitals and clinics in my district 
in Joliet, Aurora, and Naperville as a 
small token of appreciation for the 
tireless work of our healthcare work-
ers. 
As our Nation confronts this, hope-
fully final, winter surge of COVID, we 
should all keep in mind the people who 
are still going to work every day to 
care for people who are sick. Their 
dedication to their jobs is truly inspir-
ing, and they are literally saving lives 
every day. After almost 2 years of bat-
tling COVID, our healthcare workers 
are mentally and physically exhausted, 
but yet they still show up every day to 
provide care for others. 
We can all learn so much from them. 
I am honored to represent so many of 
them in my district in places like Ed-
ward Hospital in Naperville, Silver 
Cross Hospital in New Lenox, Rush 
Copley Medical Center in Aurora, and 
Aunt Martha’s Health Center in Joliet; 
just to name a few. 
So I want every healthcare worker in 
America—doctors, nurses, and support 
staff—to know that they are not alone. 
I thank them for being there.

THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S 1- 
YEAR REVIEW 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, in busi-
ness, a 1-year review is customary. So 
let’s review the Biden administration’s 
first year by the numbers. As we tend 
to say in business, the numbers don’t 
lie. 
Regarding the economy, there are 6 
million Americans unemployed while 
10 million jobs remain unfilled. The 
vast majority of small businesses are 
hiring, yet 95 percent report few appli-
cations. Inflation, Mr. Speaker, is at a 
40-year high of 7 percent. Gas is up 50 
percent, and it costs about $100 to fill 
up the gas tank on a pickup truck. 
Regarding national security, it is 
really no better. Two million illegals 
have crossed our border. Twice as much 
fentanyl is coming in; we have over 
100,000—sadly—fatalities 
throughout 
the United States. And we have 125,000 
troops preparing to invade Ukraine. 
We have 2-mile long lines for COVID 
testing in my district. 
Mr. Speaker, we are not going to hold 
our breath for corrective action to be 
taken by the Biden administration; 
they have stated how they plan to dou-
ble down. It will be up to the American 
people to solve this problem come No-
vember. 
f 
ROE V. WADE 
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, as I 
stand at this podium, I will speak for 
about 60 seconds, and within those 60 
seconds, an unborn baby will lose its 
life. In fact, in America, an unborn 
baby will have its life ripped away 
every 50 seconds through the gruesome 
procedure of abortion. This is about 
630,000 unborn lives lost per year—a 
number that equals about 80 percent of 
my congressional district. 
This is tragic. God has a plan for 
these children. They are our brothers, 
sisters, friends, and loved ones. They 
are future leaders, nurses, doctors, 
farmers, and small business owners. 
But, 
most 
importantly, 
they 
are 
human beings with a purpose from our 
Creator. There is nothing more hideous 
than taking the life of the most vulner-
able in our society. 
Forty-nine years ago, the decision 
made by the Supreme Court in Roe v. 
Wade has resulted in the death of over 
621⁄2 million unborn babies. Despite the 
three-quarters of Americans who want 
significant restrictions on abortions, 
my colleagues across the aisle are still 
prioritizing their abortion-on-demand 
agenda. 
This is senseless. Together, as a na-
tion, we must make this the last year 
we speak on this horrible anniversary. 
We cannot wait another 50 seconds, an-
other 50 months, or another 50 years. 
Everyone is entitled to the right to 
life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H274 
January 20, 2022 
Manny served on many boards, com-
missions, and organizations in Orange 
County, and he also served 9 years on 
the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of 
Orange County’s Board of Directors. 
Among his many accomplishments, 
he was honored as Volunteer of the 
Year by the University of Georgetown, 
as well as receiving the Lifetime 
Achievement Award from the Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce of the State of 
California. 
Manny’s story started in New Mexico 
when he was 17. Then his high school 
principal chose two of the best stu-
dents in his high school to be part of 
the Boys State program. Manny was 
one of those students. 
He moved to Washington, D.C. later 
on and attended Georgetown Univer-
sity while he worked for then-Senator 
Dennis Chavez. Years later he attended 
law school where he met his wife, 
Betty, at the same time while working 
at the Department of Labor. They had 
four children. And Manny had a very 
long career in the private sector work-
ing for State Farm Insurance. 
As we celebrate his life, we know his 
memory will serve as a great example 
to this next generation. 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOS-
TER). 
BRANDON ROAD PROJECT 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to share some great news about 
our efforts to protect Lake Michigan 
and the rivers and lakes throughout Il-
linois and the entire Great Lakes re-
gion from invasive Asian carp. 
Yesterday, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers announced that thanks to 
the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, $225 million of new 
funding is headed to Illinois for the 
Brandon Road Project. The Brandon 
Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines 
River in Joliet, Illinois, is the last best 
line of defense against the spread of 
this invasive species into waterways 
not just in Illinois but to lakes and 
tributaries 
throughout 
the 
entire 
Great Lakes basin. 
The economic and environmental 
consequences of allowing this infesta-
tion to spread would be massive, and 
that is why securing Federal funding 
for the Brandon Road Project has been 
one of my most important priorities 
for several years. 
Last year, I joined my colleagues on 
the Great Lakes Task Force to urge 
the 
Army 
Corps 
of 
Engineers 
to 
prioritize the Brandon Road Project. 
And 3 years ago, I hosted members of 
the then-Republican-controlled Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee for a tour of the Brandon Road 
site so that they could have a first-per-
son look at the importance of this 
project. 
This injection of much-needed fund-
ing means that we can move forward 
on getting this project done and pro-
tecting our waterways, and not just 
our Great Lakes, but the beautiful 
lakes and rivers that define the entire 
Great Lakes region for generations to 
come. 
I just wish that more of my Repub-
lican colleagues had actually voted for 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill to 
provide the funding for this great 
project. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, for dec-
ades, Americans have been asking their 
elected leaders to fix crumbling roads 
and bridges and modernize our Nation’s 
transportation infrastructure. For dec-
ades, politicians of both parties prom-
ised to deliver on an infrastructure 
package. President Trump even prom-
ised that he would be the one person to 
get it done. But he didn’t, not even 
when 
Republicans 
controlled 
the 
House, Senate, and Presidency. 
b 1215 
It was President Biden and this 
Democratic Congress that finally got it 
done even though more than 90 percent 
of my Republican colleagues voted 
against it. Thanks to this new law, 
people in my State will benefit from 
robust Federal investment in the infra-
structure that they rely on every day: 
$11.2 billion for highway and bridge re-
pairs; $1.7 billion to make sure that ev-
eryone has access to clean drinking 
water; $4 billion to enhance public 
transportation; $616 million for infra-
structure enhancements at Illinois air-
ports; 
and 
over 
$100 
million 
for 
broadband internet expansion. 
Just last week, the Department of 
Transportation announced that $1.4 bil-
lion was already on its way to Illinois 
to repair bridges all across the State. 
This is the largest investment in our 
State’s bridges since the construction 
of the Interstate Highway System, and 
it is just the beginning of the infra-
structure investments that will benefit 
the people of Illinois every day. 
I have to say, I look forward to meet-
ing my Republican colleagues at the 
ribbon cutting ceremonies for all of 
these projects that they voted against. 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here today to talk 
about the foundation of our democracy: 
the right to vote and why we must pro-
tect it. 
I want to begin just by telling a little 
bit about me. My story is somewhat 
unique. I didn’t take the traditional 
path to Congress. Before I got here, I 
played in the NFL for 5 years as a line-
backer for the Tennessee Titans. After 
hurting my neck, I decided to pursue 
my other dream, which was to become 
a voting rights attorney, a civil rights 
attorney. While I was in law school, I 
decided to focus on voting rights be-
cause of what I saw happening in my 
home State of Texas where it was be-
coming harder to vote as the State was 
becoming more and more diverse. 
After I came back to Texas, I worked 
doing voter protection in 2014, setting 
up poll watcher programs across the 
State of Texas, trying to help voters 
deal with the new voter ID law that 
had just been put in place and that I 
knew was going to deeply impact so 
many Texans. Then I became a voting 
rights litigator suing States like Ohio 
and Wisconsin for the laws that they 
passed making it harder for the people 
in their States to vote. 
Then I was lucky enough to rejoin 
the Obama administration and finish 
out that administration. 
I decided to come home and run for 
Congress in my hometown and my 
home district where I was born and 
raised. In 2018, I ran against an oppo-
nent who had been unopposed in 2016. I 
won, and I am now proud to be rep-
resenting the 32nd Congressional Dis-
trict in Congress. 
In that campaign in 2018, I had the 
distinct honor of having Congressman 
John Lewis come join me in Dallas. Mr. 
Lewis is my hero, and to have him with 
me talking to voters and campaigning 
with me was, to say the least, surreal. 
We went on to become colleagues, and 
I considered him to be a friend and a 
mentor. I know that without John 
Lewis, I would not be here today. There 
would be no Congressional Black Cau-
cus. 
So many of us would not be here 
today were it not for him, the other 
civil rights leaders, and the foot sol-
diers who fought for the right to vote. 
That is why we named this critical 
piece of legislation after him, the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
Now, this piece of legislation is not 
coming out of thin air. It is not a Fed-
eral takeover. Many of the reforms are 
intended to address long-held problems 
with access to the ballot box for many 
Americans. It is also meant to address 
the gutting of the Voting Rights Act 
by the Supreme Court in 2013, and the 
440 voting restriction bills across 49 
States that have been introduced in re-
cent years. 
Many of those bills to restrict the 
right to vote have become law in 
States like my own, in Texas, in Geor-
gia, and so many other States. While 
other pieces address the direct and 
more recent threat to our democracy, 
including the counting of votes and the 
safety and security of election offi-
cials, this legislation is necessary for 
us to save our democracy. 
Yes, we have had setbacks in this 
fight. Yesterday was another one. Not 
enough of our Republican colleagues in 
the Senate were brave enough to stand 
up to President Trump’s lies and to 
vote for the same Voting Rights Act 
that the Senate had unanimously reau-
thorized in 2006 that my constituent, a 
Republican, President George W. Bush, 
signed in 2006. We were just shy of hav-
ing enough Democrats in the Senate 
with enough courage to change the 
rules so that we could protect our de-
mocracy. 
But I am here to say today, to all of 
my constituents and to anyone across 
the country who is worried about our 
democracy, that we can’t lose hope. We 
have had setbacks before, just as Mr. 
Lewis did, and we have come back from

January 20, 2022 
them. The American people have sent 
us a clear message. 
In 2020, 155 million Americans voted 
in a pandemic. They risked their lives 
to vote. That is how important it was 
to them. Campaign finance reform; 
ending partisan gerrymandering; and 
expanding access to the ballot by cre-
ating national standards around voter 
registration, early voting, and vote by 
mail are all necessary for us in our de-
mocracy, and they are commonsense 
ideas that are contained in the Free-
dom to Vote Act. They will fortify and 
protect this sacred right. 
But let’s talk about what is hap-
pening in the country because I hear 
all the time from folks that voting is 
not difficult; that there has not been a 
rash of voter suppression laws passed 
across the country; that this is a 
Democratic story that is being told. 
According to the Brennan Center for 
Justice, between January 1 and Sep-
tember 27 at least 19 States enacted 33 
laws to make it harder for Americans 
to vote. 
Restrictive laws in four States: Geor-
gia, Iowa, Kansas, and Texas, imposed 
new or more stringent criminal pen-
alties on election officials or other in-
dividuals for helping their fellow citi-
zens vote. These new criminal laws 
would deter election officials and oth-
ers who assist voters from engaging in 
ordinary, lawful, and often essential 
tasks. People in Georgia can now be 
charged with a crime for handing out 
water and snacks to voters waiting in 
line to vote; lines that were created in-
tentionally by restricting other ways 
to vote. 
Montana 
eliminated 
election 
day 
voter registration, making it harder 
for new voters or folks who have moved 
to vote in that State. 
Arizona temporarily restricted the 
powers of their secretary of State to 
represent them in lawsuits. And the 
reason? Because that position is held 
currently by a Democrat. 
Other States have shortened the win-
dow to apply or the deadline to deliver 
a mail-in ballot or have eliminated bal-
lot drop boxes and reduced polling 
places, and the list goes on and on and 
on. 
Mr. Speaker, 155 million Americans 
voted in 2020, the highest turnout since 
the 1900 election. The Trump adminis-
tration itself called it the most secure 
in American history. Yet, the lies 
about the election and the attacks on 
the right to vote have just continued 
and continued, and that is why I am 
standing here today. 
Because of this new lie, these new 
laws have been passed, and we are see-
ing voter suppression taking place in 
real time in my home State in Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to just talk 
about my home State for a little bit 
because I hear from a lot of Texans 
who wonder why voting rights experts 
like myself say that it is one of the 
most difficult States in the country to 
vote. 
I want to walk you through just how 
difficult it is to cast your ballot in my 
home State. First, the State of Texas 
makes it incredibly difficult to register 
to vote. In order for me to register my 
neighbors in Dallas County, I need to 
go to the Dallas County elections de-
partment, take a short course, and be-
come deputized as a volunteer deputy 
registrar. That is just to register my 
neighbors. After that, I am able to reg-
ister voters only in Dallas County, and 
I am only able to do that for 2 years be-
cause it is going to expire, and then I 
have to go back and get it reauthor-
ized. 
After I registered that voter which I 
have done hundreds of times, I have 5 
days to deliver the completed form 
that I filled out with them, or I face 
criminal penalties; 5 days. So if I lose 
it, something happens, I will be held 
criminally liable. If I would like to reg-
ister voters in both of the counties in 
my congressional district, Collin Coun-
ty and Dallas County, I would have to 
go to Collin County and get deputized 
separately there. If I meet a voter who 
lives in the city of Dallas but doesn’t 
know what county they live in, because 
four counties touch the city of Dallas, 
I would not be able to register them 
unless I know that I am deputized in 
their county, whether it be Denton 
County, Kaufman County, Collin Coun-
ty, Dallas County. I have to figure it 
out. That is just to register my neigh-
bors as a lawyer, as a voting rights 
lawyer, for me to help my neighbor get 
registered. 
If a voter would like to participate in 
the next election, they have to register 
at least 30 days before that election 
day. So if, like many young people, you 
decide that a week out from an elec-
tion you are fired up, you are ready to 
go, you want to vote in that election, 
guess what? You can’t. Because you 
didn’t get registered in time. 
Unlike many other States where they 
have same-day voter registration, in 
Texas you have to have decided 30 days 
out from the election that you were 
going to get registered and, hopefully, 
get through all of those other hoops. 
Right now, as we speak, the sec-
retary of State’s office is citing a paper 
shortage as the reason why they can’t 
print out enough voter registration 
forms, despite dragging their feet for 
years in expanding online voter reg-
istration for Texans. That is all just to 
get registered, Mr. Speaker. We are not 
even talking about casting your ballot 
yet. 
So after you have gone through those 
hoops, after you have gotten reg-
istered, you have to then survive the 
purges of the voter rolls that are going 
on right now, such as in 2019, when 
Texas attempted to kick 100,000 Tex-
ans—incorrectly—off the voter rolls 
claiming that they were noncitizens. It 
was such a disaster the secretary of 
State had to resign. 
Now, if you survived that, if you have 
gotten registered and you have not 
been purged from the voter rolls to ac-
tually cast your ballot, you have to 
jump through more hoops because 
Texas has the strictest voter ID law in 
the country. In order for me to vote in 
the State of Texas, I need to possess 
one of seven acceptable forms of ID 
which does include a Texas handgun li-
cense but does not include a student ID 
like my constituents at SMU, or UTD, 
or any school in Dallas might be 
issued. 
A Texas district court found in 2014 
that 600,000 registered Texans or 4.5 
percent of those registered at that time 
lacked one of these qualifying IDs. 
Now, thanks to a court ruling, you can 
sign a declaration stating that you 
don’t possess that required form of ID. 
But that is not often communicated at 
the polling place. I know because I 
have trained poll watchers to try and 
watch for this. When voters present 
themselves and they don’t have the re-
quired ID, they are often turned away. 
If you have a disability or if you are 
out of town, or you just have difficulty 
coming to a polling place, you can’t 
vote by mail very easily either. To vote 
by mail in the State of Texas you have 
to be 65 years or older, you have to be 
sick or disabled, or you have to be out 
of the county where your election is 
being 
held 
on 
election 
day 
and 
throughout the entire early voting pe-
riod. 
Recently, thanks to the State’s voter 
suppression law, S.B. 1, this has be-
come even more difficult. As reports 
from counties from across the State 
have shown, mail-in ballot applications 
are being rejected at an alarming rate. 
That is because this new law requires 
that people provide either a partial So-
cial Security number or a driver’s li-
cense number on their application for a 
mail-in ballot, and that number has to 
match the identification on their voter 
registration. This makes it extremely 
difficult for voters to remember which 
ID they used when they registered, per-
haps decades ago. 
In Dallas and Tarrant Counties right 
now, 40 percent, Mr. Speaker, of the ap-
plications have been rejected. In Bexar 
County where San Antonio is located, 
it is almost 50 percent. If these rejec-
tion rates hold, tens of thousands of 
mail-in ballots and possibly more will 
be rejected. 
It is now a crime, Mr. Speaker, for 
county officials to encourage folks to 
vote by mail, meaning that if you are 
in a household and you are married and 
if a spouse requests a mail-in ballot, 
the county official cannot inform you 
that your spouse can also request a 
mail-in ballot if they are eligible or 
they face criminal penalties. And that 
doesn’t even scratch the surface of 
dealing with voters whose names have 
changed because of marriage or di-
vorce, or a change in gender identity, 
or whose names no longer match the 
names on the voter roll. 
If you possess one of these IDs and if 
you are aware of your rights, you may 
still struggle to find a polling place. 
According to a report from the Leader-
ship Conference Education Fund, 750 
polling places have been closed in

Texas since 2012. This has dispropor-
tionately happened in counties with 
large Black and Latino populations. 
The law also curbed other initiatives 
by counties to make voting easier. 
That happened during the pandemic, 
including limiting ballot drop boxes, 
banning counties from drive-through 
voting, and opening 24-hour voting lo-
cations as they did in Harris County 
where Houston is. They even tried to 
ban Sunday morning early voting to 
stop souls to the polls until they had 
too much outrage and they had to back 
off. 
Texans in minority communities dis-
proportionately face long lines when 
they get to the polling place in order to 
vote. This includes one Black man in 
Houston who waited 6 hours to cast his 
ballot in 2020. 
If you make it through all of those 
hurdles: register to vote, cast your bal-
lot by mail or in person via early vot-
ing or on election day, your vote will 
then be diluted through aggressive par-
tisan gerrymandering at the State 
house, State senate, and congressional 
level. 
b 1230 
According to the Brennan Center for 
Justice, Texas Democrats would have 
to win 58 percent of the vote to be fa-
vored to carry more than 37 percent of 
the State’s congressional seats. That is 
a State where Joe Biden earned 46.5 
percent of the vote. 
According to this analysis, Texas 
would have to vote very heavily for 
Democrats in order to barely break the 
gerrymandering, and it would still 
likely leave Republicans with a 2-to-1 
seat advantage. 
This is all due to partisan gerry-
mandering, which allows politicians to 
choose their voters instead of the other 
way around. 
Gerrymandering doesn’t just silence 
communities, though. It also sup-
presses the vote. It is well known that 
competitive 
elections 
drive 
higher 
turnout, which is why the recent State 
and 
congressional 
maps 
in 
Texas 
sought to limit the number of competi-
tive elections as much as possible. 
For the Texas voter that has found a 
way to register and cast their ballot, 
and has ignored the impacts of gerry-
mandering, their vote is still under at-
tack, even after they have cast it. 
Currently, right now, as we are 2 
months out from the primary election 
for our next election, our State’s lead-
ers are conducting a so-called audit of 
the 2020 election results in our largest 
counties at the request of the former 
President of the United States, trying 
to prop up the lie that the last election 
was stolen from him—in a State that 
he won. 
All of these hurdles, combined with 
the potential discriminatory penalties, 
are making it difficult for the average 
Texan to feel that they can engage in 
an election freely. Even worse, States 
across the country are following Texas’ 
lead. That is why we need to pass the 
Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
The Freedom to Vote Act, just very 
quickly, for folks who are wondering, 
because there is a lot of discussion 
about this, this is what it actually 
does: 
It establishes automatic, online, and 
same-day 
voter 
registration, 
which 
would solve our voter registration 
problems in the State of Texas. 
It makes election day a Federal holi-
day, something that should happen. 
It sets national standards for early 
voting and vote by mail, requiring 2 
weeks of early voting, including 2 
weekends, and allowing any American 
who wants to, to vote by mail. 
It bans partisan gerrymandering and 
establishes clear, neutral standards 
and rules as well as increasing trans-
parency and enhanced judicial review. 
This would address Texas’ extremely 
gerrymandered maps. 
It creates a uniform standard for 
what forms of ID are acceptable for 
voting. 
It prevents States from subverting 
their own elections and protects elec-
tion records, legislation that I intro-
duced here in the House that I am glad 
to see included in this final bill. 
Of course, the Voting Rights Act 
needs to be restored. We need to make 
sure that we have preclearance again. 
We need to have a national standard. 
That is what the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Act does. 
This is a bill that passed the Senate 
98 to nothing in 2006. It passed the 
House overwhelmingly. It was signed 
into law by my constituent, again, 
George W. Bush, a Republican. Now, 
not a single Republican in the Senate 
or in the House will vote for it. 
This brings me to my final thoughts. 
On January 6, I was just a few rows 
back from where I am standing now. 
The doors to my right were barricaded 
with furniture like this, which we use 
to hold paper, as a mob tried to break 
in and prevent us from ratifying the re-
sults of an American Presidential elec-
tion. 
I along with my colleagues like Mr. 
JONES, who is here with me, were pre-
pared for the worst. These doors were 
locked. We didn’t know if there would 
be a way out. But we were determined 
to do our job. 
I think the most important thing 
that happened on January 6, the thing 
I hope that people remember that hap-
pened, isn’t that we had to evacuate 
the House floor. I hope they remember 
that we came back. 
We came back while there was still 
blood on the walls, while there was 
still broken glass on the floor, while we 
ourselves were dealing with our own 
emotional response to what had hap-
pened. While we ourselves were shaken, 
we came back and we voted—yes, in a 
bipartisan way—to affirm an American 
Presidential election. Our democracy 
held, just barely. 
Since then, we have seen a more clev-
er, slower attempt to accomplish the 
same thing that those rioters tried to 
do on January 6, which is to subvert 
the will of the American people. We 
have seen it in State after State. 
We have seen the worst rash of voter 
suppression laws that we have had in 
this country since the days of Jim 
Crow. In many ways, it is worse be-
cause it is not 1965, Mr. Speaker. It is 
2022, and we should have made more 
progress by now. We shouldn’t be hav-
ing this conversation about whether or 
not certain Americans should be able 
to vote in our elections. 
We have had this problem since the 
passage of the 15th Amendment, the 
idea that certain votes matter more 
than others, or that votes of certain 
people who live in certain places are 
inherently fraudulent, or that they 
don’t know enough to be involved in an 
election. 
I tell you what, I believe in the 
American people. I believe that they 
know that our democracy is what 
makes our country great. Our democ-
racy is what allows us to have this 
thriving economy. 
People are trying everything they 
can to get into this country still. They 
are not trying to join some of our auto-
cratic opponents. They are not trying 
to break into Russia or China. They 
want to come to the United States. We 
are still a beacon of hope for the world. 
When strongmen and autocrats worry 
about the United States, it is not just 
our military they worry about. It is 
our ideas. It is the idea of the United 
States. While that idea is under attack, 
I believe it is going to stand strong. 
I want to say, Mr. Speaker, to all of 
my constituents, to anyone who may 
be listening to this, the fight to protect 
the right to vote is far from over. The 
Senate may not have done its job yes-
terday, but I and my colleagues will 
not give up that fight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my friend and colleague, Con-
gressman ALLRED, for his leadership in 
the fight to protect the fundamental 
right to vote and to save our ailing de-
mocracy. It has been an honor working 
with him, with Congresswoman TERRI 
SEWELL, and with Congressman JOHN 
SARBANES over the past year on the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act and the Freedom to Vote 
Act. 
As you just heard, we are living 
through the worst assault on the right 
to vote since the Jim Crow era. And 
yesterday, on the Senate floor, white 
nationalists used the Jim Crow fili-
buster to block voting rights legisla-
tion. 
But they did not win the contest for 
the soul of our Nation. I rise to affirm 
that we the people aren’t giving up 
that easily. We never give up. 
We the people didn’t give up when, 
after we finally ended the scourge of 
slavery in this Nation, white national-
ists fought back, violently unraveling 
Reconstruction, throwing duly elected

Black people out of office, and barring 
Black voters from the voting booth for 
generations. We responded by orga-
nizing. 
Progress came in fits. It took us 
nearly a century, but progress came. 
It came in the courtroom where 
Thurgood Marshall helped to end a cen-
tury of legalized segregation. 
It came on the streets, where the 
March on Washington and the Mont-
gomery bus boycott produced meaning-
ful social change. 
Of course, it came in Congress where, 
after considerable pressure from the 
civil rights movement, this Chamber 
and the Senate passed the Voting 
Rights Act into law, and they over-
came a filibuster to do it. Imagine 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, like you, I was hoping 
against all hope that today’s story 
would end the same way, with a major-
ity of Senators doing the right thing. 
To those of you watching at home, to 
the millions of you who put it all on 
the line to save our democracy, to see 
the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act become law, I feel your pain right 
now. But I do not despair. As Sherrilyn 
Ifill, 
the 
director-counsel 
of 
the 
NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, said re-
cently: No story in the history of our 
quest for racial justice has ever ended 
with the words: ‘‘And then they gave 
up.’’ 
Our story, the story of building a 
true, multiracial democracy in the 21st 
century, is no exception. The fact is, 
progress is not always linear. It is 
messy. There are false starts. There are 
setbacks, like what happened last 
night. But the weight of history and 
the force of reason are on our side. 
I grew up in the Baptist Church. To 
quote from the book of Jeremiah: Like 
a fire shut up in my bones, I know that 
goodness will prevail. 
As the elders used to say: Trouble 
don’t 
last 
always. 
Weeping 
may 
endureth for a night, but joy—joy— 
cometh in the morning. 
Look at how far we have come al-
ready. Just a few years ago, democracy 
reform was a pipe dream embraced by 
only the most committed activists. But 
thanks 
to 
an 
overwhelming 
groundswell of energy, of movement 
building, of organizing, the Freedom 
To Vote: John R. Lewis Act passed the 
House, and it came just two votes short 
of passing the Senate. 
We are not going anywhere. We are 
more energized than ever to see this 
through. We must pick up Senate seats 
this fall to make the filibuster an im-
possibility. 
This is the fight of our lives, for our 
climate, for healthcare, our jobs, our 
dignity under the law, our future. We 
have no choice but to keep going. 
I am reminded of the words of Dr. 
King in his 1966 speech in Kingstree, 
South Carolina: 
‘‘Let us march on ballot boxes, for 
this is the way we are going to 
straighten up . . . the Nation. 
‘‘Let us march on ballot boxes until 
somehow we will be able to develop 
that day when men will have food and 
material necessities for their bodies, 
freedom and dignity for their spirits, 
education and culture for their minds. 
‘‘Let us march on ballot boxes so 
that men and women will no longer 
walk the streets in search of jobs that 
do not exist. 
‘‘Let us march on ballot boxes until 
the empty stomachs . . . are filled. 
‘‘Let us march on ballot boxes until 
the idle industries of Appalachia are 
revitalized. 
‘‘Let us march on ballot boxes until 
‘brotherhood’ is more than a meaning-
less word at the end of a prayer but the 
first order of business on every legisla-
tive agenda. 
‘‘Let us march on ballot boxes.’’ 
Dr. King’s words are as true today as 
they were nearly 60 years ago. But 
while our work must include the ballot 
box, we know that it also must go be-
yond it. We must envision the world as 
we want it, and we must do everything 
in our power to bring about that world. 
Hold your elected officials account-
able. Educate your friends, your fam-
ily, 
your 
neighbors. 
Change 
their 
hearts and minds. 
Mr. Speaker, unlike John Lewis and 
his generation, we are not called to 
risk our lives. We are merely called to 
exercise the rights that they helped to 
win: our votes and our voices. 
Like those before us, let us march on. 
b 1245 
REMEMBERING LANI GUINIER 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, as we 
grieve the demise of democracy legisla-
tion in the Senate last night, I rise in 
grief and in gratitude to honor my be-
loved teacher, the legendary Lani 
Guinier, who passed away earlier this 
month. 
Lani Guinier’s life defies summary. 
She began her career in the civil rights 
division at the Department of Justice. 
She led voting rights advocacy at the 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund, often 
driving alone at night through hostile 
places, like from Selma to Mobile, Ala-
bama, to win 31 of the 32 cases she ar-
gued. Due to her intellect and her ster-
ling record of accomplishment, she was 
nominated to lead the Civil Rights Di-
vision at the Department of Justice. 
She would go on to become the first 
woman of color tenured at Harvard 
Law School. 
But like many great civil rights lead-
ers, Lani Guinier did not define herself 
by the power she held or the acclaim 
she received. She defined herself by the 
power she unleashed within her clients, 
her students, and the American people. 
Lani Guinier found her voice by help-
ing others find theirs. 
I am blessed that she helped me find 
my voice. So the day after the Senate 
tried to silence the voices of the Amer-
ican people, it feels fitting to honor her 
by speaking from the floor of the peo-
ple’s House. 
I first met Professor Guinier when I 
was in college. I was taking a writing 
course, and with her characteristic 
generosity, she agreed to let me inter-
view her. At the time, I wanted to be a 
civil rights lawyer like my friend, 
COLIN ALLRED. That warm evening, the 
Sun still glowing in the sky, she illu-
minated a different path forward for 
me. She revealed to me that civil 
rights advocacy was about so much 
more than litigation, as important as 
that is. It was also about leveraging 
the power of impacted communities to 
transform entire institutions. Without 
meaning to, she helped persuade me to 
become a legislator. 
When I arrived at law school, Pro-
fessor Guinier taught me more than I 
could ever have expected, not just ev-
erything I know about voting rights 
law, but also how to become the person 
I hoped to be. 
As the first woman of color to be 
tenured at Harvard Law School, Pro-
fessor Guinier showed us that being a 
first is not a privilege but a responsi-
bility—a lesson that is not lost on me 
as one of the first openly gay Black 
Members of Congress. 
Her scholarship sought to show that 
every voice belonged in our constitu-
tional conversation. Not just John 
Marshall, but Thurgood Marshall. Not 
just lawyers like Constance Baker Mot-
ley, but activists like Fannie Lou 
Hamer. Not just the people whose 
names make the history books, but the 
seemingly ordinary people living lives 
of extraordinary service. 
While most law professors obsess 
over jurisprudence—what judges do, 
say, 
and 
think—Professor 
Guinier 
opened our eyes to demosprudence, the 
law that emerges from and enhances 
the power of the people. She knew that 
justice is not the work of Justices 
alone. 
At heart, Professor Guinier was a 
democratic idealist, a prophetic voice 
who called us to reconstruct our demo-
cratic institutions and reimagine our 
democratic identities. She cautioned 
us that winner-take-all elections risk 
converting political competition into 
mutually assured destruction, inten-
sifying conflict and underrepresenting 
those already underrepresented. 
She helped Congress reinvigorate sec-
tion 2 of the Voting Rights Act, work 
the Supreme Court subverted last year 
in Brnovich v. DNC, and which I was 
proud to help restore by introducing 
the Inclusive Elections Act, which we 
passed in the House but, unfortunately, 
the Senate rejected last night through 
the filibuster. 
After the Court demolished the Vot-
ing Rights Act’s foundation in Shelby 
v. Holder in 2013, she urged Congress to 
not only repair the damage—as we did 
in the House, but as was blocked last 
night by the Jim Crow filibuster—but 
she also encouraged us to guarantee an 
affirmative right to vote. I have been 
honored to answer that call by intro-
ducing the Right to Vote Act, which 
also passed the House last week as part 
of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act. 
Beyond prescribing specific reforms 
and remedies, Professor Guinier urged

us to see that democracy was not a 
zero-sum war over the power to domi-
nate but, rather, a delicate project of 
sharing power with one another as 
equals. ‘‘Living in a democracy,’’ she 
said, ‘‘is not something we inherit. It is 
not something we inhabit, and it is not 
something that we consume. It is 
something we actively build together.’’ 
Just as the Senate refused to heed 
the will of the people last night, the 
powerful did not always heed Professor 
Guinier. But she knew the power of dis-
sent. Whether dissenters speak from 
the bench, from the lectern like this 
one, or from the streets, what seems 
like their weakness is really their 
strength. The powerful coerce us to do 
their bidding, but dissenters call us for-
ward to freely do what is right. 
I 
am 
heartbroken 
by 
Professor 
Guinier’s passing. I miss her. 
But Professor Guinier, even now, 
shows me that accepting myself as I 
am can help me to center the people I 
serve. She inspires me to protect and 
perfect our multiracial democracy. I 
once asked her how to advance that 
mission in today’s times. She said, ‘‘I 
think that is the question for your gen-
eration.’’ With our democracy on the 
line, may we, the people, lift every 
voice to answer. 
Mr. ALLRED. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New York for his 
words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities against Mem-
bers of the United States Senate. 
f 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief, and I will 
speak at the end of the Special Order 
as well if there is time. 
Mr. Speaker, in 1973 the U.S. Su-
preme Court abandoned women and ba-
bies to what is now the multibillion 
dollar abortion industry, and almost 
631⁄2 million unborn children have been 
killed, a staggering loss of children’s 
lives that is more than the entire popu-
lation of Italy. 
Now, by at least affirming the con-
stitutionality of the Mississippi law 
after 15 weeks, which we are all hoping 
and praying for, the Supreme Court 
may finally take a powerful step to-
wards inclusion, respect, and justice 
for the weakest and most vulnerable 
nearly 50 years after the infamous find-
ings of Roe v. Wade. 
Tomorrow thousands will march for 
life here in the capital and across the 
country. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HARRIS), who is a medical 
doctor, an anesthesiologist at Johns 
Hopkins, and co-chairman of the Pro- 
Life Caucus. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with the hope that after nearly 
50 years, Roe v. Wade’s attack on the 
most basic of human rights, the right 
to life, will soon meet its end. 
Why are we going to be marching to-
morrow? We do it because we believe 
that every person, born and unborn, de-
serves a chance at life. We march to 
shed light on the incredible resources 
available to expectant mothers who 
find themselves in desperate situa-
tions. We march to send a message that 
humanity cannot sit by and quietly 
tolerate 
the 
deliberate 
ending 
of 
human life. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a physician, and I 
have helped thousands of women de-
liver their babies over the course of my 
career. When I underwent my training, 
I was taught that caring for expectant 
mothers meant caring for two patients, 
not one. As you can see here, advances 
in ultrasound technology have rein-
forced that training from decades ago. 
Mr. Speaker, these are not blobs of tis-
sue we are talking about. These are 
human beings. The science is clear: 
From the moment of conception, new 
human life enters the world with its 
own unique DNA, and in a matter of 
weeks even a heartbeat. 
Mr. Speaker, we march for an end to 
the human tragedy of abortion, and I 
pray each day that we come closer to 
this righteous conclusion. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH), co- 
chair of the Pro-Life Caucus. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my great friend, Mr. SMITH, and 
a great fighter for life for many years, 
and we appreciate all of his work on 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 
49th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade 
tragedy and to remember the more 
than 60 million unborn lives it has 
taken and the tragic, irreversible mark 
it has left on countless mothers, fa-
thers, and families. 
Every innocent life is precious, from 
conception until natural death, but for 
nearly five decades abortion has re-
mained one of the greatest tragedies of 
our Nation. 
The Supreme Court now has the op-
portunity to right some of the terrible 
wrongs committed in this country 
against the unborn since Roe v. Wade. 
I pray for our Justices, that they make 
the right decision, for many lives will 
depend on it. 
We will continue to fight for the lives 
of unborn children. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mrs. FISCHBACH for 
her powerful and eloquent witness for 
life, both in the legislature in Min-
nesota and now in the U.S. House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). I would note 
that he is the prime author of two 
breakthrough laws. One is called the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, which 
is law, and the Born-Alive Infants Pro-
tection Act. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for his 
long-time leadership in protecting in-
nocent, unborn lives. He was here at 
the beginning. The fathers of the pro- 
life movement here in the United 
States Congress were CHRIS SMITH and 
Henry Hyde. 
Speaking of Henry Hyde, we have had 
for a long time something called the 
Hyde amendment, which basically said 
U.S. tax dollars could not go to pay for 
abortions, but we have a radical pro- 
abortion group of people that control 
this Congress now. They think that tax 
dollars ought to go to pay for other 
people’s abortions. 
They also believe that not only 
should we pay for abortions here in the 
United States with the people’s tax 
dollars, but they ought to pay for abor-
tions across the globe, and that is a re-
versal of the Mexico City policy. 
The Supreme Court is currently con-
sidering two cases that may fundamen-
tally alter abortion in this country, 
and it is my hope, my sincere hope, 
that this Court will finally right a 
grievous past wrong and give the rights 
to the most vulnerable among us, the 
unborn, and protect lives in the future 
rather than what has happened in the 
slaughter of over 63 million of our fel-
low citizens. 
I want to thank Mr. SMITH and all 
the other Members who will be speak-
ing here today for their leadership on 
this vital, vital issue. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
just say how much I appreciate the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) for having this very, very valu-
able worthwhile Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the memory of the 63 million babies 
who have tragically been aborted since 
the Supreme Court’s devastating deci-
sion in Roe v. Wade. 
However, in the 49 years since that 
fatal decision, science has unmistak-
ably proven that unborn babies can feel 
pain as early as 15 weeks. They even 
have a character. We can see it on 
sonograms. 
But the left likes to ignore this fact. 
They seem to only value the type of 
science that supports their political 
agenda. It is time for the ‘‘party of 
science’’ to actually follow the science 
and to protect the unborn. 
I will always fight for life. I am proud 
to be up here with my colleagues today 
standing up for these unborn, innocent, 
little human beings. I sincerely pray 
that the Supreme Court of the United 
States will make the just decision to 
overturn Roe v. Wade this very year. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN), my friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
honored to be here with my colleagues

who believe so fervently in doing the 
right thing because if you seek your 
wisdom from above, you will always do 
the right thing. I appreciate Mr. 
SMITH’s leadership. 
As we stand here remembering the 
49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I want 
to remind my colleagues that standing 
for life—and I repeat, standing for 
life—has historically been a bipartisan 
effort. Example, the Hyde amendment, 
especially across Michigan’s First Dis-
trict. 
Since coming to Congress, I am proud 
to have stood shoulder to shoulder with 
my constituents as we collectively 
raise our voice, and our vote, for those 
who have neither. 
b 1300 
The very first inalienable right de-
scribed in the Declaration of Independ-
ence is the right to life. 
As a Member of Congress I have al-
ways and will always continue to fight 
to correct that right for the born and 
the unborn. 
Protecting life isn’t an issue of divi-
sion. In fact, it is one of unity. 
We must all work together to enact 
better policies and build stronger com-
munities that create a culture of life. 
Together, we can create a Nation 
that honors life and upholds the self- 
evident truth that every life is precious 
and must be protected. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership. 
I yield to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. JOHNSON), a distinguished 
attorney before coming to Congress 
and number four in the line of leader-
ship in the Republican Party. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
principal leadership on this issue for so 
many years. He is a great model to us 
all. 
Mr. Speaker, we in the Pro-Life Cau-
cus are happy to join the March for 
Life tomorrow here in the Nation’s 
capital, but we are here today to ac-
knowledge the tragic anniversary of 
Roe v. Wade. 
As has been said, more than 63 mil-
lion unborn children have been denied 
their right to life in the past 49 years 
since that tragic decision was handed 
down. 
As we fight to protect the liberties of 
all Americans here in Congress, we 
have to remember to fight first for the 
most defenseless, and that is the child 
in the womb, who from the moment of 
conception is a unique human being 
with unique DNA. 
In the coming months you are going 
to hear a lot of vague and euphemistic 
language from defenders of abortion. 
Do not be swayed. The truth is very 
simple, and it has never changed. Abor-
tion takes a baby’s life, a person made 
in God’s image. 
We hope, we pray, we believe that 
2022 is the year the Supreme Court will 
finally recognize this truth once again. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. JOYCE), a medical doctor. 
So many of our leaders in the pro-life 
effort both in this Congress and legisla-
tion across the country are medical 
doctors and healthcare professionals. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
New Jersey, Mr. SMITH, for his leader-
ship in this incredibly important issue. 
Year after year he has stood for the un-
born. Personally I want to thank him 
for that leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, in the 49 years since the 
case of Roe v. Wade was ruled on by the 
Supreme Court, 63 million innocent un-
born children have lost their lives to 
abortion. 
Now, members of the radical left are 
trying to raise the number of abortions 
performed in the United States by re-
pealing the Hyde amendment, which 
for decades has ensured that no tax-
payer dollars are used to fund this bar-
baric procedure. 
As a doctor, I swore an oath to ‘‘first, 
do no harm.’’ 
When I was in medical school I swore 
that I would never perform, assist, or 
support an abortion procedure. As a 
medical student, as an intern, as a resi-
dent, and as a board certified physician 
for 25 years, I lived up to that pledge. 
As a legislator in the United States 
Congress I took a pledge to continue to 
stand for life. 
Now is the time for Congress to pass 
legislation that defends the rights of 
the unborn. 
Now is the time for us to end abor-
tions in this country. 
On this 49th anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade let us remember the lives that 
have been lost and recommit ourselves 
to defending human life. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank 
you very much, doctor, for your leader-
ship and eloquence. 
I yield to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. We can all agree 
that it is wrong to murder a person, 
Mr. Speaker, or in other words to take 
someone’s life. So my pro-abortion col-
leagues need to answer the simple 
question of when does a little baby 
girl’s life start? 
Does it start at 6 weeks when the 
baby girl’s heart starts beating? Most 
pro-abortion advocates oppose the 6- 
week heartbeat laws, so they would not 
consider a heartbeat to be life. What 
about when a little baby girl can start 
to feel pain around the halfway point 
in pregnancy? Not a single House Dem-
ocrat 
cosponsored 
legislation 
that 
would affect babies who can feel pain, 
so it seems they don’t believe in life at 
the halfway point either. 
What about at 21 weeks, Mr. Speaker, 
when the baby girl could potentially 
survive outside the womb thanks to 
lifesaving 
medical 
technology? 
It 
seems simple to say if she could live 
outside the womb, she must be alive in-
side the womb, as well. Yet most pro- 
abortion advocates still say we should 
be able to kill her without a second 
thought. 
Many of my pro-abortion colleagues 
also believe we should be able to abort 
viable babies even up through birth. 
Why should abortion doctors be al-
lowed to kill a baby who has developed 
organs, a beating heart, and even the 
ability to recognize the sound of their 
own mother’s voice? There is no excuse 
for aborting babies at birth, but the 
pro-abortion movement believes this 
murder should be allowed anyway. 
It is time my pro-abortion colleagues 
start following the science and realize 
those little babies are human, alive, 
and worthy of life. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SMITH for 
the incredible work he is doing. He 
may not get his rewards here, but I as-
sure you he will in Heaven. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from New Jersey for his 
leadership on this issue and for yield-
ing me time. 
Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 49th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court’s de-
cision in Roe v. Wade my colleagues 
and I come together to remember the 
more than 63 million children who have 
had their lives cut short in this coun-
try since 1973. 
I stand here today for the sake of the 
women, for the sake of the children, 
and for the sake of the very future of 
our Nation. 
Because of Roe v. Wade and the cases 
that followed its precedent, the right of 
the unborn to be born is denied 
throughout our Nation more than 2,000 
times every single day, and in several 
States throughout all 9 months of preg-
nancy, which Roe permits. 
This is a great stain on this great Na-
tion. 
We will not be silent here in Con-
gress, nor will the hundreds of millions 
of pro-life Americans across this coun-
try. 
My colleagues and I will continue to 
stand for life and fight to end the trag-
edy that is abortion. 
We will remain steadfast supporters 
of life and serve as voices for the voice-
less and defenders of the defenseless. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
strong statement. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for 
taking the lead on such an important 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, on the 49th anniversary 
of Roe v. Wade, let’s reflect on the im-
portance of standing up for every 
human being’s right to realize their 
full potential from the moment of con-
ception. 
In fact, Members of Congress have a 
solemn duty to defend those incapable 
of defending themselves, the most in-
nocent among us, the unborn. 
I will share a little bit of a personal 
story when my family chose life. This 
was when my son was 3 years old. He

was involved in an accident with a 
head injury, and he was on life support. 
And many times the doctors told us he 
wasn’t going to survive. In fact, they 
said it is not an 80 percent chance, not 
a 95 percent chance, but it was a 100 
percent chance that he was going to 
pass. We did not disconnect life sup-
port. 
We 
chose 
life. 
We 
prayed. 
And 
Freddie started to recover. 
Today Freddie is fully recovered, and 
though his accident was decades ago, 
this is an opportunity to learn about 
the value of human life. 
Our creator has a plan for each one of 
us, and I will continue to support poli-
cies that ensure every life has the 
chance to realize its fullest potential. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
sharing that beautiful story about his 
son Freddie. 
I yield to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN), another good friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for all 
his great work on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 
49th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, a dev-
astating decision that we have contin-
ued to remind you has killed 63 million 
children in this country. 
Who do we trust on this issue? There 
it says: ‘‘In God We Trust.’’ So if that 
is the case, this is what God said to 
Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1:5: I knew you 
before I formed you in the womb. So 
what more evidence do we need? 
This shouldn’t be a political debate, 
but now my Democratic friends are 
taking it one step further by attempt-
ing to abolish the Hyde amendment, 
which prevents taxpayer money from 
funding abortions. The government 
should not be using hard-earned tax-
payer money to kill innocent children. 
However, I am optimistic that the 
fight for life will take a step in the 
right direction. 
The Supreme Court is currently re-
viewing Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization, a lawsuit chal-
lenging a Mississippi law that bans 
abortion after 15 weeks. 
I pray that the judges will rule in 
favor of life. 
As the father of four and the grand-
father of 14, I believe that life is pre-
cious, and I will fight to protect that 
life. 
I have taken an oath to fight for life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, 
and so has every Member of this body. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his 
comments. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. 
LESKO. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
you 
wouldn’t believe it, but as I was walk-
ing here today to speak about the 
value of life, my daughter called me, 
and she is headed to the hospital to 
give birth to my fifth grandchildren, 
my second granddaughter. So isn’t this 
an appropriate depiction right here of 
my next granddaughter, who is going 
to be named Grace. 
I used to be what they call pro-choice 
years ago. But I was lied to. You know, 
they said it was just a clump of cells, 
just some tissues, looked like a tad-
pole, nothing. But, you know, as tech-
nology has gotten better, we now have 
ultrasounds, and in our State of Ari-
zona we passed legislation so that the 
mothers could see what their babies 
really look like. They have little 
hands, little fingers, little toes. They 
are humans. They are real people. They 
are not just a clump of cells. And that 
is why it is so disturbing to me that 
here in the U.S. Congress I don’t think 
we have one of my Democratic col-
leagues left that is pro-life. I think 
they got rid of them in the primaries. 
And when Republicans have come 
forward and asked the Speaker of the 
House, please, can we vote on a bill 
that requires medical help to be given 
to babies that are born alive in a 
botched abortion, she said ‘‘no.’’ What 
has this country come to when we 
don’t even want to keep a baby alive 
after it is born? 
My fellow Republicans and I are 
fighting hard for the value of life to 
protect the preborn, to protect every 
life. This is the most important thing 
that we can do. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her remarks and wish her congratula-
tions. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mon-
tana (Mr. ROSENDALE). 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for being a lead-
ing example on this charge for us. 
Tomorrow will be a unique and sig-
nificant day. Tomorrow many of us 
will take the unfortunately similar 
steps of a march that began in 1974. 
This March for Life however may be 
the last one before the stain of Roe v. 
Wade is lifted from this Nation. 
However, even if we are so fortunate, 
the decision to continue this crime will 
likely remain in many of the States. 
Sadly, millions of Americans have 
yet to awaken, awaken to the cruelty 
and the evil that is abortion. The rea-
son for this slumber is no less dev-
astating than the murder of 63 million 
children. It is the failure to recognize 
the inherent dignity of every life. This 
failure has justified the intentional 
killing of a living child, led to the 
many atrocities of the 21st century and 
this American tragedy. We, however, 
are not reconciled to continue this 
moral failing. 
I often think about the abortionist 
who has woken up to the evil which he 
has been so complicit in. That moment 
when his heart converts, when he has 
been availed of the truth inherent in 
human life. He looks back at the trail 
of broken bodies that he has traveled. 
But if we stop there at the horror and 
the tragedy, we would not have hope 
because we know that when he looks 
up he now sees those glorified souls 
looking down on him, singing in praise 
and rejoicing in his conversion. 
b 1315 
There is renewal in our movement, 
and there is hope. There is the hopeful 
anticipation that everyone in every 
State will also see the obvious truth 
and the inherent beauty in the tiniest 
life. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for including me in this Special Order 
today. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
comments and leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), a good 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I may have a slightly 
different tone here. I was born in an 
unwed mother’s home in downtown 
L.A., and so were all my siblings. In 
my late thirties, I got an email out of 
nowhere, and it said: Hi, David. I am a 
friend of your sister’s. Here is your in-
formation. Here is your birth mother. 
We had a family discussion. I sent a 
very carefully worded note, and a cou-
ple of weeks later, I got this phone call, 
this tiny voice crying—and I am crying 
now also on the phone. And she is say-
ing: I go to mass almost every day. On 
your birthday, I am terrified. Are you 
having a good life? How has your world 
been? 
And I am crying on the other side, 
basically saying: Look, I have had a 
great life. I got adopted by a family 
that brought me to Arizona. I get to 
live in the Phoenix area. I have a won-
derful brother and sister, who were also 
born in the unwed mother’s home. 
It became an amazing experience. My 
mom, who is right here, and this is my 
birth mom right here, they became 
best of friends. I have never told this 
part of the story here, but my birth 
mom—both of them have now passed 
away—had 
an 
early 
type 
of 
Alz-
heimer’s, a type of dementia. But my 
mom here had sent her all sorts of 
photos of me being a child. So when 
you go into the house that they had 
there in California, there would be my 
two 6’ tall blonde half sisters and then 
pictures of me as a baby growing up. 
In her mind, I was always there. I 
was always part of the family. The dear 
Lord does heal. 
But one of her best friends at the fu-
neral turned to me and said: David, did 
Mary Lynn ever tell you the story of 
when we were in the car on the way to 
Tijuana to go get an abortion? 
As they got closer and closer to the 
border, she began to cry. Then they got 
closer, 
and 
she 
started 
to 
hyperventilate. Eventually, she be-
came so crushed with fear and sadness 
and terror, the girls turned around and 
went back and talked to her mother. A 
few months later, I was born at that 
Holy Family Unwed Mothers Home. 
Now I am this age, and I have an 
adopted little girl, who is the third 
generation adopted in our family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H281 
January 20, 2022 
For those of us who passionately care 
about life, I think it is important we 
also tell the stories of how grateful 
some of us are to be alive; the amazing 
life my little girl is having and how 
grateful I am to her birth mom for giv-
ing us the greatest gift my wife and I 
have ever had; and understanding that 
the ultimate definition of love is life. 
Maybe others out there can have the 
amazing experience I have had with 
meeting my birth family and my fam-
ily and my siblings’ birth families. It is 
just one amazing experience of joy of 
life. 
That needs to be what, I think, we 
focus on. There is good here if we just 
change our hearts and our minds. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman so 
much for sharing that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Idaho (Mr. FULCHER), my good 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague from New Jer-
sey. It is an honor to join my col-
leagues here during this special week. 
Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, I ap-
proached the podium for the first time 
to give my speech on the House floor. I 
chose my topic intentionally as it is an 
issue that I will always champion: pro-
tecting the lives of the unborn. There 
is no effort more worthy than sup-
porting life. This issue defines our cul-
ture, our society, and our value sys-
tem. 
Every year, I am overwhelmed at the 
outpouring of effort, energy, and sup-
port that floods this cause. So thank 
you, and thank you to my colleagues in 
the House and Senate who join me in 
this fight. Thank you to the health 
practitioners working nonstop to pro-
vide resources to help new mothers 
choose life. Thanks to our advocates on 
the ground, from the airwaves to in- 
person, for continually showing your 
support. And thank you to our pastors 
and religious organizations for seeking 
divine guidance and strength in this ef-
fort. 
I am inspired by you all and will keep 
doing everything I can to continue this 
fight to protect the unborn. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. LATTA), and I thank 
him for his leadership on his pending 
bill. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from New Jersey for his 
years of unending work for the unborn. 
He has been so steadfast that, from the 
bottom of my heart, I thank him for all 
he has done. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the 
tragedy of abortion is the greatest 
human rights issue of our day. The 
right to life is the foundation upon 
which all other rights are built. The 
science is clear: Abortion ends a human 
life. 
Studies have proven chemical abor-
tion puts the life of the mother in 
great danger. In 2015, one in three 
women who took the abortion drug 
ended up in the emergency room within 
30 days. Let me repeat that. One in 
three women who took the abortion 
drug ended up in the emergency room 
within 30 days. 
Congress must do more to provide 
women and their unborn children with 
care and support. I am proud that my 
legislation, the SAVE Moms and Ba-
bies Act, would prevent the FDA from 
approving new abortion drugs and 
would stop these dangerous pills from 
being dispensed through telemedicine. 
I would like to thank everyone in 
Washington, D.C., this week who is of-
fering their unwavering dedication to 
defending the unborn despite a culture 
that often marginalizes pro-life values. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO), my 
friend and colleague and leader in the 
pro-life movement as well. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for 
putting on this very, very Special 
Order so we can address a very serious 
issue that is plaguing our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 
anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a standard 
of unparalleled violence against an in-
nocent population in this country. The 
biggest casualty caused by Roe v. Wade 
are the 62 million children killed before 
they had a chance. 
Our forefathers believed that every 
man, woman, and child has a God-given 
right to life. Our Constitution makes 
no caveat for only those who can walk, 
talk, and speak. 
Because of my children and my faith, 
protecting life is a very personal re-
sponsibility to me. As a Catholic, I can 
testify how faith encourages strength 
of character, urges truthfulness, and 
prioritizes the sanctity of life. 
The sad truth is that you will find 
many of the politicians claiming to be 
religious actively rejecting each of 
these 
faith-founded 
principles. 
The 
most basic way to exercise faith is by 
adhering to the Ten Commandants, in-
cluding thou shalt not kill. 
I appreciate all of my friends and col-
leagues in Congress who are standing 
up and speaking up for those who can-
not today. I am grateful to know that 
there are Americans who will speak 
and fight alongside me on behalf of 
millions of unborn babies who cannot 
defend themselves. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman very 
much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I have always felt the 
1960s was where America went off the 
rails. Of course, Roe v. Wade wasn’t de-
cided in exactly the 1960s, but the 1960s 
really, I think, began with the assas-
sination of President Kennedy. You 
would say the end of that disastrous 
decade was January 22, 1973, where the 
Supreme Court decided that abortion 
was legal in the United States of Amer-
ica. Just a disaster. 
Since then, 63 million unborn chil-
dren have died in every State. Ten 
years before that, abortion would have 
been considered illegal. All churches 
would have been appalled by it, and all 
Americans knew it was just a horrible 
thing. But then, in an example of out- 
of-control judiciary, probably the most 
extreme example in our country, the 
U.S. Supreme Court came in and began 
a reign in which 63 million unborn chil-
dren have lost their lives. 
The U.S. is one of seven countries 
where late-term abortions are illegal. 
We stand with Vietnam, North Korea, 
Red China, together with Singapore, 
Canada, and the Netherlands. We are 
one of the few countries in the world, 
after all God has given us, that we de-
cide to step up and say it is appropriate 
to kill a child right up to birth. 
In any event, today, we mourn the 
anniversary of Roe v. Wade. We look 
forward to leaving this Chamber and 
marching in the March for Life, as we 
hope that this is finally—given that 
there is an important Supreme Court 
decision coming down—finally the end, 
or the beginning of the end, of this on-
going slaughter of the innocent in the 
United States. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for re-
minding us that the Chinese Com-
munist Party and North Korea both 
have policies like ours, especially as it 
relates to up-to-birth abortions. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague from New Jer-
sey (Mr. SMITH) for being a stalwart 
leader on this ever since I have been in-
volved in this. I appreciate him for 
being courageous and strong on defend-
ing life. 
Mr. Speaker, as we know, in the 49 
years since the Supreme Court codified 
Roe v. Wade, the science behind preg-
nancy and its diagnosis, so to speak, 
has advanced exponentially. We know 
this year the Supreme Court will rule 
on a case called Dobbs v. Jackson to 
decide on limiting abortion access to 15 
weeks of pregnancy. 
As if there has been any doubt, real-
ly, of what a pregnancy means com-
monsense-wise, that it is a child devel-
oping—not a blob, a tissue mass, a 
clump of cells, or a baby giraffe. No, it 
is a human being. 
Medical 
advancements 
like 
ultrasounds since that decision 49 
years ago, prenatal surgeries, all these 
have shown the humanity of the un-
born, which points to the value of life 
from the moment of conception, from 
that flash of light. 
By 15 weeks in the womb, babies have 
fully developed hearts, can taste, can 
make facial expressions, and can feel 
pain. With today’s medical advance-
ments, a baby can survive outside the 
womb, incredibly, at 22 weeks and, in

some cases, even earlier with aggres-
sive care and maybe a little bit of luck 
and God’s blessing. 
Roe v. Wade allows a baby to be born 
as late as 28 weeks. At 28 weeks, a baby 
is a living, breathing, developed person 
with thoughts and a future. We need 
revisions to Roe v. Wade. The future of 
our Nation, its morality, its outlook, it 
depends on it. Abortion is a gruesome 
act that destroys families, harms wom-
en’s health, mentally and physically, 
and takes the life of the innocent. 
I will always fight for the unborn, 
the sanctity of life, and our traditional 
family values this country is founded 
upon. It is truly a cornerstone, and it is 
abhorrent that lives like this can be 
taken needlessly when we have so 
many remedies. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership all these many years. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this weekend, tens of 
thousands of men and women will fill 
the streets of our Capital to march for 
the lives of the unborn and to advocate 
for the rights of the most vulnerable 
Americans. 
These men and women are advo-
cating for an end to abortion, but they 
are not just seeking policy solutions. I 
know many of the devoted participants 
in the March for Life and about all the 
work they do in our communities to 
make sure that no woman ever feels 
alone or that abortion is her only op-
tion. 
b 1330 
They staff pregnancy centers, host 
diaper drives, provide information on 
adoptions, and organize childcare for 
young mothers. They are doing the 
work of making their cities and neigh-
borhoods a place where no one is alone 
and there is a support system for every 
mother. There is sensitive and compas-
sionate help available to those facing 
an unwanted pregnancy. 
Mr. Speaker, as we march for life this 
weekend, we march for a greater future 
for all of us, one that values the un-
born and sees the potential in every 
life. I am proud to support, champion, 
and stand with these efforts. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now 
yield to the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Tennessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER), 
who is also a pharmacist. 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, 
my belief in God and my Christian 
faith, they are the catalyst for every 
decision I make. Remarkable Ameri-
cans from across the country are gath-
ering this week in Washington, D.C., to 
advocate for the protection of unborn 
children. 
Written into the Declaration of Inde-
pendence is our founding faith and 
principle that we are all created by 
God, created equally, endowed by our 
creator with the unalienable rights to 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. However, since the infamous Su-
preme Court decision of Roe v. Wade 
some 49 years ago, we have fallen short 
of that national edict by not acknowl-
edging that life at every stage is pre-
cious, valuable, sacred, and should be 
protected. 
To the many Americans marching in 
person this week and supporting the 
pro-life 
movement 
through 
other 
means, I want to say thank you for 
your dedication to this most worthy 
cause and know that you are not alone 
in this fight. As you continue to stand 
up for those who cannot stand up for 
themselves, remember that my pro-life 
colleagues and I stand with you. 
Mr. Speaker, I promise to use this 
platform right here in Congress and be-
yond 
to 
continue 
my 
vocal 
and 
unapologetic advocacy for unborn chil-
dren. I will not stop fighting until our 
laws and policies protect life at every 
stage. I hope you won’t either. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT), a friend 
and colleague for several decades. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to recognize my colleagues this solemn 
day. It is the day we commemorate the 
anniversary of Roe v. Wade. I have said 
it before and continue to say, as I have 
many times, I am pro-life. I am pro- 
family. I am pro-child. I join my col-
leagues and constituents in Alabama’s 
Fourth Congressional District in re-
membering the, literally, millions of 
babies that have been aborted since 
that 1973 decision. 
Mr. Speaker, this year we are pos-
sibly 
on 
the 
brink 
of 
a 
trans-
formational moment in our history, a 
moment of hope that we really haven’t 
had for many, many years, the reversal 
of or major changes to Roe v. Wade. 
As most of us know, in June of this 
year we expect the U.S. Supreme Court 
to hand down a decision on the Dobbs 
v. Jackson case. In deciding this case, 
the Supreme Court has the opportunity 
to protect the lives of unborn children 
after the 15-week mark of pregnancy. 
Mr. Speaker, I think we all have to 
be clear. Even if the Supreme Court up-
holds the Mississippi law as it is writ-
ten, abortion will not be banned na-
tionwide. It simply gives the power 
back to the States. For me, my pro-life 
stance is deeply rooted in my Christian 
faith. Just as important, my opposition 
to abortion is about doing what is 
right. It is about protecting unborn ba-
bies. It is about not trying to impose 
my faith on anyone else. 
Mr. Speaker, that is because it is also 
rooted 
in 
science. 
Like 
much 
of 
science, our scope of knowledge on the 
development of unborn babies has ad-
vanced farther than what we knew 
back in 1973. It is time for our laws to 
catch up. 
At 15 weeks, an unborn baby has a 
heartbeat. It can open and close its fin-
gers and hands. It can taste. It can 
even feel pain. No argument in favor of 
abortion can overcome one unchanging 
fact, and that is abortion stops a beat-
ing heart. 
Given developments of unborn babies 
at 15 weeks, abortions after this time-
frame often involve gruesome medical 
procedures that are dangerous for 
mothers and undoubtedly painful to 
the baby. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues, as we look forward, as we re-
turn back to our States, and as this 
issue is hopefully turned over into the 
hands of the States, we can make 
groundbreaking steps in saving the 
lives of the unborn. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now 
yield to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to offer my reasoning for voting to pro-
tect unborn American citizens. I be-
lieve that life begins at conception 
which is why I support adoptions, fos-
ter care, and crisis pregnancy centers 
that work tirelessly to care for moth-
ers and babies. 
Kansans are leading the way in pro-
tecting the right to life by placing the 
Value Them Both amendment on the 
ballot, this year’s response to the Kan-
sas Supreme Court’s unthinkable rul-
ing that abortion is a constitutional 
right. For my part, I have cosponsored 
pro-life legislation including H.R. 18, 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion 
Act, permanently prohibiting Federal 
funding for abortions and abortion 
services. I have introduced my own 
H.R. 714 which would require the execu-
tive branch to notify Congress and the 
American public before issuing any 
new executive order pertaining to pro- 
life provisions. 
Mr. Speaker, abortion has desen-
sitized our Nation. I pray we wake up 
soon and repent for the horrors we have 
visited upon America’s most vulner-
able, the unborn. Imagine what this 
country would look like economically, 
culturally, socially, and spiritually if 
abortion hadn’t wiped out an entire 
generation of Americans, 63.4 million 
people over the last 50 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all 
of you who have joined together in this 
fight. Thank you for using your voices 
to defend the voiceless. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I now rec-
ognize the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. THOMPSON). As I said before, 
there are doctors who are outspoken in 
their defense of life, Dr. Thompson is 
one of those. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today during this 
Special Order to reaffirm my commit-
ment to protect and defend the sanc-
tity of life. 
From the moment I stepped foot into 
this Chamber in 2009, I submitted my 
promise to protect our most vulner-
able, the unborn. In this Congress I 
have cosponsored 11 bills and signed on 
to eight letters relating to pro-life 
policies. 
Our Founders enshrined in the Dec-
laration 
of 
Independence 
three 
unalienable rights. The first is the 
right to life. Sadly, from the moment 
of the Roe v. Wade decision, the basic

right to life has been denied to more 
than 60 million unborn children. We 
don’t know what those children would 
have grown up to do. Perhaps they 
would have cured cancer, found a solu-
tion to Alzheimer’s. The possibilities 
are endless with the loss of those lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with 
so many of my colleagues. We know 
that there is hope on the horizon. The 
life movement is strong, and I look for-
ward to continuing to advocate on be-
half of pro-life policies. It is my hope 
that one day those unalienable rights 
will extend to all Americans born and 
unborn. It is my prayer that this will 
be the last march for life with Roe v. 
Wade being the law of the land. When 
we march next year, it will be in cele-
bration for what we have accomplished 
for the protection of the unborn. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD), a 
good friend and colleague. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in defense of life. 
This Saturday, as many of the pre-
vious speakers had alluded to, is the 
49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. As 
such, it is a fitting time to talk about 
this administration’s radical anti-life 
policies for which some of us were 
caught off guard when President Biden 
was running for the Presidency. 
Over the past year we have watched 
President Biden and the Democrats 
continually push what I would consider 
an anti-life full agenda. First, they 
gutted the Hyde amendment, a long-
standing provision of appropriations 
bills that prevents taxpayer funding for 
abortions and has saved an estimated 2 
million lives. 
Then the Biden Administration’s De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices changed the rules to essentially re-
quire healthcare providers to perform 
abortions, despite any moral objections 
they may have. 
Finally, my Democrat colleagues 
passed a radical bill that removes ex-
isting limits on abortion and allows 
abortions on demand, no matter the 
age of the fetus. 
Mr. Speaker, I will always push back 
on their anti-life stances with a clear 
and strong message of full opposition. I 
believe that every human life is pre-
cious and should be protected at every 
stage. Throughout my career, I have 
always stood for life. I will continue to 
fight 
against 
this 
administration’s 
anti-life policies. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, today, after decades of noble 
struggle and sacrifice, pro-life Ameri-
cans are hopeful that government-sanc-
tioned violence against children and 
the exploitation of women by abortion 
may be nearing an end, although in a 
very real way the struggle to defend in-
nocent human life now enters a criti-
cally important new phase. 
Because of the Dobbs case, because 
the Supreme Court has finally seem-
ingly accepted a relook at Roe v. Wade 
and subsequent decisions, the Federal 
Government and the States-based suit 
have new authority to protect the 
weakest 
and 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
among us. Protection for unborn chil-
dren is at a tipping point. In 2022, the 
Supreme Court can begin dismantling 
the culture of death that it has im-
posed on America. 
Mr. Speaker, for decades and right up 
to this very moment, abortion sup-
porters have gone through extraor-
dinary lengths to ignore, to trivialize, 
and to cover up the battered baby vic-
tim. With stolid resolve, they defend 
the indefensible. 
Why does dismembering a child with 
sharp knives, pulverizing a child with 
powerful suction devices, chemically 
poisoning a baby with any number of 
toxic 
chemicals—one 
method 
euphemistically called medical abor-
tion—why does all of this fail to elicit 
so much as a scintilla of empathy, 
mercy, or compassion from the so- 
called pro-choice crowd? 
Have the physical and emotional con-
sequences 
of 
women 
been 
under-
reported? You bet they have. I have 
been in the pro-life movement for al-
most 50 years. Both my wife, Marie, 
and I do work with a lot of women who 
have had abortions. They tell us stories 
of agony that, just like the fact of the 
unborn child’s worth and dignity, has 
been trivialized by the other side of 
this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, why are children born 
alive during some late-term abortions 
not given the same standard of care 
and respect as premature infants born 
at that very same age? They are left to 
die, or they are just killed after they 
are born. 
President 
Biden 
understands 
the 
gruesome reality of abortion and this 
injustice. At least he once did. As Sen-
ator Biden wrote to constituents in ex-
plaining his support for the Hyde 
amendment, for example, prohibiting 
taxpayer funding for elective abor-
tions, he said it would protect both the 
woman and her unborn child. He stated 
at the time he had consistently, on no 
fewer than 50 occasions, voted against 
Federal funding of abortions. Further, 
those of us who are opposed to abortion 
should not be compelled to pay for 
them. 
Today, the President has weaponized 
the entire Federal bureaucracy to ag-
gressively promote abortion on demand 
at home and overseas, including full 
court press to force taxpayers to fund 
abortions on demand including the re-
peal of the Hyde amendment. 
Last September, the House passed a 
bill, the abortion on demand until 
birth act. Of course, it had a different 
name that just cloaked the misery that 
it would impose. That bill would not 
only codify late-term abortions, it 
would also nullify nearly every modest 
pro-life restriction ever enacted by the 
States including a woman’s right to 
know laws in 35 states, parental in-
volvement statutes in 37 states, pain- 
capable unborn child protection laws in 
19 states, sex-election abortion bans in 
almost a dozen states and waiting peri-
ods in 26 states. By his words and his 
deeds, the President has become the 
abortion President. I think he wants to 
own that. 
Mr. Speaker, this all comes at a time 
when ultrasound imaging has made un-
born babies more visible, with a great-
er clarity than ever before. Break-
through research has now found that 
unborn children can feel pain at a ges-
tational age of 15 weeks and maybe 
earlier. 
b 1345 
Today modern medicine treats an 
ever-increasing number of unborn chil-
dren with disability and disease as pa-
tients in need of diagnosis and life-en-
hancing treatments before birth. Un-
born babies are society’s youngest pa-
tients and deserve protection, not 
death by abortion. Science informs us 
that birth is merely an event—albeit a 
very important one—in the life of the 
child. It is not the beginning of his or 
her life. 
As most people know, after the 
ultrasound the grandparents, the par-
ents, and the friends get pictures of the 
child in utero. The ultrasound pictures 
are the first baby pictures that are now 
plastered on all of our refrigerators in 
great expectation for that event called 
birth. 
The right to life is the first human 
right, and it must be guaranteed to ev-
eryone regardless of race, age, sex, dis-
ability, stage of development, or condi-
tion of dependency. Life is not just for 
the planned, the privileged, or the per-
fect. 
We need to protect these innocent 
children. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
LET’S HAVE A DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
commend my colleagues who have been 
down here on the floor of the House of 
Representatives for the most part of 
the last hour talking about the impor-
tance of defending life, those infa-
mous—or famous or important words, I 
should say, in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence: life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness. 
Nothing can be more important than 
this body focusing on defending life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; 
and my colleagues’ focus on life, as we 
sit here now 49 years removed from a 
Supreme Court decision taking out of 
the hands of the people and putting it 
into the hands of unelected judges’ de-
cisions, about the beginning of life, 
when life begins, the important reality 
of a people defending life. 
What is controversial about defend-
ing life? 
It is a question for this body.

January 20, 2022 
What is controversial about defend-
ing life when we talk about life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness and 
when we talk about living on this 
Earth while God gives us the precious 
time we have here? 
What are we going to do with that 
time? 
Are we going to live free? 
Are we going to be able to pursue 
happiness? 
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness: one might wonder here now 1 
year into the current administration, 
the Biden administration, whether the 
average American would say that he or 
she is free to pursue happiness. 
Are we free? 
Are we free to pursue happiness 
when, in fact, just a few miles away— 
and, frankly, a few thousand feet—from 
this Chamber where we are right now, 
restaurants are being chastised and 
pursued by the Government of the Dis-
trict of Columbia representing this 
area that forms our Nation’s Capitol 
because those restaurants may not be-
lieve that it is in their interest or the 
interest of the people whom they serve 
to be checking papers and to be check-
ing so-called vaccine passports or vac-
cine passes? 
One restaurant in particular over on 
H Street—which was one of the early 
restaurants on H Street as it was revi-
talizing—has been fined, berated, and 
harassed by the Government of the Dis-
trict of Columbia for wanting its doors 
to be open and not wanting to harass 
its patrons. They want them to use 
their own free will to make a decision 
about what is in their interest. They 
don’t want to live in a republic where 
you are forced to show papers to walk 
about and to engage in society, to free-
ly move about and engage in com-
merce. 
The very heart of the kinds of ideas 
that the Founders meant and what Jef-
ferson meant when he penned pursuit 
of happiness is that we not allow a gov-
ernment through tyrannical policies to 
interfere with our pursuit of happiness: 
our ability to go have a business, our 
ability to go out and take care of our 
family, our ability to move about and 
to engage in commerce, our ability to 
create wealth and opportunity for our 
children and our grandchildren, to be 
able to get healthcare, and to be able 
to be secure in our possessions, secure 
in our belongings, and secure in our 
own homes. 
I would ask this question: Is the 
United States more secure than it was 
1 year ago? 
Is the United States stronger eco-
nomically than it was 1 year ago? 
Is the United States stronger on the 
world stage? 
Are we safer from our enemies than 
we were 1 year ago? 
Is our border secure? 
Are we able to afford energy and have 
reliable energy to heat our homes, fuel 
our cars, provide jobs, and keep us 
warm in the winter and cool in the 
summer? 
Are we able to do that better more 
than 1 year ago? 
The answer very clearly to all of 
those questions is a resounding ‘‘no.’’ 
Do you think it is an accident that I 
just spent 2 hours in a hearing in the 
Judiciary Committee bemoaning the 
United States Senate for holding the 
line on the filibuster which Democrats 
and this President wanted to throw 
over the wall in the name of voting 
rights 
because 
nobody 
can 
oppose 
something called voting rights? 
They put up those words, they call it 
the Voting Rights Act, and they name 
it after people we serve with in the 
Chamber to provide maximum guilt if 
you dare stand up and say, Mr. Speak-
er, that the people in the States ought 
to be able to decide how to ensure that 
the elections of the people who rep-
resent them are secure; that you dare 
to have a voter ID favored by 80 per-
cent of the American people. 
But yet let’s go back to what I just 
said: I have to have an ID just to walk 
in and buy a hamburger in the Nation’s 
Capitol, but I cannot have an ID to 
vote. No. No. No. That is Jim Crow 2.0 
I am told by my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle. 
I actually had colleagues on the com-
mittee today walking through the hor-
rors of the poll tax—the jelly bean 
counting and all of the obstructions 
put into place for voting in the 1950s 
and 1960s that the Voting Rights Act 
nobly pursued to correct—and then 
tried to compare that to voter identi-
fication. 
They tried to compare that to want-
ing to make sure that mail-in ballots 
aren’t abused by anybody in any party, 
even though, by the way, those bas-
tions of crazy conservatism, Jimmy 
Carter and James Baker, came out in a 
report over a decade ago that The New 
York Times quoted saying precisely 
that mail-in ballots are the area where 
you have the most fraud. 
Now, all of us want to have integrity 
and belief in our elections. But our 
Democratic colleagues want to use 
that issue to divide us, as President 
Biden literally admitted yesterday. In 
his 1-hour marathon wandering, mean-
dering press conference, he literally 
said that he could not say whether the 
elections will be legitimate this fall 
unless—unless—we embrace the legis-
lation that he says must get passed and 
that we must set aside the traditions of 
the Senate to jam it through. And all 
of it, very clearly, is to set the stage 
for a lack of faith and belief in the 
elections that are coming this Novem-
ber. 
Again I ask: Is America stronger or 
weaker? 
Is it richer or poorer? More secure or 
less safe? 
We know the answer, and that is why 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle wish not to talk about those 
issues. We don’t want to have a debate 
about crime on the floor. 
Do any of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle want to come down to 
the floor right now and have a debate 
about crime in the United States? 
Do they? 
Do you think a 50 percent increase in 
crime in Austin, a 50 percent increase 
in crime in San Antonio, a 19-year-old 
woman shot in a Burger King in New 
York City, a 24-year-old student mur-
dered walking the streets of Los Ange-
les, train robberies in 21st century 
America with litter all over the tracks 
in Los Angeles, is an accident? 
Or could it be that radical leftists 
who are funded to take over the dis-
trict attorneys’ offices in cities across 
America and radical city councils like 
the Austin City Council and leftists in 
this 
Chamber 
believe 
that 
letting 
criminals out on the streets and be-
lieve in not prosecuting people is going 
to make our country safer? 
It is empirically and obviously un-
true. 
The American people see it. And I 
promise you, Mr. Speaker, take this 
bet: We will not have a debate on the 
floor of this body about crime while I 
am here this year. It will not happen. 
My Democratic colleagues would not 
dare have a debate about crime because 
they would get absolutely decimated. 
They sure as heck do not want to 
have a debate about the border. 
Do you want to talk about 2 million 
apprehensions? 
Do you want to talk about 1 million 
people released? 
Do you want to talk about dead Tex-
ans? 
Do you want to talk about fentanyl 
pouring into our communities, 100,000 
dead Americans, opioid poisonings of 
our youth, and kids taking Xanax and 
dying because cartels are flooding into 
our country while China drives them 
right up through Mexico? 
Not a person in this Chamber on the 
other side of the aisle wants to come to 
the floor and have an adult debate 
about why our country is much less se-
cure and much more endangered at the 
hands of the cartels and of people mak-
ing money trafficking in human beings 
and undermining our security and safe-
ty in the United States of America. 
I promise you, Mr. Speaker, Joe 
Biden and the NANCY PELOSI Democrats 
have no interest in having a debate 
about the border because it is an em-
barrassment and it is a travesty. 
Ranches are getting overrun, people 
are dying, bullets are being fired across 
at our own Border Patrol, the National 
Guard is having to fire at cars coming 
across the border, livestock is getting 
out, bodies are stacking up in body 
trailers in Brooks County, Texas, and 
cartels are making hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars on a daily basis driving 
fentanyl into our kids’ communities 
and schools. 
No, no, no. We do not want to have a 
debate about the state of our border. 
Do we want to have a debate about 
the state of healthcare mandates? 
No. No. This body has no debate but 
embraces rules. We must wear masks, 
they say. For a year and a half we have

been excoriated—even fined—if you 
don’t wear a mask the floor of the 
House 
of 
Representatives—masks 
which are very clearly proven—fabric 
masks—to have no real discernible ben-
efit over the last year and a half of the 
mandates that say you must wear a 
face covering. 
They said: Well, are we going to man-
date N95s? 
Are we going to have to wear N95s on 
the floor? 
Do they want to talk about the nega-
tive effects in the study that wearing 
N95s for a prolonged period of time, 
what that does for people’s health and 
well-being, breathing carbon dioxide, 
minimizing your cognitive ability if 
you wear N95s for a long time? 
Some people might joke: Would it 
make any difference on the floor of the 
House if you minimized the cognitive 
ability of the Members of the House? 
You could argue that it may not make 
any difference whatsoever. I am look-
ing in the mirror myself. 
We do not want to have a debate on 
the floor of the House on anything, by 
the way, much less the reality of what 
has been happening with respect to this 
virus and our response to it; and what 
Anthony Fauci engaged in with respect 
to the reality of the truth of funding 
gain-of-function research knowing full 
well the dangers, working to cover that 
up and hide from the American people 
how this virus came about; not want-
ing to pursue the truth on that, not 
wanting to pursue the truth or conduct 
studies on natural immunity. 
We have study after study after study 
coming out right now. I could pull out 
on my phone and pull up study after 
study now finally demonstrating and 
showing how natural immunity is more 
powerful than vaccinations, and people 
don’t want to be able to have that hon-
est conversation. 
b 1400 
An adult leadership would have done 
like the Nation of Japan saying: We be-
lieve that vaccines are effective for a 
large group of people. We believe that 
there are some risks. You are adults. 
We won’t mandate. You decide. 
We can’t do that in the supposed land 
of the free? We sit up here and we stare 
at that American flag and we talk 
about the Senate being the greatest de-
liberative body. They don’t really de-
bate. This being the people’s House, the 
people’s Chamber, when was the last 
time the Speaker heard a robust debate 
on the floor of the House with multiple 
Members? 
When was the last time we offered an 
amendment on the floor of the House 
in open debate that wasn’t predeter-
mined by all of the Rules Committee 
overlords who govern our lives? Demo-
crat and Republican, I do want to say. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 years since 
we have had an amendment offered on 
the floor of the House in open debate. 
Do you want to know why we can’t do 
anything in this Chamber? Because we 
don’t ever debate. We don’t ever actu-
ally have a discussion, throw things 
out there and then vote. Maybe, just 
maybe, we come to some bipartisan 
agreement. 
I am happy to work with my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
DEAN PHILLIPS and I worked on the 
PPP 
Flexibility 
Act. 
ABIGAIL 
SPANBERGER and I have introduced leg-
islation called the TRUST Act to deal 
with 
stock 
trading 
believing 
that 
might help improve people’s faith and 
confidence in this body. I have intro-
duced numerous bills and passed nu-
merous bills with my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle. That is not what 
this is about. 
It is about a broken body refusing to 
actually debate, refusing to actually 
engage, refusing to offer amendments. 
Both sides do it. That needs to end. 
The last point that I will make on 
that point, if you want this body to 
function again, you have to stop spend-
ing money we don’t have. If you keep 
writing blank checks, how on Earth is 
there a check against the wisdom of 
the policy? You just keep writing a 
check to keep doing the same thing or 
to do something different. You can’t 
run a business that way. You can’t run 
a home that way. You can’t run a 
church that way. You can’t run a le-
gitimate school that way. But no, no, 
we just keep writing checks to fund the 
expansion of government, to fund the 
creation of programs no matter who is 
in power. 
Over the last year, we have seen what 
that causes when it is then left in the 
hands of an administration that lit-
erally does not care about the rule of 
law. 
To be very clear, this administration 
is ignoring the rule of law, ignoring 
their oath, ignoring their duty to en-
force the laws of the United States, ig-
noring their duty to secure the border, 
ignoring their duty to stand up in de-
fense of the men and women in blue, to 
follow the laws around the United 
States, ignoring their oath to stand up 
and defend the United States against 
our foreign enemies; hold the line 
against Russia; push back on Russia; 
sanction them; hold the line on Nord 
Stream 2; stand alongside Ukraine; 
push back on China; stop appeasing 
them. 
Don’t leave $85 billion sitting there 
in the hands of terrorists when we walk 
away and abandon our duty and leave 
those men and women in the field, and 
then have 13 dead marines to show for 
it. 
That is the legacy of the first year of 
this administration. But will President 
Biden, when he strolls to that podium 
on March 1 for his so-called State of 
the Union, and we are all spread out, 
and all wearing masks, and doing what-
ever the heck we are going to do—not 
actually doing the people’s business— 
will he address any of those issues? 
Will he talk about border security? 
Will he talk about how we are weaker 
around the world? Will he talk about 
the crime on the streets of Los Ange-
les, New York, Austin, San Antonio, 
and Chicago? 
Will he talk about the businesses get-
ting crippled by mask mandates and 
health mandates? 
Will he talk about the children who 
are now having mental health issues, 
the people who are sick; the diseases 
that weren’t dealt with, all to push a 
vaccine mandate that goes contrary to 
the pursuit of happiness and our right 
as Americans to live free? 
Will he talk about any of those 
things? Will he talk about the fact that 
the United States of America is sitting 
on one of the world’s largest reservoirs 
of energy and, yet, we are wondering 
even in Texas whether you can have 
the lights on because we built no nu-
clear power plants. 
We slowed down our production of 
clean burning natural gas, all chasing 
unicorn energy policies of wind and 
solar as if they can possibly, possibly 
power the world at the level that is 
needed for the proper amount of human 
flourishing 
while 
3 
billion 
people 
around this planet do not have access 
to abundant energy and power. 
Will the President of the United 
States come down here and talk about 
that or will he get up there and just 
talk about: Well, we are going to be net 
zero in our carbon production by 2035, 
or 2050, or make up some totally arbi-
trary number without regard at all to 
what that does to the price of energy 
and the availability and abundance of 
energy. 
All of this has real-life consequences 
for Americans. People die. Houses get 
cold. People can’t get access to energy. 
They can’t afford energy. They lose 
jobs. You have stagnation and then you 
have the brilliance of this administra-
tion and the brilliance of those in the 
media starting to talk about energy 
and food price control because, of 
course, that is what my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle will resort 
to. 
They will sit there and bemoan mar-
kets when they don’t let the markets 
work. Healthcare markets never work. 
We haven’t had a healthcare market in 
decades. It is an absolute lie; and I am 
looking at you Big Healthcare. I am 
looking at you Big Pharma. I am look-
ing at you hospitals. I am looking at 
you Big Insurance. You made out like 
bandits after ObamaCare. You minted 
money. And probably three-quarters of 
the people in this Chamber fattened 
their wallets and their portfolios riding 
the back of all of that Big Healthcare 
enrichment, all at the expense of poor 
Americans around this country trying 
to get access to a doctor without hav-
ing to call some bureaucrat in the gov-
ernment, the VA, or an insurance com-
pany, or however it may be, but it sure 
as heck isn’t their doctor. 
We don’t have health freedom in this 
country. 
We 
have 
mandated 
Big 
Healthcare, Big Government, Big In-
surance, bureaucracy. And everybody 
knows it. Everybody knows it because 
you all had to deal with it. You have

had to call somebody. You had to call 
some kid sitting in Omaha in some 
phone bank telling you which doctor 
you can go to 2,000 miles away. That is 
the truth, and we all know it. We sit in 
here, we roll in here and we say: Let’s 
spend more money and create a govern-
ment 
program. 
Let’s 
spend 
more 
money we don’t have. 
Not one person in this body will come 
down here and truly debate any of 
these truths when you are $30 trillion 
in debt; when you are funding the very 
FBI going after parents for daring to 
stand up and defend their children in a 
school board meeting; when you are 
funding the Department of Homeland 
Security that is literally lying to the 
American people saying our border is 
secure while hundreds of thousands of 
people come across. 
You want to know what happened in 
that synagogue? Because we don’t have 
a dang clue who is coming to the 
United States, and this administration 
doesn’t care. They don’t care. They 
don’t care what list they are on. They 
don’t care whether they pose a danger 
to the United States of America. They 
don’t care at all who is coming into 
this country. And they sure as heck 
don’t care what is happening to the 
people of Texas, Arizona, or, frankly, 
everybody around this country who is 
having to bear the cost, who is having 
to bear the burden of what wide-open 
borders means to the United States of 
America. 
Complain 
about 
Mayorkas? 
We 
should impeach him for failing to 
faithfully execute the laws of the 
United States of America, endangering 
Americans in the process, ignoring the 
laws of the United States. And that is 
what is happening. That is what is hap-
pening. 
America is poorer, sicker, and less 
safe a year into the Biden administra-
tion, and that is the truth. Our enemies 
know it. That is why Russia is going 
after Ukraine. That is why China is 
rattling on a daily basis. That is why 
Russia, China, and Iran are talking 
about joint exercises. That is why the 
cartels are emboldened. That is why 
there are people marching through 
Mexico from all over the world coming 
to our southern border. That is why 
there are people on the streets break-
ing into businesses, assaulting people 
on the streets and killing them, raping 
them. It is happening every single day 
in the United States of America with 
reckless abandon while Democrats in 
district attorney’s offices, Democrats 
in the House of Representatives, Demo-
crats in this administration do nothing 
about it and do not care that the Amer-
ican people are left holding the bag. 
Then they want to talk about taking 
away our Second Amendment rights 
and our ability to defend ourselves. 
Well, that crap ain’t going to happen 
because we are going to defend our-
selves in the land of the free. We are 
going to stand up and defend our com-
munities and defend our families. We 
are going to stand up in defense of the 
Constitution and limited government 
and freedom to be able to protect our 
families and protect our States when 
this administration is letting this 
country burn. 
It dares to do an hour-long press con-
ference, lecturing the people for want-
ing to make sure their elections are se-
cure, for daring to say that we should 
have voter identification when that 
same administration is ordering vac-
cine 
mandates 
that 
are 
causing 
healthcare workers to lose their jobs; 
causing healthcare workers in long- 
term health facilities to be unable to 
carry out their jobs. 
And then there is the talk about, oh, 
the burden on hospitals. Well, you just 
caused 20 percent of nurses to have to 
leave because you were mandating they 
take a jab for something that is a year 
old that Pfizer is making billions of 
dollars on. Then we won’t even have a 
hearing about why on Earth we are 
having this virus in the first place, be-
cause of what Anthony Fauci knew and 
what NIH was up to and what China 
was up to. 
We won’t have a hearing about nat-
ural immunity. We won’t have a hear-
ing about the dangers and levels of 
dangers of the vaccines, what they may 
be. Again, my polio-stricken father 
who is 79 has been vaccinated. I refuse 
to say whether I have been vaccinated. 
I think it is a principle for Americans 
that they shouldn’t have to say. 
My point is, there are people for 
whom the vaccine makes sense. There 
are people for whom the vaccine does 
not make sense. Mandating a jab in a 5- 
year-old is irresponsible and it is dan-
gerous. We should have that conversa-
tion instead of blindly walking around 
preaching what other people should 
stick in their dang arm. 
But that is what we do in the people’s 
House. I am sitting here in an empty 
Chamber—with the Speaker, respect-
fully—and that is it. They are all jet- 
fumed out, leaving town. Oh, we shut 
down earlier. Let’s get out of here. Or 
they are out at some fundraiser or 
something. 
Let’s have a debate on these issues. 
Let’s seek the truth. I don’t know all of 
the truth on all of those issues. I don’t 
know the specific risks. I have read a 
lot about what is going on with the 
vaccines, positive and negative. But it 
is becoming very, very clear that it 
doesn’t do squat to stop the spread. So 
you are left basically saying: Well, it is 
better for you so that you don’t die in 
the hospital. 
Well, let’s look at the data on that. 
But why don’t we just present the in-
formation and let the American people 
decide? Japan’s vaccine rate is a lot 
higher than ours and ours has man-
dates. All they did was say: We think it 
is good. There are some risks. You de-
cide. We can’t do that in America? 
We can’t just go down to the border 
and say: You know what, it is better 
for migrants, better for Texans and all 
Americans, bad for cartels, bad for 
China, if we secure our border. That is 
the truth. Talk to the migrants getting 
abused. Talk to the people in south 
Texas. Go to Laredo and Webb County. 
Sit down with the Brown people in La-
redo who will say: We are pretty ticked 
off with this administration about how 
they are handling the border. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle might be up for a rude awak-
ening pretty soon about their expecta-
tions of what voters are voting for 
them and what voters are not because 
there are a lot of people in this country 
that are sick and tired of the elite in 
this town, immersed in the swamp, pro-
moting Big Healthcare, promoting Big 
Tech, 
promoting 
Big 
Government, 
minimizing the rights and the abilities 
of Americans to live their lives the way 
they see fit. 
That is our calling as we head to 2026, 
our 250th birthday of the United States 
of America, which comes up in 4-and-a- 
half years. Will we be able to say that 
we live in the land of the free? Will we 
be able to say that we are pursuing 
happiness; that we are the country of 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness? 
We will only be able to do that if we 
stand up and secure our Nation’s sov-
ereignty, defend our streets, protect 
our families, stand up to enemies 
around the world, and limit this body 
to the job that it was given in the Con-
stitution: limit our spending to the 
dollars that we have and responsibly 
lead this country and represent the 
people so that this country can, in fact, 
be great in our agreements and our dis-
agreements in a Federalist Republic 
where we are able to live free. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
night was a reminder of a difficult but 
important reality of our great democ-
racy: The march to freedom, through 
thick and thin, is never over—and we 
have to keep marching. 
While last night’s vote was dis-
appointing, it will not deter Senate 
Democrats from continuing our fight 
against voter suppression, dark money, 
and partisan gerrymandering. Demo-
crats are proud of the fight we held last 
night. The strength, eloquence, enthu-
siasm, and overwhelming participation 
of my Democratic colleagues during 
debate was exhilarating and shows the 
passion we feel about this issue. 
Facing an uphill battle from the 
start, we lost the vote. But to have not 
voted would have been a far greater 
loss, a loss for our Democratic Party, 
which for generations has stood for 
voting rights; a loss for the civil rights 
advocates who have sacrificed so much 
on this issue; and a loss for the Amer-
ican people and what this country 
stands for. On an issue this important, 
not doing everything we could would 
have been unacceptable. 
Now, the bromides of the beltway 
class hold we should not have held a 
vote on voting rights if the outcome 
was not certain. They are wrong. Imag-
ine telling Dr. King not to march from 
Selma to Montgomery because he 
could not be sure what obstacles await-
ed him and his fellow freedom fighters. 
Imagine telling John Lewis he should 
never have crossed the Pettus Bridge 
because it was unclear what perils 
awaited him on the other side. 
Every Member of this body who has 
ever invoked these great titans of free-
dom has an obligation—an obligation— 
to uphold their legacies not just with 
words but with actions. Senators were 
elected to vote. The examples of Dr. 
King, of John Lewis inspire us, give us 
strength, and show us that sometimes 
the only right option is to move for-
ward. 
And we need to remember what this 
is about. With the advent of Donald 
Trump and his many Big Lies, with the 
January 6 insurrection, with the vi-
cious 
acts 
of 
voter 
suppression 
throughout the States, and with the 
greedy dark money interests that fuel 
the Republican Party these days, this 
is a fight for the soul of America— 
nothing less. So Democrats will not 
shy away from an uphill fight; we will 
continue to face them. 
And I believe that the lessons of his-
tory are clear: When Representatives 
have to take a stand, when they have 
to show to the American people where 
they are on the issues, the right side of 
history ultimately prevails. We know 
history is on the side of voting rights, 
and we know that forcing leaders to 
take stands will ultimately move the 
ball forward. 
Now, finally, I want to thank all my 
colleagues who came to the floor yes-
terday to speak valiantly in defense of 
voting rights and for working assidu-
ously for months on this vital issue: 
Senators KLOBUCHAR
and MERKLEY, 
BOOKER, SCHATZ, Senator KAINE—you, 
Mr. President—Senators KING, TESTER, 
WARNOCK, OSSOFF, DURBIN, PADILLA, 
LEAHY—and so many, so many more. 
Their leadership, their expertise, and 
their dedication to protecting our de-
mocracy is inspiring. It gives our cau-
cus strength, and it made such a dif-
ference. Last night was unusual and ex-
hilarating because we fought the good 
fight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S358 
January 20, 2022 
As former Majority Leader Alben 
Barkley of Kentucky said 80 years ago 
this November, facing a filibuster, 
which successfully blocked anti-poll 
tax legislation—the majority leader, 
Alben Barkley, from Kentucky, said: 
I am glad I have made this fight. I have 
made it in behalf of what I believe to be the 
broad and true foundations of a true democ-
racy. 
Senate Democrats fighting for voting 
rights is not over. We will keep fight-
ing until voting rights are protected 
for every single American. And one 
day—hopefully, 
sooner 
rather 
than 
later—we will succeed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, to-
morrow, our Nation’s Capital will once 
again host many thousands of Ameri-
cans gathering peacefully to support 
the most basic human right—the right 
to life. For 49 years, the March for Life 
has united people from diverse back-
grounds, different faiths, and all 50 
States to celebrate the dignity of 
human life and confront the ways our 
society fails to protect it. 
This year, the marchers will arrive in 
a Washington controlled by a Demo-
cratic Party that has grown increas-
ingly radical on this issue. Today’s 
Democrats work overtime to keep our 
country one of just seven nations on 
the planet that have abortion on de-
mand even after the unborn children 
can feel pain. Our shameful company 
includes China and North Korea. Fewer 
than 30 percent of Americans endorse 
this view, but Democrats have made it 
party dogma. 
On President Biden’s watch, Wash-
ington Democrats have even turned 
against the longstanding bipartisan 
Hyde Amendment. Both parties used to 
agree that at least Federal taxpayers 
should not be forced to fund abortions. 
Now Democrats on both sides of Penn-
sylvania Avenue declared war on even 
this. 
So I warmly welcome the marchers 
from Kentucky and across the country. 
This radical version of the Democratic 
Party needs to hear your voices now 
more than ever. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Today marks ex-
actly 1 year since President Biden be-
came our fourty-sixth President. This 
all-Democratic government has had 365 
days to start delivering on some of 
their core promises. 
So what were those promises, in their 
own words? ‘‘Crushing the virus,’’ 
‘‘strengthen[ing] our alliances,’’ and, 
above all else, ‘‘lower[ing] the tempera-
ture’’ and reuniting a divided country. 
Remember, upon taking office, this 
administration had historic tailwinds 
at its back. President Biden inherited 
lifesaving vaccines and a distribution 
system that was already up and run-
ning. He inherited a string of bipar-
tisan rescue packages, including one 
that was only just a few days old. He 
inherited an economy that was prime 
for a roaring comeback. Those were the 
promises. That was the inheritance. 
So let’s take a look at the progress 
report. Last spring, against expert ad-
vice, the Biden administration dumped 
another mountain of borrowed cash on 
an already white-hot economy. As a re-
sult, we are now being hammered by 
the worst inflation in 40 years. Prac-
tically everything families need and 
want have gotten much, much more ex-
pensive. Constant shortages disrupt 
family shopping. Households are being 
hit with soaring heating costs if they 
stay home and soaring gas prices if 
they go out. Our economic trajectory 
looks shakier today than it did when 
Democrats were sworn in. 
Of course, we have continued adding 
back jobs from COVID lockdowns. That 
was certainly going to happen. But job 
creation has massively underperformed 
Democrats’ own projections for job cre-
ation with their super costly spring-
time stimulus package. 
When 2021 was said and done, the 
country had added roughly the same 
number of jobs that we were on track 
to create before Democrats imple-
mented one policy or spent one dime. 
They managed to literally blow $1.9 
trillion but only barely beat the start-
ing trajectory they inherited. 
They call that spending a COVID 
package, but less than 10 percent of the 
money went to the actual medical 
fight, and that certainly shows. 
Americans are entering their third 
year of this pandemic with too few 
tests, too few treatments, too many 
new cases, and too many school clo-
sures; muddled guidance on boosters 
that caused FDA experts to resign in 
protest, and needless divisive vaccine 
mandates that were not even constitu-
tional. 
One year in, the coronavirus is decid-
edly uncrushed. 
And COVID wasn’t the only epidemic 
sweeping American streets. Take vio-
lent crime. Far-left rhetoric and anti- 
law-enforcement local policies have led 
major cities to set all-time records for 
homicide in 2021. 
Or take fentanyl. This deadly im-
ported poison was the leading cause of 
death for Americans aged 18 to 45, last 
year. The No. 1 killer of Americans in 
their prime—fentanyl. 
So why aren’t Democrats treating 
this like an emergency? When was the 
last time President Biden even talked 
about this? 
And drug deaths are not the only 
consequence of our weak borders. 
Candidate 
Biden’s 
rhetoric 
incentivized a historic flood of illegal 
immigration, 
and 
then 
President 
Biden’s weak policies lit the fuse. The 
result? The biggest surge in illegal bor-
der crossings in 60 years—60 years. 
All these issues are priorities for 
American families, but the Biden ad-
ministration spent most of 2021 focused 
on none of those. Washington Demo-
crats spent months chasing a reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree packed with 
far-left policies that citizens never 
wanted. We spent half of 2021 trying 
and failing to blow $5 trillion on wind-
mills and welfare. 
When that effort faded, Democrats 
abruptly pivoted and started shouting 
that 
American 
democracy 
was 
on 
death’s door. They propagandized that 
some evil anti-voting conspiracy was 
sweeping America, and the only solu-
tion to this grand crisis was a gigantic 
partisan election takeover bill that 
Democrats had conveniently written 
years before the events which they say 
now prompted it. 
The American people didn’t buy the 
fake hysteria. One-half of one percent 
of the country thinks election laws are 
our top issue. In fact, more Americans 
believe voting laws are too loose than 
too tight. 
Oh, but Democrats went all in on this 
obsession. A few days ago, the sitting 
President of the United States called 
millions of Americans his domestic en-
emies 
and 
analogized—analogized— 
U.S. Senators to Jefferson Davis. 
Well, last night, the fake panic drove 
48 Senate Democrats to walk the plank 
on a failed effort to shatter the Senate 
itself for short-term power. And now 
Washington Democrats appear to be 
launching an absurd and reckless cam-
paign to delegitimize the next election 
in advance, in case they lose it. Sound 
familiar? 
Yesterday, the President told report-
ers that he might not accept the 2022 
election results as legitimate if his 
election takeover bills do not pass Con-
gress first. It all sounds eerily familiar. 
This morning, the House majority 
whip followed suit. He was asked if the 
legitimacy of our elections is contin-
gent on Washington Democrats passing 
these bills, and he replied: ‘‘I am abso-
lutely concerned about that.’’ 
The Democrats who preached count-
less sermons about accepting voter de-
cisions are now saying the midterms 
may be illegitimate, unless they win. 
So America, after all of this, do you 
feel unified? Do you feel healed? Do 
you feel like our core institutions are 
being protected? 
Now, Senate Republicans have met 
this administration more than half-
way. In 2021, the Senate built and 
passed a major infrastructure bill. We 
passed bipartisan legislation on com-
peting with China. 
But beyond that, this administration 
deliberately chose to build their whole

governing strategy around the party- 
line reconciliation process. 
So 
the 
President 
cannot 
deflect 
blame for his disappointing first year. 
The American people know where the 
buck stops, and if our Democratic 
friends do not change course, before 
long, the buck will stop somewhere 
else. 
Now, on a related matter, President 
Biden also campaigned on strength-
ening America’s partnerships and re-
newing our global leadership. Well, how 
has the administration done? 
The administration that campaigned 
on restoring alliances abandoned a coa-
lition of loyal partners with its disas-
trous and fatal retreat from Afghani-
stan. 
The Biden administration green-lit 
Vladimir Putin’s Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line, and the Democrats blocked us 
from sanctioning it. This pipeline will 
help Putin gain even more leverage 
over Western Europe and, of course, 
further isolate Ukraine. 
As we speak—right now—Putin has 
amassed more than 100,000 Russian 
troops along the border of Ukraine. If 
these forces cross into Ukraine, it will 
not be a new invasion or a ‘‘re-inva-
sion.’’ It will represent a major esca-
lation of an ongoing occupation. 
Ukraine has been fighting a Russian- 
backed war on its own now for 8 years. 
Eight years ago, I tried to warn Presi-
dent Obama that Putin is only deterred 
when the world imposes real costs— 
real costs—on his misbehavior. 
But the Biden Administration sent 
Ukraine nonlethal support, and the 
sanctions it imposed and coordinated 
proved not to be as tough as adver-
tised. The Obama-Biden administration 
failed to end Putin’s invasion or com-
pel compliance with the Minsk accords. 
Now the Biden-Harris team must not 
repeat the Obama-Biden grave mis-
takes. 
But yesterday, on live television, 
President 
Biden 
telegraphed 
pas-
sivity—telegraphed 
passivity—and 
weakness, exactly when our allies can 
least afford it. Our President seemed to 
state—and, I pray, unintentionally— 
that he expects Putin to escalate in 
Ukraine, and, in any case, Putin can do 
what he wants. 
Here is what the President said: 
‘‘That decision is totally, solely, com-
pletely a Putin decision. . . . I suspect 
it matters which side of the bed he gets 
up on.’’ 
What on Earth does that mean? 
Further, the President said: ‘‘My 
guess is he will move in.’’ 
The President said: ‘‘My guess is he 
will move in. He has to do something.’’ 
So President Biden thinks Putin has 
to do something. What does that even 
mean? Why is our President specu-
lating like a passive observer on the 
sidelines? 
He isn’t a pundit. He isn’t Putin’s 
psychoanalyst. He is the President of 
the United States. 
So will America hold Russia account-
able if it escalates? Here was the mes-
sage from our Commander in Chief: ‘‘It 
depends on what Russia does. It’s one 
thing if it’s a minor incursion’’—a 
minor incursion—‘‘and then we end up 
having to fight about what to do and 
not do, et cetera.’’ 
‘‘It is one thing if it is a minor incur-
sion’’? Does this mean President Biden 
will not actually authorize the tough 
response that his own administration 
officials have spent weeks—weeks— 
promising? 
This was a moment to deliver a pow-
erful warning to the Kremlin that 
Ukraine’s sovereignty is inviolable; 
that we would stand with her people; 
that the cost of escalation would be 
devastating. 
It was a moment to reassure our 
partners in Kiev and our allies along 
NATO’s eastern flank that America 
had their back. 
It was a moment to call for NATO’s 
unity, not to expose and appear ham-
strung by NATO’s divisions. It was a 
bizarre and devastating performance— 
especially, I would add—for our friends 
on the frontlines. 
President Zelensky’s Defense Min-
ister has already shot back. This is 
from Ukraine’s Defense Minister: 
We should not give Putin the slightest 
chance to play with quasi-aggression or 
small incursion operations. This aggression 
was [already] there since 2014. This is the 
fact. 
I suspect our own Secretary of State, 
who is in Europe to meet with our al-
lies and the Russian Foreign Minister— 
was also shocked by what the Presi-
dent had said. Minutes later, White 
House staff put out a frantic statement 
laying out a completely different posi-
tion than what President Biden had 
just expressed. By then, of course, sig-
nificant damage had been done. 
But, alas, the damage can be undone. 
The President of the United States is 
never powerless. President Biden needs 
to clean up his remarks. He needs to 
clearly state American resolve and 
clearly demonstrate American leader-
ship. He should call President Zelensky 
and NATO’s allies most threatened by 
Russian aggression. He should rally al-
lies and partners around the world to 
defend Ukraine and the international 
system that is being threatened by 
Putin. 
His administration should be using 
every waking moment right now—right 
now—to expedite our delivery of real 
defensive capabilities to Ukraine. 
The President must cut the indeci-
sion and redtape that has slowed us and 
our partners down. President Biden 
should finally, at long last, get around 
to 
nominating 
an 
Ambassador 
to 
Ukraine, a position he has left empty 
for 12 crucial months. 
He should send U.S. forces to shore 
up NATO’s eastern flank—not if—not if 
and when Putin escalates, but right 
now, before it is too late. 
He should encourage our treaty allies 
to do likewise. But while alliance unity 
is important, the lowest common de-
nominator of NATO’s most nervous 
members cannot be allowed to restrict 
American action. 
Whatever 
course 
other 
nations 
choose to chart, we cannot afford to let 
Moscow underestimate our resolve to 
impose 
serious—serious—crushing 
costs in response to any further incur-
sion against Ukraine. 
Our friends and America’s reputation 
deserve nothing less.

f 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, tomor-
row, the streets of our Nation’s Capital 
will be filled with Americans from 
across the country who have come to 
Washington, DC, to march for life. 
They come to nudge the conscience of 
our Nation, to remind all of us that 
every day in this country, baby girls 
and boys are being killed by abortion. 
The March for Life, of course, is just 
one small facet of the pro-life move-
ment, which works every day in this 
country to offer help and hope to moms 
in need. Pro-lifers collect supplies for 
pregnant moms. They pay for prenatal 
care. They assist moms with housing. 
They help moms continue with their 
schooling or find employment. They 
provide a listening ear to support a 
mom going through a difficult time. 
The March for Life is just one small 
facet of that work, but it is an impor-
tant one because abortion is an injus-
tice that happens behind closed doors. 
It is not something that we see hap-
pening, and so it is all too easy to for-
get that every day in this country, 
hundreds of babies are being killed by 
abortion. 
The CDC reports that almost 630,000 
babies were killed by abortion in 2019 
alone—630,000. That number is so big, it 
is almost unfathomable. To put 630,000 
in some kind of perspective, that is 
equivalent to roughly 70 percent of the 
population of my State of South Da-
kota killed in 1 year—630,000 unique, 
unrepeatable human beings; future doc-
tors, nurses, farmers and teachers and 
plumbers and busdrivers and research 
scientists, beloved sisters and brothers 
and nieces and nephews, future moms 
and dads. That is a lot of lives lost. 
So events like the March for Life are 
fundamentally important because they 
provide a public witness to the truth 
about abortion. They remind all of us 
of what can be all too easy to minimize 
or ignore or forget, and that is that in 
this country, we are denying our most 
vulnerable citizens their most basic 
right. 
You would think by now that we 
would have learned our lesson about 
deciding that one group of human 
beings is expendable; about deciding 
that some human beings are excluded 
from the protection and dignity that 
every member of the human family 
should enjoy. Unfortunately, history 
makes clear that great sins are often 
repeated. But we don’t have to stay si-
lent in the face of them. Indeed, we

must not stay silent in the face of 
them. 
‘‘Rescue those being led away to 
death,’’ it says in the Book of Prov-
erbs. ‘‘[H]old back those staggering to-
wards slaughter. If you say, ‘But we 
knew nothing about this,’ does not he 
who weighs the heart perceive it? . . . 
Will he not repay everyone according 
to what they have done?’’ 
The March for Life helps make sure 
that we can never offer the excuse 
‘‘But we knew nothing about this’’ and 
reminds us of our responsibility to 
speak up to rescue the babies in this 
country who are being led away to 
death mere weeks or months after 
their life has begun. 
Those who would defend a supposed 
right to abortion would like Americans 
to believe that the decision that legal-
ized abortion in this country is settled 
law, but the truth is, it is not. If it 
were settled law, the Supreme Court 
wouldn’t regularly be asked to rule on 
abortion legislation. 
There is a reason why Roe v. Wade 
has never taken on the character of 
settled law, and that is because it was 
a fundamentally wrongheaded decision; 
a decision in tension with our most 
basic beliefs as Americans—that every 
person is endowed by our Creator with 
certain 
unalienable 
rights. 
Chief 
among them is the right to life. 
Americans are not a perfect people. 
We have made some very grave errors 
in our past. But Americans are fun-
damentally a good people. While we 
have not always fully realized the 
promise of our Declaration—the prom-
ise of protection for the unalienable 
rights of every person—it is something 
we keep fighting for and pursuing. 
We really believe in the right to life 
and liberty and to the pursuit of happi-
ness, and we have the sentiments to go 
with that: a strong sense of justice, a 
passion for the right, an instinct to 
protect the vulnerable. So the idea of 
killing innocent, vulnerable human 
beings is not something we can easily 
make our peace with. So it is not sur-
prising to me that, despite the best ef-
forts of the pro-abortion movement, a 
strong majority of Americans support 
restrictions on abortion. 
An Associated Press poll from this 
June found that 65 percent of Ameri-
cans believe that abortion should gen-
erally be illegal in the second tri-
mester, or from about 13 weeks of preg-
nancy, while a whopping 80 percent—80 
percent—of Americans believe that 
abortion should generally be illegal in 
the third trimester. 
Americans know that abortions kill 
babies. The pro-abortion movement can 
talk all it wants about blobs of tissue 
or products of conception; science and 
technology and common sense point in-
exorably to the humanity of the un-
born child. And Americans know that 
human beings deserve to be protected 
even when they are small or weak or 
vulnerable—especially when they are 
small or weak or vulnerable. 
It is reprehensible that a country 
like ours, dedicated to the defense of 
human rights, has some of the most ex-
treme abortion laws in the world. We 
are part of just a tiny handful of coun-
tries that allow elective abortion past 
20 weeks of pregnancy. Among those 
other countries are China and North 
Korea—not exactly the kind of com-
pany we want to be keeping when it 
comes to protecting human rights. 
It is time for us to do better. We can 
do better. And I am so grateful for all 
of the marchers and for all those in the 
pro-life movement who are out there 
fighting to ensure that we do better. 
‘‘Speak up for those who cannot 
speak for themselves,’’ it says in the 
Book of Proverbs. Thank you to all 
those who are speaking up tomorrow. 
Keep speaking up, and I am confident 
that sooner or later, life will prevail. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 401 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this 
weekend is the anniversary of the land-
mark Roe v. Wade decision. It is a deci-
sion that, without a doubt, changed 
lives for the better. It prevented a lot 
of harm and helped keep many patients 
healthy. It opened doors for women to 
pursue their career and education goals 
and affirmed the right to control our 
own bodies and our own futures. 
Roe was a giant leap forward, and a 
majority of Americans want to protect 
it. But since Roe was decided, extreme 
Republicans have peddled blatant mis-
information, filled our judicial system 
with anti-abortion judges, and passed 
State laws designed solely to make it 
harder to get abortions—laws that are 
now 
hurting 
people 
of 
color, 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
community, 
immigrants, 
young people, people with low incomes, 
and people with disabilities the most. 
And they are not stopping at abortion. 
They are pushing to make it harder to 
get birth control and defund family 
planning 
clinics—including 
Planned 
Parenthood—which 
provide 
critical 
healthcare for so many communities. 
In Texas, Republicans have passed, 
and the Supreme Court green-lit, a law 
that essentially bans abortions and is 
enforced by pitting neighbor against 
neighbor. And even though medication 
abortion pills are safe to take at home, 
extreme Republicans are now pushing 
to pass laws that not only dictate what 
happens in a doctor’s office but also 
make it harder for patients to take a 
pill in their very own living room. 
You know, Republicans do like to 
talk about Big Government, but over-
riding people’s individual decisions and 
science to dictate what people can do 
in their own homes sounds like a lot of 
overreach. 
The Senator from Oklahoma is here 
with a bill today that has one goal: to 
make it harder to get abortion care by 
allowing someone else’s personal be-
liefs, rather than a patient’s best inter-
est, to determine a patient’s care. And 
that is just one example of the extreme 
agenda Republicans are pushing, today 
and every day. 
I have heard from so many people 
about the problems and the harm this 
has caused in their lives. I have heard 
from many patients who had to jump 
through unnecessary or even harmful 
hoops to get the abortion care they 
needed: patients who had to endure 
invasive ultrasounds that were medi-
cally unnecessary before they could get 
an abortion; patients who were har-
assed going in and out of a clinic; pa-
tients who had to drive hours or even 
days to get to the nearest abortion pro-
vider or who zeroed out their bank ac-
count to afford a plane ticket or 
childcare; patients, including many in 
Texas, who didn’t have the means to 
get the abortion care they needed and 
were forced to stay pregnant when they 
did not want to be. 
And then the Supreme Court took on 
a direct challenge to Roe that threat-
ens the constitutional right to abor-
tion. I have heard nonstop from people 
who are very anxious about their fu-
ture, people who are scared and frus-
trated, people who, like the majority of 
Americans, want to protect Roe, who 
want to live in a country where every-
one can make their own decisions 
about pregnancy and parenting—free 
from political interference. 
That is exactly why I am fighting so 
hard to protect the right to abortion at 
the Federal level by passing the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act. That bill 
will safeguard Roe and help make its 
promises a reality for everyone, no 
matter their ZIP Code, by ensuring 
their constitutional right to abortion 
is not undermined by State abortion 
bans and restrictions. 
But Republican attacks from every 
angle, like the one we will witness now, 
means there is no one easy fix. 
We have got to do everything we can 
to undo the damage the extreme Re-
publicans have caused in our laws and 
in our lives. And that is why I am 
fighting so hard for the over-the- 
counter birth control and to make 
health insurance companies follow the 
law rather than forcing patients to pay 
out of pocket for contraception. 
It is why I am fighting to make a his-
toric investment in title X family plan-
ning 
centers, 
which 
help 
make 
healthcare like birth control, STI 
screenings, and more available to ev-
eryone, regardless of their income. 
And it is why I am asking for every-
one to join me in this fight. It is going 
to take all of us working together to 
protect reproductive rights, and there 
is no action too small. 
Share your story. Speak up about 
what reproductive rights mean to you. 
Support a local organization helping to 
get 
patients 
the 
reproductive 
healthcare they need. Work to combat 
Republicans’ misinformation. Fight to 
pass local and State laws protecting 
abortion rights. 
And here is something to remember 
while you do it: It is true that extreme 
Republicans have worked nonstop to 
roll back progress on reproductive 
rights and that abortion access is at 
risk like never before. 
But this is also true: Since Roe, mil-
lions and millions of American women 
and men grew up knowing access to 
abortion is a constitutional right. Mil-
lions and millions more saw how much 
Roe opened doors for women and em-
powered people to make their own per-
sonal decisions about their body and 
their future. 
The vast majority of Americans be-
lieve people should be trusted to make 
their own decisions about whether or 
not to get an abortion and that wheth-
er and when to get pregnant is a per-
sonal decision, not a decision that 
should be made by any politician or 
taken away from them because of how 
much money they have or where they 
live.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S366 
January 20, 2022 
We can make this a reality, but we 
have got to fight for it. That is what I 
am doing; that is what I am going to 
keep doing; and I am very glad to have 
so many people alongside. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
guess I am one of those extreme Repub-
licans that believe that a child who 
sucks their thumb, wiggles their toes 
and fingers, feels pain, has a beating 
heart, has a functioning nervous sys-
tem, has DNA that is different than the 
mom or the dad is a baby. 
I didn’t think that was an extreme 
position to see a child as self-evident. 
That is a child. Now, I understand 
Americans are divided on whether chil-
dren in the womb are convenient or in-
convenient, and if they are inconven-
ient, they can be thrown away as med-
ical waste, but if they are convenient, 
they are kept. 
I just think every child is precious, 
and I think every child should be hon-
ored and protected. So I guess that 
makes me extreme. 
The bill that I bring today is a bill 
that just looks at the millions and mil-
lions and millions of Americans who 
believe like I do. Many of them work in 
hospitals, 
and 
they 
joined 
the 
healthcare profession and got a med-
ical degree because they wanted to 
save life. They wanted to be a part of 
protecting individuals at their most 
critical times, but they also had this 
real belief—that is a science-based be-
lief, by the way—that a child in the 
womb is just like a child outside the 
womb, the only difference is time. 
Forty weeks ago, you were 40 weeks 
younger. That child in the womb at 
conception and the child outside the 
womb is just 40 weeks older, just like 
you are 40 weeks older than what you 
were 40 weeks ago. It is still a child. 
For the millions of Americans who 
believe like that, we have had con-
science-protection laws on the books, 
for a long time. In fact, there are 25 
conscience-protection 
laws 
on 
the 
books in America right now. Many of 
these have not been controversial. In 
fact, if we go through the church 
amendments, when they were done, 
they protect the conscience rights of 
individuals and entities that object to 
performing or assisting in the perform-
ance of abortions or sterilizations 
against their religious beliefs or moral 
convictions. 
When that passed, almost 50 years 
ago now, it passed 92 to 1 in this body. 
It just wasn’t that controversial. We 
understood that people disagreed on 
the issue of abortion. And why would 
you ever compel someone to be able to 
perform an abortion when their con-
science objects to that? 
In 2004, Congress created the Weldon 
amendment. It is on all of our annual 
appropriations 
bills. 
The 
Weldon 
amendment bars Federal Government, 
State and local government, and re-
cipients of Federal funds from dis-
criminating against healthcare entities 
that refuse to provide, pay for, or pro-
vide coverage or refer for abortions. It 
has not been that controversial. 
In fact, it was on the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act last year, which 
passed 92 to 6. This has not been that 
controversial to be able to honor the 
rights of individuals. 
Now, there are some things that have 
changed. Some of these 25 laws have 
not been enforced. In fact, these 25 con-
science protections that are on our 
books right now are dependent on the 
executive branch to actually enforce 
those laws. If I go back during the 
Trump administration, they confronted 
California because California mandated 
that insurance providers had to provide 
abortion coverage. Well, that is not 
consistent with our law. 
And so the administration pushed 
them and said: No, you can’t compel a 
religious institution that has a moral 
objection to abortion in your State; 
you can’t make them buy abortion cov-
erage and actually pay into that sys-
tem—though California is. 
So the Trump administration said to 
them: No, you have got to allow those 
folks to have the option; that is the 
Federal law. And that was in the proc-
ess of being enforced until this admin-
istration took the leadership and Xa-
vier Becerra, who was the attorney 
general of California, then moved to 
HHS and immediately dropped the suit 
against California, his old State—curi-
ous. 
So the religious entities don’t have 
any recourse in California because the 
executive branch won’t enforce it. 
Let me give you another example. 
There was an employer, University of 
Vermont Medical Center. They were 
pressed with a lawsuit against them for 
knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly 
violating 
the 
Church 
amendments. 
They had nurses that were there that 
said: I have a conscience issue. I don’t 
want to participate in abortion, and 
the University of Vermont Medical 
Center would compel them to perform 
abortions or they would lose their job. 
It is in direct violation of Federal 
law and the conscience protections. So 
there was a lawsuit against them to be 
able to have them actually carry out 
Federal law. 
When the Biden administration came 
in, 
Xavier 
Becerra 
immediately 
dropped that lawsuit. There was no set-
tlement. There was no statement about 
it. Though it is Federal law that you 
can’t violate someone’s conscience pro-
tections, they said: We are not going to 
enforce that Federal law—though it 
was in the process of being enforced. 
So the question is, For religious enti-
ties in California or for a nurse in 
Vermont, where do they go? If the enti-
ty that is charged under Federal law— 
25 Federal laws, to be exact, to actu-
ally allow people to have conscience 
protections—if that entity says, ‘‘We 
won’t do it,’’ what happens? 
Well, this bill is very straight-
forward. It just gives the ability for 
that individual to be able to press a 
suit for their own rights. 
If the Federal Government will not 
enforce the law, this allows that indi-
vidual to step up and say: Then, I will 
then file charges that you are in viola-
tion of Federal law for this—to protect 
their rights as a citizen. 
Quite frankly, it is not any different 
than what any other citizen would do 
anywhere else—that if they had some 
civil violation against them that was 
clearly in violation of their rights, 
they would be able to go to court and 
be able to say: My rights have been vio-
lated; here is the statute. And they 
would have their day in court. 
That is not allowed currently in Fed-
eral law. It has to be the executive 
branch to carry it out. And, as we have 
learned, it is under the whims of the 
executive branch whether they are 
going to carry that out or not. 
But, listen, this is really not that 
controversial in America. The most re-
cent survey that was done by the 
Knights of Columbus that actually just 
came out this week asked a question 
about conscience protections. It was a 
very straightforward question. And the 
answer came back: 75 percent of the in-
dividuals surveyed said that doctors 
and nurses should not be forced to per-
form abortions if they have a religious 
objection. 
Now, we are very divided on the issue 
of abortion, but our Nation is really 
not that divided on the issue of con-
science protections. This is, Can an em-
ployer compel someone to do some-
thing that violates their religious be-
liefs or moral beliefs? And if they 
don’t, they lose their job. That is the 
only question that is in this, and that 
is why I bring it to this body today. 
That is my simple request. 
Now, this body knows, and Senator 
MURRAY, who is on the floor with me 
today, knows full well of my beliefs 
about the value of every single child. I 
do look forward to a day that we are 
post-Roe as a nation and the Supreme 
Court of the United States is not com-
pelling every State to have abortions 
carried out that are elective abortions 
in their State. 
A post-Roe nation is not a nation 
that has no abortion. It is a nation 
where, State to State, each State 
makes those decisions. 
I have brought bills dealing with ev-
erything from chemical abortions to 
20-week, pain-capable bills dealing with 
Down syndrome children, dealing with 
Planned Parenthood, dealing with all 
sorts of different issues. 
This issue today is very specific, 
though—just about conscientious ob-
jectors. Should they be compelled to 
violate their beliefs by their employer? 
So as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 401 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. I further ask that the bill 
be considered read a third time and

sider be considered made and laid upon

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. MURRAY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, to 
the Chair, we will as a nation process 
through this in the days ahead. This 
body has very strict laws that cover 
my State and many other States for a 
lot of other things. 
In my State, if you go to build a 
building in the southeast part of my 
State, you have to do frequent inspec-
tions to make sure the burying beetle 
is not going to be harmed in that area 
because it is considered threatened. 
If you are in the western part of my 
State, you can’t build certain buildings 
in certain places or carry out certain 
farming activities because the lesser 
prairie-chicken is there. 
If you are in California, they pour 
their water—their great water—out of 
the mountains into the ocean because 
if they don’t, it may harm the smelt. 
If you are building a bridge in Okla-
homa, at certain times of the year, and 
a migratory bird puts up a nest in that 
construction area, you have to stop 
construction, because migratory bird 
eggs are valuable, burying beetles are 
valuable, prairie-chickens are valuable, 
smelts are available, but we throw chil-
dren in the trash. 
We have got to figure this out as a 
nation, and, currently, we seem to be 
afraid to talk about it or even to pro-
tect the rights of individuals who dis-
agree about this in the workplace. We 
have got to figure this out as a nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Wyoming. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
Democrats’ radical agenda. 
For weeks now, America has been 
breaking 
records 
with 
cases 
of 
coronavirus. The scavenger hunt for 
tests has resulted in long lines and 
empty shelves. We have just had the 
worst jobs report of the year—last 
year—with inflation at a 40-year high. 
Crime is out of control in big cities run 
by Democrats. The southern border is 
being overrun by hundreds of thou-
sands of illegal immigrants every sin-
gle month. Our foreign policy is in 
shambles; our friends are endangered; 
and Vladimir Putin, China, North 
Korea, and Iran are emboldened. 
The American people are deeply wor-
ried about all of these issues. Yet 
Democrats in Washington are offering 
no solutions on these pressing prob-
lems. Democrats created many of these 
crises in the first place, often through 
incompetence, 
mismanagement, 
and 
weakness. Now, under President Biden, 
they are making them worse. 
Democrats just spent 5 months try-
ing to pass the most expensive spend-
ing bill in American history. It was a 
bill nobody asked for except for the 
radical base of professional activists. 
The bill would have led to the largest 
tax increase in 50 years, trillions of 
dollars in new spending and new debt, 
and even higher inflation. 
Democrats tried to pass this on the 
narrowest 
of 
margins. 
Democrats 
failed. As soon as the bill was pro-
nounced dead, Democrats scrambled to 
change the subject. Democrats know 
they can’t solve the inflation crisis, 
the supply chain crisis, the coronavirus 
crisis, or any of the other disasters cre-
ated by the Biden administration. By 
ignoring these problems, they are prac-
tically admitting that, as Democrats, 
they have no solutions. 
So what are they doing instead? 
Well, they have tried to manufacture 
another crisis. They have invented a 
phony moral panic about election laws. 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS have re-
peatedly lied about our elections. They 
got Major League Baseball to move the 
All-Star Game to a Democrat State. 
They got Hollywood stars and journal-
ists and wealthy corporations to parrot 
their talking points. Now they have 
former Presidents Obama and Clinton 
getting involved. It has been a shame-
ful effort to frighten the American peo-
ple and further divide our Nation. 
When Joe Biden was a Presidential 
candidate, he said he would ‘‘heal the 
country.’’ He said he would ‘‘restore 
the soul of the nation.’’ Just 1 year 
into his Presidency, we have found out 
that that was all for show. Joe Biden 
has been one of the most divisive and 
partisan Presidents in American his-
tory, and, today, he is on track to be 
the least popular President in modern 
times. 
I understand why Democrats are des-
perate to change the subject. Yet 
Democrats are failing on the election 
issue as well. If Democrats think they 
can win on the idea of a Federal elec-
tion takeover, they are wrong. Joe 
Biden is so unpopular in Georgia he 
couldn’t even get Stacey Abrams to 
show up to his rally in Atlanta. She is 
running for Governor. She is a political 
celebrity. Election law is her main 
issue. Yet she wouldn’t be seen in pub-
lic with Joe Biden, and, frankly, I don’t 
blame her. 
Two days later, Joe Biden came to 
Capitol Hill to convince Democrats to 
change the rules of the Senate. He 
failed again. Brave Democratic Sen-
ators did the honorable and courageous 
thing. They kept their word. They said 
they would not destroy this institution 
for short-term partisan gain. They de-
serve the respect of every Member of 
this body. Joe Biden tried to push them 
around, and he failed. 
The latest Quinnipiac poll has Joe 
Biden with a 33-percent approval rating 
just 1 year into his term in office. He 
has lower economic approval ratings 
than Jimmy Carter. Yet Senator SCHU-
MER asked Democrat Senators to fol-
low Joe Biden over the cliff. 
Yesterday, in his almost 2-hour press 
conference, 
President 
Biden 
talked 
about taking his message on the road 
and campaigning with Democrat can-
didates. I want to see which Democrat 
candidates actually want to stand with 
him as more and more Members of the 
House announce their retirements be-
cause they know, and they can see the 
writing on the wall. 
Senator SCHUMER wanted a vote in 
this body on the Washington election 
takeover and on changing the rules of 
the Senate. The American people have 
utterly rejected both of these ideas. 
The vast majority of the American peo-
ple support voter identification. If you 
want a ballot, show your ID. They sup-
port making voters show a photo ID in 
order to get a ballot. This includes a 
majority of Democrats, who think it is 
an important thing to do for ballot in-
tegrity and accountability and secu-
rity. 
If Democrats want to fix our election 
laws, they ought to do something about 
what is happening in the majority lead-
er’s hometown. Just last month, the 
New York City Council voted to let 
900,000 noncitizens vote in New York 
City’s elections—noncitizens. This is a 
larger group than the margin of vic-
tory in this last New York mayoral 
election. In other words, this new 
group of voters—not citizens of the 
United States—could swing and deter-
mine the outcome of the next election 
for the mayor of New York. This is the 
majority leader’s hometown. 
Where is the ballot integrity, ac-
countability, and security there for 
American citizens? 
Before CHUCK SCHUMER lectures the 
American people about our elections, 
he ought to fix the problems in his own 
hometown. 
Democrats are OK with vaccine pass-
ports, and they are OK with nonciti-
zens voting, but they are not OK with 
voter ID, at least on the legislation 
that they brought to the floor. Demo-
crats continue to fail to listen to and 
to fail the American people. Democrats 
are failing on inflation, on coronavirus, 
on immigration, on crime, and on na-
tional security. By voting on elections 
and on Senate rules, Democrats are ad-
mitting they have absolutely nothing 
to offer the American people on the 
key issues and concerns that are im-
pacting the lives of people all across 
this country. 
There is plenty of work to do right 
now. We have to stop unnecessary gov-
ernment spending to get inflation 
under control. We need to support law 
enforcement. We need affordable en-
ergy. That is what people want. We 
need to make sure that our schools 
stay open. We need to make sure that 
they teach our children skills, not ide-
ology. We need to secure our border. 
So, yes, there is plenty of work for this 
Senate to do. Republicans have been 
more than willing to work with Demo-
crats on all of these important issues. 
The American people are looking for 
solutions. Yet the majority leader is 
giving them pointless exercises and 
show votes. It is time for the majority

leader to abandon this political wish 
list. Let’s get to work on the issues 
facing the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 137 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, one of the 
aims of American foreign aid is to as-
sist countries in times of need. This 
spirit exemplifies a trait Americans 
and Utahns rightfully value, that of 
giving to those in need. 
Yet, for many years, our foreign aid 
dollars in support of abortion have 
been used to impose violent cultural 
imperialism. Instead of helping to pre-
serve, strengthen, and sustain the lives 
of women and children abroad, our tax-
payer dollars have been used to harm 
women’s lives and to end the lives of 
their unborn children, especially baby 
girls. In some of these countries, girls 
are disproportionately aborted pre-
cisely because they are female. U.S. aid 
is used not to affirm the equal dignity 
of women but to violently deny it. 
In some of these countries, abortion 
is forced on women who don’t even 
want abortions, women in countries 
like Vietnam and Peru, for instance, 
who were forced to endure the coercive 
abortion and sterilization campaigns of 
the 1990s, just to name a couple of ex-
amples. 
What kind of aid does violence to 
women and girls? What kind of help is 
it to impose U.S. abortion extremism 
on countries that culturally and demo-
cratically reject it or contribute to 
international organizations that allow 
regimes to use abortion as a tool of op-
pression? What kind of progress is it to 
encourage sex-selective abortion and 
the denigration of human dignity for 
both the baby and the mother? 
U.S. advocacy abroad for the taking 
of innocent, unborn life is not pro- 
woman, it is not pro-child, and it is not 
pro-healthcare. It is pro-sexism. It is 
pro-violence. And we must end it. 
According to recent polling, the 
American 
people 
overwhelmingly 
agree. Nearly 60 percent of Americans 
oppose using tax dollars to pay for 
abortions, and more than 75 percent of 
Americans oppose using tax dollars to 
support abortions in other countries. 
Thankfully, 
President 
Ronald 
Reagan took steps to reverse this sup-
port, starting in 1984, instituting the 
Mexico City policy to prohibit foreign 
aid from going to organizations that 
provide or promote abortions or that 
advocate to change abortion laws in a 
foreign country. Since then, the policy 
has, unfortunately, been rescinded and 
reinstated again and again, repeating 
this cycle between changing adminis-
trations. 
Another policy that used to have 
lasting support is the Hyde amend-
ment. This legal provision prohibited 
the use of Federal funds to pay for 
abortion with a set of exceptions. Re-
cently, Democrats have abandoned this 
bipartisan position and have placed the 
Hyde amendment under threat. It, too, 
could become a back-and-forth, ping 
pong policy, depending on who holds 
majorities within the two Houses of 
Congress. 
The lives of babies and the dignity of 
women and girls are not political foot-
balls. Women and unborn children ev-
erywhere have immeasurable dignity 
and eternal worth regardless of where 
they are from, and they are entitled to 
the right to life and protection from 
harm regardless of who happens to be 
in office from one moment to the next. 
The Protecting Life in Foreign As-
sistance Act affirms this truth. This 
bill would permanently stop the use of 
our foreign aid money from funding or 
promoting abortions overseas. 
In our laws and through our lives, we 
must uphold the dignity of each and 
every human person regardless of race, 
regardless of sex, and regardless of ap-
pearance, abilities, or age. The meas-
ure before us today does just that, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. The 
lives of millions of women and chil-
dren, born and unborn, depend on it. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Foreign Relations be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 137 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from the Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, my col-
league and friend from Utah and I 
agree on a couple of points. Yes, Presi-
dent Biden did rescind the global gag 
rule, which this proposal would not 
only reestablish but make permanent 
and expand, disastrously, and yes, 
women and children should not be po-
litical footballs, nor should this issue 
be one. Unfortunately, that is the ob-
jective of this proposal. 
It is difficult to exaggerate the 
breadth of this proposed legislation or 
the breadth of harm that the global 
gag rule does. In fact, it prohibits for-
eign organizations receiving U.S. as-
sistance from providing legal abortion 
services or referrals or even informa-
tion—information—on abortion serv-
ices even when those activities are 
funded without any connection to U.S. 
Government 
money. 
It 
egregiously 
blocks organizations receiving U.S. 
funds from advocating for abortion leg-
islation—mere advocacy—stifling their 
ability to champion their patients, 
even if that advocacy is not funded in 
any way by U.S. taxpayers. 
This legislation would not only cod-
ify this dangerous policy but expand it 
even beyond what was implemented 
under 
previous 
administrations—ex-
panding it, not just codifying it. 
Thankfully, President Biden has re-
scinded this policy. It was an impor-
tant effort to restore U.S. leadership 
abroad, promoting healthcare access in 
places it is needed most. It was a crit-
ical step toward what is now needed— 
permanent prohibition of the global 
gag rule, not codification of its expan-
sion. 
Let’s be very clear. The global gag 
rule does nothing to protect the health 
of people around the world. It blocks 
healthcare access, it stifles local advo-
cacy efforts, and it undermines repro-
ductive rights worldwide, putting in 
jeopardy the people who need those 
services most. It impedes access to a 
range of health services, including con-
traception, HIV prevention and treat-
ment, and maternal and child care, be-
cause it cuts off funding for many of 
the most experienced healthcare pro-
viders. 
Some proponents of this dangerous 
policy seem to claim it will reduce 
abortions or it is intended to do so, but 
studies have shown that, in fact, it 
does just the opposite. The global gag 
rule actually increases rates of abor-
tion—many of them unsafe—because it 
reduces access to contraceptives and it 
increases the number of unintended 
pregnancies. 
In short, we should be joining other 
countries in addressing global goals 
like creating an AIDS-free generation, 
ending preventable maternal and child 
deaths, and achieving universal access 
to sexual and reproductive healthcare, 
not putting unnecessary restrictions 
on U.S. funds that cause fear and im-
pede access to healthcare. Unfortu-
nately, that is what the global gag rule 
and this legislation do, impeding coun-
tries’ efforts to improve global health, 
advance human rights, and achieve 
gender equality. 
I oppose the Lee bill. I urge my col-
leagues to come together and work, in-
stead, to promote global health. There-
fore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have tre-
mendous respect for my friend and col-
league, the distinguished Senator from 
Connecticut. He and I both acknowl-
edge that the policy we are arguing— 
the nature of the policy is one in which 
we have seen something of a tug-of- 
war, a ping pong match over the years. 
The Republican legislation will put 
in place or restore the so-called Mexico 
City policy, prohibiting U.S. foreign 
aid from going to organizations that 
perform or advocate for abortion over-
seas. It is backed by an estimated 75 
percent of Americans who don’t believe 
that we should be using U.S. taxpayer 
dollars especially to further the cause 
of conducting or advocating for abor-
tions overseas. 
He and I both agree that President 
Biden has rescinded that. I think where 
we disagree can be highlighted and 
traced back to the fact that we call it 
by different names. He refers to this as

the gag rule, a gag rule. Now, normally 
when we think of a gag rule, we think 
of something that tells someone who is 
otherwise free to speak that they may 
not speak. It is, in fact, what happens 
when we don’t allow people to live. It is 
what happens to all these baby girls 
who are never allowed to be born pre-
cisely because they are female. And 
make no mistake, when we fund abor-
tions overseas, that is what is hap-
pening. It happens a lot in countries 
that receive our aid in the absence of 
the Mexico City policy. Some of that 
goes to these organizations that per-
form abortions. 
In many of these countries, sex-selec-
tive abortions are not only tolerated 
culturally, 
they 
are 
commonplace. 
They are excessive. As a result, these 
baby girls never get to be born. They 
never get to become women. They 
never get to speak in the first place. 
That is a form of gagging. That is not 
OK. 
Regardless of how you feel about 
abortion, regardless of whether you 
think that is a baby, a human life, or 
whether you think it is something 
else—I am not sure what else it could 
be. When someone becomes pregnant, 
we know that is the potential of what 
will one day be a human being. Absent 
a death—whether a natural death or a 
death brought about by someone’s ac-
tions or by the operation of a disease 
or medical condition or surgical inter-
vention in the case of abortion—it is a 
person. We shouldn’t lose sight of that. 
I 
have 
difficulty 
accepting 
the 
premise that the only solution to this 
is continuing to fund organizations 
that perform or advocate for abortions 
overseas. I reject the premise that any-
thing we do in this area to withhold 
those funds will necessarily result in 
more abortions. 
As far as the suggestion that organi-
zations could receive these funds and 
still perform abortions and that not 
translate into U.S. dollars being used 
to perform abortions, I reject that 
premise as well for the same reason 
that I reject the premise that Planned 
Parenthood isn’t using taxpayer dol-
lars to perform abortions. It is. It is 
spent differently. It is a matter of ac-
counting, but it sustains and supports 
an organization that itself advocates 
for 
and 
performs 
many 
abortions. 
These are, in fact, human lives, and the 
American people are, in fact, very un-
comfortable with the idea that we are 
funding abortions with their taxpayer 
dollars, and we are doing it overseas. 
We shouldn’t do that. This shouldn’t be 
controversial. I look forward to the day 
when it is not. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
just to be clear, I understand my col-
league’s point, but I think I have high-
lighted and I want to emphasize again 
the limited purposes for which our tax-
payer dollars are used and the advo-
cacy, the healthcare, the contracep-
tion, HIV screening and treatment— 
world health—that would be prevented 
by this legislation. 
I think that is an unintended con-
sequence. Maybe, it is unintended that 
it is gargantuan in its potential im-
pact, and, therefore, I continue my ob-
jection. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I am 
here to speak on a nomination, but be-
fore I do, a point of personal privilege. 
It was 1 year ago today that I had the 
honor of being sworn in as a Member of 
this Senate. As I hope my wife is 
watching at home on C–SPAN 2, I just 
want to thank her for her love and sup-
port throughout this first year. I 
couldn’t have done it without her. 
And I thank, of course, the Presiding 
Officer and all of our colleagues for the 
tremendous support and experience 
that this last year has been. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. President, with respect to the 
Thomas nomination, I ask unanimous 
consent that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table and the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CONFIRMATION OF HOLLY A. THOMAS 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I was 
hoping to rise prior to the vote just a 
little while ago but was consumed with 
the agenda in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee this morning. 
So in lieu of speaking prior to the 
confirmation vote, I rise to applaud the 
confirmation of Judge Holly Thomas to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. Judge Thomas is a dedicated 
advocate for equality under the law 
and has made a career of fighting to 
ensure the civil rights of all Ameri-
cans. 
A proud native of San Diego, CA, and 
a graduate of Yale Law School, Judge 
Thomas spent 10 years working on civil 
rights litigation and appeals. That 
time included litigating at the NAACP 
Legal Defense Fund, in the U.S. De-
partment of Justice’s Civil Rights Divi-
sion, and in the New York Solicitor 
General’s Office. 
In each of these roles, Judge Thomas 
was a tireless advocate for equal jus-
tice. She proved to be a skillful appel-
late lawyer, an insightful thinker, and 
a valued colleague. 
She returned to California in 2016 to 
serve as the chief liaison between the 
California Department of Fair Employ-
ment and Housing and the Governor’s 
Office. The State Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing is Califor-
nia’s largest civil rights regulatory 
body, and in her role there Judge 
Thomas dedicated herself to protecting 
workers and families from unlawful 
discrimination, working closely with 
then-Governor Brown. 
Recognizing her outstanding work 
and her tremendous talent, Governor 
Brown appointed her to the Los Ange-
les County Superior Court in 2018. Now, 
this appointment was a full-circle mo-
ment for a person whose love of the law 
was nurtured by her supportive parents 
starting at a very young age. Judge 
Thomas’s parents, when she was a 
young girl, would take her to watch 
court proceedings. Why? So that she 
could imagine what a career as a law-
yer would look like. 
Decades later, as a judge on the supe-
rior court, Judge Thomas actually re-
quested to serve in the family law divi-
sion because of her empathy for fami-
lies going through a difficult process 
and experience in court. 
Now, as the first person in her family 
to go to college after high school, 
Judge Thomas knows what it is like to 
navigate unfamiliar institutions. She 
is also the granddaughter of share-
croppers, and she is a passionate fight-
er for equal justice. 
Since her appointment, Judge Thom-
as has proven her excellence as a jurist, 
as a neutral arbiter, and a compas-
sionate voice for justice both in family 
court and on the California Court of 
Appeal, where she served in a pro tem 
capacity for 6 months. 
Judge 
Thomas’s 
compassion 
is 
matched 
by 
her 
legal 
acumen. 
Throughout her career, she has distin-
guished herself with thoughtful anal-
ysis, expert judgment, and unshakeable 
commitment to civil rights. 
I know—and I am thrilled—that 
Judge Thomas will serve with distinc-
tion on the Ninth Circuit, and I con-
gratulate her on this very well-de-
served confirmation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE DEMOCRACY DEFENSE LEND-LEASE ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day I was dismayed to hear the Presi-
dent of the United States suggest that 
a Russian invasion of Ukraine might 
not provoke a powerful response by the 
United States and our allies. 
Now, I am grateful that the Press 
Secretary did issue a statement subse-
quently which seemed to clarify the 
strong commitment that the American 
people—from the administration to the 
Members of Congress—have to assist 
our Ukrainian allies in their efforts to 
deter or defeat Russian aggression. I 
believe we have a duty to stand with 
Ukraine and our European allies as 
they attempt to defend their democ-
racies. 
Strong language and threats of sanc-
tions have their place, but they are not 
enough to deter Vladimir Putin. We 
need to take concrete steps to deter 
the likelihood of a Russian attack in 
any form. 
But it is not just the executive 
branch of the U.S. Government that

has a role to play. We in Congress have 
a role we can play, too, in sending a 
very clear message to Vladimir Putin 
that we will not stand idly by while he 
attacks a neighbor, a democracy, and a 
potential future member of NATO. 
To that end, I have introduced bipar-
tisan legislation called the Ukraine De-
mocracy Defense Lend-Lease Act to en-
sure Ukrainian forces have the weap-
ons that they need to deter that ag-
gression 
and 
defend, 
if 
necessary, 
against a Russian invasion. 
Of course, students of history remem-
ber the importance of lend-lease back 
in World War II, back when America 
was officially neutral in the conflict 
initiated by Nazi Germany in Europe 
and during a time when the American 
people were of an isolationist frame of 
mind. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
throwing a lifeline to Great Britain 
and our other allies, Congress passed 
on a bipartisan basis the Lend-Lease 
Act, which ultimately resulted in $30 
billion worth of materiel being deliv-
ered to Britain and our other allies to 
help them defeat Nazi Germany. 
So, in a similar vein, this legislation 
authorizes the President to enter into 
lend-lease agreements with Ukraine 
and provide the military equipment 
necessary to protect the Ukrainian 
people from Russian aggression. No one 
is suggesting that American troops 
should be on the ground, but we are 
saying clearly that it is our responsi-
bility to provide the Ukrainians every-
thing they need in order to defend 
themselves. 
This legislation would once again, in 
the immortal words of Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt, allow us to serve as the ar-
senal of democracy, just as we did in 
World War II, and provide Ukraine with 
the lethal weapons they need to pro-
tect themselves against the Russian 
threat. 
Make no mistake, America stands 
with Ukraine, and we will do every-
thing we can, again, on a bipartisan 
basis—the executive branch, the legis-
lative branch—to support our friends 
and to defeat a Russian invasion and 
allow them to protect their democracy. 
Vladimir 
Putin’s 
stated 
concerns 
about Ukraine are completely a false 
narrative, particularly with regard to 
his stated concerns about Ukraine be-
coming a part of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, which, as we all 
know, is purely defensive in nature. 
Vladimir Putin has called the fall of 
the Soviet Union one of the greatest 
geopolitical tragedies of the 20th cen-
tury, and clearly he is of a mind to re-
gain that lost territory as a result of 
the fall of the Soviet Union and, if nec-
essary, do it by force. That is what 
Putin is up to, and we should not be 
confused about that. 
I am proud to have worked with Sen-
ators CARDIN and WICKER and Senators 
SHAHEEN, GRAHAM, and BLUMENTHAL on 
this legislation, and I hope more of our 
colleagues—again, 
on 
a 
bipartisan 
basis—will join us in advancing this 
bill and making sure that our Ukrain-
ian friends have everything they need 
to deter, if possible, Russian aggression 
and, if that is not possible, to make 
sure that Vladimir Putin pays a heavy 
price for attacking Ukraine. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, on another matter, it 
was 1 year ago today when we were all 
on the Capitol steps on a cold January 
20, 2020, following the election of Joe 
Biden as President of the United States 
and KAMALA HARRIS as Vice President. 
Exactly 365 days ago, we were out there 
on the Capitol steps and heard what I 
believed to be an important and wel-
comed speech by the President, where 
the President said he would serve to be 
a unifying force in Washington. 
He said: 
[W]ithout unity there is no peace, only bit-
terness and fury. No progress, only exhaust-
ing outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. 
Wonderful, inspirational words. 
But now we find ourselves, a year 
into the Biden administration, with a 
lot of bitterness, fury, and outrage over 
the many failures and missteps of this 
administration. One of the pillars of 
the 
President’s 
campaign 
was 
the 
promise of a strong Federal response to 
the pandemic. 
Mr. Biden said: 
I am never going to raise the white flag 
and surrender. We’re going to beat this virus. 
We’re going to get it under control, I prom-
ise you. 
That is a quote. 
One year later, we are nowhere close 
to having this virus under control. New 
daily 
cases 
are 
breaking 
records, 
threatening the capacity of intensive 
care units and hospitals across the 
country. Healthcare workers are once 
again exhausted after having been 
pushed to their limits—mentally and 
physically. And, perhaps most embar-
rassingly, affordable, reliable tests are 
increasingly hard to come by. 
We know testing is one of the most 
valuable resources we have when it 
comes to this virus. I remember calling 
my Governor, and I said: What do you 
need, Governor? 
This is at the beginning of the pan-
demic. 
He said: I need two things. 
He said: I need testing, and I need 
PPE—personal protective equipment. 
Well, that is another story about our 
vulnerable supply chains and the fact 
that we have outsourced the manufac-
turing of personal protective equip-
ment to China, which is the main rea-
son we had a lack of access to what we 
needed. 
But as to testing, the sooner positive 
cases 
are 
identified, 
the 
better 
equipped we are as individuals to quar-
antine ourselves, seek medical atten-
tion—if necessary—or, if all else fails, 
to just ride out the virus without in-
fecting other people. 
Even before taking the oath of office, 
President Biden promised to make free 
testing widely available. But months 
and months went by without the Presi-
dent taking any significant action to 
prevent the current testing shortage. 
Last month, the White House Press 
Secretary even mocked a reporter who 
asked if the United States should pro-
vide free at-home tests, just as other 
countries have done around the world. 
It looks like it took swift criticism of 
her remark to finally prompt some ac-
tion. Just a couple of days ago, the 
White House launched a website for 
people who wanted to request free at- 
home tests. But I am afraid it is a case 
of too little, too late. 
Many experts have said that Omicron 
has already peaked in parts of the 
country. By the time these tests ship, 
which the website says could take 7 to 
12 days, we will be even closer to the 
beginning of the end of this current 
wave of Omicron. 
Instead, the White House could have 
purchased 
and 
distributed 
massive 
quantities of tests at any point over 
the last year, but it did not do so. In-
creased access to testing could have 
lessened the impact of the Omicron 
variant over the summer as well as the 
contagious variant that we are con-
fronting today. So it shouldn’t take 
bad press to force the administration 
to action, especially when they made a 
commitment to free testing early on 
but, obviously, were unprepared for 
Omicron and the wave of new cases. 
Unfortunately, the President has bro-
ken another big promise about his plan 
to address the pandemic. He vowed 
that public health decisions would be 
made by public health professionals, 
not politicians. 
Once again, things have played out 
quite a bit differently. Here is one ex-
ample. Last February, the Centers for 
Disease Control released a report that 
said that schools are not a breeding 
ground for COVID–19 and that as long 
as precautions are taken, schools could 
open safely. 
Well, Congress did not skimp when it 
came to providing financial resources 
to the States and school districts to 
take those appropriate precautions to 
help preserve the safety of our chil-
dren. But the science was at odds with 
the demands of a key political con-
stituency—teachers 
unions, 
which 
wanted schools to remain closed even if 
the teachers were vaccinated and ap-
propriate safety measures could be 
taken to protect the schoolchildren. 
We all know which side the administra-
tion chose. It ignored the science and 
stood with their political constituency, 
the teachers’ unions. 
When the President’s big promise of a 
strong pandemic response failed to 
meet the need, he shifted the responsi-
bility to the States. He said: I am 
going to do it. The Federal Govern-
ment is going to do it. But then, amaz-
ingly, pivoted and said: Well, this is 
not my responsibility. This is not the 
Federal Government’s responsibility. 
This is the State’s responsibility. 
Just a few weeks ago, he actually 
said these words. He said: There is no 
Federal solution. This gets solved at 
the State level.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S371 
January 20, 2022 
I am sure the American people were 
flabbergasted at the answer and his ob-
vious flip-flop. President Biden pledged 
to lead a strong pandemic response 
when it helped his chances of getting 
elected, but now that he is actually in 
office and has the power and authority 
to follow through, he is folding his 
hand and pointing the finger at others. 
The Biden administration has fum-
bled the ball time after time. It has 
chipped away at our energy security. 
When you saw prices rise at the pump 
because of inflation or because demand 
of refined petroleum products exceeded 
supply, he actually went so far as to 
encourage Russia and OPEC to produce 
more oil and gas. At the same time, he 
was all about canceling the permit for 
the 
Keystone 
XL 
Pipeline. 
Nord 
Stream 2—the Russian pipeline—pro-
viding gas to Germany, he is all for it. 
When it comes to domestic pipelines 
providing oil and gas to refineries so 
they can produce gasoline so that peo-
ple can drive their cars at an affordable 
price, he is not for it. 
Additionally, this administration has 
failed to address the humanitarian cri-
sis at the border, in an astonishingly 
blase´ sort of way. It doesn’t even seem 
to get a rise out of this administration 
anymore—the numbers are so high. 
There are 2 million-plus people appre-
hended at the border, with no real im-
pediment or deterrent or discouraging 
words to keep them from entering the 
country illegally. 
And then there is the fumbling of 
diplomatic relations, insulting some of 
our oldest allies and emboldening our 
biggest adversaries. The biggest exam-
ple of that was ceding the war in Af-
ghanistan to the Taliban in the most 
humiliating way possible. 
So the list of missteps and failures 
during this last 365 days has been a 
long one, indeed. But perhaps the big-
gest disappointment was in not deliv-
ering what President Biden promised 
the American people 1 year ago today, 
and that is to be a unifying force for 
our country. 
He promised, as we all heard, to bring 
people of different backgrounds and 
ideologies and beliefs together and to 
find common ground. It actually made 
sense to make a virtue out of some-
thing that a 50–50 Senate would ordi-
narily dictate, and that is: When you 
can’t have your own way because you 
don’t have the votes, then make a vir-
tue out of working together and actu-
ally pass bipartisan legislation. 
He actually went so far as to point to 
his record in the Senate as evidence of 
his ability to work across the aisle and 
broker bipartisan deals, but it didn’t 
take long for the American people to 
find out that these were, by and large, 
empty words. 
Less than 2 months into his Presi-
dency, our colleagues across the aisle 
took a hammer to Congress’s perfect 
record of bipartisan pandemic response. 
That was during the previous adminis-
tration. Almost everything we did was 
bipartisan, virtually unanimous, when 
it came to responding to the pandemic. 
First, our colleagues spent nearly $2 
trillion on a bill that even though it 
was framed as COVID–19 response, com-
mitted less than 10 percent of that 
funding to COVID–19 and only 1 percent 
to vaccines. But that blowout, $2 tril-
lion, wasn’t enough. 
The President tried and failed, along 
with his political allies, to advance the 
so-called Build Back Better agenda. 
While trying to sell this radical plan to 
the American people, President Biden 
continued to make big promises, most 
of which were not credible. He said, for 
example, that this multitrillion-dollar 
bill cost zero dollars. Nobody—no-
body—believed that. But here it was, 
the President of the United States, em-
barrassingly, for himself and others, 
was saying that $5 trillion is really 
zero dollars. He said it wouldn’t in-
crease the deficit. And he said anyone 
making less than $400,000 a year would 
not pay a single penny more in income 
tax. 
All of these claims turned out to be 
false. And in the end, Democrats 
couldn’t muster enough support to get 
the bill to the President’s desk—again, 
not particularly surprising to those 
who have been observers of the Senate 
for a while. A 50–50 Senate should tell 
you that the only way you are going to 
get things done is through bipartisan 
consensus building, not trying to do 
things all on your own with 50 votes in 
the Senate, plus a tie-breaking vote 
from the Vice President. 
But that didn’t stop our colleagues 
from turning to yet another partisan 
bill—this time, one to launch a Federal 
takeover of State-run elections. Yes-
terday, 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
brought this bill up for a vote in the 
Senate and, of course, as we now know, 
it failed to garner sufficient votes to 
pass. But no one should be surprised, 
especially because this bill was drafted 
by one party in a 50–50 Senate. 
And then when the bill failed, as we 
all knew it would, our Democratic col-
leagues took their penchant for par-
tisanship to an entirely new level. 
With the President’s blessing, some-
body who served more than three dec-
ades in the Senate and who railed 
against efforts to eliminate the fili-
buster, the 60-vote bipartisan con-
sensus requirement before bills can be 
advanced—the President, in spite of his 
previous comments supporting that re-
quirement, the so-called filibuster— 
this time, with the President’s bless-
ing, Senate Democrats tried to change 
the rules of the Senate to secure a 
purely partisan win. 
What we witnessed in the Senate yes-
terday evening was a remarkable show 
of priorities of our Democratic col-
leagues. Forget the rules, forget com-
promise, forget consensus building, and 
forget the traditions of this institu-
tion, our Democratic colleagues proved 
that they are willing to taking a 
wrecking ball to this Chamber in pur-
suit of power. 
It 
is 
no 
wonder 
that 
President 
Biden’s approval ratings continue to 
plummet. One recent poll found that 
only 33 percent of the respondents to 
that poll approved of the job that he 
was doing. After all, after everything 
the President promised, and with his 
dismal record of actually delivering on 
that promise, it is hardly surprising 
that the American people are dis-
appointed. 
In addition, inflation is up, wages are 
being eaten away by inflation, eroding 
the cost of living, and our country feels 
more divided than ever, despite the 
President’s 
extravagant 
promises 
1 
year ago today, just out here on these 
steps. 
The man who positioned himself as 
an experienced, unifying leader for the 
country has spent virtually all his time 
pursuing partisan ends. As a result, the 
Democratic Senate majority has wast-
ed a lot of valuable time. I am dis-
appointed by the wasted opportunities 
during the past year. 
Floor time in the U.S. Senate is a 
precious commodity. It is the coin of 
the realm. There are a lot of great 
ideas that occur outside of this Cham-
ber, but unless it can get time on the 
floor, it doesn’t happen. But rather 
than taking up bills that did have that 
proud, 
bipartisan 
support, 
wasting 
time on purely partisan bills has re-
sulted in very few accomplishments. 
I can only hope that the second year 
of the Biden administration will bring 
more bipartisan cooperation. Hope-
fully, the administration can learn 
from its mistakes of the last year. This 
parade of dead-on-arrival legislation 
isn’t helping the American people. The 
only way we can accomplish anything 
is by working together and building 
consensus. 
Again, voters elected a 50–50 Senate, 
a closely divided House, and a Presi-
dent who promised to bring people of 
different views together. Let’s hope 
this next year, the second year of the 
Biden administration, the President 
will see fit, along with our Democratic 
colleagues, to deliver on that commit-
ment made 1 year ago today. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Alaska. 
S.T.A.N.D. WITH TAIWAN ACT OF 2022 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
today I introduce the S.T.A.N.D. with 
Taiwan Act of 2022, which would man-
date comprehensive and devastating 
economic 
and 
financial 
sanctions 
against the Chinese Communist Party, 
key sectors of China’s economy, and 
leaders in the Chinese Communist 
Party, if the Chinese People’s Libera-
tion Army initiates a military invasion 
of the island democracy of Taiwan. 
Representative MIKE

of 
Wisconsin introduced an identical bill 
in the House today as well. 
I am hopeful that when my col-
leagues come back from recess, the 
vast majority of Senators here, Demo-
crats and Republicans, will end up join-
ing me in supporting this important 
bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S372 
January 20, 2022 
question to the INDOPACOM com-
mander, Admiral Davidson: 
Given the Chinese Communist Party’s re-
cent but long list of coercive and even vio-
lent actions—a hostile suppression of free-
dom in Hong Kong, threatening nuclear war 
with Japan, hand-to-hand combat with In-
dian soldiers in the Himalayas, economic 
blockades of Australia, genocide in its own 
Xinjiang province, [and aggressive naval ac-
tions in the South China Sea]—how do such 
actions impact your analysis [Admiral Da-
vidson] on if and when China would invade 
Taiwan? 
His response to me in this hearing 
made news around the world. He called 
these recent actions by President Xi 
‘‘alarming,’’ and then he said: 
I think the threat [of an invasion of Tai-
wan] is manifest during this decade, in fact, 
in the next 6 years. 
Six years—that is not a lot of time. 
The Senate needs to focus on this issue 
much more. Indeed, this issue is not 
unrelated to the actions of another dic-
tator—Vladimir Putin—who is right 
now threatening and likely to invade 
one of his neighbors—Ukraine. 
Now, some see the defense of Taiwan 
as a luxury we cannot afford in an age 
of sharpened and great power competi-
tion 
and 
China’s 
global 
economic 
strength. I reject that view. Impor-
tantly, so does American law, particu-
larly the Taiwan Relations Act, which 
this body passed in 1979 by a vote of 90 
to 6. Among other things, it states the 
following: 
The United States will consider any effort 
to determine the future of Taiwan by other 
than peaceful means . . . a threat to the 
peace and security of the Western Pacific 
area and of grave concern. 
The free world cannot be neutral in 
the 
contest 
between 
freedom 
and 
authoritarianism that is once again 
underway around the world, especially 
in the Indo-Pacific region. 
American alliances, power, and inge-
nuity helped build a world that pro-
vided more freedom and prosperity to 
more people than ever before. Think 
about this fact: The U.S. democracy, 
bolstered by our strong military, has 
done more to liberate humankind from 
oppression and tyranny—literally hun-
dreds of millions of people—than any 
other force in human history. 
The Chinese Communist Party knows 
exactly what it wants to accomplish— 
to make the world safe for its authori-
tarian government, to export its dicta-
torship model to other countries, to 
separate America from its democratic 
allies, and to erode U.S. leadership 
around the world. 
A world governed by Xi Jinping’s to-
talitarian vision would be a world un-
safe for America and other democracies 
around the world. That is why Taiwan 
is so central to the free world and its 
future. It is a thriving, prosperous Chi-
nese democracy that holds free elec-
tions and bounds its power by the rule 
of law. For that reason, it threatens 
the CCP’s central premise, which is 
that one man ruling in perpetuity by 
crushing all dissent knows what is best 
for 1.4 billion people. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
already crushed Hong Kong, once a bas-
tion of liberty, and the free world bare-
ly raised its voice in protest. Should 
America and the world stand by as 
China does something similar to Tai-
wan, a peaceful democracy of 25 mil-
lion people who have voted for an en-
tirely different future, that would not 
simply undermine the security of the 
Western Pacific, as the Taiwan Rela-
tions Act says. A violent military 
takeover of Taiwan by the Chinese 
Communist Party would be a sea 
change in how the world is ordered. It 
would change the history of the 21st 
century in ways that the guns of Au-
gust of 1914 changed the 20th century. 
Taiwan is not some peripheral side-
show in terms of global great-power 
competition; it is the frontline between 
freedom and tyranny, like West Berlin 
was during the height of the Cold War. 
It matters everywhere. 
Last month, the magazine the Na-
tional Review highlighted many of 
these issues in an excellent issue which 
laid out the arguments for and against 
whether the U.S. military should come 
to Taiwan’s aid if the island democracy 
was invaded by the Chinese military. 
Should our country militarily defend 
democratic 
Taiwan 
after 
the 
CCP 
launches a military invasion of the is-
land? This is a vitally important ques-
tion which was front and center in the 
National Review last month. As the 
National Review points out, there is 
much disagreement on this issue. 
There are powerful arguments on 
both sides, as this issue admirably 
demonstrates, but I believe there is 
much less disagreement on whether the 
United States should take actions now 
to deter a Chinese Communist Party 
military invasion of Taiwan in the fu-
ture. Indeed, taking actions now to 
promote deterrence of a Chinese inva-
sion of Taiwan is an area where I be-
lieve there is broad bipartisan agree-
ment and support in the U.S. Senate. 
Deterrence comes in many forms, and 
with regard to Taiwan, I believe there 
are three crucial layers of deterrence, 
as depicted here. 
First is Taiwan’s ability to militarily 
defend itself, the so-called hedgehog 
approach right here, where Taiwan 
musters sufficient self-defense capabili-
ties to make a Chinese military inva-
sion very difficult and very costly. 
The second layer of deterrence is 
America’s capability and will to defend 
Taiwan militarily should the President 
of the United States decide to do so 
once there is an invasion by the Chi-
nese. 
Over 
the 
past 
several 
decades, 
through many different crises in the 
Taiwan Strait, this layer, the Amer-
ican layer of deterrence, has proven to 
be decisive in keeping the Taiwanese 
people free. Our deep network of allies 
in the region augments this level of de-
terrence. 
As it relates to deterrence in Taiwan, 
it is really often discussed only in 
these two layers, but there is a third 
layer that is depicted here, which in 
terms of the present circumstances 
might be the most important, and that 
is the use of other instruments of 
American power beyond our military, 
such as our global economic and finan-
cial strengths, to deter China from an 
invasion. 
That is exactly what my bill, the 
S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act of 2022, is 
all about. The full name of this bill is 
Sanctions 
Targeting 
Aggressors 
of 
Neighboring 
Democracies—aka 
S.T.A.N.D.—with Taiwan. 
It is a simple bill but a very powerful 
one, especially in terms of its deterrent 
effect. It states that if the Chinese 
Communist Party initiates a military 
invasion of Taiwan, the United States 
shall impose a comprehensive suite of 
mandatory 
economic 
and 
financial 
sanctions. The bill lays out these com-
prehensive sanctions, some of which 
are listed here, in great detail. These 
sanctions would be crippling to the 
Chinese Communist Party, its leaders, 
and key sectors of China’s economy. 
The bill also calls on the United 
States to coordinate such comprehen-
sive sanctions with our allies around 
the globe, with the goal of making the 
CCP an economic pariah globally if 
President Xi chooses to militarily in-
vade Taiwan. 
The bill’s goal is to make very clear 
to President Xi today the true cost of 
what such a military invasion of Tai-
wan would be, thereby heightening de-
terrence, which we all in the U.S. Sen-
ate support. 
I believe the S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan 
Act of 2022 should receive broad bipar-
tisan support. In many ways, it rein-
forces the goals, policies, and direc-
tives of the Taiwan Relations Act, 
which continues to have overwhelming 
support here in the U.S. Senate. 
The defense of Taiwan is an issue 
that has been weaved in and out of the 
careers and professions of countless 
Americans, including my own. 
Over 25 years ago, in 1995 and 1996, I 
was a Marine infantry officer deployed 
to the Taiwan Strait as part of a Ma-
rine amphibious task force and two 
U.S. carrier strike groups, all in re-
sponse to the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s aggressive military provocations 
on the eve of Presidential elections in 
Taiwan—the Third Taiwan Strait Cri-
sis, this period is now called. That was 
an important and decisive demonstra-
tion of American commitment and re-
solve to an emerging democracy and 
partner that is still remembered today 
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
More recently, I was part of another 
demonstration of American commit-
ment and resolve when I traveled to 
Taiwan 
with 
Democrat 
Senators 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH and CHRIS COONS to 
provide vaccines—close to a million— 
from the United States for the Tai-
wanese people in the face of the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s aggressive at-
tempts to prevent the citizens of Tai-
wan from receiving these lifesaving 
Western medicines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S373 
January 20, 2022 
I am now a colonel in the Marine 
Corps Reserve, working again on these 
issues in the INDOPACOM theater. 
Let me conclude with this: American 
commitment and resolve for Taiwan 
has been part of our law, heritage, 
trade, economics, and military deploy-
ments for decades and should be for 
decades to come. The S.T.A.N.D. with 
Taiwan Act of 2022 is the next logical 
step to demonstrate America’s com-
mitment to Taiwan, this time empha-
sizing the deterrent power of our eco-
nomic and financial strengths. 
It is our values of freedom, innova-
tion, the rule of law, individual rights, 
and openness that the Chinese Com-
munist Party is most afraid of. We 
must be ready as democracies to defend 
these values or risk a world increas-
ingly governed by autocracy, surveil-
lance, aggression, and permanent con-
flict. The S.T.A.N.D. with Taiwan Act 
will help us do just that. 
TRIBUTE TO EMMA BROYLES 
Madam President, it has been a busy 
week. Let’s face it—it has been a con-
tentious week here in the U.S. Senate. 
We had a big vote last night. I spoke 
about the issues we were debating last 
night and a few times on the Senate 
floor. Just a minute ago, I introduced a 
bill of mine on a very serious topic re-
garding a possible war with China and 
Taiwan. So it has been busy. 
To be honest, my team and I were fo-
cused on a lot of these issues, and we 
were thinking about skipping my fa-
vorite part of the week—coming down 
on the Senate floor and talking about 
the Alaskan of the week—but then we 
came across a Twitter meme. You al-
most have to see it to completely un-
derstand it, but the gist of it was this: 
We in the Senate can’t achieve civility 
without an ‘‘Alaskan of the Week’’ 
speech at the end of the week to lift 
spirits here in the Senate. 
I kind of appreciated that meme, so 
we wanted to make sure that we, after 
a rough, contentious couple of weeks, 
ended it on a note that was uplifting 
and to highlight another very special 
Alaskan, as I try to do pretty much 
every week, whose role right now in 
our country is, in fact, going to be 
about bringing civility and respect and 
emphasizing the importance of service 
to all people of the United States and 
across the globe. So I thought, what a 
great time for an ‘‘Alaskan of the 
Week’’ speech. I know the pages love it. 
So let me introduce to you our Alas-
kan of the week this week: 20-year-old 
Emma Broyles from Anchorage, who 
broke through barriers to become the 
first Alaskan and the first Korean 
American ever to be crowned Miss 
America. This just happened a couple 
weeks ago. Emma is very well-deserv-
ing, as you will see, and when it was 
announced that she had won Miss 
America, when that happened, when 
her name was announced, she cried 
tears of joy, of course, and Alaskans 
across the State cheered. 
Now, every Miss America contestant 
picks a cause to champion. Special 
Olympics, which I love—I am probably 
Alaska’s 
Special 
Olympics 
biggest 
fan—was Emma’s cause. 
The night of the event, they held a 
watch party at the Jim Balamici Spe-
cial Olympics training center in An-
chorage, which is a great facility. Our 
Special Olympian athletes were the 
loudest of any group in the State 
cheering for Emma and her great win. 
Then, of course, there is the huge, ex-
tended Korean-American family who 
was also cheering, laughing, and crying 
when it was announced that she had 
won. 
After it was done, Emma told report-
ers: ‘‘I didn’t even expect to make the 
top 10. I was there for the good time 
and the cheesecake.’’ That is Emma for 
you—funny, self-deprecating, humble, 
and real, just like her home State. She 
is the perfect Miss America to rep-
resent the great State of Alaska. 
So let me tell you about our Miss 
America, 
America’s 
Miss 
America, 
Alaska’s Miss America, and her goals 
going forward. 
About 50 years ago, Emma’s grand-
parents emigrated from Korea to An-
chorage. They wanted to raise a fam-
ily, to live the American dream. Alas-
ka, of course, is a great place to do 
that. 
By the way, we have the greatest, 
strongest, 
most 
incredible 
Korean- 
American community in Alaska, who 
are just incredible Americans. 
Emma’s 
grandparents’ 
daughter— 
Emma’s mom—Julie was born in An-
chorage, and so was her father Ron. 
Emma grew up a typical Alaskan kid— 
like my three daughters—fishing, win-
ter sports, hard work at school, com-
munity-oriented. Her mom was a spe-
cial education teacher, and her older 
brother has Down syndrome. 
Emma likes to say that she went to 
her first Special Olympics meet when 
she was in the womb, so she has been a 
fan literally from the beginning of her 
life, and that is one of the reasons she 
is so passionate about that issue. She 
knows firsthand, like many of us do, 
the power of Special Olympic athletes 
to inspire and to be such great rep-
resentatives for inclusion and respect 
and healthy competition. 
Emma graduated from Service High 
School and made her way to Arizona 
State University, where she is now a 
junior studying biomedical sciences 
and voice performance. She wants to be 
a doctor. In fact, she wants to be a der-
matologist. 
Emma shared something with the 
world during the Miss America pageant 
that was very brave, like so many 
young women are doing now, particu-
larly our athletes who have to perform 
and have a platform and use that plat-
form for good, to talk about some dif-
ficult issues. Emma told the world that 
she had been diagnosed with ADHD— 
attention deficit hyperactivity dis-
order—which led to chronic scratching 
and skin-pinching issues. 
Now, we don’t hear a lot about that, 
but roughly 2 percent of the population 
has 
this 
challenge, 
mostly 
young 
women. That is why Emma wants to be 
a dermatologist—to help young women 
like her who suffer from this disorder 
or other medical challenges. 
‘‘It was kind of a hard thing for me to 
share at first,’’ Emma said, with the 
world during the pageant. ‘‘I wasn’t 
sure if I was ready to be that vulner-
able, you know, on a national stage 
with hundreds [of] thousands of people 
watching.’’ 
That is what she said, but she did it. 
She did it. That was very courageous, 
and we are better for it. 
With Emma’s beautiful singing voice, 
her poise, her bravery in highlighting 
an issue that has caused her a lot of 
pain, her role of championing the Spe-
cial Olympics, her heritage, her home 
State, the crown looked very natural 
and beautiful atop Emma’s head, like 
it was meant to be there. 
Here is what she told a reporter after 
she won: 
There were a lot of people who felt like 
they saw themselves in me. 
She talked about all of the positive 
messages she had received from people 
all across America, Alaska, and the en-
tire world after she won. 
They told her how wonderful it was 
to see someone like them, someone 
who had similar issues or someone who 
has a family member who has a dis-
ability, and she talked about it coura-
geously. They told her how wonderful 
it was ‘‘seeing themselves in me and 
seeing this kind of relatable figure and 
someone they can look to.’’ That is 
Emma. 
I think you are starting to see what 
a great young woman she is. Like so 
many of us, she had a tough time dur-
ing COVID last year, but she overcame 
it. She said, ‘‘I hope that other people 
know that they can do the same 
thing,’’ overcoming these challenges, 
‘‘whatever it is they’re struggling 
with.’’ 
So thank you, Emma, for being such 
an inspiration—incredible job, incred-
ible courage, incredible poise. 
I also—because I am talking about 
Emma—want to recognize so many 
other incredible Alaska women who 
have recently stepped up, done amazing 
things. 
We have a State of very strong 
women. I am lucky to be surrounded by 
them everywhere—my wife, my daugh-
ters, cousins, sisters-in-law. 
There is a famous saying in our 
State, and when you come to Alaska, 
you see it everywhere—T-shirts, mugs, 
bumper stickers. It is a simple saying: 
Alaska girls kick ass. 
Now, look, I am not sure I am sup-
posed to be able to say that on the Sen-
ate floor, but I just did. I hope I am not 
going to get fined or anything. But 
take a look. It is everywhere in our 
State. I love the bumper stickers. 
And that, in the past year, has really 
proven to be true—truer than ever. We 
have our first Alaskan to win Miss 
America, our Alaskan of the Week 
today, Emma Broyles. We had our first

Alaskan, Lydia Jacoby, to win a gold 
medal in swimming, where we don’t 
even have an Olympic-size swimming 
pool. She won the breaststroke in an 
amazing race. She did such a great job 
that she is the first person in U.S. Sen-
ate history to be Alaskan of the Week 
twice—not sure that is ever going to 
happen again. 
We have the first Alaskan woman, 
Deniz Burnham, chosen to be a NASA 
astronaut. Another woman, Nichole 
Ayers, who was stationed at Elmendorf 
Air Force Base in Anchorage, was also 
picked to be an astronaut. 
I don’t know. It is something about

And, as usual, we have winter olym-

again this year, like we almost always 
do—strong, very strong, in that area: 
Rosie Brennan, Vicky Persinger. 
And there is Quannah Chasinghorse, 
an Alaskan Native—a young Alaskan 
Native woman who was featured re-
cently on the cover of Vogue. 
So it has been a great year for strong 
Alaskan women. And to Emma, I just 
want to say: You make us all proud. 
Congratulations 
on 
your 
incredible 
win: Miss America, first Alaskan ever. 
You have been an inspiration to us. 
Thank you for your courage, your will-

and take up great causes like our Spe-

congratulations on being our Alaskan

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Ohio. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, 10 
minutes ago there was a different Ne-
vadan Senator sitting at the Presiding 
Officer’s chair. Welcome. 
I was at a roundtable this morning 
with a group of Ohio county commis-
sioners from conservative counties like 
Warren and Medina and more progres-
sive counties like Lucas and Ham-
ilton—Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
alike; male, female; a good cross sec-
tion of Ohio leaders—talking about the 
projects we are going to build and the 
good-paying jobs we are going to cre-
ate—jobs that will not be off-shored 
this time because we came together to 
pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill. 
Yesterday, I was on a media call with 
the Republican mayor of Findlay, OH, 
about the I–75 bridge project that they 
need in Hancock County. 
The day before, I was at another 
roundtable with western Ohio leaders, 
talking with them about how we can 
leverage these investments. It is some 
of the most important work I am going 
to be doing over the coming months, 
working with local and Federal offi-
cials to make sure this investment 
translates into Ohio jobs. 
The Presiding Officer understands 
this, that we pass legislation here. 
With it, sometimes, comes a good bit of 
money, like with infrastructure. But it 
is also up to us, as representing our 
States, to make sure those dollars are 
spent efficiently and effectively and 
quickly, frankly. 
The infrastructure bill is some of the 
most important work we have done in 
the Senate in a long time. We are in-
vesting in our country. 
For years, mayors and businesses and 
workers have been telling us, as their 
representatives, 
as 
their 
Senators, 
about the need to upgrade infrastruc-
ture, but we have noticed over the 
years that candidates of both parties 
have promised infrastructure. ‘‘We are 
going to pass an infrastructure bill 
when I am elected,’’ they say. Plenty 
talk about it, but now, with a new 
President and a new majority in the 
Senate and the House, we are finally 
getting it done with this bipartisan in-
frastructure bill. 
Over the past few months, I have 
heard from communities about the 
projects that this is going to allow 
them to accomplish. 
In Toledo, with the mayor, talking 
about the city’s plans to replace lead 
pipes—my State has the dubious dis-
tinction of being the second leading 
State, if you will. Our State has the 
second-most lead-contaminated pipes 
from main water lines and the pipes 
going into people’s homes. We have 
600,000 pipes like that going into peo-
ple’s homes that have high levels of 
lead. 
And science has known, paint compa-
nies have known, lead manufacturers 
have known that infants, babies ingest 
lead. It affects their brain development 
for the rest of their lives. So one of our 
goals, working with the mayor of To-
ledo, is over the next several years to 
replace those pipes. 
Ohio will get someone $1 billion in 
new funding to improve water infra-
structure. 
The Western Hills Viaduct in Cin-
cinnati, the Patterson Avenue Bridge 
in Dayton—Ohio has some 3,200 bridges 
eligible for upgrades. Some of them, 
like the Brent Spence, unbelievably, 
across the Ohio River, carries 3 percent 
of GDP every day across that river. 
Some of those bridges are—when I 
grew up working the family farm, driv-
ing a tractor with a hay wagon cross-
ing little culvert bridges that dot our 
countryside and all over my State, 
many of those are in states of dis-
repair. 
We have seen the new pollution-free 
buses that communities like Akron and 
Canton, Columbus, and Lake County 
are rolling out through Laketran, their 
transit system. We have heard about 
how they are going to expand service 
so people can get to work and school. 
We have some 60,000 buses—big city 
buses—and another 50 or 60,000 small 
transit, more rural buses, that need to 
be replaced. They are fossil fuel, most-
ly diesel engines, and we are going to 
replace those over the next several 
years with low-emission or zero-emis-
sion buses. 
From the Port of Ashtabula, the 
community my wife grew up in, we are 
hearing about how upgrades to our 
ports will increase investment and help 
speed up and grow Ohio supply chains. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, this 
Congress, this Senate and the House, 
frankly, over the years, at the behest 
of corporate lobbyists, sold us out on 
trade agreements, sold us out on tax 
policy, so that so many jobs left our 
country. The industrial Midwest was 
hit the hardest, but every State was hit 
by that job loss because of bad govern-
ment policy, again, lobbied by some of 
the largest corporations in the world— 
the tech companies, the drug compa-
nies, the oil industry. 
We now have a President who wants 
to get it right and bring those supply 
chains closer to home. 
Now this, we also see how Ohio needs 
better rail infrastructure—new rail 
cars for Cleveland RTA, better Amtrak 
service, safer rail crossings. 
But, fundamentally, this bill—the in-
frastructure bill—is a jobs bill. It will 
create construction jobs, to be sure. It 
will 
create 
jobs—union 
jobs: 
car-
penters, 
millwrights, 
electricians, 
plumbers and pipe fitters, sheet metal 
workers, laborers. It will create those 
kinds of jobs but also create manufac-
turing jobs through the supply chain. 
Senator PORTMAN and I worked to 
make sure this bill has the strongest 
‘‘Buy America’’ requirements ever in 
an infrastructure bill with our Build 
America, Buy America Act. 
Every one of these projects will come 
with the strongest ever ‘‘Buy America’’ 
rules. No more bridges—no more bay 
bridges in Northern California—made 
entirely with Chinese steel. 
We introduced the ‘‘Build America, 
Buy 
America’’ 
bill 
on 
President 
Trump’s inauguration day. Unfortu-
nately, nothing moved because every-
thing got crowded out of President 
Trump’s agenda so they could give a 
huge tax cut to the richest people in 
the country. 
We worked with other leaders now, 4 
years later, with a new President, to 
get it right. 
With ‘‘Buy America’’ particularly, I 
call out Senator BALDWIN from Wis-
consin, Senator PETERS from Michigan 
and their work. 
We are putting in place a clear, per-
manent standard: If American tax dol-
lars are involved, American workers 
should be getting the jobs. It is going 
to mean more contracts for Ohio busi-
nesses. 
Cleveland Cliffs’ new plant in Toledo, 
talking about what we are doing there, 
it is the cleanest steel making, I be-
lieve, in the entire world at that new 
plant. 
Owens Corning in Toledo; Gradall In-
dustries in New Philadelphia, OH, on 
the edge of Appalachia. 
We have the potential for hundreds 
more bridge projects around the State 
using American rebar, American steel, 
American iron. 
It is an investment in Ohio that will 
pay off, creating jobs now, both during 
construction and up and down the sup-
ply chain. It will help attract new busi-
nesses. It will help keep the existing

ones. It will connect people with their 
jobs and businesses. 
I will spend pretty much every day, 
and my staff will too, making sure that 
our State gets its fair share of this in-
vestment and these jobs. 
If you believe in the dignity of work, 
you fight for the people who make this 
country work. We are seeing results. 
On Wednesday, the mayor of Findlay 
and I were talking about the Biden ad-
ministration’s announcement of $100 
million in initial bridge funding al-
ready on the way to Ohio. That focus 
will continue. 
We are doing roundtables. We are 
doing briefings with Federal officials, 
with local township trustees and coun-
ty officials and mayors and city offi-
cials and State officials, talking about 
how they can apply for Federal fund-
ing, and to make sure communities are 
best positioned to make the most of 
this infrastructure. 
Our goal is to leverage this invest-
ment to create jobs in every city, in 
every county, in every township across 
my great State. 
I yield the floor.

COVID–19 VACCINES 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as our 
Nation battles another wave of COVID– 
19, I want to detail my efforts to lower 
barriers for Americans to access life-
saving vaccinations against this ter-
rible disease. 
The Special Committee on Aging’s 
investigation forced the largest com-
mercial health insurer in the United 
States to reverse course and make 
whole providers who were paid far 
below the market rate for admin-
istering COVID–19 vaccines. These ef-
forts will help ensure that every pro-
vider who can administer COVID–19 
vaccines is doing so, helping get more 
shots in arms. 
Last year, news reports detailed how 
UnitedHealth had been shortchanging 
pediatricians who were vaccinating 
children against COVID–19. In short, 
Medicare set reimbursement rates for 
participating providers at $40 per dose 
in mid-March 2021. The Federal Gov-
ernment strongly recommended that 
private carriers do the same and most 
appear to have done so within weeks, 
but UnitedHealth did not. 
The committee’s investigation found 
that UnitedHealth paid in-network pro-
viders roughly 40 percent below the 
Medicare rate until July 1, 2021. Fur-
ther, the company delayed action to 
make providers whole. During the in-
vestigation, pediatricians in Pennsyl-
vania and beyond raised concerns that 
UnitedHealth’s original reimbursement 
rate could dissuade providers from ad-
ministering the vaccine. 
UnitedHealth covers 26 million peo-
ple in employer and individual market 
health insurance plans, with 1.4 million

in-network providers and an estimated 
14 
percent 
market 
share. 
UnitedHealth’s decision to reimburse 
providers below the Medicare rate had 
the potential to harm families across 
our Nation at a critical juncture, just 
as the Food and Drug Administration 
prepared to expand the availability of 
vaccines to children ages 5–11. 
For parents with questions about 
vaccines, pediatricians are trusted ad-
visers who can play a key role in over-
coming lingering concerns or hesi-
tancy, which remains a major issue in 
our Nation. 
In the long term, ensuring that all 
hands are on deck to deliver vaccines 
will help end this pandemic. Data has 
shown time and again that being vac-
cinated against COVID–19 reduces in-
fections, severe disease, hospitaliza-
tion, and death. Vaccinating children 
also will help protect adults by increas-
ing the number of Americans shielded 
from the virus, reducing its spread. It 
also reduces the chance for the virus to 
mutate and spawn variants, like Omi-
cron, that has led to another wave of 
illness and death. These concerns are 
particularly important for older adults 
who are more likely than the general 
population to experience both severe 
COVID–19 and breakthrough infections. 
Vaccinating 
children 
helps 
protect 
older generations, particularly older 
adults 
living 
in 
multigenerational 
households, including more than 7 mil-
lion grandparents who live with grand-
children under the age of 18. 
Providing more parents with the in-
formation they need to ensure they are 
comfortable vaccinating their kids will 
help protect all of our children. While 
pediatric hospitalizations remain rel-
atively rare, there has nonetheless 
been a significant increase of such hos-
pitalizations as the Omicron variant 
has spread in recent weeks. The Wall 
Street Journal recently reported that 
pediatric 
hospitalizations 
due 
to 
COVID–19 reached pandemic highs in 
the United States. 
Vaccinating more children is essen-
tial to keep schools open for in-person 
learning, 
a 
live 
issue 
for 
schools 
throughout our Nation that have been 
forced to return to online classes in the 
face of the Omicron variant. We must 
do all that we can to safely keep stu-
dents in the classroom so that they can 
receive 
the 
high-quality 
education 
they deserve. School closures also 
cause a disruption in the lives of fami-
lies, with parents often struggling to 
find childcare or forcing them to take 
time from work. Vaccinating children 
will help schools remain open, protect 
students and educators, and help par-
ents stay in the workforce. 
After Aging Committee investigators 
reached out to UnitedHealth, the com-
pany quickly and voluntarily com-
mitted to change course, commitments 
I detailed in an October 20, 2021, letter. 
In response to my letter, UnitedHealth 
confirmed its plans to retroactively in-
crease reimbursements for approxi-
mately 2 million COVID–19 vaccine ad-
ministration claims to the Medicare 
rate across its entire commercial net-
work, including individual plans on the 
Affordable Care Act marketplace. On 
January 14, 2022, the company reported 
that it had processed 1.64 million 
claims in connection with its commit-
ment to the committee—more than 99.8 
percent of the affected total—at an av-
erage cost of $14.55 per claim for a total 
of $23.9 million. The company expects 
the remaining claims, which number 
less than 2,900, to be processed by Feb-
ruary 1, 2022. 
UnitedHealth 
also 
committed 
to 
more quickly update reimbursement 
rates for future emergent vaccines and 
therapeutics, whether for COVID–19 or 
the next pandemic. The company added 
that it is ‘‘redirecting additional inter-
nal resources and automating updates 
whenever possible,’’ while noting that 
their new processes still might involve 
withholding claims ‘‘for a short time,’’ 
which it characterized as no longer 
than 30 days. On January 14, the com-
pany went further, stating that it will 
implement new billing codes in a na-
tional public health emergency ‘‘faster 
than industry standard,’’ while noting 
that it has ‘‘learned over the past few 
months the required technology and 
human resources that need to be 
brought forward to accelerate’’ adop-
tion of new billing codes in a public 
health emergency. 
While lacking some details, the steps 
UnitedHealth has described appear to 
be an appropriate response. However, 
UnitedHealth has not adequately ad-
dressed an issue that a senior company 
official raised when speaking with 
Aging Committee investigators in Sep-
tember, that the company’s size and 
numerous claims systems presented a 
barrier to quickly updating COVID–19 
vaccine reimbursement rates in the 
first place. In its responses to subse-
quent questions about the issue from 
committee 
staff, 
UnitedHealth 
has 
cited reasons such as contracting lan-
guage for the delay, but has failed to 
provide additional information or ex-
planation in their written responses. 
The fact that a senior UnitedHealth of-
ficial told the committee that the com-
pany’s size negatively affected the 
quality and efficiency of its inter-
actions with the market is concerning 
and a matter that deserves continued 
oversight from Congress and regu-
lators. 
In recent weeks, the world has been 
upended by the Omicron variant. Case 
rates have skyrocketed, and hospitals 
are once again filling up, primarily 
with people who have not gotten a 
COVID–19 vaccine or booster. In order 
to leave the tragedy, the disruptions 
and the closures of the pandemic be-
hind, every person who can be vac-
cinated has a duty to the country to 
roll up their sleeves and get the shot. 
We will continue to learn more about 
the Omicron variant and variants to 
come. However, there is one thing 
about this variant, past variants, and 
future variants that will not change: 
The key to ending this pandemic is get-
ting more people vaccinated. 
I remain committed to removing fu-
ture roadblocks that may emerge to 
widespread 
vaccination 
against 
COVID–19. 
This body should do the same. 
In closing, I ask unanimous consent 
to have printed in the RECORD the fol-
lowing documents: a September 3, 2021 
Modern Healthcare article detailing 
UnitedHealth’s under reimbursement 
for COVID–19 vaccines compared to 
most other major carriers; my October

sponse to my letter; a November 12,

further updates. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

UNITEDHEALTHCARE PAYS PROVIDERS BELOW 
STANDARD RATES FOR COVID–19 VACCINES 
(By Nona Tepper) 
Pediatricians across the country are claim-
ing the nation’s largest insurer is short-
changing them for administering COVID–19 
vaccines, jeopardizing access to the main 
tool for stopping the virus’ spread. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics has 
fielded complaints from providers nation-
wide who are frustrated that UnitedHealth 
Group is paying about 50% of the federal rate 
for vaccine administration, said Dr. Sue 
Kressly, who chairs the AAP’s payment ad-
vocacy advisory committee and runs Penn-
sylvania-based 
Kressly 
Pediatrics. 
While 
UnitedHealthcare is not legally required to 
pay the federal rate, Kressly said the 
Minnetonka, Minnesota-based insurer is the 
only national carrier that has not agreed to 
pay at least $40 for vaccine administration. 
The insurer also continues to pay pediatri-
cians and family medicine providers below- 
market rates for COVID–19 tests, Kressly 
said, an issue the New York Times revealed 
in February. 
With new variants of COVID–19 continuing 
to emerge, Kressly worried that low fees for 
testing and vaccine administration would 
lead some doctors to stop offering these serv-
ices, worsening the public health crisis, in-
creasing medical costs and inspiring more 
independent practices to shutter, particu-
larly as providers struggle with overwork 
during the pandemic. 
‘‘They had record-breaking profits in 2020, 
and we struggled with getting them to pay 
adequately for COVID testing. That still not 
been resolved,’’ Kressly said. ‘‘Now pediatri-
cians who are giving the vaccine to people 
covered by UnitedHealthcare, they’re effec-
tively opening their wallet, and subsidizing 
that patient to get the vaccine.’’ 
At the end of the company’s most recent 
second quarter on June 30, UnitedHealthcare 
generated $55.5 billion in revenue, up 13% 
from the $49.1 billion reported during the 
same period last year. The company counted 
more than 49.6 million enrollees, an increase 
of 1.2 million year-over-year. Meanwhile, the 
insurer’s low vaccine reimbursement rates 
threaten the future of family practices, 
Kressly said. Unlike most medical services, 
federal legislation bars providers from bal-
ance billing patients for the COV[0–19 vac-
cine. 
‘‘If we don’t at least make enough money 
to cover our costs, then we won’t be here as 
practices to serve the community beyond the

public health emergency,’’ Kressly said. 
‘‘That’s a bigger problem.’’ 
UnitedHealthcare is not the only payer of-
fering clinicians low fees for vaccine admin-
istration—some regional plans and employ-
ers are also paying below the federal rate, 
Kressly said. But she said these payers are 
likely just slow to react to payment stand-
ards. In March, the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services nearly doubled what it 
was paying providers for giving the vaccine, 
after the American Medical Association 
found the previous rate did not cover the 
costs associated with administering the shot. 
Most of these payers are just confused about 
the update and, when Kressly reaches out to 
them, she said they generally immediately 
increase their rate. But UnitedHealthcare 
has refused to increase what it is paying pe-
diatricians. 
‘‘They say, ‘Our fee schedule is our fee 
schedule, it’s up to the contract that the 
practice has with UnitedHealthcare, let 
them try to have the conversation,’ ’’ Kressly 
said. 
UnitedHealthcare, for its part, said it re-
cently offered to increase reimbursement for 
COVID–19 testing for some pediatric and 
family medicine practices that met specific 
criteria. 
When 
it 
comes 
to 
vaccines, 
UnitedHealthcare said it is continually re-
viewing its reimbursement rates. 
Dr. George Rogu, president of the Inde-
pendent Pediatric Collaborative of Long Is-
land and head of RBK Pediatrics, hopes to be 
one of the providers paid more for giving 
UnitedHealthcare enrollees COVID–19 vac-
cines. 
When Rogu reached out to the insurer last 
month. a UnitedHealthcare customer service 
representative blamed his low rates on his 
different customers’ plans and the different 
fee schedules associated with each. The cus-
tomer service representative said Rogu was 
the first provider to complain about the mat-
ter and offered to refer his case to the com-
pany’s management team. 
‘‘We cannot in good conscience say, ‘Oh, we 
can’t give you the vaccine because you have 
UnitedHealthcare.’ That’s not right,’’ Rogu 
said. ‘‘It’s just not humanely right. But peo-
ple 
that 
have 
a 
large 
panel 
of 
UnitedHealthcare customers? It’s killing 
them.’’ 
Rogu said he is still waiting to hear back 
from the insurer. 
He said he noticed that he was being paid 
below the federal rates in May and asked 
New York-based Canid Vaccines, his vaccine 
administration software system, about the 
problem. 
The 
startup 
verified 
that 
UnitedHealthcare reimbursed him at about 
half the rate that other insurers did. Canid 
Vaccines said it has identified at least 25 
independent 
practices 
representing 
more 
than 
350 
providers 
nationwide 
that 
UnitedHealthcare is paying at less than the 
federal rate. 
Among pediatric circles, UnitedHealthcare 
is often referred to as the ‘‘evil empire’’ 
since they are the least transparent and 
least cooperative among the major insurers, 
said Dr. Peter Pogacar, vice president of the 
Rhode Island chapter of the AAP and a pedi-
atrician at East Greenwich Pediatrics. He 
said UnitedHealthcare is underpaying physi-
cians for COVID–19 vaccine administration 
there too. 
‘‘Healthcare should be about healing with 
business as a sideshow, not the main event,’’ 
Pogacar wrote in an email. 
The insurer isn’t just offering low rates for 
administering 
the 
COVID–19 
vaccine. 
UnitedHealthcare has also reimbursed pro-
viders for less than what it cost them to pur-
chase COVID–19 testing kits. After signifi-
cant media attention, the manufacturer and 
distributor of the tests dropped their prices 
so that providers were no longer losing 
money 
when 
they 
were 
paid 
UnitedHealthcare rates, said Dr. Reshma 
Chugani, a pediatrician at the Atlanta Chil-
dren’s Clinical Center. The insurer also an-
nounced it would increase the rate paid for 
the tests, as well as allow pediatricians to 
resubmit patient claims, she said. But they 
are still not offering to reimburse providers 
for tests previously paid at below-market 
rates. 
‘‘We lost money on every United patient,’’ 
Chugani said. 
Additionally, the insurer has made it dif-
ficult for providers to recoup the money it 
said it owes them, forcing them to go 
through multiple administrative layers and 
still failing to reimburse one type of test at 
the full rate, said AAP’s Kressly. She said 
she talked to UnitedHealthcare about this 
issue two weeks ago and that it has still not 
been resolved. 
‘‘They’ve put barriers for us to have to act 
when we have no time, energy or resources 
to do so,’’ she said. 
OCTOBER 20, 2021. 
Sir ANDREW WITTY, 
Chief Executive Officer, 
UnitedHealth Group. 
DEAR SIR ANDREW: I write in regard to 
commitments 
UnitedHealth 
Group 
(UnitedHealth) made to the U.S. Senate Spe-
cial Committee on Aging related to reim-
bursement policies for the administration of 
COVID–19 vaccines. UnitedHealth’s past poli-
cies appeared to have created access barriers 
for children seeking COVID–19 vaccination 
from their primary care pediatrician—bar-
riers that affected younger and older Ameri-
cans alike. I appreciate the company’s deci-
sion to reprocess certain COVID–19 vaccine 
claims, which I expect will facilitate the 
broadest possible access to COVID–19 vac-
cines among UnitedHealth’s members. I ex-
pect that the steps UnitedHealth has com-
mitted to take will help children seeking 
COVID–19 vaccines as well as older Ameri-
cans under the purview of the Aging Com-
mittee, including the millions who live with 
and care for their grandchildren or other 
younger relatives. I appreciate your com-
pany’s assurance that UnitedHealth will 
keep the Aging Committee updated on its 
progress toward expeditiously resolving the 
concerns raised with the company. 
The Aging Committee’s attention was 
drawn to this issue by press reports high-
lighting that during a four-month period ear-
lier this year, UnitedHealth reimbursed pedi-
atricians at rates that failed to meet the 
costs of administering COVID–19 vaccines. 
During that time, other large insurers re-
portedly reimbursed pediatricians and other 
health care providers at a higher rate, in line 
with what the Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services (CMS) set in March 2021. Pedi-
atricians 
raised 
concerns 
that 
UnitedHealth’s 
low 
reimbursement 
rates 
would deter in-network providers from ad-
ministering 
COVID–19 
vaccines, 
creating 
barriers for patients. The additional costs of 
administering COVID–19 vaccines have been 
significant for providers, a point that CMS 
noted at the time it increased reimburse-
ment rates, citing ‘‘updated information 
about the costs involved in administering 
the COVID–19 vaccine for different types of 
providers and suppliers and the additional 
resources you need to safely and appro-
priately administer the vaccine.’’ The agen-
cy furthermore encouraged private payers to 
follow suit, noting that ‘‘in light of CMS’s 
increased Medicare payment rates, CMS will 
expect commercial carriers to continue to 
ensure that their rates are reasonable in 
comparison to prevailing market rates.’’ 
Given UnitedHealth’s status as the Nation’s 
largest commercial payer—with 26 million 
people enrolled in employer and individual 
plans, 1.4 million in-network providers and 
an estimated 14 percent market share—it is 
critical that the company do all it can to en-
sure that vaccines are available to every per-
son that is eligible to receive one. To that 
end, the Aging Committee requested that 
UnitedHealth provide information about the 
company’s reimbursement rates, the timeli-
ness of future fee schedule updates and the 
company’s progress toward making providers 
whole for vaccines they administered while 
UnitedHealth was reimbursing below reim-
bursement rates set by CMS. 
The ongoing effort to increase COVID–19 
vaccination rates across our Nation demands 
an all-hands-on-deck approach. Ensuring 
that all eligible children are vaccinated 
against COVID–19 is key to improving the 
overall vaccination rate, which will better 
protect older Americans by helping stem the 
spread of the virus. Such efforts are of par-
ticular importance ahead of the Food and 
Drug Administration’s (FDA) expected con-
sideration of COVID–19 vaccines for young 
children later this month. Older Americans 
have been among those hit hardest by 
COVID–19 and face the greatest health risks 
if they contract the disease, even after being 
vaccinated. Recognizing the elevated risk of 
breakthrough infections in older adults, the 
Biden administration recently authorized 
third doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 
for people ages 65 and over. The serious 
health risks COVID–19 poses for older adults 
are especially acute for those living in 
multi-generation households, including more 
than 7 million grandparents who live with 
grandchildren under the age of 18. Those 
older Americans are at even greater risk of 
exposure when they live with unvaccinated 
individuals, 
an 
important 
consideration 
given the greater impact of the delta variant 
on children. The current wave of COVID–19 
has led to higher pediatric case rates, record 
pediatric hospitalizations and school clo-
sures that have affected more than 900,000 
students at 1,800 schools across 44 states in 
August and September alone. 
During calls in September with Aging 
Committee staff, UnitedHealth officials con-
firmed 
press 
accounts 
that 
reported 
a 
months-long period when the company was 
reimbursing providers up to 40 percent less 
for COVID–19 vaccine administration than 
the rate set by the CMS. While other major 
payers reportedly adopted the reimburse-
ment rate set by CMS swiftly, UnitedHealth 
continued reimbursing at a lower rate until 
the end of June. During conversations with 
staff, UnitedHealth reported that it had 
problems uploading the CMS rate to the 
company’s various fee schedules. Aging Com-
mittee staff have heard concerns from pro-
viders that the reimbursement issues pedia-
tricians experienced with UnitedHealth ear-
lier this year could resurface when the FDA 
authorizes a COVID–19 vaccine for 5–11 year- 
olds, which will carry a different billing 
code. 
Following the concerns raised by the Aging 
Committee last month, UnitedHealth in-
formed Aging Committee staff during a call 
on October 6 that the company planned to 
address the concerns outlined above. Specifi-
cally, UnitedHealth committed to reprocess-
ing all of its commercial claims—not just pe-
diatric claims—from the time CMS issued 
new rates for COVID–19 vaccines in mid- 
March to the time United updated its fee 
schedule on July 1. Company officials further 
stated that United Health would reprocess 
the claims automatically and that providers 
would not be required to resubmit claims for 
reprocessing. Noting that the company ex-
pected to reprocess ‘‘millions’’ of claims that

were submitted by providers during the 
three-and-a-half month period prior to July 
1, UnitedHealth officials told Aging Com-
mittee staff that they hoped to make ‘‘sig-
nificant progress’’ within 30–45 days. Com-
pany officials further committed to: 
1. Review UnitedHealth’s claims process to 
minimize delays in making payments to pro-
viders for COVID–19 vaccines; 
2. Verify that there are no similar under-
payment issues in its Affordable Care Act 
Exchange and Medicaid Managed Care books 
of business: and 
3. Provide updates to Aging Committee 
staff on the company’s progress toward 
meeting these goals. 
As part of these updates, please also pro-
vide me with the following information no 
later than November 5, 2021: 
1. How many claims does UnitedHealth ex-
pect to reprocess for COVID–19 vaccinations 
that were administered prior to July 1, 2021? 
What was the average difference between the 
initial reimbursement and the reprocessed 
claim? What was the total amount that 
UnitedHealth paid to providers to settle 
these claims at the CMS rates? 
2. UnitedHealth told Aging Committee 
staff that it is difficult to quickly update its 
reimbursement rates when new vaccine bill-
ing codes and rates are issued by CMS. 
UnitedHealth further stated that its ex-
pected solution for this issue may involve de-
laying payments to providers to give the 
company’s payment systems time to reflect 
new codes and rates. In order to minimize ac-
cess delays in the future, what steps is 
UnitedHealth taking to ensure that pediatri-
cians and other providers will be reimbursed 
in a timely manner when CMS issues new 
rates for COVID–19 vaccines or other emer-
gent vaccines and therapeutics in the future? 
Thank you for your attention to this im-
portant issue. If you or your staff has ques-
tions, please contact Peter Gartrell, Chief 
Investigator for Chairman Casey.

Chairman BOB CASEY, 
U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
CASEY: 
On 
behalf 
of 
UnitedHealth Group, including our over 
120,000 frontline doctors, nurses, and other 
health care practitioners, thank you for your 
recent letter regarding retroactive payment 
for COVID–19 vaccine administration. Like 
many individuals and families, clinicians 
and essential health workers have sacrificed 
deeply these past two years as our country 
worked together to fight COVID–19. 
We share your commitment to ensuring 
and expanding access to critically important 
health care services and understand these 
are extraordinarily challenging times for the 
millions of people we are privileged to serve, 
as well as employers, health care providers, 
governments, and the health care system. 
We welcome this opportunity to provide you 
with an overview of the significant actions 
we have voluntarily taken regarding vaccine 
reimbursement and the steps we are taking 
to quickly address the concerns expressed. 
UnitedHealth Group is committed to help-
ing people live healthier lives and making 
the health care system work better for ev-
eryone. We do this by working with stake-
holders and partners to address the biggest 
challenges facing our system. As we shared 
during our conversation, we have been in 
close contact with the American Academy of 
Pediatrics regarding concerns they raised 
about vaccine reimbursement. 
Consistent with the discussion with your 
staff on October 6th and your October 21st 
letter, we are writing to confirm the fol-
lowing details related to our reimbursement 
for COVID–19 vaccine administration: 
UnitedHealthcare (UHC) has been reim-
bursing providers using the new CMS rates 
since July 1, 2021, consistent with timing 
specified in UHC’s contracts with providers. 
UHC will adjust claims paid less than $40 
between March 15 and June 30, 2021 to reim-
burse at $40 per administration, so providers 
can benefit from the increase CMS an-
nounced on March 15, 2021. 
The voluntary retroactive reimbursement 
changes are in process and claims will be ad-
justed accordingly. Providers will not need 
to take action to receive the change in reim-
bursement. 
UnitedHealth Group recognizes the impor-
tant role that reimbursement plays in ad-
dressing the COVID–19 pandemic, which is 
why we are taking action to adjust previous 
claims and accelerating our processes to up-
date reimbursement rates when changes are 
announced by CMS. In your letter dated Oc-
tober 21, 2021, you asked for the following in-
formation: 
The number of COVID–19 vaccine adminis-
tration claims UHC expects to reprocess. 
The average difference between the initial 
reimbursement and the reprocessed claim. 
The total amount that will be reimbursed. 
Information on how we will ensure pro-
viders will be reimbursed in a timely manner 
when CMS issues new rates for COVID–19 
vaccine claims going forward. 
Approximately two million COVID–19 vac-
cine administration claims paid between 
March 15 and June 30, 2021 will be impacted 
by this retroactive adjustment. We antici-
pate the average adjustment will be approxi-
mately $12.50 per claim, for total additional 
reimbursement of approximately $25 million. 
UHC has already begun processing these re-
imbursements. 
With regard to new rates for COVID–19 vac-
cinations or other emergent therapeutics for 
COVID–19, we will be accelerating our proc-
ess for updating our reimbursement to sup-
port the COVID–19 vaccine codes and rates 
implemented by CMS as they become avail-
able. Specifically, UHC will implement new 
COVID–19 codes and rates upon the publica-
tion of this information by CMS rather than 
including these changes in our scheduled 
quarterly reimbursement update processes. 
This will ensure provider payments are up-
dated as quickly as possible. 
We appreciate the services provided by 
health care professionals during the pan-
demic. The actions we are taking to adjust 
COVID–19 vaccine claims build on the many 
steps we have taken to support providers 
over the last eighteen months, including ac-
celerating claims payments, assisting in 
processing and administering CARES Act 
Federal funding to providers, working with 
HHS to ensure clinicians who provided 
COVID–19 testing or treatment for individ-
uals without insurance were reimbursed for 
their services, and removing administrative 
requirements in highly impacted areas. 
We appreciate the opportunity to address 
the Committee’s questions. 
Sincerely, 
BRIAN THOMPSON, 
CEO, UnitedHealthcare. 
NOVEMBER 12. 2021. 
Addendum to UHG—Senate Aging Com-
mittee Response on 11/5/21 
Thank you for the email of November 8, 
2021 with follow-up questions to UHG’s letter 
dated 11/5/2021, and for your continued en-
gagement regarding how we reimburse pro-
viders for COVID–19 vaccine administration. 
Please see our additional responses below: 
Staff asked that we clarify whether ‘‘simi-
lar underpayment issues occurred in United’s 
Affordable Care Act and Medicaid Managed 
Care plans.’’ 
Answer: As discussed with staff, we have 
been paying providers according to their con-
tracts since the vaccines first became avail-
able. These provider contracts explicitly pro-
vide how new procedure codes are imple-
mented and on what timeline; those provi-
sions are agreed to by all parties. Because 
United paid its network providers according 
to these contracts, there have been no ‘‘un-
derpayments.’’ Nevertheless, after reviewing 
concerns about the contracted reimburse-
ment amounts paid earlier this year, we 
elected to voluntarily increase reimburse-
ment—above and beyond contractual rates— 
for all commercial plans (including indi-
vidual plans purchased via ACA exchanges), 
for dates of service between March 15, 2021 
and June 30, 2021. 
Within ACA Exchanges, we similarly have 
paid according to contracts agreed to with 
providers. ACA Exchange plans will be in-
cluded in the voluntary increase in reim-
bursement described above. The completion 
of that increase will be on the same time 
frame as commercial plans. With respect to 
managed Medicaid, as we noted in our first 
discussion with staff on September 22, 2021, 
those plans pay according to rates set by 
state law and state payment policies. United 
has paid for vaccine administration con-
sistent with those parameters and will con-
tinue to do so. 
Staff asked that we provide detail about 
how we will timely reimburse providers for 
emergent vaccines and therapeutics unre-
lated to COVID–19 and the current Public 
Health Emergency (PHE). 
Answer: In the event of a future pandemic 
or new PHE we will take immediate actions 
(noted below) to accelerate reimbursement 
updates. Outside of a pandemic or PHE how 
we update codes and payment rates will con-
tinue to be guided by our existing contracts 
with providers. Consistent with industry 
practice, those contracts provide for timely 
and substantial payment to providers while 
we complete the update to our systems. At 
all times we will follow all applicable state 
and federal requirements. 
Staff noted the complexity of adjusting re-
imbursement rates for new procedure codes 
and asked for details on how United might 
make those adjustments more quickly in the 
future. 
Answer: We hope that under less exigent 
circumstances CMS will provide additional 
lead time for its pronouncements, but United 
is not relying on that to speed its processes 
during this PHE. Instead, we are devoting 
significant time and effort to ensuring that 
the process of updating new COVID–19-re-
lated codes within our systems begins at the 
time of publication of those codes and with-
out regard to contractual timelines. This in-
cludes, for example, redirecting additional 
internal resources and automating updates 
whenever possible. While some claims filed 
immediately after new payment codes are 
announced might be held for a short time 
while those updates are being made (gen-
erally no longer than 30 days after receipt), 
we believe this will result in overall faster 
reimbursement at updated rates. Indeed, it is 
common in the industry to hold claims dur-
ing a period of change or uncertainty to help 
ensure that those claims are paid accurately. 
We are confident we will be able to update 
new codes for all claims platforms on a time-
ly basis. 
Finally, staff asked for updates as to our 
progress on increasing the reimbursement 
amount for the approximately two million 
claims impacted by our decision to volun-
tarily increase reimbursement for COVID–19 
vaccine administration. 
Answer: To date, we have resolved approxi-
mately 60% of these claims. We expect the

UnitedHealthcare’s Response 
Date: Friday, January 14, 2022 5:12:29 PM 
Peter, thank you for your recent email, in 
which you asked for an update on our vol-
untary efforts to retroactively increase re-
imbursement to $40 for COVID–19 vaccine ad-
ministration. Answers to your questions are 
provided below; however, we expect that this 
confidential information will not be shared 
with third parties. 
To date, we have retroactively reimbursed 
providers for 1,640,996 claims, or more than 
99.8% of all affected claims. The average ad-
ditional payment for those claims was $14.55, 
for a total of approximately $23.9 million in 
additional payments. At this time, fewer 
than 2,900 claims (less than 0.2% percent of 
all affected claims) remain to be reprocessed. 
Because the original paid amount on those 
remaining claims averaged about $36, the av-
erage additional reimbursement to be paid 
will be about $4. Those remaining reimburse-
ments continue to be prioritized and sent out 
the door. We anticipate those few remaining 
claims will be completed by February 1, 2022. 
We note that you asked for claims and pay-
ment data by state. There are a few reasons 
we are not able to cut this data cleanly by 
state, including that providers submit claims 
via tax identification numbers (TIN), many 
of which cover physicians (and therefore 
claims) from multiple states. 
You also asked for additional information 
about how we will shorten the adoption time 
of new rates in this or a future national pub-
lic health emergency (NPHE). As we stated 
previously, contracts between United and its 
network provider groups specifically provide 
for time to implement new rates in an or-
derly way. We understand this to be routine 
across the industry, understood and long ac-
cepted by the provider community, and en-
tirely proper. If there is another NPHE or 
there are exceptional circumstances which 
dictate more timely adoption of new rates, 
we have learned over the past few months 
the required technology and human re-
sources that need to be brought forward to 
accelerate. As a point of reference, should 
circumstances justify it, we commit to im-
plement new codes in an NPHE faster than 
industry standard.

MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
often hear from people in Wyoming 
who are concerned about the changes 
being proposed in Washington, DC. 
When the Federal Government changes 
the rules, authorities, or standards, it 
can significantly impact critical Wyo-
ming industries. 
In the ‘‘Wyoming Livestock Round-
up,’’ a weekly news source for Wyo-
ming’s ranchers, farmers, and Agri-
business community, Sarah L. Falen 
authored an opinion editorial titled 
‘‘The Government’s Word: Should We 
Trust It.’’ 
She raises concerns about the Biden 
administration’s 
rule 
revoking 
the 
Trump administration policy prohib-
iting 
prosecution 
for 
accidentally 
harming migratory birds under the Mi-
gratory Bird Treaty Act. While there 
has been a lot of discussion about the 
impact on the energy industries, Sarah 
Falen points out how the new rule 
could affect the agriculture industry. 
It is important that Congress note 
these consequences and the uncer-
tainty created by the Biden adminis-
tration’s rule. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
opinion editorial written by Sarah L. 
Falen. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
THE GOVERNMENT’S WORD: SHOULD WE TRUST 
IT? 
(By Sarah L. Fallen) 
Americans trust the U.S. government less 
and less. In fact, according to the Edelman 
Trust Barometer, trust in the federal govern-
ment hovers around 40%. Yet, with the rev-
ocation of the Trump Administration’s rule 
that prohibits prosecution for accidentally 
harming migratory birds under the Migra-
tory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), the Biden Ad-
ministration is asking citizens to do just 
that, ‘‘trust’’ the federal government. 
People involved in industries such as en-
ergy or agriculture have a clear under-
standing of how environmental legislation, 
originally passed with the best intention, 
has been weaponized to negatively affect 
their livelihoods. One of the lesser known, 
but just as dangerous environmental swords 
is the MBTA. While it is easy to see that en-
ergy industries, such as oil and gas, wind or 
even solar would be impacted by the Biden 
decision, this Act has the potential for very 
serious impacts on the agriculture industry. 
The MBTA is a statute that allows for the 
criminal prosecution of any person who ‘‘in-
cidentally takes’’ a migratory bird. To un-
derstand the breath of this Act, there are 
two important concepts. First, nearly all 
birds in the U.S. are considered migratory. 
Second, what constitutes an ‘‘incidental 
take.’’ The MBTA states that ‘‘it [is] unlaw-
ful at any time, . . . to pursue, hunt, take, 
capture, kill, . . . any migratory bird . . .’’ 
16 U.S.C. 703(a). If you read that language, it 
would make sense that this Act is referring 
to someone who intends to kill a migratory 
bird. That commonsense reading is what the 
Trump MBTA rule enforced . . . only those 
engaged in an action that purposefully 
‘‘takes’’ a migratory bird would be subject to 
fines and prison time. This is not how the 
Biden Administration reads that language. 
According to the Biden Administration, 
even if a person is doing something that ac-
cidentally harms a migratory bird, that per-
son can still be criminally liable. Thus, 
someone can be prosecuted for an action or 
inaction that is otherwise legal, but just so 
happens to ‘‘take’’ a migratory bird. 
We should all be concerned about the Biden 
Administration allowing ‘‘incidental take’’ 
to be prosecuted because there is no limit on 
what can be prosecuted. This means that if a 
farmer uses a pesticide that is legally admin-
istered and a migratory bird just so happens 
to ingest that pesticide, he could be subject 
to criminal prosecution. The MBTA allows 
for up to a $5,000 fine or six months in prison 
for an incidental take. 
The scenarios under which a person can ac-
cidentally kill a migratory bird are infinite 
and can be ridiculous. Yet, the government 
expects us to believe that they will only 
prosecute ‘‘foreseeable’’ accidental killings 
of migratory birds. It is foreseeable that a 
bird can ingest a legally administered pes-
ticide. Are farmers now risking prison time 
for growing the food that feeds America and 
the world? 
The Biden Administration has entertained 
the idea of an ‘‘incidental take permit’’ that 
might remove some of the liability for birds 
that are accidentally killed, however they 
have not developed the idea enough to know 
what the permit would look like. There 
aren’t any standards for what actions would 
be exempt from liability under the permit 
system and the MBTA office doesn’t have 
enough staff to begin handling the undoubt-
edly thousands of permit applications they 
will receive. 
The government has often implemented 
rules, promising it will not take advantage 
of its authority, but time after time this has 
proven to be just a way to get a rule ap-
proved or legislation passed. From wolves 
and grizzly bears to ever changing defini-
tions of ‘‘navigable waters,’’ the government 
has proven that its word should not be trust-
ed and the MBTA is no exception.

PUBLIC SERVICE REVIEW 
Mr. WICKER. For all who are looking 
for encouragement about the future of 
our country, I want to call attention to 
the Fall 2021 issue of ‘‘Public Service 
Review,’’ produced by the Stennis Cen-
ter for Public Service and available at 
www.stennis.gov. ‘‘Public Service Re-
view’’ features rising young leaders 
across the country sharing their own 
experiences, insights, and aspirations 
as they engage in public service, both 
in their communities and around the 
world. The commitment of these future 
leaders to keeping our Nation strong 
and free is truly inspiring. 
The eight authors featured in the fall 
2021 issue are Alexis Eberlein of Ohio 
University, Sarah Glaser of the Univer-
sity 
of 
South 
Florida, 
Hannah 
Krawczyk of Auburn University, Mia 
Robertson of Mississippi State Univer-
sity, Alanna Cronk of Georgetown Uni-
versity, Katie Medford of Harvard Uni-
versity, Preeti Chemiti of Princeton 
University, and Amitoj Kaur of Miami 
University. 
‘‘Public Service Review’’ provides 
young leaders a platform to share sto-
ries of both challenge and hope as they 
focus on causes that draw their unique 
passions. Their stories are hopegiving 
to those of us currently engaged in 
public service and offer valuable per-
spectives for younger students looking 
to become involved. 
On behalf of my colleagues and fellow 
members of the Stennis Center Board 
of Trustees, U.S. Senator CHRIS COONS, 
Tom 
Daffron, 
U.S. 
Representative 
TERRI SEWELL, and former U.S. Rep-
resentatives Martha Roby and Gregg 
Harper, I commend the Stennis Center 
for this excellent publication and en-
courage its wide distribution to audi-
ences of all ages.

January 20, 2022 
Linda earned a degree from Univer-
sity of Arizona in 1980 before embark-
ing on a career dedicated to public 
service. Linda began her service as a 
congressional staffer for Representa-
tive Millicent Fenwick from her home 
State of New Jersey. She then served 
the people of Illinois as a legislative 
aide for Representative Bob Michel. In 
1989, Linda began her service at the 
U.S. Department of Education, engag-
ing with State and local officials and 
congressional offices in both the Inter-
governmental Affairs Office and the Of-
fice of Legislation and Congressional 
Affairs, serving 9 of the 12 U.S. Secre-
taries of Education across political 
parties. 
Linda has been an indispensable re-
source in my work on the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee and the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee, of which I am 
a member. She assisted me to solve in-
numerable problems and concerns im-
portant to my constituents. She pro-
vided information about various ad-
ministrations’ implementation of im-
portant Federal programs, such as the 
Alaska Native Educational Equity Pro-
gram, the Native American Language 
program, the State-Tribal Education 
Partnership program, and Impact Aid, 
in addition to providing insight into 
the Department’s budget priorities. In 
addition to her expertise on these 
issues, she always approached my ques-
tions and concerns with the utmost 
diligence and attention, providing the 
support necessary for me to craft legis-
lation that meets the needs of my con-
stituents and the American people. 
I am grateful for Linda’s profes-
sionalism and dedication. I thank her 
and congratulate her on her upcoming 
retirement and wish her well in the fu-

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, on 
Monday, our Nation celebrated the life 
and legacy of Rev. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Like many Americans, it was a day 
of self-reflection for me. While leading 
a bipartisan delegation to Ukraine, I 
had a front-row seat to a nation strug-
gling to hold on to its democracy in 
the face of a potential outside attack. 
This comes at a very poignant moment 
in America’s history when we were re-
minded of the strength and fragility of 
our own democracy. 
One year ago, a violent mob fueled by 
false claims of widespread election 
fraud stormed the U.S. Capitol. This 
was the most significant assault on the 
Capitol since the War of 1812. Although 
State and Federal judges ruled against 
efforts to overturn the results of the 
election, this lie of election fraud has 
continued to propagate. And now, 
those who didn’t like the 2020 election 
results are trying to rewrite the rules. 
Since the 2020 elections, Republican 
State lawmakers have passed an un-
precedented number of bills to erode 
the authority of state and local elec-
tion officials. These new laws would 
strip secretaries of state of their au-
thority, allow partisan ballot reviews, 
and even make local election officials 
criminally or financially liable for 
technical errors and actions, such as 
proactively sending out absentee ballot 
applications. 
In total, 19 States have passed regres-
sive laws that make it harder to vote 
and, in some extreme cases, may even 
allow 
Republican-controlled 
legisla-
tures to overturn the results of a le-
gitimate election by using false claims 
of voter fraud. In New Hampshire, over 
the past year, we have seen efforts to 
eliminate same-day voter registration, 
a measure that would disproportion-
ately impact young voters, including 
college students and first-time voters. 
Similarly, other efforts to prohibit 
students attending college in New 
Hampshire from voting in our State’s 
elections would unduly burden—if not 
outright disenfranchise—many of those 
young voters. Other attempts to make 
voter registration more complicated 
have failed in court, including require-
ments for additional documentation 
for same-day registrants, and restric-
tions on which types of addresses are 
valid for registration. 
These efforts are ongoing, with addi-
tional 
restrictive 
and 
burdensome 
measures being introduced as recently 
as the current legislative session. And 
it is not just our voter laws. Earlier 
this month, the Republican-controlled 
New Hampshire House approved a re-
districting plan that can only be de-
scribed as gerrymandering. Taken to-
gether, these measures represent a 
comprehensive 
and 
coordinated 
at-
tempt to burden—or even deprive—cer-
tain Granite State citizens of their 
right to vote. Such blatant efforts to 
suppress the vote must not be toler-
ated. 
The right to vote is one of the most 
fundamental and cherished principles 
of our democracy. The history of our 
Republic is marked by those seminal 
moments when we as a nation extended 
the right to cast a ballot to broader 
populations, thereby including more 
voices in our representative govern-
ment: first after the Civil War with the 
15th Amendment, then to women with 
the 19th Amendment, and then notably 
with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. As 
others have noted, the Voting Rights 
Act has historically drawn great bipar-
tisan support for its reauthorization 
because the principles embodied in it 
go to the very heart of our democracy. 
But the issues and challenges that 
are increasingly facing our voters are 
very real and very troubling—and we 
must take them seriously or risk erod-
ing that most fundamental of rights. 
Making voter registration more dif-
ficult or making the process of voting 
more burdensome has disproportionate 
effects on some of the most vulnerable 
voters—whether those be young voters, 
communities of color, the poor, the 
homeless, among others. Eliminating 
or limiting opportunities for early vot-
ing, same-day registration, voting by 
mail, automatic registration, or the 
use of absentee ballots are all different 
pathways to the same pernicious ef-
fect—the suppression of the vote. 
That is why I am proud to cosponsor 
the Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Together, these bills would standardize 
voting election laws across the coun-
try, expand voting access and restore 
key provisions of the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act that have been struck down 
or weakened by the Supreme Court. 
The right to vote isn’t determined by 
political affiliation. It is the most sa-
cred right enshrined in the U.S. Con-
stitution for every eligible American 
and ensures that our country is, as 
President Lincoln said, ‘‘government of 
the people, by the people, for the peo-
ple.’’ 
I am deeply disappointed by the in-
ability—or unwillingness—of this au-
gust body to come together today to 
take this basic step in defense of our 
democracy. We, the U.S. Senate, ought 
to be the foremost champions and de-
fenders of democracy, but today, I fear 
that we have allowed partisan consid-
erations to distract us from that duty. 
We cannot afford to stay silent and 
ignore these measures that attempt to 
undo the progress that we have made 
over decades. We especially cannot 
stay silent when all of us here wit-
nessed the horrific events of January 
2021 and the attempt to undo a legiti-
mate election. Protecting voting rights 
for every American is the first and ir-
replaceable step towards protecting our 
democracy. We must take it seriously, 
we must not let it wither in the dark, 
and we must not stay silent. It is far 
too important—and once damaged, it is 
far too hard to rebuild.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING POWELL VALLEY 
MILLWORK 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week, I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Powell Val-
ley Millwork of Clay City, KY, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
Twenty-seven years ago Jim Thorn-
berry and his son Jimmy left the min-
ing industry behind in search of a new 
venture. Shortly thereafter, Powell 
Valley Millwork was founded. The 
Thornberry’s started their mill with 
the desire to harvest a tangible product 
within a sustainable industry, and that 
mission has stayed at the heart of their 
business throughout their decades of 
growth and success. 
The talent and substance of Powell 
Valley Millwork draws directly from 
our State, with the mill focusing on 
only one species of lumber: poplar. As

the State tree of Kentucky, poplar is 
an abundant resource within Appa-
lachia, which makes their location in 
rural Clay City a prime spot for their 
operation. Often referred to as ‘‘the 
painter’s wood,’’ poplar is known for 
its clear grain, smooth milling, and 
paint-taking qualities. The versatile 
and fine nature of the wood allows 
Powell Valley Millwork to supply con-
sumers with a wide variety of interior- 
trim products, such as stretcher bars, 
door and window jambs, stair parts, 
cabinetry components, primed finger- 
joint interior trim, and more. In cre-
ating all these products, the Powell 
Valley millworkers make sure nothing 
goes to waste. Poplar can be safely 
used as animal bedding which means 
the mill’s offcuts, those that are not 
already being used to fuel the com-
pany’s wood drying kilns, are turned 
into shavings. These shavings are then 
bagged and shipped out by the truck 
load to be sold in a wide variety of re-
tail outlets. 
This Powell County mill maintains 
their technology at a topnotch stand-
ard. In 2019 the owners invested in a 
new addition to the team: a sophisti-
cated scanning rough mill line from 
Eagle Machinery & Supply, Inc. The 
new rough mill line is able to process 
65,000 board feet of lumber in a single 8- 
hour shift with only six people required 
to operate it. The joint project between 
Powell and Eagle, both family compa-
nies, demonstrates that U.S. machin-
ery manufacturers can successfully 
compete with Europeans in providing 
world-class technology to the North 
American wood processing industry. 
The Thornberrys keep their eye on 
efficiency and progress, opening up 
ownership of the company to experts 
outside the family, including Brian 
Lambert, Powell Valley Mill’s General 
manager, and Dale Budke, the mill’s 
operations manager. As fellow owners 
of the company, these gentleman pro-
vide the expertise necessary for navi-
gating the growing Kentucky lumber 
industry. In 2019 Powell Valley Mill-
work acquired the Metrie Poplar manu-
facturing facility in nearby Jefferson-
ville, KY. With a new 125,000-square- 
foot location only 12 miles from their 
original facility, the two locations uti-
lize their natural synergies to support 
the needs of a diverse customer base 
across North America in full truck and 
railroad quantities. 
Powell Valley Millwork is a testa-
ment to the ingenuity and resourceful-
ness of Kentuckians. Drawing from our 
beautiful natural resources and em-
ploying over 200 local men and women, 
this business illustrates some of the 
best qualities Kentucky has to offer— 
fine craftsmanship and dedicated hard 
work. Powell Valley Millwork is a dec-
ades-old dream the Thornberrys had 
when they left the mining industry, a 
dream that has grown beyond what 
they had imagined. Small businesses 
like Powell Valley are the core of 
small towns across Kentucky, and like 
the poplars they use in their mill, their 
roots grow deep to help our commu-
nities flourish. Congratulations to the 
Thornberrys and the entire Powell Val-
ley team. I wish them the best of luck 
and look forward to watching their 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.∑

MARYLAND SCHOOL BOARD 
RECOGNITION MONTH 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, de-
votion, commitment, resilience—these 
are just a few of the words that de-
scribe the professionals who comprise 
Maryland’s 24 local boards of edu-
cation. 
The dedicated public servants who 
lead the school systems in Maryland 
counties and Baltimore City act with 
deep commitment to their commu-
nities and their time-intensive school 
board duties. Maryland school board 
members make critical budget and 
planning decisions, adopt policies to 
create supportive learning environ-
ments for all students, engage with 
parents, students, school staff, and 
other community stakeholders, work 
closely with superintendents, respond 
to crises, and undergo ongoing training 
to carry out effective governance, con-
tinue to grow as leaders, and stay up- 
to-date on the latest best practices. 
As devoted professionals who serve 
students, school systems, and their 
communities at large, Maryland school 
board 
members 
face 
an 
array 
of 
daunting challenges every day, chal-
lenges made significantly more dif-
ficult and complex during the COVID– 
19 pandemic. Yet Maryland’s 24 school 
boards have consistently risen to these 
challenges, working to ensure excel-
lence in public education throughout 
the State. 
School board members come from all 
backgrounds 
and 
professions. 
They 
may not agree on every issue, but they 
unite and volunteer to serve under the 
strong conviction that Maryland stu-
dents come first. 
Because of the extraordinary, con-
tinuing commitment of those who 
serve on our school boards to helping 
Maryland students grow, thrive, and 
excel each day—and with my ongoing 
commitment to Maryland public edu-
cation in mind—I am proud to recog-
nize 
January 
as 
Maryland 
School 
Board Recognition Month.∑

SENATE RESOLUTION 495—URGING 
THE 
INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE TO RELOCATE THE 
2022 BEIJING WINTER OLYMPIC 
GAMES IN RESPONSE TO THE 
REFUSAL OF THE PEOPLE’S RE-
PUBLIC OF CHINA TO END ITS 
EGREGIOUS 
HUMAN 
RIGHTS 
ABUSES, INCLUDING GENOCIDE, 
FORCED 
LABOR, 
AND 
CRIMES 
AGAINST HUMANITY 
Mr. LANKFORD (for himself and Mr. 
RUBIO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 495 
Whereas the Olympic Games should never 
be held in a country whose government is ac-
tively committing genocide, forced labor, 
and crimes against humanity; 
Whereas the ongoing crimes against hu-
manity perpetrated by the Chinese Com-
munist Party in the Xinjiang Uyghur Auton-
omous Region include— 
(1) the arbitrary imprisonment and other 
types of severe deprivation of physical lib-
erty of more than 1,800,000 civilians; 
(2) forced sterilization; 
(3) forced abortion; 
(4) infanticide; 
(5) torture; 
(6) forced labor; and 
(7) restrictions on freedom of religion or 
belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of 
movement; 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party is 
committing ongoing genocide as a direct at-
tempt to forcibly ‘‘assimilate’’, or eventu-
ally eliminate, vulnerable ethnic and reli-
gious groups; 
Whereas, on December 9, 1948, the United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
unanimously 
adopted the Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 
done at Paris December 9, 1948 (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘Genocide Conven-
tion’’), as a commitment of ‘‘never again’’ in 
response to the Holocaust and other crimes 
against humanity committed in the first half 
of the 20th century; 
Whereas, on November 5, 1988, the United 
States ratified the Genocide Convention with 
the understanding that the Genocide Con-
vention declares that all state parties ‘‘con-
firm that genocide, whether committed in 
time of peace or in time of war, is a crime 
under international law which they under-
take to prevent and to punish’’; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, former Sec-
retary of State Michael Pompeo determined 
that the Chinese Communist Party has com-
mitted genocide and crimes against human-
ity, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
has expressed agreement with that deter-
mination; 
Whereas, as of January 2022, 152 countries, 
including the People’s Republic of China, 
have ratified or acceded to the Genocide 
Convention, and each such country has its 
own national Olympic committee and is rec-
ognized by the International Olympic Com-
mittee; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee should always take human rights into 
account in making decisions, especially in 
choosing a host country for the Olympic 
Games; 
Whereas, in March 2020, human rights ex-
pert Rachel Davis and former United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights HRH 
Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein submitted to 
the International Olympic Committee a re-
port containing human rights recommenda-
tions; 
Whereas, on December 2, 2020, the Inter-
national 
Olympic 
Committee 
announced 
that it would incorporate ‘‘human rights 
standards into the ‘Operational Require-
ments’ of the Host City Contract for the 
Olympic Games 2024 and beyond’’, which does 
not apply to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic 
Games; 
Whereas, in their report, Rachel Davis and 
Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein— 
(1) note that ‘‘the human rights impacts 
that could be connected to the [2022 Beijing 
Winter Olympic] Games are severe—as our 
consultations 
with 
expert 
civil 
society 
stakeholders also confirmed—and addressing 
them remains challenging’’; and 
(2) urge the International Olympic Com-
mittee to consider ‘‘strengthening [human 
rights] due diligence across its operations 
[before 2024] and advancing the agreed stra-
tegic approach to engaging with Beijing 2022 
on human rights, with support from the top 
levels of the organization and informed by 
the [International Olympic Committee’s] 
own 
consultations 
with 
expert 
stake-
holders’’; 
Whereas there are no human rights condi-
tions set forth in the host city contract be-
tween the International Olympic Committee 
and the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China; 
Whereas there is no evidence that the 
International Olympic Committee has taken 
any steps to pressure the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China to change its be-
havior; 
Whereas the code of ethics of the Inter-
national Olympic Committee sets forth uni-
versal fundamental ethical principles that 
are the foundation of Olympism, including— 
(1) ‘‘respect of the principle of the uni-
versality and political neutrality of the 
Olympic Movement’’; and 
(2) 
‘‘maintaining 
harmonious 
relations 
with state authorities, while respecting the 
principle of autonomy as set out in the 
Olympic Charter’’; 
Whereas, historically, the International 
Olympic Committee has not maintained po-
litical neutrality, including by— 
(1) requiring the Government of Germany 
to accept qualified Jewish athletes on Ger-
man Olympic team during the 1936 Olympic 
Games 
(2) revoking South Africa’s invitation in 
opposition to the Government of South Afri-
ca’s policy of apartheid during 1964 Olympic 
Games, ; and 
(3) in 1948, banning Germany and Japan 
from participating in the first Olympic 
Games after World War II; 
Whereas taking action against genocide 
and crimes against humanity is a matter of 
morality, not politics; 
Whereas the absence of rule of law and due 
process in the People’s Republic of China in-
hibits the ability of the International Olym-
pic Committee and the respective national 
Olympic committees of participate countries 
to ensure the safety of all athletes, staff, and 
spectators throughout the duration of the 
2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games; 
Whereas, on November 2, 2021, 3-time 
Olympian Peng Shuai disappeared after stat-
ing that she had been sexually assaulted and 
forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang 
Gaoli, a former Vice Premier and member of 
the Chinese Communist Party Politburo 
Standing Committee; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee’s acceptance of the Chinese Com-
munist Party cover-up of sexual assault alle-
gations and dismissal of safety concerns for 
Peng Shuai call into question the Inter-
national Olympic Committee’s willingness to 
protect athletes participating in the 2022 
Olympic Games in Beijing; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee should not force athletes to choose 
between their conscience and their pursuit of 
the highest goals in athletics; 
Whereas Olympic athletes should not have 
to worry about— 
(1) wearing clothing or consuming food 
that is a product of forced labor; or 
(2) being penalized or detained by the host 
government for exercising their right to 
speak out against genocide, crimes against 
humanity, and any other human rights 
abuse; 
Whereas it is in the best interest of the 
athletes to move the Olympic Games in ful-
fillment of the International Olympic Com-
mittee’s mission ‘‘to promote safe sport and 
the protection of athletes from all forms of 
harassment and abuse’’ and ‘‘oppose any po-
litical or commercial abuse of sport and ath-
letes’’; 
Whereas, during the 2008 Beijing Olympic 
Games, the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China broke its commitment to the 
International Olympic Committee when it— 
(1) displaced Chinese residents in order to 
construct Olympic venues; 
(2) detained demonstrators; 
(3) censored the internet; and 
(4) restricted media access and the freedom 
of speech; 
Whereas the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games 
provided the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China the ability to perpetuate 
propaganda 
and 
distract 
from 
ongoing 
human rights abuses; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee should consider the individuals who 
will not be able to celebrate the Olympic 
spirit because they have been unjustly de-
tained, imprisoned, beaten, or worse by the 
government the International Olympic Com-
mittee selected to host the 2022 Winter 
Olympic Games; 
Whereas it reflects poorly on the entire 
Olympic movement, and therefore the inter-
national community in general, to proceed 
with holding the Olympic Games in a coun-
try whose government is committing geno-
cide and crimes against humanity; 
Whereas, on March 24, 2020, 4 months be-
fore the start of the 2020 Summer Olympics,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S384 
January 20, 2022 
the Government of Japan announced the 
postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games 
due to the COVID–19 pandemic, an action 
that demonstrates the ability to postpone 
the Olympic Games on short notice; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee has the right to terminate the host 
city contract with the People’s Republic of 
China if, at any time, ‘‘the IOC has reason-
able grounds to believe, in its sole discretion, 
that the safety of participants in the Games 
would be seriously threatened or jeopardized 
for any reason whatsoever’’; 
Whereas relocating the 2022 Winter Olym-
pic Games due to ongoing genocide and 
crimes against humanity perpetrated by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China is consistent with the vision of the 
International Olympic Committee to build a 
better world through sport; and 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee failed to adhere to its own human 
rights commitments by extending the honor 
of hosting the 2022 Olympic Games to Bei-
jing, particularly after Chinese authorities 
violated commitments to the International 
Olympic Committee in 2008: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate urges—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S385 
January 20, 2022 
S. RES. 498 
Whereas the goals of National Mentoring 
Month are to raise awareness of and cele-
brate the powerful impact of mentoring rela-
tionships, recruit new mentors, and encour-
age institutions to integrate quality men-
toring into their policies, practices, and pro-
grams; 
Whereas quality mentoring fosters positive 
life and social skills, promotes self-esteem, 
bolsters academic achievement and college 
access, supports career exploration, and nur-
tures youth leadership development; 
Whereas mentoring happens in many set-
tings, including community-based programs, 
elementary and secondary schools, institu-
tions of higher education, government agen-
cies, religious institutions, and the work-
place, and in various ways, including formal 
mentoring matches and informal relation-
ships with teachers, coaches, neighbors, faith 
leaders, and others; 
Whereas effective mentoring of under-
served and vulnerable populations helps indi-
viduals confront challenges and enjoy im-
proved mental health and social-emotional 
well-being; 
Whereas studies have shown that incor-
porating culture and heritage into men-
toring programs can improve academic out-
comes and increase community engagement, 
especially for Alaska Native and American 
Indian youth; 
Whereas youth development experts agree 
that mentoring encourages positive youth 
development and smart daily behaviors, such 
as finishing homework and having healthy 
social interactions, and has a positive im-
pact on the growth and success of a young 
person; 
Whereas mentors help young people set ca-
reer goals and can help connect mentees to 
industry professionals to train for and find 
jobs; 
Whereas mentoring programs generally 
have a significant, positive impact on youth 
academic achievement, school connectedness 
and engagement, and educational success, 
which leads to outcomes such as improved 
attendance, grades and test scores, and class-
room behavior; 
Whereas research has found that young 
people facing a risk of not completing high 
school but who had a mentor were, compared 
with their peers, more likely to enroll in col-
lege, to participate regularly in sports or ex-
tracurricular activities, to hold a leadership 
position in a club or sports team, and to vol-
unteer regularly, and less likely to start 
using drugs; 
Whereas mentoring has long been a staple 
of juvenile justice and violence prevention 
efforts, and can offer comprehensive support 
to youth at risk for committing violence or 
victimization, as mentoring can address 
many risk factors at once; 
Whereas mentoring relationships for youth 
facing risk, such as foster youth, can have a 
positive impact on a wide range of factors, 
including mental health, educational func-
tioning and attainment, peer relationships, 
employment, and housing stability; 
Whereas mentoring programs have been 
found to positively impact many aspects of 
mental 
well-being, 
including 
reducing 
unhealthy coping mechanisms, improving 
interpersonal relationships, and reducing pa-
rental stress; 
Whereas mentoring is an innovative, evi-
dence-based practice and, uniquely, is both a 
prevention and intervention strategy that 
can support young people of all demo-
graphics and backgrounds in all aspects of 
their lives; 
Whereas each of the benefits of mentors de-
scribed in this preamble serves to link youth 
to economic and social opportunity while 
also 
strengthening 
communities 
in 
the 
United States; 
Whereas despite the benefits of mentoring, 
one young person of every three is growing 
up without a mentor, which means a third of 
the young people of the United States are 
growing up without someone outside of the 
home to offer real life guidance and support; 
and 
Whereas 
this 
‘‘mentoring 
gap’’ 
dem-
onstrates the need for collaboration among 
the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to 
increase resources for relationship-centric 
supports for youth in communities, schools, 
and workplaces: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
recognizes 
‘‘National 
Mentoring 
Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the caring adults who serve 
as staff and volunteers at quality mentoring 
programs and help the young people of the 
United States find inner strength and reach 
their full potential; 
(3) acknowledges that mentoring supports 
educational achievement, engagement, and 
self-confidence, supports young people in set-
ting career goals and expanding social cap-
ital, 
reduces 
juvenile 
delinquency, 
and 
strengthens communities; 
(4) promotes the establishment and expan-
sion of quality mentoring programs across 
the United States to equip young people with 
the tools needed to lead healthy and produc-
tive lives; and 
(5) supports initiatives to close the ‘‘men-
toring gap’’ that exists for the many young 
people in the United States who do not have 
meaningful connections with adults outside 
the home.

AND 
SUPPORTING 
THE 
SURVIVORS OF INDIAN BOARD-
ING SCHOOLS, THEIR FAMILIES, 
AND THEIR COMMUNITIES 
Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. 
SCHATZ, Ms. WARREN, Mr. ROUNDS, and 
Mr. SULLIVAN) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was con-
sidered and agreed to: 
S. CON. RES. 28 
Whereas, more than 200 years ago, the Act 
entitled ‘‘An Act making provision for the 
civilization of the Indian tribes adjoining the 
frontier settlements’’, approved March 3, 1819 
(3 Stat. 516, chapter 85) (commonly known as 
the ‘‘Civilization Fund Act’’), was enacted 
and ushered in devastating policies and prac-
tices designed to assimilate American In-
dian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian 
children by removing the children from their 
families and Native communities throughout 
the United States; 
Whereas that Act intended to resolve what 
was commonly referred to in the United 
States as the ‘‘Indian problem’’ and was 
based on the unjust belief of many that Na-
tive people needed to be ‘‘civilized’’ and that 
education would be the appropriate vehicle 
to enact assimilationist policies on Native 
American people; 
Whereas, pursuant to that Act, numerous 
church- and government-operated boarding 
schools were established on and off Indian 
territories and homelands to house and edu-
cate numerous Native American children 
through policies and practices that sought to 
eliminate the cultural identity of Native 
children and assimilate them into main-
stream United States society; 
Whereas, according to the Native Amer-
ican Rights Fund, Native American families 
were torn apart by the removal of Native 
American children, either voluntarily or 
forcibly, from their homelands and commu-
nities to attend Indian boarding schools lo-
cated across the country; 
Whereas many parents of children sent to 
Indian boarding schools were forbidden to 
contact or visit their children, compounding 
the problem of isolation that negatively im-
pacted and continues to impact the lives of 
many Native children, their families, and 
their communities; 
Whereas the Native American Rights Fund 
also reported that an unidentified number of 
Native children died at Indian boarding 
schools 
due 
to 
abuse, 
neglect, 
malnourishment, or disease, and many of 
those children were buried far from their 
homes in unmarked graves or under tomb-
stones that misidentified the children or as-
cribed Anglicized names to the children; 
Whereas many of the parents of children 
who died at Indian boarding schools were 
never informed of the fate of their children; 
Whereas, according to a report issued by 
the Native American Rights Fund, many sur-
vivors of Indian boarding schools have testi-
fied that Indian boarding schools stripped 
Native American children of their tradi-
tional cultures, languages, and religions by 
forbidding the children to wear traditional 
clothing, speak their Indigenous languages, 
or practice their cultural, religious, or spir-
itual beliefs, and many of the boarding 
schools are known to have severely punished 
children who violated these policies through 
verbal, psychological, and physical abuse; 
Whereas many survivors of Indian boarding 
schools and families of children who at-
tended those schools have recounted details 
of the physical, sexual, and psychological 
abuse that countless Native American chil-
dren endured while attending the schools; 
Whereas, according to the report entitled 
‘‘The Problem of Indian Administration’’ and 
dated February 21, 1928 (commonly known as 
the ‘‘Meriam Report’’), many Indian board-
ing schools sent students to nearby commu-
nities for forced manual work as servants or 
farm laborers, and the operation of many In-
dian boarding schools was supported by the 
labor of the students; 
Whereas the Federal policy of Indian as-
similation and education has proven to be a 
disastrous failure and a national tragedy; 
Whereas, as stated in the report entitled 
‘‘Indian Education: A National Tragedy—A 
National Challenge’’ and dated November 3, 
1969 
(Senate 
Report 
91–501) 
(commonly 
known as the ‘‘Kennedy Report’’), ‘‘the dom-
inant policy of the Federal Government to-
ward the American Indian has been one of 
coercive assimilation’’ that had ‘‘disastrous 
effects’’ on the education of many Native 
American children; 
Whereas, in 2018, the United States Com-
mission on Civil Rights reported that many 
American Indian and Alaska Native people 
suffer from intergenerational trauma as a re-
sult of policies and practices of Indian board-
ing schools that alienated many children 
from their families, traditional cultures, lan-
guages, and religions, and deprived those 
children of their true identities and heritage; 
Whereas, while early assimilationist poli-
cies were eventually eliminated and Indian 
boarding school attendance has greatly di-
minished since its apex, the impact of this 
shameful period in United States history

still affects the lives of many Native Amer-
ican people today; 
Whereas many Native American people are 
still suffering from and trying to com-
prehend and cope with direct trauma, includ-
ing impacts on health and well-being, and 
the intergenerational trauma, that resulted 
from losing connection to family, culture, 
language, religion, and heritage; 
Whereas significant research shows that 
adverse childhood experiences, such as the 
experiences of many Native American chil-
dren who attended Indian boarding schools 
and the descendants of those children, can 
cause numerous negative health outcomes, 
increased suicide rates, and other harmful 
outcomes throughout life; and 
Whereas recognition that healing and pro-
motion of care for the mind, body, and spirit 
is essential to overcoming the dark shadows 
on United States history cast by Federal In-
dian assimilationist policies and practices 
carried out by the Federal Government 
through Indian boarding schools and ac-
knowledging the lived experiences of the Na-
tive American children and families who en-
dured and continue to endure the trauma 
and grief associated with Indian boarding 
schools: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That— 
(1) it is the sense of Congress that there 
should be a national day of remembrance for 
the Native American children who died while 
attending a United States Indian boarding 
school; 
(2) Congress recognizes, honors, and sup-
ports the survivors and the families and 
communities of children who attended such 
schools; and 
(3) Congress encourages the people of the 
United States— 
(A) to support and recognize the grief, 
pain, and hardship many Native American 
people suffered and still endure as a result of 
the assimilationist policies and practices 
carried out by the United States through In-
dian boarding school policies; 
(B) to honor the legacy of and remember 
those who were lost or harmed by those poli-
cies and practices; and 
(C) to appreciate the resilience of the sur-
vivors and their families with appropriate 
ceremonies, programs, events, and other ac-
tivities to support and commemorate a na-
tional day of remembrance.

TRIBUTE TO RAY ZACCARO 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I be-
lieve we are all familiar with the ques-
tion: If a tree falls in the woods and no 
one is there to hear it, does it make a 
sound? Well, here in the U.S. Senate, 
we can ask the question: If we accom-
plish something important but fail to 
communicate that to our constituents, 
did it actually happen? 
The majority of the American people 
have so much on their plates that they 
are not following the intricate, daily 
workings of this Chamber, so they ex-
pect their Senators to speak to them 
on a regular basis about the work they 
are doing on their behalf. 
As the author and former Presi-
dential speechwriter James Humes has 
said: ‘‘The art of communication is the 
language of leadership.’’ That is why 
each and every one of us, in turn, relies 
on the dedicated men and women to 
help us communicate with folks back 
home. 
I am here on the floor today to say 
farewell to a member of my team who 
has been so instrumental in helping me 
communicate to the people of Oregon. 
For the past now 71⁄2
years, Ray 
Zaccaro has served as my communica-
tions director. What a 71⁄2 years it has 
been, especially when you consider how 
drastically the media and communica-
tions landscape has changed in that 71⁄2 
years. We have gone from local news-
papers and cable news in serving as the 
dominant means of mass communica-
tion to Facebook and Twitter and 
Instagram and Snapchat and TikTok 
and others that are far too numerous 
for me to keep track of, but that is 
why we have a communications team. 
One day, produced video content per-
formed the best. The next, it was sud-
denly selfie-style videos. Videos used 
to do very well on Facebook. When the 
algorithms changed, they didn’t do so 
well. Then Instagram reels took off, 
and on and on and on. It is incredible 
how fast the communication world 
keeps changing. Since March of 2020, it 
has only gotten more chaotic as the 
pandemic has turned everything upside 
down, including how we consume infor-
mation and how we communicate. 
Ray Zaccaro expertly helped me and 
the entire team navigate this ever- 
shifting media landscape. As recording 
studios shut down, he mobilized the 
communications team to quickly tran-
sition to use a vast array of tools, in-
cluding Skype and Zoom, so that we 
could continue to get our message and 
timely information to the people of Or-
egon. 
That foresight and quick action are 
just extensions of his entire approach 
to communication—always challenging 
the members of our team to think out-
side the box and never being afraid to 
suggest new ideas, no matter how crazy 
they might initially seem. It doesn’t 
matter if they work in communica-
tions or on the legislative team or with 
constituent services. He believes every-
one on the team has a role to play in 
helping to develop and tell the story of 
what we are working to do. And he has 
proven right, time and time again, over 
the last 7-plus years. 
When Jeff Sessions, as Attorney Gen-
eral under the previous administration,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S388 
January 20, 2022 
gave his ‘‘zero tolerance’’ speech, I said 
to my team: It sounds like he is plan-
ning for a policy of tearing children 
out of their parents’ arms down at the 
border, and I am sure that is hyperbole 
because no American administration 
would ever do that to children. 
A member of my team said: There is 
one way to find out. Go down there 
yourself. 
Well, Ray, who is sitting behind me 
on the bench, took that idea and ran 
with it. We went down there the fol-
lowing Sunday, down to Texas, and he 
used his cell phone to livestream our 
attempts to try and ascertain exactly 
what was happening to young boys and 
girls. 
At a detention facility in McAllen, 
we were the first legislative team to 
witness that, indeed, Team Trump was 
ripping children out of their parents’ 
arms. I will never forget, as Ray and I 
walked into that facility, there was a 
group of press outside who said: What 
are you going to find? 
I said: I have no idea, but I will talk 
with you all when we come out. 
Ray and I went in and saw those chil-
dren in cages. And as we were being 
given a tour, I remember this group of 
young boys who were in one of the 
cages. They were being asked to line 
up—there were about 10 of them—from 
the shortest to the tallest, and the 
youngest was knee-high to a grass-
hopper. He was just maybe 4 years old. 
I asked: Where did these young boys 
come from? 
He said: Well, we brought them in 
that door over there, and we took them 
away from their parents. 
And in that warehouse room, the par-
ents were in other cyclone fence cages. 
And if the boys peered really hard, 
they might possibly see a parent or a 
sister, a father or mother, an uncle 
somewhere in that warehouse, but they 
had no idea what fate awaited them. 
We went outside and talked to the 
press outside and told them what was 
happening. And in a flash, it was na-
tional news about what was going on 
by our government in their treatment 
of young children. 
We went up the road to Brownsville. 
We had heard that there were a few 
hundred boys possibly being held in a 
former Walmart. I thought that was an 
astounding story, not possibly true, 
but should we go and check it out? Ray 
and I decided we would. 
We went up to this former Walmart. 
It had barriers to keep you from park-
ing in the former Walmart parking lot 
so we walked across the grounds to the 
door, where, by cell phone, I called up 
the number that was inside and said: 
We are here. I am a U.S. Senator, and 
we would like to have a tour, please, of 
your facility, if we could speak with 
your manager or your manager could 
come out and talk with us. Eventually, 
the manager did come out. His assist-
ant had said he would be talking to us, 
but, actually, what he did was he called 
the police. And he didn’t come out 
until the police cars were arriving. 
I think Ray, who was livestreaming 
the whole thing, secretly wanted me to 
be arrested and carried off in handcuffs 
to magnify the impact of the story. I 
am sorry, Ray, that it didn’t come to 
that, but the story had a tremendous 
impact. 
They would not let me into that 
Walmart to see what was going on, but 
the national scandal that ensued in the 
days that followed meant the press of 
the United States of America got in 
the following weekend, and a national 
debate started about who are we as 
citizens of the United States of Amer-
ica and who is our government and 
what are we doing to these children? 
It turned out there were not a few 
hundred boys in that facility; there 
were a few boys short of 1,500 in that 
single former Walmart. 
The work that Ray did that day re-
vealed the truth of Trump’s actions 
and shocked this Nation and moved 
this Nation to action. Horrified, as we 
continued to learn about the realities 
of the situation, Ray kept up the drum-
beat with his contacts in the media 
throughout months that followed to 
ensure that that story of traumatized 
children and how we can help them 
continued, and those children were 
never forgotten. 
Let me be clear. It wasn’t just the 
power of the story or the opportunity 
to get his boss—me—on television; he 
kept up the drumbeat because he is a 
passionate person who cares deeply 
about others. 
Countless members of Team Merkley 
could recount stories about a time 
when Ray went out of his way to help 
them, to provide comfort and support 
when they were going through a dif-
ficult moment in their lives, or just a 
call to check in on how someone is 
doing or a full-blown Italian feast de-
livered to the home of a fellow team 
member grieving the loss of a loved 
one. And as his work with those mi-
grant children separated from their 
parents at the border showed, he 
doesn’t have to know you personally to 
care deeply. 
One time Ray was out with me in Or-
egon for a series of townhalls, and a 
constituent showed up who was having 
a personal crisis. Ray went out of his 
way to make sure that man got the 
help he needed, while still continuing 
to do the other aspects of his job: at-
tending to members of the media, guid-
ing and supporting staff in their re-
spective tasks, and ensuring that the 
constituent had everything he needed. 
That is just who he is, the type of 
person who will drop everything if 
someone needs help, who will offer up 
his own apartment so his boss can 
come film an important, last-minute 
video when the planned location fell 
through. 
I couldn’t begin to count how many 
late nights and early mornings we 
spent together sitting for media inter-
views. I am thinking right now, here on 
the floor of the Senate, of a night a few 
years ago, when I was here through the 
night, speaking for over 15 hours 
straight to protest the theft of a Su-
preme Court seat by our former Presi-
dent and then-Majority Leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL. Throughout the night, 
there was Ray, in between running 
back and forth to the office to take 
calls from reporters and producers, re-
turning to flip floor charts as my 
speech proceeded. 
Thank you, Ray, for all that you 
have done for the team, for the people 
of Oregon, and for the people of this 
Nation. Thank you for your tireless ef-
forts to utilize communication tools at 
our disposal to protect our democracy 
and enhance the important issues that 
face our Nation, from healthcare to 
housing, to education, to living-wage 
jobs, to equality of opportunity, to 
taking on climate chaos. Thank you 
for bringing the passionate and long-
standing commitment to democratic 
politics and principals that were forged 
in your early experiences back home in 
Long Island, and you brought them to 
Capitol Hill. 
It is hard to picture what our Team 
Merkley experience will be after you 
leave because you have been such an 
integral part for so long. But know 
that while you will be deeply missed, 
we all wish you nothing but the best in 
this next chapter of your life as you 
continue fighting to build a better 
world. 
Thank you.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF JOHNNIE HODGES, SR. 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor World War II Navy 
Veteran, and a friend of Buffalo, the late 
Johnnie Hodges, Sr. Hodges who served as a 
light of inspiration to his local community, and 
I am proud to bring recognition to his life and 
legacy today. 
Mr. Hodges was a trailblazer. He began his 
service with the United States Navy on Janu-
ary 8, 1944 and following training in Bain-
bridge, Maryland, was stationed aboard the 
USS General Harry Taylor. Hodges served as 
a Stewards Mate Third Class on the troop 
transport ship during World War II, taking part 
in missions across the Atlantic and Pacific 
Oceans until his honorable discharge on June 
17, 1946. His participation, along with many 
other African Americans in the Armed Forces, 
led to the desegregation of the military and 
planted the seeds for Civil Rights Movement in 
the United States. He was also the first ever 
African American Foreman at Bethlehem 
Steel, a mill which was once the second larg-
est producer of iron in the United States. In 
addition to his work at Bethlel Steel for 35 
years, his wife, Flora, and he were entre-
preneurs, owning a successful delicatessen. 
Johnnie was known for his kindness which 
never went unrecognized by those around 
him. When he came back from serving our 
great country during World War II, he raised 6 
children with his wife Flora. Johnnie was 
known to always be helping others, from 
teaching teenagers how to fix their cars, to 
helping a young neighbor with his newspaper 
route. Johnnie also served his local commu-
nity by working as a bus driver for Buffalo for 
25 years. When he had fallen behind in mort-
gage payments as he was caring for his sick 
wife and was eventually evicted from his 
home, the local community rallied in support of 
Johnnie, and raised over 100,000 dollars in 
less than 24 hours to send Johnnie back to 
his home. This generosity by family, friends, 
and strangers, is a true testament to the kind 
of man Johnnie was, and his lifetime of kind-
ness was quickly repaid when he was in a 
time of need. These actions also dem-
onstrated why Buffalo is known as the ‘‘City of 
Good Neighbors.’’ 
Madam Speaker, please join me to bring 
recognition to such a significant member of 
the Buffalo community. It is an honor to be 
able to recognize Johnnie Hodges, Sr. today. 
He helped to make our world a better place 
with his participation in World War II which 
strengthened our democracy and freedom, 
and our community a better place by being a 
true pillar of service and sacrifice. All those 
who were lucky enough to have known him 
will greatly miss his generous spirit and for-
ever remember his lasting legacy of kindness.

Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to offer my sincere best wishes to Ken Norton 
as he steps down as Executive Director at the 
National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 
New Hampshire after many years of dedicated 
service in the field of mental health. 
During Ken’s long and successful career in 
community mental health advocacy, he will be 
remembered as a leading and influential voice 
for mental health awareness and access in 
New Hampshire. Ken has brought science- 
based grassroots mental health services to 
every community in our Granite State. We are 
grateful for Ken’s leadership as he grew the 
NAMI New Hampshire organization, while 
strengthening partnerships, building the orga-
nization’s capacity for support, education, and 
advocacy services. Our families, neighbors, 
and communities are better because of the 
work of Ken Norton. 
On behalf of New Hampshire’s Second Con-
gressional District, I thank Ken Norton for his 
exemplary service. I wish him the best of luck 
in the years ahead.

HONORING RICHARD ‘‘RICH’’ 
FREEDMAN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Richard ‘‘Rich’’ 
Freedman in celebration of his longstanding 
career in journalism. 
Upon graduating from Ygnacio Valley High 
School in Concord, California, and later from 
San Jose State University with a bachelor’s in 
journalism, Mr. Freedman began a 27-year 
long career with the Vallejo Times-Herald. 
Largely inspired by his late professor, Roger 
Budrow, and his late father, Bernie, Mr. Freed-
man had an immense passion for every mean-
ingful story. 
While he ended his long and illustrious ca-
reer with the Times-Herald as the Community 
Editor, he spent time covering the arts, sports, 
features, and wrote his own column. As the 
entertainment writer, he interviewed astro-
nauts, authors, a CIA operative, singers, moti-
vational speakers, and so many more. 
In addition to Mr. Freedman’s career with 
the Times-Herald, he spent much of his time 
serving his community. As a member of 
Reach Out Benicia, Contra Costa County 
Child Abuse Prevention Council, and the 
Benicia/Vallejo Humane Society, Mr. Freed-
man received an Honorable Mention from the 
Contra Costa Press Club and Humanitarian of 
the Year Award from the Vallejo Boys and 
Girls Club. He was also recognized by the 
California Army National Guard and received a 
California Commendation Medal. 
Mr. Freedman and his wife, Megan, have 
three children, Toby, Charlotte, and Beau, and 
one son, Cameron, who passed away in 2020. 
Mr. Freedman, throughout his career, has 
been known for his sense of humor, his pas-
sion, and willingness to serve his community. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. 
Freedman has dedicated his life and career to 
the betterment of Vallejo, Benicia, and jour-
nalism. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor him here today.

RECOGNIZING JOHN P. ANDERSON, 
DMD OF RAINSVILLE, ALABAMA 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to honor Dr. John P. Anderson of 
Rainsville, Alabama on his service to North-
east Alabama after 48 years of practice. Dr. 
Anderson’s decades of service to his commu-
nity and the State of Alabama exemplify the 
hard-working spirit of the people we have in 
Alabama’s Fourth District. 
Dr. Anderson graduated from Auburn Uni-
versity in 1969 where he was a member of the 
Phi Eta Sigma, Alpha Epsilon Delta, and Phi 
Kappa Phi honor societies. He continued his 
education at the University of Alabama School 
of Dentistry where he graduated in 1973 with 
his DMD degree. While at the University of 
Alabama School of Dentistry he was a mem-
ber of the Omicron Kappa Upsilon Honorary 
Dental Society and the American College of 
Dentists. He received the Dean’s Award, the 
highest award bestowed on a graduating sen-
ior, the Walter Pelton Community Dentistry 
Award, and the Academy of General Dentistry 
Award. 
After receiving his DMD in 1973, Dr. Ander-
son practiced in Rainsville, Alabama. Deep-
ening his dedication to his field, he served as 
a Delegate to the American Dental Association 
for 12 years, where he served as both Vice 
President and President. He also served as 
the President of the Dentistry Alumni Associa-
tion for the University of Alabama at Bir-
mingham. He has been honored with many

HONORING THE LIFE OF MEL 
REEVES 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of a long-time civil rights activist, jour-
nalist, and my friend, Mel Reeves who passed 
away at the age of 64 from COVID–19 com-
plications. 
Born in Miami, Florida, he was the youngest 
of 13 children and was adopted at the age of 
one. Bullied at a young age, Reeves grew up 
standing up for others and being an outspoken 
advocate for marginalized communities. Later 
in life he attended Northwestern College in 
Iowa, then moved to Minneapolis where he 
devoted his life to advocating for social justice. 
Mel Reeves was a journalist for the Min-
nesota Spokesman-Recorded newspaper and 
never shied away from elevating the truth. He 
was a devoted and passionate man with a 
fighting spirit, always ready to support his 
community advocating for justice and account-
ability. Reeves did not just write about the 
many injustices happening around him, such 
as the horrific murders of George Floyd and 
Daunte Wright, he used his voice and platform 
to encourage the community to never stop 
fighting for justice. 
As a community leader, he advocated for 
racial justice, education reform, the working 
class and more recently the need to protect 
oneself from the pandemic by wearing a mask 
and getting vaccinated. 
Reeves is survived by his son Kellen 
Reeves and five grandchildren. 
Rest in peace, friend. I thank him for inspir-
ing many to speak up for justice. 
HONORING 
DR. 
MAREK 
PIENKOWSKI’S 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF LIVING IN THE UNITED 
STATES 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, today I 
recognize Dr. Marek Pienkowski, an accom-
plished medical researcher and a cultural am-
bassador for Poland. This year he is cele-
brating his 50th anniversary of living in the 
United States. 
Dr. Pienkowski earned his M.D. and Ph.D. 
at the Medical University of Warsaw. In 1972 
he migrated to the United States to work with 
Hilary Koprowski, the inventor of the world’s 
first live Polio vaccine, to research cancer- 
causing viruses. He later became a post-doc-
toral fellow in clinical immunology at Johns 
Hopkins School of Medicine, and in 1984 he 
established a clinical practice to treat patients 
with allergies, asthma, and immunological dis-
orders. 
Today, medical research and findings from 
throughout Dr. Pienkowski’s career are widely 
distributed. He published more than fifty sci-
entific papers and two books, including the 
Handbook for Human Embryology used by 
medical students in Poland. 
Dr. Pienkowski was key to expanding cul-
tural, artistic, scientific, and business dialogue 
between the United States and Poland. He es-
tablished the Marek Maria Pienkowski Foun-
dation to facilitate cooperation and exchanges 
between the University of Tennessee’s School 
of Art and fine arts schools in Poland. He also 
founded PolandNow in Knoxville, a civic orga-
nization to promote and strengthen Polish- 
American relationships. 
During this time, former United States Am-
bassador to Poland Victor Ashe worked with 
Dr. Pienkowski to establish Knoxville’s Sister 
City relationship with Chelm, Poland. For his 
efforts to strengthen U.S.-Poland relations, Dr. 
Pienkowski earned an Honorary Consul of the 
Republic of Poland designation from the U.S. 
Department of State. 
When Dr. Pienkowski left Poland to make 
the United States his home, he brought with 
him his passions for helping people and build-
ing international relationships. Congratulations 
to Dr. Pienkowski for an impressive career, 
and I thank him for his contributions to our 
community.

RECOGNIZING ANNA MAE JONES, A 
DEDICATED PATRIOT 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to commemorate the remark-
able life of Anna Mae Jones, a military vet-
eran, teacher, dedicated community leader, 
and devoted wife and mother. Anna Mae led 
a long, exemplary life committed to service for 
her community and country. Her sacrifice and 
dedication to our American values made Anna 
Mae the truest embodiment of a patriot. Anna 
Mae was born in Saratoga Springs, New York 
on September 6, 1916. Raised in Tonawanda, 
she attended D’Youville College, earning her 
teaching degree in 1938. 
When the United States entered World War 
II, Anna Mae put her teaching career aside to 
enlist in the war. She strongly believed it was 
her civic duty, and a true honor, to be able to 
serve her country. Anna Mae joined the Wom-
en’s Army Auxiliary and served in New Guinea 
from 1943 to 1945. Specializing as the chief 
clerk to the Provost Marshal, Anna Mae was 
able to utilize her organizational skills as a 
teacher to help the war effort. Her commend-
able service record is evident through the nu-
merous awards, medals, and honors Anna 
Mae was given. As a Second Lieutenant, 
Anna Mae was awarded the Asiatic-Pacific 
Campaign Medal, Women’s Army Corps Serv-
ice Medal, and two Overseas Service Bars. 
It was during her time serving that Anna 
Mae met the love of her life, Lieutenant John 
Joseph Jones II. The two were wed in 1946 at 
St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Tona-
wanda. Anna Mae and John began their won-
derful life together in dutiful service to our na-
tion, assigned to bases in the United States 
and Europe. Together, they raised three beau-
tiful children. 
Anna Mae and her family returned to settle 
in Tonawanda in 1955. Anna Mae began her 
work as a special-education teacher at Central 
School in Tonawanda. Anna Mae dedicated 
her career to enhancing the learning experi-
ence for her students, ensuring they got the 
upmost out of their education. She frequently 
took her students on camping trips to teach 
them about nature and even started a summer 
school program for students in the special 
education department. Anna Mae was a true 
pioneer in the special education field, and the 
students of Tonawanda are forever grateful for 
her and her work. 
After her retirement in 1981, Anna Mae’s 
devotion to service remained steadfast, further 
immersing herself into the community and 
civic organizations around her. She sought to 
make a lasting, meaningful impact in the com-
munity she cared so deeply for, and so she 
did. Anna Mae was a member of St. Francis 
of Assisi Parish, the Ladies of Charity, the 
Women’s Army Corps, and the Tonawanda 
Women’s Democratic Club. Additionally, she 
served as Chaplain of the American Legion 
Post No. 264 in Tonawanda for 27 years, 
earning the Legion of Honor Award. Further-
more, Anna Mae was an active member in the 
Legislative Branch of the AARP, served as a 
board member of the Waterfront Revitalization 
Committee, and was an active member of the 
Historical Society of the Tonawandas for 50 
years. Three years prior to her passing at the 
age of 103, Anna Mae was honored at the 
Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating Anna Mae and her exemplary work 
in serving our country. We cannot afford to 
forget the powerful example citizens like Ms. 
Jones set for us. Let the memory of her life-
long service to something larger than herself 
summon our better angels to do our part as 
well.

HONORING RAYMOND L. 
CRAWFORD, JR. 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of a great 
man, Mr. Raymond L. Crawford, Jr. of Denton, 
Texas who passed away on January 17, 2022. 
He lived a full life and was a respected busi-
ness leader, philanthropist and beloved hus-
band and father. 
Mr. Crawford was born and raised in 
Lewisville, Texas where he was baptized at 
the First Presbyterian Church. He attended 
Lewisville High School and was a four-sport 
letterman. As President of the Senior Class of 
1958, he led a class trip to Washington, D.C., 
where the group met with their Congressman, 
Frank Ikard. He furthered his education at 
North Texas College in Denton. As a student, 
he was a football player and a member and 
President of the Geezles fraternity, graduating 
in 1963 with a BA in Mathematics. 
He was a life-long financial and insurance 
services professional, beginning his successful 
five-decade career with Northwestern Mutual 
with an on-campus interview at his alma 
mater. The trade association, Million Dollar 
Roundtable, recognized him in 2018 with a 
lifetime membership for having 50 consecutive 
years meeting the organization’s ethical stand-
ards and sales requirements. In addition, he 
was recognized by Northwestern Mutual in 
1983 as one of its top 20 salesmen in the na-
tion. He prided himself on doing his best to 
build client relationships based upon trust and 
integrity, and advising them with the best in-
vestment products to protect and provide for 
those most important in their lives. 
R.L.’s love for the University of North Texas 
manifested in his financial support and volun-
teer service on many UNT boards, including 
the UNT Board of Regents from 1989 to 1995 
and as chairman and emeritus director of the 
UNT Foundation Board. He was also a proud 
member of the Mean Green Club and the UNT 
Alumni Association. He also actively engaged 
in his community, serving in leadership roles 
as the President of the Greater Lewisville 
Chamber of Commerce, Chairman of Medical 
City Lewisville, and President of the Lewisville 
Rotary Club as well as multiple non-profits. He 
was named Lewisville’s 1983 ‘‘Citizen of the 
Year’’, an honorary lifetime board member of 
the Dallas United Way and a Paul Harris Fel-
low Rotarian. 
He was devoted to Brenda, his college 
sweetheart, and wife of 57 years. Their mar-
riage was blessed with two sons, R.L. ‘‘Trey’’ 
Crawford III, and F. Guy Crawford. Following 
in the steps of their parents, both men also 
graduated from the University of North Texas. 
R.L. Crawford, Jr. was a great personal friend 
and advisor to me and my wife. We extend 
heartfelt condolences to R.L.’s family; he will 
be deeply missed by his friends and family 
and the North Texas community. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
‘‘JACK’’ CASEY, JR. 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of a man who 
lived selflessly and embodied the true defini-
tion of a patriot. John ‘‘Jack’’ Casey, of Grot-
on, Connecticut, who passed January 4th after 
a lifetime of service to his community, his 
state, and his nation. 
Jack Casey was born on September 30, 
1946, to Catherine Agnes Keane McDonald 
and John George Casey, Jr. in Allston, Mas-
sachusetts. He attended high school in Brigh-
ton, Massachusetts, and graduated in 1964. 
Immediately following his graduation, Jack 
heeded the call to serve his country and en-
listed in the United States Navy. During his 
time in the Navy, he completed Disbursing 
Clerk Class A School in Newport, Rhode Is-
land; and soon advanced to the rank Dis-
bursing Clerk Third Class while stationed in 
New London, Connecticut. 
Jack chose to extend his enlistment by thir-
teen months, volunteering to serve his nation 
in Vietnam. He attended Counter Insurgency 
Training in Little Creek, Virginia; and served at 
National Security Activity in Da Nang, Vietnam 
RVN from July 1967 to July 1968. His time in 
the Navy earned him the Navy Unit Com-
mendation, Navy Good Conduct Medal, Na-
tional Defense Medal, Vietnam Service Medal 
with four bronze stars, Republic of Vietnam 
Gallantry Cross Unit Citation, Republic Navy 
Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Unit Citation, 
and Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. 
Following his discharge from the Navy, Jack 
returned to Groton and found employment at 
the Navy Exchange. In November 1968, Jack 
began his 33-year career at Pfizer Pharma-
ceuticals, working as a chemical operator. 
Jack worked for Pfizer until his retirement in 
November 2001. 
Soon after his retirement, he started volun-
teering for numerous groups. Jack epitomized 
the spirit of volunteerism; his tireless dedica-
tion to fellow veterans and to his community 
would define his life. While Jack volunteered 
for Meals on Wheels, he would frequently go 
above and beyond for the seniors on his 
route—buying them items from the store with-
out accepting reimbursement. In 2001, Jack 
began volunteering as a Registrar for the 
World War II memorial, inducting more than 
100,000 people into the World War II Registry. 
He also volunteered as a Registrar for the 
U.S. Navy Memorial and U.S. Army Memorial, 
registering over 75,000 heroes as Sea Service 
Personnel and over 75,000 heroes for the 
U.S. Army Memorial. 
I had the honor to witness first-hand Jack’s 
deep compassion for his country and fellow 
veterans when he joined my Veterans Advi-
sory Board in 2007. His participation and input 
as a member of the Board was invaluable as 
he identified real life problems within the Vet-
erans Administration that impacted our vet-
erans. However, the most remarkable quality 
about Jack was that for each issue he raised, 
he also brought forth constructive ideas to ad-
dress the problem. Veterans in eastern Con-
necticut and all across the country benefited 
from his passionate well-informed advocacy. 
Jack continued to be a champion of vet-
erans, becoming a member of the Patriot 
Guard Riders in 2008. During his time as a 
member of the Patriot Guard, his role would 
encompass that of a general member, a Ride 
Captain, and Assistant State Captain. He com-
pleted 5,000 missions from Vermont to New 
York. Jack also went on to serve as a board 
member for the Connecticut Patriot Guard 
from April 2008 to June 2019. 
In the midst of his work with the Patriot 
Guard, from 2009 to 2015, Jack volunteered 
as Logistic Support Manager and Guardian for 
American Warrior. He escorted World War II 
veterans to the World War II Memorial, some-
thing that he found deeply gratifying. 
Jack’s selflessness did not go unrecognized. 
In 2011, he was awarded the Outstanding Citi-
zenship Award by the National Society of the 
Son of the American Revolution. A year later, 
he was awarded the Norwich Area Council 
Veteran of the Year Award for his support and 
dedication to Norwich area Veterans organiza-
tions. And, on November 1, 2013, Jack was 
inducted into the 9th class of the Connecticut 
Veterans Hall of Fame—a well-deserved nomi-
nation that I enthusiastically supported. 
Not one to rest, in 2015, Jack helped estab-
lish a series of veteran coffeehouses across 
Southeastern 
Connecticut. 
These 
coffee-
houses offered and continue to offer veterans 
a 
network 
of 
support, 
resources 
and 
comradery. 
Jack stayed active in the veteran community 
until the end, participating in the Vietnam Vet-
erans of American, Chapter 20, and Easter 
Seals veterans Rally Point. Jack was a lifetime 
member of the VVA, VFW, DAV, and Sub-
marine Veterans Association. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege and an 
honor to represent constituents as selfless and 
humble as John ‘‘Jack’’ Casey, Jr. Though the 
gap he leaves in the fabric of Eastern Con-
necticut’s veterans’ community is one that 
won’t be soon filled, we can find solace in the 
reality that Jack’s hard work has touched thou-
sands. 
Jack 
undoubtedly 
left 
those 
he 
interacted with better and achieved his goal of 
leaving things better for those who come after 
him. I ask that my colleagues please join me 
in honoring Jack Casey, a man to whom we 
can all look as a model of leadership and 
service.

PETER C. WEISS 
HON. TROY A. CARTER

Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to remember the life, spirit, and leader-
ship of The Very Reverend Peter C. Weiss, 
S.S.J. 
I knew Father Weiss during his service as a 
Pastor to All Saints Catholic Church in my

Chaplain at the New Orleans Fire Department. 
He was an inspiring orator and a kind soul 
that steered the church through difficult times. 
Peter C. Weiss was born in Brooklyn on 
June 26, 1951 to Mr. and Mrs. Henry W.

He was a member of the Society of St. Jo-
seph of the Sacred Heart for 43 years until he 
passed away last week at the age of 70. 
Ordained in 1979, Father Weiss ministered 
primarily to African American communities 
across the country, including in Baltimore, 
Houston, Birmingham, and Washington, D.C. 
However, his longest ministerial service was 
in New Orleans, where he made a lasting 
mark on the community. 
Along with ministering to elderly, sick and 
homebound parishioners, Rev. Peter Weiss 
was a reserve fireman, a Chaplain to the local 
branch of the FBI, and taught at St. Augustine 
High School for 30 years. 
At the school he played indispensable roles 
as a Theology Teacher, Director of Color 
Guard, and Chief Religious Officer. 
In everything he did for St. Augustine, All 
Saints Catholic Church and the community, he 
kept Christ at the forefront. 
I’m sending prayers to Father Weiss’ family, 
friends, students, colleagues, and church com-
munity. 
He will be so missed. 
I take comfort that now, he is at peace with 
his Savior in heaven.

Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, on December 
25th Volusia County lost a great businessman 
and valued community leader, Mike Jiloty. 
Through Mike’s hard work and personal ap-
proach to business, he received hundreds of

NANSEN SKI CLUB 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the first competitive ski jumping 
event at the Nansen Jump Park in nearly 40 
years that will take place January 23, 2022. 
The Nansen Ski Jump was constructed in 
1936-38 by the city of Berlin and the National 
Youth Administration with help from with the 
Nansen Ski Club. 
For almost fifty years the Nansen Ski Jump 
was the premier ski jump in the country, 
hosting Olympic trials and National Champion-
ships. In 1988, the jump was closed and the 
site of the jump was overgrown and rundown. 
Winter sports are more than just a hobby in 
New Hampshire and throughout the United 
States; they are a way of life. I was proud to 
support Nansen Ski club’s efforts to restore 
and renovate the Nansen Ski Jump. The res-
toration of the Nansen Ski Jump site, and the 
return of ski jumping to New Hampshire’s 
North Country, will create an economic and 
communal boost to the region. 
On August 27, 2021 I was excited to visit 
the Nansen Ski Jump in Milan to see the 
progress on renovations. I am proud of the 
North Country community for coming together 
to make the project a reality. 
On behalf of my constituents across New 
Hampshire’s Second Congressional District, I 
thank them for all they do to ensure New 
Hampshire remains such a wonderful place to 
live, play, and raise a family.

RECOGNIZING 
CAPTAIN 
JOHN 
‘‘JACK’’ A. WALTER, A VIETNAM 
WAR HERO, ACTIVE VOLUNTEER, 
AND FAMILY MAN 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in recognition of Vietnam Vet-
eran Captain Jack Walter. Jack was born and 
raised to serve his country, community, and 
family. He grew up on the East Side of Buffalo 
and was the 8th of the 9 children of Joseph 
and Frances Walter. His father was a brick-
layer, so he always knew what it meant to 
work hard in life and never give up. He grad-
uated from St. Matthew’s Grammar School in 
1960, Canisius High School in 1964, and Gan-
non University in 1969. While in college he 
was a member of the Army ROTC Advanced 
Corps. With this solid foundation, Jack was 
ready to put his leadership skills to the test. 
He was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 
the U.S. Army, Field Artillery. He went to Viet-
nam and served with the 1st Cavalry Division, 
1st/21st Artillery. He was an Artillery Forward 
Observer with an Infantry Company, an Artil-
lery Liaison Officer for an Infantry Battalion, 
and an Assistant Executive Officer for his Fir-
ing Battery. While in Vietnam he served in part 
of the incursion into Cambodia in May and 
June of 1970 and was promoted to 1st Lieu-
tenant in Cambodia. 
Jack used his skills to save the lives of oth-
ers on the battlefield. He was awarded a Sil-
ver Star, the third-highest military decoration 
for valor in combat. He received the Silver 
Star for ‘‘Gallantry in Action while engaged in 
military operations involving conflict with an 
armed hostile enemy force in the Republic of 
Vietnam. First Lieutenant Walter distinguished 
himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 
June 22, 1970 in the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
During an intense ground battle involving a 
well-entrenched enemy force, First Lieutenant 
Walter, serving as Artillery Liaison, repeatedly 
came upon heavy enemy fire as he diverted 
devastating aerial and field artillery on enemy 
positions. With complete disregard for his own 
safety, First Lieutenant Walter performed in a 
courageous and professional manner as he ef-
fectively directed artillery while braving the in-
tense hostile fire.’’ 
Jack was also awarded a Bronze Star with 
an oak leaf cluster representing two Bronze 
Star Awards. He received a Bronze Star 
Award with Valor, the fourth highest award for 
military combat bravery during combat actions 
against an enemy force. The Bronze Star 
Award with Valor was ‘‘for heroism in connec-
tion with ground operations against a hostile 
force in the Republic of Vietnam. Second Lieu-
tenant Walter also distinguished himself by 
valorous actions on February 27, 1970 in Binh 
Long Province, part of the Republic of Viet-
nam. When his Platoon encountered small 
arms and automatic weapons fire from an 
enemy bunker complex, he immediately called 
in artillery and air strikes. His pinpoint accu-
racy forced the aggressors to flee their fortified 
positions.’’ He was awarded a second Bronze 
Star award for Meritorious Achievement in 
ground operations against hostile forces dur-
ing the period from October 1969 to October 
1970 in the Republic of Vietnam. In addition, 
Jack received an Air Medal with 4 oak leaf 
clusters representing 5 Air Medals in total, 
Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam 
Campaign Medal with 1960 Device, and sev-
eral other awards for his service in Vietnam. 
When he returned home from the warzone, he 
continued his military service by joining the 
U.S. Army Reserve. He was promoted to Cap-
tain in 1973. In 1974, when his military career 
ended, he spent the next 36 years in the aero-
space and defense industry. 
When Jack came back from Vietnam, he did 
whatever he could to use his leadership skills 
to help his family and his community. He was 
active in the Amherst Girls Softball League 
where he spent 11 years as a coach, Vice- 
President, Treasurer and Registrar and where 
he received the Amherst Girls Softball League 
Hall of Fame Award in 1991. He was the 
coach for Christ the King girls’ basketball team 
for 8 years and then went on to be the assist-
ant head coach for the Nardin Academy Var-
sity Basketball team for 5 years. He is active 
in Christ the King Church, having served as a 
member of the Parish Council for 12 years 
and president of the Parish Council for 2 
years. He was also Chairman of the Finance 
Committee at Christ the King Church for 5 
years. 
Jack couldn’t have been so successful in his 
life without the support of his family which in-
cludes his wife Janice, his three daughters 
which include Dr. Jacquelyn Dougherty who is 
an optometrist at the VA Western New York 
Healthcare System, Judith Dehn who is an 
athletic trainer at Excelsior Orthopaedics, Mary 
Colpoys who is a science teacher at Grand Is-
land High School, and his 10 grandchildren. 
Jack’s friend and fellow Vietnam Veteran Tom 
Bubar was instrumental in securing this spe-
cial recognition for Jack. Jack’s dedication to 
his troops in Vietnam, his family, and his com-
munity is an example of the selfless sacrifices 
that we should all make to ensure that our 
world and community is a better place to live.

Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the North Shore Senior 
High Mustangs for their victory at the Texas

cess. 
Their futures are bright, and I can’t wait to

COUNTY 
DETENTION 
LIEUTENANT JERRY S. BUSH 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of retired Lieutenant 
Jerry S. Bush, a committed servant of the 
Hempstead County Sheriff’s Department. Lieu-
tenant Bush passed away on Wednesday, 
January 5, leaving behind a legacy of joyful 
service to his beloved Hope, Arkansas home. 
Having started his career as a Reserve 
Deputy, Lieutenant Bush worked his way up to 
Deputy and was later promoted to Lieutenant 
in the county’s detention center. Lieutenant 
Bush also served many years as a Bailiff to 
the Arkansas Circuit Court. Remembered most 
for his service to the citizens of Hempstead 
County, Lieutenant Bush will always be re-
membered as a friend and servant to his com-
munity. 
I take this time today to honor the life of 
service exemplified by Lieutenant Jerry S. 
Bush. I thank him and his family for their dedi-
cation to our fellow citizens and our beloved 
Fourth District of Arkansas.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HON. E. 
G. ‘‘BUD’’ SHUSTER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Congressman Bud 
Shuster, who represented the people of cen-
tral Pennsylvania for over 30 years and wish 
him a happy 90th birthday. 
Throughout his career, Bud Shuster worked 
tirelessly to serve his constituents. As Chair-
man of the House Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure, he built broad coali-
tions of support that tackled some of our na-
tion’s greatest challenges and worked to im-
prove virtually every aspect of the nation’s in-
frastructure including our roads, bridges, air-
ports, ports, and waterways. Congressman 
Shuster was also a driving force in the con-
struction of Interstate 99, a vital route that 
connected Altoona, Bedford, and State Col-
lege to the rest of our Commonwealth and be-
yond. 
His work in Congress as the top Republican 
on the House Select Intelligence Committee 
was key in the creation of the CIA’s Counter-
narcotics Center and in passing legislation that 
specially equipped intelligence planes to lo-
cate Central American drug cartels, which at-
tempted to bring deadly drugs into our com-
munities. 
His work in the halls of Congress undoubt-
edly made our nation stronger, safer, and 
more prosperous. 
As his 90th birthday approaches, Bud Shu-
ster’s example should continue to inspire 
every member in this body to work to serve 
their constituents. On behalf of the people of 
the 13th Congressional District, I wish Con-
gressman Bud Shuster a happy birthday and 
many more happy and healthy years to come.

IN MEMORY OF MARILYN 
BERGMAN 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute and to honor the life and legacy of 
Marilyn Bergman, who passed away on Janu-
ary 8, 2022. Marilyn was an accomplished 
songwriter and a longtime President of the 
American Society of Composers, Authors and 
Publishers (ASCAP). I offer my most sincere 
condolences to her family and friends on her 
loss. 
A native New Yorker, Marilyn broke barriers 
as one of a relatively few women in the then- 
male-dominated songwriting business in her 
early career and as the first woman to serve 
as President of ASCAP, a position she held 
for a decade and a half. 
Over the course of her long and impressive 
career, Marilyn wrote the lyrics for many iconic 
songs as part of a songwriting duo with her 
husband Alan, including the Academy-Award 
winning ‘‘The Way We Were’’ and ‘‘The Wind-
mills of Your Mind,’’ as well as songs for the 
film Yentl and the theme songs to a number 
of popular television shows. During the course 
of her illustrious career, she was nominated 
for sixteen Academy Awards, winning three 
times, as well as earning four Emmy Awards 
and two Grammy Awards. Among her many 
accolades, in 1980 she was inducted into the 
Songwriters Hall of Fame. 
In addition to her work as a lyricist, Marilyn 
was a tireless advocate to protect the rights of 
songwriters. In 1985, she became the first 
woman elected to the Board of Directors of 
ASCAP. She later served as President and 
Chairman of the Board and presided over un-
precedented 
growth 
in 
the 
organization. 
Through her leadership of ASCAP, she was a 
strong partner to Congress, and particularly to 
the Judiciary Committee, in its work to support 
the music industry and to protect the rights of 
creators. Among her accomplishments, she 
worked to help pass the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act, a landmark piece of legislation 
governing copyright and the internet. This is 
but one example of her diligent efforts to en-
sure that songwriters and music creators can 
sustain a living through their creativity notwith-
standing the dramatic changes in technology 
that occurred during her leadership in the in-
dustry. 
Marilyn is survived by her husband, Alan, 
her daughter, Julie, and her granddaughter, 
Emily. 
Marilyn will be remembered by many Ameri-
cans for her artistic talents, as her lyrics 
graced our lives in so many ways. She will 
also be remembered by many songwriters for 
her strong advocacy on their behalf. May her 
memory be a blessing.

HAPPY 107TH BIRTHDAY TO 
CAPTAIN SYDNEY COLE 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Captain Sydney Cole 
as he celebrates his 107th birthday. A deco-
rated World War II veteran and lifelong resi-
dent of Buffalo, Mr. Cole is a beloved fixture 
of his community. Mr. Cole is a true inspiration 
to all those around him. 
Mr. Cole grew up in Buffalo, New York, and 
attended City Honors High School, where he 
was later inducted into the Distinguished 
Alumni Hall of Fame. Before the United States 
entered World War II, Mr. Cole enlisted in the 
Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1943, Mr. Cole 
joined the United States Army to continue to 
support the Allies. Then, First Lieutenant Cole 
recalls flying the artillery observation plane for 
the 776th Field Artillery Battalion and being in-
volved in the Battle of Rhineland and the Bat-
tle of Bulge. Mr. Cole will never forget what 
happened in the early morning hours of Janu-
ary 2, 1945, when his plane was shot down. 
Mr. Cole heroically saved his copilot, risking 
his life and becoming a prisoner of war. Cap-
tain Cole then went on to serve at a POW 
camp before discharging from the Army on 
December 27, 1945. 
The immense bravery, patriotism, and sac-
rifice of Mr. Cole does not go unrecognized. 
Mr. Cole’s exemplary service to our country is 
honored through his numerous medals and 
awards, including the Purple Heart Medal, 
Bronze Star Medal, and POW Medal. 
Mr. Cole returned to Buffalo to marry the 
love of his life, Sybil, and raise their son Rich-
ard together. From 1978 to retirement, he was 
the owner of Cole Motors and worked as the 
manager of the Buffalo Athletic Club. Mr. Cole 
is highly cherished and admired in the com-
munity for his extraordinary lifetime of accom-
plishments. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in wishing 
Captain Cole a very happy 107th birthday. I 
look forward to celebrating many more mile-
stones in the coming years and wish to extend 
my greatest gratitude to Captain Cole for his 
service and dedication to our country.

FIGHTING FOR PRO-LIFE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, last week in my district, under the 
leadership of Lisa Van Riper, Holly Gatling, 
and Sally Zaleski with South Carolina Citizens 
for Life, along with Lieutenant Governor Pam-
ela Evette and Attorney General Alan Wilson, 
I was grateful to participate in the largest ever- 
attended pro-life events in the state. 
Tomorrow in Washington, the annual Pro- 
Life March will take place where thousands 
come together to embrace the birth of babies 
on the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade 
decision. 
This increasing level of support is better un-
derstood than ever before. 
I am grateful to fight for pro-life values and 
am committed to advocating for the lives of 
the unborn, while also protecting the rights of 
health care providers who refuse to engage in 
abortions. 
The Democrat elite think they are smarter 
than everyone and think Democrat voters and 
Democrat media are ignorant to believe that 
trillion-dollar spending ‘‘costs zero dollars.’’ 
In conclusion, God Bless our troops, who 
successfully protected America for 20 years, 
as the Global War on Terrorism continues 
moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to 
America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DOUG 
HEAD 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Doug Head 
was born in Midland, Michigan. He earned a 
degree in economics at Lawrence University in 
Wisconsin but spent over a year studying at 
the University of Singapore. He served in the 
Peace Corps in Argentina, Brazil, and Para-
guay before becoming a Central Florida resi-
dent in the early 1980s. Doug became the Ex-
ecutive Director of an organization that lobbied 
on behalf of AIDS patients, which he received 
recognition for in Forbes magazine calling him 
one of the ten most powerful voices in the in-
surance industry. 
In the late 1980s, Doug became interested 
in politics and ran his first campaign in 1986. 
He also volunteered for the local Democratic 
party and worked to modernize their computer 
database. Soon after, Orange County’s party 
registration flipped from a majority of Repub-
lican voters to a majority of Democratic voters. 
Doug served as Orange County Democratic 
Executive Committee (DEC) Chair from 1992 
to 2004 and as the Orange County DEC’s 
State Committeeman from 2016 to 2020. 
As Chair, Doug encouraged interest groups 
to form clubs within the party. The first of 
which was the Orange County Rainbow 
Democratic Club, which was created in 1993 
to promote the rights of members of the 
LGBTQ+ community. He also hosted a month-
ly social event, called ‘‘First Friday,’’ which be-
came a gathering place for likeminded Demo-
crats in Central Florida who attended the 
event to network and strategize about cam-
paigns and registering Democrats. 
Doug later became the chair of County 
Watch, a local watchdog group, that pushed 
for transparency and accountability in county 
government and agencies. He also worked 
with local non-profit organizations to empower 
minority committees. Doug was a mentor to 
many aspiring political operatives and commu-
nity leaders. His wealth of knowledge was 
widely recognized and respected among polit-
ical leaders across Florida. 
He made several TV appearances, including 
the Daily Buzz and Central Florida news affili-
ates for FOX (WOFL) and ABC (WFTV), as 
well as being quoted in journals and news-
papers, including The Wall Street Journal, The 
Washington Post, National Underwriter and 
Chicago Tribune, among others. 
Doug Head passed away on the evening of 
November 13, 2021, in Orlando and is sur-
vived by his sisters, Meredy Jenkins and Bar-
bara Cornelius, and his brother-in-law, Dennis 
Jenkins. His decades of commitment to the 
Central Florida community and the Democratic 
Party left a lasting foundation for others to 
build upon. His wisdom and guidance will be 
missed by many.

LAND CONVEYANCE FROM BEALE 
AIR FORCE BASE TO THREE RIV-
ERS LEVEE IMPROVEMENT AU-
THORITY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce legislation that would convey a small 
land parcel at Beale Air Force Base (AFB) in 
northern California to the Three Rivers Levee 
Improvement Authority for the Congressionally 
authorized Yuba Goldfields Levee Improve-
ment Project. I thank my colleague Congress-
man DOUG LAMALFA (R–CA01), the bill’s origi-
nal cosponsor, who represents the neigh-
boring Congressional district. 
The Three Rivers Levee Improvement Au-
thority is responsible for providing 200-year 
flood protection for southern Yuba County in 
California, protecting homes, businesses, and 
military infrastructure at Beale AFB. As a sen-
ior member of the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Re-
sources and Environment, I secured authoriza-
tion for the Yuba Goldfields Levee Improve-
ment Project in the America’s Water Infra-
structure Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–270). 
The Three Rivers Levee Improvement Author-
ity is the non-federal sponsor for this project, 
which will provide 200-year level of flood pro-
tection to the community surrounding Beale 
AFB. 
Specifically, this project extends the Yuba 
River South Levee and crosses Beale AFB 
outside the fence line. Upon completing sur-
vey work for the proposed levee improvement 
project, the Three Rivers Levee Improvement 
Authority discovered that the U.S. Air Force 
owned a small parcel of approximately 0.3 
acres outside the fence line and separated 
from the rest of Beale AFB by Smartville 
Road. In September 2020, I helped to secure 
a 25-year easement from the Air Force on be-
half of the Three Rivers Levee Improvement 
Authority needed to construct, operate, and 
maintain the levee. 
However, this legislation would convey own-
ership of the 0.3-acre parcel from the Air 
Force to the Three Rivers Levee Improvement 
Authority, so that the non-federal sponsor can 
continue to ensure area flood control in per-
petuity. This public interest land conveyance 
will ensure that the area, including Beale AFB, 
is better protected from future flooding. 
As chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee, I plan to legislate this land con-
veyance necessary for the long-term mainte-
nance of the Yuba Goldfields Levee Improve-
ment Project in the FY2023 National Defense 
Authorization Act, if necessary. This is but one 
example of how Congress can make our mili-
tary installations more resilient to flooding and 
other extreme weather exacerbated by climate 
change by improving coordination between the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ civil works 
projects and the service branches.

REMEMBERING DONALD EUGENE 
JORDAN 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Donald Jordan, who 
passed away on November 28th after a coura-
geous and lengthy battle with cancer. 
Mr. Jordan is a lifelong Michigander born in 
Flint, Michigan, on April 15, 1943. In 1961, he 
graduated from Plymouth High School but 
stayed connected to his school and class-
mates through his leadership as a member of 
the Class Reunion Committee. In college, he 
was an active member of the Fraternity Phi 
Delta Tau and graduated from the University 
of Michigan in 1975 with a Degree in Mechan-
ical Engineering. Mr. Jordan worked at Ford 
Motor Company for over 30 years, during 
which time he earned his Professional Engi-
neering Certification. He is survived by his 
wife Alice Jordan, his sons James and David, 
and his grandchildren Maxwell, Isabella, and 
Josue. 
Mr. Jordan loved spending time with his 
family. They traveled on many vacations, in-
cluding camping trips up North, Cooperstown, 
Myrtle Beach, Toronto, and Key West, but his 
favorite was the annual trip to Cancun. As a 
husband, he was deeply devoted to Alice, and 
they cared for each other through the course 
of their 49 years of marriage. As a father and 
grandfather, he was dependable and com-
forting, very involved in his children and 
grandchildren’s activities, and always in the 
stands cheering them on. 
In his free time, Mr. Jordan was a band 
member at his church and a proud member of 
the Plymouth Community Band. He played 
several instruments, including the euphonium, 
and taught accordion lessons. Furthermore, he 
volunteered at the Ascension Hospital for 
many years, where he valued the opportunity 
to care for others. 
Mr. Jordan lived his life devoted to his fam-
ily, helping others, and caring for the commu-
nity around him. His example of love for his 
family and his community will forever be a re-
minder to his children, his grandchildren, and

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
JAMES HOOLEY, HEAD OF POLIT-
ICAL SECTION AT THE BRITISH 
EMBASSY 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the invaluable service of James 
Hooley, who has served as the head of the 
political section at the British Embassy in 
Washington D.C. for the past five years. 
Throughout his tenure, James has personified 
the Special Relationship between the United 
States and the United Kingdom with his tire-
less work, diligent commitment, and affable 
personality. 
As one of our key liaisons with the United 
Kingdom, James has facilitated bipartisan en-
gagement with Congressional members and 
all levels of the British Government, from 
Prime Ministers to Cabinet Ministers, Members 
of Parliament, and members of the Royal 
Family. Through two Presidential Administra-
tions and two Prime Ministers, James has led 
the British Embassy’s political operations, en-
suring we in the United States remain well 
connected with our allies across the Atlantic. 
James has been steadfast in ensuring the 
highest diplomatic channels between our two 
countries remain open and well-used for the 
range of issues covered by the U.S.-U.K. rela-
tionship. 
James will be transitioning back to the For-
eign, Commonwealth and Development Office 
in London where I have no doubt he will 
achieve the same success. The Special Rela-
tionship between the United States and the 
United Kingdom remains special thanks to the 
work of diplomats like James Hooley. We in 
Congress will miss his work at the Embassy 
and wish him nothing but the best for his fu-
ture endeavors.

REMEMBERING THE SECOND VIC-
TIM OF THE COVID–19 PANDEMIC 
IN 
ERIE 
COUNTY, 
WALTER 
MONAHAN, A DECORATED VET-
ERAN, 
FAMILY 
MAN, 
AND 
A 
FRIEND TO ALL 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to commemorate the remark-
able life of Walter Monahan, an exceptional 
man who was taken far too soon due to 
COVID–19. Walter was a decorated Vietnam 
military veteran, an active community leader 
and volunteer, and a devoted husband, father, 
and grandfather. Unfortunately, on Wednes-
day, March 25, 2020, Walter became the sec-
ond resident in Erie County to pass due to 
COVID–19. His wife, Valerie Monahan, and 
his family, wishes for the public to remember 
Walter for the extraordinary person he was, 
not just as a statistic in a public health emer-
gency. Walter’s unfortunate passing allows us 
to honor his legacy and the incredible work he 
did while reminding us all that we must con-
tinue to actively take a stand against COVID– 
19. 
Walter’s lifelong commitment to serving his 
country is beyond commendable. He was a 
Petty Officer second class in the United States 
Navy. Walter’s military career began when he 
served two tours on a destroyer during the 
Vietnam War. From there, the Navy truly be-
came a part of Walter’s blood. When his tours 
ended, Walter was transferred to the Pen-
tagon to work for the Chief of Naval Oper-
ations. Walter also was a dedicated and active 
veteran. He marched with the Rochester Viet-
nam Veterans Chapter 20 marching unit and 
served on the board of directors. 
I had the honor of meeting Walter myself 
and presenting him with a Vietnam Lapel Pin 
in thanks for his remarkable service. Walter’s 
immense dedication, sacrifice, and service 
does not go unrecognized. He exemplified 
what it means to truly be a patriot, dedicating 
himself to our American values and serving 
his country proudly. 
It was while he worked at the Pentagon that 
Walter met the love of his life, Valerie. The 
two soon got married and returned to Roch-
ester, where Walter had grown up. Together, 
Walter and Valerie raised two lovely children, 
their daughter, Kelly and their son, Michael. 
After moving to Buffalo in 2007, Walter worked 
as a facilities director for People Inc’s Senior 
Centers. He is remembered by his co-workers 
for his exceptional customer service, incredible 
family-oriented mindset, and his immense 
compassion. They reflect on Walter as being 
‘‘the kind of employee everyone would want 
on their team—skilled, caring, friendly, funny 
and enjoyable to know.’’ 
A pinnacle of his community, Walter addi-
tionally dedicated his time to being an active 
member 
of 
numerous 
organizations. 
He 
served as a Eucharistic minister at St. Joseph 
University Parish, a docent at the Buffalo and 
Erie County Naval and Military Park, a Meals- 
on-Wheels volunteer, and a school bus driver. 
Walter, a true family man at heart, also be-
came a fixture at just about every event in-
volving his grandchildren during his retirement. 
Walter nobly dedicated his life to service in all 
manners. He went above and beyond in work-
ing to make a better community for all, a true 
testament to his dedication to service. 
COVID–19 wrongfully claimed the remark-
able life of Walter, taking his life all too soon. 
After noticing Walter was not getting enough 
oxygen, his wife of 50 years, Valerie, called 
911 and Walter was admitted to Kenmore 
Mercy Hospital. Walter’s family believed he 
would recover quickly, thinking he simply had 
pneumonia or bronchitis. Unfortunately, Val-
erie was never able to see her beloved hus-
band conscious again. Hours after he arrived 
at the hospital, Walter was attached to a venti-
lator and put under a medically induced coma. 
The family was allowed just moments at his 
bedside before Walter’s passing. Despite the 
persistence and dedication of the doctors, 
there was nothing more that could be done for 
Walter. Walter passed on March 25, 2020 at 
the age of 74 due to COVID–19, being the 
second Erie County resident to lose their life 
to the deadly disease. 
After Walter’s tragic passing, Valerie dedi-
cated herself to mobilizing people in the com-
munity to take a stand against COVID–19. 
Valerie’s early and persistent calls for mask 
usage along with her active pursuit in spread-
ing the truth about the virus was vital in keep-
ing our community safe during such chal-
lenging times. The people are forever in debt 
to Valerie for her work in taking preventive 
measures against COVID–19 and advocating 
for others to do the same. 
Today, I wish to echo Valerie’s calls for ac-
tion and encourage the American people to 
get the COVID–19 vaccine. We now have the 
means to protect ourselves and our loved 
ones from this horrible disease. Getting the 
COVID–19 vaccine is the best way we can 
prevent another loss such as Walter. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in celebrating Walter 
and the extraordinary life of service he led and 
in choosing to actively stand against COVID– 
19 by getting vaccinated. Walter was an in-
credible man who dedicated his life to serving 
his country and community nobly. His life was 
cut all too short due to this horrible and deadly 
virus. By getting the COVID–19 vaccination, 
each person is actively taking a step to ensure 
we do not lose any more American citizens to 
this illness. May we honor Walter’s legacy and 
remarkable life by ensuring his death is not in 
vain; we must continue to protect our commu-
nities and country in the same fashion Walter 
did during his lifetime.

HONORING NIKOLA ‘‘NICK’’ 
VOYVODICH 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Nikola ‘‘Nick’’ 
Voyvodich in celebration of his longstanding 
career in law enforcement. 
Born in Oakland, California, at Oaknoll 
Naval Hospital, Nikola ‘‘Nick’’ Voyvodich was 
no stranger to the definition of bravery, as his 
father was wounded in action as a United 
States Marine. After receiving an associate of 
the arts degree from Ohlone College, on Au-
gust 25, 1994, Mr. Voyvodich joined the New-
ark Police Department as a reserve officer, 
jump starting his career in law enforcement. A 
few years later, on March 2, 1994, Mr. 
Voyvodich became a full-time police officer 
with the Martinez Police Department. 
His illustrious career included a strong dedi-

TRIBUTE TO GLEN AND KERRY 
FLETCHER 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Glen and Kerry 
Fletcher, who are jointly being honored as the 
2021 Citizen of the Year by the Corona Cham-
ber of Commerce. Glen and Kerry have been 
true leaders in my hometown of Corona for 
more than three decades, and residents 
throughout our community deeply appreciate 
their many contributions. 
Glen and Kerry first met in high school 
where Kerry was a song leader and Glen was 
president of the Future Farmers of America. 
After a few dates, Kerry was introduced to the 
family business, Pete’s Road Service, which 
was run by Pete and Clara Fletcher. Soon 
after, Kerry would join Glen by working at the 
business and contributing to its success. 
Eventually they would marry, and after living 
for stretches in Fullerton and Norco, the 
Fletcher family moved to Corona in 1986. In 
addition to expanding Pete’s Road Service, 
the Fletcher family grew with the additions of 
their children, Amanda, Melissa, and Nathan. 
Over the past 30 years, the Fletchers have 
volunteered their time and resources into the 
Corona community in many ways. With chil-
dren active in youth athletics, the Fletchers 
recognized a need for additional soccer devel-
opment opportunities in the region. In 1992, 
they founded the Corona United Soccer Club, 
and Glen served as its President for 12 years. 
Not to be outdone, Kerry contributed in a vari-
ety of roles over the years, including as a 
coach, Board Treasurer, and Registrar. In 
2005, Glen joined the Corona Rotary where 
he chaired the club’s Lobsterfest fundraiser in 
2011 and served as President in the 2011/ 
2012 year. Glen and Kerry have also been 
members of the Navy League and a number 
of other local clubs and organizations benefit-
ting our city. 
Today, Glen and Kerry enjoy another treas-
ured role—being grandparents. With their in-
credible record of service, the Fletchers are in-
credibly deserving of the Citizen of the Year 
award from the Corona Chamber of Com-
merce. I would like to thank Glen and Kerry 
for their dedication to our community and wish 
them the very best in the future. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
GOVERNMENT 
TITLE EQUALITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Government 
Title Equality Act. This bill would amend the 
D.C. Home Rule Act to redesignate the Mayor 
of the District of Columbia as the Governor, 
the D.C. Council as the Legislative Assembly, 
the D.C. Councilmembers as Representatives 
and the Chair of the Council as the Speaker. 
The new titles are the ones used in the State 
of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth con-
stitution, which the District adopted in 2016 in 
anticipation of passage of the Washington, 
D.C. Admission Act, which would make D.C. 
the 51st state. 
I introduce this bill to highlight to the Amer-
ican people and Members of Congress that 
there would be a seamless transition to D.C. 
statehood because D.C. already operates as 
the functional equivalent of a state, providing 
state-, county- and city-level services, despite 
being denied voting representation in Con-
gress and full local self-government. 
This bill would not change any D.C. legal 
authorities. 
This is an important step to provide greater 
equality for the District, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.

REMEMBERING WILLIAM J. WOOD 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, my wife Roxanne, the Wilson family, 
and I would like to express our condolences to 
the family of William J. Wood. He, his late 
wife, Nancy, and his daughter, Lou, have been 
greatly appreciated civic and business leaders 
of the Midlands of South Carolina. With East-
man Chemicals, Midlands Technical College, 
and Nephron Pharmaceuticals, the Kennedy 
Family has provided innumerable people with 
meaningful jobs. I am grateful to include in the 
RECORD his obituary in fond remembrance. 
WILLIAM J. WOOD 
(June 23, 1937–January 16, 2022) 
OBITUARY OF WILLIAM J. WOOD 
William Jerry Wood, of Lexington, passed 
away on Sunday, January 16, 2022 at his 
home. 
The son of the late Oscar Benjamin and 
Faye Hooper Wood, Mr. Wood was born in 
Commerce, GA, started his career at East-
man Chemical Company in Kingsport, TN, 
and made Lexington his home for more than 
a half century. He was a beloved husband, fa-
ther, grandfather and great grandfather. 
As a young man, Mr. Wood’s family moved 
around Appalachia. During this period, Mr. 
Wood’s father was following his calling to 
serve Baptist congregations around the re-
gion, as a minister. His father also owned a 
dry cleaning business, in which the entire 
family pitched in. At the age of 18, Mr. Wood 
started his career at Eastman in Kingsport, 
TN, where the family had settled. 
Mr. Wood devoted more than four decades 
in leadership and management to Eastman 
Chemical Company. With the exception of 
his family, Mr. Wood did not take more pride 
in anything than his work. He left an indel-
ible mark on the company and its employees, 
many of whom continue to pass down the 
lessons they learned working with Mr. Wood. 
He taught a Machine, Tool, Technology class 
to local technical college students for more 
than 15 years. 
The Midlands Technical College Life Skills 
Center is named in honor of Mr. Wood. Since 
opening in 2014, the center has helped Mid-
lands Tech students prepare for life after 
school by honing essential skills needed to 
start a career. 
The father of Lou Wood Kennedy, Mr. 
Wood embraced life in the Midlands of South 
Carolina when he relocated his family here, 
in 1965, as he continued to grow in manage-
ment at Eastman. Mr. Wood was active in 
community endeavors, such as service orga-
nizations like the Lions Club, hobby-focused 
clubs, such as the Antique Car Club of Amer-
ica South Carolina Chapter, and in the Bap-
tist church. His daughter, beaming with 
pride, called Mr. Wood the greatest man she 
has ever known, and he loved watching the 
role she plays in making her own mark 
today on the community he chose as their 
family home. 
Mr. Wood met his wife, Nancy Thomas 
Wood, as a teenager. They dated as students 
at East Tennessee State University. His fa-
ther married the couple. Mr. and Mrs. Wood 
celebrated 61 years of marriage last year. 
Surviving Mr. Wood are his daughter, Lou 
Wood Kennedy of Lexington (Bill); grand-
daughter, Xanna Bailey of Lexington (Trav-
is) and great-grandson, Lincoln Bailey. Mr. 
Wood is also survived by Paul Wood (Mil-
dred), Sarah Benson, Daniel Wood (Cara), Re-
becca (Chuck) and countless nieces, nephews, 
cousins and friends. The family wants to say 
a special thank you to Amya Bryant for the 
love and care she provided over the last five 
months.

HONORING MONTFORD POINT MA-
RINE ROSCOE BROWN FOR HIS 
COURAGE, 
TRAILBLAZING 
DE-
TERMINATION, 
AND 
SELFLESS 
SERVICE TO OUR GREAT NATION 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 20, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in recognition of Roscoe 
Brown, a member of the Montford Point Ma-
rines, an elite team of men who bravely 
signed up to fight abroad for our nation’s free-
dom even while they were being denied equal 
rights here at home. We will never forget his 
courage, trailblazing determination, and self-
less service. 
In 2011 I co-sponsored H.R. 2477, a bill to 
grant the Congressional Gold Medal to the 
Montford Point Marines. The legislation was 
approved by Congress and signed by Presi-
dent Obama. In November of 2012 a cere-
mony was held to present many of the Ma-
rines with their medals, however Mr. Brown 
was unable to attend. In April of 2013 my of-
fice secured the medal and at Mr. Brown’s re-
quest, I presented the honor in a special cere-
mony at Bethesda World Harvest International 
Church in Buffalo, where Brown served as a 
Deacon.

January 20, 2022 
During the struggle of World War 11, Amer-
ica called Mr. Brown and the Montford Point 
Marines to duty, and they answered with self-
less service in defense of our freedoms. The 
1941 Fair Employment Act prohibited racial 
discrimination by federal agencies; finally giv-
ing African-Americans the right to enlist in the 
Marine Corps. However, like the rest of Amer-
ica at the time, military training facilities were 
segregated. Camp Montford Point in Jackson-
ville, North Carolina served as the training site 
for African-American men eager to serve in 
the Marines. Over a 7 year period beginning 
in 1942, approximately 20,000 African Ameri-
cans were trained at the Camp, many serving 
during World War II. In 1949 Montford Point 
Camp was deactivated and all recruits were 
trained side-by-side. 
The Public Affairs office of the United States 
Marine Corps added, ‘‘The sacrifice of these 
men paved the way for other minorities and all 
women to be integrated into the Marine Corps. 
By their sacrifice, MPM’s engineered social 
and cultural change in the Marine Corps that 
created a lasting impact and has contributed 
to the success of the Marine Corps today.’’ 
Born in 1927 in Texas, Roscoe Brown came 
to Buffalo in 1944 and resided in Williamsville, 
New York. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 
July of 1945, was squad leader in boot camp 
and served as a personnel clerk in the United 
States Marine Corps before being honorably 
discharged on August 30, 1946. 
After his military service, Mr. Brown briefly 
worked for the United States Postal Service in 
Chicago before returning Western New York 
to work at the Bethlehem Steel plant, where 
he was employed for 33 years and rose to the 
rank of foreman. After retirement from the 
plant, Mr. Brown opened a Laundromat at 
2116 Fillmore Avenue in Buffalo. He operated 
the small business, named ‘‘Thrif-T-Wash,’’ 
from 1983 to 2005. 
The Congressional Gold Medal is the high-
est civilian award given by Congress. It is 
awarded to those who have performed an 
achievement that has impacted American his-
tory and culture. Others receiving the medal 
include, but are not limited to: George Wash-
ington in 1776, Rosa Parks in 1999, Pope 
John Paul II in 2000, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King in 2004, the 
Tuskegee Airmen in 2006 and the Victims of 
9/11 in 2011. Mr. Brown will always be re-
membered as a hero alongside others who 
have received this high honor.
