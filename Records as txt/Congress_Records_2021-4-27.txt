The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Gracious God, You are from ever-
lasting to everlasting. Reveal Your 
glory in our Nation and world. Let 
Your light so shine through our Sen-

Holy God, empower us to escape from 
our fragmentary and broken selves into 
the exemplary unity You desire for us

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, Tuesday, April 27, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK, 
a Senator from the State of Georgia, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. WARNOCK thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate will take up a series of 
votes to confirm three highly qualified 
nominees to the Biden administration: 
Jason Miller for Deputy OMB Director, 
Janet McCabe for Deputy EPA Admin-
istrator, and Colin Kahl for Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Policy. 
And then, later this afternoon, the 
Senate will move forward with the 
process to take up the bipartisan water 
infrastructure bill. I expect the Senate 
will do so with significant bipartisan 
support. 
The water infrastructure bill is as 
noncontroversial as it gets. It was ap-
proved by the Environment and Public 
Works Committee on a unanimous con-
sent 
vote—every 
single 
Democrat, 
every single Republican—thanks to the 
good work of Chairman CARPER and 
Ranking Member CAPITO. This water 
infrastructure bill is also a core com-
ponent of the Republican infrastruc-
ture proposal released last week. So I 
hope this legislation will serve as a 
starting point for our two parties to 
collaborate on infrastructure when and 
where we can. At the moment, Sen-
ators Carper, Duckworth, and Cardin 
continue discussions with Republican 
Senators about possible amendments. 
But let me be very clear: The Senate 
must conclude its work on the water 
infrastructure bill before the end of the 
week. 
This is not a controversial bill or a 
complicated new program. In too many 
communities, access to clean, safe, and 
affordable drinking water is not a guar-
antee. Surely, we can all agree that in 
America clean drinking water should 
be a fundamental guarantee. 
The Senate must take first necessary 
steps to invest in communities with 
aging water infrastructure by passing 
this bill, and we must do so this week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2204 
April 27, 2021 
Democrat majority made during the 
first hundred days of the Biden admin-
istration. Thanks primarily to the 
American 
Rescue 
Plan, 
the 
most 
sweeping Federal recovery effort in 
decades, shots are going into arms; 
money is going into people’s pockets; 
and 
businesses, 
schools, 
and 
res-
taurants are starting to reopen. 
Americans 
finally—finally—have 
some reason for hope. Jobs are coming 
back. The economic recovery is accel-
erating, and the pace of vaccinations 
has far exceeded even President Biden’s 
own goals. After one of the most dif-
ficult years in recent memory, the first 
hundred days of the Biden Presidency 
and the new Senate Democratic major-
ity have seen the country turn a cor-
ner. Slowly but surely, we are proving 
to the American people that govern-
ment and the Senate can work for 
them. 
As President Biden prepares to take 
stock of where we have come from and 
where we still need to go, with a joint 
address to Congress, it is worth looking 
back at some of the accomplishments 
of these first 100 days. Among those ac-
complishments is the fact that the 
Senate has confirmed the most diverse 
Cabinet in history, faster than under 
both Presidents Trump and Obama, and 
all of them with bipartisan support. 
Eleven are people of color, and 10 are 
women. Among them, we have a former 
teacher, a former construction worker, 
several former veterans, a small busi-
ness man, even a musician—a far cry 
from the, shall we say, less economi-
cally diverse Cabinet chosen by the 
former President. Now, more than ever 
before, we have a Cabinet that looks 
like America. 
In our Nation’s history, the Treasury 
Secretary has only ever been a White 
man—an unbroken streak of 77 White 
men in a row. This Senate confirmed 
the first woman to serve as Treasury 
Secretary in our history, Janet Yellen. 
The list of firsts goes on: the first Afri-
can American to serve as Defense Sec-
retary, the first Black man to serve as 
EPA Administrator, the first ever in-
digenous American, and the first ever 
openly gay Secretary to lead any Cabi-
net Agency. 
Last week, the Senate confirmed 
Vanita Gupta to Associate Attorney 
General—the first woman of color and 
the first civil rights attorney ever to 
hold that position. 
Last month, Dr. Rachel Levine be-
came the Deputy Secretary of Health 
and Human Services, the first openly 
transgender Federal official in Amer-
ican history. 
Federal Agencies have enormous in-
fluence over the policies that affect the 
day-to-day lives of the American peo-
ple. Whether registering for Social Se-
curity, filing for unemployment or vet-
erans’ benefits, or seeking a small busi-
ness loan, average folks interact with 
these Cabinet Agencies every single 
day, hundreds of thousands, if not mil-
lions, of times. 
Having capable, experienced, and en-
ergetic public servants at the top of 
these Agencies matters, and it matters, 
too, that they come from different 
backgrounds and have lived different 
experiences. By confirming historically 
diverse nominees, we are showing the 
American people that their govern-
ment represents them and that all of 
their voices matter. 
We also know that a Cabinet with di-
verse views will produce policies that 
better reflect the needs of a diverse Na-
tion. 
I am proud of the nominees we have 
confirmed over the first hundred days. 
As we move forward, the Senate will 
continue 
working 
with 
the 
White 
House on confirming nominees and ju-
dicial appointments that reflect the di-
versity and dynamism of our great 
country. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 1364 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand that there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator is correct. 
The clerk will read the bill by title 
for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1364) to provide for the recogni-
tion of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, 
and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceedings. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will now be placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
FENTANYL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as I 
noted here on the floor last week, the 
unaccompanied children packed into 
overflowing facilities are not the only 
tragic consequence of our failure to se-
cure the border. 
In addition to the U.S. mail, our 
southern border is a major source for 
the stream of lethal illegal drugs that 
continue to pour into our country. Ac-
cording to the CDC, more Americans 
died of overdoses last year than ever 
before. 
This health crisis predated COVID–19 
and will outlast it, and Customs and 
Border Protection data tell us a major 
cause has been a spike in the flow of 
fentanyl and its analogs produced by 
chemical companies in places like 
China. These drugs, which can be hun-
dreds of thousands of times stronger 
than morphine, are rightly classified 
on the schedule of controlled sub-
stances. There are severe penalties for 
those caught trafficking them. It is the 
least we can do to protect American 
lives, families, and communities. 
Clearly, on its own, this step hasn’t 
been sufficient, but in a few weeks, 
even this obvious step is set to expire. 
Fentanyl analogs would cease being 
controlled substances in Federal law, 
making enforcement and deterrence 
even more difficult. 
So Congress is faced with what 
should be a crystal-clear choice. The 
right thing to do, of course, is to per-
manently schedule these substances. 
Only in Washington could this become 
some kind of intense debate, but alas, 
some soft-on-crime corners of the po-
litical left have convinced some Demo-
crats that this impending expiration is 
actually, actually a political oppor-
tunity. They want the Democrats to 
only reschedule these analogs for a 
short period of time, punting this dead-
line just a few months into the future, 
which makes you ask, Why? 
Well, so that Democrats could come 
back to the table with an unrelated 
soft-on-crime bill—say, reducing prison 
sentences for drug dealers—and make 
that bad idea the price of admission for 
keeping these deadly poisons illegal. 
So look, we need to be clear-eyed 
here. No amount of political spin or in-
side-the-beltway 
horse 
trading 
can 
muddy the debate. It is very clear: Con-
gress should schedule these fentanyl 
analogs permanently—permanently. 
It is not complicated. Americans are 
dying. Communities are drowning. Chi-
nese drug traffickers are getting rich 
off of our misery. Permanently sched-
uling these analogs is the very least, 
the very least Congress can do. 
f 
NOMINATION OF JANET GARVIN 
MCCABE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, this week the Sen-
ate is set to vote on President Biden’s 
nominee to be Deputy Administrator of 
the EPA. This nominee actually needs 
no introduction for my fellow Kentuck-
ians and our neighbors in coal country. 
But for those less familiar, Janet 
McCabe was the chief author of the 
Clean 
Power 
Plan 
that 
President 
Obama unveiled back in 2015. Well, 6 
years and thousands of coal industry 
jobs later, Ms. McCabe is set to join an 
administration whose job-killing poli-
cies would make the Obama EPA blush. 
Of course, President Biden’s War on 
Coal predates his administration. Back 
in 2008, as a candidate for the Vice 
Presidency, he insisted there would be 
‘‘no coal plants here in America. Build 
them, if they’re going to build them, 
over there,’’ obviously, meaning some 
other country. 
Sadly, this was one area where the 
Obama administration, unfortunately, 
kept its promises. It was a terrible 
time to be a working American whose 
livelihood the Democrats happened to 
dislike. 
But 
our 
new 
President’s 
leftward sprint is set to make these 
bad old days merely the warmup act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2205 
April 27, 2021 
Remember, rejoining the Paris cli-
mate agreement was a day one priority 
for 
this 
administration—this 
unen-
forceable deal whose own signatories 
largely ignored their commitments for 
the past 5 years, the deal that proved 
unable to keep China from signifi-
cantly increasing its greenhouse gas 
emissions and proved unnecessary for 
the United States to decrease our own. 
We decreased our own. 
But despite it all, the administration 
is rushing back in to signal virtue on 
the international stage. Here at home, 
they are rolling out policy after policy 
that would cost American families 
quite dearly. 
The President signed away thousands 
of jobs by canceling the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. The authors of the Green New 
Deal boast about the radical social en-
gineering they have seeded into the ad-
ministration’s 
legislative 
proposals. 
The infrastructure plan they have 
rolled out would pick winners and los-
ers in automotive manufacturing and 
aim to purge the electrical grid of the 
most reliable and affordable forms of 
domestic power. 
Of course, despite it all, carbon emis-
sions don’t respect national bound-
aries, so all the unilateral sacrifices 
this administration is eager to impose 
on blue-collar families won’t make a 
dent in global emissions if our adver-
saries just keep on roaring right past 
us. 
And now the Biden climate team is 
hoping to add a proven veteran from 
the War on Coal. The President cam-
paigned suggesting he wouldn’t owe the 
far left anything, but he is choosing to 
govern like he owes them everything. 
I will oppose the McCabe nomination 
and would urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
f 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, yesterday I dis-
cussed how the Biden administration’s 
wishful thinking has set them up for 
foreign policy failure in Central Asia 
and the Middle East. The likely catas-
trophe in Afghanistan may well con-
sume the administration and distract 
from the challenges proposed by com-
petition with Russia and China. 
The President’s meager defense budg-
et proposal suggests his administration 
isn’t taking strategic competition very 
seriously to begin with. Russia and 
China have spent years—years—invest-
ing heavily in military modernization 
with a specific eye toward threatening 
U.S. forces. We spent the previous ad-
ministration repairing the readiness of 
our forces and beginning to modernize 
after years on the back foot. 
A bipartisan Commission concluded 
we would need sustained increases in 
defense funding to successfully counter 
the growing Russian and Chinese capa-
bilities. Yet adjusting for inflation, 
President 
Biden’s 
proposal 
would 
amount to a reduction in spending. 
This administration has talked tough 
with both these rivals, and I have given 
credit where credit has been due, but 
when the time came to speak in the 
language that Putin and Xi understand 
best—money and power—this White 
House flinched. 
Just last week, Russia reminded us of 
the threat it poses to Europe with a 
massive 
mobilization 
of 
forces 
on 
Ukraine’s border. NATO allies are al-
ready struggling to meet their commit-
ments on collective security. 
So you have to ask, Would declining 
American spending make Putin more 
likely or less likely to think twice next 
time? And what about China? Will 
China be more likely or less likely to 
respect its neighbors’ territorial waters 
if the United States stops contending 
for an edge in naval and long-range ca-
pabilities and lets ourselves fall be-
hind? 
The head of the U.S. Strategic Com-
mand reported last week that both 
Russia and China are modernizing their 
nuclear arsenals faster than the United 
States. He warned that if we fail to 
keep pace, we will be ‘‘at risk of losing 
credibility in the eyes of our adver-
saries.’’ 
Our nuclear triad has preserved the 
peace for decades, but crucial compo-
nents are now decades older than the 
men and women we have operating 
them. If we want to maintain effective 
deterrence, we have to modernize. 
Whether this administration likes it 
or not, we are locked in a race with ad-
versaries who plan literally decades 
ahead. A lack of resolve will compound 
on itself and invite disaster. Surely 
that cannot be the legacy President 
Biden hopes to leave. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

TAX LEGISLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a few 
weeks ago, President Biden introduced 
an infrastructure plan—or at least that 
is what the Democrats are calling it. In 
fact, a substantial portion of this bill 
goes to Democratic priorities that have 
nothing to do with infrastructure, from 
support for Big Labor to a new Civilian 
Climate Corps to advance ‘‘environ-
mental justice.’’ President Biden’s in-
frastructure proposal would cost a lot 
of money, well north of $2 trillion. 
So how does the President plan to 
pay 
for 
this 
legislation? 
Unsurprisingly, the President is pro-
posing tax hikes—notably, a substan-
tial hike in the corporate tax rate. 
There are two sources the Democrats 
like to go to when it comes to paying 
for their spending—corporations and 
prosperous Americans. In fact, the 
Democrats tend to speak about cor-
porations and well-off Americans as if 
they are a bottomless source of funding 
for government programs and as if the 
Democrats can endlessly hike taxes on 
these individuals and businesses with-
out consequences. 
When the Republicans object to the 
prospect of major tax hikes, the Demo-
crats cry that the Republicans are just 
protecting wealthy corporate cronies— 
a deeply ironic charge when you con-
sider that the Democrats want to in-
clude a tax cut for wealthy Democratic 
donors and Hollywood types in this 
same infrastructure package. 
The real reason for the Republicans’ 
concern, of course, is quite different. 
The Republicans are concerned about 
substantial tax hikes on any individual 
or business because we know that tax-
ation has economic consequences. It is 
something that the Democrats should 
know as well—it is basic economics, 
after all—but they don’t seem capable 
of grasping it. Taxation has con-
sequences. 
Tax 
hikes 
have 
con-
sequences, and big tax hikes have big 
consequences, usually negative ones. 
The corporate tax hike the Demo-
crats are talking about will have nega-
tive consequences for American busi-
nesses. That means it will have nega-
tive consequences for American work-
ers, and that is a problem. 
Three years ago, the Republicans 
passed major tax reform legislation. 
Along with substantial tax cuts for 
middle-class Americans, this legisla-
tion cut America’s corporate tax rate. 
Why? Well, at the time we passed this 
legislation, the United States had the 
highest corporate tax rate in the devel-
oped world, plus an outdated inter-
national tax system. Both of those 
things put U.S. businesses at a major 
disadvantage next to their foreign 
counterparts, and they discouraged for-
eign companies from moving to and in-
vesting in the United States. 
Our outdated tax system had also re-
sulted in a wave of inversions. That is 
tax professional-speak for companies 
moving their headquarters overseas. 
According to Bloomberg, between 2004 
and 2016, 36 American-based companies

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2206 
April 27, 2021 
inverted. Needless to say, those inver-
sions resulted in a loss of American 
jobs and domestic investment. A piece 
in the Wall Street Journal reported 
that one accounting firm estimates 
that the United States lost $510 billion 
from cross-border mergers and acquisi-
tions between 2004 and 2016. 
The Republicans knew that if we 
wanted to boost job creation here at 
home and improve opportunities for 
American workers, we needed to ad-
dress the high corporate tax rate and 
put American companies on a more 
competitive footing internationally, so 
we cut the corporate tax rate and 
brought the U.S. international tax sys-
tem into the 21st century by replacing 
our outdated worldwide system with a 
modernized territorial tax system. 
It didn’t take long to see the results: 
Inversions ended. Economic growth 
outstripped predictions. The poverty 
rate dropped. Jobs increased. Incomes 
grew. In fact, income growth in 2019 
was the highest ever recorded, and the 
real median household income for Afri-
can-American, Hispanic, and Asian- 
American workers hit record highs. In 
other words, tax reform worked, and, 
importantly, it worked for the very 
people 
the 
Republicans 
wanted 
to 
help—ordinary Americans. By improv-
ing the tax situation for American 
businesses, we improved the job and in-
come situation for American workers, 
but now the Democrats want to undo 
all of that. 
To pay for their preferred govern-
ment programs, they want to substan-
tially hike the tax rate on American 
corporations—once 
again, 
putting 
American businesses at a substantial 
disadvantage next to their foreign com-
petitors. If the Democrats impose 
President Biden’s suggested tax hike, 
the combined average top tax rate on 
corporations in the United States will 
be higher than that imposed by every 
one of our major trading partners and 
competitors, including China. 
It is difficult to understand why the 
Democrats think it is a good idea to 
put American companies at a disadvan-
tage next to Chinese companies and 
next to British companies, Japanese 
companies, French companies, German 
companies, and the list goes on and on. 
It is especially difficult to understand 
why the Democrats would do this now, 
at the very time our economy is trying 
to recover from the serious hit we took 
from the coronavirus. 
Unfortunately, it has become clear 
that the Democrats are either incapa-
ble of grasping or don’t care about the 
economic consequences of their pro-
posed tax hikes. The Democrats are fix-
ated on imposing a whole host of new 
government programs, and they are 
ready to tax Americans and American 
businesses to pay for them even if ordi-
nary Americans suffer as a result. Pre-
sumably, they think that if ordinary 
Americans start suffering, they can 
just offer them some help through a 
new government program, but I am 
pretty confident that most Americans 
would exchange government assistance 
for the kinds of jobs and incomes that 
free them from having to depend on 
government programs. 
Substantially 
increasing 
the 
cor-
porate tax rate—and I am talking sub-
stantially; what is being talked about 
is a 33-percent increase, so it will be a 
one-third increase in the tax rate—and 
putting American businesses at a dis-
advantage on the global stage is not 
the best way to encourage the creation 
of those kinds of jobs. Hiking the cor-
porate tax rate will have negative con-
sequences for our economy and for 
hard-working Americans. 
It is easy to say ‘‘Tax the corpora-
tions; tax the rich people,’’ but those 
businesses hire American workers. If 
they have to pay more in taxes, they 
have to pay less in wages. What we 
saw, as I mentioned before, was the 
highest wage increases that we have 
seen in decades, particularly for lower 
income Americans. 
But apparently what is being talked 
about with this tax hike is just the be-
ginning. President Biden and his Demo-
cratic colleagues have a lot more gov-
ernment programs they want to push, 
and they have a whole raft of tax hikes 
waiting in the wings to fund them. 
There is a hike in the top individual in-
come tax rate that would hit small 
businesses hard. Most businesses—99 
percent of the businesses in my State 
of South Dakota—are organized as 
passthroughs. That means they pay 
taxes at the individual rate. Those are 
farmers and ranchers and small busi-
ness people across my State. They are 
the people who create the jobs in South 
Dakota. A hike in the top individual 
income tax rate hits every one of those 
small businesses that has an income in 
excess of $400,000. That is money that 
could be used to hire more workers. 
There is a hike in the capital gains tax, 
which would discourage investment 
and decrease the value Americans can 
expect from their 401(k)s, a new death 
tax that would hit middle-class fami-
lies and family farms and businesses, 
and so much more. 
These tax hikes may help the Demo-
crats usher in parts of the socialist fan-
tasy they have been envisioning, but 
they will do nothing to help American 
families gain financial stability and se-
cure good jobs and lasting, rewarding 
careers. Working Americans are the 
ones who will ultimately suffer the 
most from the Democrats’ tax hike 
plans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I like 
to think that infrastructure is in my 
DNA. My father was Jerry Strobel, a 
civil engineer who spent his entire ca-
reer with the Nebraska Department of 
Transportation. Now, that was back 
when it was still called the Department 
of Roads. He eventually became direc-
tor/State engineer and served under 
two different Governors, Kay Orr and 
Ben Nelson, one Republican and one 
Democrat. 
My dad used to take my two brothers 
and me on weekend road trips across 
Nebraska to check up on our infra-
structure—trips that he would call ‘‘in-
spection tours.’’ Many of the photos 
that I have from my childhood are of 
my brothers and me standing on par-
tially finished bridges, in front of bull-
dozers, and next to highways that were 
under various stages of completion. He 
taught me how to drop a plumb line 
and showed me how to handle his sur-
veying equipment. 
Those trips with my dad taught me 
that infrastructure takes a long time 
to plan, it takes a long time to permit, 
and it takes a long time to build. Even 
short stretches of a single highway can 
sometimes—well, it can take years to 
finish. To get the most out of our lim-
ited taxpayer resources, we must con-
dense that process to save both time 
and money. 
I learned that reliable infrastructure 
doesn’t happen by accident, and when I 
was elected to the Nebraska Legisla-
ture, I brought that appreciation with 
me. As chair of the Transportation and 
Telecommunications Committee, I in-
troduced bills like the Nebraska Build 
Act. The new revenue from that bill 
has funded over a dozen important in-
frastructure projects across Nebraska. 
Nebraskans and all Americans know 
what actual infrastructure is. It is 
roads and bridges, but it is also ports 
and airports and railroads and pipe-
lines and waterways and broadband. 
Those things are a core responsibility 
of government. The American people 
also know what infrastructure is not. If 
Congress passes a bill to reform Medi-
care, that is not infrastructure; that is 
healthcare. 
We all know that words don’t change 
their meaning overnight to suit one 
party or the other’s political goals, but 
President Biden seems to think they 
do. He is asking us to support an infra-
structure proposal that could eventu-
ally top $2.7 trillion, which redefines 
that word to mean policies such as cli-
mate research and federally funded 
home or community care services— 
things that have nothing to do with 
what we have traditionally called in-
frastructure. 
Less than 6 percent of the $2.25 tril-
lion that is identified in the Biden pro-
posal would go to roads and bridges. 
Barely 
4 
percent 
would 
go 
to 
broadband, and less than 2 percent is 
for airports. At the same time, hun-
dreds of billions of dollars would be 
funneled to things like housing, Medi-
care, and electric vehicles. 
The President wants to enact tril-
lions of dollars in new taxes to pay for

S2207 
April 27, 2021 
all of this. Proposals being discussed 
include raising the capital gains tax to 
the highest level in history, as well as 
forcing American businesses—and then, 
ultimately, their customers—to pay 
the highest combined corporate tax 
rate in the developed world. Congres-
sional Democrats have also proposed 
getting rid of the estate tax exemption, 
which would make the Federal death 
tax apply to hard-working, middle- 
class families for the first time in dec-
ades. This would hit our small, family 
Main Street businesses and our family 
farms, making it even more difficult to 
pass their life’s work on to their chil-
dren. 
Infrastructure has always been bipar-
tisan, and it has always enjoyed wide-
spread support. I would gladly—I would 
gladly—support a bill that takes our 
very real infrastructure problems seri-
ously, and I told President Biden that 
when I met with him at the White 
House a few weeks ago. But his pro-
posal simply doesn’t do that. The 
President’s plan asks the Senate to 
vote for a policy wish list of priorities 
that no one—no one outside of Wash-
ington, DC’s bubble—has ever dreamed 
of calling infrastructure. 
When it comes to real infrastructure, 
the Senate does have bipartisan roots. 
We passed the FAST Act by a vote of 83 
to 16 under President Obama in 2015. 
We passed an FAA reauthorization 93 
to 6 under President Trump. And the 
Senate unanimously approved water 
development bills and my pipeline safe-
ty bill last year. I see no reason why 
the administration can’t tackle this 
important issue in a bipartisan way 
once again, and the President, who rep-
resented Delaware in the Senate for 
more than 35 years, knows better than 
most that we do this every day. We do 
it on bills like the HAULS Act, which 
I reintroduced in March to provide 
more flexibility to ag and livestock 
haulers and which has won support by 
both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats. 
There is also bipartisan support for my 
bill to establish an online portal for re-
porting blocked railroad crossings. 
My Democratic colleagues and I find 
common ground on infrastructure more 
often than we disagree, and that in-
cludes bills like the Rural Spectrum 
Accessibility Act, which made internet 
access more widely available in rural 
areas. 
History shows that infrastructure is 
a bipartisan issue, and it can be once 
again. But, right now, our friends on 
the other side of the aisle are pushing 
this wish list of priorities for their pro-
gressive agenda and calling it infra-
structure. 
For our part, Senate Republicans 
have made it clear that we are willing 
to work with the President on a bill 
that actually addresses our Nation’s 
ailing infrastructure and makes tar-
geted investments to meet the needs 
that we have. 
We introduced our own framework 
last week. It draws on our past bipar-
tisan successes, like the FAST Act, and 
it 
focuses 
on 
roads 
and 
bridges, 
broadband, and other actual infrastruc-
ture. It matches or raises the funding 
levels in the FAST Act, such as $299 
billion versus $226 billion for roads and 
bridges, and provides nearly twice as 
much funding for transportation safety 
programs and rail and Amtrak grants. 
We have spent enormous amounts of 
money in the last year to deal with 
COVID–19, and Republicans and Demo-
crats both voted for five bills, totaling 
around $4 trillion, to address that very 
real crisis. Another $1.9 trillion passed 
on a partisan basis in January. That is 
$6 trillion of new spending in 1 year—$6 
trillion of new spending in 1 year. That 
level of spending is not sustainable. 
Adding another $2.7 trillion that is in 
the President’s plan to this spending 
that we already have is not sustain-
able. 
Our proposal is clear that funding for 
infrastructure should be fiscally re-
sponsible. It should use existing, prov-
en formula programs as much as pos-
sible, and it should make regulations 
less burdensome. This is what Presi-
dent Biden should be focused on, and I 
hope that he takes us up on our offer. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JASON SCOTT MILLER 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of confirming Jason Scott Mil-
ler to be the Deputy Director for Man-
agement at the Office of Management 
and Budget. 
Mr. Miller has an extensive track 
record of tackling difficult manage-
ment challenges and driving innova-
tion both in government and in the pri-
vate sector. 
OMB is and will continue to be cen-
tral to the administration’s efforts to 
combat the pandemic and spur eco-
nomic activity in communities all 
across our Nation. 
Mr. Miller’s diverse experience and 
commitment to getting results for the 
American people will be an asset to the 
OMB as it takes on these current chal-
lenges and those challenges yet to 
come. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the confirmation of Jason 
Scott Miller as Deputy Director for 
Management at OMB. 
VOTE ON MILLER NOMINATION 
And, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas 
and nays on this nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all cloture time is 
expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Miller nomina-
tion?

NOMINATION OF JANET GARVIN MCCABE 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, we are 
about to vote cloture on Janet McCabe, 
the No. 2 at the EPA, and I vehemently 
oppose her nomination to this position. 
She is the architect of the Clean 
Power Plan that basically racked my 
economy in West Virginia, and she has 
not backed down from that in her testi-
mony. She is very supportive of that 
plan and even more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2208 
April 27, 2021 
Her boss at the EPA at the time was 
Gina McCarthy. Guess where she is 
now—in the White House. She, again, 
will be Janet McCabe’s boss in the 
White House, dictating from there. 
During her time at the EPA before, 
she didn’t listen, she wouldn’t come to 
West 
Virginia, 
and 
she 
basically 
showed very little interest in what 
happens to the people most deeply af-
fected by the policies that she put for-
ward. 
So given her past actions and present 
statements, I cannot support someone 
who would work to destroy a State’s 
economy, such as ours was destroyed, 
and our communities and their liveli-
hoods. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge our colleagues to join me 
in voting for cloture on the nomination 
of Janet McCabe to serve as Deputy 
Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
Running an Agency like the EPA re-
quires that person to work with and 
serve people regardless of their polit-
ical persuasion. Some people strive to 
be bipartisan. Janet McCabe has a 
proven record of being bipartisan. That 
is one of the reasons why nine former 
EPA Deputy Administrators and Ad-
ministrators support her nomination, 
including four Republicans who served 
in the Reagan, the George H.W. and the 
George W. Bush administrations. 
Janet has served as a senior EPA 
manager. She is a pragmatic and a 
good listener. That trait comes in no 
small part from her Hoosier back-
ground and the time that she spent 
with pragmatic people who will do the 
right thing if they understand what is 
needed. That is what Janet McCabe 
will bring with her to the role of Dep-
uty Administrator at EPA, if con-
firmed. I urge my colleagues to join me 
in voting yes on this nomination. 
I yield.

We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the

NOMINATION OF COLIN HACKETT KAHL 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to urge my col-
leagues strongly to vote against the 
nomination of Colin Kahl to serve as 
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. 
That position is the No. 3 position in 
the Department of Defense. 
Last week, Colin Kahl became Presi-
dent Biden’s first nominee not to gar-
ner one single Republican vote on the 
Senate floor. The Vice President had to 
cast the tie-breaking vote. Every other 
nominee, even some of the most par-
tisan progressives, earned at least one 
or some Republican votes. 
What makes this nomination even 
more out of the ordinary is that this 
truly never happens with DOD nomi-
nees. If you look back over the last 
decade, recorded votes on DOD nomi-
nees are rare and only a few times did 
a nominee receive support from fewer 
than two-thirds of the Senate. It just 
doesn’t happen. It happened this time. 
Some of his tweets have raised con-
cerns from a number of our colleagues 
that Dr. Kahl might have shared sen-
sitive or classified information on 
Twitter. The junior Senator from Ten-
nessee highlighted this on the floor 
last week. 
Furthermore, Dr. Kahl’s tweets also 
show a history of volatile behavior 
that goes further than just being high-
ly partisan and unbalanced. He is also 
somewhat of a conspiracy theorist. 
In May of 2018, Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu announced that 
Israel had seized a major nuclear ar-
chive from Iran. That archive has since 
revealed many previously unknown nu-
clear 
sites, 
and 
the 
International 
Atomic Energy Agency is working to 
gain access to inspect these sites 
today, thanks to Israel’s discovery. 
But what did Dr. Kahl say about 
Israel’s discovery at that time? He was 
skeptical, and he added: ‘‘This sure has 
an eerie pre-2003 Iraqi vibe to it.’’ In 
other words, rather than being alarmed 
about the fact that Iran had many 
undeclared nuclear sites, Dr. Kahl al-
leged that Israel was trying to goad 
America into war. 
Somehow, for Dr. Kahl the problem is 
never Iran or the weak 2015 Iran deal 
that didn’t cover the nuclear sites that 
Israel revealed. He wants to give Iran 
massive sanctions relief to return to 
that deal. No, for Dr. Kahl the problem 
is Israel, especially when our Israeli 
friends reveal information about Iran’s 
nefarious behavior. 
Again, this isn’t about a policy dis-
agreement. This is about whether Dr. 
Kahl is someone who can accept facts, 
even when those facts undercut his pol-
icy preferences. 
National security is a bipartisan pri-
ority. It always has been and always

will be. As I said at the beginning of 
this, traditionally, nominees for key 
DOD roles receive bipartisan support in 
the Senate. In fact, I can’t recall a sin-
gle nominee for a top DOD position in 
the past 40 years who didn’t garner at 
least one vote from the other party— 
either party. 
Now, I hope President Biden keeps 
this in mind as he staffs the rest of his 
administration. We need nominees who 
will work with Members on both sides 
of the aisle, and those Members have to 
trust that person in return. Moving for-
ward, I would urge President Biden to 
listen to his own calls for bipartisan-
ship and unity and send us nominees 
who could be approved without con-
troversy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to be able to 
complete my remarks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JANET GARVIN MCCABE 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the 
Senate has invoked cloture, and I just 
want to thank everybody who sup-
ported cloture on Janet McCabe’s nom-
ination to serve as Deputy Adminis-
trator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
I rise now to urge my colleagues to 
support the confirmation of this out-
standing 
nominee, 
because 
Janet 
McCabe is exactly the leader that Ad-
ministrator Michael Regan and the 
rest of the EPA need right now as we 
tackle some of the most pressing chal-
lenges in the Agency and in our Na-
tion’s history. 
She will do so as one who under-
stands the challenges and opportuni-
ties of working as a director of an air 
program, within a State environmental 
agency, to create a safe, healthy, and 
nurturing environment—not just for 
the citizens of some communities but 
for all communities and all ZIP Codes 
in Indiana, but also for the industry 
throughout her State. 
I stand before you today, as my col-
leagues sometimes call me, as a recov-
ering Governor. I understand how dif-
ficult it can be to bring a genuine in-
terest to hear all points of view, to a 
job where Agency actions have con-
sequences in every home and in every 
business. Perhaps Janet McCabe’s col-
league, Fred Cate, vice president of re-
search at the University of Indiana put 
it best in an interview in the IndyStar 
recently. I just want to quote him. 
This is what he said: 
‘‘The reason she will be great at EPA is the 
same reason she was superb here’’. . . . ‘‘It’s 
her ability to get people behind a common 
vision and get them to do things and not just 
talk about them.’’ 
Janet McCabe is a steady hand who 
has built a 30-year career of leadership 
in environmental protection. Her dedi-
cation and her know-how will be in-
valuable in protecting clean air and 
clean water, addressing the climate 
crisis, and realizing environmental jus-
tice for the most vulnerable among us. 
So it is no surprise that she has gar-
nered support from 48 leading environ-
mental organizations. At the same 
time, anyone who has worked with Ms. 
McCabe knows that she is a hard-work-
ing, pragmatic Hoosier to the core. She 
works well with Democrats. She works 
well with Republicans and with Inde-
pendents. And that is why she has the 
public support of nine former EPA Dep-
uty Administrators and Acting Admin-
istrators, including four Republican 
former EPA Deputy Administrators 
who served in the Reagan administra-
tion and who served in the administra-
tion of George Herbert Walker Bush 
and who served in the George W. Bush 
administration. 
Her professional experience includes 
service in both Federal and State gov-
ernment, and that includes impressive 
tenures in both Indiana and Massachu-
setts government agencies, as well as 
years of leadership experience at EPA. 
Based 
on 
that 
experience, 
Ms. 
McCabe knows that in order for any 
Federal Agency to be successful, its 
leaders must work closely and collabo-
ratively with State and local partners, 
no matter which party is in charge. 
Her pragmatic and inclusive style 
has also inspired support of the electric 
power industry. The Edison Electric In-
stitute, which represents all U.S. inves-
tor-owned electric companies, enthu-
siastically supports Janet McCabe’s 
nomination. This is an organization— 
listen to this—that speaks for compa-
nies that provide power to 220 million 
Americans. That is right—roughly two- 
thirds of all Americans. 
Let me put it another way. Edison 
Electric Institute’s members generate 
electricity for two-thirds of all Ameri-
cans, and they have thrown their sup-
port behind the nomination of Janet 
McCabe for this post. 
According to EEI president Tom 
Kuhn, he says Janet McCabe ‘‘has a 
strong commitment to public service 
and a solid track record of engaging 
with diverse stakeholders, including in-
dustry, as demonstrated by her time at 
the helm of both the Air Program at 
the Indiana Department of Environ-
mental Management and EPA’s Office 
of Air and Radiation.’’ 
That is a quote. 
Ms. McCabe has their support be-
cause she has demonstrated time and 
again that environmental and eco-
nomic progress go hand in hand. Let 
me say that again. She demonstrated 
time and again that cleaner air, clean 
water, environmental progress, and 
economic progress go hand in hand. 
They are inextricably linked. That 
ethic has earned Ms. McCabe the sup-
port of the American Chemistry Coun-
cil, the Association of Equipment Man-
ufacturers, and the BlueGreen Alli-
ance, which represents some of our 
largest labor unions. 
Ms. McCabe knows that while work-
ing to protect clean air and clean water 
and address climate change, the Agen-
cy must seize the opportunity to pro-
tect and create good-paying jobs across 
our country. She understands that the 
environmental and climate challenges 
we face are not just a problem. They 
offer economic and competitive oppor-
tunity. 
President 
Biden’s 
American 
Jobs 
Plan embraces these principles, and 
Janet McCabe has the experience and 
she has the intelligence to work with 
her Agency colleagues to translate 
them into action at EPA. President 
Biden’s American Jobs Plan embraces 
these principles, and Janet McCabe has 
the experience and the intelligence to 
work with her Agency colleagues to 
translate them into action at EPA. 
The Association of Equipment Manu-
facturers put it very well when they 
wrote last month, and this is their 
quote: 
Ms. McCabe will bring the leadership and 
collaborative spirit needed to address dif-
ficult environmental challenges and improve 
regulatory processes, and ensure we can con-
tinue to build, power, and feed our country 
in an innovative and sustainable way. 
Ms. McCabe will help ensure that ev-
eryone—everyone who has a stake in 
our environment and our economy— 
has a seat at the table. She has built a 
reputation of listening to everyone— 
everyone—addressing 
real 
economic 
concerns, making sure government pol-
icy helps people and communities at 
the local level. 
Ms. McCabe embodies these values in 
her current role as director of Indiana 
University’s 
Resilience 
Institute, 
where she works every day to help 
mayors and to help farmers and com-
munities of all sizes and shapes prepare 
for and adapt to climate change. 
I will borrow once again from Janet 
McCabe’s colleague from the Univer-
sity of Indiana, Fred Cate, who said of 
her career success, and I quote him 
again: 
‘‘She understands that at the end of the 
day, if you don’t bring along finance and in-
dustry and local buy-in, then we won’t get 
things done.’’ 
I couldn’t have said it better. 
As Deputy Administrator, Janet’s 
role will be the equivalent of a chief 
operating officer. She will be primarily 
focused on EPA internal policies and 
procedures—the day-to-day running of 
the Agency—and will not play a signifi-
cant role in crafting new public poli-
cies. 
One of her key tasks will be to re-
store 
the 
Agency’s 
organizational 
health, which suffered during the pre-
vious administration, as respect for 
science and career staff advice declined 
and morale deteriorated. There is no 
person better suited to overseeing this 
internal 
restoration 
than 
Janet 
McCabe. Under her leadership I have 
every confidence that EPA will recover 
and soar. 
I am very grateful that Janet has 
agreed to serve her country again in 
this new leadership role, and I am 
grateful to her family for their willing-
ness to share her again with all of us.

Her personal integrity and work ethic 
is an inspiration to all public servants, 
and her willingness to engage all points 
of view is a boon to all who have strong 
interest in EPA’s work. 
So in closing, I want to urge my col-
leagues—all of our colleagues—to vote 
to confirm her today so that she can 
put her robust talents to work for all 
the American people.

DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. 
CARDIN. 
Madam 
President, 
shortly, we are going to be taking up S. 
914, the Drinking Water and Waste-
water Infrastructure Act, and I would 
urge my colleagues to approve this leg-
islation promptly. 
The Environment and Public Works 
Committee reported this legislation by 
a unanimous vote. We don’t get too 
many unanimous votes here on sub-
stantive, important legislation, and we 
were able to get that because this bill 
is truly bipartisan. 
I want to congratulate the leadership 
of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, Chairman CARPER, for the 
management of the committee to bring 
us together, and Senator CAPITO, the 
ranking Republican member. The two 
of them set the climate for us to work 
together to bring out a drinking water 
and wastewater infrastructure bill. I 
also want to compliment my counter-
part in regards to the Subcommittee 
on Infrastructure, Senator CRAMER, 
who is the ranking member—I am the 
chair—and Senator DUCKWORTH, who is 
the chair of the Water Subcommittee, 
and Senator LUMMIS. All six of us 
worked together so that this Drinking 
Water and Wastewater Infrastructure 
Act really does represent the views of 
all the Members of the Senate, and it is 
a bill that is desperately needed by our 
communities. 
Water infrastructure is critically im-
portant to our Nation. It is important 
for drinking water. It is important for 
how we treat our waste, wastewater. 
The needs are tremendous. The Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers gives us 
a report card grade of D in 2021. The 
gaps are billions of dollars a year nec-
essary to bring our water infrastruc-
ture up to standard. 
This legislation will move us in the 
right direction. It authorizes $35 billion 
of water infrastructure, which is des-
perately needed in our communities. It 
will allow us to upgrade aging infra-
structure, address the threat of climate

change, invest in new technologies, and 
help marginal communities in dealing 
with these needs. 
COVID–19 has made the challenges 
even more dramatic for our commu-
nities. Water utilities have incurred 
additional costs. I think that is quite 
obvious. They had to deal with the pro-
tective equipment for their workers to 
deal with COVID–19. They had workers 
who were out as a result of COVID–19. 
They had to deal with changing the 
way 
they 
operated 
their 
business. 
There was a demand for greater water 
during COVID–19, just the washing of 
our hands frequently. It requires us to 
have access to more clean water. 
The ability of our customers to pay 
their 
bills 
was 
challenged 
during 
COVID–19. As we know, American fami-
lies’ incomes were very stressed and 
are still stressed as a result of COVID– 
19. The gap between the ability of the 
public support for water infrastructure 
and what ratepayers are asked to pay 
is getting larger and larger. We haven’t 
made the money available from the 
public side for water infrastructure, 
and to put more pressure on the rate 
when customers are already having a 
difficult time paying their bills is not a 
viable option. That makes S. 914 even 
more urgent. 
I want to talk about a couple provi-
sions that are included in S. 914 that 
are bipartisan that I worked on that I 
think are extremely important parts of 
this legislation. 
One, working with Senator WICKER, 
we have in this bill a pilot program 
that will establish 40 grants around the 
Nation so that we can establish pro-
grams to help low-income households. 
By way of comparison, this is similar 
to the LIHEAP program that we use to 
help our low-income families deal with 
their utility bills for heating their 
homes 
and 
air-conditioning 
their 
homes. This will provide similar help 
for low-income families in dealing with 
the price of their water bills. 
Having been through Maryland and 
some of our centers, I can tell you that 
there are many communities where in-
dividuals literally cannot afford their 
water bills. It is an essential utility. 
We need to do something to fill the 
gap. So this bill will establish a pro-
gram so that we can take some of the 
pressure off of the ratepayers and 
therefore allow local utilities to be 
able to use rates to do some of their 
improvements without adversely af-
fecting low-income families. This pilot 
program, to me, is long overdue, but I 
am pleased to see it is included in this 
legislation. 
Another provision that is included in 
this legislation is legislation that I 
have authored with Senator CAPITO, 
the Clean Water Infrastructure Resil-
iency and Sustainability Program. The 
two of us recognize that in the State of 
West Virginia and the State of Mary-
land, we have extreme weather events 
that are affecting our ability to handle 
drinking water and wastewater. That is 
true in every State in the Nation. I 
could tell you about Maryland and the 
community of Ellicott City, where 
they have had two 100-year floods in a 
period of less than 2 years. 
These 
frequent, 
extreme 
weather 
events are happening in this Nation on 
a regular basis, and it is putting addi-
tional stress on our water infrastruc-
ture. The President had a recent sum-
mit on climate, and this is one of the 
issues that were brought up. 
Wastewater treatment plants and 
drinking water systems—we need to in-
crease their resiliency and add that 
ability. That is what this provision will 
do by providing grants that will assist 
in planning, designing, construction, 
implementation, operation, or mainte-
nance of the facilities. 
Stormwater runoff is one of the larg-
est sources of pollutants in our envi-
ronment. We have over 600,000 miles of 
rivers and streams in America, 13 mil-
lion acres of lakes, reservoirs, and 
ponds. I can speak personally about the 
impact that runoff has on the Chesa-
peake Bay, a national treasure. The 
fastest growing source of pollutant 
into the Chesapeake Bay comes from 
storm runoff. 
This grant program on resiliency will 
help all of us plan for how we deal with 
water infrastructure in a way that can 
deal with our modern challenges. 
Another provision in this bill comes 
from legislation that was authored by 
Senator 
BOOZMAN
and 
myself, 
the 
Water 
Resources 
Research 
Amend-
ments Act. This provides help for re-
search so that we can find effective and 
efficient new ways to deal with water 
treatment facilities. 
In Maryland, we are proud that we 
have the Maryland Water Resources 
Research Center at the University of 
Maryland, College Park, that does this 
type of research that will help us to 
the next generation of how we can use 
technology to help deal with our water 
infrastructure in America. 
The bottom line is that S. 914 is a bill 
that will help us preserve and provide 
drinking water to the people of this 
Nation and deal with wastewater. It is 
a very important bill for water infra-
structure. It is bipartisan. It will be on 
the floor. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bipartisan legislation, which 
is clearly part of building America 
back better. I hope we can act on this 
bill this week and send to it the House 
and get this bill to the President for 
his signature. I can tell you, our local 
water systems desperately need the 
help. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Arizona. 
PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a bipartisan Senate 
resolution recognizing the thousands of 
Arizonans and millions more across 
America who go to work every day to 
serve their fellow citizens, protect our 
communities, and make our country a 
stronger place. 
America’s 
public 
servants 
work 
across our uniformed services, as well 
as in Federal, State, and local govern-
ments, to advance our country’s health 
and safety. If we ever needed a re-
minder of the importance of our public 
servants, the past year has provided 
one. Throughout the coronavirus pan-
demic and resulting economic down-
turn, public servants kept us safe, pro-
vided care for our heroes, coordinated 
urgent medical supplies for our com-
munities, and helped keep our small 
businesses open. 
Along our borders with Mexico and 
Canada, Border Patrol agents tackled 
challenging conditions to provide secu-
rity, limit the spread of COVID–19, and 
protect our communities from criminal 
activity. At ports of entry, Customs of-
ficers worked to maintain cross-border 
trade and commerce to keep fueling 
American jobs. 
VA employees cared for our veterans 
and are playing a critical role in deliv-
ering vaccines to veterans, veterans’ 
spouses, and caregivers and depend-
ents. 
Postal employees continued to de-
liver the mail, keeping everyday fami-
lies connected and helping employers 
remain open. 
To all of our firefighters, police offi-
cers, public health officials, and teach-
ers, you deserve our thanks every day, 
but moments of crisis often help to re-
mind us how much we rely on all of 
you. 
When Kingman, AZ, recently experi-
enced a cyber attack, it was local offi-
cials, alongside members of the Na-
tional Guard, who mobilized to contain 
the damage and get the city back on-
line. 
Through these moments of sacrifice 
and service, these men and women 
show that public service is not about 
winning partisan political battles or 
getting your fame out on cable news. It 
is about serving a cause greater than 
ourselves. 
In Arizona we are no strangers to 
dedicated public servants who left their 
marks on our State and country—from 
Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman 
to lead the Arizona State Senate and 
to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, to my personal hero, Senator 
John McCain, who dedicated his life to 
public service, both in uniform and 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
Beginning this Sunday, America will 
mark 
Public 
Service 
Recognition 
Week, and I am honored to again intro-
duce this year’s bipartisan Public Serv-
ice Recognition Week resolution with 
my friend Senator LANKFORD of Okla-
homa. 
On the Subcommittee on Govern-
ment Operations and Border Manage-
ment, Senator LANKFORD and I work 
closely together to strengthen Ameri-
cans’ confidence in our government by 
making the government work better 
for everyday Americans. That is a goal 
we share with all of America’s public 
servants, and I am proud that last year 
the Senate came together across party 
lines to approve our resolution and 
honor public service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2212 
April 27, 2021 
Our bipartisan resolution recognizes 
the crucial work of Federal, State, and 
local employees and public servants 
across the country, and it particularly 
recognizes the work of the millions of 
public servants who have overcome the 
challenges of the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
As Senator LANKFORD has often said 
to 
our 
country’s 
public 
servants, 
‘‘America could not succeed without 
you.’’ 
Public service is a noble calling, and 
millions answer that call every day, 
often underpaid and underappreciated. 
I am honored to thank these employees 
for keeping our communities and our 
Nation safe and secure, and for serving 
as examples to the next generation of 
public servants who will continue their 
legacy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
METHANE 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, in Colo-
rado we have come out of one of the 
worst wildfire seasons that we have 
ever seen. In fact, you can’t really call 
it a season, I think, when the fires are 
still going on when the snow falls, but 
that is what happened this year, in-
credibly. 
Three of the largest fires in our his-
tory all happened in the same year, and 
these fires displaced thousands of peo-
ple in my State. They obscured the 
views of the mountains for weeks at a 
time. They forced families to pack 
their entire lives into duffle bags while 
their homes went up in flames. They 
shut down major highways for weeks 
and paralyzed local economies and 
blanketed 
our 
communities 
with 
smoke. 
If you ask anyone in Colorado why 
this is happening, they will tell you it 
is because our State is becoming hotter 
and drier each year. If you ask farmers 
and ranchers in Colorado—and a lot of 
them are Republican—they will tell 
you they are facing drought that is 
longer and more intense than their par-
ents or grandparents ever had to deal 
with. 
Our mountain towns will tell you 
that they are struggling with ski sea-
sons that are growing shorter each 
year. Our water officials will tell you 
that they are planning for a future 
with a lot less water to go around, and 
there wasn’t enough water to begin 
with. And the reason for all of this is 
climate change. 
That is why in Colorado, a purple 
State, a swing State in the middle of 
the country, there is absolutely a con-
sensus that we have a moral responsi-
bility to deal with climate change as a 
threat to our economy, to our environ-
ment, and to our way of life. 
That responsibility extends to the 
U.S. Senate, but for most of the time I 
have been here, we have treated cli-
mate change like it was going to some-
how solve itself or, in some cases, that 
it didn’t even really exist. And nothing 
could be further from the truth. This is 
a problem for all 50 States and every 
American. It is a problem for human-
ity, and we can’t deal with it in an en-
during way unless the hundred people 
in this body take action, until a hun-
dred people here are willing to lead on 
a challenge that is existential, yes, and 
also global, yes, and is crying out for 
the leadership of the Senate. 
There is nobody else to ride to the 
rescue. We have to do this, and we can 
start tomorrow by voting to reverse— 
and I hope it will be a big bipartisan 
vote tomorrow on voting to reverse— 
the 
last 
administration’s 
terrible, 
counterproductive, self-destructive pol-
icy on methane pollution. 
Methane is not something people 
ever think about, and it is one of the 
most powerful greenhouse gases behind 
climate change. It can be over 80 times 
more potent than carbon dioxide, and 
it is responsible for a quarter of all the 
warming that the planet has seen since 
the Industrial Revolution. 
Today, one of the biggest sources of 
methane pollution is the oil and gas in-
dustry in my State and in the great 
State of Texas, where the senior Sen-
ator is from, and all across the coun-
try, where methane leaks into the at-
mosphere from old pipes, broken vents, 
and outdated practices like burning ex-
cess gas. 
Methane pollution is terrible for the 
environment because it accelerates cli-
mate change. It is terrible for our 
health because it puts toxins in the air 
we breathe, especially for the nearly 10 
million Americans who live near oil 
and gas wells or go to school near oil 
and gas wells. It is also terrible for in-
dustry because it makes their fuel 
much dirtier and it cuts into their bot-
tom line. 
That is why, years ago—I think it 
was 2014—in Colorado, under the lead-
ership of then-Governor Hickenlooper, 
now Senator HICKENLOOPER, we adopt-
ed as a State the country’s first-ever 
rules to limit methane pollution for oil 
and 
gas 
facilities. 
Governor 
Hickenlooper worked by bringing envi-
ronmentalists and industry leaders to-
gether to craft a policy that reflected 
the consensus in my State around cli-
mate change and our economy. Our ap-
proach worked so well that the EPA 
and the Bureau of Land Management 
drew on it for methane rules at the 
Federal level. 
When the last administration went 
after the rules at BLM, our late friend 
Senator John McCain led a bipartisan 
majority in this body to keep them in 
place. At the time, the Trump adminis-
tration claimed that the Federal meth-
ane rules destroyed energy production 
and killed jobs. That was never true, to 
be polite about it. 
In Colorado, our natural gas produc-
tion has grown. Our oil production has 
nearly doubled. Our innovation and 
jobs have increased. Today, there are 52 
different businesses in my State hiring 
people to repair pipes, to track pollu-
tion, and to develop new technologies 
to reduce pollution. This has strength-
ened our economy. 
Colorado’s approach worked so well 
that we have gone back and strength-
ened—strengthened—our methane rules 
another three times in 2017, in 2019, and 
2020, each time with support from both 
environmental groups and industry. 
But instead of learning from our ex-
ample, the Trump administration went 
ahead with its plans to dismantle 
methane rules at the Federal level, and 
it did that over the objection of leading 
oil and gas operators in my State and 
across the country. And the result was 
a self-inflicted wound on our economy 
and our environment, and it com-
promised our leadership in the world. 
Now I hope we will pick up the pieces 
in a bipartisan way, because here is 
what I think: We are not going to solve 
climate change until we have an Amer-
ican climate policy, just like we once 
had something we called U.S. foreign 
policy, where every President who was 
elected, whether they were Republican 
or Democrat, they roughly knew what 
their job was with respect to the Soviet 
Union, with respect to the trans-
atlantic 
alliance. 
There 
were 
dif-
ferences, of course, and we made lots of 
mistakes with that organizing prin-
ciple, but it was an important orga-
nizing principle—that thing we called 
American foreign policy. 
And we are going to need something 
called American climate policy. We 
didn’t win the Cold War 2 years at a 
time, and we can’t accept the politics 
in here, where I put in my ideas for 
healthcare and 2 years later they get 
ripped out, and we put in somebody’s 
ideas for infrastructure and 2 years 
later they get ripped out. We can’t tol-
erate it for those things—for edu-
cation, for taxes. People want predict-
ability. They don’t want us to succumb 
to the political antics of Washington, 
DC, and this floor. 
But when it comes to climate change, 
that is really true, because we can’t fix 
it 2 years at a time. I often hear people 
say that we have to act urgently on cli-
mate change. We do. It is true. But we 
also need a solution that is durable— 
one that will last through changes in 
the majorities in the Congress and 
changes with who is in the White 
House, so that we can actually pass off 
that durable solution to our kids and 
grandkids, who can then pick up the 
baton. 
So let me say this. You cannot ac-
cept, if you want to fix climate change, 
the broken politics that we have here. 
We can’t accept the rubble that we 
sometimes have here. We have to do 
better, and I think we can. I think by 
starting with this methane rule—and 
hopefully doing it in a bipartisan way— 
it will be a great beginning. 
Coming together on methane pollu-
tion is the perfect place to start. In 
Colorado, 91 percent of the people sup-
port limits on methane pollution. It 
has 
the 
support 
of 
environmental 
groups and industry, as I said earlier, 
including America’s largest natural gas 
producers. It has a record of bipartisan 
support in this body, and it has the po-
tential to create thousands of jobs—

high-paying 
jobs—mostly 
in 
rural 
areas, where people are reasonably con-
cerned about what this energy transi-
tion is going to mean for them. Let’s 
pay people to capture methane, to 
make the industry viable, to make the 
product less harmful, and to create 
high-paying jobs in rural areas in 
America that need them. 
I know I don’t have all the answers 
for how to build a durable climate pol-
icy in America, but I know that a sen-
sible approach to methane has to be 
part of the solution, and that approach 
has to address not only new oil and gas 
facilities but existing ones like we 
have done in Colorado, and that is 
what this resolution will do. It will re-
store EPA’s obligation to regulate all 
sources of methane emissions, includ-
ing existing oil and gas operations, 
where there are hundreds of thousands 
of older wells that are responsible for 
75 percent of methane emissions from 
the industry. 
It will help us protect the environ-
ment and create jobs, and it will show 
the world that America can come to-
gether and that this Senate can come 
together in a bipartisan way to deal 
with climate change because, when I 
think about it, I don’t want any of us 
to come back to this floor 10 years 
from now or 20 years from now and de-
scribe how we have just gone through 
the worst wildfire season ever or the 
worst 
hurricane 
season 
ever—more 
likely in the Presiding Officer’s State 
than 
in 
my 
State—or 
the 
worst 
drought in our history. 
I want them to come back and cele-
brate how America led the world to 
overcome the climate threat. I want 
them to praise the era of innovation 
and job creation unleashed across the 
country, and I want them to point out 
what we did in this Congress with this 
vote to put America on a path to pro-
tect our planet, grow our economy, and 
fulfill our responsibility to our kids 
and our grandkids. 
So I urge my colleagues, every single 
one of them, to cast a vote for this im-
portant methane policy and to set us 
on the bipartisan course we need to 
create if we are going to have durable 
climate change policy in this country 
and if America is going to lead the 
world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tomor-
row evening, across the Capitol, Presi-
dent Biden will deliver his first State 
of the Union Address. As we continue 
to make headway in our fight against 
COVID–19, I expect the President to re-
flect on the tremendous progress we 
have made and encourage Americans to 
get vaccinated. So far so good. 
But I also believe he will try to frame 
the nearly $2 trillion partisan bill that 
was rammed through Congress earlier 
this year as the driving force behind 
that progress, even though less than 10 
percent of the bill was related to 
COVID–19. 
I expect the President will call on 
Congress to pass his so-called infra-
structure bill, which is similar to the 
COVID–19 relief bill in that it is a par-
tisan bill having very little to do with 
the title of the bill itself. Only about 5 
percent, in fact, goes toward roads and 
bridges, something we would all define 
as infrastructure. 
I am hopeful that the President will 
finally announce a plan to address the 
crisis at our southern border because, 
so far, the administration has been 
largely silent. The crisis at the south-
ern border is real; it is big; and it is 
growing. We are breaking all the wrong 
kinds of records, including the numbers 
of 
unaccompanied 
children, 
total 
monthly border crossings, and the ca-
pacity levels at our care facilities. 
In March, we saw the highest number 
of border crossings on record, more 
than 172,000 individuals. That was a 
dramatic increase from the already 
eye-popping 100,000 in February—Feb-
ruary, 100,000; March, 172,000; and, trust 
me, it is going to get nothing but 
worse. 
Nearly 19,000 of these individuals 
were 
unaccompanied 
children, 
the 
highest numbers we have ever seen in a 
single month. Sometimes people will 
say: That child came to America all by 
himself or herself. I want to disabuse 
my colleagues of any notion that a 
child—small child—would make that 
trip to the United States ‘‘by them-
selves.’’ 
These 
children 
are 
being 
turned over to criminal organizations 
that are paid by the head to transport 
them from their country of origin into 
the United States and, unfortunately, 
these human smugglers, known in my 
part of the country as ‘‘coyotes,’’ care 
nothing for the welfare of those chil-
dren. It is only the money that they 
could produce by transporting them to 
the United States that they care about. 
It is true we know that a spike in mi-
gration is not an entirely new phe-
nomena and, sadly, neither is the dra-
matic increase in the number of chil-
dren, but the current surge is unlike 
any we have experienced in at least the 
last 20 years, according to Director 
Mayorkas. 
These eye-popping numbers are com-
pounded by a deadly pandemic. We 
have never seen that before. The pan-
demic, of course, has made once rou-
tine tasks like transporting and caring 
for migrants incredibly dangerous to 
the men and women who are per-
forming those duties. 
In an effort to downplay the serious-
ness of the border crisis or to defer at-
tention from it altogether, the admin-
istration has spent literally no time 
talking about it, especially when com-
pared to the time and energy that it 
has dedicated to things like climate 
change. 
In fact, the Biden administration has 
spent the first several weeks of the 
surge denying that there is anything 
wrong at the border. Then they came 
up with some creative euphemisms to 
describe what has happened. They 
called it a challenge. They called it a 
situation. They called it a mess. Well, 
as long as you didn’t call it a crisis, 
they didn’t seem too bothered by it. 
A month ago, the President tapped 
the Vice President to lead efforts to ad-
dress this crisis, which I thought was a 
positive sign, until I realized Vice 
President HARRIS acted as though the 
President had handed her a hand gre-
nade and had pulled the pin because 
she couldn’t get away from it fast 
enough, saying the next day that, well, 
her job is purely diplomatic in nature. 
She hasn’t made a single trip to the 
border and, apparently, does not plan 
to do so at all. 
The President has given lip service to 
encouraging migrants not to come, but 
those 
statements 
mean 
absolutely 
nothing when all of the other signals 
being sent by this administration are: 
There is a green light and a welcome 
mat out for migrants to come to the 
United States. 
The situation is such that we are 
reaching a breaking point, and the Vice 
President and President could recog-
nize that if they took the time to look 
and to learn from the very same people 
I have learned from, the experts who do 
these terribly difficult jobs along the 
border. 
As you can imagine, I have spent a 
lot of time listening to those folks be-
cause I represent them. They are my 
constituents. I visited border commu-
nities and heard from the Border Pa-
trol officers, mayors, county judges, 
and NGOs, nongovernmental organiza-
tions, that are doing the best they can 
dealing with overwhelming numbers. 
I had the opportunity to actually 
talk to some of the migrants them-
selves about their journeys to our bor-
der and what brought them here. In the 
Rio Grande Valley, I spoke with three 
young mothers holding their crying in-
fants less than a mile from the river 
they crossed into the United States. 
They had just undergone preliminary 
health screenings and were waiting for 
a bus to take them to a processing cen-
ter. 
And, please, our colleagues should 
understand these migrants are not try-
ing to get away from the Border Pa-
trol. They are literally walking up to 
the Border Patrol and turning them-
selves in because they realize that is 
the next step to their being placed into 
the interior of the United States and 
completing their journey. 
Of course, as you can imagine, each 
of these mothers was hopeful. They 
made it to the United States and knew 
that as a family unit with young chil-
dren they would be cared for by our 
government and then released into the 
interior of the United States. One of 
the mothers paid $3,600, she said, to get 
here. Another paid $6,000. This is big 
business for the smugglers and the 
criminal 
organizations 
that 
charge 
thousands of dollars to bring migrants 
to the U.S. border. 
I think it is important to note that 
this is not just a Mexico-Central Amer-
ican phenomena. A couple of months

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2214 
April 27, 2021 
ago, when I was down at the Del Rio 
sector of the Border Patrol, the Border 
Patrol Chief showed us a slide with the 
names of 54 different countries rep-
resented by the people who were de-
tained coming across the Del Rio sec-
tor just so far this year—54 different 
countries. 
As I said, many of these ‘‘customers’’ 
are children traveling with no parents. 
We know the journey is not a safe or 
easy one. In fact, it is dangerous, and it 
is hard, and many children arrive in 
critical health, having endured days, 
weeks, and months on the road. And 
the tragic fact is, some of these chil-
dren don’t make it. They die en route. 
I have heard horrific stories of phys-
ical and sexual abuse that occurs at 
the hands of the criminals, cartels, and 
human smugglers, and others traveling 
in a large caravan of immigrants. At 
the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention 
Center in Dallas, which is now serving 
as a shelter for migrant boys, I talked 
to one young man who endured a 3- 
month-long trek on foot from Central 
America to the United States. He told 
us he slept in the jungles along the way 
and that food was scarce. As you can 
imagine, he was happy now to be in a 
shelter receiving three square meals a 
day with a roof over his head. 
These stories are not unique. Many of 
us have seen the heartbreaking video of 
a young boy abandoned by smugglers 
in the Rio Grande Valley, dropped from 
the top of the wall into the interior of 
the United States. And we have read 
the story about a young girl who 
drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande 
River. And we have seen where the 
smugglers who care so little for the 
welfare of the people they are smug-
gling into the United States—and in 
one instance they threw a 6-month-old 
child into the river, knowing the Bor-
der Patrol would be diverted in order 
to save the child, which thankfully 
they did, while they skedaddled into 
the United States. 
I think it is heartbreaking that these 
children are enduring this sort of trau-
ma, and it is infuriating that cartels 
and criminal organizations are getting 
richer in the process. 
So make no mistake, there is a crisis 
at the border and the policies of the 
Biden administration helped make it 
worse. Despite warnings from folks on 
both sides of the aisle, the administra-
tion revoked policies of the previous 
administration 
without 
any 
alter-
native plan in its place. Making mat-
ters worse, they entirely failed to pre-
pare for the obvious consequences. Now 
the question is, What are they going to 
do to address it? 
I believe the American people deserve 
to hear from President Biden his out-
line of a plan to address the border cri-
sis and to manage this surge of human-
ity in a fair and humane way. If the 
President is still working on that por-
tion of the speech, I would like to 
make a friendly suggestion. 
There is a grassroots plan out there 
that was built from bottom up by the 
Senators and Congressmen most famil-
iar with the crisis. It includes input 
from the men and women who dealt 
with migration surges in the past and 
who are working around-the-clock to 
manage the consequences of uncon-
trolled movement of migrants across 
the border now. It is called the Bipar-
tisan Border Solutions Act. 
Senator SINEMA from Arizona, who 
also represents a border State, and I 
have introduced this legislation here in 
the Senate. We are proud to work with 
two Texans, one Republican and one 
Democrat, HENRY CUELLAR of Laredo 
and TONY GONZALES, a Republican in 
the 23rd Congressional District. He rep-
resents, I believe, the largest single 
section of the U.S.-Mexico border of 
any Member in Congress. Our bill seeks 
to address the most urgent problems on 
the border today. There is more we can 
and should do, but at least this would 
address the most urgent problems. 
First, it would establish four regional 
processing centers to streamline the 
processing of migrants. Right now, the 
smugglers know that if they flood the 
zone with children, the Border Patrol 
are going to have to go off the frontline 
in order to take care of the children, 
leaving it wide open for smuggling nar-
cotics and other migrants—narcotics 
which, by the way, contributed to 
roughly 88,000 drug overdoses in Amer-
ica alone in the last 12 months. 
Our bill would provide protections for 
migrant children who come into the 
country without a parent or any rel-
atives. 
It would help reduce the immigration 
court backlog and remove a major pull 
factor for migrants who do not have a 
legitimate asylum claim. But it would, 
more importantly, speed up the process 
for the most vulnerable migrants who 
do have a valid asylum claim. 
I think these are commonsense re-
forms that should earn the support of 
Members from both parties in both 
Chambers in Congress, as well as a 
number of respected outside organiza-
tions. 
We would be glad to receive the sup-
port of the administration or at least a 
phone call so we can begin conversa-
tions. Ignoring this crisis will not 
make it go away. We have spent the 
last couple of months demonstrating 
that inaction will only make it worse. 
As I said, we have seen surges in the 
past but never like this. The busiest 
months are usually April, May, and 
June, not February and March, which 
indicates, by historical trends, it is 
going to get worse and worse and 
worse. If our facilities and our per-
sonnel are overwhelmed today, which 
they are, and we haven’t yet reached 
the normal busy season, how much 
worse are things going to get? How 
many more children will die in the 
hands of these criminals on their way 
to the United States before we decide 
to take action? 
As the Presiding Officer and I have 
discussed before, there is nobody else 
to solve these problems except us. On 
something as important as this, it 
seems like a logical area for Repub-
licans and Democrats to work together 
to try to take at least some modest 
steps to address this crisis. I hope the 
President will work with us and be part 
of the solution and not part of the 
problem. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was lis-
tening intently to the Senator from 
Texas, who is certainly familiar with 
the problems on the border. It happens 
that I spent 30 years down there as a 
builder and developer many years ago. 
I got to know the border people. They 
are trying to do a great job down there 
against some pretty impossible odds. 
You know, one thing I always think 
about is, it has nothing to do with Cen-
tral American citizens or Mexicans; it 
is the people from the Middle East, ter-
rorists from all over. Open borders 
don’t work. So I applaud him for his ef-
forts on that. 
DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, this week we have a 
real opportunity before us to pass the 
bipartisan Drinking Water and Waste-
water Infrastructure Act of 2021. 
If you listen only to the national 
media, you would think that Congress 
can’t get together on much of any-
thing, but this bill is a real example of 
how that is not always the case. The 
reason is simple: Everyone agrees that 
we need clean, safe, drinking water and 
to support State and local projects to 
protect water quality. 
There are tangible benefits for com-
munities too. Just consider what the 
bill does for my State of Oklahoma. 
First, it will increase the Federal fund-
ing for local projects by over $315 mil-
lion in the next 5 years, an increase of 
123 percent. 
More than that, the State retains the 
control to direct funds to projects they 
have identified. It is called local sup-
port. It is kind of a unique concept. It 
demonstrates clearly that we who are 
representing an area know more about 
the area than people who don’t rep-
resent the area. 
This will increase funding for local 
projects. It will also provide needed re-
sources to help Oklahoma achieve its 
comprehensive water plan, meeting its 
goal of using no more freshwater in 
2060 than was used in 2010. 
I am proud to cosponsor this bill be-
cause it not only recognizes that urban 
and rural communities have different 
water infrastructure needs, but it also 
provides 
specific 
benefits 
to 
rural 
States like my State of Oklahoma. 
A month ago, the Water Quality Di-
vision director of the State of Okla-
homa Department of Environmental 
Quality, Shellie Chard, testified before 
the EPW Committee to highlight the 
challenges facing rural water systems 
and the innovation that they are using 
in rural States and communities to en-
sure 
safe 
and 
affordable 
drinking

water. She highlighted the need for as-
sistance to small, rural States in com-
plying with government regulations, 
and this bill does that by giving small 
and rural States access to Federal 
funding and assistance in complying 
with government regulations that are 
often 
more 
burdensome 
and 
over-
bearing for them. 
The bill also empowers rural commu-
nities to work with technical experts 
at nonprofit entities and State agen-
cies to implement best practices and 
more efficiently comply with the Fed-
eral regulations. When a small town 
like Meridian, OK, needs help address-
ing harmful contaminants in their 
water system, local rural water organi-
zations can provide consistent help and 
expertise, and they do. They are out 
there. They want to help. Dedicating 
resources to help our rural commu-
nities will ensure they spend more of 
their time and their money on commu-
nity projects, not navigating a bu-
reaucracy. 
More than just taking care of our 
water infrastructure today, this bill 
has an eye on the future by reauthor-
izing the Water Resources Research 
Act. The Water Resources Research 
Act supports cutting-edge water re-
search at universities across the coun-
try, including Oklahoma State Univer-
sity in Stillwater. OSU will receive re-
search funding over the next 4 years to 
study 
wastewater 
reuse, 
produced 
water from oil and gas operations, and 
more. 
The bill will also more than double 
the funding for the enhanced aquifer 
recharge research program. This pro-
gram does essential work to refill the 
groundwater aquifers, especially in 
areas with water shortages, to sustain 
a reliable municipal water supply. 
I thank my colleagues Senator CAR-
PER and Senator CAPITO for working to-
gether to move this bill through the 
normal committee process and bring it 
to the floor. This is what bipartisan-
ship means, and we do see this every 
day, in spite of what you might get 
from the media. I look forward to this 
bill being passed and enacted into law 
quickly. It is important that this not 
be the end of our bipartisan infrastruc-
ture work. 
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION PLAN 
Mr. President, we also need to reau-
thorize the new surface transportation 
plan before October 1. I know that it 
can be done because I did it twice with 
Senator Boxer. We did the MAP–21 pro-
gram; that was in 2012. We did the 
FAST Act in 2015. We were successful 
because we focused on actual infra-
structure—roads, 
highways, 
bridges, 
waterways, and the like. 
Senator CAPITO rolled out a meaning-
ful infrastructure package this last 
week. It is bold and focused on what 
our country actually needs. 
While President Biden and the Biden 
administration recognize the Repub-
lican plan as a starting point, sadly, 
Senate Democrats dismiss it outright, 
without even waiting to read it. And 
why? Because the extreme left wants 
to hijack the popularity of infrastruc-
ture to pass their Green New Deal 
agenda. 
You know, I had the honor of being 
with the President and the Vice Presi-
dent in the White House their first 
week in office. At that time, they were 
talking about the infrastructure pack-
age of the administration. I told the 
President at that time that one of the 
problems I have with what I feel is 
going to be in his infrastructure pack-
age is going to be using the popularity 
of infrastructure repair. That is pop-
ular. People want roads. They want 
highways. They want infrastructure. 
But they want to use that popularity 
to get their agenda passed. 
Now, in the infrastructure package 
that the President came out with, only 
about 7 percent of that actually ad-
dresses roads, highways, and bridges. 
So that is not what we want. We do 
have a bill coming out of the com-
mittee. 
The proof is in the numbers. The 
Biden plan would spend more on elec-
tric vehicle charging ports and sub-
sidies for electric cars than it does on 
roads, bridges, and airports combined. 
You know, I didn’t believe that when I 
first saw it. How can he come out with 
something that would actually spend 
more just on electrical vehicles than it 
does on roads, highways, and bridges? 
But that is exactly right because it 
would be $157 billion for roads, high-
ways, and bridges but $174 billion for 
electrical vehicle support. 
If this sounds familiar to you, that is 
because it is. Remember then-Presi-
dent Obama’s American ‘‘Recovery’’ 
Plan that was supposed to be a massive 
investment 
in 
infrastructure 
with 
‘‘shovel ready jobs’’? Well, less than 5 
percent of that bill went into infra-
structure. The rest of the $800 billion 
went to finance the Obama climate 
agenda. I guess history really does re-
peat itself because that same thing is 
happening today. Worse, it trades re-
sponsible pay-for methods with a tax- 
and-spend approach. 
A lot of people here may be too 
young to remember this, but I remem-
ber when the biggest problem we had in 
the highway trust fund was that we 
had too much money, that we had too 
much surplus. 
I ask the Presiding Officer, can you 
believe that, because you haven’t been 
here that long? But that actually was 
the problem. The highway trust fund 
was actually more than it needed to be. 
I can remember back during the Clin-
ton administration, I was pretty upset 
when he took several billion dollars 
out of that program. The surplus was 
there—I grant you that—but nonethe-
less we knew that leaner times were 
coming and that we would end up with 
a highway program that we would not 
be able to pay for out of the highway 
trust fund if we let people take money 
out of that trust fund. 
But, anyway, a lot of people here 
may be too young to remember that, 
but that actually did happen. 
One of the unique things about our 
highway system is the ‘‘user pays; user 
benefits’’ model. At a recent EPW hear-
ing that we had—that was just 2 weeks 
ago—every single witness was in agree-
ment that users who benefit should pay 
into the system. They all agreed that 
electric vehicles should be paying their 
fair share to maintain and improve our 
infrastructure. But, instead, the Biden 
plan takes the tax-and-spend approach, 
increasing the deficit and raising our 
corporate tax rate, undoing the his-
toric tax cuts that we achieved under 
the 
previous 
administration, 
the 
Trump administration. 
People hear that, and they don’t 
fully appreciate just what it means. 
They think that corporate tax rates 
won’t affect them. But the people hurt 
the most by the higher corporate tax 
rate tend to be in the most vulnerable 
categories. That is because higher 
taxes on job creators not only hurts 
American competitiveness around the 
world, but it means lower wages, lower 
GDP growth, and fewer jobs to go 
around. 
In fact, the nonpartisan CBO found 
that 70 percent of the savings busi-
nesses got when they lowered the cor-
porate tax rate in the Trump tax cuts 
went straight to worker wages, and the 
Biden plan would undo that very suc-
cessful program. A study done by Rice 
University found that raising the cor-
porate tax rate back to 28 percent, like 
the Biden plans do, will actually kill 1 
million jobs in just 2 years. 
Before the pandemic, the economy 
was growing fast, thanks in large part 
to the historic tax cuts and the regu-
latory reforms that drove the record 
job growth. 
In fact, we had the best economy in 
my lifetime, prior to the pandemic 
problem that came along. And now, 12 
months into the pandemic, as many 
States are just now allowing businesses 
to reopen, the administration is look-
ing to raise taxes on job creators who 
can get our economy back on track. 
The White House said it was serious 
about infrastructure investment, and I 
am committed to working with the 
President and my colleagues in the 
Senate to do this. It can be done this 
year, just as it has been many times in 
the past, but it needs to be real infra-
structure and not just a big-spending 
liberal climate bill. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to vote for 
this motion to proceed to the bipar-
tisan Drinking Water and Wastewater 
Infrastructure Act of 2021, otherwise 
known as DWWIA. 
As the ranking member of the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee, 
I have been working closely with 
Chairman 
CARPER
and 
Senators 
DUCKWORTH, 
LUMMIS, 
CARDIN, 
and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2216 
April 27, 2021 
drinking water and wastewater sys-
tems. Every city and town can tell you 
all about it. 
This bill authorizes more than $35 
billion for water resource development 
projects across the country, with a 
focus on upgrading aging infrastruc-
ture, addressing the emerging threats 
of extreme weather events, including 
those resulting from climate change, 
and cyber security vulnerabilities. This 
bill also includes measures to invest in 
innovative technologies, and it pro-
vides assistance to marginalized com-
munities. All of these things will help 
our communities keep their water safe 
and clean. 
Something I am particularly proud of 
is how this bill provides flexibility to 
both rural and urban areas and lets 
them decide how they can best address 
their needs. 
The most significant investments in 
this bill are in the drinking water and 
clean water State revolving funds. We 
know them as SRFs. The SRFs maxi-
mize authority for the States to deter-
mine how best to address drinking and 
wastewater challenges, utilizing a re-
volving loan fund to facilitate addi-
tional future investments. 
For rural States like West Virginia, 
we offer several solutions to unique 
water challenges. I will add here that 
we have a lot of great water in West 
Virginia. First, the bill invests $50 bil-
lion for those currently being served by 
intractable water systems. Those are 
the systems that service fewer than 
1,000 people and that have typically 
been abandoned by the operator. We 
have quite a few of those. Towns in the 
southern coalfields of West Virginia, 
like those in McDowell County, have 
historically struggled with this. 
Since many of these households can-
not connect to municipal water sys-
tems in an economic or technologically 
feasible way, the funding will go to a 
grant program to help them install en-
vironmentally 
sound, 
decentralized 
wastewater systems. This language is 
something that I worked on previously 
with my colleague from New Jersey 
CORY BOOKER when he was on the com-
mittee in the last Congress. 
The most pressing water issue, from 
a human health and environmental 
perspective in Appalachia, is undoubt-
edly straight piping. This practice is 
common in other exceptionally rural 
and remote areas around the country. 
So with new septic tanks installed, the 
grant program is working to improve 
quality of life and addresses public 
health and environmental concerns 
about straight piping waste into rivers 
and streams. 
Infrastructure resiliency and sustain-
ability is also a priority in this bill. In 
rural areas especially, some of the 
pipes are nearly 100 years old. I have 
actually heard about wooden pipes. 
Small towns often don’t have the reve-
nues to spend on expensive drinking 
water and wastewater infrastructure 
upgrades. That is why this legislation 
creates grants for small public water 
systems to replace components, to 
identify and prevent leaks, and to in-
stall meters. 
This is based off of language I intro-
duced last Congress in the Assuring 
Quality Water Infrastructure Act. I 
was joined there by my colleague BEN 
CARDIN
of Maryland to address the 
needs of small water systems that are 
facing operational challenges in main-
taining drinking water services. Every 
State has them. 
In West Virginia, that is often the re-
sult of old infrastructure or the lack of 
adequate mapping of where these as-
sets actually exist. It is hard to fix 
leaks when you can’t find them. 
Reports have shown—this stunned me 
when I saw this—that only one-quarter 
of the water that West Virginia water 
systems pay to have treated and 
pumped even reaches a faucet—one 
quarter. That is how much water leaks 
out. I think about other States that 
have water shortages, and here we are 
wasting so much water in a State like 
ours, which has an abundance of water. 
Water is a precious resource, and 
wasting that much of it because of 
leaky pipes and faulty infrastructure is 
absolutely unacceptable. The $250 mil-
lion grant program will help provide 
the technical assistance and infrastruc-
ture investments that these small sys-
tems, serving 10,000 people or fewer, 
need to address to get those challenges 
off their backs and to get on sure fiscal 
footing as they better serve their cus-
tomers. 
Of course, we don’t want to forget 
about our midsize and large drinking 
water systems. Another program that I 
worked on last Congress, again, with 
Senator CARDIN, addresses the resil-
iency of drinking water and waste-
water systems. 
Adapted from the Clean Water Infra-
structure Resilience and Sustainability 
Act, these programs, totaling $370 mil-
lion over 5 years, will help to protect 
public water systems from a host of 
threats, both natural and manmade. 
In West Virginia and in many other 
parts of the country, the greatest 
threats to drinking and wastewater in-
frastructure come from flooding. These 
investments will harden infrastructure 
against these threats and protect tax-
payers from paying for the same infra-
structure again and again. 
I just discussed physical resilience, 
but we must also ensure the resilience 
of our water utility workforce, those 
workers who ensure the continued op-
eration and maintenance of drinking 
water and wastewater systems every 
day. 
Section 211 of DWWIA focuses on the 
resilience of America’s water utility 
workforce by addressing recruitment, 
training, 
and 
retention 
challenges. 
This is a topic very important to me, 
and I worked, again, with my colleague 
from New Jersey Senator BOOKER, on 
this issue. 
I cannot help but think that we regu-
larly take for granted the public health 
services provided by this Nation’s 
water utility workforce. We just don’t 
really think about who is actually 
working there and providing the serv-
ice that we sometimes take for grant-
ed. 
Unfortunately, a large portion of the 
men and women who are in our water 
treatment facilities are getting older 
and they are retiring, and that is why 
we need to make sure that we have the 
next 
generation 
of 
water 
workers 
ready. 
This bill increases funding authorized 
to $25 million over 5 years for the pro-
gram that helps water systems grow 
their workforce through apprentice-
ships, through training programs, and 
it also helps with their retention ef-
forts. This program has been extremely 
popular with water systems around the 
country, and Congress has recognized 
this by funding it beyond the author-
ization level. 
It is critical that we provide the 
tools and investments necessary to 
help our drinking water and waste-
water systems face these challenges 
head-on. After all, this is the workforce 
that will ensure the operation and 
maintenance of all the other infra-
structure investments this package 
creates. 
Additional technical assistance can 
also help systems with operations—it 
is much more complicated than what it 
used to be—and prevent outages and 
costly compliance issues. Section 206 
establishes and authorizes a circuit 
rider program designed to help owners 
and operators of small- and medium- 
sized publicly owned treatment works. 
We have heard from the water com-
munity that other circuit rider pro-
grams have been a tremendous asset in 
providing technical assistance. It only 
makes sense for the EPA to similarly 
provide technical assistance since they 
implement the relevant regulations. 
This 
can 
be 
tremendously 
helpful 
where a system may be struggling with 
an insufficient workforce and also 
must be a part of the resilience discus-
sion. 
Another concern for us was the 
alarming 
trend 
in 
cyber 
security 
threats in water systems. In February, 
you 
all 
might 
remember, 
hackers 
accessed a Florida water treatment fa-
cility computer system and were able 
to remotely raise the level of sodium 
hydroxide in the water. That is not just 
scary; it is alarming. 
This has huge national security im-
plications on top of the obvious public 
health concerns. Thankfully, that hack 
was detected and the system was re-
turned to normal before the public was 
ever at risk. But in this day and age, 
water infrastructure resiliency also has 
to include addressing these cyber secu-
rity issues. So we made sure that these 
vulnerabilities 
could 
be 
addressed 
under resiliency grants. 
While water infrastructure invest-
ments are critical to ensuring we are 
not wasting water and our water is 
clean, it is also critical from an eco-
nomic development perspective. Berke-

April 27, 2021 
DC—in West Virginia made huge in-
vestments into their water infrastruc-
ture system to ensure the system could 
handle the volume of water that the 
brand-new Procter & Gamble plant 
needed. And it is massive amounts of 
water, and it is a massive plant. We are 
very happy that they are there employ-
ing over 1,000 West Virginians. 
So with that upgraded water system, 
P&G was able to operate more effi-
ciently and even to expand—and they 
are still expanding—and that meant 
more jobs. That kind of opportunity 
needs to be available everywhere, not 
just in my home State but in Con-
necticut and in other places around the 
country. 
These are just a few of the provisions 
that address and are informed by the 
particular challenges that face my 
State. But based on the feedback of my 
colleagues in both parties and the 
groundswell of support from various 
water advocacy groups, it is clear these 
provisions have broad applicability to 
help communities all across this beau-
tiful country. 
It is why we have such a diverse and 
growing coalition of more than 70 sup-
porters—from water systems to local 
governments, to industry, to labor, to 
environmental organizations—who are 
supporting this legislation, not to men-
tion that we had a unanimous vote out 
of committee. 
These organizations recognize the 
value of this legislation and its com-
monsense and responsible approach to 
addressing our water infrastructure 
issues. We will be discussing more of 
the valuable provisions of this bill on 
the Senate floor this week, and I look 
forward to that debate. 
In closing, I just want to urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of advanc-
ing this bill and, later, for final pas-
sage. I mentioned it passed unani-
mously out of committee. There is a 
big debate in the broader sense: Can 
Congress get together on infrastruc-
ture? This is what I would define as 
basic, 
core 
infrastructure. 
This, 
I 
think, is a good test case for us, and 
this, I think, is one in which we all 
have a great interest. Conservatives, 
moderates, and liberals all came to-
gether on this. 
I would like to thank my counterpart 
and my chairman, Senator CARPER, and 
his staff for their work, as well as our 
Water 
Subcommittee 
counterpart 
chairman, Senator DUCKWORTH, and 
Ranking Member LUMMIS. 
This bill is proof that we can work 
together on infrastructure. This is a bi-
partisan, responsible, meaningful in-
vestment. We are taking care of pipes, 
we are looking out for our environ-
ment, and we are putting special em-
phasis on helping rural and disadvan-
taged communities. At the end of the 
day, this bill is really about helping 
people. This is a bipartisan bill that we 
can all be proud of. 
Again, I ask my colleagues to vote 
yes on the motion to proceed and again 
on the underlying bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to com-
plete my remarks, given the time con-
straints. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF COLIN HACKETT KAHL 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise in opposition to the nomination 
of Colin Kahl to serve as Undersecre-
tary of Defense for Policy. 
Our Nation needs leaders at the De-
partment of Defense who are not driven 
by a partisan agenda and are com-
mitted to making sure our troops have 
all the resources and support they need 
to succeed. We need leaders who under-
stand that our adversaries are regimes 
like those in Communist China and 
Iran and that our friends are countries 
like Israel and its partners in the Mid-
dle East. That is not Dr. Kahl. I have 
grave concerns about Dr. Kahl’s lack of 
support for one of our great allies, 
Israel, weakness toward Communist 
China and desire to rejoin the disas-
trous Iran Deal. 
The Undersecretary of Defense for 
Policy serves as the Defense Sec-
retary’s top national security adviser, 
a position that requires sound judge-
ment and an even temperament. Dr. 
Kahl’s history of partisan rhetoric 
makes him unfit for this position. 
For all these reasons, I oppose Mr. 
Kahl’s nomination and urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to oppose Colin Kahl’s nomina-
tion for Under Secretary of Defense for 
Policy, and I advise my colleagues to 
do the same, as we are getting ready to 
take a vote on this very important po-
sition in the Pentagon. That, to me, is 
one of the most important positions we 
have at the Department of Defense. 
While I have many policy disagree-
ments with Dr. Kahl, which I have dis-
cussed at length with him, I want to 
say I have a long history of working 
across the aisle, with Democrats and 
Republicans, on defense issues, even 
with those with whom I don’t agree on 
their policies. As a matter of fact, the 
Presiding Officer and I have a very 
strong working relationship, and we 
don’t agree on a lot of issues, particu-
larly on issues of the military. 
I serve on the Armed Services Com-
mittee, and I take these matters very 
seriously. They are some of the main 
reasons I ran for the U.S. Senate 61⁄2 
years ago. I focus a lot on military per-
sonnel, uniform and civilian, whom we 
put in the Pentagon and who have this 
enormous responsibility to oversee the 
Department of Defense. 
Whether they are Assistant Secre-
taries, Under Secretaries, admirals, or 
generals, I try to understand where 
they are coming from, and I have a 
record of strongly supporting almost 
all of them, whether they have been in 
the Obama administration, the Trump 
administration, or even are in the 
Biden administration. For example, I 
not only supported the Secretary of 
Defense, Lloyd Austin, knowing that I 
wasn’t going to agree with him on ev-
erything, but I actually introduced him 
at his confirmation hearing because I 
served with him in the military, and I 
know he is a man of honor and char-
acter. I strongly supported the Deputy 
Secretary of Defense, Kath Hicks, 
given her background and knowledge. 
Yet some nominees I have not and I 
will not support, particularly in this 
area that is so important to our Na-
tion’s defense. I will object to these 
people because, like Dr. Kahl, I don’t 
believe he has the temperament or 
judgment to do the job. 
Like I said, I have looked at and fo-
cused on dozens and dozens of members 
with regard to their temperament and 
judgment who need Senate confirma-
tion to the Department of Defense. The 
vast, vast majority, Democrat or Re-
publican, I have supported but not this 
one. And this is a really important po-
sition. The Under Secretary of Defense 
for Policy is essentially the No. 3 posi-
tion in the Pentagon. 
As I mentioned, it is my view and, I 
believe, the view of most of my col-
leagues, at least on this side of the 
aisle, that Dr. Kahl does not have the 
temperament or judgment. In fact, I 
believe that he has the potential to be 
a liability to our national security and 
our defense and not to be viewed favor-
ably by the men and women he is sup-
posed to lead. 
Let me talk about temperament and 
give a little bit of background. 
Not even a year ago, a number of 
Senate 
Democrats, 
my 
colleagues, 
wrote of the official who was nomi-
nated by the Trump administration for 
this same position, the Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Policy, BG An-
thony Tata. The letter that was signed 
by a number of my Senate Democratic 
colleagues, many of whom are on the 
Committee on Armed Services, focused 
on that nominee’s record of ‘‘offensive 
and inflammatory comments which 
would disqualify you from serving in 
your current position and the position 
for which you have been nominated.’’ 
That is one of the quotes. Remember, 
this was for the same position but with 
the Trump administration. 
This letter also read that he had 
made inflammatory remarks regarding 
the President—that would be President 
Obama—and inflammatory remarks re-
garding rhetoric for Members of Con-
gress as well. Again, that was last year. 
This is the standard that was being 
used. 
This letter goes on to read: 
Your multiple past statements cannot be 
dismissed as simple aberration. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD this 
letter dated July 24, 2020. 
There being no objection, the material was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD as fol-
lows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2218 
April 27, 2021 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, July 24, 2020. 
Brigadier General (ret.) ANTHONY J. TATA, 
Senior Advisor, U.S. Department of Defense, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR BRIGADIER GENERAL TATA: We write 
to urge that you withdraw your nomination 
to be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy 
at the Department of Defense (the Depart-
ment) and resign your current position as a 
senior advisor. Your record of offensive and 
inflammatory comments disqualifies you 
from serving in your current position and 
the position for which you have been nomi-
nated. 
If confirmed by the Senate to be Under 
Secretary of Defense for Policy, you would 
become ‘‘the principal official reporting to 
the Secretary of Defense who is responsible 
for policy development and planning [. . .], 
lead[ing] the formulation and coordination 
of national security and defense policy with 
the 
Department 
of 
Defense 
[. . .], 
integrat[ing] policies and plans to achieve 
desired objectives [. . . and] build[ing] part-
nerships and defense cooperation with U.S. 
friends and allies. In other words, you would 
have significant, wide-ranging influence on 
the policies and activities of the Pentagon 
and defense relationships with our most crit-
ical allies and partners. 
Anyone nominated to be a high-ranking 
Pentagon official must be qualified and also 
a person of high character whose record is 
consistent with the values of our country 
and those of the U.S. military. Nominees 
should see the value diversity, inclusion, and 
unity bring to our institutions. Unfortu-
nately, your history of public remarks does 
not meet this standard. In 2018, you said that 
Islam is the ‘‘most oppressive violent reli-
gion I know of,’’ and that the 2015 agreement 
to block Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weap-
on alone is more than enough evidence of 
[former President Barack Obama’s] drive to 
subvert U.S. national interests to Islam and 
a globalist agenda. You called President 
Obama a ‘‘terrorist leader’’ and alleged that 
the former president ‘‘made no secret of his 
belief that a weaker America made for a 
stronger 
world. 
Moreover, 
you 
falsely 
claimed that President Obama ‘‘is a Mus-
lim—repeating a claim used by then-presi-
dential candidate Donald Trump and others 
who attempt to incite anti-Muslim prejudice 
and otherize Islam by suggesting it is an in-
ferior religion and synonymous with ter-
rorism. You also said in a now-deleted tweet 
on July 2, 2018, ‘‘Never a doubt. Among doz-
ens of clues, Obama supported Russian med-
dling in 2016 election & influenced Israeli 
elections to try to oust Netanyahu & help 
Hamas & Muslim brotherhood U.S. really did 
have Manchurian Candidate in White House. 
Unfortunately, 
your 
inflammatory 
re-
marks did not stop there. You reserved fur-
ther dishonorable and disqualifying rhetoric 
for members of Congress as well. For exam-
ple, you claimed that Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
and Congresswoman Maxine Waters ‘‘have 
always been the same violent extremist’’ and 
referred to Congresswoman Waters in par-
ticular as a ‘‘vicious race baiting racist.’’ 
Only after your nomination became public 
and reports exposed your repugnant state-
ments, many of which you deleted, you 
walked them back in a recent letter to the 
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman 
and Ranking Member. In that letter, you re-
portedly refer to your offensive tweets as an 
‘‘aberration in a four-decade thread of faith-
ful public service. Furthermore, you noted 
that 
despite 
your 
‘‘strong 
record 
of 
inclusivity and bipartisanship in my com-
mentary,’’ you ‘‘did misspeak in 2018 on 
Twitter in hyperbolic conversations’’ and 
that ‘‘[t]here is no excuse for those com-
ments, for which I take complete responsi-
bility and also fully retract and denounce.’’ 
Your letter to committee leadership ap-
pears to be a conveniently timed retraction 
by someone who has suddenly realized his 
nomination is in jeopardy. But your multiple 
past statements cannot be dismissed simply 
as an aberration. No one with a record of re-
peated, repugnant statements like yours 
should be nominated to serve in a senior po-
sition of public trust at the Pentagon. Your 
views are wholly incompatible with the U.S. 
military’s values. 
Thank you for your attention to this mat-
ter. We call on you to withdraw your nomi-
nation. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. You have almost the 
identical situation here. What hap-
pened with General Tata is that his 
nomination, for a lot of these reasons, 
was withdrawn by the Trump adminis-
tration. Yet now you have the same, 
almost identical issues with this nomi-
nee, and when I showed this letter to 
my Democratic colleagues, they were 
like, ‘‘Oh, no. That’s OK.’’ It is not OK. 
It is not OK. 
So let’s talk about temperament and 
tweets with Dr. Kahl. 
Really, the issue here is, is he more 
of a political hack who is tweeting all 
of the time—he tweets quite a lot—or 
is he somebody with the temperament 
of a partisan internet troll, or is he a 
measured 
national 
security 
profes-
sional who can lead the Pentagon in 
the No. 3 position? Unfortunately, I 
think it is the former issue, not the 
latter. He has a long history of tweets. 
Just like the issues that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
objected to last year for this same posi-
tion with the Trump administration’s 
nominee, who was withdrawn for these 
reasons, here is just a small example of 
Dr. Kahl’s tweets. These are the same 
issues that my colleagues were con-
cerned about. There have been a lot of 
attacks on Members of Congress. OK. 
That is fine. We are in the public 
arena. 
Here is what he wrote: 
The GOP used to pride itself as the party 
that put values front and center in U.S. for-
eign policy. Now they are the party of ethnic 
cleansing. 
OK. I don’t think we are the party of 
ethnic cleansing. That is pretty strong 
stuff. 
He tweeted more: 
Let’s not mince words. The Trump admin-
istration kidnapped children. The Repub-
lican Party, in terms of national security, 
are now part of a ‘‘death cult.’’ 
He retweeted the now discredited 
Lincoln Project attacks. I know a lot 
about them. It spent a lot of money in 
my race. It is a very discredited group 
of people, by the way. Very disturbed 
are some of their leaders at the Lincoln 
Project. 
He calls and tweets that the Presi-
dent of the United States, the Com-
mander in Chief, is a moron, is repug-
nant, is a coward. He went on to call 
my colleagues in the Senate many ad-
ditional things that I won’t repeat 
here. He did this a lot. 
No matter what your views are of my 
colleagues or of the former President, 
words matter, and attacks matter. If 
you can’t refrain from making them, 
maybe you don’t belong in the No. 3 po-
sition in the Pentagon. That was the 
conclusion that pretty much everybody 
made last year, so why should it be dif-
ferent with this candidate? It shouldn’t 
be different. 
Don’t get me wrong. It is a free coun-
try. You are allowed to tweet and criti-
cize the Commander in Chief and Mem-
bers of Congress all the time. That is 
fine. That is what America is. That is 
what democracy is. But that doesn’t 
mean you get a free pass to be the No. 
3 guy at the U.S. Department of De-
fense, which is what he wants. 
So that is temperament, and I don’t 
think it is a good temperament with 
which to lead the Pentagon at all. 
Let’s talk about judgment, especially 
policy judgment. The questions of tem-
perament are often closely aligned 
with but they are not the same as judg-
ment, particularly as it relates to poli-
cies. Judgment is being able to assess a 
situation, use history as a guide, and 
take appropriate action. 
I think this nominee lacks judgment, 
which is something that was shown 
when 
he 
was 
then-Vice 
President 
Biden’s National Security Advisor. Let 
me provide a few examples. 
First, as many know, he was a 
staunch advocate for the Iran nuclear 
deal and, I believe, an advocate on 
being soft on Iran. 
By the way, it is not always said in 
public, but a bipartisan majority of 
U.S. Senators and a bipartisan major-
ity of Members of the House all op-
posed the Iran deal, but in my view, ap-
peasing the world’s largest state spon-
sor of terrorism, these terrorists—lead-
ers with the blood of thousands of 
American troops on their hands—is not 
smart policy judgment. 
Dr. Kahl doesn’t seem to know when 
we can press the Iranians, and this is a 
really big issue. Every time someone 
tried to press them—draw a redline, 
take aggressive action—he criticized 
it. 
Dr. Kahl, in 2015, argued for sanctions 
relief on Iran, claiming that the vast 
majority of the relief would go to but-
ter, not guns. Well, we know how that 
turned out. That money went to arm-
ing terrorists and the continuation of 
Iran’s proxies around the Middle East 
and around the world who were com-
mitting terrorism. 
Dr. Kahl said that pulling out of the 
Iran nuclear deal was ‘‘a dangerous de-
lusion.’’ 
He said: The ‘‘hawks in Congress’’— 
and I think he meant that as an insult. 
By the way, I view that not as an in-
sult, particularly after the Obama- 
Biden 
administration 
cut 
defense 
spending by 25 percent and drastically 
reduced readiness—who are supporting 
pulling out of the Iran deal ‘‘won’t be 
satisfied until they get the war they 
have pushed for decades.’’ Really? I 
didn’t want war with Iran. Those who 
opposed the JCPOA—again, a bipar-
tisan majority of the U.S. Senators— 
didn’t want a war with Iran. We just 
thought the JCPOA was misguided.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2219 
April 27, 2021 
After the U.S. strike that killed Ira-
nian 
terror 
commando 
Qasem 
Soleimani, Kahl tweeted the following: 
Trump has started a war with Iran and 
Iraq. 
Really? I think what the President 
and our fine military did when they 
killed General Soleimani was reestab-
lish deterrence, which we had lost in 
the Middle East when this terrorist 
killed thousands and wounded thou-
sands of U.S. service men and women 
and never had to pay consequences. We 
reestablished a redline and said: If you 
kill Americans, you are going to pay. 
Guess what. That war never hap-
pened, although Kahl predicted it. 
Even Iran’s Foreign Minister, Mo-
hammad Zarif, acknowledged in these 
tapes that we have been talking about 
here on the Senate floor that the kill-
ing of Soleimani ‘‘was when the United 
States delivered a major blow to Iran 
more damaging than if it had wiped out 
an entire city in an attack.’’ That was 
from the Foreign Minister of Iran’s 
knowing that what we did was very sig-
nificant. 
Dr. Kahl, if you look at his tweets, 
wouldn’t have done that because he 
thought it would have ‘‘brought the 
war that the hawks want.’’ We didn’t 
want a war, and we didn’t get a war. 
Just like John Kerry, who is now 
being accused of leaking secrets that 
Israel had—one of our most important 
allies—to Iran, the world’s largest 
state sponsor of terrorism, I believe he 
is soft on Iran. 
We are going to get to the bottom of 
the Kerry issue, by the way. It is al-
leged what he did, but if he did it, if he 
sold out Israel for Iran, he needs to re-
sign and be fired. We are going to get 
to the bottom of that. 
Let me mention one other issue. It is 
a sensitive one—I admit it—but I think 
it is also an important one with Dr. 
Kahl. 
At his confirmation hearing, he said 
that one of his priorities was to ‘‘stamp 
out ‘systemic racism’ within the ranks 
of the military.’’ 
Now, look, I care about this issue, 
and every organization has bad people 
in it. I spoke on the Senate floor last 
year about some of these issues. I put 
forward legislation last year in the 
NDAA that looks at why we aren’t hav-
ing promotions of African Americans 
at higher ranks and at the highest 
ranks of the military. This is an issue 
I care about, but when he said this in 
his 
confirmation 
hearing—systemic 
racism within the ranks—I was very 
curious. Has he served in the ranks, 
maybe? No, he hasn’t. I have for 26 
years—still serving. Where did he get 
the information? That is a broad state-
ment to make about our troops whom 
you want to lead. 
During the hearing, Dr. Kahl admit-
ted he had ‘‘no credible evidence to 
back up that kind of statement.’’ Well, 
that is a real lack of judgment. 
You are besmirching a bunch—a big 
portion of the force, with no credible 
data to back it up, and you want to be 
the No. 3 leader in the Pentagon? 
This is judgment, and this is one of 
the many reasons I am going to vote 
against him, and I hope that my col-
leagues do. 
Let me end with one final thing. Dr. 
Kahl made a statement in his con-
firmation hearing about the require-
ments of the job: 
The position of undersecretary of defense 
for policy, while it’s a political appointment, 
is not a political job. It’s a policy job, one 
that requires [whoever is in the position] to 
be nonpartisan. 
Well, given his judgment, given his 
temperament, I don’t believe Dr. Kahl 
has lived up to his own assessment of 
what is required to serve in the Penta-
gon’s third most important defense 
role. I don’t believe he has the quali-
fications for this position. There are 
plenty of good policy experts—Demo-
crats, I am sure, who do—and I would 
encourage 
my 
colleagues 
to 
vote 
against this nomination for these rea-
sons. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent to speak for up to 7 min-
utes prior to the vote on the Kahl nom-
ination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to speak about Colin Kahl, the Presi-
dent’s nominee to be Under Secretary 
of Defense for Policy. 
The most basic responsibility of our 
government and our military is to pro-
tect the national security of the Amer-
ican people, which requires helping our 
allies and constraining our enemies. 
The Pentagon’s policy chief is respon-
sible for those evaluations. 
Unfortunately, I have come to be-
lieve that Colin Kahl’s judgment is ir-
reparably marred by obsessive animos-
ity toward Israel. I can think of no 
other way to explain his years of con-
sistently wrong views regarding the 
Middle East—and not just wrong but 
impulsive and reckless. 
He has repeatedly spilled out his con-
spiracy theories and attacks on Twit-
ter and other public venues. He views 
the world through a cracked lens. 
And I challenge my Democratic col-
leagues to explain one simple thing: 
What other explanation, other than an-
imosity to the world’s only Jewish 
state, could possibly account for all of 
these staggeringly wrong judgments? 
I would like to begin with a topic the 
Senate has been united on: our opposi-
tion to anti-Semitism and to anti-Se-
mitic conspiracy theories. 
In 2019, this body came together 
unanimously to pass a resolution that I 
authored, along with Democratic Sen-
ator TIM KAINE, condemning anti-Sem-
itism as a unique form of bigotry that 
distorts people’s judgments. 
Recently, a top adviser to the Aya-
tollah Khomeini acknowledged what 
the world long knew—that in 2018, in 
an operation right out of a Hollywood 
action movie, Israel seized Iran’s na-
tional nuclear archive. The archive 
proved that Iran had been keeping nu-
clear weapons blueprints and materials 
on the shelf. The nuclear deal, of which 
Kahl was a principle architect, had 
been flawed from the start. 
Kahl responded to the news of the 
raid by suggesting on Twitter the ar-
chive was fabricated by Israel, with the 
aim of dragging American boys and 
girls into another Middle East war. 
This was a pernicious, anti-Sematic 
conspiracy theory, a blood libel, not 
just pernicious but wrong. 
That was not the only time Kahl lev-
eled 
troubling 
conspiracy 
theories 
about Israel and Iran. He suggested on 
Twitter that Trump’s policies regard-
ing the Iran deal and Jerusalem were 
linked to donations from Jewish bil-
lionaire Sheldon Adelson. This is not 
the judgment of anyone who should be 
anywhere near power or policy. 
Another decision the Trump adminis-
tration made was to move our Embassy 
in Israel to Jerusalem. There was an 
active debate within the Trump admin-
istration. I leaned in vigorously with 
the President, and the President agreed 
with the view I articulated; that we 
should say to our friends and our en-
emies that we stand unshakably with 
the nation of Israel. 
Kahl spent years fighting against 
that move, fighting against moving our 
Embassy. According to reports from 
2012, Kahl was personally responsible 
for trying to remove language from the 
Democratic Party platform embracing 
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
This is a long-abiding passion of his. 
And when President Trump recog-
nized Jerusalem, Kahl predicted it 
would isolate the United States and 
Israel and even potentially trigger a 
third intifada. He was wrong. 
Just like he was wrong about sup-
porting Israel, he was wrong about op-
posing Iran. In 2017, Congress passed 
legislation mandating that the Presi-
dent declare Iran’s IRGC a terrorist or-
ganization. Kahl said we were playing 
‘‘politics’’ so that we could show we 
were tough on Iran, and again he pre-
dicted disaster. Again, he was wrong. 
Kahl has even attacked Democrats 
on this issue. For instance, he has re-
peatedly attacked Chairman MENENDEZ 
for trying to ‘‘kill’’ and use ‘‘poison 
pills’’ to block appeasement of the Ira-
nian regime. 
Turning 
to 
current 
topics, 
the 
Obama-Biden team shamefully, repeat-
edly, recklessly used leaks to leak se-
crets about Israeli operations against 
Iranian terrorists and forces. 
Now there are new reports on a taped 
phone call that then-Secretary of State 
Kerry may have leaked Israeli attacks 
to Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif, with 
whom he is personally close. If verified, 
these reports would mean he mali-
ciously endangered not just Israeli na-
tional security but American lives. If 
these reports are true, John Kerry 
should resign, and if he doesn’t resign, 
President Biden should fire him. 
Colin Kahl was prominent in shaping 
Obama-Biden policies on Israel and

Iran, and he has been credibly accused 
of weaponizing and leaking classified 
information. 
I recently joined 17 other Senators in 
a letter to FBI Director Wray, request-
ing that the FBI immediately inves-
tigate whether he did so. But we are 
not going to have the answer before we 
vote today, and I don’t see how he can 
be principally advanced without it. 
On issues of foreign policy, this body 
is often united when standing up 
against our enemies and standing for 
our friends. This nominee, I believe, is 
the most virulently anti-Israel nomi-
nee who would serve in the entire 
Biden administration. 
Many of our friends on the Demo-
cratic aisle like to say they support 
the nation of Israel. Well, this is a 
chance to demonstrate you mean it be-
cause you cannot vote to confirm a 
rabid, anti-Israel, conspiracy theory- 
tweeting radical to the No. 3 position 
in the Department of Defense and then 
claim you are a reliable friend of 
Israel. 
Colin 
Kahl’s 
record 
is 
extreme, 
fringe, and radical. He has a lifelong 
obsession with and antipathy to the 
State of Israel, and he has dem-
onstrated a willingness to endanger 
Israeli lives and American lives to ad-
vance that hostility. 
I urge our colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to oppose this nomination. 
I yield the floor.

COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I rise today to discuss the COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act. I was a cosponsor of 
this bill, which was introduced by Sen-
ator HIRONO and passed the Senate on 
April 22, 2021, by a vote of 94 to 1. I was 
in Minnesota to attend the memorial 
service for Daunte Wright when the bill 
came up for a vote, but I would have 
voted in favor of the bill had I been 
present. 
I have been alarmed by the sharp in-
crease in hate crimes against members 
of the Asian-American Pacific Islander, 
AAPI, community during the pan-
demic. According to Stop AAPI Hate, 
there have been approximately 3,800 in-
cidents of anti-Asian bias across the 
country in the last year, and that num-
ber only includes what has been re-
ported. As we saw with the recent mass 
shooting in Georgia, in which six of the 
eight victims were women of Asian de-
scent, these crimes are horrifying and 
heartbreaking. 
I have also talked to constituents in 
my State who have experienced verbal 
attacks, physical abuse, and threats to 
their businesses simply because they 
are members of the AAPI community. 
What they have endured is not right. 
These are hate crimes, and it is time 
for us to stand together, to denounce 
hate, and take action. 
When I first arrived at the Senate, I 
worked hard to pass the Matthew 
Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate 
Crimes Prevention Act. As a pros-
ecutor, I was at the White House when 
President Bill Clinton introduced the 
bill, and 9 years later, I got to cast one 
of the deciding votes to make the bill a 
reality. Since then I have worked with 
Senator MURKOWSKI to introduce the 
bipartisan Justice for Victims of Hate 
Crimes Act, which will help to ensure 
that Federal prosecutors can effec-
tively enforce the Federal hate crimes 
law. After places of worship were tar-
gets of violence in my State, I joined 
my colleagues in cosponsoring legisla-
tion to strengthen protections for reli-
gious institutions that was signed into 
law in September 2018. 
The COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act will 
ensure that the Department of Justice 
invests the resources needed to fully 
investigate 
pandemic-related 
hate 
crimes against Asian Americans and 
will support local law enforcement to 
report and respond to hate crimes. 
While there is more we must do to root 
out hate and bias in our country, this 
bill is an important step forward, and I 
am grateful to Senator HIRONO for her 
work in leading this legislation.

Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise 
today to recognize the distinguished 
career and retirement of Lori Housman 
after 20 years of service at the Congres-
sional Budget Office. Throughout her 
time at CBO, Lori has been a corner-
stone of the Medicare unit. Her exper-
tise in Medicare’s payment policy for 
physicians, as well as her patience and 
good humor, has been essential to the 
Congress as it has developed legislation 
in this complicated area. 
During her time in public service, 
Lori has worked on legislation that 
dramatically changed how Medicare 
operates, including the Affordable Care 
Act and the Medicare Access and CHIP 
Reauthorization Act of 2015, commonly 
referred to as MACRA. Lori’s tireless 
dedication to providing the Congress 
with objective analysis embodies the 
best of CBO’s commitment to serving 
both sides of the aisle with expertise, 
professionalism, and fairness. Her ex-
emplary work in analyzing legislation 
is matched by her warmth toward and 
genuine interest in others, earning her 
the admiration of congressional staff. 
Her efforts over the years have surely 
helped to make the Medicare Program 
better for tens of millions of Ameri-
cans. 
To her colleagues, Lori is a constant 
source of knowledge, support, and 
kindness. She has trained many groups 
of 
CBO 
analysts 
and 
managers 
throughout her tenure, teaching them 
to think critically about how legisla-
tion can be translated into analytical 
models and how to explain how legisla-
tion can be clarified to better reflect 
the intent of the Congress. In addition 
to her contributions to CBO’s analyt-
ical work, her colleagues at CBO con-
gressional staff are grateful for her pa-
tience and generous spirit, especially 
in extraordinary circumstances. 
As chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, I, along with Ranking Member 
CRAPO, thank Lori for her service, and 
we wish her a relaxing, well-deserved 
retirement with her husband Van on 
their boat, Pigs Flew.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
CENTENNIAL OF CONNECTICUT 
LIONS CLUBS 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, today I rise to recognize Lions 
Clubs International as it celebrates 100 
years of outstanding service in Con-
necticut. 
In the winter of 1921, Lions Clubs 
International, now the world’s largest 
service organization, dispatched an or-
ganizer to Connecticut to form the 
first Lions Club in New England, the 
Bridgeport Host Lions Club. Through-
out their century of service, these vol-
unteers have worked diligently to help 
set up a fresh-air camp for Bridgeport’s 
youth, create a vision clinic at Bridge-
port Hospital, purchase x-ray devices 
at St. Vincent’s Medical Center, pro-
vide dental services for the indigent at 
Park City Hospital, and a litany of 
other community projects. Lions Clubs 
in New Haven, Greater Hartford, New 
Britain, New London, Greenwich, Wa-
terbury, Meriden, Torrington, and Bris-
tol would soon follow. Today, approxi-
mately 160 clubs with over 4,600 Lions 
are serving their communities, many 
collaborating with local governments 
to act as dependable volunteer arms. 
In 1925, a future Connecticut resi-
dent, Helen Keller, would have a pro-
found impact on the mission and very 
future of Lions Clubs International 
with her simple plea: ‘‘Will you not 
help me hasten the day when there 
shall be no preventable blindness; no 
little deaf, blind child untaught; no 
blind man or woman unaided? I appeal 
to you Lions, you who have your sight, 
your hearing, you who are strong and 
brave and kind. Will you not constitute 
yourselves Knights of the Blind in this 
crusade 
against 
darkness?’’ 
Con-
necticut Lions not only embraced her 
message, but also did much more, do-
nating monies and time to support 
their communities locally and glob-
ally. Lions Clubs across the State have 
sponsored parades, festivals, and school 
projects, as well as raised funds for 
building equipment to improve the 
quality of life for children, the dis-
abled, 
seniors, 
and 
veterans. 
Con-
necticut Lions have taken families in 
need shopping to make their holidays 
brighter. In support of the health and 
well-being of their communities, Lions 
Clubs have donated ambulances, school 
buses and other vehicles, and vital

equipment to our local emergency re-
sponse teams, senior centers, and so-
cial services agencies. 
Perhaps the most critical area of 
focus for Lions Clubs has been in vision 
care. In their ‘‘crusade against dark-
ness,’’ Lions Clubs have raised enor-
mous sums for research into blindness 
and eye disease. The Connecticut Lions 
Eye Research Foundation was char-
tered in 1956, establishing an eye re-
search clinic under the auspices of Yale 
University, and later helped establish a 
second research facility with the Uni-
versity of Connecticut. Thanks to the 
work at these clinics, thousands of 
children and adults have benefitted 
from quality care and research. 
Connecticut Lions have also estab-
lished three District Lions Low Vision 
Centers to improve the quality of life 
and independence of those suffering 
from low vision. I have personally vis-
ited one of these centers and listened 
to healthcare providers and patients 
discuss how important and valuable 
these centers are. 
For those still struggling with hear-
ing and vision issues, the Connecticut 
Lions have supported the Connecticut 
Radio Information System with dona-
tions, volunteer readers, and other as-
sistance. Guide and service dogs have 
been sponsored by Connecticut Lions, 
helping to restore the independence of 
the blind and visually impaired in their 
communities. 
Connecticut Lions have also been 
deeply involved in providing relief from 
disaster and tragedy. In the early 
stages of the COVID–19 pandemic, Con-
necticut Lions secured sizeable grants 
from Lions Clubs International Foun-
dation to purchase and distribute criti-
cally needed equipment for our first re-
sponders and healthcare workers. When 
Hurricane Sandy devastated much of 
the State’s shoreline, our Lions Clubs 
provided meals for first responders and 
volunteers who worked tirelessly to 
rescue people and restore services fol-
lowing the storm. Immediately fol-
lowing the Sandy Hook tragedy in De-
cember 2012, the Newtown Lions estab-
lished a community fund to address the 
short-term and long-term needs of indi-
viduals arising from that tragic event. 
To date, they have raised more than 
$11 
million 
for 
those 
affected 
by 
posttraumatic shock disorder, includ-
ing many children of Sandy Hook Ele-
mentary School. Connecticut Lions 
recognized the desperate need of Hurri-
cane Katrina victims, donating thou-
sands of dollars and making multiple 
trips with shipments of vital supplies. 
Connecticut Lions have collected and 
provided food year-round, working with 
meal centers, food banks, and food 
share programs to distribute directly 
to our homeless and those in need. Po-
lice and first responders in many towns 
were provided with ‘‘Homeless Kits.’’ 
In the face of tragedy and immense 
need, the Connecticut Lions have never 
forgotten the importance of looking to 
the future. Connecticut’s youth have 
been a significant part of Lions Club 
service programs. Leadership, Experi-
ence, 
Opportunity—LEO—Clubs 
give 
our youth an opportunity to serve their 
communities and develop their leader-
ship skills. The Lions Quest program 
brings schools, families, and commu-
nities together to promote the develop-
ment of healthy and responsible young 
people through social and emotional 
learning, character development, and a 
commitment to community service. 
The International Peace Poster Con-
test has provided an opportunity for 
children to express their visions of 
peace through art and creativity. Out-
standing students striving to reach 
higher 
academic 
achievement 
have 
been provided significant scholarships 
as rewards for their incredible work. 
We are proud of our Connecticut 
Lions who are, each one, a solid citizen 
contributing 
significantly 
to 
their 
community and beyond. They strive for 
new ways to serve others and to ad-
dress the needs of their communities. 
Connecticut Lions are adept at recog-
nizing needs, planning projects, orga-
nizing fundraisers, and rolling their 
sleeves up to get the job done. ‘‘Where 
there is a need, there is a Lion!’’ For 
100 years, our Connecticut Lions have 
proudly 
demonstrated 
their 
motto: 
‘‘We Serve’’∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DAVE LEE 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
today I rise to honor and pay tribute to 
Dave Lee, a radio host and Minnesota 
legend who is retiring after 32 years at 
WCCO radio on April 30, 2021. 
Hailing from Hatton, ND, Dave did 
not always know he would be a radio 
personality. He spent his summers in 
high school throwing hay bales, pick-
ing potatoes, and hoeing beets. When a 
friend recommended he audition for 
KRAD, a local radio station in East 
Grand Forks, Dave was just hoping to 
earn a little extra money for college, 
but the station saw a spark in him and 
offered him 9-hour country music shift. 
From there, he volunteered to help out 
with sports coverage, and when he 
graduated college, he stayed at the sta-
tion. As he puts it, ‘‘When you are pas-
sionate about something, it never feels 
like you are going to work.’’ 
That is how Dave’s voice was intro-
duced to the airwaves, and after years 
at KRAD in East Grand Forks and 
KFGO in Fargo, he became a weekend 
host of News Talk 830 on WCCO. He 
didn’t know at the time, but WCCO 
would be his home for the next 32 
years. Dave went on to join the leg-
endary Roger Erickson as cohost of the 
morning drive and then took on solo 
duties when Roger retired in 1997. 
For many Minnesotans, Dave’s voice 
was as much a part of their morning as 
their cup of coffee. Commuters counted 
on him for traffic updates, students 
looked to him for snow day announce-
ments, and we all knew we could rely 
on him for honest news reporting and 
engaging interviews. Over the course of 
his career, he interviewed an impres-
sive roster of personalities, from Bos-
ton Celtics legend Bill Russell, to base-
ball pitcher Nolan Ryan, to actress 
Julie Andrews. He also had countless 
incredible interviews with elected offi-
cials Democrats and Republicans alike. 
Some conversations were serious, 
talking about the policy fight or issue 
of the day, but sometimes his inter-
views were just plain fun. I still have 
great memories of joining him at the 
WCCO booth at the Minnesota State 
Fair and ‘‘Minnesota Hospital’’ soap 
opera spoof skit, where I was given the 
role of Nurse Helen and Sid Hartman 
played the infamous ‘‘Dr. Kidney Hart-
man.’’ 
For years, we have also been treated 
to Dave’s sports coverage. He did the 
play-by-play for the Minnesota Go-
phers for a decade and occasionally 
filled in as announcer for the Min-
nesota Twins. He brought his running 
commentary to the television broad-
casts of the Minnesota State High 
School Boys and Girls Basketball Tour-
naments and covered University of St. 
Thomas football games on WCCO. 
His joyful and informative com-
mentary made him a six-time winner of 
Minnesota’s Sportscaster of the Year, 
and he earned three Emmy Awards for 
his reporting on television. He is also a 
recipient of the Edward R. Murrow 
Award, several awards from the Associ-
ated Press, and a nomination for the 
National Association of Broadcasters’ 
Marconi Radio Award. 
To so many Minnesotans, Dave was a 
titan of Minnesota radio, providing in-
formation and entertainment with his 
signature warm demeanor. And it was 
with that same kind spirit that Dave 
did so much to give back, raising hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars for the 
University 
of 
Minnesota 
Children’s 
Hospital. After all Dave has done for 
our community, I have to admit, he de-
serves the chance to start sleeping in. 
Dave, even though I will miss having 
you on the airwaves, I know that this 
is not goodbye, and I wish you all my 
best.∑

TRIBUTE TO VICTORIA CECH 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
rise today to extend my sincere appre-
ciation to Victoria Cech, who is plan-
ning on retiring from her position as 
the executive director of the Montana 
Health Research and Education Foun-
dation. The citizens of my State are 
truly grateful for her tireless efforts to 
improve thehealth of all Montanans. 
During her tenure at the foundation, 
Victoria was responsible for managing 
our State’s hospital flexibility and 
frontier community health improve-
ment programs, both of which provide 
vital support to our State’s critical ac-
cess hospitals. Why is this important? 
Because Montana has the distinction if 
not losing a single critical access hos-
pital since the program’s inception. It 
is the work of the foundation and Vic-
toria’s tireless leadership that has con-
tributed to this great success.

April 27, 2021 
But her work did not stop there. She 
continued to lead efforts to improve 
care in Montana by expanding two of 
the area health education centers man-
aged by the foundation. These efforts 
led the charge in addressing behavioral 
health needs in our State, even bring-
ing national attention to Montana 
when the foundation partnered with 
the National Council for Behavioral 
Health and Lady Gaga’s Born This Way 
Foundation to complete the Teen Men-
tal Health First Aid pilot program at 
Jefferson High School in Boulder. 
Patient safety and quality improve-
ment are also major focuses of the 
foundation. Victoria pioneered these 
efforts, leading a quality improvement 
team that moved Montana’s hospitals 
into the highest ranked position within 
the Hospital Improvement Innovation 
Network hosted by the American Hos-
pital Association’s Health Research & 
Education Trust. 
In 2014, Victoria was at the helm of 
the foundation when our country saw 
its first Ebola patient. The foundation 
was managing the hospital prepared-
ness 
program—HPP—which 
it 
con-
tinues to do today. With five Montana 
residents under Ebola surveillance, the 
preparedness program quickly ramped 
up to raise awareness in hospitals 
across the State. That preparedness 
work has expanded dramatically since 
then, bringing in four full-time plan-
ners who played a large role in helping 
Montana prepare for and manage the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
All 50 States are also experiencing an 
epidemic of drug addiction and opioid 
use that has hit Montana particularly 
hard, especially on the high line. The 
Montana Hospital Association and its 
foundation took this reality to heart 
and worked to expand its education 
and engagement work to move the nee-
dle 
on 
reversing 
opioid 
addiction. 
Under Victoria’s leadership, the foun-
dation was successful in securing a 
Rural Communities Opioid Response 
Program grant that is currently help-
ing to address opioid addiction along 
the Canadian border and increasing en-
gagement in our Tribal communities. 
With all the work that Victoria has 
done, she has not overlooked the needs 
of her team members or those of the 
Montana Hospital Association. When 
the pandemic halted in-person edu-
cation in Helena area schools, Victoria 
looked for a solution to support the 
parents at the association and ulti-
mately converted the educational cen-
ter into a classroom for virtual learn-
ing, dubbed the MHA Learning Center. 
Staffed by a full-time teacher, parents 
could now go to work knowing their 
children would not slip in their class-
work and instead continue to make 
educational gains. 
A lifelong learner, her passion for 
education will continue after her re-
tirement as she supports her husband 
and president of Carroll College, John 
Cech, in positioning the college to be a 
national leader in higher education. 
Victoria is a gifted leader who has 
had a meaningful impact on the lives of 
all Montanans, and we are very grate-
ful for her dedication to keeping folks 
healthy across the Big Sky State. 
Congratulations, Victoria Cech, on 
your much deserved retirement.∑

Michigan, Senator PETERS, in intro-
ducing the Animal Freedom from Test-
ing, Experiments, and Research Act, 
known as the AFTER Act, to promote 
the adoption or retirement of animals 
used for research by Federal agencies. 
In fiscal year 2019, the Federal gov-
ernment 
experimented 
on 
approxi-
mately 38,000 animals for research pur-
poses. 
These 
experiments 
occurred 
across fourteen different federal agen-
cies. The animals used were mainly 
cats, 
dogs, 
monkeys, 
and 
rabbits. 
Tracking these animals following ex-
perimentation is challenging. In many 
instances, animals no longer needed for 
research are killed since many agen-
cies lack formal retirement or adop-
tion 
policies. 
Recent 
peer-reviewed 
studies indicate that research animals 
that are adopted, however, often thrive 
in their new environments. 
In 2013, led by Senators Harkin, Alex-
ander, CANTWELL and myself, the Sen-
ate passed the CHIMP Act, which al-
lowed for the retirement of hundreds of 
primates that were formerly used in 
National Institute of Health (NIH) ex-
periments. In addition, the Depart-
ments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, 
FDA, and NIH recently enacted suc-
cessful 
animal 
retirement 
policies. 
While I am encouraged by the Senate’s 
past work on primates and the recent 
policies developed by a few Federal 
agencies, there are many other Federal 
agencies, including the Agriculture De-
partment, NASA, and the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, that lack 
formal policies for animals used in ex-
periments. 
The AFTER Act builds on successful 
policies at DOD, VA, and NIH by di-
recting all Federal agencies to promul-
gate regulations that would facilitate 
the retirement of laboratory animals. 
The bill provides flexibility for each 
agency to devise its own policy, with 
the goal of ensuring that such animals, 
whenever possible, are retired and not 
killed. Additionally, the AFTER Act 
requires that animals be evaluated by a 
licensed veterinarian and pronounced 
both mentally and physically healthy 
before leaving an agency. This will help 
ensure a smooth transition to a new 
environment. 
Our legislation also encourages Fed-
eral agencies to work with non-profit 
organizations to help place retired ani-
mals in sanctuaries and shelters across 
the country, not just those closest to 
the research facility. This would allow 
a State like Maine, which does not 
have Federal research labs that use 
animals, to play a role in retiring these 
animals and providing homes for them. 
Mr. President, animals that are suit-
able for adoption or retirement should 
not be killed by our Federal govern-
ment. The AFTER Act would provide 
the necessary direction Federal agen-
cies need in order to move forward with 
developing retirement policies. I urge 
all of my colleagues to join in support 
of this important bipartisan legisla-
tion, the Animal Freedom from Test-
ing, Experiments, and Research Act.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Consider 
Teachers Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. TEACH GRANTS. 
Section 420N of the Higher Education Act 
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g–2) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (b)(1)— 
(A) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ‘‘(re-
ferred to in this section as the ‘service obli-
gation window’)’’ after ‘‘under this subpart’’; 
(B) in subparagraph (C)(vii), by inserting 
‘‘or geographic area’’ after ‘‘field’’; and 
(C) by striking subparagraphs (D) and (E) 
and inserting the following: 
‘‘(D) submit a certification of employment 
by the chief administrative officer of the 
school in accordance with subsection (d)(5); 
and 
‘‘(E) meet all State certification require-
ments for teaching (which may include 
meeting such requirements through a certifi-
cation obtained through alternative routes 
to teaching);’’; 
(2) in subsection (c)— 
(A) by striking ‘‘In the event’’ and insert-
ing the following: 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In the event’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(2) RECONSIDERATION OF CONVERSION DECI-
SIONS.— 
‘‘(A) REQUEST TO RECONSIDER.—In any case 
where the Secretary has determined that a 
recipient of a grant under this subpart has 
failed or refused to comply with the service 
obligation in the agreement under sub-
section (b) and has converted the grant into 
a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 
under part D in accordance with paragraph 
(1), (including a TEACH Grant converted to a 
loan prior to the date of enactment of the 
Consider Teachers Act of 2021 and including 
cases where such loans have been fully or 
partially paid), the recipient may request 
that the Secretary reconsider such initial de-
termination and may submit additional in-
formation to demonstrate satisfaction of the 
service obligation. Upon receipt of such a re-
quest, the Secretary shall reconsider the de-
termination in accordance with this para-
graph not later than 90 days after the date 
that such request was received. 
‘‘(B) RECONSIDERATION.—If, in reconsid-
ering an initial determination under sub-
paragraph (A) (including reconsideration re-
lated to a TEACH Grant that was converted 
to a loan prior to the date of enactment of 
the Consider Teachers Act of 2021 and includ-
ing cases where such loans were fully or par-
tially paid), the Secretary determines that 
the reason for such determination was the 
recipient’s failure to timely submit a certifi-
cation required under subsection (b)(1)(D) (as 
in effect on the day before the date of enact-
ment of the Consider Teachers Act of 2021), 
an error or processing delay by the Sec-
retary, a change to the fields considered eli-
gible for fulfillment of the service obligation 
(as described in subsection (b)(1)(C)), a re-
cipient having previously requested to have 
the TEACH Grant converted to a loan, or an-
other valid reason determined by the Sec-
retary, and that the recipient has, as of the 
date of the reconsideration, demonstrated 
that the recipient did meet, or is meeting 
the service obligation in the agreement 
under subsection (b), the Secretary shall— 
‘‘(i) discharge the Federal Direct Unsub-
sidized Stafford Loan under part D, and rein-
state the recipient’s grant under this sub-
part; 
‘‘(ii) discharge any interest or fees that 
may have accumulated during the period 
that the grant was converted to a Federal 
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under 
part D; 
‘‘(iii) if the recipient has other loans under 
part D, apply any payments made for the 
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 
under part D during such period to those 
other loans under part D; 
‘‘(iv) if the recipient does not have other 
loans under part D, reimburse the recipient 
for any amounts paid on the Federal Direct 
Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under part D 
during such period; 
‘‘(v) request that consumer reporting agen-
cies remove any negative credit reporting 
due to the conversion of the TEACH Grant to 
a loan; and 
‘‘(vi) use the additional information pro-
vided under subparagraph (A) to determine 
the progress the recipient has made in meet-
ing the service obligation. 
‘‘(C) EXTENSION OF TIME TO COMPLETE SERV-
ICE OBLIGATION.—In the case of a recipient 
whose TEACH Grant was reinstated in ac-
cordance with subparagraph (B), the Sec-
retary shall, upon such reinstatement— 
‘‘(i) extend the time remaining for the re-
cipient to fulfill the service obligation de-
scribed in subsection (b)(1) to a period of 
time equal to— 
‘‘(I) 8 years; minus 
‘‘(II) the number of full academic years of 
teaching that the recipient completed prior 
to the reconversion of the loan to a TEACH 
Grant under subparagraph (B), including any 
years of qualifying teaching completed dur-
ing the period when the TEACH Grant was in 
loan status; and 
‘‘(ii) treat any full academic years of 
teaching described in clause (i)(II) as years 
that count toward the individual’s service 
obligation (regardless of whether the TEACH 
Grant funds were in grant or loan status) if 
that time otherwise meets the requirements 
of this section.’’; and 
(3) in subsection (d), by adding at the end 
the following: 
‘‘(3) COMMUNICATION WITH RECIPIENTS.—The 
Secretary shall notify TEACH grant recipi-
ents not less than once per calendar year re-
garding how to submit the employment cer-
tification under subsection (b)(1)(D) and the 
recommendations and requirements for sub-
mitting that certification under subsection 
(d)(5). 
‘‘(4) QUALIFYING
SCHOOLS
AND
HIGH-NEED 
FIELDS.—The Secretary shall maintain and 
annually update a list of qualifying schools 
as described in subsection (b)(1)(B), and a list 
of high-need fields as described in subsection 
(b)(1)(C) and shall make such lists publicly 
available on the Department’s website in a 
sortable and searchable format.’’. 
SEC. 3. SUBMISSION OF EMPLOYMENT CERTIFI-
CATION. 
Section 420N(d) of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g–2(d)), as amended 
by section 2, is further amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(5) SUBMISSION
OF
EMPLOYMENT
CERTIFI-
CATION.— 
‘‘(A) RECOMMENDED SUBMISSIONS.—The Sec-
retary shall notify TEACH Grant recipients 
that 
the 
Department 
recommends 
that 
TEACH Grant recipients submit the employ-
ment certification described in subsection 
(b)(1)(D) as soon as practicable after the 
completion of each year of service. 
‘‘(B) 
REQUIRED
SUBMISSION.—A 
TEACH 
Grant recipient shall be required to submit 
to the Department employment certification 
within the timeframe that would allow that 
individual to complete their service obliga-
tion before the end of the service obligation 
window. 
‘‘(C) NOTIFICATION.—The Secretary shall 
notify TEACH Grant recipients of the re-
quired submission deadlines described in this 
paragraph. 
‘‘(D) ADJUSTMENT OF DEADLINE.—The Sec-
retary shall adjust the submission deadline 
described in subparagraph (B) to account for 
a service obligation window extension. 
‘‘(E) ALTERNATIVE TO CERTIFICATION.—The 
Secretary shall provide an alternative to the 
certification of employment described in 
subsection (b)(1)(D) for recipients who can-
not obtain such required certification of em-
ployment from the chief administrative offi-
cer of the school because the recipient can 
demonstrate the school is no longer in exist-
ence or the school refuses to cooperate.’’. 
SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF TIME TO FULFILL SERV-
ICE OBLIGATION DUE TO COVID–19. 
(a) Section 3519(a) of the CARES Act (Pub-
lic Law 116–136; 20 U.S.C. 1001 note) is amend-
ed— 
(1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1),
